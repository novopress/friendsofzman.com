        Yeah, I remember about five years ago or so (maybe more), it hit me like a ton of bricks: I want a divorce from these people. I was tired of arguing with lefties and CivNats. We were simply different people with completely different views on the the world. We couldn‚Äôt compromise because there was no middle ground. We hated each other but were living under the same roof. It was best for all if we just went our separate ways ‚Äì whatever the costs.Once you reach that point, it‚Äôs impossible to go back. Every argument just re-enforces what you already know, that it‚Äôs over.

            Citizen, I agree.  On top of everything else, we have been prohibited, by threat of banishment or arrest, from even being allowed to articulate our arguments and preferences in public.

            I agree, but they will not let us go without another all out civil war.  And this time, the dissidents are not neatly organized by state.

            Agree. We cannot come to terms with either group. Nor will they leave us alone. They are intent on ramming their ideology down our throats at the point of a gun and then disposing of us later.
F**k them. They are making a civil war inevitable.

        ‚ÄúThey will stop voting and stop thinking their future lies with democratic solutions.‚ÄùMe since 2018.  I gave Trump and his neo-con clown car more than a year to begin credibly implementing his ‚Äúthe first day I am President‚Ä¶‚Äù promises.  I understood there‚Äôs a gap between campaign rhetoric and governing with a ‚Äúresistance.‚Äù  But he kept hiring too many ‚Äúresisters‚Äù and ‚Äúnevers‚Äù for me to continue believing this was anything but another Con, Inc. grift to MIGA.I largely checked out when John Bolton‚Äôs cuck-stache reappeared in the West Wing.  I cared more about immigration than foreign policy, but Bolton was a final straw that showed Trump, if he was ever legit, had been converged.  Giving Israel ‚ÄúPurim miracles‚Äù while letting the border I live on disintegrate even further was just too much to bear.Throw in Jeb-isms like ‚Äújust look at that black unemployment rate‚Äù [fake news ‚Äì another U6 shuffle ala Obama] and I could no longer stomach my orange potatoes.I‚Äôm in the ‚Äúworking for the Third Founding‚Äù compartment.  Adios, Empire.

                There‚Äôs a reasonable argument that Trump has simply been coerced into cucking, or that he‚Äôs feckless.  That said, all the more reason to place no trust in the system, to consider the Empire our enemy and to work to separate ourselves from its clutches.

                And it is yet another DODO who believes Trump has a magic wand and if he doesn‚Äôt wave it to bring a better world into being by saying ‚ÄúBippity Bobbity Boo‚Äù he just is not worthy of Mel Blanc‚Äôs adulation.  As far as his ‚Äúability‚Äù I‚Äôd point out that he has billions, is president of the USA, and sleeps with a supermodel while having a private jet whose bumper sticker reads, ‚ÄúMy Other Plane Is Air-Force One.‚Äù I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs pretty much run the table so far.

                    Could not agree more, sir.  This spot we find ourselves in was generations in the making, and that system does have real power to defend itself. The idea that any one man would remedy all its ills overnight was always naive to put it kindly. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve seen the full cadre of forces arrayed against him even yet.
Trump may not be ‚Äúone of us‚Äù (however you define it), but he‚Äôs a clear step in the right direction.

            I‚Äôm not asserting you are wrong, but that you might not be right. We real American are in possession of NONE of the control nodes of our own civilization, and half of Pres. Trump‚Äôs support comes from weak people who will abandon him to defeat and destruction if the marxist-globalists can paint him as a racist/bigot convincingly enough to preference-cascade their social approval networks. He HAS to kiss all these asses: some of (and especially) the Jewish factions, the gays, and the various diversities to prevent this.There isn‚Äôt a goyim on this planet who can play Jewish factions off against each other, when they ALL know exactly what he is doing, and still succeed. The man is a big damn hero in my book, and I‚Äôm supporting him until he is finished. His vision of the future is not one that I want, but if it were feasible it would be one that my nation would not be eradicated under.Pres. Trump is trying to get real Americans in as stakeholders of the empire, alongside the other nations of the empire. He is failing. The current imperial ruling class does NOT want *any* real Americans inside the control nodes, because they know that we do not want to join the empire, but rather to destroy it and expel its minions from our land. So he WILL fail. But another 4 years of Trump is another 4 years of peace and preparation, another 4 years I get to live, so he gets my support.

            I‚Äôve seen plenty of signs that Trump is learning on the job, as any President must do. He has become much savvier in who gets key jobs in his administration.  Sessions‚Äì&gt;Barr, Tillerson-&gt;Pompeo.   Great choices so far for SCOTUS, and reportedly good choices for most lower court nominees as well.   No grave GWB SCOTUS nominee mistakes like Roberts.
We must also remember that no President in our lifetimes, and likely EVER has faced an organized resistance that includes members of the ‚ÄúGOP‚Äù.

            I fear he‚Äôs another example of ‚ÄúTell both sides whatever they want to hear, because we still own both parties.‚Äù
Trump voters heard our wish list, and Hillary voters heard theirs.
Ivanka and Chelsea were both assured a future, especially since both are having Tribal children.

        It seems that many people are under the illusion that they can live in a white (orderly and prosperous) society while at the same time banishing all the white people.  Good luck with that.  ‚ÄúPopulists‚Äù understand it, consciously or subconsciously.In speaking to a church congregational counselor/coach recently, she said that the poison in a congregation is never a person, but it is something else that needs to be identified.  In that spirit, IMHO our cultural poison is that the people are being taught to banish all the white people and grab all their physical and cultural stuff.  The elites are willing to weaponize that attitude.  So here we are.  The rest of it all stems from this poison.  Trump and Obama and Hillary are just little markers and totems in the bigger game.As part of this counseling/coaching thing, we were paired off with other congregants one-on-one, in order to practice silently listening to what others have to say.  My partner was this ancient solitary man from one of the local old folks homes, no doubt hobbling out to give his brain some exercise.  He wasn‚Äôt a familiar face and came alone.  He talked about how it was ‚Äúall over‚Äù, the kids live in another world, no one listens to anyone any more, and all the ‚Äúget off my lawn‚Äù stuff.  Later, under my questioning, he explained that he grew up on a family farm in Iowa, was part of a small town, and ‚Äúeveryone thinked alike and looked out for each other, and that kind of thing is all gone now‚Äù.  Bingo.  We aren‚Äôt going back, there is no ‚Äúback‚Äù to go to.  What was once the cultural mainstream is now a subversive lifestyle.

        You‚Äôre seeing the breakdown in the sputtering efforts to get a new war started. Back in 2003 heritage America still believed in the institutions (foolishly, I might add), and that we were a righteous nation united in freedumb or some such nonsense. Trump has opened his regime doors to every discredited Republican hack and even the shrinking White majority is having second thoughts about the ‚Äúshining city on the hill.‚Äù

        There was a thing in the news the other day that I thought was a good metaphor for all this: there was a kids‚Äô national spelling bee, and the prize had to be shared by 8 Indian kids because the little pajeets had all crammed their brains out and memorized the entire damn dictionary.This is about as un-American as it gets.  A spelling bee serves two purposes:1.  Reinforces for kids the value of good spelling, and2.  Is a fun kind of event so that the smart, nerdy kids who are no good at sports can get to have a big contest and win some trophies too.  You‚Äôre supposed to be able to spell ‚Äúrhinoceros,‚Äù not bizarre medical terminology.These foreigners misunderstand the entire social concept and instead weaponize something as silly as a spelling bee in order to secure some imaginary advantage about getting into Princeton.  Somehow it never occurs to these striving geniuses to build another Princeton, though.  It‚Äôs like you went to your kid‚Äôs dance recital and some Chinese millionaire hired the Bolshoi Ballet to dance for his kid.It‚Äôs not going to be possible to share a country with this sort of people.  And they‚Äôre super-busy hoovering the whole place up, so you better start making some realistic IRL plans.

            This is why their own country is a giant shit hole. They are not builders by nature but exploiters and users.  This is why you will never see a rich Brahman built their equivalent of the Getty or donate money for a public performing arts center, etc.
The only thing to do with such people is give them the boot. Seriously they are highly nepotistic and predatory and really don‚Äôt contribute to our society at all.

        The system will rot and decay. The ruling class, unable to solve the problems or unify the mess they have created will simply default to cynically exercising power and privilege. Their sepoys will rape and loot the civilisation extracting wealth and humiliation from the former majority with the blessing of the overclass.White America will become increasingly alienated, increasingly aware of its new position as dalits in the secular hinduism we call Intersectionality. This is the breaking point..the point at which whites no longer think of the government as US but as THEY.A group of aspiring elites or perhaps a faction of the ruling tribal coalition that is shut out of power will begin looking for the allies it needs to build a new coalition, and it will find them in the dispossessed and seething white america.

            That‚Äôs the usual process for ‚Äúcirculating the elites‚Äù when the present cabal tries to hang on too long.  I thought Trump was that ‚Äúclass traitor‚Äù but he was either unwilling or unable to fill those shoes. We seething dispossessed are still waiting for our revolutionary leaders.  Soft secession via ‚Äúvoting with our feet‚Äù and cafeteria Federalism where we pick and choose which Empire policies we will follow is probably the best short-mid term option.  States and cities legalizing drugs &amp; illegal immigration are showing it‚Äôs possible.

                Trumps problem is that he is only one person. What is needed is a strong faction of the elite willing to mobilise, finance and organise. I‚Äôm betting this faction will emerge from the democrats, and i have a suspicion its vanguard will be a mix of frustrated east asians and non-conforming alt-black types.

                Exile, That was generally my thought in reading Z-man‚Äôs essay.  Remove oneself from the system as best as possible and let it try to function without us.  However, I hesitated because that concept was stated a long time ago by that hated (Libertarianish?) Ayn Rand in Atlas Shrugged.

                Trump seems to really believe in America and has the old style thinking that goes with it.  He‚Äôs been mediocre in a lot of areas and could have done better.  However, he‚Äôs faced a soft coup attempt, district judges making national rulings, a lack of any significant part of the establishment rallying to his side, and a Congress that doesn‚Äôt support any of what he campaigned on.
Had Trump done everything he promised, it would only have delayed the inevitable.  Instead, the resistance he‚Äôs faced has only pushed things along.

            My memory of the seventies was of a sort of Weimar period.  The damage was done but the old order found their way in the most perverse exercises of taste and judgement.  I felt like an innocent in an asylum.  In retrospect, it was a fascinating time, and it is interesting how the people today treat the artifacts (the clothes, the photos, the music, the movies) with little comprehension of the true fundamental dissonance we lived through at the time.On some level it offers hope that there is a future for us today.  But one has to remember that the ‚Äò70s was a white thing, the white culture may have been disintegrating, but it was white.  Not the mud pie we have today.

                Z made a great point about the 70‚Äôs a few weeks back.
In short, architecture of that time was hideous and reflected the rot, but the population hadn‚Äôt yet.  Now, architecture looks much better, perhaps as a way of coping with the absence of a ‚Äúvolk.‚Äù
Look at the beautiful recent structures in post-America Los Angeles (The Getty Center &amp; The Grove are two great examples).  White architecture will outlive white people.

        Back in the 1860s, Walt Whitman wrote the great line ‚ÄúI hear America singing, the varied carols I hear.‚Äù  Many of us at this site had to learn that poem in grade school, and we all knew implicitly what Whitman meant, and we all had the same idea as this long-dead extremely gay man had had about what ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù meant.That country is gone.  What we have now is a giant cookie jar, and the word is out on the street to every grifter and swindler on the planet that it‚Äôs OK to come here, grub around in the cookie jar, grab as many cookies as you can, and nobody will stop you, least of all the White people who built the place.  What we have in terms of social order is really just a barely-upheld agreement that it would not be nice to attack the people who are plundering us.  That‚Äôs about as good as it gets in terms of civility.Nobody is happy with this arrangement except the foreigners, who increasingly come not from the hopefuls but from the Third World swindler/grifter class.  The people buying up your housing stock with suitcases full of laundered cash (and bidding up the price so that increasingly, homes can only be bought by other foreign grifters) are people who managed to swindle a few million out of their countrymen then high-tail it over here to take advantage of a social order they have no intention of respecting.  Some fellow-citizens they‚Äôll turn out to be.  America was the Land of Opportunity, now it‚Äôs just the Land of Opportunists.  The whole thing is obviously untenable.Fortunately North America is a very big place, and it should be possible to carve out a White ethnostate about the combined size of France, Germany and Poland.  The big question is can that be done without violence.

                Lineman‚Ä¶.I just woke up to an ugly truth, and feel foolish..not stupid ..just foolish.wandering in the land of fluffy bunnies and unicorn‚Ä¶ and not getting this.  Am reading book by Charles Adams ‚ÄúWhen in the Course of Human Events-Arguing the Case for Southern Secession.‚Äù‚ÄúLike all Northerners, I was force-fed Lincoln adoration from early school days on into university history courses.‚Äù I had no idea what suspension of Writ of Habeas Corpus meant, Lincoln just took power, convened congress 3 months after calling up the troops and rolling out with war. Politically correct‚Ä¶we ain‚Äôt seen nothing yet! He shut down newspapers, and if some papers wrote contrary editorials, he jailed the editors to shut them up. Threatened to jail SC justice Roger Taney. Pro-succession was considered tyranny and a jailable offense. This is a tough word to use but dictator may apply.Point is:  succession ain‚Äôt happening‚Ä¶not in my lifetime. What was I thinking. The globalist left will not let us go. Land‚Ä¶resources and power. Sigh‚Ä¶of course. They will pull the full on Lincoln and beat us into submission. Civil war will erupt after the Lincoln treatment and will last a long time. Not done without much and protracted violence. They don‚Äôt want to let us go. We are way past the Dec of Independence, rule of law. The left is literally lawless, and wave the bloody cloth of the Constitution in front of RINOS and CivNats to blind them and shut them up, with no intention of following the rules..they make them up.Your point of view?

            Assume for the moment that we carve out that white ethnostate somewhere in North America. It would get complicated in a hurry, specifically with regard to foreign policy. Which nations would be friendly to us? Which nations openly hostile? Would we have access to ports? Without access to the ocean, our ethnostate could not survive. And it would need a very powerful military to intimidate any would-be invader. At some point, war would come as a result of any number of factors. Whites would realize that the ‚Äúother‚Äù would never leave them alone. We would have to conquer in order to gain peace and respect. Some kind of terrible example would have to be made of a hostile power. Whites came to where we are through the fires of war. We have to go right back down that path to regain our former position. It‚Äôs going to be all or nothing.

                Epaminondas ‚Äì I‚Äôve recommended them before, but let me again suggest reading the Covington books.  Not saying they‚Äôre utterly realistic or the road to follow, but he does address all those follow on questions ‚Äì foreign policy, defense, domestic policy to re-accustom the population to a moral and White nation, etc.  Made me really think about what it would take ‚Äì and made me fully jettison the ‚Äúreturn to the Constitution‚Äù canard.

        ‚ÄúIt is safe to assume that the marginalized supporters who came out to vote for Trump will be forever divorced from the shared consent of the people. They will stop voting and stop thinking their future lies with democratic solutions.‚Äù
This is me.  I think the final straw was seeing Trump go full NeoCon after a minor setback in 2018.
I‚Äôll be honest, I don‚Äôt have a clue what comes next.  But this nonsense needs to be over.  I see no reason to participate in electoral democracy other than to metaphorically ‚Äúcrash the plane with no survivors.‚Äù

        Easter Sunday I went for a run in my city‚Äôs Central Park (coastal Orange County).  The place was packed with, mostly but not exclusively hispanic, families having picnics.  In the time I was there I counted more than a dozen ‚Äústreet vendors‚Äù with push carts selling food and trinkets.   It was pretty weird, and not ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù at all.  I also know that it‚Äôs illegal for them to do so (not that I care more much either way).It‚Äôs kind of a microcosm of what Z is talking about.   You don‚Äôt see that type of thing in native crowds, because it‚Äôs not legal so it‚Äôs not part time of the culture.  And that norm is enforced by policing and fines.   But here there was a large gathering in the center of a suburban city (police hq is literally only 1-2 miles away) in a giant metro area with a complete ignoring of the legal regime and the powers that be didn‚Äôt care enough to attempt to enforce the law.That‚Äôs the direction CA has been headed for some time.  The politicians enact their laws, but he public ignores them and the cops don‚Äôt care enough to enforce.   For now, white people mostly follow the law out of habit.  How long that will last is anyone‚Äôs guess. It‚Äôs reminiscent of Latin America, or Italy and Greece.

            Can confirm. OC was a rare White Right oasis in California only 20 years ago ‚Äì now it‚Äôs fully Mexified. Santa Ana courts &amp; hospitals are indistinguishable from East Los Angeles.  Classic anarcho-tyranny.  Victor Davis Hanson is at his best on this subject in his Cental CA homeground, street vendors, impromptu trailer parks, drunk driving rampant.  Cops know Whites will pay fines and not shoot at them, and they have to write some tickets sometime, so we get the tyranny.  Those whose poverty and lawlessness make them ‚Äúenforcement-proof‚Äù enjoy the anarchy.

            I know where that is.  It‚Äôs a great park when it‚Äôs empty.  Parks only look nice when they‚Äôre unused.  They‚Äôre magnets for immigrants and pedophiles.  The sad thing about that area is that the flat landers come in to cool off from the places without the marine layer.  I consider them to literally be stealing the cool air that they can‚Äôt afford.

                I was in Carmel, CA recently, which is truly a paradise on earth.  Everyone I saw over 40 was white, and everyone under 40 was Asian.
It was very obvious that the strategy for keeping it beautiful is to turn it over to the Yellows, so that the Browns can‚Äôt have it.

                    Carmel CA has priced a pack of gum so the Browns (or the Blacks) can‚Äôt have it.  They have priced every single element of the cost of living away from the rest of the 99%.  But the Yellows have the bucks to pay the price.  The blockbusting is coming from a different direction on that one.  At least when the Whites get run out of town, they will be paid well for the privilege, unlike most blockbusting exercises.

                        RFF, I love the hell out of Utah.  It‚Äôs tragic that the LDS have allowed the POZ to enter.
I think that BYU was so good at creating effective middle managers that the POZ was inevitable.  Still, the small towns remain monuments to European Man‚Äôs ability to tame nature.  I‚Äôm blessed to have spent time there.

                            Well, Meme, I love the hell out of Utah too. The POZ entered because the church moved beyond the inter mt west, grew beyond the US and became an international church. The church quietly backed Romney and Romney is a globalist pirate‚Ä¶beyond nation. There was no way to stop a missionary based religion outgrowing their clothes, so to speak. Now over 150 temples all over the world and all the money needed to keep the operations going, a majority of members are outside of US and are Marxist-lite. Embrace open borders, embrace the teeming masses, church giving millions to refugee resettlement, and that sets us up for the destruction of our own culture. The irony is there was no way out of the church not eating it‚Äôs own tail.PS: You spent time here in Utah‚Ä¶.where?

                This is the truth, I‚Äôve watched traffic enforcement from up close. Soccer mom gets pulled over and earns a citation for a burned-out licence plate bulb.

Soccer mom can pay and hell, she‚Äôll probably even feel embarrassed and guilty to boot. In the cop‚Äôs defense, who wants to pull over the other three cars and roll the dice on having a ‚Äúsituation‚Äù or adding to the ever-dreaded racial disparity statistic for the city?

A harem is just a lot of work for the variety  and its just as RFF noted , like herding cats
I‚Äôm also too old for that much activity alas

            I live in SoCal.  I don‚Äôt mind Latinos using the parks.  I could be wrong, but it seems like the parks would be vacant without them.  I‚Äôve never really seen whites using them.  Even 10+ years ago. You drive by and see a big Latino extended-family gathering, with bbq, the women making food, balloons, kids, pinatas, and you think ‚Äúgood to see people actually USING the park.‚Äù  They‚Äôre well behaved and clean up afterward.I realize the parks in the real bad areas are a different story.  But normal Mexicans in normal areas don‚Äôt hurt park culture.I went to a park in San Bernardino (meth capital of the world at the time) to play tennis and it was obvious the city had completely given up on it.   I walked into the bathroom and there were a bunch of wacked-out vagrants just hanging out in there.  I was going to use the urinal but there was a black guy standing behind the privacy half-wall jerking off.  I said ‚Äúwhat are you doing?‚Äù  He said ‚Äúnothin‚Äô man‚Äù, and just kept jerking and staring at me.  I think the bathrooms in these broken city parks just become sex &amp; drug dens.

                Spot on. Divorce is not possible. Empires never willingly give up power or territory, let alone admit that they are wrong. Nor is living with the empire feasible for whites any longer as it intends to kill and replace us. In fact they make that quite clear in their propaganda organs like the NYT
You don‚Äôt reason with a cancer that‚Äôs killing you, you excise it.

        What‚Äôs interesting about the libertarian thing is that Trump is a particularly Randian character on the world stage, at least rhetorically.  He makes the case that the U.S. has the right to act in the best interests of the citizens of the country.  Now libertarians may argue about whether particular Trump policies improve welfare or not, but at some gut level they should love Trump for asserting our right not to sacrifice our interests to some poorly defined global collective.And that is what this whole populist thing is all about ‚Äî the elite‚Äôs refusal to act in the country‚Äôs best interest, and in a broader sense, act rationally.  It‚Äôs not so much that they are serving another master, it‚Äôs that they are destabilizing the entire world by their cowardice in facing human nature.  Rand would have despised these people.

            On a personal level (how he lives his life) Trump is the most libertarian man in human history, Caligula being a close runner up.  Every waking minute is about pursuing maximum sensory pleasure for himself.  Things like ‚Äúduty‚Äù and ‚Äúresponsibility‚Äù don‚Äôt concern him.  Your woman starts aging?  Get a new woman.  You owe a sub-contractor a million?  Let him go to court and settle for 300k.   His greatest strength is having zero baggage.  Jeb Bush had the baggage of legacy and desperate approval from the power elite.   The dark side of this is that it also means Trump has zero loyalty to political goals.

                JR, zero loyalty to political goals, and yet, Trump has not let up in the face of strong criticism of/reaction to those same goals?What could have been easier for him than to complete a phony ‚Äúdeal‚Äù with China, call it victory, and move on.  Hell, everyone else before him has.What could have been easier than to avoid the IA fiasco and deal with Dem‚Äôs on an overall immigration plan?  Call it victory and move on.Even the JQ folks get so agitated upon‚Äîlike when he moved the embassy to Jerusalem.  He could have postponed and moved on.I‚Äôm sure we could argue whether any of these goals is worthwhile or could be better obtained, but his drive/loyalty in trying to obtain his goals in the face of overwhelming opposition is better than any President in my memory.Now, he may well ‚Äúscrew the pooch‚Äù before achieving success.  That is the risk we are all in.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

                    Not at all.  Everything he does and says is calibrated to sooth his base while selling them out.  The Jerusalem thing was to keep the Southern Baptist Convention locked down.  It doesn‚Äôt put him out to take up a cause or action because he doesn‚Äôt really believe in any cause or action other than power and pleasure for himself.  And part of his enjoyment is watching huge swaths of people go nuts when he does something.  He gets off on it.  I actually like that about him.  Even though so little has been accomplished.

                    Trump is the ultimate ‚Äúdon‚Äôt give a shit‚Äù attitude kind of guy, which makes it totally difficult for his adversaries.  AG Barr is another one, and is happy to come right out and say it.Trump does give a shit, because he actually answers only to himself.  He will not cut a phony deal with China because he will not allow himself to accept that.  What the rest of us might think about it is a very, very distant second place.Kim Jong Un understands Trump‚Äôs need to answer to himself.  Un‚Äôs execution of the people who were negotiating with Trump and his people, whatever else it might be, is also an exploration of the definition and boundaries of how Trump answers to himself.  Will such an act, done to presumably accomplished, loyal, and meaningful players in the negotiating game, alter Trump‚Äôs negotiating calculus?

        Beattie‚Äôs article gets the rise in cynicism right but inverts the reasons why.He essentially argues that the steak of nationalism was the subject but the sizzle of Trump‚Äôs populist style was what closed the sale.  Maybe for some.  But for most of his voters he got their votes in spite of his style and because of the substance of his implied white nationalism.Beattie argues that you need to deliver some actual concrete promised accomplishments, but it‚Äôs the populist salesmanship that matters more than what‚Äôs being sold‚Ä¶Populism used correctly can eclipse nationalism and replace it with something more‚Ä¶kosher.Then he gets to his real concern‚Ä¶DT should have enlisted AIPAC in the immigration debate: less undesirables,  no Ilan Omar types, no BDS, better security for Israel.And that‚Äôs why we need to embrace populism.

            There is a great divide on the Israel issue, as it relates to domestic politics. Some like to admiringly point out Israel has a wall, close to a zero immigration policy and an ethno-nationalist attitude. Others flip this around and use those policies to bash Israel to American liberals.
Mike Enoch hates Israel, so he loves pointing out how Israelis treat Arabs. RamZPaul on the other hand, celebrates Israeli immigration policy as a good example for America.

                I‚Äôd like Israel‚Äôs policies to be implemented in America.  I detest its influence in American politics.Don‚Äôt give a damn about the Arab-Israeli conflict otherwise.

                I agree with Enoch (by way of MacDonald) that Israel‚Äôs immigration policies are exactly what Jewish leadership doesn‚Äôt want for goyim, because goy cohesion = pogroms in the Ashkepathic mindset (h/t Heartiste).  As much as David Cole‚Äôs tone &amp; style annoy me to death, he‚Äôs one of the few Jews in media pushing his tribe to lay off the paranoia.  If it weren‚Äôt for Jewish meddling in Gentile domestic affairs, I would be indifferent to the JQ.  Unfortunately, we‚Äôre light years from that in every Western country.

                Since our current immigration plan is a product of the Kushner-AIPAC wing of the internal Jewish debate I thought Beattie‚Äôs use of AIPAC was telling and hilarious.Pointing out hypocrisy to the Tribe is wasted effort. Ramzpaul used to engage in a lot of edgy satire, an option no longer available to him if he wants to stay on youtube.  ‚ÄúEasy Bake Ann Frank‚Äù was TRS level stuff.Lighting a fire no matter how small under the tribe day in and day out drives their neuroses to the edge forcing them out into the open and into overreacting.And because they are so hypersensitive it is very easy to do, even obliquely.

                Jews like Shapiro and Prager probably check on the Dissident Right podcasts and sites like AmRen, and observe that ‚Äúanti-Semites‚Äù aren‚Äôt just a few goofballs dressed as Nazis anymore.   They see that it‚Äôs coming from serious, educated thinkers with platforms to spread the word.  If you‚Äôre a Jew with fairly recent images of bulldozers dumping hundreds of naked emaciated kinfolk in a ditch, you‚Äôre not going to be OK with just letting the D-Right do their thing.  You‚Äôre going to think if guys like Enoch get any sort of foothold, it‚Äôs gonna lead to the bulldozers again.  This isn‚Äôt just Jews being paranoid.  It used to be, but it‚Äôs not now.

                    Frip, I admit there are a small number of Dissident Right J3ws who will support immigration restriction.  However, the effort to identify such j3ws would be enormous and many of their offspring would revert back to the mean of cultural subversion.  J3ws are the most ethnocentric people.  Is it worth the effort?
I wonder if you are feeling bad about judging people about qualities that they did not choose.  However, only white people feel bad about such judgments.

                        Per a very prescient comment made in the last few days, too many people, especially upper-middle class white women, are much more interested in earning an ‚ÄúA‚Äù social grade than actually looking at things as they are.  Hence the generational reversion to the pozzed mean.  Only something like radical Islam has had the pure coercive strength to substitute their own report card for the prevailing one, and that leads to ‚Äòsploding peeps.  And the Chinese Communist leadership has picked up on this tendency, in order to institute their social grading system.  Talk about an elite correctly reading the weaknesses of the pozzed!

                        Exile, true AmRen was bad example, I was just typing fast.  ‚Äú75 years ago isn‚Äôt recent.‚Äù  It‚Äôs all relative.  But 1945, compared to say, The Inquisition, or total history, is recent enough.  Especially so, since anything on film (which is the same as watching TV since that‚Äôs how we see the footage) psychologically puts an event in the modern-contemporary-now category.  So if you‚Äôre a Jew the Holocaust is recent.  (I‚Äôm not denying they‚Äôve weaponized it.)LineIn, I don‚Äôt disagree with what you said.  I was just saying that hostility from the D-Right toward Jews, justified or not, can‚Äôt help but rev up already jumpy Jews.  Post WWII the Jews have been knowingly bullshitting about the ‚Äúscourge‚Äù of antisemitism.  But in the last decade they see real ‚Äòantisemitism‚Äô sprouting up in  intelligent form again, this time from something called the Dissident Right.I don‚Äôt think the D-Right should modify its  views.  Just saying that we can‚Äôt really mock the Jews anymore for always thinking the Cossacks are on their trail.  Because we really are on their trail now.  They read and listen to D-Right stuff.  We aren‚Äôt literally calling on them to be killed. But to a Jew we come well close enough! LOL.  When it comes to extermination 75 years ago IS recent.

                            ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the D-Right should modify its views. Just saying that we can‚Äôt really mock the Jews anymore for always thinking the Cossacks are on their trail. ‚Ä¶ We aren‚Äôt literally calling on them to be killed. But to a Jew we come well close enough!‚ÄùNo, we aren‚Äôt calling for a hollow-cost. Many of us just don‚Äôt want our country‚Äôs media, politicians, educational institutions, and economy to be dominated by a tribal subculture that undermines our values.If opposing them politically makes Jews fear pogroms and cattle cars, then they are paranoid in a literal psychiatric sense. You say we should not modify our views, but what then? Shut up because otherwise they‚Äôll think we‚Äôre the Gestapo? I do not favor giving them that power over us. They have enough already.

                    Jews brought this on themselves by subverting their host nations to self-destruct via cultural destruction and demographic replacement.
It‚Äôs hard not to notice Jews at the forefront of all of these movements.
And they can just as easily throttle back on their group hatred of whites so there is no worry. But they won‚Äôt so the animosity keeps building.  They really are their own worst enemies.

        Recovering Libertarian‚Ä¶ like a lot of folks here. It was a difficult slog letting slip the libertarian penchant. Its a wonderfully seductive ideology not unlike Communism. Unlike Communism, libertarianism carries with it native imagery of plucky Founding Fathers, American individualism bearing an organic feel to it that contrasts with the ‚Äúforeign feeling‚Äù pie-in-the-sky promises of Communism.Both become train wrecks when they run up against reality and human nature.  Communism inherently ends up with a body count, and libertarianism has no immunity to inevitable failure.Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I miss the warm feeling of libertarian ideology and the smarmy rapid-fire solutions to all of society‚Äôs problems that the ideology equips you with. I also still have a bad habit on knocking on wood when someone pronounces some impending possible doom‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt believe in mischievous woodsprites but habits die hard. Its taken a lifetime but I‚Äôve grown out of believing in magic.Maybe in some Norman Rockwellian hamlet you could pull off some semblance of a libertarianesque micro-society. Hell, I‚Äôd love to live there, but magical thinking is for children‚Ä¶ not a serious person.

            If you don‚Äôt approach politics with strong libertarian instincts you are fodder for the collectivists.Taking Libertarianism to extremes is the lazy mans approach. It‚Äôs like saying that conservatives want no change, ever- Autos? No,No think of the buggy whip makers!Jordan Peterson lays out the issue fairly clearly.The societies of the West succeed because of the underling belief in individual sovereignty. In pretty much all fields that has produced the richest (in both material and cultural meaning) societies ever seen.The revolution is by tribalists: Peterson uses the example of a tribe of chimpanzees literally tearing to pieces other chimps not of their tribe.(Much to the horror of Liberals at the realization that wariness of strangers and preference for ones own king ‚Äì aka Xenophobia, was genetically, not socially based)For both (most) Blacks and Jews membership in the tribe is their single most important characteristic, that is why they prey upon, rather than assimilate with white societies: it‚Äôs not their tribe.It‚Äôs impossible to point to any one point where things started to go to hell but the Civil Rights Act which destroyed the concept of Freedom of Association was certainly a greasing of the skids, In 1979 Homosexuality was defined in the APA‚Äôs DSM1 as a mental illness, In 2019 you can jailed for not sufficiently celebrating it, you have no chance in hell of not having it rubbed in your face.The underlying issue is, can whites overcome their aversion to tribalism l soon enough and for long enough to ensure the survival of their tribe.

Your post mirrors my own political development.  I am predisposed to individualism but this changed when I became convinced that ethnocentric non-whites were defeating individualistic whites due to their ethnocentrism.  Now I see white collectivism as a necessary defense so that white individualism can exist.

                    Well said LINE.  If we and our heritage are to survive, first must come awareness as a group, actualization and then some form of collective identity and advocacy must follow.  Collective identity and self-defense/advocacy will require a degree of collectivization, but in OUR PEOPLE‚Äôs big tent need to be a large place of honor for individualism and some libertarian principles. It is part of who we are and what we have contributed to the world.

                I grok you in re: having libertarian ‚Äúinstints‚Äù or pedigree in your political foundation. I was expressing the feelz journey from conservative to libertarian to nationalist/RR. I so strongly associated Jeffersonian mythical libertarianism with my American identity that it almost felt like a betrayal to allow reason and reality to transform my thinking from the comfort of the idealized.I‚Äôve always been staunchly anti-collectivist and remain largely so, though a monologue by Zman got me pondering the acceptance or perhaps even desirablility of some collectivized benefits and safety nets for OUR people.Do we not want to foster the prosperity and replication of our tribe or even to some lesser degree time-proven allied tribes? With a degree of societal approval I believe it would be an interesting avenue to look at‚Ä¶ thus another nail in the coffin of my libertarian ideology.

                I suspect that in the end this age will not be the end of whites but *will* be a genetic bottleneck for them that will produce a new race. I live in metro Portland and have a somewhat public facing job where I refrain from saying about 10 words for every one I do say. I see them float through my little realm of employment, the nose pierced (3 just today), the tatted, the bearded soy-fatted manchildren, the shemales in heels, the fat green haired slutwalkers‚Ä¶ all white, all doomed. None of these creatures will have many offspring. It‚Äôs no big loss of course but I can‚Äôt help but think that this is the same genetic material that stormed ashore at Normandy not so long ago. All that cuckery, preening degeneracy, proud self destruction, it was all there somehow, just waiting, like Cthulhu and his fellow Old Ones for the time when ‚Äúthe stars were right‚Äù.

The hipster folk of Seattle and Portland display a twisted and obscene beauty that is ultimately suicidal.  It‚Äôs sad.    It‚Äôs like watching a loved one who is a talented artist descend into debased madness.
That said, I must say that I have great memories of Hawthorne Boulevard in the 90s.  Mount Tabor is a treasure.

                        I‚Äôm not from here but from Baltimore in fact, you know, Zman‚Äôs favorite place in the whole multiverse. I have to say that, having lived in both places, I‚Äôve learned that not all ‚Äúliberals‚Äù are alike. Baltimore, once you get away from the ghetto at least, was always a far more normal place. Even the libs I remember were mostly just trade union socialists. Of course that was long ago too. As for Portland, I came here in 06 and am trying to leave. I‚Äôve watched as rents soared and the seemingly harmless old hippies have been replaced by these youthful abominations who wear their ‚Äúgender fluidity‚Äù on their sleeve and always seem to be searching your face when they meet you. They want that creepy smile, that wink, that thumbs up. They crave, no DEMAND, your approval. My only act of rebellion is my stoic expression and insistence on keeping the topic grounded in business reality. Well I do sometimes wear camo pants and other ‚Äúredneck‚Äù gear too. So far none of the snowflakes has complained about my ‚Äúmilitaristic‚Äù attire or called me a Nazi, at least not to my face.

                        Speed it up, brother. Be careful of the California flood to Boise and spilling over up into the panhandle. Also, lefty enviro mountain biking bouldering types have taken over Moab Utah, growing in number in St. Geoge and spilling all over. Many small western towns taken over by new action lefty back to the land-ers, bakery owners, Michael Pollen types from Berkeley/Orinda hills with money, and they bring their ferocious politics with them, i.e. Ashland and Medford, Oregon gone down the hole.

                        Choosing to live in the west in a mostly Mormon culture (parts of parts of Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Northern Nevada) has it‚Äôs benefits. My subdivision of 1/2 acre to 2 acre plots does not have trash all around, no one dumping their crapped up old car on the roadside, no fights and mayhem in the street (Ha!‚Äìexcept my Mormon neighbors from California..they were lefty dysfunctional Californians first, Mormons second‚Äìkeep that in mind.

                Same here but there is no way I could afford a nice zip code so I live among the Mexers.  Luckily they forced out the stone age rage apes so the quality of life is a bit better.  The Mexers think I‚Äôm into illegal gambling because of fighting roosters I keep as pets and it helps that I look Central Asian/Slavic and tans real easy.I‚Äôll probably move in a year of so.  But I‚Äôm not a millionaire and cannot afford  to live in a white community so it limits my choices to shit holes.  I‚Äôd still be stuck living among  Muzzies, Mexers or rage apes.  Maybe I‚Äôll try Lone Pine. in the Owens Valley.And the problem is, is that running has caused whites nothing but problems. We let a bunch of degenerates and moochers run us out of our cities and even states.  F**k that. shit. It‚Äôs why I despise most whites. Our flag should the whiter rabbit on a spit and why we will probably lose any fight with the empire.

Because that‚Äôs what California will be, a turncoat, marginally functioning Vichy America.  It is going to be interesting around here.  This is my home, it is what I know.  YOLO anyway, and I am largely done.  Some things can be done from other vantage points, but you need some people imbedded in enemy territory as well.  So I have made preps.

Places to go, lots of ways to get there, multiple vehicles, the fuel tanks always topped up.A couple of hours from the big city, nothing but unspoiled mountains in the distance in every direction, here on my hilltop it is brush clearing season, cut for a couple of hours at a time, then take a break and visit the Z.

                                We meet at the 79 and 371 intersection, Riverside County, out the Temecula to Warner Springs stretch.  It‚Äôs a bit of a ways from there, but there are locked gates and occasional patrols and such along the way (not as intense as it sounds, but people around here have certain expectations of others).  My tastes are expensive, but Jack will do ‚Äòer nicely.  Give me a week or so lead time, I live multiple places and am always up to various things, so would need to clear the calendar.

Each time I visit the family, either something really ugly happens to me, or I see really weird crazy dangerous people who look like they stepped aside and something wretched stepped in. And car with Utah plates‚Ä¶well, had a problem one time with just that. More and more ask basic daughter to meet me in Reno so I can avoid CA.The invite holds true for you to visit back here in Central Utah.

                                Don‚Äôt blame you, it is crazy out here.  But the good people lay low.  They don‚Äôt trust outsiders at all, and you‚Äôve got to be brought in the door by locals, or you are on your own (which fits exactly with what Lineman talks about).  The level of trust is pretty low, and I am always reminded of how ‚ÄúMad Max‚Äù driving can be around here, when I get out to other states.  I worked a good part of my life figuring out how to make it work for me out here, using a lot of local knowledge.  I think I‚Äôve got it wired for me, but it is likely an acquired taste.  Comfort in being a loner makes it easier for me.

                                    Good guess. Make me laugh!  Have missed the pawn shop. Missing part of a girl gene as my husband is better at bargain shopping than me. Not part of my makeup. Make a list and go is my motto. Have stopped for the time being attending the Shakespeare festival as have gone all, what‚Äôs the right word, POZ don‚Äôt wish to see Othello played by a gay Asian tranny guy with a lisp, or some big butchie woman. The Festival has gone all Ashland. Too many festivals, SUU and art museums/artists have changed to cultural left. Locally, the herds of sheep on the edge of town keep us balanced until they go Far From the Madding Crowd and over the cliff. Demographics changing.

I saw Othello there in the 2000‚Äôs and it was true to Shakespeare‚Äôs original vision, not Shlomo‚Äôs.

Also, often the setting has nothing to do with how the Bard wrote‚Ä¶like Hamlet in an old west setting, and goofy edgy costumes. All gone. Occasionally they keep to tradition, but you‚Äôd better read up on the production or you may get a nasty surprise.

                    All of the jokes about California being too pozzed to save aside, it‚Äôs tragic what we‚Äôve lost.From the post war period to the late 80s it was whitetopia.  All of the great beach towns, bohemian art colonies, beautiful winding country roads through the hilly interior, great cities that were clean, fairly safe and vibrant in the pleasurable sense of that word.National Parks, amusement parks, attractions of all kinds with appeal to all kinds of people.  Opportunity at every turn, affordable,  friendly and open (most people were from elsewhere so most were more open and friendly in a sincere attempt to forge bonds and communities).And now in a few short decades it‚Äôs all but gone.  Unless you‚Äôre old enough you can‚Äôt really comprehend what‚Äôs been lost. The few nice places left will eventually decay like the rest of it.We joke but this loss was no joke.

        It is virtually impossible to limit the State as long as we enable the myth of egalitarian diversity. We are not the same we are not equal they are not like us. When we as a people allow the State to go beyond its enumerated powers legitimate purpose becomes a moving goalpost. The Federal Government in example operates outside its constitutional authority infinitum. Leftists are parasitic ticks that should never be permitted to attach themselves to anything, especially the State. Making America White Again is a good start. Keeping America Free from leftist ideologies will be easier when we become White again. Whether or not our divorce is meant to be a peaceful one remains to be seen.

            JMDGT, those that contribute to the State should have a say in State affairs‚Äîperhaps even in proportion to their contribution.  That‚Äôs the basic concept of earned suffrage from another subversive we sometimes bash, Heinlein.I admit, I have no idea how to revert to such once lost, but such was the Founders‚Äô intent.  If earned suffrage was in effect, I suspect a lot of the evils of the voting public would go away.  Making America White is just a proxy for producing a better class of decision makers at the ballot box.  But it may not work there either given the indoctrination of all our students after 12 or 16 years of public (mis)Education.

                One of the biggest battles I see ahead for those of us on the dissident right is the State and its relationship to the people. Being white has always meant more than being Caucasian. As appealing as the ethnostate is I‚Äôm not sure it would solve the majority of issues we face culturally. There are plenty of left thinking progressive White/Caucasian idiots out there and they should have no say in affairs of the State regardless of contribution. A cultural of like minded intelligent realists regardless of their actual race may be the better ideal. Doing away with government schools will go a long way in preparing our children for the battles we face in the future. Make the parents responsible for their children‚Äôs education. When it comes to funding the State, everyone contributes no exceptions. If we keep the State in check we can nurture and protect our culture without the boat anchor of diversity around our necks. Get rid of the welfare State first. Limit the existing State to its enumerated powers without a nuance interpretation of what it is responsible for. In my humble opinion.

            What you‚Äôre basically proposing is a return to the classic Cold War standard of capitalist is versus commies. What schlock. MAWA is indeed the most important, if utopian, goal and there I agree, but capitalism is a piss-poor avenue to achieve your ethnostate.

        Yes, this is accurate. And now, knowing this, you must use this information to make predictions about the future. Hint, the political class is deteriorating rapidly right before our eyes. Look at the members of Congress (nearly a third are outright loons or hate this country). Rise of tyranny is inevitable because government is a living thing, and it will do whatever is necessary in order to survive (think Stalin or Mao, and yes it can happen here). Predict and prepare, there is nowhere to run or hide.

        Z, excellent work, as per usual. The bulkhead between distrust and cynicism has a necessarily high and long step. As you say, once through, there‚Äôs no going back.

        Interesting.Though it may it be a bit of a stretch to say ‚Äúpopulist‚Äù is code for white, though in some cases it doubtless is, but it‚Äôs not just about white: rather, white, male, and working class.But a lot of white collar whites gravitated to Trump, too, but these aren‚Äôt the kinds of white people the elites are trying to portray as populists. And remember, the percentage of Hispanics voting Republican actually increased with Trump as the candidate. It seems there‚Äôs a notable number of Hispanics who have had just about enough of illegal immigration, too.The difference is that Hispanic Trump voters won‚Äôt be publicly shamed, or lumped as ‚Äúdeplorables‚Äù. The term ‚Äúdeplorables‚Äù was meant to intimidate non-white male, blue collar whites, by insinuating that they would be socially ostracized if they did not tow the mainstream line.‚ÄúVote for Trump, and Hollywood hates you!‚Äù ‚ÄúVote for Trump, and your Oprah-watching wife will be ruined and be forced to divorce you!‚Äù ‚ÄúVote for Trump and you will be excommunicated from the office water cooler!‚Äù Etc.

            Being white is a frame of mind as well as a skin color.  We whites have historically completely overestimated the capacity for non-whites to adopt the white frame of mind.  Tribal and cultural preferences, over time, win out almost every time.  ‚ÄúMaking the world safe for democracy‚Äù is a good shorthand for all of this delusional thinking.

        The first 2 paragraphs on state violence being used to impose order‚Ä¶I agree that is cannot be the only glue to hold the country together, however, I‚Äôve observed a tremendous ramp-up of the violence that the state is willing to use during the my life.Cops now dressed like soldiers who reach for firearms as a first, not last resort.  No-knock raids, ‚Äúred-flag‚Äù gun seizures where gun owners lose their Constitutional rights based on hearsay‚Ä¶ the mask is really dropping on state-violence.Probably a tactic to keep ‚Äúpopulism‚Äù under control while whitey is replaced, but it‚Äôs gaining steam.

        As the inveterate blackpiller per Kevin Michael Grace, it looks like Pelosi is conceding on impeachment.

        ‚ÄúThe authority of the ruling class will no longer be based in their legitimacy to rule, but their control of the monopoly of violence.‚Äù‚Äî Democracy is more about brandishing perceived power than actual state assertion of power.  Democracy is about picking random people out of thousands for prosecution, it‚Äôs not very good at corralling thousands of people during uprisings.  The reaction of democracies to uprisings is generally half-assed, with appeals to calm, as politicians fear some Kent State like incident, with special committees and blowback.Hence the emergency button called ‚Äúmartial law‚Äù where an instant dictatorship would be formed.  I can envision an extended ‚Äúemergency period‚Äù in which martial law is ongoing for months on-end.

            I‚Äôve been hearing about martial law since I read patriotard sites back in ‚Äô08. I cannot figure out how the US government is going to effectively control 3.8 million square miles and 350 million people with a few million men.  I don‚Äôt think martial law is possible outside of cities.  The most they could do is monitor online activities and kick in the occasional door.

One idiot from Africa with Ebola could create a panic condition in the cities and while vaccinated troops could be used to maintain order,  if they are willing, good luck keeping the supply chains open for longThe US is both amazingly robust and incredibly fragile which should scare any sane personAlso note the Right is really poor at organizing and as such could be suppressed pretty easily.  On average tougher and better trained than the Left many and many Right Wingers have  military or at least martial experience but unless able to operate as a unit, even a small one are  easily crushed by MS13 or Crips and even easier by military unitsIts like this, you have to sleep, your family has to sleep.

        ‚ÄúThe divorce is inevitable.‚Äù
As long as this fantasy exists we will never accomplish anything. It is as bad as the gun consumers who believe that buying a gun means they are free and don‚Äôt have to fight back against the left‚Äôs onward match through the country. Only a tiny minority of Whites get how bad things are going to be. It will be generations before uni educated whites are forced to acknowledge the problem instead of collaborating with the enemy. By then it will be too late even if they want to divorce.

        ‚Äú‚Ä¶..When Trump‚Äôs agenda fails, as it sure[ly] will,‚Ä¶..‚ÄùZ, do you not think that enough of Trump‚Äôs agenda will succeed to avoid tipping the scales all the way to cynicism on the part of whites? While there are a number of contributors, immigration control will be the mass that determines scale position.And, your take is that should such cynicism develop it will be‚Äú‚Ä¶.an old married couple hanging on until the kids are grown‚Äù then divorcing.Do you really think it will be that civilized? I think there may be exacerbating factors; if Trump fails, much, if not most, of the responsibility will lie in the actions taken by the operating structure outside Trump (this assumes the majority of Trump‚Äôs agenda and actions are ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù on their own and not unsuccessful on their own; since we‚Äôve seem only a limited amount of them there‚Äôs some uncertainty) and I‚Äôd expect some amount of cynicism, if not most, to be directed against other institutions. The precise recipient of extreme cynicism, however, will probably be irrelevant.

            Whether Trump‚Äôs agenda succeeds or fails, people are getting good and hard a lesson about who runs the country and how they go about it.
What, if anything, people do with what they‚Äôve found out is up to them.

No, that‚Äôs not ‚Äúthe implication‚Äù
Libertarians have long promoted the spontaneous order which naturally arises in society, at least  those in the West.,

                    This is fairly typical of libertarians. They like the goal post on roller skates act. When libertarians say the ‚Äúthe state is the monopoly of violence‚Äù they are clearly implying it exists because it has a monopoly of violence. When this is pointed out, the goal posts are pushed over to some argument made forty years ago about spontaneous order. If I write a post about the absurdity of that argument, the goal posts get pushed over to the other side and I get posts about the monopoly of violence.Either way, this is not a post about that retarded religion called libertarianism.

                        I was a libertarian for a long, long time. One day it finally dawned on me why it was conceptually broken.‚ÄúFree society‚Äù is an oxymoron. The most fundamental bargain required for society to exist at all is the exchange of some degree of autonomy for the benefits of being a member of the collective. Now, where to draw the line between the claims of the collective and the rights of the individual is a legitimate argument, with a broad range of possible answers, but the point is, the claims of the collective are indeed valid and necessary for any society to exist at all.The libertarian wants to have it both ways. He wants to claim the benefits of membership in society while denying its claims on his autonomy.To be free is dead easy. Get yourself a cabin in the woods, and you‚Äôre free to do any damn thing you like.But that is not what the libertarian wants. He wants to be a participating member of society, and accrue its benefits while shedding any responsibility for contributing to its maintenance. Notice that there are few libertarians living in cabins in the woods.No, the libertarian‚Äôs argument is directed at exactly the collective whose authority he denies. If participating in political activity isn‚Äôt collectivist, what would be? Politics is by definition an appeal to the collective (especially in a democracy). If you don‚Äôt recognize the authority of the collective, why are you appealing to it?Indeed, the mobile goal posts, even more than the NAP, are probably the most essential feature of libertarianism.

                                Libertarianism has always seemed to me a refuge for the damaged.   We didn‚Äôt have the word ‚Äúsperg‚Äù back in the 60‚Äôs but at my progressive school there were a number of Ayn Fans and their most common characteristics seemed to be their dorkiness, fear of girls, poor personal hygiene and general unwholesomeness.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, they were generally quite bright and a number made a lot of money later in life.  But no one thought they were happy.
Not sure if the Libertarianism was a cause or a symptom.

                        People tend to glom onto the words of the opponents that are the easiest to ridicule. For example, when criticizing views of White Nationalists or race realists, it‚Äôs a piece of cake to find some neo-nazi and pretend his statements are representative of all WNs. Not true, not fair, but certainly commonplace.Zman does this to some extent by defining libertarians as only the left libertarians (aka, socialists) and moving anarcho-capitalists and fellow travelers into some alt-right category. Then, as many comments show, it‚Äôs easy to deride Libertarians as too idealistic, or goalpost moving, when what‚Äôs happening is either one is debunking the least defensible position, or, more frequently, selectively citing positions some subset of Libertarians as being representative of all Libertarians.

                    It seems to me that the second paragraph is obviously true. I would amend it only in that the prisoners form their own governing associations, the gangs, and they cooperate with the guards as long as the gangs are permitted to govern their members. This is all tacitly and mutually agreed to by prisoners and guards.

                            DLS, my sentiment exactly.  What else can he do?  What my fear is, albeit not from this group, is that Trump begins to be blamed personally for not stopping the flow of illegals.  That would imply to the normies that the IA flow *could* be stopped had we only elected the ‚Äúright‚Äù person in 2016.  And of course, the solution is to go back to the ballot box for the right candidate in 2020, or 2024, or‚Ä¶you get the picture.What Trump will go down in history for, if nothing else, is that he was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back wrt the fallacy of the civnats and democratic rule by the people.  Really, I believe it‚Äôs all downhill from here, albeit the road will be long.

                                Longbow, the military have been neutered by Congress.  We can send the entire US armed forces to the border, but once a Central American illegal touches US soil, he has to be delivered to a border station and held or released until he gets a court date.  Congress could stop the invasion cold by repealing this law, which was signed by GW Bush.  Further proof he was an awful president.

                        Yeah, the prisoner example is really no different from the Government example following.  Prisons require cooperation to minimize force/resources needed to control the prison/prisoners, but when the system gets out of balance, the overwhelming force of the State is applied (think Attica) and the prisoners are killed‚Äîat least until the old order is regained.  There are even more horrendous examples of such in Latin America prisons where hundreds are killed by the Army that literally lays siege to the prison.
So the question is, what form does the rebellion take when the normie prisoners in America say, ‚Äúenough‚Äù?

                        Yes, but the question is, ‚Äúhow is this fundamentally different from the following paragraphs describing the civic process of maintaining order and cooperation?‚Äù  I‚Äôd say, not different.  That is to say, a distinction without a difference.
In the end, the State always maintains the threat (right?) of violence‚Äîassuming they retain control of those forces needed to enact such.  Luckily, those forces sometimes figure it out sooner than later and conclude it‚Äôs better to dump the existing government and side with the people.

                    I too am a long time reader and (now) first time poster. The second paragraph is 100% accurate. Having worked in corrections for years, I can unequivocally confirm this. The instant more than a small handful of inmates decide they don‚Äôt want to follow the program it turns into a stalemate at best, and a full blown riot at worst. Negotiators are called in, tactical teams put on standby, off duty officers called in etc.. If the inmates decided to do this on a regular basis, prisons/jails as we know them would not be feasible.

                        Got stuck in a horrendous traffic jam headed to JFK in Lyft driven by a retired NYC Corrections officer who worked Rikers his entire career.  We had a lot of time to talk about his former job.  One thing he told me that his decision to get out and retire was driven by the younger inmates, particularly the illegals who refused to acknowledge the ‚Äúrules‚Äù.  Said it made the job miserable.

                        Just search YT on prisons and prisoners.  There are at least two or three channels by ex-cons that elaborate on their experiences in the prison system.  One is even English and has had English ex-cons on to elaborate on differences between the two countries.
That there is cooperation of a sort between inmates and their keepers does not negate the underlying threat of forced behavior through violence by the State‚Äîalbeit, the State is not beyond using the gangs as enforcers from time to time of the order they require.

                So you think Alexis de Toucqueville was wrong?‚Äù Americans of all ages, all stations of life, and all types of disposition are forever forming associations. In democratic countries knowledge of how to combine is the mother of all other forms of knowledge; on its progress depends that of all the others.‚ÄùAlexis de Tocqueville‚ÄúThe more government takes the place of associations, the more will individuals lose the idea of forming associations and need the government to come to their help. That is a vicious circle of cause and effect.‚ÄùAlexis de TocquevilleI assume you think he was wrong about the Russians, and their posterity of course, too?‚Äù The American relies upon his personal interest to accomplish his ends and gives free scope to the unguided exertions and common sense of the people.The Russian centers all his authority of society in a single arm. The principal instrument of the former is freedom; of the latter, servitude.Their starting point is different and their courses are not the same‚ÄùAlexis de Tocqueville

                Federalist, exactly.  Z-man has decidedly allowed a fringe group to live rent free inside his head.

                        Exile, for me anyway, it‚Äôs the point of the negativity and diversion/distraction from a positive message and teaching point.In the present example, the entire mention of Libertarianism could have been excluded and the message not affected.  That we continue to be lectured on the evils of ‚ÄúLibertarian‚Äù philosophy begins to make me a bit suspicious of the messenger.It is cultish in nature for a group to obsessively dwell on the evils and wrong thinking of other groups.  Smacks of insecurity and a squashing of ‚Äúwrong think‚Äù.  As has been pointed out, Libertarian philosophy is not monolithic in nature.  It is part of many of our backgrounds, but all have moved on‚Äîexcept perhaps Z-man.  ;-(

                        Exile;Agree.  It‚Äôs at least as important to understand why Libertarianism is wrong as it is to understand why Marxism is wrong.  What‚Äôs needed right now is a (semi) coherent body of thought about why anybody should align against the feckless Cloud-Folk.*Interestingly, IMHO, both ideologies share a common delusion as to the nature of humankind.  Both seem to assume that humans are inherently good but for the current institutional arrangements and, more arrogantly, that their programs can correct this situation._______________________* I know, I know, one ought not let the ideal be the enemy of the ‚Äògood enough‚Äô.  But we still need to get to ‚Äògood enough‚Äô.

                            The simple way to correct the whole thing is to understand that both libertarianism and socialism can be helpful critiques of society, but they cannot be actual models of society.  They are a spoonful of cod liver oil, not the whole damn cod.  Rock out to ‚Äú2112‚Äù when you‚Äôre a 13-year-old, then move the hell on.  Even Geddy Lee is far less grating on the ears than Ayn bloody Rand.It‚Äôs the same way that both Nietzsche and Freud can be read as very interesting criticism, but Nietzsche is not positive philosophy, and Freud is not actual science.   It‚Äôs all fun and games in ‚ÄúBeyond Good and Evil,‚Äù but Kids, Do Not Try This At Home.  As TS Eliot once said, A poet doesn‚Äôt have to be right, he just has to be interesting.

                                Postcard, interesting point.  But should we mire down the explanation/creation of a dissident right philosophy with the fine points of how it is not Libertarianism, or Socialism, or Civnat, or  whatever.
In other words, do we define ourselves by elaborating on what we are not, or do we concentrate on defining what we are.  Fine points are necessary, but perhaps beyond the average normie one wishes to convert to the cause.

                    Libertarian thought has noticeable influence on how the right sees American History.  With the BOR having some distinct negative rights influences and libertarians acting like they invented the negative rights concept.  However much cannot, and getting the right to understand the founders had a more well rounded philosophy than ‚Äúnegative rights= government‚Äù is an obstacle.Plus the founders didn‚Äôt see their government as something universal, but a workable framework for European descendants. Libertarians pretend the Constitution can work no matter the population demographics. Mostly because despite being smart enough to recognize racial differences they are too cowardly to admit them. Therefore they continue to push an unworkable plan.

                    Compsci,I was responding to the first comment where bilejones wanted us to read some libertarian scripture.
Zman‚Äôs post mentioned libertarianism in passing in discussing how the state maintains its power through more than just violence. The problem isn‚Äôt Zman, it‚Äôs the libertarians who rush to renounce the heretic.

                        Noted.  Not sure I or most others intended to ‚Äúdefend‚Äù Libertarianism or renounce a heretic.  Indeed, I heard most people‚Äîincluding myself‚Äîstate more or less that Libertarianism is a thing of the past, a dying philosophy, certainly not worth organizing a dissident rightest movement around.  Some concepts may be worth taking note of, but as a framework to rework a new society, it is insufficient.
Libertarianism *is* a good example however, of a philosophy that *could not withstand* the demographic changes we are now encountering.  What worked in 1976 White American society often falls short in 2019 Vibrant American society.

            Help me out here. What are some real world examples of spontaneous order naturally arises in a society for a prolonged period of time. I‚Äôm not talking about people getting together after a disaster, which does happen. I‚Äôm talking a situation where decade after decade a society exists with almost no government relying instead on spontaneous order when needed, i.e. to build a road or hospital or various infrastructure.Even the American West quickly saw the arrival of government for things like approval of railroad routes. What I‚Äôm asking is when has there ever been a functioning libertarian society, especially in the modern world?Also, what‚Äôs to stop a spontaneous order from becoming a coercive order? The prison gangs are a good example. They likely naturally arose to fill a need (protection) but once established continued to hold on to power and imposed their order on new inmates.In addition, how does Libertarianism defend a society against tribal people? Libertarianism doesn‚Äôt seem to jibe with HBD, but I‚Äôm willing be shown different.

                Correct.  So why bring it up? There are no die hard Libertarians here.  We‚Äôve moved on.  See what I mean?  We are arguing fine points about a philosophy we no longer believe in and is arguably in decline, rather than a discussion about the meaning and intent of 90% of what Z-man has astutely observed and wrote down for today‚Äôs lesson!

            bilejones, I haven‚Äôt read the article you cite, which may be quite good.  However, even assuming that spontaneous order does arise, doesn‚Äôt the character of that order depend greatly on the actual people being spontaneous?  I don‚Äôt want to experience the ‚Äúspontaneous order‚Äù of a black or brown society.
You do include the ‚Äúat least those in the West‚Äù qualifier.  Doesn‚Äôt the need for this qualifier demonstrate that WN should be your highest political goal and that libertarianism should an issue to be debated after the establishment of an ethnostate?

            The essay you cite does not help your case. It‚Äôs a mess of different viewpoints, many incompatible or even contradictory. Tucker, Spencer, Menger, Molinari and the Scholastics simply do not belong in the same essay.
That said, the second paragraph is pure bunk. It requires not consent, but compliance. If a woman spreads her legs because she thinks her rapist will let her live if she does is not consenting, merely complying.

            Libertarians are well intended morons which I can deal with . I‚Äôve read the big boys and heck  grew up on Robert Ringer and L. Neil StephensonIts a stupid ideology that is unrealistic but everyone needs a hobby right?Its when they try to hijack the Dissident Right which in an authoritarian Right movement by the way, then I get pissed off.Libertarians are things of the Left, basically just Democrats with unlimited corporate tyrannyIn any case there is no such thing as spontaneous order in any human society anywhere of  any race other than maybe immediate family or a small tribe. MaybeAll human order beyond that flows from force, the more righteous the authority, the less force needed.The closest thing to a Libertarian society could have been argued to have been Victorian England but its was far from Libertarian , had many laws as did Medieval Iceland and the downstream effects of poverty and dysfunction on the commons  were terrible in both casesPeople went with Leftism as much as it sucks because well contained   it  also worksTHis for example is why most people in the UK don‚Äôt want to abolish the NHS but fix itI‚Äôll grant the the Libertarians  a bit of slack on the issue of small arms, quite a few people want limits on  weapon laws even in the UK  but nobody other than a few spergy middle class White boys wants what Libertarians are sellingWhen we do get  bits of it like we do with porn, divorce on demand  and legal dope, the results aren‚Äôt good.So please Libertarians, go away and find some other people to hang with. This isn‚Äôt your movement.

            bilejones and friends.  You suffer under a delusion about human nature.  Not only that, but you are historically ignorant. Those on the secular side call it evolution and the survival of the fittest. Christians call it the fallen human nature of man. That is why societies without a strong central figure OR shared ideology are incredibly violent and corrupt. Unbridled human nature does not result in the spontaneous generation of peaceful, prosperous, ordered societies.
