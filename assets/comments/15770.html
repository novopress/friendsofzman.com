        Back in 1975, when I was an infant, my parents took me to the pediatrician, a very nice man named Dr. Rosenbaum.  He made sure all my vaccinations were up to date, then gave me one additional injection at the base of my neck, promising it was completely harmless.  Shortly after that, there was this large swelling at the base of my neck, which I was told was also harmless.By the mid-80s, the swelling had grown into a large, melon-sized tumor, but again the doctors told me it was harmless.  By the mid-90s, the tumor had transformed into an actual second human head, which spent all its time growling at me and telling me I was evil.  By 2015 or so, the other head had grown its own arm, which it uses to constantly punch me in the face, while endlessly  screaming at me and telling me I have no right to be in my body, that my body really belongs to the Other Head, has always belonged to the Other Head, and that I am pure evil merely for being here.You get the idea.  In 1975 the population of America was roughly 160 million people, nearly all of whom were, well, Americans.  In less than half of one lifetime we have grown an entire second country grafted on to the first.  And the new country has absolutely no memory or attachment to the historical reality of the first country.  It has no connection to America whatsoever: not historical, not cultural, not religious, not racial or ethnic, not linguistic, not ideological, not sentimental, none of it, zip, nada.  Americans are a defeated, occupied people.  Donald Trump promised the Great Escape, but all he delivered was Steve McQueen doing a few stunts on a motorcycle before getting shot.Trump will lose in 2020, and once the Khmer Rouge take power, they will seal all the exits and all the air ducts, and make sure they never, ever, ever relinquish power ever again.  There will be no living with these people.But that’s not the end of the story, the next chapter is called Divorce and Partition.  160 million people cannot be kept on a short leash forever.  Start thinking about that aspect in practical, reality-based, logistical terms.

            I’m with Z Man on his view on this. The Left doesn’t have what it takes to physically force a change. They’ll de-platform and remove banking access, but that’s about as far as they can take it. The challenge will be to convince a large swath of America that this isn’t okay and that they should do something about it.

                Z is dead wrong on the physical part. The Left just needs to hire the peeps to enforce their will.  It’s not hard. Just hand out badges and guns to a bunch of ethnics and Bernie Bro whites and there is your army of enforcers.Thing is,never ever underestimate what a pack of low IQ fanatics will do once in power. Furthermore the Left never goes for half-measures when they can go all the way. De=platforming and loss of banking/credit privileges  are just  for starters.Wait until you see what they do to gun owners which will be #1 on the agenda.  They will force confiscation by making every white gun owner a felon if they fail to turn in their guns.And they will make examples out of select white gun owners. These men will either end up shot dead by the cops or put in prison. There will be lots of them.In a short period of time we will be disarmed and ready for the boxcars and execution pits.

What I’d like to see develop in the USA, even at the initially-expected small scale, is the equivalent of Sinn Fein.  That is, a legal and above-ground political party which maintains plausibly deniable contacts with elements which are decidedly underground.  Where things go from there, time will tell.

                            The IRA were difficult for the Brits because the Brits showed restraint. The people opposing an American equivalent know they are morally supreme and  therefore will be under no such limitations.Also Irish nationalism is seen as a left wing nationalism so could get away with things US nationalism cannot.

                                This is true but the US is far better armed, much larger and has more veterans with modern urban warfare skillsWe have millions of Armalite Rifles , tons of explosives and upwards of a trillion rounds of ammo to useIts also much easier to take the fight to the enemy, a tactic that once the IRA was able to manage worked quite well for them.And while they did not win per se they did well enough to count as a  plus in their column.Truth is if the Right was organized and willing to pay the price they probably  could annihilate the Left root and branch and make the US basically White and Right .Not in a direct fight mind but my leveraging the brittle system and by being nasty enoughThey aren’t simply because large chunks of the  Right is utterly terrified of cooperation outside of State organization like police or military and has no idea how to actually rule or worse  any desire too.Many are still afraid of what the neighbors thing and weakened by a moral system that is uselessIts also not easy with infiltrators and such of course but it can be done.To win a fight you need the drive to dominate not to cuck and run.The hellish irony is the Left does  have goals even in its Nazi strain you get a lot more “We want this stuff” from people like the Northwest Front than any Conservative group.They don’t have the power but unlike most Republicans the Nazis  could run a functional if unpleasant societyThe trick is what do YOU want enough to sacrifice everything for .I suspect nothing and that is why the Right loses, too noble to mole in,  no will to fightHowever if the the Right dumps the loser mindset and understand that boots on necks are not options but mandatory and  goes authoritarian Right they’ve got a superb chance of winning .Eventually they can have the Republic back

                    Here’s a blueprint on how they’ll do it. Virginia AG introduced a bill to fight “hate crime.” It allows the AG’s office to identify hate crimes and target hate groups.
In addition, anyone convicted of a hate crime can no longer own a gun.
Granted, this legislation won’t pass at the moment, but, in time, as Virginia becomes minority white, the state will pass something similar. They will restrict gun ownership in any and every way possible and target white gunowners.
It will happen.

                        Useless, the State will happily starve you  to death because you once had a gun or were insufficiently cooperative with your own displacement or disarmamentYou need to be organized with others, able to run counter subversion on your own group and willing to fight till you win or they’ll pick you to death with one law after anotherYou can’t run, you can’t hide and they’ll gladly move thousands or Africans or Arabs or Mexicans into your White village to replace you and make you pay for itRight now though is the time to prepare and to make a last effort to fix this with elections. The later will probably fail but we do have to try so it it comes to atrocity and it will, we can say “Hey we tried.”TL;DR running and hiding won’t help, though its not quite time get ready to fight in an organized way till you win because the other guys want you dead or enslaved

                Banking access is such a colossal thing; however, that it alone is power enough to ruin. You simply cannot live even a working class existence without a bank account or the support of the welfare state. Attempts to build dissident communes would be the only end-run and that would be dealt with in Janet Reno style very quickly.

                    Try having a conversation with a standard issue right winger about the importance of making sure we don’t go to a purely digital only money supply (no cash) – and you’ll get all sorts of arguments about why they are sick of carrying around cash and think it would be just great if they could just carry a card around (or maybe get a chip implanted in their arm).Seriously – I come close to giving up hope when I deal with people on extremely simple shit like this – when people utterly refuse to think thru even the most simple shit – like making sure to keep using cash  – so that cash remains a viable option.If you really want to see the level of retardation among most standard issue self proclaimed right wingers – try having a conversation about taxation.

            You left out the part where the 160 million Heritage Americans were decimated by pornography, no-fault divorce, cultural Marxism, opioids, legal marijuana and video game escapism. There might only be a small handful with the health, heart and ability to fight back.

                The US fertility rate was below replacement in 1973 at replacement in 1972This is  2 and a half decades before common Internet porn, probably a decade before common no fault divorce, 3 decades before serious cultural Marxism, 4 before common Opioids or legal weed and probably 2 or 3 before seriously addictive or compelling video gamesTV was in nearly every household for a decade during the baby boom so it wasn’t the boob tube eitherThings were terrible in the 90’s people burned alive and killed but we didn’t revoltWhat’s weakened them is economic warfare since the 70’s , immigration since 1965 and the inherent flaws in our ways of thinking.Americans are ultra individualistic , obsessed with money as a value marker and burdened by an ethical code that makes actually running a society too hardIt all has to goBecome worthy, take power, use power to make you Hallmark Channel World or be a slave.

                Many of those are entirely preventable – thru your own damn choices.Nobody is gluing your hand to your dick and forcing you to watch porn.Nobody is holding you down and forcing you to smoke weed.Nobody is strapping your head to a computer screen and holding a gun to your head and forcing you to play Fallout.Even some of the other ones (cultural Marxism) – can be kept out of your direct life with minimal effort .One of the bigger problems with the current age is that we’re surrounded by idiots.  But if we’re going to call ourselves “conservative” then there must be some admission that participating in some of this shit has an element of personal choice.I like to narrow the whole thing down and call it an arm movement problem.  The simple fact of the matter is that almost all of the things you listed are entirely preventable by doing one extremely simple thing:Stop moving your goddam arms.No arm movement = no needle in your arm.No arm movement = no turning on the computer to watch the porn and tug on your dickNo arm movement = no holding the joint in your mouth.No arm movement = no working the game controller.People expend an awful lot of energy and time engaging in destructive behavior – and then want to blame the whole thing on some outside forces.Sorry- but I blame it on arm movement.Which is something the Muslims seem to have figured out – because they’ll cut them off if you keep doing stupid shit.

        I am usually the one that has to be talked away from the ledge regarding disappointment with Trump, but….1. There is no Hillary and more people are aware of her criminality than ever before.2. Immigration talk, legal and illegal, is forefront now. (too late, I know)3. Nationalist talk is not verboten now.4. The white working and middle class at least has a major defender.5. Real trade talk and action for once.6. No more glad handing commie Euro leaders anymore.7. Supreme court and Federal judges unlike any we would ever got from the other side.8. The take down or humiliation of the main news outlets, fake news turned back on them.9. Alliances with like minded eastern euro nations that the U.S. really needs.10. A stop gap in the total fall of white and normy interests and concerns.11. No major wars or interest in more neo-con adventures, and possibly the dissolution of those snakes.Now the bad. There is and never will be a wall (surprise). He still is a major Zionist and shill for Israel.Our coming economic collapse will probably be on his watch and so will the blame.Another but, hopefully he is just a gateway to a major change in how normy America and the Right start reasserting some authorityin this country. At least until President Tucker Carlson can implement our agenda and second wave push back on the Poz.For us now, start with giving out yellow vests for Christmas this year.Well I just couldn’t do another black pill Monday, sorry.

            The trouble with the “well at least he has changed the conversation” stuff is we have been down this road. Reagan changed the conversation too and was much better at it. He managed to turn “liberal” into such a epithet that liberals stopped calling themselves liberal for close to two decades. Yet, despite all the conversation changing, the steady march left continued and then accelerated once the Reagan spell wore off.Throw in the fact that three years ago I did not have to worry about being de-platformed, having my access to the banking system cut off or being sued for blasphemy.I’ve been preaching patience for a long time. It’s going to get worse, much worse, before it breaks and we have a chance to take the fight to the other side. That said, I think people have a legitimate gripe when it comes to Trump. He could be doing much better.

                    Comp;I think he’s pretty much stuck with it.  It keeps his enemies off balance, forces coverage of topics of his own choosing, etc.  He certainly would not get better treatment if he did stop tweeting.  The Progs cannot be trusted to honor even a formal truce since they see themselves as being ‘on the right side of historuy’.  Twitter dare not throw him off but would be happy to block his followers should he stop voluntarily, etc., etc.

                Back around 2011/12–ended up having lunch at a conference with Jacob Appelbaum.  Kind of a strange ranger…but most good code guys are.  But he made the call on de-platforming, spying, censorship, the whole shooting match in the conversation.  I think the only thing he missed was how gleefully private enterprises would join in–he though it would be more a function of government pressure.

                First … everything is cyclical. Everything.And the sun has *already* entered into the current Grand Solar Minimum. The governments of the world, however, conti9nue to run after the false god of Anthropogenic Global Warming. It is already too late for them to “catch up” to things as they *are.*Therefore, the droughts, catastrophic crop failures, famines, population collapses, and pandemics that *always* accompany these grand solar minima will change *everything.*Sooner rather than later, entire populations and governments are going to find themselves in a “do-or-die” situation, and ALL “surplus populations” in Western countries will be sent back. Western governments and populations will *not* choose the only other choice.Those who live and act in harmony with the truth will survive. Everybody else … not so much.Again, this IS going to happen. It has *already* started.

                    True dat, but countering the effects of a Grand Solar Minimum are relatively simple in our time. Stirring up methane hydrate fields as needed is one method. Turning back the next ice-age is quite a different matter, but that too can be done after the last SJW is hanged.

                “Throw in the fact that three years ago I did not have to worry about being de-platformed, having my access to the banking system cut off or being sued for blasphemy. ”Yep. The concerted attack of big-everything is a sight to behold. It’s one thing to get banned by Twitter; it’s another to lose any ability for people to pay you money or to shop at the grocery store or to just hold a job.With no alternative to big tech and big finance/banking, individuals can be shut down. Who needs gulags when you can simply destroy a man’s life to point where he may as well be dead. Heck, it’s actually cheaper than a whole gulag system, and you don’t have to worry about the optics.This is one area that Trump could easily have pushed back. He could have pressured big tech in any number of ways to back off the right. However, that said, it doesn’t matter because the next president and all the rest after that will be Democrats, and they will gladly let the banks, the credit card companies, the grocery stores, etc., discriminate on the basis of political views.Freedom of Association is alive and well . . . if it’s aimed at Whites with the wrong ideas.

                “He could be doing much better.”You are being too kind. Trump has betrayed his base by not only not forcefully pursuing his campaign platform but also (and maybe most importantly) by not caring about the harm being done to his voters and supporters in the press/internet/social media. One of the low points was warning Antifa not to piss off his voters or they may get violent while the FBI and Justice Department are persecuting Trump voters for fighting back.

        I had lunch with 4 normies  yesterday. friends of  40 years. one couple rush limbaugh/glen beck , one CNN. I was exercising my usual Keep it about the families talk.the cnn wife starts talking about the student loan crisis and I just couldn’t do it anymore. I went off on the whole  rigged game , the media is completely controlled, cheap labor owns the gop, globo you know who  owns the dems and ended it with the Z line ” we aren’t going to vote our way out if this” . fully expecting to get the “thats crazy”   head shaking. but to my surprise they were all just nodding . Even Mrs. CNN said she cannot believe how crazy people get when they see trump of TV .  My biggest fear is the campus crazies/Klantifa  goons they have created.   will get off the leash and innocents will be harmed.   They are full of the most dangerous thing in the world, self righteous hate. they are truly the equivalent of MAO’s Red Guard, Right down to the tacit approval from the gov. and law enforcement.

            “globo you know who owns the Dems…”
While the current meme, Globohomo, certainly has a lot of zip to it, I find that Globo-Shlomo has the virtue of greater accuracy.
Globo-homo-Shlomo would be best, but it sounds kinda clumsy.

            Whenever normie starts railing against Trump or Western civilisation, I know they are like a bored woman – they just need a good man to steer them straight. I keep it subtle, “You know… things don’t look that bad from where I’m standing…” “Well, yeah – it would be better if it weren’t for X, darn it.” Then they are mine. They only need a couple of drips of red pill though at that point. Be careful. It is dangerous juju. They go home, get angry at what they see on TV, they like what they have heard and come back from more. I soon become their their red pill pusher, giving them enough for a fix without them actually giving them much of anything. When they go red-pill, they never for a moment recall getting it from me – they did it to themselves… NEVER go full-retard straight off with Normie or Norma.  It is like trying to shove all of the peanuts down the throat of the llama in the petting zoo. Just a little, then a little more and then let them loose on the others……

        The lefties are right about one thing – something is in the air and it feels awfully much like 1939. They have been psyching themselves up and when they see that spark, they are going to jump on it and try and make a blaze of it.
Get ahead of the game. Stock up on ammo and AR15’s. They are going to need to disarm you first. The rest of the plans for you get worse from there.

            People are starting to wake up to the fact that left-wing extremity can only be countered by some pretty stiff stuff.
In Europe in 1939 there were really only the two choices, communism or fascism. There was no middle. It was just a question of who was going to win. I think our side is abandoning the middle more slowly than their side. That doesn’t bode well.

                Babe, just the point I made this morning.  When Germany was in turmoil, the choice was between two extremes.  The reasonable “middle” was forced to chose—and of course, both choices were arguably toxic in the long run.  The Germans chose a decade or so of stability and peace by empowering a group of sociopaths followed by complete and total destruction of their society, which given recent events seems to be reaching its apex through elimination/replacement of the entire German people.At least the Germans had somewhat of an excuse—having not been a united people under a democratic form of government for any length of time.  What will be our excuse?

                    Democracy is two wolves and a sheep deciding what is for dinner.A Republic is slightly better but if you allow your political class including the judicial one the slightest loophole it will turn corrupt. Its inevitable, doubly so for a nation founded on slavery, treason and worse.This is complicated by the fact that a system rigid enough to resist corruption can’t respond to actual emergencies.The tepid and stupid response to the starvation of the Great Depression beget 4 terms of Roosevelt and another forty years or so  after thatA proper system has to be rigidly nationalist, rigidly protectionist,  rigidly limited at the same time flexible enough to handle emergencies and to adapt to new technology, giant multinational corporations and worseThe US one isn’t even in the ballparkNow as to our excuse its simple, no one on our side knows how to rule men any more.By the time we get to ruling, it will require a stronger hand than we’d like and we’ll have been influenced so much by the Left that our methods will resemble there’s to a higher degree than we’d like or is healthy

                    I’m literally an Israeli on account of said Germans, but would not be so bold as to suggest that they alone, or even primarily, destroyed Germany.Incidentally, this kind of narrative is why I don’t bank on many whites getting to the other side of tomorrow. You’re not willing to accept that sometimes conflicts are inevitable and the best you can do is be on your own side. Germans, in my opinion, had about as much choice as a man in a tiger cage. Absent the ability to escape, the only way out is through the tiger. Communism at that time was immediate genocide of a lot of Germans, not just some polar opposite of fascism or nazism. Nazism was crude and antisemitic and cost my people dearly, but I wouldn’t dare suggest I would choose death for my people instead of bad times for another tribe. I do the latter daily when I enjoy IDF protection from arabs in the West Bank and Gaza.I don’t pretend it’s moral. It just is. My people are in an existential conflict and that is that. Implying peace negotiating was a choice would be farcical.

        Does Trump want immigration reform and border security, or is he talking out of his ass like so many other “conservatives”? Maybe I’m a sucker, but I believe he does. Furthermore, I think most of his supporters believe he does. He did mouth the words that shall not be spoken, that the 14th Amendment does not guarantee birthright citizenship. The question is, how much patience does the MAGA crowd have? I’m willing to wait and see how his budget battles work out.

        From the perch of ground zero–the land of Occasional-Cortex and  Jerry “the human tick” Nadler…I see no self-awareness or self-limiting in the Democrats.  As an acquaintance who still has ties to the old Democrat machine said recently…the old school Democrats are scared shitless of the new Jacobins in their midst and none will stand up to them.   There are a bunch that got themselves into the NY Assembly and Senate–and now that both are controlled by radical Democrats–and with Cuomo trying to out Mau-Mau his 2020 competition, can goddamn guarantee that is where you will see the blueprint for the rest of the country, come Jan 1.  It’s gonna get ugly.

            OK, but that might result in “old-school Democrats” running to the (R) lever in the voting booth.  There is NO question that “Reagan Democrats” pushed Trump over the top in the Upper Midwest, so that’s not impossible.

That is rare wisdom these days. Also, I gave up drudge about six months ago. It’s a good decision for me. His headlines were just anxiety-provoking. Even thinking about going to his site now gives me a little visceral shudder

                Yeah, love of celebrity is definitely a symptom of end-stage Empire. It’s hard for me to read any of the news when people talk about what ‘the way forward’ and ‘how do we get out of this mess’ because it seems really obvious to me that in a post truth world the only way to get back to the truth is for something cataclysmic to happen. People are  not just all the sudden going to go ahead and start believing there are only two genders again. The craziness we see is only go in one direction as long as we live in the world of plenty. This isn’t the first time that Humanity has been in a post truth world. But there’s always a reset and it’s generally pretty brutal.But right now I’m sitting in my comfy leather chair wrapped up in my Restoration Hardware faux fur blanket listening to the rain outside and cracking open Eric Cline’s 1177 BC, The Year Civilization Collapsed. So my life’s pretty good.

            Drudge used to be my daily first stop for years. I might get on there once a week now. I cut loose “news” outlets and opinion web pages much more quickly than I did a couple of years ago. The first to go was National Review when they fired Derbyshire. Since then I have zero patience for bullshit. It was kind of like breaking the seal on a night of drinking.

        One major problem with conservatism is that it became a political agenda when it should have been a mass cultural phenomenon instead. Forget about electing the right people; the right people do not exist — especially when the culture is a vapid wasteland. Make conservatism a lifestyle as much as it is a belief system. Convert enough people to the lifestyle and politics will take care of itself.

            Good plan. Conservatives should  have an actual path as to what society looks like and a goal to get there,Its not however some vapid brand or lifestyle choice, That the Rob Dreher money cuck run and hide approachIts about power and authority to set the rulesIf you don’t want porn in your society you imprison  or shoot porn producers , you don’t want opioids on your streets, you hang enough people so that dealing stops. Want to end cultural Marxism? sameIt will require a ruthless will and truly massive effort  but there is no other way.Collective and Ruthless punishment damn the money costs  or lose. your fight. No partial measures, do or do not.If you aren’t willing than you need to stop period and just let it die since you’ve deiced the Liberty end of the Left spectrum is more important than a healthy peopleA last thing, the Right must un-cuck itself on money issues. If people don’t have steady work at decent wages , you get no families in modernity. There are no sources of cheap social capital to bypass this that have worked anywhere on a large scale .You will pay a price for the goods and services  enough to support your neighbors and your nation, even this limits your choices, might  cut quality and or increases costsNo cheap labor, no free trade, hell as little trade as possible , a tiny FIRE sector and whatever regs are required so that working stiffs can thriveThe “liberty” option simply means an end game either collapse or Communism

        Z Man;In a way, Q (as discussed tangentially in the previous thread) is a mirror image of Drudge, Huffpost, et al’s rantings about impeachment and removal.‘Somebody up top is going to swoop in and punish all your enemies with no effort needed on your part.’But yet nothing much ever happens. Big event deadlines come and go without much change.  Hard to know which set of disappointments might trigger something kinetic.You (Z Man) bet on it’s being the Commies’ and you could well be right since it’s been repeatedly pointed out that you can’t indite a sitting president.  But as the French branch of the Cloud Folk just found out, once the preference cascade starts for some reason or other, there’s no telling where it goes.One scenario is that the derp state scumbags at DOJ SDNY really *do* indite  P. Trump.  You seem to think that they won’t because the Cloud really has bottled up most of his program.  But, in the words of the evanescent Q, they really are that stupid.  They’d see a glittering path to prominence for themselves and all of NYC would be egging them on.  We’ve already seen DOJ torpedo the China trade trade talks by arresting the Red Princess in her lair (Vancouver BC).  And just leaking news of an investigation  is evidence that Q is right, they really *are* that stupid.So how would The Cloud actually stand down DOJ SDNY_?  At that point in the scenario Pres. Trump has little choice but to fire the lot of them + Mueller and initiate wholesale purges of the derp state.  He and his are then in no small amount of personal danger.  Nixon knew he could resign in personal comfort.  Trump knows he cannot.Coups often happen when somebody capable of executing one gets put in a box with no other way out.  Death Ground in the words of Sun Tzu.

            I’ve written extensively about this topic here. This is delusional thinking. Trump can’t fire Mueller; only the Attorney General can fire him. Trump should have accepted Sessions’ resignation immediately after he recused himself from the Russia investigation. I had some hope that Matthew Whitaker was the outsider brought in by Trump to fire Mueller and end the investigation, but it’s clear that’s not going to happen. And Trump’s nominee to replace Sessions, William Barr, is a swamp creature with extensive experience in the CIA and the DoJ. He’s a GOPe company man. Mueller’s clown show of an investigation will continue unabated.Trump will likely be indicted in 2019 by the US Attorney’s office in Manhattan for campaign finance violations. (The US Attorney for SDNY in Manhattan was appointed by Jeff Sessions.) These are felony charges with the potential for jail time. Like the Mueller investigation, the indictment is BS, but it will further cripple Trump’s presidency. I won’t be surprised if Trump resigns in exchange for a full pardon for himself and his family from Pence. Soft coup completed.Trump took on the establishment but failed to install a loyal leader to keep the careerists at the DoJ under wraps, and now they’ve won. It’s game over for Trump–he’s finished. The Democrats in the House will hound him for the next two years. He’ll get no meaningful support from the Republican establishment. He’ll be indicted in 2019 and will either resign in early 2020 or will lose badly in his bid for 2020. Sessions will publish a memoir and will emerge as a sort of folk hero to the left, rather like Comey. What a shit show.

                Sounds mostly correct to me. BUT … Now that it is CLEAR to Trump–and it must be if it is clear to us–that the Bolsheviks are going after not only him but also his children, Trump might be motivated to USE the immense power in his hands to neutralize the malefactors. If THAT doesn’t do it, nothing will, and your predictions will be 100% on point.

        Trump ran for office to preserve an America in which the kind of businesses  he and  his family run, that is casinos, hotels, and assorted shady real estate deals, flim flam schools  and so forth.The fact that he does some things that benefit our side does not mean he is on our side and while he can buy us some time and shift the Overton window a bit he’s not going to save America .He can’t and its quite possible he is in way over his head and had now idea just how corrupt the system is anyway.In the end until the Right embraces power and is willing to forgo niceness in any way shape or form and rule with ruthless intent and in a collective manner  they can’t winA proper revolutionary movement would be willing to consider the demolition  of universities or maybe cities  that don’t serve the public good  a sane one probably won’t do it

        SCOTUS just turned down an appeal from states wanting to defund Planned Parenthood. Roberts and Kavanaugh voted with the liberals. Now I would rather pay for abortions than 18 or more years of welfare, schooling and prison. But so much for picking “conservative” judges. At least the anti-abortion groups can keep their fundraising gig going a little longer.

            Everyone who thinks “Well at least we got good judges,” is going to be sorely disappointed. They’re all swamp creatures who will side with the system in the end. If there are eight Republican SCROTUS justices watch four of them “grow” on the court.

            To be clear, abortion is eugenic, including in the sense that the population is kept more proportionately white:https://radixjournal.com/2016/04/2016-4-8-the-pro-life-temptation/https://radixjournal.com/2016/04/2016-4-13-unintended-consequences/I agree on having little faith in “Conservative” judges.  We also should not be hamstrung by originalism.  If the Left is going to contrive legal arguments to serve their ideology/interests, the Right must reciprocate.  Be aggressive and escalate however is necessary (and when prudent), or lose.  Oswald Spengler:“Life is a struggle involving plants, animals, and humans. It is a struggle between individuals, social classes, peoples, and nations, and it can take the form of economic, social, political, and military competition. It is a struggle for the power to make one’s will prevail, to exploit one’s advantage, or to advance one’s opinion of what is just or expedient. When other means fail, recourse will be taken time and again to the ultimate means: violence. …“Talk of world peace is heard today only among the white peoples, and not among the much more numerous colored races. This is a perilous state of affairs. When individual thinkers and idealists talk of peace, as they have done since time immemorial, the effect is always negligible. But when whole peoples become pacifistic it is a symptom of senility. Strong and unspent races are not pacifistic. To adopt such a position is to abandon the future, for the pacifist ideal is a static, terminal condition that is contrary to the basic facts of existence.”https://www.counter-currents.com/2010/06/is-world-peace-possible/

                I’ve had an epiphany:“It is clear that a foundational principle of our Founding Fathers, the craftsman of our Constitution, was a primary concern for the common well-being of the white inhabitants of these United States.  Foundational principles such as these are indelibly linked with our nation, and therefore our understanding of all laws, delegations of rights, etc. whatsoever, must be in reflection of said fundamental principles.  Our understanding of the Constitution, and all other laws, must therefore live, change along with the movements of history, so that these foundational principles remain always in application.  Therefore, I rule that, at the time of their committing x, y, and z, the defendants were in violation of no valid laws of these United States.”I think I have a winner here. | sarc.

I believe that’s actually about 16 years of welfare and schooling, followed on by 30 to 40 years of prisons and welfare.

            Interesting mention of Drudge today.  i’ve noticed in the last few months a decided turn in the news they aggregate to a distinctive negative slant on Trump.  In other words, they’ve changed their balance pro/con.  Anyone else perceive this?

                Former Drudge reader here;  your perception is IMHO accurate.  The morphing of Drudge might perhaps have been incremental; in any event, there is really nothing left now at the website that is worth clicking.
Perhaps Drudge transferred editorial control to a J-school graduate, or Drudge’s own personal affliction has dragged him down.

                M. R. V.;The only stated criteria in the Constitution for impeachment are ‘high crimes and misdemeanors’.  It is a *political* remedy available to the Legislative Branch of Govt. to check the other two branches, not a matter of criminal prosecution which are the domains of the Executive Branch or Judicial Branch.Tl:Dr: A  president can be impeached for any damned thing at all.  You just need a majority of the House.  To actually *remove* the president (or anybody else in either the Executive or Judicial Branches) you need 2/3 of the Senate.  Hate to be a black pill dude but it is important to know the true situation.

        “They toned it down a bit in the election in order to not scare the remaining whites in their coalition”LOL. Every uni educated white Democrat I meet thinks Trump is evil and stupid and that everyone who voted for Trump is a stupid bigot. If they are Hillary voters, they believe every narrative of the press including the latest lunacy about Russia. All Hillary and Bennie voters who are uni educated whites want Trump impeached. the only possible group for the Democrats to lose by being too looney is working class men. The rest of the whites gain status by embracing the lunacy du jour

Don’t worry, you’re one of the good guys, and that counts for something. Histories of the gulags usually include some of the black humor of the exterminatees, so if we keep on posting and memeing, some of our stuff will make it into future history books.

                Red pill and blue pill come from the movie The Matrix, where moebius offers Keanu Reeves two pills, the red to wake into the unpleasant actual reality, or the blue which will leave him in a pleasant computer simulation, but one devoid of real meaning.  The others are plays on these two original.  Some writer for the New Yorker did an entire article on it, but didn’t seem to know the etymology.

Neo is offered two pills: a red and a blue. The blue pill lets him stay in the simulation, the red pill will show him reality in all it’s hideousness. If you’re blue-pill, you still live on Planet Hollywood, where CNN is real news, America is the most racist country in the world and Hillary would’ve been a fantastic president.

            That would be OK except the law in the U.S. is no longer applied fairly, but rather there are degrees depending if you’re in the in-crowd or a protected class, or a dissident. Think Clinton and Comey vs. Manafort (in solitary confinement, no less!) and Flynn (life ruined). So someone acting to protect themselves out of fear for their life will be prosecuted if they are a Trump supporter. While the leftist goon doing the attack will be let off the hook. Just like we’ve been seeing for the last 2 years.

                We are not voting our way out of this and if an effective voter reform could get approved, we wouldn’t need it. The only practical measure possible at this point is to “starve the beast”. Minimize your consumption, boycott the culture, discourage anyone you can from joining the military, and minimize your taxes. If you can retire, do so immediately and draw any government benefit you can.

The president is a boob , a dope, a moron, etc.
If he’s so stupid how did he become president ?  A multi-million dollar NYC real estate mogal ?  Famous celebrity  ?
The left is in a panic , but all the can do is throw empty threats at the president. If they could have done anything they would have long ago.

        I dont know if it’s true that Trump has done ‘nothing’. The military is on the border, H-1Bs are down, he dodged the UN migration pact turd sandwich, he is making some PC taboos more debatable and this is done against the fairly intense opposition of the DS, liberal judges, the entire MSM, dem party and half of his own party. I dont know if deportations are up or illegal immigration is down. And the wall seems to be going nowhere, whether that’s b/c of funding or something else.But besides building a wall that would mostly be symbolic anyway, and ignoring fantasy ideas like declaring martial law and leading a military-back coup against the constitutional order, what exactly should he have done that he hasn’t done, given that he is a civ nat, not white heritage, patriot, asked as an honest Q?

            I just discovered that Trump’s withdrawal ftom the Paris Agreement isn’t effective until a few months before the 2020 election. I don’t know if the US has made any additional financial contributions on top of the $1 billion Obama forked over. Ironically, Obama unilaterally committed the US to the Paris Agreement via Executive Order. However Trump cannot immediately end US committment until after 4 years notice. He could “grow into the office” by then to “safeguard his legacy”.

                None of that stuff matters anyway. The Grand Solar Minimum has already started. Global cooling is underway. It will change EVERYTHING. Not this afternoon or next week, but within a very few years. By 2025, the truth will be clear to everybody.

As usual, the inversion culture is preparing us for the opposite of reality.  Worse than a mere waste of resources.

                    MRV……Yes been studying this for a while and the next Maunder Minimum is likely slowly rolling out.  This is not the time for wealth redistribution and getting rid of fossil fuels.  The belief test the overlords fail is no Rooseveltian sized WPA CCC projects have been rushed into service to raise the sea walls and build higher jetties to save us from the oceans.  They know this and don’t believe their own horseshit. Ice skating on the Themes anyone! See the old paintings from mid 1600’s.

        The Deep State torpedoed the trade agreement with China. In exchange for a trade war at least and maybe a hot one.In War, trannies gays lesbians poc etc are no substitute for White men. Meanwhile the Dems might very well wage a general war on Whites and China a two front War at the same time.One way in which the war might be waged is the Purge movies which seem a template for Hollywood. The latest CW Supergirl had advocating White women and Blacks teaming up to kill all White men and their families. Dems pick ideas from Hollywood that is their think tank seriously.The advantage for Dems is they don’t have to mobilize White men against other White men. Just enable non Whites to do whatever they want against White men and make fighting back a crime . This is the case in the U.K.Trump himself is a goner. He will be impeached and convicted by the Dems and GOPe and spend the rest of his life in prison to punish blasphemy and deter others. While picking a fight with China and White men. At the same time. Yes they are that stupid. I fully expect Congress to also remove Pence and install Hillary as her machine comprises the entire DOJ and FBI. Pence can add 2 and 2 and get 4. Hillary thinks it’s always 5.Heck the real action will be Hillary and the FBI vs Kamala and Loius Farrakhan. The latter have all the big money donors and Hollywood. The former most of the Deep state.

            More evidence in the UK of forceful opposition to the globalist agenda. EDL,Britain First seem to be more active than any comparable US orgs.UKIP is actually talking about demography as destiny.
More anti-white crime in the US than the  UK and a lot more explicitly eliminationist rhetoric as well eg “We will replace you”.
