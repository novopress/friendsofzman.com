        “To be blunt about it, if antisemitism is ever going to take hold in America it will be due to people like Michael Bloomberg“
I hope you’re right, right now America looks like nothing more than a vehicle for Jewish power fantasies.

            I was thinking last weekend that the DNC convention would come down to two crazy Jews. Not sure who will win in “Over-The-Top Jewish Oligarch vs. Unfrozen Bolshevik Caveman” but race-relations with the tribe will not be the winner.

                I’m not sure what the real end game is here, but my hunch is Bloomberg is not really interested in being president or the nominee. This looks like a philanthropic enterprise to stop Sanders. He’s buying indulgences. If he can keep Sanders from winning enough delegates to claim the nomination, then the party will pick someone who will be forever in debt to Bloomberg and his people. The anti-Zionists and anti-Globalists will be permanently sidelined.
That’s my hunch.

                    When the Mexicans have enough votes to start electing themselves, do you think it will be worse than Jews?My guess is the Jews will seem like the good old days.

                        The Jewish Good Old Days?
If what remains of the Alt Right could somehow overcome their autism and purity-spiraling, they would trying to figure out how to stoke and channel the anti-Semitic tendencies in Catholic Latinos to their advantage.

                            I think you are misunderstanding what I meant.  I meant that Mexican rule will be so much worse than Jewish rule that living under Mexican rule will make today’s Jewish rule seem like the good old days.

                            Veg, yep. If Republicans had any balls – and we know that they don’t – they would quietly but consistently note the ethnic/religious identity of Dem politicians, behind the scene operators and political donors. Not talking about bashing Jews, just note that they are Jews.
This drives Jews nuts and would rapidly increase the awareness of other Dems about who runs the show. The GOP would be roundly denounced for this, but it’d work.

                                Oddly enough the left is more redpilled on that than the right, in no small part to their muslim faction. BDS was a real thing. That would never happen on today’s right.It’s funny though. I always noticed how many Jews are running things, but it didn’t bother me until it was obvious things were going south.All the same I’ve never hated or wished Jews ill. On a personal level, I’ve liked almost every Jew I’ve met.  More so than most actually. But don’t run my country into the ground and expect me to be cool with it.  Time for new leadership.

Antisemitism a trifle by comparison.We’re all whites to them, but they are the whites who betray our lands to the Latins.2d and core FAIL; we must do our own dirty work or perish, if we don’t its a question of who destroys us and not “if”.  To empower the Latins to get rid of the Jews -who are weak in all but will – betrays fatal weakness ourselves.  We’d literally be going to Los Zetas and MS13 to handle our wifes scumbag attorney.We do our own dirty work or perish, and with total justice we should.

                        Tars,
First, Jews are heavily responsible for Hispanics and other POC becoming our overlords, so these are not the good old days.
Second, at least whites will recognize that Mexicans aren’t a part of our group, which will engender group identity in whites. In addition, unlike traitorous, shape-shifting Jews, Mexicans aren’t smart enough to trick whites into thinking their anti-white laws are good for us.

                            Nor do they care too. I’m in So Cal where around 5% of the entire US population lives and while it might not represent Kansas  lives I can tell you that antisemitism is rampant in the US as is a strong dislike for Asians especially Chinese and BlacksGenerally race relations are decent with Whites and Latinos.  The La Raza types I think mostly work with Left wing idiots and are paid by them while the day to day people just don’t care about that and mixed families while not the majority or even super common here are common enough and no one really gives a fig.Its not as good as say 100% White but its tolerable like being rich in a safe area of Latin America basically.As to the Jewish issue, between immigration and fertility rates, a lot of the Jewish community in So Cal is just gone. Most of the stores, delis and assorted things have dried up and blown away.They still have a lot of social capital though far more than would be expected,US wise between intermixing with Whites and low fertility, non Orthodox Jews in the US are  disappearing. I’m seeing a similar trend nationally as well.The leadership though is still heavily philoseimitic  . The gap between the people and its “ruling class” is hardly new though. Back in the day the two socialist options, USSR lite by Roosevelt or NDSAP lite by the American Bund, many Americans wanted the laterIts reasonable to assume that our elected and appointed and upper classes want exactly the opposite of what we do.Changing that is not simple but it can be done., The question is if you do, what do you want instead? When someone figures that out, than they can figure out how to get that and what will have to be paid.Until than or at least until most of the Boomers and to a lesser degree Gen X  are gone and Gen Y take over  the US political scene won’t change.And yes Gen Y is rather antisemitic especially its Left and unscrupulous politically.,

                        California has enough Mexicans numerically to pull this off but they’ve only managed to reach AG level so far.  The Dems have “hacienda’d” the Hispanic vote much like they “plantationed” muh Blacks.  California is still governed by pale stale frails like dead-goat-eyed Nancy and a coalition of mystery meats who conspicuously lack Squatamalenness.NuMerican Hispanics are superior Imperial farm equipment to their West African predecessors – less engaged, less inclined to rock the boat, more easily domesticated.  Blacks are being replaced along with us, having largely served their purpose as block-breakers and city-wreckers.Don’t swing your chickens before they hatch.  If Whites don’t take Shlomo down a few pegs, the next Great Gentile Hope will be the Han.

                                I’m beginning to believe that Asians and South Asians will be the key to destroying the current system. Those groups act like Jews, and a host can only handle so many parasites before it becomes sick.
Also, whites just don’t react the same to being told they’re evil and racist by Asians and Indians as Jews and blacks. As whites move closer to becoming a minority, our survival instincts will start to kick in. Combine that with being ruled over by Asians and Dot Heads whom whites feel zero guilt toward, and you get a lot more whites waking up.

                                    I’m betting more strongly on South Asians. South Asians are MUCH more prone to rules lawyering, general argumentation, obsequious sycophancy to your face (and sniping hatred behind your back), and simultaneously avoiding work while hoovering up credit personally for group projects than East Asians. Does that behavioral pattern remind you of any other group? In contrast, East Asians tend to be almost autistic by comparison.There are other problems with East Asians, but in terms of taking up leadership roles within existing organizations, SAs are the group most likely to to supplant Jews.Yes yes, NA [SA/EA] ALT, and there are those dreadful female East Asians at elite schools who make an excessive SJ nuisance of themselves, but they are exceptions and not the rule.

Agreed. It’s really the South Asians. They’re not as good as Jews, but they play the same way.
Btw, as much as I rant about Jews or South Asians, I don’t hate either group. I hate what they’re doing to my people, but I don’t hate them. They’re doing what they do. You might as well hate a tree for having leaves.

That’s one reason why I suspect Dr. Charles Lieber of Harvard passed the virus blueprints to the two PLA spies.
Either he knew how sloppy Chinese quality control is, or had help- there’s a CCP faction that is trying to take Xi down, as Xi did to Bo Xilai (former head of Intelligence Ministry).

                        Tarstarkusz, if Hispanics take over a town, I suspect it will not be as bad as with Black rule.  To see such, take any of the big cities currently desolated by Black rule.  However, the examples of Hispanic rule are not all that common.  CA will prove interesting to see how far the fall will be. But CA is at such a level, that the decline will not be immediately obvious.The city I currently live in is a example of Hispanic rule.  Deterioration is certainly evident.  Just how far the decline will go is yet to be seen, but it’s moving in the wrong direction as the population elects only those grifters with Hispanic surnames.That’s the problem, stupid is as stupid does.

                    There’s no way to be sure of Bloomberg’s intent, but the consequence has been to completely destroy the Biden campaign (which already looked to be hulled below the waterline…) Bloomberg has been going so hard, and having so much success, taking the black vote (polls only at this point, of course) that even The Onion is noticing:

            Interesting observation from Z-man.  Such is not unapparent to our Jewish population, either.  I used to competitively shoot at matches with a Jewish enthusiast (this is AZ, where strange bedfellows abound).  In those days, McCain was running around with Joe Lieberman and the rumor was that they’d go for the Presidential run as Pres and VP candidates respectively.When the discussion came up, the our Jewish gun enthusiast spoke up and said he was distraught that such should happen as it would be the worse thing for the Jewish Americans as antisemitism would explode—especially if Lieberman should step into the office of President if McCain died.At that time in my life, I thought this opinion strange.  No longer.  😉

        What has been most interesting about the ascendance of Mike Bloomberg is not that he is buying the nomination but that he seems immune to the dirty tricks like pulling out old sound clips of him saying sensible things about blacks. The only people who seem to care about this “leaked” clips are establishment BoomerCons who are collectively getting the vapors and heading for the fainting couches over his raycisst comments. None of them seem interesting in asking if Bloomberg is accurate in what he is saying, and he mostly is, but more whether or not what he is saying makes them feel sad. So much for facts not caring about your feelings. Li’l Mike is a P.O.S. but that doesn’t make it less true that minorities are responsible for almost all of the violent crime in NYC.

            More interesting is that all these accusations seem to roll off Bloomberg, just like it does Trump.  Love him or hate him, the alpha machismo protects him the same way.  That part is worrisome if he gets the nomination.  He lacks Trump’s charisma, but can make up for it in pure financial power.

                The media won’t turn on him while he’s shooting cash at them through a fire-hose.  Eventually they might depending on the nomination end-game, but for now they will take his $millions and stay quiet.

                    Yeah, from some people it does.  Especially with the internet at one’s fingertips.  Although I have noticed that certain things (articles on certain crimes)  have been scrubbed from the google crawler’s index and don’t show up on any of the search engines anymore.  I wonder if they’re on fiche at the library?

            To be fair, the cat is out of bag now, that it doesn’t hurt anyone unless you let it. Obviously Trump who shrugged off his past, but Ralph Northam, Justin Trudeau as a few examples.
Don’t apologize, don’t even acknowledge it. There’s too much news and info constantly coming down the pipe.  Just wait a cycle or two, and bam the electorate will have forgotten all about it.

                All the things that Bloomberg has said on camera in the past are meaningless.  Just engage him in the present.  He is basically nonfunctional in an unscripted, free-form environment.  Trump would absolutely destroy the man in the first five minutes of a one-on-one debate.  Which is why there will never be one, only canned “Mike” ads and highly structured and scripted “press conferences” for the guy.

                That’s because stereotypes tend to be fairly accurate – or they fade away. Stereotypes that last hundreds of years are, in fact, realistic group descriptions that should be heeded.

                    The French stereotype themselves as a martial race.
Celts in America are stereotyped as tough, brave warriors but Celts have been the whipping boys of Europe for the last 2000 years.
Sour grapes, projection,coping, etc can drive stereotyping as much as any truth. To believe all stereotypes are true is to believe that humans are fundamentally honest or rational.We’ll agree to disagree.

                        garcon,
Good points. Let’s say that negative stereotypes that won’t die generation after generation are probably fairly accurate.
For example, Japanese Americans in California used to be stereotyped as gardeners for the wealthy – a somewhat negative stereotype. Why? Because it was true. But over time, the stereotype died because it stopped being true and the Japanese community had no desire to keep it going.

                    The microsecond after the Cold War ended, when globohomo didn’t perceive the need for real Americans to defend their property from the communists anymore, they immediately began planning our ethnic cleansing. All of the horror commies have wrought in every corner of the world did not include actually ERASING any nations, much less an entire civilizational realm.These globalist vermin are orders of magnitude worse evil. I’m voting, at least in the primary, for Sanders. Drain the swamp, or burn it the reeking ashes. Globohomo doesn’t actually have a fundamental constituency. They have a supporting coalition of the fringes, each faction of which has its own interests and objectives. No one actually WANTS to be ruled by Mini-Mike and his brethren. Stupidity and complacency of our people and globohomo control of the most pervasive propaganda machine ever to exist has carried them far, but their perception management is not working anymore. They will have to supplement with other tools, or lose. Who will step up to the plate to die for the vision of the future offered by these oligarchs?

                        “Who will step up to the plate to die for the vision of the future offered by these oligarchs?”Besides minorities and sexual degenerates globohomo does actually have a core constituency, a core ethnicity if you will – the sycophantians you might call them . I used to know a lot of these types. They tend to work in media or “tech” (i.e. something with a computer that doesn’t actually require a lot of brainpower or scary math). They loves some microbrew, some weed, some crazy fruit flavored vape… Superficially they just look like particularly vapid, materialistic Reform Jews but they’re nominal Christian white people. The best one word term that I’ve seen DR people use for them is “bugmen”. It seems pretty spot-on.These are Mini-Mike’s “loyal” core voters. I have to put loyal in scare quotes because it’s hard to use that word to talk about such people otherwise. Mike wants to give them more of they already have. He will talk the DIE talk (diversity, inclusion, and equity) while making sure the hobos, blacks, and chollos stay out of their neighborhoods. On top of that, unlike the Lefty moonbats, Mike will actually push the junkies, homeless, and street shitters off the sidewalks in from of their loft apartment building. Mike means higher resale value!! Unlike Comrade Bernie he won’t even hint at taking their 401K and giving it to the poor. In short, Mike is for discrete bourgeois hedonism.Of course this is the whole problem with the globalist dream. They are actively or passively encouraging the extinction of the core white ethnies that used to keep the streets (and the world) safe for them. This is already causing problems in Europe and soon will in the US where globohomo faces down Muslims. These are people who still actually believe in something they will die for.

                            Your last two sentences are spot on.
Globhom can only exist in a post-industrial society with the world’s strongest military, reserve currency, and ludicrous excesses of material goods.
By comparison, look at how Islam thrives under the harshest, most penurious conditions on Earth. The life of the average Muslim flows with a depth of religious faith and belief that no longer exists in the West.
Long-term, if current Western trends do not reverse, my money’s on the Muslims by a country mile.

        Having lived amongst the Lefties in the extended fam lately, I picked up some nuggets of intelligence.  The current attitude is “don’t bother me with details, just get a candidate that is not Trump and I can then support him”.  This tells me they totally don’t want to deal with all of the illegal stuff that’s been going on, water under the bridge, so sorry, move on.  They also don’t want to deal with all the clowniness of their candidates, just pick a clown and then go with him.  Finally TDS is in full bloom.  They would dance at news of his assassination.In light of all of this, I am looking for a complete burning down of the Dem convention, character destruction of all of them, and as much chaos as possible, every day.  I think accelerating the crazy has its merits, here and now.Bloomberg fits all the grotesque stereotypes that must never be spoken of in polite company.  Our country isn’t polite any more, so it’s going to be epic if he sticks around.  The entire country gets to deal with the crazy rich uncle who likes to constantly rewrite his will and cut people out of it.

            That’s true. Rank and file Dems want Drumpf OUT, regardless. The rabble would be fine with Bernie, but the establishment thinks it has time to corral the rank and file into a non-Bernie camp. If Bernie wins primaries and the nom, then I think a “heart attack” will lead voters to someone else, and minimize open revolt. If you believe in conspiracies.

                Bernies going to take it. He’s the DEM version of Trump. A ton of energy in his camp and he brings out people that would never vote for another white billionaire.
He’s drawing literally 3 times the people at his crowds and the media refuses to report it.
All he has to do is point at Bloom and say “billionaire.”
Now, Trump vs. Bernie will be enjoyable. 2 complete nut jobs with “salt of the earth” bases going up against each other.

My favorite justification though was someone saying that at least Bloomberg was rich enough that he wouldn’t be beholden to “special interests”, ignoring the fact that heisthe special interest.

                Hope the same happens to the damned Girl Scouts, too.  Everywhere I go to the store these days I’m greeted by stupid Nice White Ladies and their progeny, along with all their various colored little friends, imploring me to buy their fat/sugar laden cookies – and support GloboSchlomo.  Every agenda paid for and supported by the Girl Scouts is anathema to me and mine, and ultimately wants the death of all those little White girls, too, but their mothers are too stupid to see it.

            BSA points up the idea that communism is a front to weaken rich targets for plunder.
In 1961, a clique of Belgian homosexual communists, who happened to be priests, decided to turn the RC Church.  Some 35 years later, their prize: the treasury of the Vatican.
The BSA got gay, and what happens?Lots of ambitious Lawyers On The Make begin to trawl the public records.

        To be blunt about it, if antisemitism is ever going to take hold in America it will be due to people like Michael Bloomberg. … His breathtaking lack of self-awareness could create more anti-Semites in one year than have existed in North America since the first humans cross the Bering land bridge.I believe this is precisely what will happen, and in factishappening as we speak. For all their vaunted “intelligence” I sometimes think that Jews (the powerful ones, at least) have to be some of the dumbest people on earth. Their “breathtaking lack of self-awareness” is a good way to put it, though. So kudos on that.

                    I think clannishness and self-awareness are connected. The higher the clannishness, the lower the self-awareness. I think something similar applies to belief. The more ideological, the lower the self-awareness. In Bloomberg’s case, he really is the ultimate alpha inside the Jewish culture. That’s all that matters to him, so he can’t see all the other stuff.Frankly, if Sanders was a Catholic or a woman, I don’t think Bloomberg would feel the need to spend billions to stop him. I think Sanders represents in the mind of guys like a Bloomberg, a past they have left behind. Sanders touches on the existential angst of the Jewish ruling elite in ways that gentiles cannot grasp.

                        The Jewish A/B test from ~100 years ago was communism v. Zionism. The inflection point came when the Soviets purged the Jews (Trotsky, etc.).  After that, Zionism began to replace communism as the Jewish strategy, with arguably the denouement coming when the original neo-conservatives forsook there communist priors and became, in the Z Man’s unforgettable turn of phrase, hyper-violent liberals. Sanders is a relic from the losing side, and the Zionist/globalist/capitalists want no part of him.

                        There’s no question that Bloomberg is to the modern Jew what David was to the ancient Jew.  The archetype for everything a Jew should be and strive for, while Bernie represents a time when they were mostly 1930s communists as a reaction to the 18th and 19th Century goyim that was effectively able to keep a lid on them.

        Meh.They are all products of their environments, Z. You do them a disservice; they do far more than just tick boxes – at least in the environments that spawned them.In the tribe of the Fake Indian/Chardonnay soaked wahmen – tough questions about economies and policy are not an issue and are not allowed. All that matters is Vagina. Liz’s Vaginal Holiness is so great, it trumps race and gender realities.For Pete Buttplug, all that matters is butt-blasting. Noticing that AIDS is a Darwinian mechanism to prevent homosexuality is unthinkable.Bernie excels in an environment where young university students and failed graduates pose as academics and intellectuals.Bloomberg has enough money to surround himself with Yes Men and impose his will on others – like any other rich man.The good news is that their environments are strictly limited and are actually in decline. But they are a great cautionary tale for us: what is our environment doing to us? Who is fit to lead us, speak for us, and protect our interests? What will we do to ensure we don’t set up an artificial stupidity chamber as they have done? The dissidents really need to jump on that, and fast.

            The Seabees and Army corp of engineers are trained to keep the infrastructure up and running in times of calamity.  Maybe part of the dissident movement could be the recruitment of and training of personnel to keep the lights on, keep the transportation network functioning and to see that basic functions and infrastructures keep things from collapsing into chaos.

                At a personal level, undertake to do as much work as you can on your home, car, and other possessions.  For all its warts, Youtube is a great resource for walking you through just about any project or repair.  And involved your kids as much as possible.  My grandfather was a fantastic carpenter in his free time, made everything from furniture to toys.  I don’t know how much he passed on directly to my dad but he too was very capable around the house.  Unfortunately, he didn’t conscript me to work on his projects.  I’ve had to play catch up in the past couple decades, but I’m now doing things that would have been unthinkable to me 20 years ago.  I’ll involve my daughter as much as I can during her formative years.

            The USA is too large, diverse and diffused in its interior to be governed by 1 POTUS, 9 SCOTUS, and 535 Congressional legislators.  The actual work of “leadership” has devolved onto thousands of mediocre, unelected bureaucrats.  Failure abounds.  Therefore, let 10,000 warlords bloom and rule, albeit violently, according to a principle of subsidiarity.

        Bloomberg’s anti-gun stance – which is VERY well known among the gun rights crowd,  will also factor into that antisemitism thing.Most of the pro-gun crowd is either trying very hard to not be antisemitic – or they just simply aren’t anti-semitic.  The arguments against the lunatic left gun grabbers are very predictably full of “Jews should be pro-gun because of what happened to them” lines of logic.If Bloomberg gets into office – and starts trying to grab guns with the same ferocity he went after blacks and Big Gulps with – you’re going to see the pro-gun crowd be FORCED to throw out a lot of their “Jews should defend gun rights” rhetoric.And I’d be willing to bet that all manner of Jewish organizations would align themselves behind Bloomberg if he were to do that – thereby piling onto that whole lack of self awareness thing you pointed out.

        This is five to 10 levels above the usual post, and most of those are pretty good.  The only thing missing is the cost of a Bloomberg Terminal with and subscription to connect to that “leased of course” box- about $24,000 per year.  It’s about saturating the institutional banking market like MS Office did for word processing, and then extracting the pound of flesh.  The words are “Rent Seeking.”  There used to be an FTC watching over these things.  It was on its knees by the Reagan era and the libertarian “natural monopoly” schtick was taking off, so its last big hurrah was the breaking up of Ma Bell.  If Ben Shapiro was doing his schtick in 1979, he would would talking about the efficiencies of Ma Bell and why “big government” has no business coming in and upending an entire industry that has severed America so efficiently since 1890.

            I have to go to the “Jews don’t have magic powers” thing here. I see that Jews are very frequently on the wrong side of issues in which I am interested, but there was no way they could force hundreds of millions of White Americans to turn into ” fat, happy , stupid bastards hooked on free porn and drugs” if the White Americans didn’t eagerly sign up for the program.

                    In the 1930’s Garet Garret wrote of the Frankfort School Jews–To the revolutionary mind the American vista must have been almost as incredible as Genghis Khan’s first view of China–so rich, so unaware. Why should anyone fear government? Its cruel and cynical suspicion of any motive but its own was a reflection of something it knew about itself. Its voice was the voice of righteousness; its methods therefore were more dishonest than the simple ways of corruption. Outside of the Communist Party and its aura of radical intellectuals few Americans seemed to know that revolution had become a department of knowledge, with a philosophy and doctorate of its own, a language, a great body of experimental data, schools of method, textbooks, and manuals.There was a prodigious literature of revolutionary thought concealed only by the respectability of its dress.

                Absolutely true.  It shouldn’t matter that Sheldon Adelson (Israeli govt. conduit) puts a billion dollars into political campaigns if the “average” American had even half a brain.  All they care about it their little slice of pie, which gets a little smaller every year.  The most effective money they ever spent was seeding the pockets of evangelical ministers to support the “we need a State of Israel for Jesus to come back” mantra.  Fifty years from now the most irreligious parts of the country will be today’s bible belt, and this will be front and center as to why.

                Rare disagree here, Vizzini.  The mere accusation of “antisemitism”  in some places will ruin a person’s life the same an accusation of racism.   I remember a *MAJOR* (/s) incident of antisemitism when I was a kid  when “Jews for Jesus” left tracts at local synagogues.

                That’s what a ruling elite with a vested self-interested mission of civilizational stewardship is for. It is not an accident that Jews institutionally seized and culturally transformed the Ivy League, the training ground for American elites. Once our WASP ruling elites were destroyed as a force capable of cohesive self-defense and their remnants co-opted, we fly-overs were left fat, dumb, and increasingly unhappy. Yes, we have turned into ”fat, happy, stupid bastards hooked on free porn and drugs” but so would every other people on Earth when bereft of its natural leadership class.The difference between the Jews and Chinese, Mexicans, Indians etc is that Jews have a 1500 year head start in building cultural/political institutions (with robust inter-generational transfer of knowledge) with purpose of seizing as much of the control nodes as possible of the European societies in which they live. The rest are catching up quickly, though.

Maybe it’s because I was extraordinarily unaware of Jews for most of my life, but I wonder how many people even know Bloomberg’s or Sanders’s ethnicity.

                People will always look past what they choose to look past.  Their peer group gives them the cues, and then they oblige.  Peer group is everything with most folks (including us).
Once the normies are scolded by other normies that it is “not OK” to Notice, that will be the end of that.  The sperginess of Mike is his biggest obstacle, IMO.

                Bernie Sanders (funny how his initials are “BS” isn’t it?),  is a perfect example of that lack of self awareness thing you mentioned.  The dipshit honeymooned in the Soviet Union,  defended Castro, has recently defended Venezuela, has supporters who outright call for some sort of commie revolt and concentration camps… etc.   And he’s out there on the campaign trail running on a platform that has the support of a lot of the same crowd that sees a Nazi under every bed.Bernie and Bloomberg – if they continue on their merry way – may well be singularly responsible for a revival of Nazism –  as well as some of the lesser known and memory-holed works of people like Solzhenitsyn, who has written about the outsized influence of Jews in the early years of the Bolshevik revolution.The normies and boomer conservatives aren’t going to like somebody reopening that long-buried connection ,  but they’re also going to be caught between a rock and a hard place – seeing as how their generation are the ones who ostensibly went to Vietnam and fought the commies – and ripped the country apart in the process.  The gun thing also factors in here – because all of the bible and gun clingers , who often intertwine with the Israel dick lickers – are going to have a hard hard choice to make.Do I keep deep throating that circumcised penis – or do I keep my guns?  Decisions….. decisions………….If either Bernie or Bloomberg get elected and actively start implementing their platform – I predict the most popular meme to appear somewhere in the 2022 timeframe is going to be a poster of Hitler waving a copy of Mein Kampf over his head with the words “I told you so” along the bottom.

        We’ll get to Bloomberg himself in a later comment.  Meantime though Z can’t help referencing such hateful non-entities like Ramesh Ponnuru (??!?  Why is a thing called “Ramesh Ponnuru” even living in my country, let alone having opinions about it?!), Kevin Williamson and the slithering human centipede David Brooks.  Why on earth these creatures have not been skinned alive like eels, let alone regarded as thought leaders, is an eternal mystery.Question for Z though: have you ever read anything by Wendell Berry?  I consider that his book “Home Economics: Fourteen Essays” is the most interesting deep-diving work of American political philosophy in my lifetime ( and this from a guy who tossed John Rawls in the garbage dump when he was 18.)Berry is a Kentucky farmer, and comes from a long line of farmers, and he views politics from a sort of organic, naturalistic, agricultural perspective.  I can sympathize, since most of my political thinking comes not from reading Plato and Locke and Aquinas, but from growing prize beefsteak tomatoes in my back yard as a kid.Interestingly, (at least to me), Berry doesn’t seem to understand his own schtick.  He lays out a series of very solid intellectual principles, then uses them to hawk a bunch of silly liberal giggles.  Herd mentality, perhaps.  Nevertheless his insights when gulped from the source are a billion times more useful than all the Ramesh whatevers.

        “[Bloomberg’s] breathtaking lack of self-awareness could create more anti-Semites in one year than have existed in North America since the first humans cross the Bering land bridge.”Hmmm…before WWII, there were LOTS anti-Semites in the US, at least by today’s sensibilities, e.g., Henry Ford’s “The International Jew,” quotas at Ivy league colleges, the exclusion of Jews from country clubs, Father Coughlin, Catholics in general, etc.if noticing that 9 of the top 10 donors to political campaigns in 2016 were Jews, that a Jew is planning on spending $1 billion+ of his own money to buy the presidency, that our military has been involved in conflicts in the Middle East for decades and that the only country that benefits from these wars is You Know Who, etc., is anti-Semitic,then we could use more of it.Will we get more anti-Semitism than we had in 1924 when the Johnson–Reed Act severely restricted Jews from immigrating to the US? Will we get more of if than we had in 1939 when the MS St. Louis, with over 900 Jewish refugees from Germany was refused entry into the US? I doubt it, but we could use more than we have now.

        You are describing societal entropy, the conversion of work into useless heat as a result of friction. In a sane natural world in which frugality evolves as a survival imperative, there is a strong incentive to minimize this type of wasteful parasitism. But in an era of extreme affluence, everyone thinks the gravy train will run forever. However, attitudes change fast when things get desperate. See Wuhan as example.

                Agreed, and that’s long overdue in my opinion. But a different paradigm is needed in order to prune the rot at the top of the parasite pyramid. Action on that front results in enormous beneficial change with far less collateral damage. Smarter, not harder.

        Must be strange to belong to a mere 2% of the overall population snd know that nobody really likes you. Not even yourself. Larry David for example in his eponymous show doesn’t present a single lovable tender Jewish character.They have to know Team Black despises them and Team Brown views them as the shysters of the Passion Plays.In my old teaching days it was remarkable to see well-bred politically correct  Gentile college kids turn into “ anti-semites” after a semester or two of their first real contact ,and competition with, Semites.Bloomberg was an effective mayor of NYC because the white voter saw him as a chance to continue Guiliani-ism. The stuff he’s apologizing for now is the stuff that kept the city safe for another eight years.

            All the people in “Seinfeld”, with the partial exception of Jerry, who was the set-up man for most of the gags, were absolutely awful human beings.  I realized at the time that there was a level of humor there, of which I could not fathom.  Thinking back, it was the idea of unleashing these sorts of people on a mostly unsuspecting public (both the minor characters in the show and the viewing audience).

Unless you’re from the NY Metro area you’re not exposed to that in your youth.  Even LA is too spread out to see the full scope of it.

        Like it or not, we live in the computer age.  No one here could turn off all their digital devices for a year and survive without regressing back to the 1950s, and regressing back to the 1950s would be physically impossible, so it can’t happen.Given that all information now is digital, the digital delivery man is unavoidable, even if he creates nothing of value beyond the delivery system.  Criticizing Bloomburg for delivering information is like criticizing grocery stores for extracting a fee for getting food from the farmer to the consumer.  How else are you going to get the product to 330 million Americans?You certainly can criticize Bloomburg for all the lunatic ideas that he supports, and you can lament and criticize the managerial reality that he represents and the managerial reality that we live in, but it’s hard to define any escape mechanism.Consider this.  Americans split the atom, won WWII on two fronts, created the transistor, and went to the moon without computers.  The final Saturn V rocket design was decided in 1962 and in 1968 we orbited the moon.  It took less than six years, from scratch, and the Saturn V never failed in 13 launches.Today, that kind of success is impossible.  We have the most powerful computers in human history, 60 years of experience in building rockets, and NASA’s current replacement heavy lift rocket has been on the drawing boards for more than 10 years. It might never even be built if SpaceX or Blue Origin succeed with their rockets, and their rockets also are decades in the making.The great success of Space X has been to let their booster drop back to earth by gravity with a guidance system so that it can land.  The achievements we celebrate today are massively diminished as compared to our past achievements.  And most of it is due to the capture of the human mind by a reliance on computers.Science is like an armadillo in the woods.  It keeps bumping into trees until it finds an opening, and that’s the direction it goes.  Computers and information cataloging are the natural results of inventing microprocessors, and the managerial state is the natural result of cataloging information. It makes us dumber and endlessly reliant on the computers and the people who control the information, but how do you escape?We are biological beings and our reality is inescapably biological.  Our destiny is biological, our fulfillment is biological, and our most fulfilling organizational strategies are biological.  But how do you escape the managerial man who reduces us to nodes on a network?

            Bloomberg did indeed revolutionize communication systems among banks, especially investment banking, with his terminals.  Banks like Morgan Stanley benefitted and the world benefitted.  However, once the saturation took place, it became such a dominant pipeline (see Google, Amazon, etc.) that it created its own market.  That’s bad. Your argument is a libertarian one.  Small guy makes big in the world, builds the Fountainhead, etc.  Ordinarily this is true, but when bottlenecks are created, innovation is crushed and fees are artificially high.  Standard Oil changed the world, but it was good that it was broken up.  Does anyone like flying United or American these days?  Bloomberg represents a bigger problem, one in which the country has been not only financialized, but carved up among juggernaut entities that put the customer last, extract from them, and thrive on 30 years of artificially low interest rates.  When the government breaks up a company you built for being too big and powerful in its niche, it should b the ultimate sign of success and “making it.”  I’ve never experienced such rage from libertarians as when I bring this up.  How dare I separate “capitalism” from the “free market.”  Yet there it is.

                Wow!  It’s always fun to make a comment here and come back a couple of hours later and have someone else explain your own words back to you!You’re the first person in my life who has accused me of making a libertarian argument. I’ve never voted for a libertarian, I don’t read the libertarian literature, I don’t hang out with libertarians, and I probably couldn’t even explain to you the basic ideas of libertarianism.  But, hey, thanks for explaining to me that I’m a libertarian!This is a common thing that happens on this blog.  You start with a simple observation about some comment from the Zman’s blog post, and that gets transmuted into the idea that you’re defending the general principles of some entire ideology that’s offensive to some people here.  It’s absolutely astounding how a reasonably minor comment becomes a defense of an entire ideology.The Zman started out his post by portraying Bloomberg as “the scheming middle-man, who produces nothing, but is highly skilled at inserting himself into transactions where he can extract a fee.”  I simply pointed out that that this is an over simplification.In the digital age, someone is going to deliver the information, whether it is Bloomberg or someone else, and they’re going to make a profit at it, just as in every other age there are always middle-men who deliver goods and services and make a profit. You may like it or not, you may think they are schemers and they are ripping off the public, or you may fantasize about some world where there are no middle-men, that’s up to you, but the fact that he made money as a middle-man is neither unusual or criminal or immoral.Beyond that I made no defense of Bloomberg. Nevertheless, you’ve transmuted my observation into a defense of everything you deem objectionable about Bloomberg: his “dominant pipeline,” that he “created his own market,” that he created “bottlenecks”, that “innovation is crushed,” that “fees are artificially high,” and that in fact it’s an even bigger problem than that because the country is “financialized” and “carved up among juggernaut entitites,” etc., etc.We’ll call it the “Zman Transmutation Effect.” Make a simple observation and become the defender of an entire ideology!Obviously you hate Bloomberg.  If it’s any solace to you, I won’t be voting for Bloomberg.  (But I guess I still have to go to confession and try to purge myself of that one molecule of libertarianism that somehow infiltrated my body.)

                    I’m not saying you’re a libertarian at all.  Long ago, in the early 80’s the mainstream financial media and mainstream politicians with them,  cherry picked about 10% of libertarian ideas and then packaged them as an alternate reality.  You’re just parroting what they peddled so long ago. No offense taken.  And by the way, on monetary policy they are correct, if they only stayed in that original lane.  Too bad no one cherry picked their monetary policy.

I don’t know if you are right, but we must guard against uncritically getting carried away with our own rhetoric.
It is a difficult line to walk between allowing innovators to become justifiably wealthy and incarcerating the monopolists.

                @LineInTheSandRe: “Respect for taking the unpopular position that Bloomberg is an innovator who earned his wealth.”That isn’t really the issue. Even if he earned his wealth fair-and-square (I am of the opinion he did nothing of the kind, but that’s a discussion for another day), does that entitle him to buy the political process, thereby subverting the idea of “one man, one vote” this country is supposed to be founded upon?Does it entitle him to “buy” the governor of Virginia and that state’s legislature, for his own personal ends?Bloomberg is a very dangerous man who – if he manages to attain the kind of power that goes along with being POTUS – will inflict untold damage upon our nation. He’s a wanna-be tyrant, and beneath all of that polish, a stone-cold killer.

        In Woody Allen’s Sleeper, he asks the future people what happened to end civilization, and the answer is “We’re not sure, but it appears someone named Albert Shanker acquired an atom bomb.”  Shanker was the particularly obnoxious head of the NYC teacher’s union, and that line always got a big laugh when people still remembered him.
In a similar movie, the question “How did the rule of the Jews come to such a sudden and violent end?” might have the answer, “We’re not sure, but it appears someone named Michael Bloomberg ran for President?”

        Z-man wrote of Bloomberg: “The most obvious being the scheming middle-man, who produces nothing, but is highly skilled at inserting himself into transactions where he can extract a fee.”I have been a design engineer in all my life and I would not call this man one who “produces nothing”:From wikipedia:“In 1973, Bloomberg became a general partner at Salomon Brothers, a large Wall Street investment bank, where he headed equity trading and, later, systems development. In 1981, Salomon Brothers was bought[19] by Phibro Corporation, and Bloomberg was laid off from the investment bank.[20] He was given no severance package, but owned $10 million worth of equity as a partner at the firm.[21]Using this money, Bloomberg, having designed in-house computerized financial systems for Salomon, went on to set up a company named Innovative Market Systems (IMS). His business plan was based on the realization that Wall Street (and the financial community generally) was willing to pay for high-quality business information, delivered as quickly as possible and in as many usable forms possible, via technology (e.g., graphs of highly specific trends).[22]Bloomberg, along with Thomas Secunda, Duncan MacMillan, and Charles Zegar, developed and built a computerized system to provide real-time market data, financial calculations and other financial analytics to Wall Street firms. The machines were first called “Market Master Terminals” and later became known as “Bloomberg Terminals.” In 1983, Merrill Lynch became the company’s first customer, investing $30 million in IMS to help finance the development of “the Bloomberg” terminal computer system. As of 1983, IMS was selling machines exclusively to Merrill Lynch’s clients; in 1984, Merrill Lynch released IMS from this exclusive deal.[23]”

                “Negative Identity” is my one significant area of disagreement with Z.
He says it doesn’t work and uses blacks as exhibit A.    I say the Black’s problem is the average IQ of 85, and that negative identity has worked out quite well for Shlomo.

                        I’m not sure where you’re coming from sometimes. I seem to recall that you once agreed that Jews have a negative identity. Their identity is wrapped up in their persecution by the goyim. It’s all about the Hall of Cost and how they need to remain united by their suspicion of the Gentiles. If they didn’t base their identity on fear and hostility they would probably have all been absorbed into their host populations. It may be a good survival strategy, but that doesn’t make it a positive identity. We’re not Jews so maybe we need a different strategy, but that doesn’t mean we can’t point out who our enemies are.

                            IIRC, I said that for many Jews, their identity is evolving into a negative one. That is a very recent thing and only in America. It’s also confined to the secular Jews, for the most part. In the main, Jews are a highly ethnocentric people whose identity is independent of their surroundings.

        Good article by the author, but he could have skipped most of it and gotten to the heart of the issue very quickly: Mike Bloomberg is a sociopath, and worse, a high-functioning sociopath, who are the most-dangerous kind. The low-functioning ones lack the self-control to function in wider society, so turn to serial crime instead – rape, murder and so on. The high functioning ones, however master saying and doing the right things to pass as more-or-less normal as they ascend up the heights of corporations or the lists of wealthiest people. Yet, underneath they remain as dangerous as ever.One psychologist of note estimated that 12-15% of the people in our soceity are sociopathic, nothing that many of the most-driven rise to lead corporations, enter politics or occupy other positions which allow them to exercise dominance over other people. This is what we are seeing in Bloomberg.Oh, and he is very dangerous for one other reason: He is one of the richest men in the world. How rich? His wealth far-surpasses that of Donald Trump.

        It would not shock me to learn that Bloomberg is running interference for Trump. He is either a sign that the DNC is convinced their nominee will walk away with 2020, or that Trump must be given the benefit of a maximally handicapped DNC ticket. Ultimately, the elite is very concerned about the democratic base having the same moment of clarity that many former Trump supporters have had: realizing that “populism,” is a snow job and that neoconservatism/neoliberalism is the only game in town, regardless of party.
