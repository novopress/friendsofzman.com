                !!! (((THEY))) CHEAT AT EVERYTHING !!!New York Times reportedly received millions in funding from U.S. governmenthttps://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/4295272/posts…the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was the largest contributor, providing $26.9 million,while the National Science Foundation followed with $19.15 million.Notably, the U.S. government allocated $4.1 million to the NYT in August 2024 alone…(((The Ochs Sulzberger))) gazillionaires are such psychopathic hand-rubbers that they can’t even be bothered to dip into their own Mount Everest of shekel-piles to fund their own psy-ops.The frigging “NSF”, the National Science Foundation, to whom all of us were supposed to have applied for graduate school scholarships; all of that money was diverted back to the grinning hand-rubbing Ochs-Sulzberger thieves.Where’s the Zyklon B when you need it?!?!?

            Somebody on another page chastised me for feeling that way and I think he has a point. He said we all should hope for Israel to survive and thrive. Why? Because if Israel falls apart, the vast majority are going to end up here.
It is a sobering thought to consider the idea that Jews might end up being 4% of the population once Israel gets cleaned out.

                Israel’s strategic value in the middle east was to function as a monkey wrench thrown into arab politics. They are experts at dividing the locals in order to control them as we have seen here in the west. They were remarkably successful to be honest. The remarkable rise of sexual perversion and devastated families has their finger prints all over it.Unfortunately with the debacle shaping up in Gaza, Israel is now galvanizing the arabs and unifying them. They are rapidly changing from an asset in middle eastern geopolitics to a distinct liability – especially now that mass migration of moslems has taken place.Things are going to get very, very interesting.

                    Sometimes I wonder if this is another example of the Mandela Effect. In my timeline, the ME has always been a fractious bunch, unless under a strong, even brutal leader. It took a Caliphate to get them to put aside that silliness of Mo’s legitimate successor. Once that Caliphate was gone, there were back to their tribal squabbles, much like you would expect of any group of tribes.
Israel has had a minimal role in keeping musloids divided. If anything, the entire history of modern Israel is one of uniting the Arab League.

                Lord Balfour (of Balfour Declaration) was known antisemite. The sole point of British support of the creation of Israel was (citing from as jewish as it gets Forward rag): “According tohistorians, Balfour had personally delivered passionate speeches about the imperative to restrict the wave of Jews fleeing the Russian Empire from entering Britain.”
Methinks, the best solution was and still is by Stalin: relocating the source of troubles to Birobidzhan in South Siberia, bordering China. World can humbly ask Chinese to re-apply their ancient knowledge, and build the (very, very tall and thick) wall encircling the area.

Human travel to Mars was impossible when the Jewish Autonomous Oblast was declared, and it still wasn’t possible in 1996, whenthe contemporary flagwas adopted. In fact, human travel to Mars remains impossible today but not for much longer, maybe no more than five years. Then Elon’s need for warm bodies will become acute, and, if he’s still alive, he’ll have several scores to settle with the nation of Jacob.

                    Agree. The British version of the Havarra Transfer Program operated through the ’30s and the War, but like their relatives in Germany, the middle class Juden (who are NOT the problem) didn’t want to leave civilization for a crappy colony, and participation was low.
They undoubtedly saw the Autonomaus Oblast in Siberia as an extremely crappy Pale; the diff is Stalin didn’t forcibly relocate them as he did others, as they were his managerial class, he only knocked them off the throne.
Big J used Germany to force Little J to do his colonizing for him.

            Frankly, I watched that I wondered if Trump was not trolling Netanyahu. Trump’s plan to turn Gaza into a resort is so ridiculous that I have to assume there is something else going on. For his part, Netanyahu looked like he had a bad clam. The whole thing was so weird I think we have to wait to see what is really going on.

                i think trump is making hamas *and* israel think about if both lose gaza.  and he is making other arab states think if they really want palistinian refugee camps in their countries.  in other words, he is making the status quo untenable for everyone in the ME.

                    Since Jordan got into a war with the Palestinian refugees, and had to use the Arab Legion to kick them out, I doubt that anyone will take them…and it’s likely that many Arab countries would prefer both the Israelis and the Palestinians gone….

                    They don’t want the Palestinians anymore than we do.  They are nothing but trouble everywhere they go.  I think China has the right way of dealing with them as they deal with the Uyghurs.

                You might have a point there.Back in the 2016, the predecessors to Q were posting on 4chan. Namely, FBI Anon and Mega Anon. I forget which of the two posted this, but they intimated that BiBi was a family friend of the Kushners who used to stay at their place. Specifically in Jared’s bedroom.Ignore that if you want, but think back to a few weeks ago where Trump tweeted that that link saying that BB was a “deep, dark, son of a bïtch.” Is that what he meant or was he just referring to the general evil of the guy?This indeed could be Trump’s pointed sarcasm.https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/08/trump-video-crude-reference-netanyahu

I look at the guy, paunchy, poorly dressed with an ugly wife.
Turns out his prattle included mentioning he had a “favorite porn star” and “do you have one…?”

                My first reaction when I read the headline with Trump’s proposal was almost despair.  But then I reminded myself that a good negotiator never starts with what he actually wants.  Personally, I’d pave over both Gaza and Israel – but as TempNick says, the last thing we want or need is all the Jews and Palestinians in AINO – or Canada, Europe, Australia, etc.  I have no good solution but will wait and see what Trump actually does.  His zionist tendencies and big Jewish donors still concern me, though.

                    Make Gaza an Indian reservation for the Palis – get the jews and arabs to pony up for reconstruction and build that beautiful casino resort (jews get a cut, Arabs won’t get resettled palis).  Let the Palis run them/staff them (jobs!) with jewish oversight and taking a cut (usury is their middle name, no?).  They can be a state within a state just like indians are here.  Or like Vatican city. Most Vegas properties are staffed by illegals here, the same could work for Gaza.  Do West Bank too while were at it.

                        Gaza is already run with Jewish oversight. Many Jews hate the Palestinians, see them as subhuman, and think it is their religious duty and obligation to wipe them out.
Not to mention gambling is totally degenerate and haram. You won’t get Muslims to work there and aid in grave sin. This is totally crazy.

Drugs are probably the #2 source of income in the Middle East, and gambling is as inshallah as it gets for bored hedonists loaded with money. Muslim women inhale pills. Macau is filled with Arab tourists. The moment they get on a jet plane, the burkas come off and the booze breaks out.

                                Years ago I listened to an interview with a journalist who was very critical of Saudi Arabia. A caller asked him why he didn’t respect the right of the Saudis to run their societies according to their own religious ideas. The journalist replied that he had no problem with that but he did have a problem with the hypocrisy of the Saudi elite. He cited a prince he knew who during the Islamic fasting period of Ramadan was in a bar in Hong Kong having a good time, behavior he said was routine for Saudi bigwigs.

                                I would argue there is a massive difference between someone surreptitously having a few bottles of wine in their house and suiting up and going to work at a casino that was imposed upon your neighborhood by the American empire.
It’s not like casinos were the Indians’ first choice either. And look, I am not a bleeding heart, we conquered the continent, it is ours and not theirs anymore. But I don’t want America to own the ethnic cleansing of Gaza and the imposition of fake and gay USAID/Totalitarian Personality/Eros &amp; Civilization values upon the region.

                It’s one thing to propose crippling tariffs to try to force a deal, it’s another to put ethnic cleansing on the table. What Trump proposed was totally bizarre in every sense of the word. I don’t see how this is in America’s best interest to even propose this.

                    As I speculate elsewhere, it could be that he’s just that obtuse to say stupid shit. Or does his madness have a method? By floating such ridiculous trial ballons, he shines a spotlight on a lot of the vested interests (or, in the present case, wannabe vested interests). Is that intentional or not? Your guess is as good as mine.

                        I don’t really think that Trump believes this is a good idea; we all know he hates Netanyahu and it is almost like he floated the craziest idea he could think of just to put this war criminal scumbag on the spot. But… hedidpropose it. Even as a lunatic half-troll idea just saying it on a camera is a bad idea.

                Last time he was president he tried being Reagan II and got screwed. This time the persona is Teddy Roosevelt.Reduced to a simple, repeatable, recognizable move—a brand—Roosevelt isludicrous imposition,comically unreasonable demands barked at the whole world, seemingly from out of nowhere. Apersonal fantasyof commanding a throbbing young empire.Trump’s not the kind of lunatic TR was, but acting that way looks like a lot of fun, and it “gets results”—very badresults, but those are in the sequels.Back when Trump wasn’t going to be president (or alive), junior Kushner was already put in nominal charge of the ruins of Gaza, appointed the Trumpian face (old NYC Trump) of its resort redevelopment/erasure, so this isn’t a land grab for his family or whatever. Open appropriation of Gaza byAmericais a goofy idea nobody predicted or wants, like annexing Canada. To what end? “Bully!”He’s justfully inhabiting the officethis time, like everyone says—without thinking about what that might mean tohim. He’s delegated almost everything (or lost it, depending what pill flavor you like). What’s left is tobePresident. To Rushmore!

                That was a direct shot at Israel’s real objective which is to boot the natives and build beachfront resorts in Gaza.  Trump was poking them in the eye and basically saying “We’ll take that land before you do and then we’ll give it to the Palis.”Also today it was reported that Hegseth plans to remove all US troops from Syrian in the next roughly 90 days.  One of the great shocks that followed Trump’s win and Assad’s exile was when people found out there are a lot of US troops in Syria, that they are regularly attacked, and that the Biden regime lied.  There aren’t 900 there.  The real number is north of 2,000.A lot of people on this blog assumed Trump would go full Zionist once in power.  I predicted the opposite and so far I’m right.Watch for him to make a big move on a peace deal with Iran.  Not because Trump ever said it, but because it would exactly fit his model for concluding the many wars over there.

                Ryan sabotaged the 2018 midterms by resigning and taking 40 GOP reps with him.  They did this specifically expecting Pelosi to impeach.  Then Fox gave him a cushy job to reward him financially.  Fortunately, the blue wave stuff was a lie, and the GOP Senate expanded.  So Trump could not be removed.

            I am not anti-Israel, or anti-Jewish, or anti-Arab. I am, however, anti-endless bullshit. My first memory of the ME drama was the 1967 Six-Day War. At the age of seven, I became a “fan” of Israel with its plucky, resourceful military, routing all the baddies of the Arab League. Comes the Yom Kippur war of 1973, and – being now a fan – I rooted for the Israelis, just as I was by then rooting for the Orioles, the Knicks and the Chiefs. They were the good guys, the Arabs were the bad guys, same as Willis Reed, Brooks Robinson and Len Dawson were the good guys, while John Havlicek, Reggie Jackson and Darryl Lamonica were the bad guys. The moral being, of course:WhenIwasachild,Ispakeasachild,Iunderstoodasachild,Ithoughtasachild: butwhenIbecameaman,Iput away childish things.

        When even some guy in his recliner (me) was able to see what USAID was up to around the world, which happened I dunno, 3 or 4 years ago, then that means the leaders of foreign countries had figured it out sometime before that. There are only so many color revolutions you can run before people get wise to the playbook. Maybe Maidan was the last big “successful” one. Unfortunately normie AINO citizen was still not hip to it yet in 2020 when they did it here.I’ve noted before the debate in this comment section about whether Obama was running this shadow government. And usually he is given little credit for it. But whether he was personally running it or not, the takeover of the USAID/NGO apparatus by his people, put in place during his administration, was what got us to this point. This USAID edifice, whatever it used to be decades ago, had become the international (and domestic) arm of the Obama/baizuo/rainbow alliance. Clown World Inc, you could call it.The new regime in its place appears to be Trump as laser pointer and everyone else as cats, until further notice.

Beautiful…!
(I take it that a lot of you folks are not from Gotham, which explains (maybe?) a lack of understanding of how to play ball successfully in a league that’s dominated by “a certain ‘crew’?” )

I follow the news and regardless of what is going on, I truly don’t care because the people who despise me and want me and my family dead (Heritage Americans) are losing their effing minds and crying buckets of tears and have ZERO idea of what to do every time Trump, or one of his aides-de-camp open their mouths.a friend of mine literally begins shaking every time she hears his name mentioned, much to the chagrin of her daughter. It’s all so very entertaining.

            I will have to dig up the link, but there is a video article at Vlad Tepes and a book about the incestuous circle of Obama, Holder, Clyburn, Keith Ellison, Kamala and their ilk as being the direct heirs groomed for the task of turning America into a Black Red/Green Communist Muslim state.Kamala’s parents were both cell members of the Bay Area cadre led by Khalid al-Mansur, the guy who founded the Black Panthers and went to work in Saudi Arabia to get the imprimatur by a sheikh that got Obama into Harvard.Obama’s grandparents and mother were hard Seattle communists working for the CIA fomenting color revolution in Indonesia, Kenya, and Pakistan; Kamala’s maternal grandfather Gopalan was the USSR/Israel backed right hand man of the African Communist triad that destroyed Rhodesia and split it into Zimbabwe/Zambia. (His “father” on paper, Obama Sr., failed to foment counter-revolution in Kenya and died in a car crash; he failed because he was from the wrong tribe, being Luongo and not Kikuyu.)Kamala was the point, the future capstone of the Revolution, not merely a brainless twit that found herself in over her head. This is why Obama blocked his former boss Hillary’s ambition and usurped her, he was using her and the system as a stepping stone to his own agenda.

                Trump didn’t have the wherewithal to take down these people’s organizations. This is the work of the new ascendant oligarchy that is backing him, who, for whatever reason, have had it up to here with Clown World Inc. While the ousted faction still exists, so much of the organization that they’ve spent years building, commandeering, and refining, is just gone. Just like that. Sucks having to start over late in life. The still unanswered question going forward: what do the new oligarchs really want?

        This is why the American empire is beginning to withdraw from the frontiers.
According to a Chinese “geopolitical analyst” I follow on youtube, the consensus among Chinese intellectuals is that the US’s desire to annex Greenland, Canada, Mexico and the Panama Canal is the logical behavior of a retreating empire. Trump and the people around him understand that the US can’t sustain its position as the global hegemon. Absorbing the surrounding countries would work as a protective measure in a multipolar world.

                It is rich and filled with resources. My neighbors, all from Mexico, tell me once you get past Baja, the north- that’s where the very racist mestizos pushed what remained of their indio tribes, into the barbaric Yaqui territory that even Aztecs couldn’t conquer, so barbaric were they- that once you get past the north, there is high tech everything: hospitals, oil refineries, factories, skyskrapers, etc.Now, high tech is not like urban China, which is the 22nd century, but it is certainly far more than Detroit in the civilized spots. (My next door neighbor lived in adobe with no electricity, Juarez across the Rio from El Paso used to visibly be a lightless slum.) Cabbages as big as basketballs in Guerrero, the tropical southern border estado.In regards to Panama, Greenland, etc., the Can-Am-Mex state, I think that’s why Rubio was sent on a fence-mending trip through Central to Latin America. I much agree that the Empire may be withdrawing to its Monroe Doctrine borders, even to the point of consolidating the continent.Vancouver has become the Chinese fentanyl distribution and Triad money laundering hub up north, with Baja being the same down south, as well as the main port for Chinese goods (so they can cheat on import duties.) Thus, our neighbors are now a matter of national security.Consolidation into a defensible Eurasia West seems the most probable course to deal with our demographic situation as Brazil Norte; it worked for Greater Russia. Canada would stand for Eastern Europe, CentroAmerica would stand in the place of the Turkic Muslim Stans, the Caribbean would be our Georgia/Azerbaijan/Armenia boot.You betcha, Greenland would make a great Siberia, we could put the unemployed international development folks to work there mining rare earth minerals with pickaxes. They revere the Soviet Union, don’t they?

                    Mexico is extremely diverse ecologically and topographically, once you pass the northern desert section.  Jungles, highlands, huge mountains, seaside, so forth.
I wandered all around the place in the old days.  Nobody who has travelled there would consider Mexico barren, except as to its marxist, feminist President Claudia.
Nor is the western U.S. ‘barren’.  Come on folks, look at a map at least.

                            Now hold on! I was telling those Montana supremacists we have just as many trees in Nevada as they do.
They’re just, like, really small. Dwarfish, you could say.Only about a foot and a half tall. We call them sagetrees.

                            Yes, the low and high deserts are in the West.  Part of the splendor and majesty that resides in the West.  Tetons, Sierras, Cascades, Rockies, stamp of God is on them.
I lived at high altitude in N.M. for many years.  I enjoyed the wide-open vistas for hundreds of miles.  Leave the city and in twenty minutes you’re in desert or mountains, peace and silence.
Yes I’m biased, I consider everything east of the Rockies as graduated swampland, a few mountains mixed in.

                                Couldn’t agree more. Southwestern landscapes are the best. There’s a reason most great Westerns feature panoramic cinematography that captures the stark grandeur of this region.

                Baja’s a nice place. My wife from volcanic Italy says it’s like home “but California.” Which may just mean it’s full of Mexicans. I really only know what Sammy Hagar sings about it.Every few years there’s a little manufactured groundswell among conservatives to take Baja and give it to “Israel” (American land and finance conglomerates). I’ve never heard a plan for what to do with the rest of Mexico when it “joins” us, via treaty or conquest or whatever.The visions of Mexican voters dancing through Democrats’ heads have been soiled by their men’s liking of Trump (and Morrissey). That’s why they’ve dug deeper into Central and South America for “migrants,” leapfrogging the Mexicans like they’re Cubans. Absorbing Mexicomight nothurt you—no more than it already has—so they don’t want to do it anymore.

                    Give ’em Baja as Tel Aviv Tijuana?Might as well, they already own Monterrey.Edit: Oops, you said “Israel”. Well, American retirees have colonized Baja in spades, so consider the deed already done. We have retiree towns numbering in the thousands down there. The expats tell me it’s their little secret, like Corpus Christi’s sorority-only nude beaches.(Nope, tall wooden fences and no guys allowed, so don’t anybody get ideas. I found out cuz a well dressed, charmingly accented Latin lad was in the rest area with a Polaroid. When a carful of girls pulled in, he’d ask them if he could take their picture, and they’d start dropping their laundry right there. He’d hand them their picture, say thank you, and I must’ve spent hours chatting with him for some reason. It was a busy Spring Break after all, and I was the most innocent of angels.)

                Mexico, run properly, could be a jewel in the crown of our Empire. That aside – a century-long undertaking, I imagine – seizing and ruling Mexico with a firm hand would largely destroy the drug trade that is doing so much to wreck our society.Ordinary Mexicans would probably greet us as liberators. Of course there would have to be a 25-50 year delay in giving it statehood. No, they’d be a conquered people, much as the Germans and Japanese in 1945.As to Canada, well, we could give lenient conditions for statehood to all the provinces west of Ontario, except perhaps British Columbia (Vancouver and all). The Maritime provinces would be required to band together into a single state. Quebec and Ontario – who hate each other, as I understand it – can sort things out among themselves. Humor would ensue…

                    Psst. Mexico has Pemex oil, and this time socialista Pancho Villa wouldn’t be attacking the Exxon oil rigs.
Plus, yes, they’ve been in a Cartel civil war, after Pappy Bush and Salinas moved the Contra drug money banks from Colombia and Panama to Mexico City.
From the hairy-scary stories I’ve heard over years, they would hail us as liberators, and their men could stay home. There are whole towns of all daughters because all the husbands went north. If a doctor did well and tried to open a small hospital, his daughter wouldn’t get kidnapped for the ransom money.

                Call China an expanding empire if it colonises the Caribbean (roughly as far from China and as close to the USA as Philippines was vice-versa).Apart from the trade issue, the PRC is content to be the regional hegemon in East and South-East Asia.China really has three main geostrategic objectives: (1) not to have US-funded foreign troublemakers on its periphery, (2) to ensure that its trade route access to the Pacific and Indian Oceans cannot be blockaded (3) possession of a bastion sea for its SLBM deterrent == doesn’t want US sticking SOSUS type arrays in South China Sea or in the first Island Chain.As far as I can tell from my limited reading, Chinese and Russian Intellectuals are presently far more realistic and a lot less rabid than our crop of same. Americans and Westerners in general have this huge problem of being unable to even conceive that the Other Side might have valid concerns — this goes back to post-war liberal consensus mind virus, of course.

            This seems right. In a way, the purpose of the Ukraine war reflected a decision to downsize the empire, specifically to pull back initially to a Europe divorced from Russia, and then to fall even further back to the Western hemisphere. It has a certain logic to it despite the deranged aspects such as the prospect of nuclear war and integration with Mestizos. Ditching imperialism should be the goal, of course, but people are greed heads.

            Ah, the “red giant theory of history.”
Contraction by expansion? Not to refute Chinese intellectuals, but wtf? If the US cannot sustain itself as a global hegemon, then by what logic does it “absorb” large countries on its borders? This is like expecting a decaying Soviet Union to “absorb” (in its dying convulsions) Iran, Finland, Mongolia, Poland…
The whole subject is preposterous, like Martian colonization. I salute Orange Hitler for the trolling.

        Once the USAID money dried up, the protests dried up…The modern state of Israel was formed in 1948, which means it is reaching its eighth decade. The current troubles in the Levant are rooted in the growing instability of Israel…As to the first full sentence, it will be interesting to see if the same about protests applies domestically. I expect it will.As to your last there, somehow related is Trump’s bizarre and alarming announcement yesterday that essentially called for the ethnic cleansing of Gaza and basically a yuge casino on the strip. I don’t think that will or even can happen, but it indicates Trump will try to shore up Israel in the short-term by any means possible despite its supposed 80-year expiry date. Hopefully this will further strengthen young white men’s resolve not to degrade and debase themselves with military service, and reveals that the Regime realizes the clock is winding down on Our Greatest Ally as something more than a creepy theocratic police state.

                As you commented earlier, Palestine essentially is an Indian reservation. In a sense, Israel is an Indian reservation for Jews. If it ceases to exist the diaspora will be a calamity for the recipient nations. The likely future for Israel will be as a deranged theocracy with an overwhelming religious majority. In an odd way, that may prove to be far more stable.
I don’t know the purpose of suggesting Gazans be ethnically cleansed for a casino/strip mall, but the odds are great that was floated for a reason other than what was stated.

            Maybe it’s connected in imperial terms with Trump’s interest with Greenland and the Panama Canal. I read somewhere a while back that Israel wants to build a new canal bypassing Suez with its northern terminus in north Gaza. This fits in with his son-in-law’s plans for resort properties there. Trump being a real estate developer at heart senses yuge potential if Israel is about to go tits up. It is logical yet bizarre (or bazaar).

                Right.  The dood is a developer and salesman of upscale to lavish properties.  So that’s his vision of the Strip shoreline, that’s his solution.  Build huge effing hotels for the monied.
It’s either that, or turn Gaza into a giant gameshow, with Chuck Woolery reincarnated roaming the Strip with contestants, to determine which fortunate wins a country for residence.
Ah, the humanity!  It’d sell like opium hotcakes.  Trumpster and Big Barron co-ordinate action from the Blue Room and make surprise appearances.

                However, there’s nothing to keep them in Gaza *except* a lack of places to go to.  Gaza is basically destroyed and now uninhabitable, which seems to have been the Israeli plan all along.  What seems to have eluded the Israelis is that the Palestinians have warn out their “welcome” in every country they’ve fled to.  Hence they have no where to go from Gaza.  Trump will have to figure this one out.

                    They don’t need or probably even want to run the whole thing. I’m sure that, just like Atlantic City and Vegas, they would be perfectly fine with other developers getting a piece of the action.
Regardless, it seems silly to allow a group that’s rightfully hated more than jews to have land that would be much more useful in a more civilized world. If Shitcongo were to start slamming missiles into Indiana, I sure as heck would want the B-52s to prove that LeMay was a piker. They shouldn’t have that great lakeshore area if they can’t be civil.

                        The majority in Jordan- the original Mandate state- still live in tents.  The Gazans are so oppressed they’ve increased their population several times over.
This is not one, but two nefarious governments at work.Hamas was created to wind the Palis up and give Israel plausible cause- otherwise Israeli jets would’ve been strafing those giant Hamas street demonstrations. Iran, being occupied, is run by mullahs who feel about Israel like the neocons feel about Russia. The Shia rulers probably think their proxies will win the hearts of the Sunni; if they destroy Israel, they win the keys to the Kaaba.

            Oh, come on, man! Have a heart, will you? After all, Ivanka’s husband has to have SOMETHING to occupy his time. And turning Gaza into Atlantic City East seems just the thing!
Just think how cool this would sound in Hebrew:

                    If this turning is some ancient Chinese secret, then the CCP has to be sweating bullets. Their 80th anniversary comes up in 2029. Maybe we should be sweating bullets too, if Xi and his gang believe in “the turning”.

                        The Chinese think in dynastic terms. Once well-established and bedded down, dynasties tend to last Glubb’s ~250 years or so.Very often when a dynasty falls, the process is very traumatic and involves incredible loss of life and decades or even centuries of warlordism before a new one arises. The relatively quick (several decades) Ming collapse and Qing takeover was almost too peaceful. I guess only several tens of millions died that time.The long Qing collapse and warlordism and civil war and initial communist bloodletting took a good century of bloodbath to get to the present tolerably good situation in the PRC. They’re not in a hurry to go back for a re-run. Memories are fresh. So I don’t think there’ll be an 80 year ‘turning’ — although you can be sure that the various clandestine arms of USGov have been doing everything in their power to give the Panda a bad case of HIV.

                Ya gotta take it with a grain of salt. Technically the first kingdom started something like 40 years earlier under Saul. And there’s nothing I know of to start the clock ticking around 10 BC that makes the 70 AD fall of Jerusalem a data point. By 10 BC, the Romans had already owned the place for half a century, and the Pharisees got going a century before that.
But most ideas coming from jewish minds seem to have an extremely short sell-by date.

            Trump is prone to megalomaniac statements but he’s also a master of gamesmanship. Does he sincerely  want to see Miami Beach II on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean? Certainly there are plenty of (((Western))) business interest that would love to do so, especially if Uncle Sam will pick up the tab to maintain property values and relative peace in that area. But consider on the other hand that even such a proposal outs these vested interests. And, perhaps, it will make Normie ask why is the US so involved in a place like Gaza?

        Handing power to a minority ethnic group is also the first step in colony building. Usually, Europeans found some halfway decent ethnic minority to help build the colony.
It’s not a new observation that once decolonization wiped away the empires, the cloud people started importing them or found weird minorities among us. Like Blacks in the South.
Empire always washes back, it’s why nations should stick to creating living space.

        George Friedman, a propaganda tool of Rand Corp posing as a futurist, essentially said that creating instability everywhere is the very purpose of the American empire.I was able to stomach a couple of minutes of the presser with Trump and Ghoulman. First, I want Our flag centered always. It isn’t a peer of any other nation on our soil. We spend the blood and the treasure. I digress. Watching Ghoulman smug and smiling as Trump announced the ethnic cleansing of Gaza was sickening. Now America is sponsoring the ethnic cleansing of Gaza and handing that resort land to Israel. Israel knew exactly what it was doing and forced everyone’s hand. Oh no. Well shucks. It is all rubble now see, and the only thing we can do is resettle them and turn it into a resort.When the Left comes back in power there will be a pity party for those people and they will import them here and to Europe. Our greatest pariah doesn’t give two figs. It all makes me sick. I don’t care what happens over there, but that we are stuck as the bag man and get all of the headaches and none of the benefits makes me sick to my stomach. That Trump is on it leaves a stain and a stigma on our cause that may be impossible to rid ourselves of.I tuned in to that because Waltz the day before talked about the ME getting speed trains, massive energy depots … … What do we get? When do we get some goods? Why does this empire always seem to hand our wealth and the fruits of our labor over to well placed minorities who bribe our system through clever names like, “campaign contributions?”By all signs right now, it looks like the 80 year rule has been smashed. The Levantine Imperium is ascendent and the annexation of the West Bank is going to happen. In addition, Karp and the boys are going to make their little state the capital of the digital panopticon. Ghoulman and the boys have been working on this for years.The jury is out on whether or not the majority will rule. Besides, we aren’t the majority anymore. That ship has sailed unless economic pain is inflicted to bring about mass self-deportation. That will have a back seat to hyper-growth as they will invite every hungry hungry mouth with capable enough hands in legally to do this build-out.I doubt minoritarianism is dead. It has been the way of things since the dawn of time. The issue is, can we, the majority now plurality, ascend and form an elite from our people that will be the ruling minority?Right now, it smells a lot like the tech bros and the greatest ally played both sides of it and the bulk of their wish list will be implemented. Is that better than Kamala? Of course. Does that fundamentally change our position? It gives us a bit more room to move to take control of our destiny. It us up to us to be the minority that is the early mover within and for our own cause.

            Wars have a way of strengthening the executive. The bigger, the better. Bibi is doing this right this moment.
If a major war, even as a “last hurrah”, was the only way Trump/Vance can keep steamrolling through Washington and create an unstoppable right wing dominance of power for the next 80 years (like FDR), would it be worth the price?
Hell of a gamble. Just a random thought.

                    At a minimum, we’ll get Pre-crime in the US.
Worst case these idiots will actually manage to bring something like Colossus or Skynet online.
These projects will be funded by anything that doesn’t get allocated to Elon’s Mars project.

                        The worst case is worse than that, and it’s the most likely one—the one they’ve already almost implemented:They’ll give the job of Skynet to a congenitally retarded chatbot that’s competent at nothing but flattering its master.H1-B analogy goes here.Thousands, most of them entirely innocent of dissidence, have had their livelihoods yanked away by “AI” given deplatforming power at YouTube, X, Stripe, Cloudflare, etc.—even PornHub, whose parent company bot-deleted and bannedalmost 100%of its accounts to prevent future Hunter Biden incidents.(Does anybody remember that it all started with someone posting his PornHub account to Kiwi Farms? And soon, KF was banned bytier 1 networks. Josh just got back onto Twitter a few weeks ago by pretending to be an Indian.)

            Yes, Israel and NATO Turkey are in an alliance, a replay of the banker-backed alliance with the Young Turks that led the the Armenian Genocide and the seizure of Greek lands towards the last gasp of the Ottoman Empire in 1924.Syria’s dense blanket of Russian air defenses was wiped out the week after HTS proxies caused Assad to flee; aerial fueling tankers can now give Israeli jets the reach they need to hit Iran and return. Israel plans to replace Iran as the southern Silk Road gateway and owner of the Gaza terminus of the Ben Gurion Canal competing with Egypt’s Suez. (Ukraine was the northern leg.) The Red and Arabian Seas are gateway to both Europe and Africa for Asian trade.A Gaza Vegas is entirely in the cards, a Beirut Rotterdam might be next, and Turkey keeping half of Cyprus ensures steady cooperation with the offshore gas development. Qatar already has the LNG buildout covered.Trump has announced that Ukraine owes Blackrock, Cargill, and Monsanto fulfillment of their signed contracts for its resources as payment for our military aid. That’s called a return on a $200 billion investment.Ukraine is winding down, with territory taken; the Middle East is about to have its borders rewritten yet again.Better, some say, an Eretz Ysrael and Neo-Ottoman empire than a terrorist Shia Crescent. The Biden admin’s focus was Ukraine, Trump’s will be the Levant.

        here is a wild card.   as the western world transitions to nuclear power as the dominant energy source, the ME stops being important (due to demand for hydrocarbons dropping off a cliff).  only the suez canal and red sea are strategically valuable at that point.
for point of reference, one pound of uranium has as much energy as 2M pounds of oil.  it’s all about energy density; we have been climbing the energy density ladder since mastering fire.

            In space it is already a mobile/propulsive energy source. It will be quite some time before we use it for propulsion on earth. That said, synthetic methane is being put to interesting use. Check out the bad-assery happening at Astro Mechanica.We are not ditching fossil fuels any time soon. The significance of nuclear will be our ability to power our redoubts with it and become increasingly less reliant on centralized power generation. Check out the developments at Radiant.Macro politics are far less important to us than developments in energy, as you point out. Small scale nuclear power generation is revolutionary in terms of us being able to decrease reliance on larger, centralized powers to create and power our own redoubts and communities.You can see the tension between these forces. At once, global connectivity will only increase and at the same time the ability to increase sovereignty and increase isolation will also increase. It is up to us, to adopt, master and harness these developments for our purposes.The Middle East and its fossil fuels will be important for a long time. That said, it can be less important to us as smaller scale nuclear emerges. It will decrease the need for diesel in naval locomotion and stationary power for many industrial and community applications.I am really sick of our continent being tied up in the Middle East. We should liquify coal for locomotion until we master small scale nuclear for it, and be done with that god forsaken place.

        The story of 20th century domestic politics in the United States is one of discord and friction over race, region, and religion. Over and over one group is pitted against another preventing a majority forming up against the ruling class. Conservatism, for example, evolved so it could prevent a white majority forming up against the social policies preferred by the ruling elite. The many progressive causes were promoted to keep the coalition of fringes under control.hmmm. Wonder what group ensures that? Can’t quite put my finger on who would do that? Every single time I just can’t quite figure it out…

        All societies are ruled by an elite, whatever they call their system. In liberal democracies, elitism is practiced but officially frowned upon. Pre-liberal societies were explicitly elitist. What is peculiar about liberal societies is the blatant hatred of the elite for the rest of society. This is particularly evident in the USA, with its wealthy and powerful Jewish elite, who are the traditional enemies of the Christian societies they dwell among. Pre-liberal elites would not have dreamed of demoralizing their populations or admitting huge numbers of hostile foreigners into their countries, both of which are routine in liberal societies. In pre-liberal times, such behavior was more characteristic of an occupying foreign power than a native governing elite.

        Mostly agree. My only addition would be to State what should be obvious yet it often goes unsaid, that money or greed is often a prime motivator. Note that I’m by no means saying that it’s the only motivator but I would argue it it probably often is especially in the world of politics. Let’s face it, 99% of what USAID wanted to happen would never have happened unless a lot of money changed hands.I wish Musk and his boys, and they are very young, the greatest success in coming through the Treasury’s database. I’m sure some most interesting patterns might emerge. Whether they dare release it, or even are allowed to remains to be seen.Perhaps some of that funding really did provide medical care and food to starving people. But I suspect some of it found its way into domestic political campaigns. It’s for uses like that that people should go to prison and for a long time. I’m guessing that Biden didn’t pardon everybody involved.

        I know it will be a tremendously unpopular viewpoint, but Dissidents are woefully unaware that hindsight is always 20/20.The reason America became embroiled in other nation’s affairs and policing them arose from the experience of WW2. Churchill and any number of other voices (called German-O-phobes at the time) – were screaming bloody murder about the rise and growing threat on Nazi Germany. But Chamberlain and pretty much everyone else shouted them down, preferring to try and appease Hitler or turn a blind eye to his growing power and influence. And as they dithered and endlessly talked, the nation became ever more powerful and ever more threatening.There is a very real danger in the same thing happening again. This is why they stompedon Saddam Hussein. Had they not… I believe his regime would have unleashed a large scale war that would have cost inconceivably more death and misery. I hear and understand the sentiment behind bringing the troops home, minding our own business and letting the rest of the world go suck a fart. But there are legitimate business interests abroad, legitimate alliances and friends and some of them ARE worth defending.Unfortunately, both parties lack the wisdom to distinguish between those that are, and those that aren’t. In geopolitics, sitting on your hands and doing nothing is like doing something. Hopefully Blumpf can rectify this.

A survey of surviving British WWII veterans from some years ago found that most of the respondents believed, in hindsight, that the war was not worth the effort, with many stating that they would have refused to fight, given their present knowledge, or would even have rather fought for Germany rather than Britain.

                The Germans  literally were planning on killing tens of millions of Europeans including the British.
The Italian fascists,allies of the Germans, were nervous about their fate in the event of a German victory.
The Germans were not white nationalists, they  were German nationalists who despised other whites.

            You’re right . . . it is a tremendously unpopular viewpoint because it is tremendously incorrect.  Nazi Germany’s goal was to restrain communism, against which the “All Lies” united to make the world safe for communism.  Ironic that, after joining forces to defeat the foe of communism, the US suddenly decided that communism was threat.

                Spot on, c matt, National Socialism is to defend the nation, International Socialism is to attack and undermine it.
To say that the Ostplan was like death camps for Catholics is like claiming the Tommys want to exterminate the Frogs. Muttering and shaking your fist while glaring across the Channel is not zyklon showers.
The Nazis knew darn well what hard-headed bast*ards the Slavs and Poles could be, and didn’t woo them with chocolates, but they didn’t use torture and degredation like the Ethnic Kommisars did.

                Meh. I’ve been called worse by better people.😂👍 As always i must reserve the right to be wrong. I’m a last wave boomer and my programming and indoctrination still gets the better of me from time to infuriating time.You guys are all right of course – at least to some degree. But…I wonder what an alternative history would look like? America came out of that clash of empires incredibly well. And – I dunno if it’s 1939…yet…it certainly felt that way, sometimes. When Biden was filling the govt with jews, cronies, perverts, and DEI flunkies…you could make the case that Weimar America was definitely coming down the pipe. And had not Trump put a stop to it…you can bet someone strongly resembling You-Know-Who would come along and do the job.But America is not Germany… could this current state of polarization give rise to a civil war, possibly? I love that rump is out there breaking the left’s toys…but I personally wonder how long they take it before they react? It may yet be that some form of American fascism may be needed to deal with the left

                        Undoubtedly, we ended up as their janissary to spread Democracy and Barbies around the world. The USSR ended up as their janissary to spread Communism.
I think Filthie’s instincts are telling him that if a You-Know-Who arises, is will be firmly from the Left. After all, they have Castro Lite up north.

                    I am impressed that you recovered your fumble in that scrum. It usually takes me a week to figure out I might have not been entirely spot on.It took me years, not weeks, to accept that the sociopathic Jewish power elite won the war. Germany could not be allowed end Bolshevism in the Soviet stronghold, which was likely in their plans.Churchill made a brilliant statement on Jewish power and its seditious nature right about 1920. After his financial ruin in 1929 Jews, with great prescience (give credit), kept him afloat. He became an advocate and Zionist.Anti-communism is anti-Semitism–The Jewish voiceI care not what puppet is placed on the throne of England to rule on which the sun never sets.

                    A future no-shit civil war is no laughing matter and can’t be dismissed as impossible. They seem unlikely in (relatively) good, normal times. But in not-so-good, abnormal times…
