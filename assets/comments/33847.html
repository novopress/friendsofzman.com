        From the 1980s until the early 2000s, I considered myself a staunch Israel supporter. Support for Israel was one of the pillars of “conservatism,” and I was a young Reagan Republican.The cartoonish Arab crazies like Yasser Arafat and Moammar Qaddafi made it easy to support the Israelis. Arafat in particular was like caricature of an Arab terrorist right out of a comic book. Qaddafi blew up 747 over Scotland, and we bombed him in response. The “Arab street” was full of fanatics ululating and chanting and carrying on. And of course I vividly remembered the Iran hostage crisis which I followed daily as a 14-year old, and Carter’s impotence.By contrast the Israelis seemed efficient, intelligent, articulate, and modern. It was difficult not to support them over the Arab nutjobs. It was also true that in the 1980s, the Jewish-controlled three-network media went out of their way to give Israel favorable treatment and portray the Arabs negatively. I watched “60 Minutes” religiously as a kid without knowing that “Mike Wallace” was a Jew (sounded Irish to me!) or that Morley Safer was a Canadian Jew.The Jonathan Pollard affair gave me my first doubts. Why would our Jewish allies spy on us? But it still took many years to become redpilled on the JQ.Education played a large role in becoming redpilled. George Washington’sFarewell Addressseemed like it had been written specifically to warn us against our involvement with Israel. So did John Quincy Adams’s foreign policy statements.Studying the history of the world wars of the 20th century made me understand that the Jews were not as innocent as they portrayed themselves. Sure, Hitler committed atrocities against them, but communist subversion led by Jews was a genuine threat in post-WW I Europe. And contrary to the media narrative, the Allies did not go to war against Germany to save the Jews, they went to war because they were imperialists.Studying religion, particularly after 9/11, made me realize that the Jews were just as homicidal and expansionist as the Muslims. As a Christian, I side with neither.Finally, sheer Zionist fatigue caught up with me. I have been following politics for almost fifty years and every single president in that time has had some sort of plan “solve” the Arab-Israeli conflict for “peace in the Middle East.” It hasn’t happened. Why do our leaders spend more time worrying about the West Bank of the Jordan than the West Bank of the Mississippi?Once you start “noticing” things, you can’t “un-notice” them. Thirty years ago I never thought I’d hold these views, but today I am fucking sick of Israel and if I never heard a single word about Israel or Jews ever again I’d be better off for it.

            Well said.  In light of recent revelations though, I would make one edit: Qaddafi“possibly”blew up a 747 over Scotland.

                No proper evidence that it was Gaddafi.Plenty of evidence that the bomb was made by a Syrian for Iran in revenge for their plane being shot down by USA.

            This is also similar to my path to being disinterested in the latest jewish emergency we must get involved in.I think if memory serves me correctly Truman wrote in his diary that he had doubts about how the Jews would handle the affairs of their new nation and how we might be drawn into Israels affairs?Well here we are.I wish Israel and the Jews well, I just do not want their lobby with so much influence in my nations affairs.I welcome these changes that may be coming.

                Modern Jews are the dog that finally caught the car. They functioned best as a specialized tribe within other nations. When they finally got their Zion and had to run their own state and do all their own work, well, things didn’t go so well. Becoming dependent on the US military to fight their battles has totally corrupted both nations and has a good chance of leading to a world war that will end modern civilization. It’s hard to overstate what a disaster Israel is for the world at large and even its own people.

            Well said. My turning point was about 10 or 15 years ago when I learned that Holy Land Christians mostly side with the Palestinians. In fact, most of them consider themselves Palestinians. That revelation as well as trolling about it on these message boards and the ignorant reactions I was getting about how it was all lies (it wasn’t) was the source of my red pill.(There is a serious side to my trolling. I argue on the internet for fun, but at the same time, arguing things out helps clarify my thoughts and opinions while having fun with it at the same time.)Since I became enlightened on this subject, my argument has been, why should I do things that advance the interests of the Jews and harm the interests of my fellow Christians? My tribe is Christianity, not Judaism. Likewise with this pogram the Jews in in our government are on against Russia. Maybe the Russians are the boogeyman for the Jews, but they’re not my boogeyman. I didn’t like the Soviets, but then again, the Soviet Union was also their creation.

                “My tribe is Christianity,”  It shouldn’t be.  There are “Christians” all over the world who aren’t us, don’t think like us and wouldn’t lift a finger to help us and might even rob us if given the chance.
My tribe is Northwest Europeans and White people.  I’ll side with an atheistic European over an African Christian any day of the week.

                    That’s a decent point, but it’s all relative. When the question is do you drop a bunch of bombs harming your fellow Christians for the benefit of a group that is non-Christian, I know what my answer is going to be. Those Middle Eastern Christians aren’t going to be that much different than Southern Europeans, by the way. Palestinian Christians are fine people.

                        I don’t disagree with that part.  I just don’t think it should even enter our minds.  If Israel was doing what they do without our help or money, I’d just say “well, one group of foreigners killing another group of foreigners. Ain’t my problem!”  Hopefully, I would never even hear about it.Sadly, this is not the state of affairs.  I’m sure there are many Palestinians, Christian or Muslim who are very fine people.  I wish them no ill will. I vehemently oppose supporting Israel’s wars, Gazacide and ethnic problems.  Our support of Tel Aviv has made us enemies around the world.  Unfortunately, my thoughts carry no more weight than yours or anyone else around here.

                        I’m not foolish enough to believe that just because an individual is White that means they are a good person or someone who I might consider a friend if I got to know them.  But the likelihood I will find any individual a worthy friend is much higher of White people than say, African or Asian Christians.  Unlike the European, the African or Asian has ethnic considerations that either do not align with my considerations or are outright hostile to mine.

                    Thank you. Yesterday at mass, it was announced that there would be a second collection for Catholic Charities in order to make up for the shortfall created by the administration.I didn’t see one person put anything in the baskets as they were passed around. The priest had a look of disbelief on his face, but said nothing. I couldn’t make it to my regular Latin Mass, where such a thing would never happen.

If you think I feel that some SBC or Episcopalian house of ‘worship; that has the trans flag out front is my ‘tribe’ ….. you have another thing coming. I despise them as much as that other tribe in question – THEY are all the same ‘tribe’ as far as I am concerned.

            Israel has never been anything except South Africa on steroids…The Stern gang and others drove the British out of Palestine, raped and murdered many Palestinians so they could take over their homes and land, and have continued to do so based on ideology and a fictitious identity as the jews of the Old Testament…Israel abides by no treaties, will not extradite jewish criminals, and is a safe haven for anyone with money…It has a nuclear program based on know-how and materials stolen from the US under the LBJ regime…but denies that fact…Israel has gotten at least $2 trillion from the US government, and has wreaked havoc on our relations with others in the ME, just as Dean Acheson predicted….

Just as there are 10s of millions of Whites who agree with us, but we never hear from them.  If I thought the political and media class of White people represented White people as a whole, I’d be as anti-White as they are.

        Israel has universal health care while Americans struggle to pay for basic health insurance. Israel has a wall while Americans are told that walls are too expensive and it’s wrong to keep out foreigners anyway. The double standard is staggering. Our government shovels billions to Israel while giving the finger to middle America. This isn’t helping Israel’s cause.

            I suggest you take a gander at the photos of the Israeli hostages.  With the exception of that mother and her two red-headed children, not a lot of White skin.  To me, many of them looked indistinguishable from the Palestinians.  Seems Israels demographics may be changing just as much as AINO’s.

                That’s one reason the internet’s attention to Israel since 10/7 has so injured its reputation.The un-curated film we see is of people who are strikingly foreign, not only in appearance. We’re not restricted to the propaganda “girls of the IDF” (Russian girls) or to conservative insistence that Israel is an “outpost of the West.” Israel unfiltered is indistinguishable from its neighbor countries of Arab psychos—visually and behaviorally.I’m half a Jew, and the average Israeli doesn’t look or act likeme, let alone likeus.It’s not a country of Western settlers, not anymore. It’s not European, demographically or ideologically. It’s Israel, like in the old stories.They’re horror stories.

            Yep. Ever since the second half of the 60s the Left has viewed Israel as an oppressive white colonial state in lands properly belonging to the sainted wogs. For this reason, Israel had to be destroyed. Even many Leftist Finkels felt that way. It’s no coincidence that Boycott/Divest/Sanction took hold in academia, Leftism’s most complete and redoubtable bastion.

            I’ve often suspected that besides hatred of rural Whites, the obsession of White liberals with gun control is that they know that if they had a gun handy, they would feel a strong temptation to off themselves with it. It’s amazing how strong the “death urge” (what Freudians call Thanatos) is with post-Christian Whites.This is why I don’t feel much kinship with the shitlib Whites around me. I can’t say I like the Pajeets or Mexicans much either but most of them seem to be relatively normal, unpretentious people. They still don’t belong here of course but a lot of the reason they’re here is the voting habits of shitlib Whites (and Jews) in the first place.

            True, but Trump’s actions only prove Z’s case in a sense. Most of the country looks at Trump’s push against Iran as just bizarre. It has zero public support. Yes, it has 99% support from Congress, but the lack of public support is new. No one cares about Israel. In the past, the American people would have generally supported Israel regardless of the situation.
Even Israel understands this, which is why it wants to use its golem while it can.

                    Untrustworthy people tend to have low trust in others.
You do get the feeling though that the Israelis/Jewish community have no Trump card (pardon the pun) on Trump. Yes, he seems to be a MIGA type, but they don’t seem to have any blackmail material on him nor does he need their money. He can make his own decisions and that scares them because they would backstab another group at the drop of a hat.

                        Good point, a lot of that poll can be explained by projection. A con man thinks everyone is running a con. Trump doesn’t have Jared and Ivanka chirping in his ear this time around which has to be an improvement.  That he was able to staff his administration with people who are mostly loyal to him had to limit the access the Israeli lobby has in the White House.

US foreign policy is religious zealotry, and a zealot will never be satisfied. Jews are just con men.

                        The talk/action dynamic turns up all over. He never said a word about USDAID. He has still not said anything about it, but he eliminated it. There are so many issues like this that it cannot be dismissed.

                            Dismantling USAID is the kill shot to the head of the snake.  Hopefully.
It may be that the justification for his whole first term was to learn about the centrality of USAID.
I follow politics closely and I don’t remember every hearing about USAID.
How ’bout you, Z Man or others, did you know of the centrality of USAID?

                                I am not sure if I wrote about USAID, but I did some shows on the Blob, focusing on parts of USAID like the Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute. On one of the shows about the neocons I talked about NED, which gets the bulk of its money from USDAID.
Frankly, I figured I was maybe one of a handful of people who understood anything about the not-for-=profit labyrinth that I call the Blob. Turns out that some of that handful had Trump’s ear.

                        “Easily 2/3 of jews were fervently anti Trump before he returned to DC”.They actually voted 4-to-1 against Trump last Nov.  And that has always been my problem with “them”.  It’s not that they wear small hats, or have big noses, or claim to be the chosen ones.  No, I loathe them because at their core they are overwhelmingly leftists and have the money and influence to spread their poisonous ideology across Western (White, Christian) nations as they have been doing for at least the past 100 years.  It’s not about anti-semitism, it’s about anti-leftism.  As with all hard-core leftists, there’s a special place in hell for them.

                            You are mistaken to classify the chosen as a subset of leftists.
First, giving hundreds of billions of dollars and weapons to Israel is not leftist.
Second, the right wing j3ws are just as likely to be for massive non-white immigration as the left wing ones. They tried to make functionally open borders a conservative value.
They are their own kind of subversive parasite group and try to turn all parties towards their own ends. If we overlook that, we will be tricked by them once again.

                                I believe Boris was referring to American and perhaps European Jews, not Israelis. And it is unquestionably true that this group is and long has been in the Leftist vanguard. The fact that rightwing Israeli Jews successfully bilk AINO out of billions of shekels doesn’t alter that fact.

                                    My point is that if you think fighting leftism is sufficient to fight subversion by the chosen then you will be unpleasantly surprised by what you overlooked.
Like the paleocons getting defenestrated by the neocons.

                                            That’s correct, Ostei. Thanks.LITS – my point was that if we are  fighting leftism we are essentially fighting not only the in-your-face mob we see everyday in the streets, in our work places, in our schools but also the behind-the-scenes “blob” that funds and directs the mob/the hive.  The blob directs the mob. And we all know who the blob are.  Think George Soros, think Zuckerberg, the Nulands, and tens of thousands of nameless, faceless foot soldiers that carry (maybe literally) the suitcases of cash that fund said mob. Maybe the best analogy would be a comedic one (or was supposed to be one) from the original Blues Brothers movie when the IL not-sees were marching in Skokie:“White men, white women….The jew is using the black as muscle against YOU, leaving you there in the middle helpless.  Well, what are you going to do about it, Whitey?”Indeed, what ARE we going to do about it?

            They’ve certainly been over the top with the Israel support. I sometimes wonder if that’s a deliberate attempt to get the public’s attention focused on our “special relationship”.
Israel has always gotten special treatment from USG, but it’s largely been out of sight, out of mind.
Now Trump is being visibly led by the nose by Israel, and not only isn’t he attempting to camouflage it, he’s pushing it right up in our faces.
That can’t possibly sit well with public opinion, and Trump surely has to know that. What’s going on here?

                    After October 7th 2023 there began to be all sorts of delays in Trump’s myriad court cases. It was obvious that the call went out to put everything on ice until the best candidate could be located, and naturally, it was the guy looking at the 80-year prison sentence and the seizure of most of his property.

                Offhand, I can’t think of any of our actual treaty signatory allies getting caught with their hand in the cookie jar stealing military and state secrets.
For Israel, “our greatest ally”, not only is it routine, our government issues pardons and repatriates them.

He probably thinks he can brazen it out. Sensitivity to the feelings of the public is not his strong suit and arguably it doesn’t matter. His base is probably indifferent to it and I hear that even mild dissent in the MAGA base is no longer allowed. This aside, he is so owned by the Israel Lobby, he may not have any latitude in what he says and does.

            China has recently stated that if Iran is attacked they will back Iran.  They did not specify military support but there are lots of ways they can support Iran.
The Russians have a defense pact with Iran.   They have pretty much said that if Iran attacks any party they will not necessarily come to their aid.   But, if Iran is attacked they have an agreement to assist them.  If the assistance only turned out to be air defense, that would still be huge.
One wonders if Trump considers such things.

        Z is right to allude to tectonic plates. The changing demographics and the fading of the WWII mythology are unstoppable forces moving against Israel and its dominance of US foreign policy. Young people look at the events of WWII (if they look at all) as they would Caesar’s Gaul campaign. Or, even worse for Israel, as a young white would look at some long ago fight b/w China and Mongolia.
Young Americans are separated from WWII – from which Israel and Jews in general get their moral authority with Boomers – by time and race. That will only get worse.

            Yes. And all demographics are against Israel, including their own. The religious Jews who won’t fight in the IDF are the fastest-growing cohort in Israel. Now Iran has 80 million people. Egypt has even more. When I ask my Jewish friends what the plan is for Iran, the answer is: “We attack them, [some magic occurs], the Iran problem is solved.” Jews are very smart and pragmatic, but like everyone else they are vulnerable to magical thinking when facing intractable problems.

                Yes, the demographics in Israel are an issue. A lot of Jews point to Israel’s birthrate with pride, but they never mention that it’s the orthodox and not the Ashkenazi having most of the kids. Compared to the rest of the world, secular Jews have a pretty good birth rate of 2.0. But religious Jews in Israel have a birth rate of 4 and the Haredi have a rate of 6.5.The Haredi are 13% of Israel now but will be 16% by 2030, which means that the under 40 population will be ~25% Haredi. (They’re already 20% of students.)The Ashkenazi are ~30% of the population but probably 20% of the young people. The Mizrahi are ~40% of the population and probably a bit less of the under 40 crowd.What will Israel be like as the Ashkenazi lose their grip on power or will they try to hold that power despite being a shrinking minority.

                I remember reading, probably here, that Eisenhower went around asking American soldiers if they knew why they were fighting. 90% said they had no idea. I expect that the other 10% were the dumbest decile who thought they fought for ‘democracy’. So, add ‘why’ to ‘when’ and ‘what’ and thus it ever was for we Merkans.

            Blackmail is part of it.  But the real influence is the money that flows from US taxpayers to our politicians, laundered through Israel, and thousands of NGOs along the way.  Support for Ukraine in Congress is built with this same template.

                This. It is pathetic and sad how amenable to bribes United States senators and congressmen are. As we are learning via USAID, all foreign spending ultimately is domestic spending and theft. Israel was an early adopter of the bribery model but it has competition now and may no longer be the top dog. If the money gets right, federal legislators may in time decide “who we are” wear turbans rather than yarmulkes. Also watch for which nation follows the Ukraine in the money laundering department; my money is on an Asian nation that suddenly needs protection from China and whatever perversion follows Drag Queen Story Hour. Some of the most important things Trump may be doing is plugging the hole in the USS Grift.

It may not even be bribes. They will be unseated by pro-Zionist money supporting other candidates should they take a critical stance towards Israel. There are several such examples. The USA has a pay-to-play political system.

            I think blackmail is certainly part of it, but I also think it’s as simple as money and comfort. All these guys get AIPAC money, but it’s not just the money, it’s the connections, the free trips, the “benefits” of those trips, the endless money that flows even after you leave Congress.And at some point the system self-selects for this. People who aren’t willing to play ball just don’t bother getting started in it. Yea, Mossad might videotape that fun time you have with the hired help in Tel Aviv, but it’s not like you don’t want to be there and aren’t enjoying your time there.

                    Well, the system is set up to filter those people out long before they get near DC, and is very good at that – because unseating someone is expensive, time-consuming, and risky (see Jamaal Bowman’s race).
They had to go and get rid of a few people who showed a glimmer of a conscience after witnessing Israel’s insane behavior in Gaza, but that is not the normal order of operations.

                    Yes. The goy cow will be milked harder and harder as the sympathy dries up. Even people outside of this sphere have started to notice how bizarre it is that Holocaust Museums are built in Western countries that sided with the communists and Jews against the Axis, that the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews never help the former while they are being ethnically cleansed, etc. And it is hard to play the victim card while engaged in genocide.

Has there ever been a place on earth more welcoming and hospitable to Jews than Florida? Maybe New York? How many people from Florida died in the Western Front? Why do we need so many of these museums and memorials paired with the usual goy-blaming?

                            I never thought of it before, but the increasing Jewishness of that state might be a reason why it has also been falling out of favor with people. Places like Arizona and the West are increasingly popular for retirement these days. Makes me wonder if the non-Jewishness of these places is one reason why.

        You know it’s bad when even a commenter who is as pro Trump as the Zman has been the last couple months calls the Trump admin’s support for Israel cartoonish. We aren’t even 3 months in yet and MIGA is a meme even on the right. In light of this, it seems a little ironic that Daily Wire’s USAID money was cut off. Incompetence, perhaps.

        I used to read and post on Instapundit. I’ve been kicked off of that page so many times I’ve lost count. It has to be dozens over the last 10 or 12 years. The reason I get booted from there is because I’ve always been critical of our greatest ally and more recently the Ukraine propaganda in my own snarky and mocking smartass way. More recently, I’ve been back bragging about how I was right about Ukraine (and Q) and how they’re just a bunch of normie suckers who lap up whatever propaganda they are fed. 😂Other times, I just create a new account and get back on. This time, I decided I’m bored with the page and I’m not going to make the effort.Glenn Reynolds said his ad revenue is down and I can’t help but think that a main reason is because that page attracts a bunch of neocon Israel simps and that worldview is falling out of favor, not to mention the half dozen stories having to do with the Jews or Israel he links everyday. It really is tiresome.If you’re Jewish, I completely understand where you would be pro-Israel. What I can’t understand is these Protestant Uncle Toms waving the Israel flag while warring on fellow Christians. If that’s not the very definition of being an Uncle Tom, I don’t know what is.

                Jews love saying that because they are desperate to tether our fate to theirs.  If you monitor pro-Israel tactics, you’ll notice their favorite thing to do is to say the we (Christians and Jews) are in this together, for Western Civilization or Judeo-Christian values or some other BS manipulation tactic that only ends with Christians giving their blood and/or treasure for Jewish interests.

                Only when speaking to a gentile audience. Don’t kid yourself and think that’s what they say when the rubes aren’t around. It’s also funny how they invented the phrase to put their ethno-religion first. People might say that’s because the OT comes before the NT, but they’d be surprised to find that even devout Jews are about as Biblically literate in the OT as a Sikh is. Their primary book, the Talmud, is younger than the Bible by a few centuries and almost as new as the Koran.

        I suspect that someone pulled Trump aside a year or two ago and said, “Your choices are 1. die in prison, or 2. if you get reelected, let Israel pick your foreign policy team”.  I don’t remember him being this over the top-ly pro-Israel the first time around.
Also, it’s funny that Trump has made such noises about releasing the full unredacted JFK assassination and 9/11 files while at the same time being willing to fully support and assist with Israel’s murderous criminal rampages.  Surely he must see the contradictions.

            I think this is the right take. Trump would probably love to free himself of their influence, and that is our greatest hope. However, unless Michael Waltz is fired and replaced by, say, Michael Anton (Sorry, Z), I think there will be a war with Iran and the Ukraine war will continue, more or less unabated.Additionally, they are well aware of the coming demographic and infographic realities. If there is a conflict with Iran, I expect that will be an excuse to codify the ludicrously broad IHRA definition of antisemitism into federal law, and anyone deemed in violation will be deplatformed, at the very least.It will be challenged, but whoever does will be labeled a “terrorist supporter”, especially after the now standard and perfunctory false flag.

        The possible fly I see in the ointment is Trump blabbing about “bad things” happening to Iran re their supposed nuclear program.  Apparently, military assets are accumulating at Diego Garcia.  I find it hard to believe we’d actually attack Iran, even at the behest of our “greatest ally”, especially when Trump is pushing so hard for peace in Ukraine.  While I’d love to see it fade away, that damned country just won’t.

                “Whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad.”My vague impression is that Trump does not move serious assets around when he is blustering. This would suggest that Trump is making a credible threat on the assumption that Iran will fold and allow the old restrictions to be put on a nuclear program that they do not have. Which would make Trump look good and ostensibly avoid a war in his mind.The first problem is that Trump is not acting in good faith, even to the extent he likely thinks he is. This concession will be the first of others that conditions Iran to bend the knee to their new Zionist overlords.Second, Iran has no reason to believe Trump is acting in good faith. The latest bombing of Yemen is just one more example on a long list of examples. They will be loathe to concede anything at this point, and possibly have some inkling of the submission this move would entail.Third, if Iran, backed by Russia and China, bends the knee to America, then Islam submits to Zionism. Islam will not accept that. You would likely see a few more bloody regime changes that America strangely does not approve of and then Turkey becoming the new Iran. Erdogan would be thrilled.Fourth, Trump cannot back down from Iran if Iran refuses his “sensible” threat. Trump’s bluff necessarily becomes Trump’s air strike most probably becomes Trump’s war with Iran.Fifth, Iran is waiting to be hit again by Israel or America, in order to secure world and Russian support, before they retaliate for the last set of Israeli air strikes. It is a “True Promise III”.Assuming Trump is not just laying pretext for a war with Iran he has already agreed to. We never start wars, you see. It is always those other bad people being bad and unreasonable. As we all know, WMDs are terrible things, and they can never be allowed into the hands of those bad people. That would be very bad.The bluster then becomes the frenzy of the faithful, surrounded by a group of zealots, living in a city devoted to that one peculiar god over all others. Onward to the Righteous Crusade. The Jihad to end all Jihads. Onward to The Glorious Future and The Promised Land.

            Every other goal of Trump – bringing back manufacturing, getting the 10-year rate down, attacking the Blob, etc. – gets blown out the window w/ a serious attack on Iran. Oil immediately spikes. Bond yields spike. Stock market dives. And that’s just from an air attack.
The US simply can’t afford to attack Iran in any way that disrupts the flow of oil. The Israeli Lobby is extremely powerful, but it’s not as powerful as the bond market.

                    Nobody is as powerful as the bond market. Jews can’t blackmail or bribe the bond market. Sure, they could get the Fed to pump money into the system or Congress to do something, but that creates other issues.
If the bond market turns against you, it’s over.

                Agreed, except I think bonds would rally on recession fears and flight to quality. That said, our Overlords haven’t thought through the second-order effects of such an attack. This assumes it even works –  it’s the most telegraphed attack of all time. Meanwhile, our foreign policy is: “if you try to get nuclear weapons, we will attack you. If you don’t, we will regime change you.” And we’re amazed this doesn’t create peace on earth.

                    An oil spike means both falling stocks and inflation. Btw, tax receipts are now tied to stock performance.
Bomb Iran = higher inflation &amp; stock market crash
Higher inflation = higher bond yields
Falling stocks = lower tax receipts
Lower tax receipts &amp; higher yields = more bond issuance to make up the gap and pay more interest costs
More bonds = higher interest rates
Higher rates = more bond issuance, recession and falling stocks
All of those = lower tax receipts &amp; higher spending = more bond issuance
Etc.

        If the events of 10/7/2023 occurred in 1998, then there would be monuments to the forty beheaded babies in major American cities by now. That lie more than any other made people seek out alternative sources. Then we got to see Israel’s horrific actions in Gaza and also see our horrible government officials suppoorting all of it. The Netanyahu speech might be the most shameful and craven display ever seen in our Congress and that is saying something.I am frustrated that Trump is wasting his political capital deporting people who criticized Israel and restarting a bombing campaign that already failed when Biden did it. It’s actually totally pathetic. It’s totally pathetic because Trump clearly knows waht needs to be done to save this country, he’s just not doing it because AIPAC and Miriam Adelson want him to be doing this. We need mass deportations and are getting ICE spending all their time and energy finding anti-Israel protestors.

        Ben Shapiro’s tweet that he didn’t give a “good damn about the so-called browning of America” came back to bite him, and it bit him good.In the 2015s, a notorious online trolling tactic back when The Federalist, NRO, and everybody else had open comment sections was to point out that if you love Israel and want the US to keep supporting them, you need to halt all non-white migration to the US as the levels of support for Israel among the “Global South” is at or around 0% (with the exception of Indians, who are shameless in their groveling to anybody with power whose coattails they can ride).Cut to today. Support for Israel is basically down to white boomers, the weirdos who still go to John Hagee, etc.’s Biblically illiterate weekly Sunday apocalypse conventions, and the handful of “young Republicans” who are getting groomed by the Hoover Institution and other think tanks as the next generation of pro-Israel political pundits (they should be careful…look what we did to Charlie Kirk from haranguing him for a few years). Below the age of 50, brown people hate Israel. White people, with the exceptions of the armageddon-desirers and the Brooks-Brothers-wearing Con Inc. cutouts, fall into 3 categories. A: They hate Israel because they hate colonialism due to programming. B: They hate Israel because they can’t help but notice who’s behind all of the programs destroying their country. C: They’re ambivalent to Israel as a concept but are angry that things are falling apart in this country while we’re hosing down a country the size of NJ with greenbacks that would be better spent fixing potholes we drive into every day.As an amusing anecdote, I read somewhere that over 60% of Israelis have bad allergies towards olive trees. Seems like they picked a bad place to live.

            I think Trump’s Israel support has several reasons.  First, yes financial.  Second, he has probably bought into the “chosen people” belief that these are biblical Jews.  Third, he is somewhat Reagan-like in his foreign policy and sees them as allies.  Fourth, he may view it as a necessary evil to get other more important agenda items accomplished.  I don’t think he understands how toxic they actually are to his agenda.  What would be hilarious is watching the anti-Israel left do a 180 if he dropped his Israel support and agreed with them.

            I think that the percentage of Jews who can be fairly classified as “International Jews” using Henry Ford’s meaning has not been lower in 2 millennia. This does make those who are not IJ’s good people or friends or allies, but merely that they are choosing a different collective behavioral pattern. Most Israeli’s, for example, are not IJ’s according to the traditional classificatory label but they see us as and use us like food animals without any moral qualms, because according to their ethnonational culture that is what we (and everyone else) are.I think Pres. Trump is trying to solve the problem of the International Jew, at least as regards their malevolent behavior in America, but without actually publicly labeling them calling them out. I don’t see how the project has a hope in hell of working, but the effort has the effect of positively preconditioning the battlefield, so I am pleased with it even in failure.

        The US Air Force has a fleet of 20 B2 stealth bombers, of which only about half are airworthy at any time. Seven of these are now parked in Diego Garcia (at enormous expense) awaiting orders to bomb Iran. Is this a bluff or is it the potential trigger for WW3? And all of this is being down on orders from Netanyahoo. How far we have fallen.

            Short of dropping nukes, what can a few air strikes do to an ancient civilization, other than make them angry? Makes about as much sense as picking a war with Russia right on its border. Less even. At least there you’ve got some Ukrainian cannon fodder to use to bleed the Russians. So, my conclusion is bluff. Or nukes.

        Regarding those comments about Trump’s distractedly talking about nonsense, I can understand the frustration because I share it.  But I don’t see the other work stopping, waiting for him to bring it up in public.  Z-man said the more Trump talks about something the less likely it is to happen, and I think this is so.  But what soes happen is the enemy media spins around in circles like mad, reacting to every silly thing he says.I don’t believe in 4D chess but I do believe in distracting an opponent then smashing them from an unexpected direction.  Trump can act as a giant walking distraction, which he seems to enjoy.   Meanwhile the boring but vital work is done by the boring but vital people.  Then one day, boom – USAID is gone and the world is changed.  Or the Education Dept is winding itself down.  Or whatever amazing, heretofore unthinkable, thing happens.  It’s been stunning to see actual progress for the first time in my life.   Maybe Trump is the big blowhard Boomer dumb-dumb we see, but I don’t care.  We just had 4 years not knowing who is in charge, and it was all bad.   Maybe the new invisible handlers are what we need, and can give us a few years of good things.We’re less than 3 months in and the world has changed.  What will it be like a year from now?  I choose to be cautiously optimistic.

        “Israel is a small country. Naturally, it cannot remain at the top of America’s priority list. Furthermore, the Israel Lobby represents only a tiny fraction of the American public.”You are taking way too sanguine a view of the supposedly declining influence of the Israel Lobby. These days I have to preface my remarks by stating I’m not an anti-semite nor making anti-semitic remarks. With this administration, an anti-Israeli genocide stance has been openly conflated with anti-semitism and is serving as the basis for governmental actions outside the law and certainly outside any precedent. The Israel Lobby owns Trump lock, stock, and barrel. As for public opinion, it simply doesn’t matter in this pay-to-play system. Ron Unz has a good recent piece out, which is well worth reading:https://www.unz.com/runz/the-zionist-destruction-of-american-higher-education/In particular this passage stuck to my mind:“These incidents seem to suggest a rather peculiar situation. It appears that American elected officials will regularly be removed from office if they are deemed insufficiently loyal to a certain foreign country, hardly the sort of governmental framework usually discussed in our political science textbooks.”

            They are as likely to have originated from Phoenicians, the colonizers of the Mediterranean, who perhaps converted to Judaism and intermarried with Europeans and North Africans. This could explain their mercantile instincts, which the ancient Hebrews were remarkably deficient in. The Judeans of Jesus’ day, intermixed with Arabs, could be some of the same ones being bombed by today’s “Jews”. Curiously, the canonical origin story of the Jews is not too dissimilar to that of Mormonism or British-Israelism.

            I’ll settle that one with some simple history. The Northern 10 Tribes don’t exist and haven’t existed since they were conquered by the Assyrians. The Assyrians had a specific policy of how they delt with people who couldn’t be governed, even when granted autonomy. They’d yank their army back, roll through again, kill as many people as was logistically feasible, and take the rest to resettle in other areas as they marched back to wherever the army that got stood up to put them down was going back to. They also resettled the conquered region with other people from other regions who would be forced to intermingle with the handful of people left from the rebellious region. What was the end-product of this? The Samaritans. Isn’t it strange that the Judeans who occupied the area viewed their co-religionists as strangers and enemies? It’s because they were “half-breeds.”As for the Judeans themselves, they poked Rome in the eye one too many times and got shipped off to Babylon for the 2nd time. There’s also the story about the conversion of the Khazars. Supposedly all Ashkenazi’s DNA can be traced to 200 people from one village in the Pale. Their proclivity for inbreeding (something they delight in accusing rural whites of) has resulted in their preponderance of medical maladies like Tay-Sachs, schizophrenia, hemophilia, and tons of other things.One thing’s for certain. On the few occasions when they crack open the Torah and start reading about David, they’re not reading about anybody like them.

        “The Israel Lobby foolishly aligned itself with the unstable elements of the left”A couple of years ago there was a TV commercial making the rounds on air, sponsored by some Israeli tourism board.  It featured two characters talking to camera as they were shown having no end of fun in the Not So Holy Land. The characters selling us on how delightful Israel is were two clearly homosexual males in their twenties, with freakish clothing, hairstyles and hair color; one of them was obviously intended to be “genderfluid,” with lots of makeup. Xhe looked like no one so much as the Only Gay In The Village character, Dafydd Thomas.https://littlebritain.fandom.com/wiki/Daffyd_Thomas

            Israelis in American media used to always be tough and pious, meant to evoke the Americans of the Old West. The boomer right has those Israelis in mind. I assume they’re like that on Fox, still. When “the left” thinks positively of Israel, it thinks of Tel Aviv: world capital of non-heterosexual perversion, as it proudly advertises.There are two Israels, one representative of its peoples’ heritage and one that’s just globohomo—which one could contend is simply rule by American Jews. The latter Israel was really “feeling itself” until recently, when 10/7 derailed its color revolution. Maybe that’s why it was allowed to happen.I don’t keep up with Moldbug types anymore. Do they argue that post-10/7 Israel is a model right-accelerationist state? Or do theyavoidarguing it? It might get a lot of /ourguys/ on board—at a cost.

        Another factor that you did not mention is that Israel has been thrashing round for going on 2 years in dealing with Gaza.  A poor city state.  Which make sIsrael look week.  Really week.Frankly, its pathetic. Very pathetic in a bd way.In the past Israel beat much larger aggressive neighbors in short sharp  wars lasting a matter of weeks. And as the saying goes, people follow a strong horse.But now, they spent 18months blowing up shit in Gaza and they basically havent made any progress on ending Hamas – which is just a bunch of thugs.Its a pathetic performance.  Bullying on one hand, ineffective on the other. Its weak and despicable.

            The Israeli citizen, I believe, has finally been prepared to exterminate Palestinians both west and east. What measures such a project would mean for Israeli Arabs I do not know. I had a long conversation with one Israeli woman who, only after a long conversation, let the final solution slip. But, they don’t seem to know how to do it, or perhaps agree on the means. 2.2 million in Gaza alone, and the Israelis know no one is foolish enough to take them in, leaving the final solution as the only option. I think they will run out of gas just as they did in 1948 when the original object was to run all Palestinians out of the region.Although, if the Israelis can trigger a nuclear or biological attack from its enemies, that could set them free for a lot of things.

        It used to be that Israel was the West’s tripwire on the frontlines of a dangerous frontier.
But, now that the enemy, Islam, is within our gates we don’t need her anymore.
As a security barricade, both Israel and NATO have failed us miserably.  Communism and Islam, just opposite sides of the same coin, have infiltrated our beloved European home, and now they sharpen their knives as they eye our North American retreats.
