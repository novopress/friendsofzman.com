        One of Z Man’s best posts in some time. If only it could be read and comprehended by the masses without short-circuiting critical thinking and activating their natural defense mechanism of cognitive dissonance. “You can’t talk bad about liberal democracy! What are ya, a communist?”

        In the era of the mass man, sociopathy becomes an accurate take on public life. What I mean to say is that the mass man (which incudes anybody to the extent that he is behaving as a member of the mass) is not a complete human being and extending human consideration to him only enables him to do more damage. The guy driving like an idiot on the freeway next to you, yammering away on his phone and disregarding the safety of everyone around him, may seem like a human being if you met him in another context, a person with a family and feelings and hopes and fears; but on the road he is simply an impediment to people who are trying to discharge some purposeful activity without getting themselves killed.This sort of widespread, asocial, callous behavior has grown so pervasive that the very human mass itself is now the single greatest obstacle to living the good life, and that is a dangerous situation. It means that many of the people out there are literally just wastes of skin. That’s something often said before, but not really taken to heart. But with things this tense, it’s only a matter of time until somebody does the cold calculation.It’s the sad fate of man that he must find his humanity not in limitless freedom but in just the opposite, in the stark recognition that everything has a cost and every decision has a consequence. It was not even two centuries ago that debtors were thrown in dungeons for a pittance and petty thieves were hung from a rope. Why? Because it was the only way to ensure accountability. People recognized then that if you take something of value from another, you are literally taking their life from them, stealing their time and effort that they will never recover. In today’s age of government sanctioned looting, we have gone as far as we can in the opposite direction. The next step must be a step back.But really, who would not a thousand times prefer a world of enforced accountability to the current mess?

            People realized that you were stealing their time and thus their life from them. They realized this because what little they had was of great value to them. Punishment for crime was also much harsher not just because of the apparent loss of time do to the theft, murder … Also, incarceration was a further loss of precious resources inflicted in the entire community that paid for it.I saw a story today where a feral punched and mauled a white female sheriff, took her gun and shot at her. This was in 2019. He was acquitted on all of the serious charges. The defense attorney displayed all of the socio/psycho-pathic qualities you described. He not only had zero remorse, he was strong in his conviction that he was correct in his defense. In a sane society he and other such lawyers would suffer the most vicious and applauded applications of capital punishment.This is made difficult by the unanimity of modernity. If he lived in a town where everyone knew him, if he dared such nefarious chicanery, he would be torn limb from limb by the town folk. Imagine the bleak psychopathy of the technocrat’s landscape of the megalithic megalopolis. The effect of the geography of the living arrangement is not to be underestimated.

                Funny coincidence department, but I was just reading about an incident early in the 20th century in Durant, Oklahoma where a nuggra fatally wounded a white women. The white men of Durant rose up, apprehended the nuggra, shot him to death and burned his body in the middle of the town. They also warned the other nuggras in the Durant area that they were all on very thin ice. In short order, they packed up and left.
If you are stuck with negroes, alas, this is the only way to deal with them. Accountability in spades.

                    Ostei:  You see this all the time in today’s crime reporting.  Someone will shoot and kill a blaq who is stealing his car or who has robbed a business or invaded a home.  The standard  hue and cry goes up: “Why did they have to shoot Donquavious?  It was ‘just’ a car/merchandise/personal property.  His life was worth more than your stuff!”  Blaqs value White life not at all, but one of their own is always worth more than Whitey’s ‘stuff,’ no matter how long or hard said White had to work and save for what blaqs casually dismiss as ‘stuff.’I, in turn, now value blaq life not at all.  They are not worth the noise, the chaos, the time, the danger.  They add nothing to our culture in general or any White life in particular.  I do regard them as a mere impediment I wish removed from my environment as expeditiously as possible.

                        My inner conservative still wants to protest, “What about the good blacks?  The ones at my job, the ones I knew at college, Thomas Sowell, Clarence Thomas?”
These blacks almost always side with their racial brothers when issues of conservative values are at stake.  Tim Scott introduced legislation to let more criminals out of jail, for example.
Tribalism commands deeper loyalty than values, at least for almost all non-whites.
It’s not worth the enormous effort that it would take to identify the non-tribal non-whites, and even then, their offspring will probably revert to their racial mean.

            I think our ‘Betters’ *have* already done the calculation. The thing is they’re not totally wrong about the Proles (but see 2 paras down).That Being Said™, to said Betters (sic) all present here are undifferentiated proles, too… and are marked for the bovine rail transports.You don’t have to be the late lamented Uncle Ted (I fully disavow his methods and totally support the State of Israel and it’s 6 Gorillion Genders for the record, cross my heart and hope to die) to sense that our present system is deeply sick and has produced a vile ruling elite (sic) which has done terrible things to Western native stocks. Most of the ‘useless mouths’ proles never stood a chance as the system gave them no positive guidance and worked overtime to pervert them.Still, Mother Nature and our baked-in human propensity for Mimesis will take care of all in good times. Interesting Times as the Han supposedly put it. FWIW I’ve never met a Chinese who has heard of the curse “May you live in Interesting Times”.

            Nietzsche in his “Genealogy of Morals” discusses the sometimes gruesome promises debtor made to creditor. I suspect the relatively modern euphemisms like “one’s pound of flesh” or “I’ll take it out of your hide” were once literal realities. In certain times and places, he argues, similarly draconian penalties were required to instill basic morality into the average man’s brain.

        Two telling examples of the failure to adapt the model to even a semblance of reality:1. LA County freeway lights. Most LA freeways are dark. Because copper thieves stripped the copper wiring from streetlights for scrap as in third world nations. Cal Trans won’t replace them, arguing its a waste of money as a few nights later the thieves will simply strip the copper wiring again; the legislature is set to force them to replace the wiring endlessly. Instead of just arresting the thieves with a “tune up” to adjust their attitude.2. Per the Midnight’s Edge YT channel, companies like Blizzard/Activision, Cracker Barrel, Chic-Fil-A, AB Inbev, Disney etc. are going full rainbow/woke because not only do they need their ESG/DEI score up to keep lines of credit from shadow banks like Blackrock, but they need their CEI index up which means a few rainbow employees can demand the companies go after their customers. It is mostly driven by ideologues like Larry Fink at Blackrock, who act as gatekeepers for financial resources and are as unstable as the various counts setting up giant fortresses in the Alps in passes to collect tolls. Same sort of thing, not stable. These companies are rapidly encountering trouble, Bud Light is a dead brand, Cracker Barrel and Activision and Chic-Fil-A are alienating core customers in a recession; Disney likely needs to sell off lots of assets* to meet the Comcast put on Hulu.None of this is stable. Have a third world transport system have a third world military capable only of third world force projection in Taiwan or Ukraine. Have companies going bankrupt or without bridge loans / lines of credit, they end up like Sears, K-Mart, TWA, Pan Am, etc. Most sane societies adjust the model when it fails, even if that requires widespread hypocrisy or abandoning former beliefs. That we have not is the stranglehold of financial institutions and leaders over everything else. [Much of the country is in open revolt over the Rainbow, the smart move would be to lead it not defend the Rainbow]

            To reply to my own comment, Disney at January 2024 has to buy out Comcast / NBC-Universal’s stake in Hulu. They acquired Fox’s stake when they bought much of Fox. Disney values that at $9 billion and Comcast says $25 billion.Per Midnight’s Edge, at current stock prices a mostly stock deal would hand Comcast about 15% of the company, more than Blackrock and Vanguard combined. Which would lead to at least 3 board seats. That’s a no-go. Disney has on any given month only 200-400 million free cash flow (outside of current liabilities). That means they have about 7 months to come up with about $10 billion to (most likely $15 billion) in cash.Can they get a loan? Sure, they have IIRC about $100 billion outstanding when they took out one during the Beer Flu, they no longer have that cash but still have the payments, roughly I think $5 billion per year. They lose about a billion per quarter on Disney + streaming, or another $4 billion a year. If they take out a loan now on current corporate rates they are looking at roughly 8.5% interest or around 1.2 billion annual payments on top of the existing $9 billion they must pay on past debt and streaming costs each year.They will have to sell assets to finance at least part of this, they don’t have the money to sustain the interest and streaming costs now; which means selling assets FAST (they must be complete by Jan 2024) which means some of: ABC, Lucasfilm, Marvel, ESPN. They need about $8 billion or so to get their yearly nut down to $600 million or so which is a sustainable outflow, if they sell off other assets (overseas parks likely) to pay down some of their current debt and cut back more on Streaming expenses.If you wondered how Sears, K-Mart, Pan Am, TWA, Radio Shack, etc. went out of business, this is it.

                Disney 2.0’s business model was built on a cable tv society, and for that it was superb, as the stock price reflected in the 90s and 00s. But as cable tv wanes, the model is failing. Parks are a relatively modest moneymaker which can’t support the bloated corporate edifice. Even if the movie studio branch was being run well, which it isn’t, it couldn’t either.Disney has to bite the bullet and part with espn and/or abc if it wants to free itself to have a chance to revitalize its movie business. Which would mean a return to Disney 1.0, with a corresponding loss of shareholder value. Only a retard would pay them anything substantial for Lucasfilm/Marvel. But there are a few out there I guess.Point being, as long as Disney’s corporate fortunes are married to cable TV, it will experience a corresponding decline.

        Liberalism isn’t required to evolve or progress, but progressivism is, it’s in the name. Is the latter just a name given to an impulse that became unrestrained by liberalism, as the Zman expressed in the straight line from abolitionism to rainbow flags?When it’s 40% of the population, and best as I can tell it’s something like that who approve of the Rainbow Republic, I don’t believe spiteful mutants is the best descriptor. NPC is probably better. They are just conforming to ruling class ideology, most of them. The exact opposite of a spiteful mutant, when you get down to it.When it began 20 or so years ago, was “Taste the Rainbow” the luckiest marketing slogan ever, or did Mars Inc. know what was coming? That’s an indicator of the imposition of a ruling class ideology, not spiteful mutants.

        Off-topic–I’ve been unusually quiet the past month and a bit prior because I was prepping for an extended road trip which I’ve been undertaking for almost a month now.I’m taking an eye level view of the country in real time vs. the packaged fake &amp; gay media version. I also wanted to see if anyplace sparked my interest as a place to put down roots. I’m about halfway across the US from the sewer of DC, Sodom on Potomac. Here is what I’ve found:We are being terraformed much faster than I expected. I think I had perhaps a naive or quaint idea that ‘flyover country’ as my neighbors the sociopathic beltway elite like to call it would also include cities full of White folks. Wrong! I moved quickly through the South on my journey knowing that it was the ‘original source’ of the biological weapon known as Africans released onto this landmass.  No surprises there. Knoxville, Memphis, Little Rock. They may as well be Baltimore City. Ravaged just as the joggers do everywhere they go.What -did- surprise me however was- Oklahoma City. Oklahoma City?! Surely that is a Whitopia, right? Midwest? Wrong! It’s a sh-thole. Tulsa, slightly better. Wichita, Hispania land. Omaha, NE– I mean come on? Nebraska! Terraformed. Less than 2/3rds white and falling fast.That open southern border that has allowed 30 million to cross in? I see where they land now. Reconquista isn’t coming it is here -now-. Any city where joggers haven’t destroyed the La Raza crew has planted roots. And while not as bad, they are not much better because these are not 2nd generation Cubans in FL. These are squatemalans who didn’t have anything but the shirt on their backs. No skills, maybe manual labor if you are lucky, and they are legion. Spread all across these mid-West cities little barrios as far as the eye can see.Major Blackpill for me. The in-between places all look the same. Whites, many with generational poverty just quietly soldiering on with no help and no hope. The entire trip so far, which I’m about halfway through has been eye opening and depressing all at once. It also sort of reaffirms my belief that the only true escape I’m going to find is back to whence my family came, Europa. My grandfather came here with not much too but managed to make a life through busting his ass, these new arrivals are on the government dole and they gladly take the gibs.I will continue my journey with future reports but we are far deeper down this brown and black hole then I realized now that I’ve seen it with my own eyes.All for now,AP

            The Biden admin accelerated the GR so that 2016 can never happen again. The R party accomplices managed to find a way to help out, while at the same time scoring political points for themselves, by shipping the mestizos all over. But it’s all much bigger than that.

            Yeah. I can confirm. Places in the middle of nowhere that you would think would be a time travel back to 1950s demographics, have little Mogadishus, little Khartoums on top of a significantly sized Guadalajara North. There will be no country.
It is one of the greatest crimes in human history being perpetrated here and in Europe. Swedish state TV is showing Swedish history that includes neolithic hunter gatherer Swedes as negros. If you head to Europe, choose wisely. Wherever you end up, have a tribe.

                Yeah I am having a hard time seeing Europe as a refuge for whites. There are still more of them relatively, for now, but all the same mechanisms and ruling class will are operating to reduce that, with resistance to it that is generally weaker and less effective than Trump was.

            Apex:  Agreed.  The rot goes very deep and is terminal.  There is no medium-sized city, of whatever state, where you will not find large and growing ethnic enclaves.  I would argue, however, that the same is true in most of Europe.  If you can work remotely (and your wife can live comfortably without lots of shopping and lunch outings), you will still find smaller rural areas that are still 80-90% White.  We recently relocated to one such and love the slower pace, hearing nothing but English, and seeing White faces.  But even here, the rot creeps in.  There was the mudshark I saw at the   Walmart, and the squatemalan family at the Aldi.  The numbers are miniscule compared with DFW, but even one is too many, and a harbinger of millions more to come.Best of luck in finding your safe haven.

            I wouldn’t be shocked if the country is majority non-white now. The Guatemalans are about the only group of invaders who live outside the urban areas in large numbers. They often are in crude shelters in isolated places. They do not appear to interact with others, including other Hispanics. From what I’ve seen, they and Mexicans in particular are quite adversarial. I’m not even certain the Squats outside the cities even get gibs.What has been done is catastrophic and breathtaking. Most invaders live in the cities and tend to form into rival groups. I suspect it will be impossible to maintain businesses and property in the urban areas in the near future. The places that remain almost exclusively white are the hardest hit economically: the lower Midwest east of the Mississippi, the Upper South east of the Mississippi, Appalachia, New York State, parts of the West, and much if not most of New England. These areas have their own problems although they are likelier to remain marginally functional.In Europe, there is a concerted effort to put invaders in outlying towns and villages and it is well underway. That is tougher in North America because the size makes it hard to track people and confine them.Pulling back:Get outside of the cities, find white enclaves, and be prepared to live a much more spartan life.

            A decade or so ago I returned to the little town in NW Georgia where I grew up for a family funeral. It was pretty much as I remembered. Small shops, diners and car repair. A 150 year old city hall and fire station combo and best of all, not a jogger in sight. The most whitewashed town you could imagine. I revisited just a couple of years ago and it was if a light switch had been flipped to open the gates of hell. Local packing plants had imported thousands of POC’s who now loitered everywhere. Mom and pop’s closed (wonder why) and everyone I talked to looking for a way out or just waiting to die. Heartbreaking. I imagine this being repeated all over the South.

        All the”-isms” run counter to human nature. They’ve been concocted by people with a superficial verbal intelligence and the gift of the gab — but these are people who can’t change the oil in their car. We say “conservatism” but it’s not really an “-ism.” It’s not something that can be spelt out in words and ideas but is rather something rooted in blood, land, instinct, and tradition. The hobbits in the Shire exemplify it, as do the people of Rohan. The “-isms” are created by the people in Isengard and Barad-Dur.

            Fundamentally, all government is a protection racket, which is intended to protect the actual producers from raiders…That is necessary and beneficial when that government largely sticks to that mission, but inevitably it doesn’t and it creates favored elites and secret police to prevent the commoners from interfering with the looting..Manorial feudalism, because of its decentralized structure, worked better than most systems, because the local rulers had an interest in the welfare of their serfs and servants…

            I can relate to a lot of that. I have a high verbal IQ and am good at talking but can’t change oil. In fact I can’t even change a tire. What makes me unique though is despite all this I am against the isims and can see what damage they do.

        Modern liberalism, as birthed by the French Revolution, is an inversion of the pyramid of human order.  According to nature, the fittest ruler comes along and crosses the Rubicon.  He may have children that reflect his nature, but even after a few generations that line is exhausted and a new line takes over.   In liberalism the lowest scum of the human condition locks together and elects a Robespierre who terrorizes on their behalf.  Eventually, you get a Napoleonic figure who restores the natural order.  If nature wanted the pyramid to be inverted, it would hav inverted it.  At no point in nature do the weakest of the species rule the roost.  The lowest forms of that life form are run off.Was Obama not a black Robespierre?

        Perhaps reality is always just what it is, regardless of the model.  Climate scientists come up with all sorts of models to prove their nonsense, but it’s obvious that the model doesn’t change the reality of what the climate actually does.The reality of human organization is to always establish a feudal hierarchy.  The most ambitious psychopath realizes he can convince his friends to band together and beat up anyone who doesn’t pay them a protection fee, then he won’t have to do any gross farming or mining.  Pretty soon the operation is large enough such that the original guys can’t personally go beat up all the peasants so they hire enforcers, and the system expands in a sort of pyramid scheme fractal way.  Then we make up stories to tell each other so that we don’t have to feel like we’re just slaves being milked.  “The Sovereign was appointed by God!” “The President has the mandate of the people!”  “If Chief Axthualapethaltec doesn’t stick a fish bone in his penis at the temple the sun won’t rise!”I suppose my explanation is itself a model and not revealed truth, but it does fit observations pretty well.  You would expect to see people higher on the pyramid not doing any useful work, spending all their time socializing with the purpose of scheming towards advancement.  I saw this at work pretty directly.  At the bottom you have the peasant engineers working all day.  Then above the base of the pyramid the management is just networking, going to meetings, taking credit for anything the engineers accomplish, etc.  Up at the top you’ll have a guy like Elon Musk who everyone insists works just SO HARD ALL THE TIME because merit, yet is paradoxically also able to spend all his time shitposting on twitter.If this is an immutable aspect of human organization, the best we can hope for is to stir the pot such that our guys become the mafiosos instead of the juice and kiddie fiddlers.

        Just as individual atoms do not possess temperature, individual humans do not possess culture.Nor are individual humans omnicompetent, which is what Western liberalism — a product of the late 17th century — presumes.Back then, even the most airy-fairy egghead was good with his hands, to an extent we find hard to imagine now, simply because they lived in a hand-built world. For rhetorical convenience, the “founders” of Anglo-Saxon liberalism were Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. Two more “intellectual” guys would be hard to imagine; they were the eggheads’ eggheads. But I bet Locke or Hobbes would be at least journeyman-level carpenters if you time-warped them in to The Current Year. They’d probably also be at least basically skilled farriers, blacksmiths, and so on. They probably did more actual physical labor in a day than anyone outside of the construction trades does in a week, if not a month… and these men were, effectively, professors!Back when I was teaching (and still believed kids wanted to / could learn), I’d encourage them to read books with titles like “Day to Day Living in Elizabethan England” (there really is one like that, though I forget the title). There are YouTube series on it too. Even if you were “upper middle class,” as those guys were, and didn’t actually have to go kill, skin, and cook your own dinner, you still had to roll out of bed thinking about how you were going to feed yourself, because food prep was an all-day process. Everything in a hand-built world takes tremendous planning and a lot of elbow grease, from “getting dressed” to “eating dinner” to “what we’d consider pretty technical repairs to your home, furniture, and clothing,” because nothing was standardized and nothing was machined. It took immense effort — actual sweat off your brow — just to get through the day.A government full of “pretty good at pretty much everything” guys can exist inside the liberal paradigm. Translate that to the rough frontier of America, and you’ve got a bunch of “truly extraordinary guys, who are good at everything and excellent at lots of things” designing a system that would work for them. The margin of error was pretty damn thin on the frontier, so omnicompetence was the rule.Not so much nowadays.

            Trivial anecdote, but its been nearly half a century since I’ve seen anyone thread a needle and sew a garment. As with the rotary dial telephone, I doubt anyone under 50 even knows what a needle and thread is. Yeah, but coding, IP, and AI are going to take us to the next higher level in our specie’s evolution. Fat chance.

                Weird side note: a big thing amongst the indie chick bands is making one’s own clothes.  During the lockdown, the girls discovered fabrics and sewing.
They are, after all, the punk scene, the dissidents.  That’s why they make pretty music, dissenting in their own feminine way from the vulgar, the harsh, the stupid ugly of the hebe-african studios.
These indie garage bands are all white kids, note.

        When I was in graduate school I was taught that marginalization of the subaltern (women and minorities, basically) was evil, and one reason the West itself was evil. Marginalization was a manifestation of the panoply of isms and phobias, which incidentally have multipled greatly since my time in grad school. Even though I was a rightwinger by the standards of grad students, I provisionally accepted this judgment.Alas, the very essence of my transition to the DR was the awareness that those peoples had to be marginalized, to one extent or the other, for the good of society. And now I’ve taken the next step, which is understanding that the better societies are those that simply do not have many subaltern groups–women excepted. Homogeneity–contra diversity–is the key. In homogeneous societies, there are no subaltern saboteurs, arsonists and vandals, and therefore no need for marginalization (coercion, in Z’s parlance).AINO is one of the most diverse nations on earth, and it is certainly the nation that has most stridently made diversity its national religion. And this fact, more than any other, is why AINO is utterly doomed.

            We’re not alone.There’s a plague of rats in Paris right now. The government is incompetent to address it and unwilling to name its cause (immigrants filling the streets with trash), so it’s making weird gestures, e.g., employing an environmentally friendly rat hunter with a staff of ferrets to kill a handful of rats each day.Even that offends the local left politicians, whose demands are that rats no longer be called “rats” (a Nazi term!) and that they be recognized as a marginalized population (literally translated from their protest signs: a “liminal minority”) and protected from the predations of the majority (white Parisians).This is not satire.

        Great post. The Clouds have acknowledged reality and broken with the model. Con Inc. clings to it.The other thing this model does is it holds as its definition/measure of the good as getting more money and higher GDP. Because of this it has no standards. Because it has no standards it can’t discern. Because it can’t discern liars and huckstersFinally, it holds as a chief virtue being conflict avoidant. I suspect that is a feature, not a bug. Because, someone will always step into the vacated space, conflict avoidance quickly becomes subservience to psychopaths.A civilization run by merchants and their financiers is a disaster. The scope of the catastrophe on our hands is difficult to fathom and too bleak to attempt to. But, we must stare into that abyss and give others the courage to as well. From there, the instinct to survive will re-emerge.

        To put it in Straussian terms (Gasp — “The horror!”) both communism and libertarian capitalism are modern political philosophies. In modernity, men rely upon  artifices — industry, materialism, government institutions — to overcome the inherent defects of Man’s nature and man’s inherent inequality.Strauss urged us to re-commit to the study of ancient and classical philosophy, in which there was a constant tension between the Platonic egalitarian ideal expressed by the guardian class in the Republic, and the hierarchical structure of human societies — free man, female, child, slave, animal — that Aristotle regarded as natural. Politics is the ongoing art (not the science) of adjudicating these competing tensions.Modernity is highly democratic and egalitarian. Democracy and egalitarianism exist in contradistinction to Aristotle’s natural hierarchy, therefore they are artificial and dependent upon being imposed by government coercion.The United States was not founded as an egalitarian democracy — it was founded by white male elites of English heritage. What is almost entirely absent from today’s ideological discussion is the element of magnanimity that animated the Founders — yes, they were wealthy elites, but they regarded themselves as having a duty to treat their inferiors as justly as possible. Think of a professional class in engineers or physicians who police themselves and maintain their professional standards. That’s what the Founders basically were. In Aristotle’s words, they were free men “governing and governing themselves in turn.” They recognized the relationship between the superior and the inferior as symbiotic and duty-bound, not exploitative and materialistic as you find in both Marxist and capitalist thinking.To call into question the modern ideologies of both capitalism and communism is to call into question modernity itself.

            Good post, Xman. But I do have a question about Plato’s putative egalitarianism. To wit, did it extend to non-Greeks? My understanding is that Plato believed only Greeks had the ability to accurately marry signs with the underlying Platonic forms and thus understand reality acutely. For this reason, the Greeks were, in a very real and important sense, superior to non-Greeks.

                Yes Aristotle specifically distinguishes between Greeks and “barbarians.”
On the “putative egalitarianism” of Plato, it’s important to remember that it was restricted to the Guardian Class, based on the belief that they could apprehend the Forms.
Indeed, today’s elites pursue a debased form of Platonism, in which they assume that women and Negroes are entitled to membership in the guardian class. A few, like Clarence Thomas, are — but the exception does not disprove the Aristotelian rule that Nature creates a hierarchy and that free white males are on the top.

                    I’m not going to bill myself an expert on Plato, but is it not possible that he meant The Republic as an exercise in speculation of a utopia, a thought experiment and not a serious inquiry into what would work in the real world?

                        Yes, very possibly it was a reductio ad absurdum. That does not make it a useless exercise in mental masturbation, though. Rather, it provides an endpoint or a telos toward which Man can strive. Man may not achieve it fully but by striving toward it he can move the football a few yards toward it.The best example of real-world guardian classes I can think of is the idea of objective, educated professionalism in areas like law and medicine and engineering and academia and so on. Of course today these fields have been debased by wokeness and affirmative action, but not long ago they really were competent and trustworthy and dedicated to the “forms” of their professions.Of course Plato himself discusses the debasement of the guardian class, to a military rule, then an oligarchy, then a democracy, and finally a tyranny. So even if he believed the guardian class was possible he didn’t think it was inevitable or going to last forever.Seems that we seem to be following the downward spiral he predicted rather accurately.

            That’s really apparent with the so-called “Ukraine aid packages.” It will never happen but an audit would be…interesting. It also happened with the Covid packages to a breathtaking degree. It is reasonable to assume the oligarchs are strip mining what they can and buying hard assets, likely abroad.

                    Wasn’t that a mini-sub-plot in goodfellas or one of those 90s mob movies?  They took over a successful club and then ran it into the ground doing things like buying booze on credit and selling it at a nominal loss and then burning it to the ground and collecting the insurance.It’s a good example of how the US economy works.  Take some once great brand, suck every last nickel you can out of it until it’s dead and then slap the brand label on whatever unbranded crap some Chinese corporation is making.   RCA is a good example of this.  It’s nothing more than a stylized font and logo for Chinese crap RCA used to make well.

        “Similarly, humans are not equal in ability, so there will always be unequal outcomes.”The Kurt Vonnegut short story “Harrison Bergeron” details a frightening future world that these egalitarian spiteful mutants envision for us all.“THE YEAR WAS 2081, and everybody was finally equal. They weren’t only equal before God and the law. They were equal every which way. Nobody was smarter than anybody else. Nobody was better looking than anybody else. Nobody was stronger or quicker than anybody else. All this equality was due to the 211th, 212th, and 213th Amendments to the Constitution, and to the unceasing vigilance of agents of the United States Handicapper General….”

            Love the nod to Vonnegut. I’ve been referencing that story for years. When I hear about “body positivity” and all the other fads that represent the elimination of standards, I’m often put in mind of “Harrison Bergeron.” Egalitarianism is the enemy of Excellence.

            I often see “Harrison Bergeron” mentioned enthusiastically by dissidents of various flavors. What I hardly ever see is their acknowledgment that Vonnegut wrote the story as a mocking parody of what he viewed as common ignorant objections to socialism – aka “IF THIS GOES ON”, spewed (as Vonnegut saw things) by frightened wypipo stuck in some phantom fifties pipe dream of Randian individualism and tradwife slavery. But Vonnegut was not a stupid man, and were he alive today I would hope that he would accept, however reluctantly, the fact that a great many of the theoretical objections he raised in his fiction were not only legitimate criticisms, but depressingly prescient.

                    Are you talking about Heinlein? Despite his allegedly “fascist” views, Heinlein is one of the most popular sci-fi writers among libertarians, check out the Prometheus Awards. I’ve read numerous books by both him and Vonnegut. Vonnegut was definitely a lefty progressive but also a realist, so I think “Bergeron” was a dig at liberal excess just as “Welcome to the Monkey House” lampooned Christian sexual morality.

            ArthurinCali:  I find myself suggesting this short story constantly and am shocked at how few have actually heard of it or read it.  It captures the equity aspect of today’s AINO far better than anything else.  Combine it with the surveillance state of 1984 and the communal and lotus-eater lifestyles of Brave New World, and you have today spot on.

            I think of Vonnegut in the same way as I do John Cleese and George Carlin.  You can productively mine their work for critiques of the left, but they spent most of their energy on tearing down the kind of society that most of us would like to live in.
As much as I love some of his work, John Cleese spent most of his career feeding the leftist beast that has now gotten around to eating him.

            Adam Smith’s legendary invisible hand. There’s doubtless some truth in it, but like scientific materialism, it fails to account for the fact that man is not merely homo economicus, and that wanton economic flourishing may do terrible violonce to things outside the economic purview.

            The free-market view of economics relies on simplifying assumptions similar to Ohm’s law. It assumes that the wealthy will practice enlightened self-interest and not use their money to purchase the use of force (that is, legislation) against their rivals. I say  “enlightened” because in the long run, economic cheating harms everyone, but few people can think that far ahead.

                Excellent insights. And here’s a core example of (in this case) free market economists failing to account for other factors. The stereotypical Enlightenment economist or philosopher imagining that all men would act in enlightened self-interest is, I’d argue, as ludicrous as the belief of Christians or other religious group that (on average) sinners will suddenly see the light and change their ways. Both those fail to take into account human nature, facts that are stumbling blocks to idealism of any stripe. Philosophers and others who argue for shiny, orderly worldviews would rather ignore the fact that Man is still an animal ruled by primitive instincts and drives little different from his ancestors a hundred thousand or a million years ago.Encapsulating this idea, I think it was Francis Bacon who noted (approx.) that we are beholden to Machiavelli and others who write what man does, instead of what he should do.

            We all like to thing in absolutes but alas, the world is not quite so accomodating. With the disclaimer that I’m (mostly) determinist/materialist, I recur to a quote from (of course) Nietzsche: “in real life it is only a question of STRONG and WEAK wills.” (Beyond Good and Evil, Book I, 21) Perhaps I quote him a bit out of context here but no matter. I’d argue that the error a Smith makes in claiming an “invisble hand” is of the same category that a Theist makes asserting it’s God’s hand controlling matters. Perhaps in the first case, it can be excused as a euphemism: there are hidden factors that, it’s claimed, produce an optimal outcome. The latter case implies a hidden diety pulling the levers.“The common good” also comes under suspicion. Yes, it exists, but only as a Platonic Form, it’s an abstraciton having no more physical reality than does a Triangle, Love, Harmony, Art or the elusive thing-in-itself. Maybe I’m mis-identifying what dad29 calls “horse hockey.” Those public and private choices exist, whether they are about morals or economic decisions. I do wholeheartedly concur, however, that it’s “magical” thinking that these would necessarily result in the best outcome. Another perspective is that even if there is some highly influential or controlling force (that Invisible Hand whether of homo economicus or God) in a system, it is still PART OF THE SYSTEM.Of course I’ve deliberately steered my arguments back to this, but doesn’t all this sound remarkably like a contest of strong and weak wills? Perhaps we’d like to think that the guys with the most votes, or the strongest army, are the “right” or the “virtuous.” But that is a fantasy. It’s a contest of powers whether that’s measured in votes tallied or bodies on the battlefield.

        I prefer the term “parasite” rather than spiteful mutant because it more accurately describes the nature of this societal pathogen. And parasites flourish in times of great abundance, which is why prolonged affluence always leads to tyranny by parasite. And it always seems to work out that the parasites seize control only after a jackboot corps has become well established as a Praetorian Guard. Can anyone doubt that the Stasi has now become a politically aligned thugacracy? See Trump indictment if you have any doubts.But how can we rid ourselves of these pathogens given the power and presence of the thugacracy (which also extends down to all levels of government)? Well, let’s take a look at Ukraine and see what we can learn. The Western elites engineered a war that got white guys to kill white guys in huge numbers; thereby removing the threat that these normie white guys might one day rise up and rid themselves of the resident parasites. Can that happen here in the West too? You betcha it can, especially if we play along! Soon the West will be faced with defeat or escalation into nuclear war. If defeat occurs, then recession/depression in unavoidable; which leads to chaos and the fog of opportunity. The stupid masses will duke it out at the bottom of the social pyramid (again, as planned by the Cloud People). But what if some of the few remaining smart guys decide to become antibodies instead? Perhaps, Ukraine will show us the way.

        One thing to add is that it is very much in the interests of the leaders of liberal democracies to maintain the liberal myth that “nobody is really in charge,” so that they can claim to be merely executing the democratic will when they act as tyrants, overstepping their constitutional limitations. This, once combined with the Iron Law of Oligarchy (i.e. the recognition that all societies are hierarchical and that there will always be some small cabal exercising real power) results in Bonapartism, the dictatorship of the people’s representatives. It is the end state of every liberal democracy.Moreover, the concept that “nobody is really in charge” becomes, in the hands of these tyrants, and almost perfect pretext for expropriating anybody who might become wealthy enough or strong enough to wield real authority. Liberalism in practice thus becomes the vehicle for endless agitation and permanent revolution.There is no way to completely exterminate what we call liberalism, because the ambition and avarice that drives it is too deeply rooted in human nature. The only thing we can do is contain it by treating it like the sin it is instead of holding it up as a virtue.

What we see underway in the United States either stems from fear of that coming to an end or confidence that more power can be attained. We cannot peer into that box to ascertain which it is but it smacks of fear.

        Isn’t it interesting that Marx’s ultimate dream was that a man could “ hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon and raise cattle in the evening and criticize after dinner”It’s the same thing Liberal Democracy seeks to bring to us, an abundance of the material and freedom from the burden of striving for the basics of life.Yet the striving for basic survival is a part of what makes us human.We have built a society unconnected from the basic reality of man’s existence for thousands of years.Maybe the elimination of cattle in Ireland and farmers in the Netherlands, or the stupid Ukraine war, or our unending usury, debt, and spending of our rulers will play a part in getting us back to a society that can function properly again.Or it could be rainbow flags and butt sex for another thousand years who knows?

        This is why liberal democracy will work!!! It will change the people! Get rid of whitey, replace him with negroes, Mexicans and Indians…put the jews in charge of it all… and – magic! Instant Utopia!!!
40 years ago that would have been the basis of a great rude joke…😜

        “The other assumption is that these models must never be opposed. It is why the great champions of communism and liberalism sound more like religious fanatics than reasonable advocates. Once one accepts the moral claims about human freedom, one is compelled to attack anyone who questions these moral claims, as to do otherwise suggests doubt.”That’s it although the moral claims almost always are contra human freedom over time. The models all initially include guard rails–think Bill of Rights–and those come under immediate attack and are dismantled as soon as possible because morality evolves and over time and the old boundaries are seen as impediments to the promised land. This has been known at least since Plato wrote REPUBLIC and described how democracy descends into tyranny. That is a very reliable model he laid out.Needless to write, we have entered the tyranny stage. This gets blamed on populism by some, dictatorial oligarchy by others (which actually happens to be the case with the contemporary West). Whether caused by popular opinion or elite monopoly of power, the end result always is the same. And almost inevitably, the tyrants truly believe they are democratic.Like Africa, tyranny always wins.

            Z: “These are the people who intrude in on your private space and tell you how to live and think. They also seek control of the common space in order to impose increasingly deranged rules on society. These people are overrunning the liberal democracies of the West.What this tells us is that the model does not contain within it the tools to defend itself against these people.”==========It was Massa Lucifer himself who sowed the seeds of Passive Aggression into our DNA.[His bros, Moloch &amp; Gog &amp; Magog &amp; the gang, would have dearly loved to have been responsible for it, but Massa Lucifer seized the opportunity for himself &amp; only himself.]There’s not a dadgum thing you can do about the Passive Aggressive Industrial Complex, other than:A) Ignore it.B) Avoid it.C) Ki11 it [or be ki11ed by it].In no possible legalistic confrontation with the Passive Aggressive Industrial Complex can you ever hope to win.Only Active Aggression can defeat Passive Aggression, and, even then, only very temporarily.Passive Aggression will be with us until the Final Day of Judgement.There’s a reason Dante Alighieri placed the Passive Aggressives – the treacherous &amp; the treasonous – in the very innermost circle of Hell.https://tinyurl.com/276c66km

        Fundamentally, the bare minimum required for a society to live is for a large majority of the population replying affirmative to “would you die for your people?”.  Along most of the west, only a small minority are willing to do so. Western societies are now old, beaten men who are just biding their time until death. The tranny stuff might just be the MAID program at a societal scale.
The final liberation of Western Liberalism is man from life itself.

It doesn’t surprise me that only a small minority would die for their people. What surprises me is that there are any at all are still willing to do so.

        Joke Reagan used to tell: Two fellows in the Soviet Union were walking down the street, and one of them says, “Have we really achieved full Communism? Is this it? Is this now full Communism?” And the other one says, “Oh, hell, no, things are going to get a lot worse.”
You could say that now replacing “full communism” with “full liberal democracy.”

        “The liberal model of society is failing because like all models it leaves out the bits of reality that make the model messy or impossible”.So what constitutes failure in this context? What is success? Sub-Saharan Africa’s population is booming? Is that success? What about India? Or Mexico?Folks here have talked about “the preservation of our people” as a crucial criterion for societal success. Is preservation merely reproduction, or is it something else? Is it the flourishing of our culture? What are the goals for the individual’s flourishing? For the group’s?A key issue on the way to a manifesto for the DR is settling these questions. I think we all agree the liberal west is failing but I’m not sure we all understand or agree on how to define success.

            Some time ago — years, I forget how many — our colleague A B Prosper wrote the following here:. . . The TL:DR version of our platform is “Under the Dissident Right, America is a great place to have a family.” Simple, accurate, to the point and encompasses our entire platform in an elevator pitch. Everything we do flows from this and anyone in our movement whose goals are not wholly aligned to the idea needs to go as well. Once we get off our asses and start communicating that goal and working to it we can make some headway.That’s where I’d start.

        Sweden seems an interesting microcosm (any Swedes weight in).  For years a culturally homogeneous society—clear understanding of norms, obligation…the “rules”.  Got through two world wars intacts—and frankly made a fuck ton of money trading with both sides.  With the spoils of war went down the entitlement path, spent the surplus, but was then able to come to a concensus of how to get back on path.  Then suddenly add in a huge cohort of invaders that neither understood the “rules” or cared to play by them and the whole thing goes to shit in a decade.  Only country I know of that tracks “grenade attacks” as a crime statistic.  One of the drivers of the 1924 Immigration Act, was to stop the importation of failed Marxists fleeing attempted revolutions in Europe.  It worked…for a while.  Most of the “imports” today seem nothing more than blowflies showing up to feast on the carcass.Always remember, as vilified as he was, Pinochet only had to remove about 3,200 Marxists to get Chile back on track.

                True as to the Muslim silver but…you forgot the middlemen that enabled and encouraged that trade, and got rich off it.
(Rich enough to encourage war loans to kings, that spread the war-slave-banking system.  Is that success?)
In other words, a certain type was cultivated.  Was industrial slavery Gaul’s practice under Roman rule?  No, the northern leaders fought, instead.

            While I’m busy dredging up old quotes from this site, here’s another one:In Chile and Argentina, both governments were forced to domesticate well-organised violent left-wing parties which had foreign support. These days the lefty press claims that out of a population of approximately 10m, Pinochet killed 3-4,000 people (.0003-.0004 of the population) and ‘victimised’ 40k (.004). Based on a US population of 300 million, that would be equivalent to 90-120k and 1.2m. During the Argentinian ‘dirty war’ (1976-83, population c. 28m) the lefty press claims 10k-30k were killed, although Argentina’s own post-war commission put it at 13k (.0005). Plus something like 9k (.0003) were imprisoned for long sentences, and another 21k (.0008) for shorter sentences. Based on a US population of 300 million, that would amount to 150k / 90k / 240k. The current US prison population is around 1.4m, with a total under “correctional supervision” (eg prison + parole + etc.) of 6.9m. If we assume that equivalent numbers will need to be dealt with [to get ourselves out of this jam], the figures are large but not unmanageable.

                In a somewhat related analogy, I computed the case that scaled to the present population, about six million men died in the War Between the States.
Relevant to the present and likely future messes: I agree that “the figures are large” but would argue that events will overall be unmanageable. Once civilizational decay has gone down the path(s) our has, I doubt that much short of an honest-to-God system collapse and a mass culling of surplus population will truly reset matters.
