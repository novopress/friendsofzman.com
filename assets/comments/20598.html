                Trivia: Haiti was first (successful?) slave rebellion in Western Hemisphere. Their success as a free nation has been‚Ä¶.uh‚Ä¶.er‚Ä¶.

There arewhiteHaitians! Very few, but check demographics. I guess you get used to living in a compound.

            Meme, precisely.  That‚Äôs why GG&amp;S is a good read‚Äîiff you are educated enough to perceive its inconsistencies and fallacies of logic.  Never had a Normie/Lib use the book in an argument, most don‚Äôt seem to really care to reach such a stage in analysis/support of their beliefs.Anyway, there are myriad of current, modern examples wrt bringing the poor laggards into the 20th century and seeing how they handle modernity and it‚Äôs technology‚Äîparticularly in Africa.  Hell, just bring up South Africa and Rhodesia and have them explain why a completely equipped 1st world nation can be handed over‚Äîintact and functioning‚Äîto these ‚Äújoggers‚Äù and within a generation, they are broken down and bankrupt.

                There is probably a good correlation between ‚Äúeducation‚Äù and gullibility and believing in GG&amp;S.  It‚Äôs a pretty major indictment that most of our most magical thinkers have been ‚Äúeducated‚Äù in our elite institutions.

            Hispaniola is instructive from an HBD standpoint. Haiti and the DR, sharing Hispaniola, have virtually identical climates and natural resources. Haiti is black African and the DR is mestizo. Haiti is the most dreadful nation in the western hemisphere while the DR is reasonably functional and livable.

                I might add as well, the DR is most keen on preventing *any* overflow of Haitians into their territory.  Saw a video awhile back documenting this.  Basically DR immigration authorities ID‚Äôing any and all that look Haitian and grabbing them off the bus or streets and taking them back for deportation.  Of course, the documentary producer was calling this racism.  üòâ

                    Yes, with Spanish Lit got a little historical background on Domincan Republic. I don‚Äôt know the details, but in various periods of time they‚Äôve been plain brutal to Haitians that dared cross the border. Perhaps we could learn something from them?

        I‚Äôm amazed at how people can ignore the obvious, objective reality staring them in the face when it comes to biological diversity. We have thousands of breeds of dogs, all different, that have 99 percent commonality DNA-wise. Why humans are all the same is so illogical on its face. Europe‚Äôs environment selected for the characteristics we see today, as did Africa, Asia and South America.I read this book a few years after it came out and agreed with some of the points in it, but it wasn‚Äôt until I was red pilled that I saw how this book ignored objective reality.As a Southerner, I denied that reality for years. I believed in the empty vessel egalitarian ethos with the best of them. It wasn‚Äôt until I pulled a Sherlock Holmes and eliminated the impossible, leaving whatever was left over as the truth.Why else are most large cities (normie-Cons love to say run by Democrats) cesspools of crime, violence and dysfunction with failing schools and squalor everywhere unless gentrified by white resettlers? Human capital is the most important ingredient for civilization and if you don‚Äôt have it, maintaining modernity when your inhabitants will steal anything not bolted down and will shoot each other over meaningless disputes becomes impossible.As an aside, I‚Äôve become the news translator. I told them at our holiday gathering that if they hear on TV or read in a newspaper the terms ‚Äúyouth,‚Äù ‚Äúteen‚Äù or a ‚Äúrobbery gone wrong,‚Äù that usually feral black youths are involved. I gave my children ‚Äúthe talk‚Äù straight from Derbyshire and one of those rules he gave us is that you flee from any large gathering of ‚Äúteens‚Äù lest there be gunplay.

            I‚Äôve found using the example of dog breeds to be particularly useful in getting through to people. I simply say that the different races are like different dog breeds. All breeds are dogs but the abilities of a Beagle and a Great Dane are obviously not the same. Doesn‚Äôt make one ‚Äúbetter‚Äù in a general sense than the other, but they will be better at different tasks.

                        People universally acknowledge that there are innate intellectual and temperamental differences between various breeds of dogs, but that can be explained away by the process of selective breeding.

There are ‚Äúnatural‚Äù breeds of cats that developed on their own, though further modified by selective breeding.  A Siamese and a Persian have quite different personalities and Siamese are reputed to be the most intelligent of all cats.  I don‚Äôt know why they evolved that way.  They just did.

        A girlfriend gave me GGS to read when it first came out. I flipped through the intro,v saw that he was claiming, simultaneously, that a) people are all the same, and b) the literal Stone Age primitives of Papua New Guinea are the smartest on earth, and burst out laughing. Our relationship ended not long after, for some reason.

As you note, BS. I have years of experience in this area. There are so few Americanized-Africans (~44 million mean iq 85) that have both the interest and the ability to do the work that departments cherry-pick and import from abroad the best out of the MUCH more numerous baseline African populations (&gt;1billion mean iq 71) to fill their diversity billets. Literally, academic affirmative action exists not to help the descendants of slaves but to stroke shitlib egos.

                    Brain drain works at the local level as well.  One of the side effects of the Great Society and the legislated ending of deed restrictions was that Blacks of the ‚Äútalented tenth‚Äù could now move out of segregated areas.  Almost over night the Black neighborhoods were removed of their best and brightest.  And so we have the concentrated ignorance and violence found today in our inner cities.

                I merely challenge the ‚ÄúBlacks too poor to afford college‚Äù folks to name one documented instance of any qualified Black unable to afford college.  As pointed out, any Black student who has any ability to warm a seat for four years in University can easily get a complete ride.And yes, Blacks outside the country are most sought after when the school requires more than a room temperature IQ.  Personal example, son and his best friend went to a private engineering school.  Both were top of the graduating class in different areas.  Parents were invited to special breakfast with Deans and President and other officials for awards and short presentations by recipients.There was one big award‚Äîtop of the graduating class of 20xx.  This went to a Jamaican student‚ÄîBlack, obviously or I‚Äôd not talk about it.I asked son after hearing him speak and saw the family‚Äîlarge, sitting at table‚Äîabout him.  Son replied, yeah these guys are ‚Äúanimals‚Äù (meaning really smart and hard working) and they are all recruited from abroad.  I had no objections, if my son was impressed, then that was good enough for me.  Let the best man win.

                        The school was private, not to my understanding on the public dime.  Therefore, those who can afford it, purchase dtheir place there.  As long as merit remains the criteria for those who attend, I‚Äôm content.One other thing along those lines, the school had a large number of Russian faculty (former USSR types).  These guys were tops in their fields and fled as soon as they could get out of that shitshow called communism.Perhaps they took a US graduate‚Äôs job, I don‚Äôt know.  But I do know they impressed my son as none other.  These guys literally berated the students as fat, dumb and lazy‚Äîwhich they were by and large.  They brooked no BS from students in class. They repeatedly impressed upon them the horrors of the country they left and the good fortune the students in class had being here in US.  The students rose to the occasion.My impression was these old guys in suit and tie passed on a tradition of education long lost in our modern Universities and while doing so left a better person than they found in class.  Money well spent.

It‚Äôs not about merit. It‚Äôs about tribe/family. Let them train their own. Should we let into the country anyone who is a great guy or smart? Would Israel let in 20 million super high-IQ Chinese because they‚Äôre smart and hard-working?

Of course not, because they aren‚Äôt family. Simple.

What about tribe/family do you not get?

The ironic part is that‚Äôs mechanically easier to accomplish than you‚Äôd imagine. Have a bachelors degree is basically a general requisite for any foreigner seeking employment, having an advanced STEM degree you can walk into many jobs here. Thing is, you have to fit in somehow. Not be Japanese, but I mean fulfill some expected role. Practically play out an archetype. In other words, you conform to the Japanese, not the other way around.

                                    It‚Äôs not about conforming. Regression to the mean says that the fairly white-acting black guy‚Äôs kids and certainly grandkids and most definitely great grandkids will act like your average black.

If Japan let in enough Japanese, it‚Äôs the Japanese who would have to conform.

Not sure why it‚Äôs hard for people to understand regression to mean. Obviously, it‚Äôs not, but generations of conditioning have made us retarded.

            You‚Äôre very lucky, Citizen.

You are absolutely right in all of that. It‚Äôs always the woman, it‚Äôs always the same hypocrisy, and when you bust them on it, as you did ‚Äì the response is usually NOT crickets ‚Äì it‚Äôs shocked disbelief, then rage, then accusations of racism, fascism, crimethink, etc etc.

                You‚Äôre right. It was crickets this time, but usually, I‚Äôm met with anger and accusations when I point out their logical inconsistencies and hypocrisy.And their husbands ‚Äì who I know or, at least, suspect ‚Äì agree with me never say a word. The women are the most hostile, but that‚Äôs just nature‚Äôs way. Women need the tribe for protection so they will defend its dogma most intensely. We live in a theocracy ‚Äì the Cult of Equality ‚Äì so women will accept and defend its beliefs the most. It‚Äôs in their DNA.Women follow whomever they believe is in charge. That‚Äôs not an insult. It‚Äôs nature. We trash on white women a lot around here, but the truth is that white men don‚Äôt offer them another community/tribe that will protect them.

But even she seems happiest when I say, This is my path; I‚Äôm going this direction with or without you. Women want a strong man. Not a dick or some guy who hits them. Just a man who knows his path.

            Epaminondas, I hear you.  But I can also testify wrt a friend from church who went on a ‚Äúmission‚Äù of sorts for the church to help the poor Christians down South build homes for themselves.  He went once and came back red-pilled.  Took him one mission and what he described to me wrt the people he was helping could make quite a blog posting for this group.  So it‚Äôs a two edged sword I believe.

        I don‚Äôt have the link at my fingertips, but there is an online interview in which Jared Diamond admits that he undertook the writing ofGuns, Germs, and Steel&gt;for the explicit purpose of demonstrating how superior European achievement can be explained without involving racial differences.In other words, he had already arrived at his conclusion before he began his ‚Äòresearch‚Äô!In the same interview, he presents his thesis‚Äî without offering any supporting evidence‚Äî that the natives of Paupau New Guinea are actuallymore intelligent and resourcefulthan Europeans!A clear case of someone already wedded to a certain (‚Äòegalitarian‚Äô, politically-correct) conclusion, and searching for ‚Äòevidence‚Äô which will confirm it.

                Thanks! You beat me to it. A fun fact about this. ‚ÄúDiamond‚Äù is a very j00 last name. In fact, there is a reason for this that I read an article about not long ago. I was trying to figure out why so many specials are named after gemstones and precious metals. Diamond, Silver, Silverstein, Goldberg, Satin, etc.Turns out this ‚Äòmaster race‚Äô being a semitic tribe of wandering nomads couldn‚Äôt be bothered with last names for a long long time. To get them into the modern world they were ‚Äòassigned‚Äô them by the Germans and various other more civilized European societies. They largely riffed off their profession which was usury (hence gold/silver/etc),jewelry (its IN the name, lol!), and the few that had an honest trade.The rest were basically lumped by geographic region or something more generic. Hence the ‚Äòberg/burg/stein‚Äô thing. So the uber IQ chosen race did not even have the foresight to assign a name other than the first, it had to be done for them by Europeans and Russians basically.

            ‚Äúthe natives of Paupau New Guinea are actuallymore intelligent and resourcefulthan Europeans!‚ÄùNow THAT is an impressive level of cognitive dissonance and bias. The pathological altruism of normies today can really be astounding sometimes!I remember years ago my Mom was relating an NPR story she heard. Apparently some anthropologist went off to study a primitive tribe known for beheading its people as a form of punishment. After they would decapitate someone, the tribe would all partake in some ritualistic form of groaning, similar to keening. The guy‚Äôs mission was to figure out the purpose or ‚Äúmeaning‚Äù of the keening.Apparently a member of his own team was beheaded, and yet the guy decided to continue to finish his research. At this point in my Mom‚Äôs retelling, I‚Äôm really trying to hold back laughter.Then she tells me the guy‚Äôs conclusion. Apparently he said this primitive ‚Äúkeening‚Äù was the expression of emotion we modern Westerners lacked. They are just further along on the emotional spectrum‚Ä¶ My Mom was relating this in all sincerity, as if this was some profound discovery. But I couldn‚Äôt help it. At that point I burst out laughing. Uncontrollably.

                Doesn‚Äôt E. Michael Jones have a similar ridiculous position. Something like Europe would be like Africa if it wasn‚Äôt for the Catholic church, or maybe it was Africa would be like Europe if it had .
I like many of his takes and read a few of his books but for the love of God! There really are some ideas so preposterous that only intellectuals can believe them. As a practicing Catholic this hurts to see in someone like him.
By the way, the Church was very instrumental in much good in western civilization but still, come on.

                    Well I mean my own Celtic and Germanic ancestors were like Africa before Christianity. The same interminable tribal conflicts, horrifying ritual practices (including human sacrifice and bestiality(!)), and other horrors. Like how Vikings thought what was best in life was to sail over to some bastard who you don‚Äôt know from Adam, kill him, rape his wife, and take his stuff. If my community bordered ancient pre-Christian Ireland or Friesland we would have built the wall and staffed it with machine gunners years ago.Meanwhile, for its many problems Ethiopia was definitely head and shoulders above its neighbors by miles and miles. Christianity seems to make a difference.

                        Sorry, I don‚Äôt buy it. Our society and culture is not only Greco-Romano-Christian, but also very much Germanic in terms of our customs and law. (And I‚Äôm completely ignoring that bullshit ‚ÄúAthens and Jerusalem‚Äù nonsense which is the culturo-historical equivalent of fanfiction to insert The Best People into everything after the fact.I would not dismiss Celts and Germans as painted, animal-humping savages who were only finally civilized by a Europeanized version of a middle-eastern cult. Certainly Christianity had a huge effect on Europe, but bear in mind that the Roman Catholic Church was in turn itself influenced by local beliefs. Inconvenient gods and powers that could not be destroyed were instead co-opted into becoming Saints.Finally, ‚Äúviking‚Äù was a part-time job description. Sure there were people who made their full-time existence, but for others ‚Äúgoing viking‚Äù was a thing you did when the crops didn‚Äôt come in and you had to go raiding to survive.

                            A bit off topic, but some of the ancient monuments still defy reasonable explainations as to their construction. For the Celts (or earlier?) Stonehenge for instance. Some of the rocks were moved long distances (&gt;100 miles) and it‚Äôs not clear how primitives with no tools could do so. These may not compare with other head-scratchers (Macchu Pichu, Great Pyramids), but ancient man did some really amazing feats. Even harder than explaining how, is to explain why they went to such elaborate efforts. Forgive me, one too many Von Daniken books in my youth! üòÄ

                    In general, Roman Catholics are more willing to give credit where credit is due to our polytheist forebears than evangelicals are
There are some Christians who want to give the credit for Western success to Christianity.  Rodney Stark also comes to mind.  The fact is that Europeans did some pretty amazing things before Europe was Christianized and many Christian peoples are a mediocre lot, such as Kenyans and Guatemalans.
Of course, it would be ‚Äúracist‚Äù to give credit to White people.

                Reminds me of the book, Don‚Äôt Sleep, There are Snakes.  A Christian missionary goes into the jungle and comes out an enlightened atheist.  He too really went overboard on how awesome this failed tribe is.  They are so dumb that when boats were made for them, they used them until they didn‚Äôt work anymore and then went back to their old way, even though they were taught how to make them.They were so incapable of abstract thinking that they could not obtain any lesson from the Bible other than the literal words of the parable.  He tells the story of how they would laugh out loud at the suffering of characters of the Bible. He made a big deal about their total inability to think about either the past or the future. This complete inability to think about abstract concepts is the very thing that convinces him that they are smarter than us and that Christianity is wrong.The book is worth a read and there are a number of speeches has given up on YouTube.

                    There‚Äôs a fellow I work with, uber-Christian, who married a girl who was raised by missionary parents in the Congo.  He‚Äôs no dissident (in fact, his wife is miraculously more normal than he is) but he‚Äôs told me about the fact that his in-laws lament the fact that members of their own congregation will continue to steal things right out in the open, despite repeated Christian admonitions to the contrary.  They‚Äôve been living there a couple decades, witnessing this shit the entire time, and yet they still persist in trying to make a silk purse from a sow‚Äôs ear.  The stupidity boggles the mind.

In two ways, Islam is good for Blacks because it micromanages a believer‚Äôs life right down to the proper way to relieve oneself and demands draconian punishments for misbehavior.  That they understand.

Alternative explanation for the ‚Äòkeening over the beheaded they just killed in New Guinea‚Äô: Knowing at some level that they now will have to contend with his vengeful spirit.  Hoping to placate that spirit with a fake show of remorse, IIRC from colonial ethnography.

        I made the mistake of taking an Introduction to Sociology course at an Ivy League university about ten years ago.

Literally every single thing we read in the class boiled down to:making excuses for black people.

Diamond is squarely in that tradition.There is just an absolutelyenormousindustry devoted solely to this practice. And ‚Äúrespectable‚Äù academics will publish absolutely absurd theories in order to stand out in this crowded field.

The strange thing is that they‚Äôve built mountains of lies in order to hide two humble little letters:

        Steve Sailer has written a lot about Diamond over the years.  Here‚Äôs an interesting meeting Steve had with Diamond from a 2005 article in Vdare:As far as I can tell, Diamond only lectures, never debates. I‚Äôve never heard of him ever allowing himself to be dragged into a public discussion with a well-informed opponent.I talked to Diamond once after he gave a speech. We were chatting nicely until I asked him a tough question along the lines outlined above: Wouldn‚Äôt differentagricultural environmentsselect for different hereditary traits in different locales?I mentioned how James Q. Wilson‚ÄôsThe Marriage Problemhas a couple of chapters on how tropical agriculture inWest Africa affects family structures.Since women can raise enough food to feed their kids, men don‚Äôt invest as much in their individual children. So wouldn‚Äôt the kind of man with the most surviving children be different in a tropical agricultural environment, where he doesn‚Äôt need to work too much to support them, than in a temperate agricultural environment, where he does?Now, Diamond has spent a lot of time birdwatching in New Guinea, which is similar to Africa. So he knows all about what tropical agriculture selects for. But he had¬†no¬†intention of touching¬†that¬†tar-baby with a ten-foot pole. To get away from me and my question, he grabbed his papers and literally dog-trotted at about 5 mph out of the auditorium!https://vdare.com/articles/jared-diamond-the-new-king-of-all-media

I understand Jewish motivations and tactics. They‚Äôre running a disinformation campaign. Doesn‚Äôt do any good to acknowledge that fact.
OTOH, gentile whites peddling the same stuff are far more fascinating. Their motivations and end goals vary greatly.

                Sounds like my experience with a prominent Presbyterian who spent a lot of time in Africa paying for wells to provide clean water.

            I was so confused as to why whites would work so hard and come up with such elaborate falsehoods to undermine their own kin before I put that one together. Once I did it was very cathartic. It all made sense now. It wasn‚Äôt our group trying to undermine our own kind for some suicidal reason, it was an alien group undermining our power in order to maintain their own supremacy. It actually made me happy in a way. I was very blackpilled on whites before I started asking the JQ. Now I love my people and want to do everything I can to save them.

            An oft quoted phrase (below) but it really cuts to the hear of the matter. You can explain the entire modern era and dysfunction with that simple word you posted above: jealousy. Or some form of it, hatred, fear, etc.They are all bundled together by people that realize that the 300,000 year head start genetically (if you follow HBD science) is a bar that can only be lowered by either capturing white genes through admixture (jews masterfully did this all through the 19th and 20th century, thanks to the naivete of Eastern europeans and Russians primarily. Or the alternative, eradication which we are currently experiencing by the World War Z like flood of never ending mud people into all Western nations.Relevant Quote:Western man towers over the rest of the world in ways so large as to be almost inexpressible. It‚Äôs Western exploration, science, and conquest that have revealed the world to itself. Other races feel like subjects of Western power long after colonialism, imperialism, and slavery have disappeared. The charge of racism puzzles whites who feel not hostility, but only baffled good will, because they don‚Äôt grasp what it really means: humiliation. The white man presents an image of superiority even when he isn‚Äôt conscious of it. And, superiority excites envy. Destroying white civilization is the inmost desire of the league of designated victims we call minorities. -SobranÔªøNo amount of uplift is going to erase 300K years of genetic fitness. These people cannot understand decades, you think they will comprehend epochs?

                    Separation assumes all of this perceived jealousy is on the part of minorities.  I believe the behavior is supported by a lot of research in White groups as well.  It‚Äôs really the basis of lots of public policy decisions when you get down to it.  Folks will often chose to be equally poor rather than unequally rich if given the choice/power.

So getting separated from minorities is only half the battle.  In some instances, I can see needing to separate from ‚ÄúGood Whites‚Äù as well.

                I‚Äôve been told by liberals how ‚Äúlucky‚Äù I am to have been born in the west. I look at them and laugh as I say that luck had nothing to do with it.
I am the culmination of millennia of my ancestors diligence and sacrifice, I could not have been born to any other people or place. When I further express my pride in my forefathers, the liberal mood further worsens as I reject their projection of shame and guilt.

        Politics is downstream of culture and culture is downstream of biology. The differences between us are not only not skin deep, but begin with significant observed genomic variation in the neural, endocrine, and immune systems. Different peoples have different preferences for how to socially, economically, and politically organize themselves and these preferences are rooted in biology.There is no ‚Äòone-size-fits-all‚Äô way for humanity to live together in peace. Diversity has never been a strength anywhere at any time in human history. The way forward is omni-nationalism (many nationalisms) where each large group has their own space and is in complete control of local organizational choices, but the nations work together to build respect for borders and sovereignty.

        Big nose has much to answer for in this past century.  The purblind stupidity of the virtue signaling egalitarian believing ‚Äúgood whites‚Äù is breathtaking to behold.

        I didn‚Äôt read Guns, Germs and Steel in depth, but I remember glancing through it in a book store.Oddly it reminded me of a book about the Kennedy assassination by David Lifton, ‚ÄúBest Evidence‚Äù. What they had in common was that the author had spun a perfectly plausible, detailed and perfectly internally consistent alternate explanation for a historical occurrence. The problem in both cases wasn‚Äôt that the theory was implausible, the problem was that, plausible or not, the author presented not a whit of evidence that the plausible occurrence had actually occurred.Basically, the tactic is that the author advances a plausible sounding theory, and then tells you, ‚ÄúWell, this might have happened, or that might have happened, but since we really can‚Äôt prove anything, you‚Äôre obliged to accept my theory.‚Äù It mostly reminds me of creationists trying to undermine evolution. They have no evidence for their arguments, they‚Äôre just using hypotheticals to take pot shots at their opponents arguments.

            An excellent point. I‚Äôve been reading about, and writing an essay about, the hypothesis the Wuhan lab as origin for the COVID-19 pandemic. As I resarched, it sounds very much like ‚ÄúBest Evidence.‚Äù In the case of the virus, there is no doubt who was working on what, they were doing it openly, nearly 20 years, published academic research often with USA funding. Among other appalling goals, make hotrodded germs for research, that would be dangerous plagues if they ever got loose. Relevant to COVID-19, just reading a few papers will show you that they essentially had a prototype SARS-CoV-2 virus even five years ago. But to be able to prove, beyond all doubt, that it was indeed an escaped ‚Äúartificial‚Äù virus that started the epidemic, that may well be impossible. I do believe that most of the evidence points to that, but prove it? How?

                yes this is the kind of cocktail party gatekeeping that keeps goodwhites from ever evolving into badwhites. Should anyone wander off the progressive reservation, great points from this book get mentioned and with a couple of swirls of cabernet the conversation is back inside the wire. Whats most dangerous about this is that not only are people kept in slumber but the believe they are smarter for having probed the frontier only to be reassured that their progressive orthodoxy is true and right. And they are self-assured in their place among the intellectual NYT strivers so they can spread it down the line.

                Given that environment is ostensibly almighty, it‚Äôs passing strange that whites who settled in southern Africa in the 17th century didn‚Äôt regress to the level of the Hutu.

                    The pre-Coumbian residents of North America were the great agronomists of perhaps any time. You probably don‚Äôt go a day without consuming a food stuff that originated in the western hemisphere and was unknown elsewhere until the 16th century, tomatoes, potatoes, pumpkins, peanuts, chocolate, vanilla, blueberries and corn, among other foods. They didn‚Äôt invent gunpowder or develop the metals necessary to produce genocide on an industrial basis so they do, in that sense, lack cultural achievement.

            ‚ÄúAt this point‚Äù -You shouldn‚Äôt be. Guns, Germs and Steel was written decades ago, and it‚Äôs books like this which have brainwashed the smarter half of the midwits into denying reality in favor of a blind adherence to the status quo. This piece of mind control provides a way to quiet the discomfort caused by the cognitive dissonance suffered by those who know anything about history. Like others have said, this provides an intellectual escape hatch with which they are tricked into denying their own independent conclusions about reality in favor of a kosher explanation of the obvious inconsistencies in the liberal religion. ‚ÄúIf everyone is equal why does everything that has ever happened in history seem to disconfirm this notion?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, because of all these pseudoscientific explainatiions‚Ä¶ Oh good, I don‚Äôt have to realize that our entirely society since 1965 has been built on a lie‚Ä¶ Thank god, that would have been very uncomfortable for me, I was very scared because I was starting to engage in badthink.‚Äù

            As I mentioned in a different post, this is largely true for cosmopolitans.  For them, place of birth really is luck of the draw and a gift from the universe.  But for everyone else, they inherit the culture from the previous generations just as surely as they inherit their looks or intelligence or lack thereof.

It reinforces their hope that they really are the true chosen, destined to be above the rest.

                    I have something slightly different.  I don‚Äôt necessarily think my tribe is the best and has been selected by God to be his special tribe.  What I think is that I like my tribe and am only comfortable living within my tribe and that my tribe is the best at setting up a society that people like me like.From my experience, that is how a lot of people think of their tribe. If you ever talk to foreigners who have just recently visited ‚Äúhome,‚Äù they talk wistfully about the visit and all the things they like about home and how here doesn‚Äôt measure up.

            Have some fun with him. Ask him whether he‚Äôs thinking of moving his family to a mix neighborhood and/or sending his kids to a mixed school so they don‚Äôt have so much privilege.Seriously, though, a great tactic with people like this is to be 100% on their side. Agree 100% that white privilege is real and horrible. Then, just follow the logic to its natural conclusion: Whites should be stripped of their wealth and forced to live with other groups so our ill-gotten culture/privilege can rub off on them.Your brother-in-law doesn‚Äôt really believe what he‚Äôs saying. If he did, you‚Äôd see it in how he lives his life day in and day out, but you don‚Äôt. He‚Äôs getting to preen and bask in the glory of his goodness without having to give anything up. Point that out.Btw, don‚Äôt expect him to be happy about your pointing out his hypocrisy, not will other people back you up since they‚Äôre all hypocrites as well. But it can be fun. Actually, the best way to do this is in extremely small doses, just enough to tweak him but not to confront him. Slowly undermine him.

                I like that tactic, Citizen. Another one that‚Äôs fun to do is also agree 100 percent that white privilege is a problem. But first we should work on a couple of larger problems: Asian Privilege and Jewish Privilege. After all, those two groups make more money per capita than whites, do well in school, etc. Then watch your leftist friend shut up real fast about white privilege.

                I get your point.  But the only way to strip a White of his wealth would be to take it, and then prevent him from further accumulation of wealth.  In short, make him a slave or a prisoner.  For if left to compete in a fair economic process, he will again acquire such wealth from his inferiors.

                I live inside the Beltway near Chevy Chase. Full of virtue-signaling leftists. Every third house ‚ÄúHate Has No Home Here‚Äù, that sort of thing. But now the neighborhood is full of signs for two white guys running for school board after the Diversity board members started advocating school busing with the explicit justification of changing demographic mix in schools. Hilarious, or would be if the stakes weren‚Äôt so high. Deep down, my neighbors must acknowledge reality, but I‚Äôm convinced that virtue-signaling feeling is intoxicating, as long as there‚Äôs no risk. Conclusion: some SWPLs can be brought to this side of the great divide, but only after they‚Äôre made to feel the consequence of their politics.

It was then that I understood that there was no reasoning with these people.

                    I grew up just south in slighly less aflluent Vienna (the cheaper neighborhoods). They are true liberals, they do love the Others, they are just worried for the astronomical value of their homes. With all the trouble PG had in 1960s?-1970s with bussing, I am surprised anybody in Montgomery would even want to consider it.

                Perhaps it‚Äôs not that wrong?  No, we should not readily accept that folks should die when being restrained, but I‚Äôve seen police put a knee on a down man‚Äôs head or neck more than once in videos.  Usually, the suspect is cuffed quickly and it‚Äôs over when there are two or more cops.  Here there were four and one looked like he was more interested in moving the public back than subduing the suspect.  He didn‚Äôt even turn around to watch.So is this a subduing tactic gone wrong, or brutality with an logical expectation of physical harm?  We need more examination and information.  Unfortunately, we seem to be administering hasty justice in the (false) hope of maintaining societal calm.  And as I just heard it, they are already rioting.  So it‚Äôs a lose/lose situation.  The mob is not placated and police morale is lowered.I‚Äôm sure in the not too distant (dystopian) future, we‚Äôll have police protocols where they are required to ask a suspect‚Äôs permission to arrest him for a crime.  Sort of like asking your date in college for a kiss at a party.

                Be careful there, as some questions are not allowed.
I remember the Rodney King issue many years back. My father had recently retired from the LAPD and had some inside info. Basically, RK got the beating he deserved, but the cops who did it were too stupid to do it in private.
A few years after some liberal asked him about it. He turned it back on her by pointing out that RK had, once again, been arrested for domestic violence.

            Meanwhile the hysteria over the original Jogger reaches new levels of outlandishness I never thought would have been possible. Not only has the guy filming the whole accident been arrested and charged with felony murder, but according to the latest Radio Derb, law enforcement is hunting for the McMichaels‚Äô childhood schoolteachers and have even hauled in their dentists and Starbucks baristas for questioning.I honestly can‚Äôt tell if the Derb was joking or if those things actually happened.And still no wall-to-wall coverage from the MSM on the slaughter of the Marinos.Regarding this latest accident‚Ä¶ who cares. I‚Äôm under no illusions that the police will ever be on our side, but as someone commented a few posts back, my first impression is to stand with the white guys no matter what. If it turns out they messed up, the correct response is still to defend them unflinchingly to the outside world, and punish them quietly and discreetly internally if necessary. That‚Äôs what every other ethnic group with ingroup preference does: they defend ‚Äî or ignore or whitewash ‚Äî their criminals to outgroups, and then later punish them within the ingroup if necessary. Judging by many AmNat responses to the latest Jogger-instigated accident on social media, even our own guys have a long way to go to relearning ingroup preference.Yeah I know the police are not on our side. Just look at the double standards they used during the Viral Lockdowns where they let Joggers run free at the same time as they harassed white park-goers, pedestrians, and business owners.But the point is, we can understand that the police are an adversarialinstitutionseparately from any white guys who happen to be police. Who knows, maybe the Minneapolis guys are good guys who made a mistake because they‚Äôve been fatigued by the usual Jogger criminality. People make mistakes when they‚Äôre fatigued. My first impulse is to stand with them no matter what: we can quietly punish them later within the ingroup if it turns out there was any kind of malice. And even if there was, honestly‚Ä¶ who cares? I only care if malice is exerted against my tribe, I don‚Äôt care about other tribes.

The way to deal with that, since it rubs the wrong way, is to punish anything that brings shame or harm to one‚Äôs Skin.

Self-policing. Notice that our betters have lost control of it, and it‚Äôs eating them alive.  More proof then that theirs is the social construct, based on imposed projection.

                    From some reading on tribes (Fukuyama maybe?) I remember being surprised to learn that, as noted above, even in the case of an offense against another tribe, the perp‚Äôs own tribe should be the one to adminster the punishment, even if it was execution. At first killing one‚Äôs own, even for a crime, seems unnatural but it had a practical survival purpose: to keep peace with the out-tribe. Equally logical would be to argue the victim‚Äôs tribe should have the right to punish, but the likely result from that is blood feud or tribal wars.

Well now, that would depend on what sort of achievement you deem worthy/fit for your trophy case. Do you value creation of or power over something? Some might say that the modern Occident near-entirely is IN the Jewish trophy case.

        Some of the thinking on this thread confuses me so if I sound confused, I am just trying to fit in. üôÇI was big into HBD research before anyone knew what that was. Before it had that name. People are different and heredity plays a huge part in what you will be. Yes, life experiences also play a part, but not as big a one as most people think.Yes, I believe in the 5 laws of HBD.Ok then. How did we get so different? If we talk breeds of dogs to describe differences in tribes of humans (or races), then how did that happen?I believe God used evolution. Some believe in just plain evolution. Regardless, a man is lucky to be born in the southern Appalachian mountains rather than in a tribe of Africans. But is that anyone‚Äôs fault? We are all what we are born to be and it is luck in a way. I am not suited to live in southern Africa as a primitive hunter gatherer. And most Africans are not suited to running a modern technological society. So? That is not my fault; go blame God.Because we all come into this world with different gifts and talents (Christians believe this) we should never expect equal outcomes. I can not write as well as Z, but I bet I can do something better than he. The modern notion of egalitarianism is a revolt against nature. A revolt against reality. A revolt against God.Why does no one care that blacks have an advantage in the game of basketball? Especially over Asians. Why is there not one Asian superstar quarterback in the NFL? Why do we care? Why do we have to make it political?You know why. Quotas, set-asides, affirmative action, give-mes for all the pet victims of the left.Until whites realize we are not responsible for blacks having a lower IQ, on average, than whites we can not understand reality.So, my message is help your fellow whites wake the hell up.

            God use evolution.  Of course he does.  Can‚Äôt get some fundamentalists to believe this however.  If you‚Äôre an atheist, go to the next comment.Ever since I was young and became aware of the controversy between some fundamentalists and the scientists promoting evolution, I almost immediately failed to see the conflict.  If one is a believer, God created the universe and set it in motion (gave the laws by which it reacts).We see all around us in everything and every way that nothing is static, but change is a constant.  Any creation such as man‚Äîand all life on earth for that matter‚Äîwould need to change as the earth changed or perish.  Why would evolution therefore not be seen as part of God‚Äôs plan?

        A book like Guns, Germs and Steel could only originate from a Jewish mind.  Because unlike Jews, Europeans did not have the good luck to be born into a society their ancestors did not create.  For Jews it really is just the luck of birth. Had their ancestors chose some other destination, like the Middle East, they would have been born into very different circumstances.But this is not true of the European.  The European is born into his homeland that HIS ancestors created. For him, it could not have happened any other way. Had he been born in some other place, he wouldn‚Äôt be him. He would posses different DNA and have a different experience.  He lives the life he does because his people have set up a culture and society that only his people could have created. He has inherited the wealth of his people just as the Syrian or Ethiopian has inherited the wealth of his people. The fact that the wealth of each people is not equal is just part of life.This is the mistake all cosmopolitans make. They see the world they grew up in as the luck of the draw of where you happen to have been born. He understands that he would have a very different lot had he been so unfortunate to having been born in some other place. For him, it is possible because his ancestors moved into other cultures.But culture is not a gift from the universe that you inherit through happenstance and luck for most people. You inherit the talents and accomplishments of your own people via the culture just as you inherit your looks and your intelligence, biologically.

        I had to read GGS way back in the mid 90s as an undergrad. I find it quaint now that we know that Europeans (and to a lesser extent some Asians) have Neanderthal genes. Guess who doesn‚Äôt? Negroes.

            I still watch various science videos on YouTube.  Every now and then there‚Äôs one about human evolution.  At some point they will mention that modern Europeans basically came about through hybridizing with Neanderthals and Asians from both that and a less well known group called the Denisovans.  Then they will mention the fact that Africans seem to have no infusions of genes from either group.  You can almost hear the ‚Äúmoving right along‚Äù after they bring that up.  It‚Äôs tempting to wonder if there might be something in this that, well, explains certain things‚Ä¶ We must resist those temptations though brothers, now join with me in reciting the ‚ÄúI have a dream‚Äù speech.Those videos (things like Sci-show and Vsauce for example) are also a good window into the ‚ÄúI fookin luv science‚Äù wing of the hipster goodwhite mentality.  The male announcers tend to be thin, a bit snarky, and wear a lot of plaid.  The goal seems to be for them to be as non-threatening as possible.  The women are stereotypical SJW flakes with rainbow hair, pierced eyebrows and that smug demeanor you see in girls who went to a good college to study something utterly useless.  The way they drive right up to the edge of HBD-awareness only to veer off at the last moment illustrated the way modern goodwhites like to wear ‚Äúscience‚Äù as a fashion statement and sign of their social class while totally missing the point about following its leads even into ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù territory.  It‚Äôs like watching a bunch of tourists who‚Äôve just taken a helicopter to the summit of Everest posing for pictures with ice axes and climbing gear.

                It really starts sinking in with the new science  that Neanderthals were not stupid, hairy brutes, and likely were just as intelligent as Homo sapiens.  They‚Äôll endlessly bang on about Neanderthal genes for red hair or straight hair but seem curiously uninterested in Neanderthal genes in our brains, and what that implies for Negro cognition.

We‚Äôre really a different species, but that‚Äôs unspeakable Badthink.

            I used to hold a similar view when I was a Good White. But exposure to other ethnic groups quickly banished such silly views.

Ethnic loyalties DO MATTER  Just because you have SJW leanings doesn;‚Äôt mean squat to brown skinned ethnics or to Jews. All they see is a white SUCKER.

        Lot going on here.Back in the day, I was thinking about joining the State Department because reasons. In preparation, there was a reading list and on that list was both of the books Z mentions in this post. I couldn‚Äôt be bothered withGuns, but I readWhy NationsFailand thought it to be complete crap. That helped soften the blow when they found my narrative of how I benefited from my many multicultural experiences to be not very compelling.But, yeah, it‚Äôs important to understand that this sort of thing is exactly what the people running American foreign policy think is a great read if you want to be like them.Still, there is something to the insight that we did not somehow ‚Äúearn‚Äù our state. Most of the things about us did not come through some particular virtue ‚Äì except insofar as survival can be thought of as a virtue ‚Äì but were something like gifts. Bach did not give himself musical genius, though he cooperated with that gift. The farmers in medieval France did not give themselves the intelligence to make a better plow, but they cooperated with the intelligence that was their inheritance.But then, as someone once said, to him who has, more will be given.

That inheritance was PAID in full, in advance, with the suffering and death of their forebears. (before the industrial revolution boreal winters were a bitch) We have higher mean cognitive and cooperative capabilities than Africans because the excessively stupid and uncooperative were weeded out of our gene pool. East Asians went through a similar process and Africans did not.

It is not our responsibility to fix this problem which is not of our making, but to isolate ourselves from the consequences.

                Yeah, but it wasn‚Äôt paid by us. From our perspective, it was a gift. My great-grandfather tamed a homestead in North Dakota, I only inherited some of his grit. He earned it.
I think my point is that what we have is, in some important way, not really ours to do with as we see fit. We don‚Äôt really have the right to settle Somalians in Minnesota and it‚Äôs only a lack of respect that makes anyone consider it.

        I attempted to read Guns, Germs and Steel a number of years ago. If I recollect correctly, I got through two chapters and decided reading any further would be a waste of time. It was clear by that point that it was an exercise in making sweeping ‚Äúscientific‚Äù conclusions based on cherry picked anecdotal evidence.  For the same reason I have never been able to come close to finishing anything by Malcolm Gladwell.  These folks claim to be presenting ‚Äúscience‚Äù in a form accessible to the Average Joe, when in fact they are taking a desired conclusion, usually one that will flatter the reader, and work back from it using examples that have multiple, and usually better, explanations than the author‚Äôs pet theory.It‚Äôs sad that such ‚Äúscience‚Äù is popular, it is sadder that many people actually believe it has any value.

        I was bought this book for Christmas by my brother in law, so read it in full. I was not aware of the JQ at the time so assumed JD was ‚Äòwhitey‚Äô and sincere in his arguments. But I was working in South Sudan back then and fully understood how Africa really works, so I was better informed than most. I felt that the title was completely wrong, and simply needed to be called ‚Äòagriculture‚Äô.His argument was very weak and full of fallacies and I didn‚Äôt like the book much. Also he put a load of random photos of the faces of various tribes into the book for no real reason. But, as mentioned here, there is a section where he states that Europeans are not superior in any way despite all the achievements by Europeans over the past 500 years. On the next page (yes, and I did check) he then stated how a particular tribe (can‚Äôt remember the exact reason but I think it was to do with their internal mapping of their tribal area) was more superior (genetically) to the European. When reading this I had to do a double-check to confirm these two arguments 2 pages apart. From that point on I couldn‚Äôt take the book at all seriously and wondered a. why did he publish, and b. why do so many good-whites rave on about it.Whilst I‚Äôve not read it in a while ‚ÄòThe Wealth and Poverty of Nations‚Äô by David Landes is way better. It‚Äôs certainly not our thing or a red pill but a good -white can read it and at least accept that some civilisations work better than others. He gives Africa a free pass (which he shouldn‚Äôt have) but maybe he had to do that to get past the publishers.

            I brought David Landes book when it came out. I was a subschriber to ‚ÄúThe Economist‚Äù back then and they had given his book a poor review. They didn‚Äôt like that he wrote that culture made such a difference. So, it was a tabu back then too.

            ‚Äúcan‚Äôt remember the exact reason but I think it was to do with their internal mapping of their tribal area‚ÄùThis sounds like arguments made in favor of the supposed intellectual superiority of Australian aboriginals on the basis of the their mythology regarding ‚ÄúSonglines‚Äù laid down by semi-mythical ancestors and completely mythical spirits.To be clear, I actually have no problem with people having a mythical (and/or mystical) belief connecting them to the land and their ancestors. That might even be a good thing. Where I have a problem is twofold: 1) how much do I have to bend my own life and beliefs to respect your myths; 2) if you demand that others bend to your beliefs, then you need to stay on your own patch.

        Because this book is both dangerous and so poorly argued it is useful in picking apart all the foundations of Blank Slatism. This is especially true in circles of people who think of themselves as educated, well-read, contemplative, etc‚Ä¶Faulk‚Äôs video is very good. There are also a lot of very critical reviews from academics of the book. It‚Äôs now more accepted in anthropology depts than it was when it came out. This tells you something about the ever declining state of the academy. Anthropology depts were largely already progressive and anti-white in the late 90s but there were limits to the depths they were willing to sink to.We should read the books our enemies see as creedal. If we understand where their objections to group differences come from they become easier to pick apart.Almost all progressive argument that are anti-white boil down to‚Ä¶not innate differences in races but to the greater agency of whites who are less attentive to nature‚Ä¶and who then put that greater agency to nefarious purposes which preys upon the good will and gentle nature of all other peoples.Books like this one get the royal treatment because academia, book makers, book chatters and a whole host of other interdependent networks are run by the gem collectors.

Precisely.  That‚Äôs why I called GG&amp;S a good read.  It is a pretty good compendium of oft used argument(s) against HBD.  One needs to be familiar with it, rather than just condemning it off hand.
The follow up book, ‚ÄúCollapse‚Äù, is not as good a read, but does illustrate the author‚Äôs biases wrt ecology as does GG&amp;S wrt HBD.

        There‚Äôs just no way for most of the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù folks to get out of the maze the creative, cognitive, corporate and political classes have built.  They just don‚Äôt have the time, interest or ability ‚Äî or they haven‚Äôt yet been personally confronted with some significantly crystalizing event that makes them look to other paths.Our betters are so skilled and experienced at constructing this that the targets of the deception can‚Äôt see out.  I remember how I saw things those long years; I actively read and questioned; I was wired to see the systemic conflicts, hypocrisy and craziness; I wasn‚Äôt happy with what I saw around me but still fervently, then wistfully, then desperately clung to the fantasy.  I considered myself as an out-of-the box thinker, and was seen and labeled that way by the organization I served. Took me years to make the break.Most of the regular folks, they haven‚Äôt got a chance.

I considered myself as an out-of-the box thinker, and was seen and labeled that way‚ÄùThat pretty much describes me as well. Was there any particular catalyst that led to the ‚Äúbreak‚Äù? For me it was a combination of two things happening at once. The catalyst was the Trayvon Martin travesty. The accelerant was having at the time an office mate who loved to argue from the progressive talking points. (Like three hours a day. During work hours. Would NOT shut up.) Said office mate was white (Irish), inherently intelligent, and about the closest thing to classically educated you‚Äôd find in these fallen times. I‚Äôm quite sure that office mate continually poking and stirring shit was what finally pushed me over the edge.Incidentally that guy now hates me. I was still so naive at the time that I believed it was possible to have divergent political views, yet still respect each other as colleagues and friends. Even though I knew it intellectually, I didn‚Äôt understand emotionally that for his ilk, rejecting progressive tenets is like going into the church and spitting on the altar cloth in front of the priest.

                It‚Äôs jarring to hear account of conversions that are so recent.  Some here seem to have put 2 and 2 together so long ago.

                    I wasn‚Äôt being clear, sorry. I‚Äôvenoticedfor a very long time, and been essentially in the HBD camp at least since I was in junior highschool (suddenly being introduced to the nontalented 9/10th will do that). The JQ thing after that, but no later than grad school. Putting things together sort of naturally followed.The ‚Äúconversion‚Äù was coming to the acceptance that the other side(s) view our disagreements not as political or even philosophical differences, so that we can still treat each other civilly, and even maintain friendships ‚Äúacross the aisle‚Äù but rather as morality plays where those not adhering to their supposed orthodoxy are flat out evil, as opposed to merely misguided or ignorant.But, as bad manners drive out good, I can play by their rules when needed. I don‚Äôt like it, and it‚Äôs dirty and lowers my value in my own eyes, but needs must and all that. So my personal conversion is more assertiveness, less civility, more use of mockery; basically not putting up with shit. The funny thing is that, so far at least, the positive results have far outweighed the negatives.

        Z Man;Here‚Äôs a added point of evidence thatWhy Nations Failis a conclusion in search of justification. The Amazon review you link makes a big deal out of S Korea‚Äôs prosperity vs N Korea‚Äôs awful poverty.How many people here know that S Korea is now a highly Christian country that sends missionaries to Europe and N America_? And it has been for quite some time. Looking around the skyline of Seoul even in the early 1990s I could hardly escape seeing crosses on substantial buildings at every azimuth.Cause, effect or coincidence_? Being a Christian myself, I‚Äôm tempted to lean towards ‚Äôcause‚Äô. But one thing sure of is that this divergence is not *just* due to ‚Äòdemocracy‚Äô, Cloud Folk fables to the contrary.P.S.

            Sperg;You are, of course, free to buy whatever you like, but for the benefit of other readers, I must point out that you are mistaken in your views.  I hope you‚Äôll reconsider.Re slave religion: Historically, some slaves were Christians and some were not. Some Christians were not slaves and some were.  Neither state is determinative of the other.  The Christian view is that there are two kinds of slaves, horizontal (slaves to other men) and vertical.  In the vertical dimension, a man is either a slave to sin and death or a servant (not slave) of God and life.  There is no middle state.  Your choice.  Can‚Äôt put the predicate of the Gospel any more simply than that.Marxism, OTOH, is a Christian heresy that posits that really, really smart¬†people (like meee_!), by manipulating other men through ‚Äòscience‚Äô, can direct the achievement of the promised Christian millennium here on earth without God‚Äôs help. ‚ÄòSo put me in charge_!‚Äô  The historical results (ought to) speak for themselves.MultiCulti is just a constant facile, nihilistic, self-serving critique of the existing social order of the day with no discernible higher purpose than making Karen (of either sex) feel good about herself, today.  Hence, just like with reparations, there can be no end point.  And Karen is never happy.  Nor can she ever be, because no end point.Nietzsche was a literal lunatic.  His loving sister used to exhibit him for money to pay for his care.  He evidently thought thataman (the super-man), through prodigious intellectual self-effort, could pull himself up by his own moral bootstraps to achieve a godlike existence for himself in this world.  But he also thought that there was no higher temporal plain and no God.

                If I remember my Philosophy for Dummies or equivalent, I think Nietsche said Judaism was the slave religion. He (or another author, perhaps?) claimed that, for example, the ten commandments gave the tribe(s) survival value as it encouraged behavior acceptable to the master (host) society. Given three thousand years, they‚Äôve almost switched places, some would argue!

        &lt;I&gt;People in modern democracies, particularly bourgeois people, need to believe that all people are born with the same innate talents and abilities.&lt;/i&gt;

This is a white thing, not a bourgeois or democracy thing.

It ties in with whites pathological altruism, over deference to authority and High rate of out-group preference.

Probably a biological imprint left on Europeans by a millennia of domination by the Christian church.

            I‚Äôve heard all my life ‚Äúyou can be whatever you want to be if you put your mind to it.‚Äù Americans traditionally took pride in the high degree of social mobility found in this country at one time. Many of the Greatest Generation were born poor, muddled through the Depression, served in the War and achieved prosperity afterwards. That was something they bragged about.
In practice, until recently, it was recognized that some people are just smarter than others or have natural abilities that others lack. A person really can‚Äôt be whatever he sets mind to be.

            Yes, one truism from Bible (or even earlier) is the golden rule. ‚ÄúDo unto others as you would be done unto.‚Äù I think this is verified in pschology too. Problem in practice: different people and different cultures may have dramatically different concepts of how me or thee should be treated. Closer to Stone Age your golden rule may be, as the T-shirt used to say, ‚ÄúDo unto others, then split.‚Äù

                ‚ÄúGolden Rule‚Äù? Oh hell no.That‚Äôs the rapist‚Äôs justification (see below). The proper thing is:Do undo others as they would have you do unto them. Within reason.
Golden Rule in action: Ibrahim really wants Becky to slam him against the wall, rip his clothes off, and have sex with him. Applying the Golden Rule, Ibrahim waylays Becky in the parking garage, rips her clothes off and has sex with her against her will.
Tell me where Ibrahim did wrong by the Golden Rule. He did unto her as he would have had her do unto him.

        Watching today‚Äôs comment parade go by, a thought‚Äî  Maybe ‚Äúour‚Äù dilemma represents the confluence of a couple of things.  One is that most of the white community is no longer meaningfully challenged by nature or by other elements of its own culture.  We simply only need to ‚Äúshow up‚Äù, but not ‚Äúaccomplish‚Äù, to get by quite well.  Couple that with a culture that shelters us from groups of truly smarter and more clever people (we get them, particularly Asians, in ones and twos, but not in an onslaught where we are the minority living among ‚Äúthem‚Äù).  This means whites have the luxury of buying into whatever explanation suits their world view and cultural preferences, because taking those views are meaningless in the real world.  Expose them to the realities of either needing to defend one‚Äôs own heritage culture and community in order to survive, or to try to eke out a living among strangers of another culture who are smarter and quicker than one, and ideas might quickly change up.The lack of meaningful real-world consequences for taking false views as truth, is the bane of our culture.  We still crack our heads open if we jump off of cliffs, but somehow have managed to buy into all sorts of half-assed ideas, without any consequences whatsoever.

        I heard a twist on Dindu Nuffinism by a purported Black caller to the Jesse Lee Peterson show. He claimed that Jesse shouldn‚Äôt concentrate on Black misbehavior because Americans as a whole incarcerated more of their own ‚Äî including Whites ‚Äî than other nations. It thought this was an interesting evasion. The caller was trying to submerge Black criminality into ‚ÄòAmerican criminality‚Äô as a whole in order to avoid looking squarely at Black crime.

        Jared Diamond was a geographer by education and an anthropologist by aspiration. Serendipitously for him, he was not born with a sufficient IQ to become the latter, and hence failed at real science, but succeeded proto-xerlscience. A healthy society culls the stupid, which is how all cohorts of our species advance.

            Tom;High IQ anthropologists_? Have you met any lately_? Asking for a friend.Pre the complete MultiCulti, soft Marxist pozzing of Big U, there used to be lively debate among the 5 or so competing anthropology schools of thought. One of those took the (obvious to me) position that cultures compete, some succeed, some don‚Äôt. So it took some IQ back in the day just to keep all the competing schools‚Äô arguments and their various bodies of selective ethnographic evidence straight. No more_! SJW Rules, Baby_! [best Austin Powers voice]So no more selection for Q, much less for IQ.The field went from studiously ignoring the very strong possibility that *all* 5 schools were wrong to now being able to simultaneously maintain cultural relativism and that white cultures are uniquely evil. Where did temporal success /=/morally good go_? The land of lost standards, I guess.

        Guns, Germs and Steel is a great book because it shows even lengthy up close exposure to diversity is useless in convincing the egalitarian that he is wrong.
Jared ‚ÄúLimestone‚Äù spent years among some tribe in New Guinea and even this up close personal exposure to the low iq natives did nothing to lessen his enthusiasm for his egalitarian worldview. They make Africans seem positively genius in comparison.
Worse, he just makes stuff up in the book.

            I‚Äôm not sure that they ever really thought about whether they believed their theories. It fit a narrative that works for them personally and their people so that‚Äôs the only truth they need.
They believe in their theories insofar as those theories reinforce a larger truth. Early medieval scholars were the same. Their writings were more concerned with the ‚ÄúTruth‚Äù than the facts. Current whites conflate the two, but, historically, they are two different things.

        I read Guns, Germs and Steel many years ago and found it very interesting and, initially, quite persuasive. The more I thought about it the more it didn‚Äôt make sense.To take one argument that does not hold up, Diamond argues that the reason most common farm animals are domesticated from Eurasian animals is that the animals of Africa and the Americas ‚Äòdon‚Äôt work.‚Äô After the end of the last ice age, and the pleistocene extinction, there is &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; case to be made so far as the Americas are concerned, at least in large land mammals insofar as there were simply fewer kinds left in North America compared to Eurasia, a ‚Äòsmaller library‚Äô to choose from so to speak. But with regards to Africa this is obviously nonsense. The reason why the dog came from the wolf, the cow from the aurochs, the horse from the wild horse and sheep from the argali or some Eurasian wildsheep, is all b/c the African equivalents were ‚Äòtoo wild.‚Äô It has, according to Diamond, nothing to do with the Eurasians trying to domesticate them while the Africans didnt. The Africans, so we are to believe, didnt have good material to work with, from the enormous variety of wild animals in Africa.History even proves him wrong. The cat and the donkey actually came from the African, not the Eurasian, versions. And in recent times there have been more or less successful attempts to tame animals like the eland (a giant antelope, about the size of a buffalo but with a far milder disposition; aside note, taxonomically there is no clear line between antelopes and cattle species; antilopes are, in a way, smaller and more elegant cattle species. And of course Africa has FAR more different kinds of antelopes than anywhere else on earth).Diamond is definitely a biology denialist.

        We have lost or are in the process of losing all the freedoms we assumed to be our birthright and that are explicitly called out as such in the bill of rights. Every day our society looks more and more like that of countries we were willing to go to war with. We as a nation committed many thousands of our own citizens‚Äô lives to forestall the spread of ideologies opposed to recognizing the rights we once took as guaranteed and prevent the assumption of power by its adherents. Not to mention justifying the many more thousands of enemy lives we took as well as just people who got in the way (which may in fact be the largest number of all.) All in the name of preventing the very practices and infringements we suffer today. Those infringements increasing in number and severity as each day passes as well. I think one of the best things to work on is impressing the plain self-evident truth of the above statements to current soldiers and officers.

        When discussing this book with a liberal, has anyone simply pointed out that in the book Diamond says that race differences resulting from selection are real (the Papuans)? Therefore it‚Äôs certainly possible that HDB white nationalists are correct (the racial hierarchy is reversed from what Diamond claims). That the harsh selection pressures on Papuans favors living in a stone age jungle culture.

        the good Christian, due to believing in man‚Äôs obvious sinful nature, also obviously noticed different tribes of men having different sinful natures. ergo, one can be a Christian racialist, as for example the segregated Catholic colonies in the Americas were for centuries, provided they don‚Äôt believe in mass miscegenation as a solution.of course, good Christianity has been dying since Bastille day and earlier. worse, it became infiltrated, by the supposed defenders of reason, which even in good faith brought all sorts of errors. this infiltration happened specially in the Prot world, where society was used to bourgeois life and literary criticism thanks to Luther and Calvin, and as such became very prone to buy into all sorts of deluded masochistic liberal Christian preacher tropes. all this against the backdrop of the industrial revolution funded by the gospel of wealth and natural selection fanatics, which destroyed: natural environments, natural worker‚Äôs guilds, natural towns, natural churches in white Christian Europe and usually white-led Christian lands elsewhere. thus these radical groups, seeing the destruction of old orders, first in the English Civil War and then the peculiar situations that led to Bastille day: first they would defend miscegenation of rights and responsibilities into some new hypothetical untested ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù universals, then eventually would defend miscegenation of classes in the name of defending those universals, and of course eventually they turned to miscegenation of races and groups. they had destroyed hierarchical order, they obviously engendered the seeds of the destruction of everything else. they were in league with their (((financiers and accountants))) too.suddenly, the ancient Christian prohibition on Jew usury was not so enforced, it was considered by the state and intellectuals and elites to not be too Christian and forgiving, and the secular state couldn‚Äôt give a damn if the priests were not in power anymore as long as profits and taxes were to be made; then as Christians dwindled due to the increased degenerate consumption, the secular state said it was too Christian to keep such a prohibition anyway.even Family Guy has name dropped Guns Germs and Steel. it‚Äôs one of those books white left boomer guys (who may be fathers to sjws and dirtbag left types) put on their book stand to seem smart. the same who may still watch Bill Maher. the book btw failed to question why whigs and leftists would promote more plant foods if they were indeed less nutritious, as well as questioning why today‚Äôs Africans are mostly the same but with phones and soccer tshirts now that they own their diamonds and oil. Why Nations Fail was an update for early millennials, more into the inclusion trend that started to grow as minorities started to have more influence in American life, even though most of these minorities are the most intellectual of their kind and cannot be used as an example of the future waves of mobs coming from the homelands in camp du saints style.so much is converged though, at the very least a cultural counterreform and political counterreaction of whites (and friends) will come. but it will have to be from a position of cultural power, which our side doesn‚Äôt have now. just look at the whole music industry shutting down because it‚Äôs pretty much become a coven of a few whigr secular druggy rootless wannabes, a bunch of thugs, many feminists and alphabet soups, and a lot of (((producers and execs))). that was just one industry. we have to create an alternate structure. larping helps visualize it, but it has to be brought to ground. example: Trump built some miles of wall and made a deal with Mexico; we can fantasize that he did all, or blackpill that he will never do more, and die in our basements blogging either way; or simply actively recognize current success AND push him to do more, without sperging or boogalooing‚Ä¶ unless really sorely needed.

        I am Christian and I completely disagree with you, however, I am not a Christian who believes the Semites to be a master race. They are a disgraceful race.Granted, there are people that rather go down on their knees and be punished for crimes they have never committed because it makes them feel righteous. I can tell you, I will not let myself be punished for my father‚Äôs sin‚Äôs, that bastard can burn in hell all by himself.Can we say the same about them the 12 tribes of Israel, that they conquer societies, noting superior intelligence is not the cause but out of opportunity and necessity.
