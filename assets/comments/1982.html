        Seems like we’re seeing the rise of the angry, macho street-wise intellectual, Victorian-era hipster male like Aaron Clancey or Gavin McInnes

        Slightly off topic but the moment McInnes ran out to tell us he had fucked over 300 different women, I switched off. Nothing to brag about unless you are attempting to appeal to the frat boy clique you were never really a part of to begin with. Vacuous hedonism – boy, I’m in awe.

            I want to like him, but my bullshit detector is often on 10 when he is talking about his past. Somewhere else I posted that he strikes me as a guy who missed out on a lot of his youth and is now making up for it by telling whoppers. I’m quite familiar with the under class and all the characters that pass through it. I can spot a faker when I see one.
