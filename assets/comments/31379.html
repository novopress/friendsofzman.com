        In a predictably recursive twist, the show this week rather partakes of the very problem it attempts to describe,viz.the limitations of domain-bound approaches to holistic problems. There are reasons other than “political brain” for people to be concerned about things like Harvard’s president, the Middle East, and Ukraine. These aren’t simply tokens on a political scoreboard; they have profound real-world effects that are quite serious, even if the discursive treatment of them unfortunately isn’t. The role of the concerned critic is to elevate the discourse to match the gravity of events, not to depreciate the events to match the facility of the discourse.About Harvard’s president, I wrote a post within the last few days describing why it matters. In short, the world always has a need for real scholarship, which the academic institutions of the land are supposed to fulfill. When such an institution elevates a plagiarist, fabricator, and obvious mediocrity to its presidency, it not only hollows out its core mission and undermines society’s trust in academia, it also paints a target on its back. There are thousands of academics who know in their heart of hearts that they could be a better president of Harvard than Claudine Gay. They aren’t going to sit silently by and put up with this. A scandal such as this will eventually destroy the institution if it’s allowed to fester. Nature abhors a vacuum, and that is the reason the empty space known as Claudine Gay was eventually squeezed out. It is the same reason that all of DIE will be eventually squeezed out, so this is a real and significant win.Concerning the Middle East, there is a very obvious reason why this region and its internal disputes have assumed outsized interest on the world stage. Setting aside the problem of Israel (which is a fraught situation that doesn’t fit neatly into any one category), the Middle East is a nexus of global energy supplies and global logistical chokepoints, as the Houthis are now demonstrating in the Red Sea and as the Iranians could very easily demonstrate in the Persian Gulf. Like it or not, the entire world has an interest in what happens there, because if Middle East petroleum exports are seriously disrupted, the economic consequences would by ruinous and would almost certainly result in a larger regional or global war. The relative stability we now enjoy is in many ways a consequence of Western imperialism, including the hated GAE, which is something that must be borne in mind by those who would set about dismantling it (about which I will have more to say in a moment).Likewise, the case of Russia and Ukraine has clear geopolitical implications because it threatens to bring two nuclear superpowers into direct conflict. The very possibility of this happening is the reason why the security architecture of Eastern Europe became such a pressing problem for Russia and why Western imperial meddling in the region was such a dangerous, reckless, and stupid gambit. None of this was very adequately explained to people in the West, who to this day have almost no understanding about Russian history, about the Russian civilizational state, about the geostrategic significance of Russian energy reserves, or about Russia’s pivotal role in Eurasian economic integration. The prelude to future world history is being written right now on the black plains of Ukraine. The Russians understand this and the NeoLibs understand this, but almost nobody else in America does.What these issues need—what they have needed lo these many years—is more trenchant and sober analysis by people who actually understand what is going on. It was not good to hide the full reality from the American people. The discourse must be elevated to match the gravity. What we do NOT need, and what I so often see among dissidents, is that willful obtuseness that wants shut its eyes to such things as if they were mere “political brain,” and assume a cantankerous attitude of Groundskeeper Willie provincialism: “I dunna care about the fookin’ Ukr-r-r-aine. I care about me grease, me shack, and MUH PAYPUL!” I’m sorry, but that’s not going to do it.As I wrote in a comment a week or so ago, which was obviously not very widely understood, I consider myself to be, politically, a traditional conservative who bites the bullet—one of the only ones who does. While I am consigned to the view that we must somehow wind down the Global American Empire, I am not under any illusions about the fact the immediate consequences for doing so will be wellnigh disastrous for America and for much of humanity. It will mean thepermanentend of much that we have taken for granted: prosperity, security, and opportunity. No one should come to such an opinion lightly; and while anyone can voluntarily give up prosperity for himself, to give it up also for one’s nation and one’s posterity incurs a grave moral responsibility. It is, therefore, all the more incumbent upon dissidents who agitate for the end of empire to face fully what their positions entail, and deprecating the whole debate as “political brain” is not serious. No earthly end could possibly justify the damage that the end of empire will impose. It requires an unearthly end, fortified by philosophy, to demand and receive such sacrifices. In this as in so many other ways, dissidentism remains the province of those who practice philosophy without a license.

            It is indeed an open question if modernity, as we have come to know it, can exist without the presence of some globe spanning empire to enable it. But to listen to you, one gets the sense that the recklessness of the GAE in bringing on its own demise is somehow dissidents’ fault. Regarding the fate of empire, we are irrelevant. The fringe of the fringe.The North American dissident knows that, unlike the vast majority of countries, AINO is indeed exceptional, in that it has all the resources it needs to be a self sustaining modern state without need of imperial support. Had different (better) choices been made a century or so ago, we would be that state right now. It can still be that state, although the transition from empire to continent sized Switzerland would no doubt be bumpy. If such a thing is possible anymore. More likely it breaks up. And when it does, that won’t be dissidents’ fault either. Anymore than the breakup of the Soviet Union was dissidents’ fault.

                Thank you for your reply, JZ.While the state of the world is not the dissidents’ fault, the state of the criticism most certainly is. A body of work that shows deep understanding; that is beautiful, profound, courageous, and self-evidently superior; and that demonstrates competence in handling the problems of late imperial collapse, would be the strong horse that really draws people into its orbit. You aren’t going to get that with warmed-over New Atheism and HBD sperg-outs.The true task of dissidentism is to form, as it were, a shadow government of sound and virtuous men to serve as a better alternative to the imperial hacks. You don’t need to worry about fighting a revolution when this kind of virtue fights for itself. When you think about it, this is the only realistic path from where we are today, to somewhere better.

            Another thing: Once DIE elevates a sufficient percentage of incompetents to leadership/management, then the system becomes incapable of reforming itself. In academia, we could very well already be there.

                For decades I’ve pointed out the Ivy League and many other so-called, “top flight” schools are utter jokes in terms of their operations and product output.
On a personal level, I’m glad the world is finally catching up to my correct perception.
Unfortunately, the reality of the DIE mess in academia, business, and government is going to have dire consequences for the GAE and everyone living in it.

                    What “radicalized” me, made me a “dissident,” was arriving at my assigned Ivy three decades ago and finding that everyone there was a fucking idiot (except like three dudes).
I enjoy ID’s comments, but the very big thing they entirely exclude is the (I think) fact that the project to end civilization forever has already succeeded, long before almost anybody even noticed that it was a possibility.

            But, for the average person (present company included), these topics are so far above their figurative paygrade that it is akin to being worried about the sun’s output. Hence, no reason to get riled up about them.

        Hahah, “creepy little Hobbit dude…” Eh, there are a lot of manlets on this side of things. Always has been present to some extent. In Shapiro’s case, the enthusiasts sputter “Jews backed him!

        Good to have you back, Z! I know, you’d be shocked, shocked, shocked with the tales I could tell about the assorted whackadoodles I met when I was active in the Libertarian Party. Though not the kind I’d socialize with in other situations, I find those sorts of people amusing. There were a handful of sensible folks in the mix, people like Ron Paul and Tom Woods, but I guess it says something about my psychology that I stuck with it so long. I enjoy the kooks, but it’s the sellouts, like the Reason and Cato crowd, that finally got me fed up with it all.

        Harvard is just the tip of the iceberg.Situated at the top of the pyramid, Harvard represents the entire world of academia in a nutshell. What goes on at Harvard cascades to all the other educational institutions.The Left-Wing control of the academic world is not as serious as the Left-Wing control of television. You could argue that both the world of movies and the world of universities are not all that relevant. TELEVISION is the big force multiplier.I have harped on this before. Most people watch hours of TV a day. They spend their lives saturated in the bath of small-screen dialogue and visual images. This is bound to have a major effect on their thinking.The TV is the instrument through which social change is effected. Which political alignment controls it gets to spread its message through the land.For some reason, Right-Wingers (I am not precisely a Right-Winger myself) cannot master the art of entertaining people while slipping them a cyanide pill of poisonous ideologies. If they could, we would live in a different world today than we do.[To read more of my writings, click on my name with your mouse]

        I think Sailer got the Covid thing wrong because he is a science/IQ worshiper. The mRNA vaccines were touted as this whiz kid, futuristic technology developed by people with lots of letters after their names that was going to end the pandemic. He also had his cancer cured years ago by a new cancer drug (Rituxan), which seems to have biased him towards Pharma. Science in the abstract is fine; science in the non-abstract is something else, distorted by commercial and ideological motivations, both of which played out in the Covid catastrophe.

            I used to think his problem was being a sucker for calculation, regardless of the trustworthiness of the initial data or the calculability of the problem—common nerd error, worst contemporary example “Scott Alexander” (Steve’s strongest man-crush).
Now I think he falls for everything Twitter women fall for because he’s a Twitter woman. He “predicted” (after it was already accomplished in elite circles he knows nothing about) the trooning of America because he wished for it. The elite position he resents society for unjustly denying him is autogynephile sociopath.

            Some people knew and didn’t mind being experimented on for humanities sake and for ‘progress’. But most people probably didn’t realize that aspect of it.
This month is supposed to be the end of the EUA experiment. I wonder what they have found out. They won’t tell us now, will they? But we remember they are supposed to, or so they said.

        “we shouldn’t be talking about Israel or the Ukraine as long as the border is open”Word!! Demographics is the most important issue of all.About litmus tests I don’t know if I have them but maybe I do. The thing is though, my positions on things move as things change. Bur more importantly as I realize more and more how crazy this all is. I keep shocking my old self but OTOH my old self has views incongruent with a collapsing civilization. So if I really wanted to know if ppl are legit I might ask them “tell me one important issue you’ve changed your mind on ib the last five years”. Because if your name is not Julius Evola or Sam Francis or something on that level I don’t believe you had it all figured out from the start. I don’t believe anyone really thought we’d be trying to atop the state fron mutilating children today. Just think about how evil and F’ed that really is. Makes me wonder where the hell our death squads are just to think about

            Moran ya Simba: “Demographics is the most important issue of all.”True dat.But the illegal alien invasion is not our biggest demographic problem right now…==========Bill Gates Insider Warns of Massive Population Plunge in ‘Highly Vaccinated Countries’2024-01-05https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-bloggers/4208042/postsVideo here:2023-12-15https://twitter.com/VacSafety/status/1735741766257754346His prediction [30-40% mortality in highly vaccinated countries] comes in the very last few seconds of the twitter video.==========Here’s an official-looking website [which itself might or might not be a psy-op] that claims only 18% of females in the United States remain pμrebl00ded…https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/==========If worst case scenarios prove to be true,  then the other 82% of females will likely be either completely barren &amp; sterile [i.e. unable to even conceive an unborn child], or will be producing stillbirth after miscarriage after stillbirth after miscarriage over the course of the next several decades.If worst case scenarios prove to be true.Our biggest problem is with young fertile females having been forced to be jabbed with the v@xxines, for purposes of e.g.A) Pursuing undergraduate studiesB) Pursuing Grad Skrewl &amp; Professional Skrewl studies &amp; certificationsC) Engaging in research at universitiesD) Health Care employment [nurses, doctorettes, pharmacistes, physical therapistes, occupational therapistes, etc]E) Teaching in gubmint Elementary &amp; Secondary Skrewl skrewlsF) Being enlisted in the MilitaryAll of the above classes of studying or employed females will have been heavily v@xxinated, and are at extreme risk for producing miscarriages &amp; stillbirths, not to mention experiencing outright sterility.There are millions upon millions*** of such females, who should have had perfectly good fertility, but who are now all v@xxinated.==========***rough estimates follow…&gt; 330 million warm bodies in the USA&gt; 165 million female; 165 million male&gt; 82% of females v@xxed&gt; 18% of females pμrebl00ded0.82 * 165 = 135.3 million v@xxed females0.18 * 165 = 29.7 million pμrebl00ded females==========Those are not good numbers, muh Bros [and of course, muh Sistuh, 3g4me].Those are not good numbers.

                Just finished watching “Children of Men” and it seemed eerily omniscient, what if to our horror, only dark skinned illegals had the capacity to deliver live babies. In my area, the only children I see are offspring of Mormons or Mexicans. Intelligent white hetero couples see all too well what kind of a world they would bring children into and have opted for partying on the edge of the cliff so to speak, who can blame them?

                Being demographically invaded is about as bad as can be
Not all vax batches may have been equally bad. We will have to wait and see what happens with the vaxx time bomb. But it looks to be another major thing.

        A bit of a TLDR non-sequitur re “ethno-nationalism” in theory vs applicationIn theory, sounds great I guess, but when I’m out and about i see plenty of whites I wouldn’t want to necessarily have as neighbors, not even addressing the leftist componentAlso, I visited family in my old hometown over the holiday. Aside from the recent mestizo influx it is pretty well 50/50 black and white.I always dread going out to restaurants as I don’t know what random person from the past I might see.While out this time I ran into a black guy I went to school with from 4th-12th grade, first time seeing him in 20+ years and it was a very nice conversation, and in retrospect, I think I preferred running into him vs some of the whites I knew back then.Not saying I want to move him in the guest room, but he was just a nice blue collar guy who was sincere and enjoyable to catch up with.I can’t say how that relates to my intended topic,  but it does in some way.More recently, I became pretty well-acquainted with a black gentleman with who our kids shared a sports team.  This is a Christian-based program and he home schools his kids and was overall a just a nice guy and someone I would be unopposed to having as a neighbor.I know the above are anecdotal and statistical anomalies, but I find it hard to make the “ethno” portion a hard and fast rule. I would need some exception criteria both ways.Just being honest here and open to downvotes or insights from my fellow travelers.I think part of my perspective is being from the rural South where interaction frequency is much higher, and being Gen Z, I came up in a time where race realism was a bit more the norm both ways and jokes could be made amongst races and the “N-word” could even be used in certain cases without getting stomped out (like when some fine AA gentlemen pulled my chair out from under me in class…)

            Race realism doesn’t deny that there are intelligent and “nice” negros. Even the (many) feral ones are capable of comporting themselves the majority of the time. If you’ve ever seen the movie The Last King of Scotland, whether intentionally or not it makes the point that Idi Amin was a swell guy 98% of the time.
Whites may have dumb political ideas and such, but they are a whole lot less likely to shoot and rob you. They are more trainable. It just so happens that these days many of them are getting poor training.

There’s a reason JJ told the story of how, when hearing footsteps coming towards him at night, he would be relieved to discover they were whites.
Joe is Joe. It’s their nature to be subhuman. There is a reason Africa is still in the Stone Age.

            James Proverbs:  We’ve all met and dealt with those famous ‘exceptions.’  The point is, though, they are exceptions.  The different racial bell curves are real.  The bigger problem with these supposed exceptions, though, is that people don’t think through what it would mean long term.  If you have a 95% White community and 5% of various-hued ‘exceptions,’ what accommodations will they demand and will the White majority be guilted into making?  Special blaq holidays?  Special mention of their patron saint MLK?  Teaching all the White children that all the blacks are equally special exceptions and there’s only a handful of ‘bad apples’?Who are those 5% going to date and then marry?  Will they eventually miscegenate and all the Whites end up with a bit of whatever in their genome?  Do you instead permit them to marry someone of their own race from outside the ethnostate and bring them in?  When do you cap their population?  How do you deal with the exception’s ‘cousin’ or stepbrother, who is not an exception but wants help by living with his fambly?  What about the children, and reversion to the mean (it’s a real thing by the way)?Mr. “X” may well be a decent guy, but you have to think in social rather than just personal and individual terms.  It’s thinking of the individual and denying the mean that has lead us to today’s racial animus and chaos.  We were never meant to live together.

                ^^^. This.  Spot on.  Also, as nice as your black friend seems on the surface, behind closed doors he hates you and wants you dead.  He supports political candidates because they look like him and not because they’re good for “America”.  He will ALWAYS side with his own in a situation that involves you and another fellow feral.  He views himself as a victim of “White supremacy”.  You’re falling for the same thing that color blind civ nats fall for.He can’t deny his DNA.  At the heart of it he’s a low impulse control, violent savage.  Given the opportunity it will explode out of him.  He’s just a bit more reserved about it on the surface.

                To be fair, the problem hasn’t been the existence of the minority, but the forced integration and promotion of them.  Minorities have been present in America since its founding, but the forced integration and promotion has been relatively recent.  Given that removal is highly unlikely for the foreseeable future, efforts should be focused killing AA and promoting freedom of association.

            A complaint I’ve heard many times about Japan, a near-ideal country where I lived for a few years (and don’t now because I’m not Japanese), is about the gruesomeness of its criminal violence. Japanese gang and serial killings, unsolved disappearances and unidentified remains that imply horrors unimaginable, and kidnap-torture-rape-murders (of schoolgirls who were just walking by!) are legendary.Why? Why are THEY LIKE THIS?!Considered for a just moment, the illusion fades: If you get murdered in Japan, a *murderer* did it. Yuto the Ripper got you because who else would? Whereas if you got killed in America, it was because a black guy shot you for $25 (that he dropped as he fled), or because you looked at him, or because you were there, or because you’re not black, or maybe because you are.OK. Now:Why are “white trash” so offensive to my sensibilities?

            It’s weird because as awful as some black people can are, they’ve also been among the most outgoing and kindest folks I’ve ever met, even in the current day. White people, sad to say, have mostly become paranoid even about their fellow whites. But just last weekend, a black fellow sitting next to my wife and I and the theater turned to us and said, “wasn’t that an awesome movie we just saw?” His enthusiasm was very endearing. Says something about having, on average, a higher tolerance for risk, even if it’s just social risk.

        Apparently I lack a Political Brain, because my first question whenever someone new suddenly pops up is, “Who’s funding him?”Had this happen with the local ballot. Shiny New conservative candidate pops out of nowhere, vying against our established hard-ass conservative congresscritter. Shiny New said all the right things. Blue collar working man, hard-rock miner, knows the score, etc etc. Well, through the simple expedient of backtracking the outfit that paid for his mailing, I discovered that his major backer was the AFL-CIO. Yeah, just who I’d expect to back a GOP, wouldn’t you? Concluded Shiny New was probably a trojan candidate.BTW, it works with everything. Frex, if you backtrack funding for The Daily Yonder, which purports to be a magazine promoting rural interests (of course that’s intended to echo as “conservative interests”), it turns out most of their money comes from the Open Society Foundation.

            No, you’re right, Aesop went sideways. Before CoVid, he was mostly solid so far as I could tell, but about that time, he went off-the-wall nuts. My guess is he loved calling people names so much that he started posting what he knew was crap just so he could make fun of people with reasonable arguments and questions.But lately I’ve been wondering how much of his earlier stuff was right, too. Was his take on Ebola right, or was that as batshit crazy as his take on CoVid? If it were half as bad as he claimed, most of Africa would now be depopulated…

                Very much doubt he’s of the Tribe since is some kind of ER or ICU Nurse and must actually get his hands dirty doing his day job. Presumably became one via military and GI Bill. So even less likely.Just a Boomer Nutter who can’t move on from the old world commie hatred. People do get stuck in mental ruts as they age. More so often if they’ve lived for long periods under very high stress levels… Prolonged stress seems to cut a deep groove I’ve noticed. Perhaps also a Pole or something similar to add spice to the Russophobia.But away from Covid and Russia he’s useful for prepping info. There’s a whole bunch of people who are a bit insane or give off a bit of an occasional vibe — the magnificent Big Country (*), Aesop, Bayou Renaissance Man, etc… But there’s gold in them that hills along with the nutty dross. You take the rough with the smooth.Can’t remember his name but there’s that other total mental case who thinks everyone he encounters in daily life is surveilling him.. but also wrote some great stuff about amygdala hacks back in the day.All to the good. These guys go over the top in the first wave :).* Should have his own reality TV show. Home made flame thrower included.

                        I’d be very careful about misunderestimating Anonymous Conservative.
Yes, he’s cray-cray.
But also, yes, his underlying thesis is undeniably true: They’re watching everything we do.
In fact, some d@mned gl0wn!gger at L@ngley or F0rt Me@de or C@mp Wi11iams is undoubtedly watching my fingers type these words in real time.

            If you check out the title assigned to his post at WRSA, Aesop: Lying with Half-Truths – ironic if ever there were – I think you will have your answer.
I started to read that post from Aesop, but after it became clear that it was a self-indulgent exercise in out of control invective, I skipped to the comments for light instead of his unrelenting, incandescent hatred. Some commenters tried to introduce counterarguments (a big concession on their part given that to which they were responding…) but were usually greeted with another tsunami of hatred for their pains.

                Actually, Trump had been peripherally involved for a long time. There’s video of his congressional testimony from 40 years ago where he’s saying the exact same things he did when he campaigned, and talks about how to fix what was going wrong.
Vivek, tho… talks a lot, doesn’t say anything. That is, says what people want to hear, has no solutions.

                A glance at his face is disqualification enough, but the Vivek of only a couple years ago was exactly the full-on establishmentarian that literally every Indian Republican is. There’s a whole book of NeverTrump/antiwhite/etc. boilerplate with his name on it.Pretending to be a GOP “populist” is very easy. All you have to do is not lie about normal people. The one point in the shitter’s favor is that his hatred of the average American is weak enough that he *can* hide it—almost. He can’t bring himself to betray “legal” immigrants, which is always the tell. Valuing the “best qualified,” “hardworking,” etc. immigrant over the best qualified, hardworking, etc. American citizen—usually heightened to outright denial that qualified hardworking Americans (white men) exist—is the inflexible core of conservative/business/Republican anti-Americanism.The white Christian fetish for refugees, black adoptees, third-world converts, “natural conservatives” of the near South, etc., is a personally perverse variant of this, “internalizing” the capitalist/corporate/Jewish superego (and murderous/sexual id) as self-righteous ego. The right edge of “normie-con” love for Vivek—”he shouldn’t be president but I hope he’s Trump’s press secretary”—is tainted by this.

                A couple days ago a viral video went around in which he “destroyed” an obviously planted audience member who took him to task over his lack of support for mutilating adolescent cross dressers.  Lost was the fact that his answer basically amounted to, “let people do what they want in the privacy of their own homes — hell, let adults chop off their bits and bobs as they wish — but allowing kids to do so is a bridge too far!”In other words, he acceded to most of the degenerate left’s morality, leaving just a small bit of mop-up work for them to do down the road.  But excited normie-cons worked themselves into a lather because he sounded like a real tough guy giving this answer.  “Dems are the real transphobes!” can’t be far behind now.

        even when i was very liberal, I would place a lot of weight on personality as opposed to ideology. For instance, Bernie Sanders was considered by the chattering classes to be the more liberal and extreme candidate in 2016 over the more electable Hilary Clinton. Yet it didn’t seem that way to me.In my view, the phrase “too liberal” and “too conservative” are merely proxies for temperament. When people think of a democrat being too liberal they aren’t thinking of ideology as such. When someone says they are too liberal what they usually mean is that they are an Aaron Sorkin liberal.https://thefederalist.com/2024/01/02/aaron-sorkin-is-the-real-villain-behind-the-senate-sex-scandal/Now what I’m talking about isn’t entirely the same thing the Z man is talking about, but I feel it’s at least in the same orbit of thoughts.

        Zman – your point regarding litmus test issues resonated with me (and for once, I actually listened to the podcast – watching it snow outside, enjoying the fire in the woodstove, and listening to Zman’s wisdom!).  While I have my opinion on issues like abortion, I was always able to agree to disagree with others.  Even as my position shifted and clarified, it was never the determining factor with me as it seems to be for others.But moving from mindless liberalism to conservatism to HBD realism and finally ethnonationalism, I find I have definitely found my “litmus test.”  Yes, Covid certainly signified a host of other mental deficiencies (blindly trusting ‘authority,’ terror of death, virtue signalling, etc.), but my one issue is now ethnonationalism.  If someone is uwilling to recognize and respect the differences in genetics and culture and nation, then I cannot accept them as a thinking, rational individual worthy of conversing with.This issue, which is of such vital importance to my children’s future, is non-negotiable for me.  If someone will not acknowledge and accept the right of White people to exist and live as White people – with all the culture and habits and peculiarities and brilliance that entails – then they are someone opposed to all I value.  They are an enemy – and I make no apologies for such a black and white belief and statement.Unlike some here, I don’t have old liberal ‘friends.’  I moved on and severed contact.  I may treasure memories of old times together or generosities bestowed, but the future they want and work for is antithetical to the wellbeing of my sons.  And to me, placing the well-being of one’s progeny  (and that means physical, mental, and spiritual health) as central is what it means to be a parent.For the women here, please note I do not say ‘luv.’  Caring for one’s children is an action, not just an emotion.  And it includes rejection when they embrace evil, because morality is not something ephemeral to be discarded based on ‘feelings.’

            The guys wisdom? You people are morons idolizing a racist pseudo philosopher/historian. I commented two years ago on this cesspool site ridiculing (accurately) the delusional paranoid rambling of the aforementioned loser, and that of you simpletons making absurd new years predictions (which never panned out; funny that). You fucking people are nuts!

                    Not really.  Trolls post to excite and disrupt—never to initiate reasoned conversation regarding points of differing opinion.  All I saw posted from Brian were a string of ad hominem attacks, too vague to be rebutted or even understood.
Let’s see if we can count the words Brian used; moron, racist, pseudo, delusional, paranoid, rambling, cesspool, loser, simpleton, absurd, nuts.  Indeed, remove those words and you’d have no idea what Brian posted about.  Such does this angry little man consider the art of conversation.

            “Yes, Covid certainly signified a host of other mental deficiencies (blindly trusting ‘authority,’ terror of death, virtue signalling, etc.), but my one issue is now ethnonationalism.”
Yes!  The c-v1d crackdown was nothing compared to demographic replacement.
This is a litmus test for me too.  If you feel more threatened by the oppressive government response to c-v1d than massive immigration, then, well…  you’re not very smart, sorry.
(I’m not saying that the c-v1d crackdown wasn’t threatening!  I’m saying that it’s like worrying about high blood pressure when you’re dying of cancer.)

                Line:  Agreed.  Covid repression was a symptom of an already decayed, non-White AINO.  And the blind trust in the government was not a feature of American life before Lincoln’s War, at least so far as I have read.  Personally, I would blame mass immigration (Irish, Italian, Poles, Jews, etc.) for the way the public welcomed FDr’s poison pills.  Government would save them!  I don’t think the first homesteaders believed that.

                    3g, I’m with you but with one stray thought.  As far as I can tell, the failed painter’s big government reforms did resurrect the German people in a remarkably short period of time after WW1.  Small government in Germany after the Great War would have meant that everyone died alone.  If someone can show me otherwise, I’m very interested…I remember how perplexed Dennis Prager used to get over the success of Germany in the late 30s because it defied all of his small government beliefs.  Of course, the antebellum USA was not Weimar Germany (and I’m not saying that you are like Prager).Sometimes big government is the only solution.  I’d rather just say “fascism for white people.”  My guess is that this is true for our people right now.  Once we’ve got a homeland then we can set aside a spot for those who want to minimize government and we’ll see how it goes…

But as I’ve been repeatedly reminded in real time, most people cannot figure things out and need a lot of assistance and direction.  Theoretically, after a generation or two of such a society would have accrued sufficient social capital and habits that government intervention and direction could be minimized.

                        I wonder how big an efficient White-run “big” government would need to be sometimes. Let’s see, some kind of national health care, good roads, reasonable regulation of airwaves, air traffic, environmental quality, public schools with strong moral codes and high academic standards, a “defense” sector that actually just focused on defense and not imperialism, and of course strong border enforcement. How much should all that really cost? More than the 18th century federal government certainly but probably not *much* more than the libertopians’ minimal state. After all, in a sense, this would BE that minimal state.

        Unfortunately, “normal brain” isn’t that great either.  People fall for the most obvious cons and believe obvious lies even in their day to day lives.  This is especially true for topics they don’t know very well. Not to mention the emotional investment people have, particularly in politics.

        Conservatives get a thrill up their legs over the rare “victories” such as the Gayfenestration because they imagine their brilliantly logical keyboard critiques compelled the Leftists to finally see the error of their ways, repent, and return to the side of light and virtue. (Bloody idiots.) But, as Z points out, this changes next to nothing. Oh sure, Harvard, and by extension academia, is temporarily smarting–so to speak–over this incident. It registers as a setback, albeit a small one. Their reputation takes something of a hit in the public eye. But it’s nothing more than passing discomfort, like gastric spasms after chuffing a tainted scallop.Not a single Leftist has changed his views one iota. Harvard will not change its policies. They won’t even devote more diligence to actually studying the personal background of the freaks they hire to be future presidents. There will be no strengthened bans against plagiarism–that would be a case of disparate impact, dontchaknow. Instead, they will erect more robust firewalls to prevent outsiders from doing the background checks that places like Harvard refuse to do on the dusky and perverse pets they endeavor to promote to the pinnacle of their deranged hierarchy. In other words, look for more of the same only worse, because now the malefactors will be even less accountable.

I believe this is true.  Last I checked, Michelle Obama’s Princeton thesis was now not available for download or online reading (I had copied it previously however). If you find it, please correct me for the group.

                I forget where I read/heard it (maybe it was here), but someone was suggesting that they’ll probably make those academic publishing sites walled off to everyone outside of academia as opposed to just having to pay if you aren’t enrolled.
So the university system will start operating more like some kind of ancient mystery cult where they hide all their weird rituals from the public view, likely becoming stranger and stranger until they’re sticking small animals up each others’ asses as “research” to the machine god.

        This was a great show start to finish. That list of goofballs was fantastic. I had the same issue with Fridman’s promotion on YT. I never bought it. A guy who is an AI genius and pioneer who spends his time interviewing famous people? No. He would be working nearly 24×7 with the other AI pioneers.This was truly a great show Z-Man. You do a great job staying sober in a time where it is easy to get drunk on the endless casks of outrage this regime has on tap. Thank you for the reminder. Best of luck getting set up in WV.

I had nearly the exact same reaction to Fridman (Fraud-man?).
If the guy really was on the bleeding edge of AI, his time would be consumed by that. He would be known for that, not his podcast.
It is also very weird how he seemingly materialized from nowhere to get top shelf guests, millions of subscribers, and millions of views.
Based on this, one has to wonder if Fridman is some kind of glow op.

        Haven’t had a chance to listen yet, but I will rephrase my comment from two days ago. The great thing about the Gay firing is NOT, as the media and conservacucks would have it, that a great blow has been struck against DIE.  Gay didn’t lose her job because of DIE, or even for plagiarism. She lost it because she crossed the Jews. Blacks know this, even if normie doesn’t, and are quietly seething.
Long term, this will cause problems for the Democrat’s ruling coalition, and that is a wonderful thing.

I wish Ramaswamy would let fly with some Sikh jokes. The cognitively more with it Indians — Brahmins, Jains, etc… LOVE to tell the Sikh equivalent of Dumb Pollack jokes.

        I’m still grappling with the JQ. Yeah, I used to buy it, but I’ve started looking in the mirror more lately. In the The Lobby documentary Z linked to, Mearsheimer was talking about the problem with the Israel is that it is a Jewish ethnostate, and if they permit immigration of the more swarthy, they will lose their culture. Well, isn’t that our point?Or the bit referenced in today’s podcast. That they are influencing things on campus. Well, who isn’t? It’s not like Zoomers, for no reason at all, each on his own, started thinking men in dresses was admirable or that losers should be permitted to smack down women in sports. Someone was doing that conditioning, and at a level widespread enough that would require substantial funding.The only real problem I’m still left with is Jews are smart enough to turn some of the aid dollars into campaign contributions, which gets them more aid dollars. Nothing particularly nefarious about it. Just garden-variety corruption, same as anyone else buying off politicians.

            “Someone was doing that conditioning, and at a level widespread enough that would require substantial funding.”Gee, I wonder what group has that kind of money and desire to warp traditional Western/Christian culture. Dang, it’s a mystery. Nope, can’t think of any group like that.“The only real problem I’m still left with is Jews are smart enough to turn some of the aid dollars into campaign contributions, which gets them more aid dollars.

Why, look at those Chinese. They do the same, probably worse. I mean, China’s a lot bigger than Israel.I’ll give you credit, when you lie, you lie big. You might even call it the Big Lie. Best of luck to you here. I suspect that you’d do better at Boomer CivNat sites like Breitbart. No one going to buy your Jews are just another group argument here.

I think bribery ought to be legal, accepting a bribe a capital offense plus asset stripping, and anyone providing evidence that leads to the conviction and execution of said politician is given a reward paid out of the property seized.Rest of that is justad hominem.

Nope. No Jews in Hollywood or the big TV networks or newspapers/magazines over the past century.Oh, and Jews have had no influence over academia either. I mean, it’s not as though six of the eight Ivies at the moment have Jewish presidents. Wait, what’s that. Six of the eight Ivy presidents are Jewish. Well, that’s just a weird coincidence.Oh and Jewish donors just got two Ivy presidents fired for not kissing the Jewish ring hard enough.Seriously, are you an intern at whatever organization that you work for. You need some more training.Regarding bribery, you want to shift the focus from who is doing the bribing to those getting the bribes. Interesting, you want to shift the focus away from Jews. I’m stunned.Also, you’re either an idiot because you don’t know how the political system works – it’s not backroom bribes – or you do know and are lying. The way that politicians get paid off is legal, you twit.Look, I get it. You’re doing your job, which is to move attention away from the Jewish community when the spotlight turns in its direction. Make it seems as though Jews are just another group doing what everyone does or point your finger at China or whatever. That’s fine. Just be more subtle about it.You can do better. I have faith in you kid.

                        Sigh.No, I get that media is pwned by Jews, etc. I have a zoomer daughter, and whether because of parenting or her innate intelligence, never fell for any of that crap, neocon or neolib, apart from a brief fling when she was 16 and dyed her hair blue.But from what she says, zoomers aren’t paying attention to the legacy media anyway. It’s all social media, particularly TikTok, which I’m sure Jews would love to own, but don’t appear to. Yet.And Ivy League? I don’t give a wet fart about Ivy League. I’m more concerned about the state and community colleges where this leftist bilge is being peddled. Tens of thousands of rich elitist snobs are being influenced? Couldn’t care less. They were that way going in. Ask Tom Woods about his experience at Harvard.I’m more concerned with those straight-laced midwest kids going to state schools and coming home for Christmas tatted and pierced and hating whitey. Something changed them, and in schools where there are like 3 Jews in the entire state.And don’t be silly. I know apart from morons like Biden, no one demands suitcases of cash. The same is true of tax evasion, though. If you have too nice a home or too many nice cars for your income, the IRS is going to go snooping. Unless you are a politician, evidently.

            The JQ largely comes down to the fact that they are the best at playing this game.  They have also weaponized peoples’ sympathy for what happened in WW2 and criticism of them impossible.
Though I think they are going to continue to lose to the Indians who if anything are even more ethnocentric than the small hats. Indians ran them out of the diamond hustle with ethnocentrism.
Frankly, I think  the Indians are much bigger problem. There are a few 10s of millions of small hats. There are over a billion Indians.  Plus they are extremely corrupt.

Right. So execute those who accept the bribes. The IRS can track down people whose lifestyles or assets are not consistent with their paychecks. They can do it. They just don’t. So make it plain. Anyone, including IRS agents, who provides evidence that leads to an execution of a politician or bureaucrat that is living beyond his means because of corruption gets a cut of the property seized. Maybe 10%. That can be adjusted as needed to get people to investigate corruption.

                I live Northern Virginia which is maybe the largest concentration of Indians in the country, certainly one of the top spots. I’ve been saying for a few years now that people, especially Jews, have no idea what’s coming with these guys.The Indians immediately started getting into local politics and organizations – and not because they are civic minded. They love to own businesses. Any business, they don’t care. The also love owning rentals.Indians look at blacks as wild animals. (Can’t fault them there.) They view Hispanics are working animals. They view working class whites as barely human. They view middle and upper-middle class whites are marks for the con. Finally, they admire how the Jews operate and use them as a template – but they have no love for Jews, seeing them as competition and the current power holders.And, trust me, they don’t want to be under Jewish control. They want their power base and are working to build it as Jews sleep.

                    Citizen:  Texas has Virginia (and most other states) beat when it comes to Indians, Han Chinese, Vietnamese, Koreans, and Filipinos.https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/09/2020-census-dhc-a-asian-population.htmlNew Jersey is up there, too.  But your assessment of how they operate and view other races is spot on.  As soon as they are minimally eligible, they start running for schoolboard and city council.  And they don’t even attempt crypsis, like Jews – they put up placards with their birth names, and host nation colors (no fake red/white/blue stuff).And that’s also what’s so suspicious about Ramaswamy.  He is trying to present himself as mister all American, a voice for the dispossessed White middle class.  He’s a snake, and I am waiting for someone to really dig into who is funding and pushing him.

                        King Cobra definitely came through the elite portal. But I get the feeling that the Cobra is playing a different game. He senses that there’s an opening, and he’s playing it.I don’t think that he wants to be just another house slave of the global elite. He wants his own plantation.None of that means that he’s on our side. King Cobra is out for King Cobra. But the fact that he understands that taking up the mantle of whites is a path to something big, something outside the power of the current elite should tell us something.The global elite are losing their grip and showing weakness. People like Cobra, who want power and glory but don’t want to be under someone’s thumb, know this and are angling for what coming in the future.Cobra most definitely isn’t on our side, but he’s a good sign.

                The Jews are “better at playing the game” because they’re white, like Jared Taylor says. There’s no mystery here. Sure, they’re generally intelligent too, but basically on par with northern Europeans and East Asians. The races that can “play the game” in the West will be the ones that can present themselves as Huwhite best.And make no mistake: as much as we Online Right love pointing out the DEI madness and diversity worshipping, the fact is that anyone anywhere in power in the West acts as Huwhite as Clark and Nancy Woodall from Ames, IA. Look at Rishi Sunak: dude is probably whiter than me. Claudine Gay is whiter than some of the Jessicas I’ve met in mobile home parks. We are living in a white nationalist utopia right now; problem is that no genuine whites are allowed to rule.About those Indians: they are really good at acting white. Some of them have goofy accents, but they’re countenance is all Caucasian. The Indians will inherit the West. This is foretold. Ramaswamy is but the canary: there will be more like him, and more based. There will also be a lot of white-hating progressive Hindus like Ash Sarkar. More Hindus means more of everything. In 50 years, we’ll wish the Jews were still in charge…Finally, the Chinese. They cannot act white. They’re particular eccentricities and cultural baggage prevent them from inheriting the West. They are eternally East. Plus, the East has been and always will be the Middle Kingdom. They do not want to inherit a lowly upstart kingdom such as the West. They don’t even speak an Indo-European language, nor do they care to. Their best shots are Andrew Yang and Michelle Wu, and that’s the highest the Chinese are going to go in the Occident. Plus they’re too quarrelsome to overtake the West like the Hindu can. The Chinese will sell themselves out for 50 grand and a hot stock tip. The Hindu thinks ahead.

Are you permanently suntanned?  Seriously, there is no way I could get a complexion like Sunak.  And there is no way anyone would mistake the Indians I’ve seen (and was unfortunate to live amongst in Texas) as White or even White adjacent.  By color, physiognomy, habits, or accents.  Same goes for the subcons I dealt with in England, and in Jamaica, and in Singapore.  Same people and same behavior wherever I encountered them.

                    I don’t know about that. From what I’ve seen, whites, even liberal whites, don’t buy into the “my fellow whites” argument from Indians – or Asians.
When Indian start lecturing whites about their white priviledge, you see the whites immediately get edgy. Blacks can do it. Jews pretending to be white can do it. But Indians can’t, at least not around the people that I’ve seen.

            This is going sideways from anything useful.If the DR had the kind of funding Israel has, do you really believe we wouldn’t be pushing the message on college campuses?If you want a white ethnostate, why are you upset about a Jewish ethnostate? I mean, some reason other than envy.If the DR owned the media, wouldn’t we be putting the stereotypical 50s family in commercials, rather than the race mixing, pedo-adjacent, perversions we now see?As I watched the video Z posted, The Lobby – US, what kept popping to mind was the popular meme of pencil drawing of a couple neckbeards pointing at something, mouths aghast. Yes, there were some things there that prompted me to look a little more in depth, but most of the time I was just thinking, “Yeah, if I had their resources, I might try to influence the kids, too, but in a way I like. I’d at least try to counter influences that I don’t like.”

                    Again, sideways. We agree thatwhatthey are pushing is an abomination. I think we agree that the means being used are not. At the very least, we’d use them if we could, right?
All I’m asking is why the emphasis on the messenger, rather than on the message, where I think it belongs.

                        In case it wasn’t obvious, I think getting people to at least consider DR politics is a whole lot easier if you focus on the message rather than immediately jump to race or ethnicity, something that will get an immediate visceral reaction to most of the people who are amenable to argument.Who is the audience? Apart from Brian green, above, there’s no one here to convert, so what’s the purpose?There’s also little point in taking this tack with Lefties. They will brand you a hater and reject it without even bothering to consider any argument.Most of the Right is susceptible to being called “racist”, so they will ignore whatever you have to say, too. Think Derb.I just see it as a good way to permanently sideline the entire perspective. I’m disappointed at what little counts for refutation here, basically slander anyone insufficiently pure on the JQ.Taylor is also proudly racist, but he puts forth facts and statistics to support his arguments. Is that really too much to ask?

                Steve:  I’m going to sound offensive; so be it.  Are you deliberately trying to be obtuse, or is it supposed to be not-so-subtle misdirection?  I don’t see anyone saying that those with the money and media ownership pushing their message is innately devious.  What people are saying is that it’s unnatural that 2% of the population should own that media and craft the message and thus viewpoints of the majority population.  People are noting that for some reason, no one with sufficient resources shares or is willing to publicly push our position.And a number of commenters here – specifically Citizen of a Silly Country – have noted that they only wish that Whites had a fraction of the ethnocentrism that Jews have.  The way the have defended and agitated for their people is admirable, if one considers the existence and fate of those people important.  What people resent and argue against is the utter and blatant hypocrisy of those same Jews insisting no White/European may have similar ethnocentrism or agitate for its own people and culture.  People here notice that the Jews insist they alone must have a homeland, but White nations must be open to all.It’s really not complicated.  Counter influences one doesn’t like?  At present that is only available to those willing and able to lose their livelihood, any social network, and have their children and parents lives’ threatened.  That’s what people are ‘noticing’ and why they resent Israel’s funding and media microphone.  Particularly since most of us are paying for it, against our will.

As an unapologetic white separatist, I have a pretty thick skin.Why the false dichotomy? Did you watch the video Z linked to? I don’t recall any of it talking about the 2% ownership, and, so far as I noticed, you are the first to have mentioned it, at least in this blog post. Even our host called out the practice of there even being a presence on college campuses influencing the youth, as if that were something nefarious. I mean, it is, but that’s because of the message, not the presence on campus.Maybe this part of the JQ is all sub rosa. If so, I’m sorry for the misunderstanding. I missed the memo.

                        Steve:  If I understand you correctly, you are opposed to calling out the messenger as opposed to the means and the message.  Why ought Jews (or Armenians or Greeks or Turks or Banglasehis) be able to attend American universities and politically and culturally proselytize White American youth?  Why ought we accept any ‘diversity’ – religious or ethnic or racial – in our nation?  Do we not have the right to determine who we wish to allow access to our youth?  To what message is being broadcast?The whole ‘melting pot’ and ‘we’re all Americans’ bit appears to me to be the basis of your argument.  I reject that.

Yeah, I reject that, too.
I’d vastly prefer to be left alone to discriminate however I damned well please, but if I can’t have that, a white ethnostate is a distant second choice. Distant, because I know for a fact there are a lot of stupid whites who, for example, think socialism is peachy keen, and who are bound and determined to stick their noses into my business.

                No one cares about the Jews having an ethnostate.  They can do their best.  However, their co-ethnics and biggest supporter here in the USA are on the front lines of the open borders movement in the USA.   Reliably. They are a disproportionate share of that destructive ideology while on the other hand,  those same Jewish Americans vigorously advocated for a beautiful wall to keep the bad people out of Israel and they support a highly selective immigration process where you literally have to have the right DNA to join the Israeli club.  Pisses many us off to no end.  Now toss in their endless sanctimony about the Jewish people being a blessing to the world while at the same time murdering Palestinian children and you have a bad feelings among the white gentile masses of America.

                Well, Steve, coming to this late after reading many responses to you.Why are we white people increasingly noticing the incongruities between your position and theirs. Yeah, they can have their (shitty little) ethnostate, but it is premised – totally – upon usnever getting to even  entertain this for ourselves. Why? Because we are their talmudic cattle: we are expected to financially underwrite their ethnostate (with a substantial portion of this being dedicated to bribery/blackmail within our political and judicial systems); being expected to share the military technologies and intelligence that they need to overawe their neighboring polities, and simultaneously ignore/forgive  whether they sell or barter these sensitive technologies and intelligence to our disadvantage with antagonistic powers; and finally, when it comes down to it, to sacrifice the lives of our military fighting wars resulting from their arrogance and malevolence toward people whom we need not antagonize (witness the current Middle Eastern situation, or past costly wars).All of their catspaws – AIPAC, the ADL,  Southern Poverty Law Center – without exception focus laser beam on thwarting any consideration of our people’s aspirations toward a group identity. Oh, they screech, think what happened the last time some white guys formed a white ethnostate! Oh, bullshit, they really only need US to be their big, compliant, thug. So they can kiss my ass.

                At this point I have to conclude you are not in good faith. No one on the DR begrudges Israel of being an ethnostate. The DR begrudge jews demanding Israel be an ethnostate and using all their resources to prevent White nations from being White ethnostates.
Even more so, using the resources of White nations to prop up their jewish ethnostate to the ruin of ours.

            Steve, folks here know I’m pretty agnostic wrt the JQ.  However, I just read a lengthy piece:
https://windsorswan.substack.com/
on Windsor Swan’s substack.
The article is directly readable here (assuming I get it copied correctly):
https://windsorswan.substack.com/p/the-social-parasite-theory-of-liberalism?utm_campaign=reaction&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_content=post
It is called the Social Parasite Theory of Liberalism.  Really a remarkable analysis of the JQ.
Worth a read.

                Thanks!I’m about halfway through. Down to the section on Jewish psychology. Some of it is certainly better than others.For example, his take on loan interest is completely absurd. It’s not the money. Of course if it’s just ones and zeroes, they go away on repayment. But only an idiot would focus on just the ledger balances. Say a  man takes out a loan to build a house. If immediately repaid, sure you could just cancel out the credit and debit columns. But once he spends that money on 2x4s and concrete and shingles, those are real tangible goods, which the loan covered when the vendors submitted invoices. At this point, you cannot just cancel out the columns because there are both assets and liabilities sprinkled throughout.There are many areas I don’t have the knowledge base to even consider, though. For the nonce, I’ll just have to assume he’s presumptively right, though I will mull some of it over, knowing that in at least in his economics, he doesn’t know what he’s talking about.

                        It is not so much the interest, but the recourse. If you loan out for the house, but your only recourse for repayment on default is the house, then your lending practices will be far more prudent and less exploitative.

            The JQ is often one of the biggest hurdles on the journey from conservative frustration to outright dissident who wants a new system. It was for me. I would start by reading Israel Shahak, the Jewish Religion. It’s a short book and you can find it online. Perhaps even start with Ron unz’s review of it.
You don’t flip on the JQ overnight. Unless you’re really old, that would require undoing a lifetime of conditioning. That takes time

                I did flip on it more or less overnight. I used to be as rabid about the JQ as what I’m reading here, maybe moreso, and more or less over the course of maybe 5 minutes, realized my beef with Jews was more a beef with collectivism and perversion. I’m even told to hate the evil, not the man.
Thanks for the reading recommendation. Maybe I’ll come back around to the “correct” answer. Stranger things have happened.

                    None of us have “the correct answer” in a political sense. The DR is not bolshevism central.What surprised me, and I have quite a few Jewish friends and colleagues, was how hateful Judaism is towards goys. I always thought Judaism waa some sort of “love your neighbor” proto Christianity. It is nothing of the kind.You said you flipped on it overnight. That’s the opposite of my journey. I still struggle with it. I honestly wanted it to be BS because my personal experiences with Jews are overwhelmingly positive. They’re often academic geeks, same as me at heart. But I vant help but think “what comes easy, goes easy. What comes hard doesn’t go easy ”I can’t tell you what the right answer to the JQ is. I could tell you what I think. But what you need to decide is, after genuinely studying it, what you really think

                        “I always thought Judaism waa some sort of “love your neighbor” proto Christianity. It is nothing of the kind.”Exactly. If they know and are being honest, they will tell you flat out that they are not followers of what they call “Hebrewism”, basically Pentateuch theology with a dash of prophets for flavor. The modern version of Judaeism is Talmudic, which spawned the Pharisees. So modern Jews practice a religion that Yeshua explicitly condemned.They are a lot like Muslims in that regard. As individuals, it’s hard to imagine the things we are told about them. But the ones who are like that probably do not really understand the Talmud or Koran as applicable. Keep ’em ignorant, and if they stumble over the truth, there’s always expulsion from the benefits of the tribe, or somewhat more harsh measures from the Islamist…

            They can do whatever they want in their own country.   To the extent that they commit serious crimes in support of their country to the detriment of our country then there should be serious sanctions.Like stealing nuclear material so they could build their A bombs.   That should have resulted in military action to the point that it made the theft pointless.Former CIA officers have noted that Israel has been a far greater national security threat than the Soviets ever were.    It should be national policy to not trust them at all.   I don’t consider Ben Shapiro a trustworthy American because we all know where his and all of the rest of their loyalty lies.  Just the same as the Chinese.   Although I don’t think the Chinese are as dangerous.It goes without saying all foreign aid to them should be stopped.

        I don’t know. There’s a difference between a successful guerrilla operation that causes relatively minor but spectacular damage and a decisive battle such as, say, Gettysburg.
This is a matter of opinion of course, but most dissidents I am reading recognize that Gay’s ouster is an example of the first and not the second.
Yes, some have painted this as the second and not the first, but these people will always be with us.

                When it made the AP go so far as to blame scalping on White people, and show what ridiculous asses they are, it made a difference.
It showed their agenda, blameshifting, clownish ridiculousness, and it was insulting to everyone’s intelligence.
I’d say that is a big loss for them.

            A guerrilla operation by whom? A lesbian black female appointed as president of Harvard to spout anti-White hatred forgets herself and allows a little venting by pro-Palestinian students. This really upsets some Jews, so accusations of plagiarism are dredged up and she is forced to step down (while still being paid under her contract). One of the Jews who was running the school all along has to step in until a new anti-White figurehead can be found who better knows her place. While there is much humor to be gained from this, I can’t really characterize it as a victory for dissidents.

                    Firstly, Celt, I didn’t down-vote you. Some count this as a win and that’s fine. Second, I didn’t say this was a defeat for us at all. If anything, I thought it was rather funny how golem created to go after us have at least temporarily failed their creators, while supposed color-blind conservatives have become raging ethnonationalists where Israel is concerned. I’m just not expecting it to last. Now if the next Harvard president should dial back on the anti-Whiteism or, barring that, curb the wild over-representation of Jews at that school, I’d definitely count it as a victory.

        Spectacular show, Z! 👍It’s incredible. A lot of people go off the rails before they ever get on the ride. It doesn’t even occur to them to use the tools they have. That’s one hurdle… using that tool properly is the second.I still remember my shock when you used to teach Xirl Science. Your experts’ flawless credentials were all presented, their works were read…and then their biographies were brought up in excruciating detail and the result was lethal hilarity and comedy.I felt like the ape on 2001, confronting the big black rectangle…”using the innernet to research topics and people of interest??? It was sheer genius! It promoted our guys, and was absolutely devastating to the bad guys!…”. This kid must be one of your honour students…https://gab.com/Glenfilthie/posts/111698245816228482To be fair, cluelessness is fostered by short attention spans which are in turn fostered by the net. We live in a remarkable age where you can go straight to the horse’s mouth with a click of a mouse and some quick reading – without having to bother with the horse’s ass! A LOT of people out there are still not aware of this. Lack of info in this day and age should be a crime.

        I think the biggest problem we have, is that nobody can be forthright. The entire construct of a multi-racial democracy with its untenable arrangements compounded by the age of mass media is a non starter. Everything is a lie, or an act of submission in the form of swallowing the truth heavily seasoned with cowardice. Moreover, everyone is pitted against each other. Even if the cast ballots don’t really decide, everyone thinks they are a decider. You don’t decide, but you take a stand and the simulacrum of conflict resolution we call voting stokes the flames.The system is so absurd that you literally sit down at the dinner table and spend New Years day with people who support your country’s destruction and your people’s annihilation. In the interests of civility you say nothing. You live a second life on the outside preparing the resources that your loved ones who are worth saving will rely upon.I checked in for the first time on the territorial war raging in the Levant with our money and our occupied vassal state’s complicity. Here is a quote from their Defense Minister: “Gaza residents are Palestinian, therefore Palestinian bodies will be in charge, with the condition that there will be no hostile actions or threats against the State of Israel.”Bodies will be in charge? In broad daylight he tells you, they’ll put up bodies in buildings and give them titles, but the brains making the decisions won’t be in the bodies that will live under threat. In the article is a picture of Lloyd Austin next to the Israeli DM. Look at that dope. I can’t help but think of Claudine Gay. Lloyd Austin and Claudine Gay. What do they have in common? Well, they are the black bodies who will be, “in charge”, under strict conditions. One just got bagged as the external conditions changed.Who put them in charge and under what conditions? Someday the answer to that is going to blow the roof off of this place.A clown world makes most men and women act like clowns. It is a challenge and accomplishment to maintain your dignity and comport yourself with grace and strength. If we can do that and inspire two youngsters in our lives to do the same as we help them become competent, we’ll pave the way for them to forge the better days that lie ahead.

            Another note – the people in Gaza are residents. You know that language is also used to describe Americans in our homeland very often. I think King Cobra let slip that kind of language last year – something about, “people who are permitted to live here.”
We are not citizens nor are the people of Gaza. They are, for now, permitted to reside – on someone else’s undeveloped beachfront property.
Always listen to the language someone uses.

Agreed. So why is the resident/citizen distinction so important to you?
BTW, I upvoted your post. I’m just not sure why I should care how they are categorized.

                    Resident/Citizen distinction is important in a context that may or may not exist in our current state of affairs. In a homogenous nation that has its own country, citizenship is a status with privileges above that of a mere resident. It is a status with privileges that also connotes duties and responsibilities that must be fulfilled to be maintained. A resident has lower status and privileges and its own obligations to maintain it. I also use citizen in its highest value sense of nationhood and not citizenship in some multi-national imperium.If by some miracle we make the necessary changes and have the will to do what is needed to peacefully restore this country as the sovereign homeland of its European nation that distinction will once again have proper meaning and sufficient gravitas. Should we do that, we will for a time need to figure out how to split citizenship classification along pre and post 1965 lines.As for its distinction in the Levant, it is not relevant to me. It is for them to work out. My point there was the language used in that quote is the currency of the realm. It reveals a mindset and a way of thinking about the world. I hope that helps.

                        I agree again, and again, upvoted. It’s just in the world in which I live, it’s largely a distinction without a difference. I think we may already be beyond the point there is even a distinction in America. It’s no longer just dead people voting. Now we are adding invaders and imaginary people to the voting rolls.
We used to have ade factoethnostate in America until we did not, and are soon to the point of a white plurality. Pretty soon it will be hard to make the case that white America is anything more than residents.

                    Steve:  Language is a reflection of thought.  It both reflects it and shapes it.  That’s why the early communists – or the earlier internecine Christian wars – focused on language and terminology.  You say you understand the importance of the language someone uses, yet you question the difference between the classic meaning of ‘citizen’ versus ‘resident’?This blurring of vital and concrete differences is what enabled the abomination known as modern birthright citizenship.  It’s why a foreign ambassador’s son born on AINO soil remains a citizen of his father’s country only, but that same ambassador’s driver’s son is the beneficiary of magic dirt and reaps the rewards of AINO citizenship.Way back in 10th grade Honor’s English, a lot of students – myself included – who had been accustomed to easy ‘As’ for years – were perturbed at receiving failing grades on paper after paper.  And then one day I wrote one that I thought was far too simple and straightforward and resigned myself to a “D” only to receive my first “A” from my eccentric and demanding teacher.  Classic ‘lightbulb’ moment.As an aside – I just checked and found that teacher’s obit from June of 2022.  She had a profound influence on my life, and I regret I never looked her up and thanked her.  She was from West Virginia (God definitely has a plan for each of us  – and a sense of humor!)

No, I just question why a Gazan’s designation should be my concern.

        I quickly figured out that Shapiro has only a couple of purposes in life – gin up support for Israel, protect the right flank of mainstream Republicans, keep normies distracted and outraged about the irrelevant stuff.
Same can be said for all “conservatives” still on mainstream platforms like Hannity.

        Great point: how our “leaders” love to get us all wrapped-up in the ongoing foreign dramas which have no effect on us— Israel and Gaza, Ukraine and Putin— hoping we’ll *miss* the things which *do* directly impact us; like the demise of our freedoms of speech, assembly, and association.

            I think that’s giving Our Leaders too much credit.
They too get wrapped up in the irrelevant foreign crap, because it’s much easier to launder money there. It’s even easier to launder money when you have promised your foreign donors a lack of border enforcement so they can quietly dispose of their angry young men.
If the irrelevant foreign crap distracts the proles, bonus, but not the goal.

        Right in tune with today’s theme, Jason Kessler has once again provoked a divisive public cluster.  Nick Fuentes has caused him to become an agnostic.  Or something.  And he had to make a grandstanding statement about it.Fortunately this time there is little chance that anyone will be injured or end up as a prisoner or an informant.On one side there are some realists and the Christians of various stripes, while on the other are some realists and the anti-Christians.If the comments under Kessler’s pronouncement at Contrary-Currents are any indication, the anti-Christians are a loose affiliation of atheists, libertarians, pagans, sodomites, and some aging degenerates who have a track record of bad life choices.Speaking of which, Costin Alamariu (the Jewish homosexual also known as BAP) is also out there stirring the pot about something else.It is all so tiresome.
