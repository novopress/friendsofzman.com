        If any of you want a real scoop on the Ukie Ruskie schenanigans, and Zman take note, look up the Slavlan Chronicles on substack, Rolo Slavskiy, and check out his interview with James Corbett on the Corbett Report . Com. You all can thank me later!

        The Progs and neolibs have an answer already to your ‚Äúwhat sort of society ‚Äú questions in the last paragraph, they were quite open about it until the Ukrainian war kind of hushed the tone;
Empire.
They don‚Äôt want rights, they want Empire and they rule.

        As someone from New Mexico, this is greatly offensive! Let me speak with your manager, Z Man! Actually completely accurate though. If you didn‚Äôt average in all the indians and mexicans, probably the same IQ levels as anywhere else.

            I wish NM no ill will. I‚Äôve visited a few times and it‚Äôs on my list of places I might relocate to, if I ever tire of Florida‚Äôs humidity.
Your comment is akin to the occasional DR observation that, if solely statistics of American Caucasians were used, the USA would compare favorably with ‚Äúbest‚Äù in virtually any (desirable) category in the world. üôÇ

                The observation you allude to however is almost universally a response to a (false) comparison of the USA to some predominately White country on some social statistic, like ‚Äúmurder rate‚Äù per capita.  It is a way of reminding people of race and the social maladies that follow race mixing.

        ‚Äúwhat sort of social arrangements can we have in the diverse and stupid future?‚ÄùConflict, and lots of it. This leads to a jackboot crackdown on civil liberties, individual freedoms, and dissent on a very broad scale. Think Stalin‚Äôs purges to the gulag, and you‚Äôll have a good idea of what to expect. With the few remaining intelligent ‚Äúmalcontents‚Äù out of the way, the elites will be able to sleep easier knowing that there is no one left to threaten their rule. We will have become a nation of eloi and morlocks, as predicted by H G Wells.Or we can foresee this outcome and then use our intelligence to oppose this fate in an efficient and humane fashion. Smarter, not harder.Natural evolution will be pleased.

        In a continuation of a thread I posted yesterday, is sohrab ahmari (and the late Christopher lasch) saying the same thing I was saying?
Meritocracy is something I support in theory, but I feel like it simply ends up becoming a credentialocracy.

            Man is fundamentally susceptible to corruption, and so every institution we create will also be susceptible to corruption. The problem is not a lack of new and ingenious institutions but a war against corruption and immorality.

        I know our side likes to focus on the race part of the great divide in IQ and competence, but the reality is that the quality of whites is declining too. Whites aren‚Äôt as intellectually curious or willing to put in work. I can tell you from my experience with recent college graduates at my job, most, if not all, utilize ChatGPT enormously to complete papers. They don‚Äôt do the work anymore. These are whites. Things are going to be very bumpy indeed.

            It‚Äôs not only that. Even if they are motivated society does not make the effort to develop the competent Whites. With the decline of education, and what little that is left being given to those who don‚Äôt merit it, a guy who could have been a great engineer ends up being a low level tech or machinist.

            How high IQ you need to see that somebody with dick is a man and somebody with  the        other thing is a woman? 70 should be enough. On the other hand there is something called mad scientist. Seems that there are plenty high IQ people with mental issues. in country where I cme from there is an expression ‚Äî Peasant common sense.

        Speaking as someone above 135+ and a bit older, I can tell you the stupidity is so motherfucking palpable now, it‚Äôs outrageous.You can hire people with 20 years experience from a company that‚Äôs been around for 50 years, and they barely understand the basics of their profession. You may as well teach yourself whatever it is you need done these days, if you‚Äôre smart. Anywhere I go I expect abject stupidity and problems. Think what it‚Äôll be when these covid babies come of age.‚ÄúThe question then shifts from what can we do about it to what happens as the population loses the ability to maintain the social systems?‚ÄùEffective people go hide and watch you eat each other. At least that‚Äôs what my wife and I are doing. We live minimally and more so each day. I for one won‚Äôt bail out society anymore.

                You better fucking believe it, miforest.
The one thing I wish I could change though in my life is having more children. But our daughters talk about having 10 kids and we encourage it.
Teach your sons to be men. Some of us have been protecting our daughters from even seeing globohomo. I‚Äôm not even exaggerating. Good, wholesome, white Christian girls who love to cook and mind the house. They will need good husbands.

        I think New Hampshire will continue to want to be in the same country as New Mexico. Their lack of diversity is the reason. They are living in a nearly all white bubble so they can romanticize diversity. If you read reviews of Northern New England towns on the niche.com website many people say their city is lovely but complain that it lacks diversity.

            They think diversity means a great new Thai restaurant; not street tacos riddled with C. diff and the effluvia of Tijuana, in all of that word‚Äôs senses.  Just look at California to see what the current trajectory proffers. The Aztec reconquista will be complete when the civic buildings run red with the blood of sacrifices.

        The future is France. Specifically, their ongoing low-level civil war. Which seems to be flaring up now. Eventually, France will see the imposition in the Cities of an Islamic Republic, with general physical purging (liquidation) of Whites and also enslavement, and Whites fleeing to the countryside in a years long civil war. Since that is how Muslims are, their society is basically founded upon the low IQ enslaving the higher IQ from outside societies: al-Andalus depended on the Viking slave trade of Ireland, Wales, Scotland, England, France, and Germany. Baghdad and the Abbasid Dynasty relied upon the Vikings selling the Slavic tribes of Russia as slaves. At no time ever did Arabs ever work for a living, they are simply incapable of it.And no one should be deceived about North America. The stupid hate the smart, always have, no matter who they are as Amy Chua noted in ‚ÄúWorld on Fire‚Äù about how market dominant minorities, be they Igbos, or diaspora Chinese, or Lebanese, or Indian disaporas in East Africa, or Tutsis, generate hatred from the less smart, adept, and networked. The incoming head of the JCS, GQ Brown, is intent on removing 43% of White officers and enlisted / non-commissioned officers etc. and replacing them with blacks. About 80% of blacks demand reparations for slavery, the minimum per California is now bid at $25 million per black person, and like France public morality is based on the genetic evil of Whites, particularly and especially straight White men, and the hereditary blood guilt of same. ‚ÄúAfter such knowledge, what forgiveness‚Äù per Sailer‚Äôs observation quoting TS Eliot that Straight White men created 99.999999% of the modern world for good and ill.What is striking about the Spanish Civil War was how it was pushed by the myriad, competing, and utterly crazy and disorganized but socially strong Socialists/Anarchists who wanted to destroy modern society to create utopia. The Communists by that point were the sober ones with little influence trying to keep (futilely) the socialists from doing insane things. The Military only revolted when the police with socialists thugs arrested some Monarchist and murdered him under official policy after about two years of electoral fraud etc. I will leave analogies for readers. The socialists really hated the clergy, btw, and enacted brutal tortures and humiliation of their corpses in public which revealed them for what they were. By contrast, I cannot emphasize this enough, the small cadre of Communists were sober and sane with limited aims.

            The future of AINO is not France. We don‚Äôt have nearly that high a percentage of muslims, nor likely will we, and our negros don‚Äôt have anything at all that resembles the cohesiveness, organization, or moral structure of the French muslim diaspora. Nor most likely can they ever. Chaos may be the future of both, but beyond that I don‚Äôt expect that many similarities. Incidentally France remains much more white, over 80%, though also more shitlib.

                Scary.  Because alotof Merican blacks are turning to Islam- more and more as the Africans pile in.
That‚Äôs what (((Eli Wallace))), aka Elijah Muhummed after his treatments, tried to do with Nation of Islam.
Create a breakaway religion for a breakaway state.  They wanted Mississippi as a raiding base.
Islam is quite suited to blacks, they respond to its simple discipline, kinship structure, and militant fecundity.

                    Credit where due: unless I‚Äôm mistaken, Nation of Islam advocated black separatism. A large nation like USA attempting a one-size-fits-all legal, moral, and ethical system for increasingly fractious diversity cannot stand. But in a future devloved world with de-facto autonomous states, perhaps it could happen. Of couse this might be a world of warring city-states, but at least we could dispense with the pretense that we can all live peaceably together. I suppose certain regions could try ‚Äî good luck to them!

        New Mexico is a case study. You‚Äôve got affluent white yuppie shitlib Santa Fe, yet drive just a few miles up the road and you see the Pueblos living in their shacks. But what makes Santa Fe seemingly prosperous is not so much white competence as it is largely people being paid with fake money to work fake jobs. The residual leftovers of competence. And all worshipping, at least superficially, the New Diversity that will degrade their little utopia. Making it more like high crime Albuquerque.That‚Äôs the present, that‚Äôs not the future. The future is frighteningly hard to predict. It‚Äôs hard enough just to predict who will win a sportsball game. As Santa Fe becomes more vibrant and less safe, whites will flee, because that‚Äôs what whites do when this happens. But to where, and to do what? I think that answer depends a great deal on how well the fake money holds up. I don‚Äôt believe whites will change their currently errant ways unless/until forced to by a new economic reality.

                That‚Äôs if nothing else changes, like the economics of the situation, which was really what I was getting at. Yes, as long as the fake money retains value, shitlib whites can shelter in their enclaves, wherever they may be. But these enclaves are no longer built on competence. They are, today, built on fake money. This is the key point. Were they built on competence, they could hold out where they are forever, hypothetically.
And fake money Sante Fe vs the shacks around it is kind of present day western civilization in microcosm.

            Not even a gay white man, ‚Äúincluded.‚Äù
Leland Stanford created that university so that the descendants of the men who built, ran, managed and sustained his railroads could be intentionally locked out of his law school.
Biden‚Äôs judiciary appointments are no different: out of 97 only three white men:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_Joe_Biden

                I‚Äôve wondered how long they will leave Leland Stanford‚Äôs name on the university. I expect university names would be about the last to go in the Great Renaming, markers of prestige that they are. Why Yale is still Yale.

Going to be interesting to see how this gets enforced. The Left will of course ignore it and continue to engage in business as usual under some thin veneer of sophistry. Unless some future administration is willing to send the 101st with bayonets fixed into colleges the way Eisenhower did in Little Rock in 1957, the Left is simply going to tell the Supreme Court to fuck off.

            No, the left has already shown us their response to banning affirmative action. Ironically, it‚Äôs completely on topic for our post today. In California, and in schools around the country, schools simply eliminate all objective measures for admission. Lots of high profile schools either have optional or explicit directions not to send SAT or ACT scores. The only ‚Äúobjective‚Äù measure used is class rank/gpa. However, we know the valedictorian in Lagos is much different than the valedictorian at a rich private school in terms of IQ. What we will see is schools rushing to eliminate SAT and ACT, in the next few years, very few will accept them.

        For reasons as yet explained, the ruling elite of the Global American Empire embraced these vague notions of equity and diversity because they solved some unexamined psychological need or maybe they were deemed useful in promoting group solidarity.There is actually an explanation for this. The reason why the elite strata of society prescribe these rules for the rest of us is because their prescriptive ethics are what I like to call ‚Äúthe ethics of the market square.‚Äù If you think of the global empire as being the crossroads of the world, and the administrative center of the empire situated in the sprawling market town, then it‚Äôs clear that the chief administrative task the empire will set for itself is to enforce a very blunted form of universal politeness upon everyone so that the tranquility of the souk is maintained.None of us little people are allowed to have a problem with someone else‚Äôs race, nationality, religion, or sexual perversity, because that would upset the market and result in more work forthem,and we all know that every ruling power strives to make things as easy for itself as possible. The elites prescribe behavior for you which will keep you from annoying them. This also explains why they do not practice what they preach. One of the perquisites of elite status is that you are allowed to have preferences. They don‚Äôt apply the ethics of the marketplace to themselves.They will force you to sit next to trannies, and embarrass yourself with diversity struggle sessions, and take away your gas stove, because as a consumer-unit your opinions are worth nothing to them. Only your compliant, predictable behavior matters. Why tolerate a washing machine that wants to eat expensive beef and go to Mass on Sunday? Just feed the thing corn mush and relativize his religion until it‚Äôs pointless, and then work him even harder.This will inevitably end, because ultimately the roughest and toughest hombres out there are the sort of men who care little about ruling over a market square full of NPCs and they end up smashing the thing out of recklessness if for no other reason.As for intelligence, there is more going on there than meets the eye, but more of that in my next.

            You presuppose far too much rationality from the Power Structure. Insane Clown World is not the calculus of the souk. It is the result of an intellectual sickness that manifests in the hatred of everything beautiful, lawful, rational and normal‚Äìin other words, whites and their civilization. This is rooted in the postmodern narrative, which is explicitly antiwhite. Moreover, if your concern is with multicultural harmony, the last thing you do is wantonly antagonize the largest culture in the ‚Äúsouk,‚Äù i.e. whites. And yet that is precisely what they‚Äôve been doing since the mid-60s. No, no‚Äìthis is a clear demarche against whites, and it is motivated by malice. Delude yourself at your own cost.

        First, it is TOO LATE as Zman said.  We‚Äôre going majority-mino no matter what.  Far, far too late to stop that.Second, I enjoyed the phrase ‚Äúsea of vibrant stupidity.‚ÄùThird, even before mass im-vasion, we were subsidizing stupidity through trashing of all standards and especially WELFARE.  I‚Äôm of the opinion that adults should clearly understand that they are responsible for providing for their kids and realize that if they don‚Äôt have the money they have to go beg to the local church or whatnot.  But giving r-selected people a safey-net (and then some) will cause their population to explode quickly while simultaneously depressing the population of the k-selected.Welfare makes CUCKS of all of us.

            The problem with this requirement of self-reliance is that people have to be willing to watch the unfit and unlucky die in the street.
Most people can‚Äôt endure that, even if they agree with your arguments on an intellectual level.
Most people want a social safety net.  To deny the majority this wish requires an authoritarian libertarian government, which is kinda funny.

                I‚Äôll add that we are much likely to be able to enforce eugenic requirements on welfare, like work requirements for the able and if you have your second kid while on welfare that you have to be sterilized, if we have a homogeneous group.
These requirements will still make some compassionate whites crazy, but we have a far better chance of enforcing them in a homogeneous state.

                Watching the unfit die in the street might be called Nature‚Äôs morality. But wait, Nature doesn‚Äôt have anything of the sort. She has her inexorable laws. The fittest tend to survive. The less fit tend to die out.As discomfiting as imagining the above might be, permit me to show you yet worse. How about a society that exacts swift, brutal punishment on wrongdoers? For example, adulterers were stoned to death by a crowd in the Old Testament. Equally savage punishment for perceived serious offenses still occurs in some of the backward parts of the globe. In many Islamic nations, hands and heads are still lopped off in the market square. Most Westerners are aghast at such barbarity. Yet I grudgingly concede that these violent cultures take their morality (law, religion, etc.) seriously, far more so than the lukewarm equivalent in virtually the entire West.The safety net or its related ideas, like a duty to protect the weak, are unquestionably the cornerstone of most major religions and democratic governments. Problem: what happens when everybody wants to be caught by the safety net, but there is no one holding the net any more?

            I think welfare also explains the incel phenomenon to some degree. Lower and working class women can indulge in their basest desires when choosing who to father their children. With no safety net these same men who today are baby daddies would be a devastating choice for women. Incels tend to have conscientious stable personality types and would return to being husbands and fathers‚Ä¶the old provider beta role.

            Yeah, that‚Äôs the wild card. I actually surprised that it hasn‚Äôt already started.
Get ten fertilized eggs, do a DNA test on them with existing knowledge of various markers and choose the one with the best odds. Hard to say the impact on any one birth, but over thousands, you‚Äôll end up with much more of whatever characteristics you screened for.

A woman in my family already had two mail order babies, sired by some tall, blond PhD. She got one that‚Äôs somewhat above average and one winner who loves school, aces all his tests and spoke fluent English by the time he was ten and can switch between British and Valley Girl accent.

‚ÄúI browsed a couple of donor websites looking for a father for a hypothetical child I‚Äôm not ready to have, and things got kind of intense. After much deliberation (shouldn‚Äôt I try and have a mixed-race baby because I‚Äôm mixed-race?) I finally settled for ‚ÄúNoller,‚Äù only because his personal message choked me up a bit.‚Äù
Sure, lady. The fact that ‚ÄúNoller‚Äù had blond hair and blue eyes was entirely coincidental.

                    There are two ways this kind of thing can ‚Äúwork‚Äù. They both seem like sci-fi today but historically were the norm. The first way, common throughout the ancient world and in places like the American South, Apartheid South Africa, was to have a minority elite ruling over a large class of ethnically different peasants, slaves, etc‚Ä¶ The other way is the ethnostate. Modern Israel is one, there might be a few other examples I‚Äôm ignorant of. Once enough based Whites move to Tennessee, NH, or some other state like that there‚Äôs a possibility of setting that up here as the DC regime crumbles. In Europe, you guys have places like Hungary, Belarus, maybe even Poland if they can junk their NATO-globo government. Of course, Russia, while not exactly an ethno-state, seems pretty far from switching to a rap version of their national anthem and spending entire months celebrating anal sex. Even China, underneath all the ‚Äúcommunism‚Äù is pretty much a Han ethnostate.The key to both forms of un-democracy of course is crossing the cognitive rubicon of realizing that democracy was always meant as a tool, not a religion. By that I mean that undemocratic states can *use* voting, political parties, parliaments, etc‚Ä¶ as a way of sorting out bad ideas, bad people, and bad laws, but that your society needs a moral, ethical, and *ethnic* foundation that isn‚Äôt about what 51% of barely human hominids think.By the way, I‚Äôm not saying that crossing that rubicon is a sufficient condition for a good, functional, livable society, only a necessary one. China is a nasty totalitarian hellhole that locks people in their homes out of fear of Coof (but really as old-fashioned commie-style terror) for instance.

Right now, we‚Äôre still firmly in control of Western Europe, even if Britain is going over the edge fast.
And nobody wants to move to Poland or Belarus since they‚Äôre Slavic, and Hungary (a mysterious and alien tribe themselves) probably wouldn‚Äôt want us.
My strategy for Denmark is to hide in the ditch while you guys fight the race war. Once you‚Äôve won, you‚Äôll come and save us before Denmark goes minority Danish.
Good luck, guys. My thoughts and prayers are with you.

            I cannot imagine the anti-white elite allowing that outcome. They will place a very low cap on the number of white babies that can be born, and mandate a higher percentage of li‚Äôl nuggras. Diversity, wot.

                I don‚Äôt think they can stop it. It could be done in any bio lab and the Chinese will go all in on this, they have no moral hang-ups about eugenics and don‚Äôt even care to pretend that lighter skin isn‚Äôt a critical quality in a baby.
Once they start squeezing out little Margo Robbies and Ryan Goslings, the whole world will be clamoring for white babies.

Yes. They breed race horses, they understand the importance of pedigree.

                    Yes, I‚Äôll second that. Reading only American regime media and listening to what American shitlibs think the world seems a darkening place (in all senses of the word). The rest of the world though, increasingly doesn‚Äôt care. Indians, for instance, will tell you that you can pry their skin whiteners from their cold dead hands. It‚Äôs not that China, India, Russia, or any other place is to be emulated in all things but that the culture is all those places is moving *away* from American wokism. It‚Äôs also important to note that the woke ‚Äúculture‚Äù is 100% wedded to the American Empire and the dollar-centric world. The Empire is failing and the world is deliberately moving off the dollar. What will come after that will not be monolithic but will also definitely NOT be American rainbow-fascism which is a unique product of our Judeo-Puritan elite with little appeal outside it.For Americans, the best hope for the future is to look at what the best ideas from the rest of the world are and do what you can to implement them here, biding time for when even the grillers realize it‚Äôs time for something REALLY different.

        ‚ÄúWill high IQ, homogeneous New Hampshire want to be in the same country as diverse and stupid New Mexico?‚ÄùWhat happens is inevitable and we have a (reverse) example right now‚ÄîCA.  High IQ folk (relative) are moving out of CA.  Low IQ folk moving in.  CA is in decline.  Similarly, NH, by remaining high IQ, will cause it to avoid more economic decline than the rest of the States and as such will attract low IQ parasites from other States, and the Constitution and SCOTUS currently support this movement.As the country of the United States attracts low IQ parasites from the world, so too will the remaining successful States attract parasites from other failed States.  There is no escape.We actually saw this in the early 60‚Äôs after the civil rights act in New York.  There was a movement of Southern welfare recipients to high welfare payment NYC.  Poor Blacks with no employment came up from Southern States and went right to the welfare office in NYC and applied for welfare.  Courts in the end supported this.

        Speaking of elevator controls, modern day elevators are now mostly MRL‚Äôs (machine room less elevator) to be able to rent out every inch of available space in a building the mechanicalmachine driving the cab is now mounted on top of the rails in the actual shaft, the electrical control is usually in a small closet located somewhere in the building. Usually not near the cab itself. Cables are a thing of the past, now carbon fiber belts are used. All this results in elevators with a 5 to 10 year opalescence. The elevator business has always been one of the last hold outs when it comes to the trades, now that most of the connections are serial linked and lots of the elevators you will ride today are approved using a variance loophole, it‚Äôs pretty much over for  the specialized requirements needed to break into it and stay without killing yourself or your apprentice. Race to the bottom. Just like every thing else.

        How many years have Republican voters in other states been mocking California.  At the heart of this mockery is ‚Äúthey‚Äôll have to learn their lesson, liberalism doesn‚Äôt work.‚Äù  The operative word is ‚Äúlearn.‚Äù  This implies the cognitive ability to put emotion aside and analyze past failure.  This is what‚Äôs frustrating with the mainstream right.  When I explain to them, no, in fact they‚Äôll keep doing what they‚Äôre doing and its going to get worse and worse, they just shake their heads.  In disbelief?  I don‚Äôt know.  They don‚Äôt say much after that.And by the way, Texas not has an outright majority of thick headed brown peasants.  I will get some satisfaction watching these all hat no cattle Texans watch their new ‚Äúnatural conservatives‚Äù vote in coming elections.

            True. John Cornyn is well to the Right of most Texans. It will remain a soft Republican state a bit longer, ironically, because the open borders pissed off Rio Grande Hispanics, who were largely Democrats, when Haitians, mystery meats and more Indian-blood Mestizos started to show up in the mix. The Biden Administration is ‚Äúprocessing‚Äù aliens abroad in direct response to the brown pushback. Also, the recent California and other refugees are more conservatard than past iterations. Medium-term, though, Texas will become solidly Left.

        Some years back I was stone broke after paying for an uninsured adventure in the cardiac ward. I took the first job I could get- substitute janitor for a local school system. I had done this work full time in my youth, and actually enjoyed it. I was on the sub list for over four years while they hired and fired no fewer than five diversity. I finally got a permanent night spot, but they hired a fat little lesbian for the lead position at the school. She didn‚Äôt have the strength to do much of the work, like for example, setting up risers for assemblies. She asked me to do it. I said, ‚ÄúIf I get time‚Äù, and went about my business. She got the grounds guy to do it for her.She also decided to store a five gallon can of gasoline in the water heater closet. I  corrected that little mistake, and  discussed the matter with the director of maintenance. The school didn‚Äôt burn down, so it wasn‚Äôt worth further discussion.

            One summer I needed a job while going to school.  I applied everywhere and finally wound up at a large food production plant.  I usually asked to see the general manager and bypass HR.  The GM said they‚Äôd filled all the extra help summer slots.He also explained these folk were ‚Äúinner city‚Äù youths the company ‚Äúagreed‚Äù to take on with the mayor‚Äôs office.  He looked at me and said, ‚ÄòShow up tomorrow at the dock early and ask for the production manager.  Odds are these new hires will not show.  Be prepared to start work‚Äô.Yep, he was right.  One of three showed up.  I was put to work immediately as they were short of help for the production run scheduled.  The remaining inner city youth did not last a week and then disappeared.

                That also works at Uni when you‚Äôre trying to get into a required class that has limited available spaces. On day 1go sit in the front row and when the prof does attendance andcertain people don‚Äôt show, then you‚Äôre in.

        ‚ÄúThere is no reason to think that the company providing safety services to airports is less concerned for their diversity goals than the company making cheap beer.‚ÄùI believe this to be an absolute truth, Z Man.Go onto the main website of any corporation ‚Äì say, an Amazon or Oracle: you‚Äôll see various images of a melting pot of people along with messages about saving the planet and diversity being ‚Äúwho we are‚Äù. Now, I‚Äô expect that from corporations so large they need to get into bed with the regime, as they‚Äôre very useful to the regime. But now look at large companies, medium companies and even small companies with only 50-100 employees ‚Äì look attheirwebsites: same Message!The way that ‚ÄúThe Message‚Äù has percolated down from higher echelons to the pretty low echelons is startling. It really is. I‚Äôm seeing it everywhere around me and it is one of the main reasons for either becoming a contractor, starting a very small company (or joining one).My current company was around 40 people in strength and did things their own way. They were bought, around four years ago, by a much larger company in the same field, an Lo! The changes soon began. The operation seemed to go as follows: First, the parent company sends in some higher-up soothsayers. They tell us that even though we‚Äôve been acquired, nothing will change. The culture will be the same! Second, a steadily increasing number of intrusive initiatives are ramped up (email domain name changes, different HR software, merging of functionally related groups across the business) that spread the parent‚Äôs ‚Äúculture‚Äù. Third, and grandest of all, aforementioned higher-ups dismiss any concerns and insist the child company will still have it‚Äôs own culture.In my assimilated company, the latest HR software tool asks us for our pronouns. It has a Twatter like ‚Äúfeed‚Äù so that the latest HR graduate can inform us of how the parent company intends to celebrate ‚ÄúPride‚Äù. It is the devil‚Äôs work, no doubt about it. And to get back to your statement, one reason I am so confident in the fact that the decline will only get worse, is that I am damn sureevery company of consequenceis kissing the DIE arse.Now, one might wonder how small to medium companies can survive under all this? Maybe they‚Äôll be killed off? Maybe that‚Äôs ‚Äúthe Plan‚Äù. Who knows? Have Faith, pray and each day ask ‚Äúwhat can I do within my immediate circle to improve matters.‚Äù We must have a positive motivation, despite facing Evil daily and having it ride roughshod over us.

        A couple of related notes today.The New Founding folks are a spin off of Claremont. They are building a parallel economy and it seems highly focused on Christianity. In recent days they have greatly increased the mailings with options and suggestions for their parallel social-economic arrangement. I clicked around their dating, children‚Äôs books, cub-scouts alternative ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ I wanted to see what the advertisements and illustrations looked like. They looked like Anti-White corporatism. Black man helping a white boy saw. Children‚Äôs books with more black monks than white monks with a chinese monk sprinkled in.It‚Äôs funny, I never cared about race. However, after turning the Martin/Brown/Floyd into martyrs to be used as a weapon to begin an officially anti-white state and seeing the black out in ads, tv and white erasure in our history I am sick to my stomach of this imagery. These so-called conservatives and christians are as diversity happy as the left. To conserve is to preserve. To preserve the truth and your history you depict things as they really were. That is not what they are doing.I am building a list of businesses, education options ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ of, for and by our folk. We need to build our own e-zines, lists and sites. More is emerging but we need some over-arching coordination. This isn‚Äôt the place for that discussion, but curious if some have links where this can or is being done. We have a lot to offer and we will appeal to more people by completely rejecting, ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù, in our imagery and advertising ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Kirk Sorensen and the scientific community working on Thorium and LMS reactors are going to be very important to our future, as is 3D printing and additive manufacturing. They will be critical technologies to ensure our regions, which I pray we develop to ensure our survival and ability to flourish, are sovereign and powerful.

                The US Navy could tell us about safe, compact nuclear power on submarines.
The place to look, though, is the submariners.  White guys who trained on the sub systems, with an eye towards working in the industry.
They apply, but aren‚Äôt hired; there is a good source of practical dissident knowledge.

You read my mind.
The failure to levarge the institutional knowledge of the US Navy‚Äôs nuclear mariners and submariners is likely the greatest, most tragic waste of human and intellectual capital that absolutely no one is discussing at any level.

        While my main concern is with the US due to concern for my children‚Äôs future, I believe from a moral standpoint we need more, not less, incompetency in the US.The world is safer now that the US military can‚Äôt win wars. The fact that our intelligence agencies are headed by people who live in an information bubble keeps the world safer. We aren‚Äôt even as good at color revolutions.White countries and a former white led country like South Africa show that there are plenty of white men who will gladly take jobs to oppress other whites. I hope that the DOJ, FBI and all other anti white hate agencies really do fight white privilege by not hiring white men. The FBI should only be staffed by men in dresses, strong independent woman and Chinese spies.. American whites will be much safer for it.The fact that the tribal members and white women leading foreign policy can‚Äôt see that Russian sanctions and the anal revolution don‚Äôt make people want to flock to the American Empire is speeding the creation of a multi polar world. Ultimately the demise of the American Empire will be beneficial for Americans.

            My comment:  Spot on.  As Z correctly notes, there is no fixing anything any more ‚Äì ‚ÄúWe have passed the point of no return.‚Äù  If you have the sanity and intellect to face this reality with one institution ‚Äì voting for an obvious example ‚Äì then you must logically recognize the same reality in every other institution.  The FAA?  Gone.  The FBI?  Gone.  The public education system?  Gone.  The medical system?  Gone.  The various iterations of the modern American church?  Gone.Given the complex and interdependent characteristics of modern society, no one thing can be ‚Äòfixed‚Äô without addressing and changing multiple other inputs and outputs.  Who/what is to blame?  From scanning online comments about the fully-expected flight chaos around AINO‚Äôs evil rayciss birfday, only a handful of people see even a piece of the problem.  Is it incompetent scheduling?  Overbooking?  Diverse FAA hires?  Lack of healthy, non-vaxed White pilots?  Extrapolate from there and examine any aspect of modern culture, institutions, and government.If you are truly a dissident, and not merely a conservacuck, you thus understand that there is no ‚Äòfix‚Äô by putting the ‚Äòright people‚Äô in charge, or returning to the ‚Äòfounding‚Äô magic papers.   Human nature is fundamentally flawed, and thus any human built or run system is as well.  This can be mitigated by the smart fraction, morality, control of women and non-Whites, etc. ‚Äì and each of these has been frayed to the breaking point.Thus yes ‚Äì I am an ‚Äòaccelerationist.‚Äô  I don‚Äôt want the gubmint of the perverse to work efficiently or well or at all.  I don‚Äôt want the military to be capable White men.  I don‚Äôt want anything to be functional or capable because it will be directed against me and mine.  The enlightenment notion that we are all atomistic individuals utterly ignores the reality of familial and social bonds, of culture and society.  And because all of that is now poisonous and irreparable, I believe the only way forward is to separate oneself and one‚Äôs family from it.Obviously there is homeschooling, and using traditional older texts . . . but to what end?  Homeschoolers often boast of their children getting admitted to ‚Äòprestigious‚Äô colleges.  Own goal.  Traditional families?  Great . . . but your little princess loves gymnastics, and needs the best education.  Own goal.  Learn a trade that cannot be exported and will always be in demand?  Terrific.  But then spend all your time enabling the magic paper/magic dirt assorted riffraff having functional plumbing and electrical service ‚Äì that you then pay for.  Own goal.What to do?  Truly and functionally separate.  Call it the dissident ‚ÄòBenedict option,‚Äô in ironic homage to one of the most mentally disturbed conservacucks out there.  Accept in your gut what it truly means that There is NO fixing This.  Figure out what it will take for you to survive long term ‚Äì either living by lies and endless comprises and eventual assimilation of your grandchildren into the borg, or become genuinely intellectually and spiritually and corporeally separate.It truly is past time to choose your future path.  Many already have ‚Äì because you want your kids to ‚Äòsucceed‚Äô by today‚Äôs metrics, or because now your own grandchildren would  report you as a rayciss.  Or because your spouse needs social acceptance and believes ‚Äòthe science.‚Äô  We all have our weaknesses and compromises.  But what do they lead to?  When does it stop?  Choose your own ‚Äòline in the sand.‚Äô  In far too many cases it‚Äôs already been chosen by your own choices and values.Choose wisely.

                The upside to being an accelerationist is that you don‚Äôt have to do anything overt other than control the personal in the ways you listed. Things are accelerating on their own now. While I know some psychopaths would send F16‚Äôs to level every home 15 miles outside of a city‚Äìlet Gaia sort them out, they will think‚Äìthe smart money still is moving as far away as possible. In the near future, bar those F-16‚Äôs and competent pilots‚Äìthe Regime is going to have a very difficult time exerting its will further and further from the imperial capitol. We saw glimpses of this with Covid. Short term it arguably may be safer in the Blue places due to those F-16s, but the loss of competence is making that a brief reality and unsafe bet.

                Now that nearly every institution is converged and working against the interests of normal people, I want to see more incompetency.I have lived for years in developing countries and you can quickly see that the effectiveness and diligence of whites has been used against us.Case in point the Covid hysteria. The police in overly corrupt countries were not as diligent about inforcing the insanity as were police in first world countries. Why should they have been? No money in it for them. In the US the police get great pensions so they are easy to control.Only exceptions I can think of are pilots, doctors, lawyers and judges. I would have rather been Kyle Rittenhouse than James Fields.However, overall we are safer with more incompetency.

The downside, of course, is these buffoons control nukes and given the current situation are fully capable of doing something stupid and igniting a nuclear holocaust.

        Sounds like a bunch of whining to me. If we ‚Äî whoever we are ‚Äî aren‚Äôt competent enough to stem the rising tide of alleged stupidity, who are the stupid ones? Been to New Hampshire lately?
The rogues and scoundrels that comprise our ruling elite haven‚Äôt sparked an effective opposition and who‚Äôs to blame but the would be opposition? If I were one of the elite, competence in the manufacture and installation of luxury jet liner systems, agreed. And tech wizardry.

If your survival instinct is still intact, then you‚Äôve got to try to solve the problems of affluence and pathological compassion that afflict our people.
And you can‚Äôt just try to save yourself, because an individual man without the protection of a tribe will be picked off by another hostile tribe.

            The fundamental flaw of every Civilization is that it tames Nature and therefore in the process also tames that part of Nature which eliminates the stupid. The stupid overwhelm Civilization and then Nature comes in and wipes out the entire shindig.The fear of Nature as seen by the Covid panic is a clear sign that the masses today would die out rapidly without the ill-conceived protections Civilization provides.In the history of Nature vs Civilization, Nature has never lost the fight in the long run as Spengler‚Äôs study of Civilizations showed.Natural law stands undefeated against human law.Turns out intelligence (high IQ) is simply a different word for retardedness. Intelligent enough to create a Civilization, too retarded to see the consequences centuries down the line. It may not be a coincidence that so many children are now born being on the spectrum. The final form of the Civilizational Man, the true form is the Retard, overwhelmed by the masses of Stupid Men his own retardness produced.

                Mostly agree, but I‚Äôd rephrase: ‚ÄúCivilization ATTEMPTS to tame Nature.‚Äù Someone said, correctly I believe, that civilization is a rebellion against Nature. Note that statement makes no claim about whether such a revolt will or will not succeed! And just so: Civilization living by Nietzsche‚Äôs ‚ÄúSlave Morality‚Äù ‚Äî such as the present era ‚Äî does indeed seem to strengthen the weak, to protect the stupid from their folly, and so on.

        The future is now in various places and, sadly, there‚Äôs very few signs of whites doing much of anything as the low-IQ surround them.Look at California and New Mexico. Whites are a minority and, yet, the states continue to (sort of) function. Also, the whites there either move out or live in their own neighborhoods.Brazil is also a possible future. Enclaves surrounded by poverty. However, my understanding is that in Brazil, the upper class, which is basically white, does stick together and views themselves as a separate people.Finally, there‚Äôs South Africa. Even there most whites just lay back and watch the country fall apart. A few whites seem to be getting the message, but look at what it took to get them to that point and think how far whites in the USA are from that point.Regionalization would seem to be best path for America, but these examples don‚Äôt offer a lot of hope. But, yes, eventually, some whites will push back or break away. It‚Äôs just a question of how long and how much we lose before that happens.

            People are sorting and there is a de facto dissolution happening now. I don‚Äôt know how it will shake out, but white separation is sort of well underway. It may turn out to be a stopgap measure as the suburbs proved to be, but it is hard to envision an effective central government at this point able to counter the move. It would take something seriously egregious to prompt any de facto action as long as the economy remains tolerable, of course.

                Sorting will continue but will accelerate, and those who can‚Äôt afford to live in ‚Äúgood schools‚Äù areas will be stuck in diversitopias.  Expect an increasing widening in the price of housing in the White areas compared to housing in diverse areas, which will plummet.
Because of that, I would expect the effort to import diversity and government subsidized housing into White areas to greatly increase.  That‚Äôs when the ‚ÄúI got mine‚Äù crowd will push back.

        I keep hearing echoes of the 2006 film, ‚ÄúIdiocracy‚Äù, throughout your essay. And Kornbluth‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Marching Morons.‚Äù The problem is that we cannot talk about the hereditary basis or the ethnic basis of intelligence any more. We cannot talk of eugenics either. But of course in our day-to-day decisions we constantly factor ethnicity in. I want my doctor to be white. I want my car mechanic to be an old white man. I want my lawyer (and probably my accountant as well) to be a Jew. I can‚Äôt help noticing that cities like Minneapolis (and half a century earlier, Detroit) circle the drain when a tipping point is reached a propos the percentage of blacks residing there. I notice that the area of the USA with the highest percentage of whites is New England and is the least dysfunctional.

            All good points. Ostei asked the other day if there ever had been a program the Left abandoned and I responded with several, eugenics chief among them (the lobotomy aspect lingered well into the 80‚Äôs in progressive Oregon and Washington; ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO‚ÄôS NEST was Forman‚Äôs attempt to stop the practice and that was twenty years before it ended). I agree with the Left on many of eugenics points, too.I would submit that much of the Climate Change madness is a disguised attempt at eugenics. The apparent goal is anti-Whiteness, but if implemented the primary population elimination would be of POC throughout the Third World. While that is laudable in many ways, the Green programs still are problematic in that they also hurt our people and empower our enemies.It is for this reason, by the way, that I rued the day DOBBS came down. That was very helpful for our people.

I‚Äôm sure elimination of the competition is the first objective‚Äìthat‚Äôs the motive behind the Great Replacement, after all, but the practical reality is those are the groups can figure out survival. It is like the argument that chimpouts can be avoided over food inflation by increasing food stamps, which overlooks that still requires the presence of food.
I agree with you on networking, to be clear, but the main goal is population elimination and that will be achieved albeit not in the intended ways.

            I think that one needs to qualify your statement concerning the residual competence of New England. Look at the huge number of shitlibs there; with this, how long can they resist the wonders of ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù? As an example, look to the influx of Somalis ‚Äì of all degraded and degrading populations ‚Äì  in Maine, ffs.

                The thing is, they do resist the wonders of diversity. Spend time in New England and you will see that the true believers live in the whitest neighborhoods. Their ability to live one way and talk another is remarkable. It is not just with regards to race either. Bourgeoise liberalism selects for people who are high in belief and very low in self-awareness.

        The other question is whether the elite and managerial classes can distance themselves from the disfunction by creating their own more competent enclaves? If they can then the general incompetency can last quite awhile before collapse.A good example might be banana island in Lagos Nigeria. The island is a man made modern world that the masses do not get access to unless by permission. This type of isolation won‚Äôt be a problem for the wealthy but they will also need enough of the managerial class to have their own pockets.The planes of commercial carriers such as American Airlines might start dropping from the skies but probably not in a significant number. There are plenty of messed up countries with their own airlines. After all the elite do not fly commercial. They fly in private jets with pilots who aren‚Äôt vaccinated and have their own mechanics. They also have their own lawyers, doctors, financial advisors and security.And I want to keep stressing that if you are from Mexico or Somalia in our lifetime your are not likely to want to return because of rising incompetency in the US. Most people will be conformable with general incompetency.If AI does really live up to its hype then that will also help forestal the full impact of incompetency.That said, the sub fiasco is an excellent case study of why the elite don‚Äôt actually live by their equity rules. The CEO drank the kool-aid. Most don‚Äôt

            Just some weird data points:For the most part, US airlines can‚Äôt currently bring a bunch of H1B visa eligible pilots in from other countries.  There‚Äôs only one extremely narrow visa available for Australian pilots (E3B).(Oddly enough, for India and Mexico have the highest rates of female pilots for commercial flying)Look at any major airline corporate webpage/advertising and it looks like there are no heterosexual white men left at the company or in the passenger/customer base (except the CEO, White Man‚Äôs Burden and all).Look at the actual flight line, and the racial demographics look like the graduating class of Harvard in 1920.

                Positions where there is a big downside fur the business if anything screws up tend to still be open to white men. But even there pressure is to hire everyone else and be diverse.
The last group of pilots to start favoring non white men will be for private jets. Given the powerful want unvalidated pilots after mandating the death jab to commercial pilots suggests they may never turn against white men.

            TomC,You‚Äôre absolutely right. Civilization is fundamentally an Ice Structure built by Ice People. The invading hordes tend to be Desert People.There are only two ways this ends:1. Desert melts Ice and Ice in turn floods Desert (the Apocalypse)2. Ice People return to the North. In Flanders and Holland, there is a show called ‚ÄúHet Hooge Noorden‚Äù, which is Dutch for The High North. The Germanics are getting fed up with their desert Maghreb invaders ‚Äì so in this widely popular show they‚Äôre moving up to icy NorwayThe first way is the suicide approach inherent in Western Civilization today, but also in former Ice Structures (Civilizations) ‚Äì e.g. in Vedic Civilization, Buddhism was the suicide approach.The second way is the only way the Civilization Types, the Ice Men and Women, survive the onslaught of the Desert.

                An attractive construct. However, civilization formed in the Near East and the eastern Mediterranean. Desert lands, alas. Nary a fjord nor an Alp in sight. And it was largely Ice People‚ÄìGermanics‚Äìwho laid civilization low for half a millennium.

                    Perhaps. I‚Äôm not 100% sure myself, though simply because the Near East and eastern Mediterranean are desert lands, doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean those civilizations weren‚Äôt ice structures.
It‚Äôs possible Ice People emigrated all the way there. There‚Äôs apparently some DNA evidence that e.g. the Egyptians pharaohs were of ‚ÄúEuropean‚Äù descent.
Local climates change as well.
Either way, when I look at the Civilizations I have a good understanding of, they‚Äôre all Ice Structures. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a coincidence.

        A lot of people are going to be sacrificed first, but a new social stratification will emerge. We are seeing the very beginning of it in South Africa where whites are coming under increasing threat from blacks. A small town had been quietly established that is white only, no blacks allowed. They are armed to the teeth, and the ‚Äúshoot, shovel and shut up‚Äù law system is strictly enforced. Black gangs have tried to raid the community and they just disappear. The whites say nothing. When the black president threatens to cut off whitey‚Äôs power and water (the competence crisis is deepening in South Africa right on schedule)‚Ä¶the people in the white township shrug and take care of it themselves. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they aren‚Äôt making their own arms and ammunition too.We‚Äôve seen much the same thing play out with our friends with the big noses and small hats in the Middle East. Much as I despise those people‚Ä¶ they make no bones about kicking the Palestinians out, cleaning up the mess they‚Äôve made, and turning former deserts into productive farm land. They tolerate the proximity of Palestinians and treat them fairly well if they submit and behave‚Ä¶ but they‚Äôre absolutely ruthless with them if they do not. Like the emerging white community in South Africa‚Ä¶Isreal can survive literally surrounded by hostile, low trust/low IQ enemies. The smart people clan up and work together. The dumb ones clan up but don‚Äôt work well together. So it will go for us. After the balkanization of North America, white settlements will arise and thrive and if ethnics get in the way, the whites will shoot, shovel, and shut up just as the Israelis do.Race realities are going to reassert themselves and it will hurt some white populations more than others. So it goes as with any other liberal social experiment‚Ä¶they only end one way.

            The State is going to increasingly work to destroy their enemies in red areas through ‚Äúlow income housing‚Äù and ‚Äúrefugee resettlement‚Äù, basically biowarfare. It worked in the 1960‚Äôs to get rid of those pesky ethnic neighborhoods in the city and they‚Äôll do it again.This is still easy to do because the power of D.C.can crush any isolated rebellion, but once a thousand de-facto Oranias pop up all over the country and the attitude of the average American changes away from ‚ÄúI need to move to a ‚Äòbetter school district&#x27;‚Äù every time a town gets wrecked, the price of such heavy-handed measures become untenable.

                Nonsense, Chet. The puck is still very much in play, and there is still lots of time on the clock ‚Äì years, perhaps a decade.Our fate is far from sealed. We are already seeing the first tremors before the massive tectonic shift. The usual suspects are wailing and sobbing that Germany and Greece have elected ‚Äúfar right‚Äù gubbimints. Sweden just announced they will no longer be part of the mass immigration project. Seems their shitty liberal white women are getting fed up with being raped. Not two years ago, this would have been unthinkable. Add in that they are devolving into Weimar Europe. Germany is now basically de-industrialized and poised for a full depression. Fwance and Britain are almost certainly going to follow suit. With all this as background‚Ä¶ the Euros are coming face to face with a full blown crisis of competence AND credibility. They are being told their misery is all worth it because it‚Äôs a necessary sacrifice to Gaia The Earth Mother, and Putler has to be stopped and regime-changed. I can tell you with near certainty that ‚Äì somewhere ‚Äì Hitler‚Äôs revenge and rebirth is kicking into high gear. The jews are chitting bricks and they are square. The Restoration is going to be LIT. I think the Dissidents are too black pilled sometimes. Deporting these animals is not going to be all that difficult. If you can get billions of dollars of welfare out to illegals with the precision of a Swiss watch ‚Äì deporting them will be child‚Äôs play.Whitey just needs the motivation to do what must be done. And as usual‚Ä¶ Darwin and Murphy and perhaps God are standing by to see that he gets it.

                Chet:  I saw this story yesterday somewhere or other.  Just checked Yandex for specifics and Lo and Behold!The Biden administration is planning to use a former North Carolina boarding school campus to house hundreds of migrant children, according to CBS News.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services‚Äô (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement will open the doors of what used to be the American Hebrew Academy in Greensboro, North Carolina, to house up to 800 migrant children between the ages of 13 and 17 who crossed the southern border illegally, according to CBS News, citing a U.S. official familiar with the plan. The facility is intended to serve as ‚Äúinflux care‚Äù to provide emergency housing,Every.  Single.  Time.

        Canada recently went all in regarding immigration, wanting to fill an enormous amount of skilled positions. Let‚Äôs forget the country is already so expensive as to practically be unlivable, and the surety of low-IQ cheaters getting in, and ask whether this will help the country is we assume the average immigrant is 110 IQ for argument‚Äôs sake.Given these people are coming from all over the world, all with their own ethnic solidarity, customs, along with zero skin-in-the-game with the nation as a whole. How productive are a group of marginally above-average intelligence people in working together? Is there going to be a wave of innovation, or a bunch of disinterested drones who do as little as they can get away with, while the rest to  politicking to try to get into a higher position for their peer groups?The Manhattan project would not have worked with modern diverse hiring, even if the IQs of the researchers were the same. The X factor of group cohesion is utterly missing, and that‚Äôs probably a lot of the reason our current space program can‚Äôt reproduce what was done in the 60‚Äôs.Homogeneity is an IQ multiplier, allowing groups to work together in cohesive ways that punch way above their weight. Add that to Westerner‚Äôs historian faustian urge to push the boundaries that is vacant from other civilizations, and we see the reason for technological ascendance. Long term, these immigration policies won‚Äôt be so much an economic boon as a world-scale IQ shredder.

            Canada has an explicit plan to increase its population from 38 million today to 100 million by 2100.‚Äô22 was a massive hockey stick spike in immigration that will now flatten until their models tell them reproduction will get them to 100M by 2100. The only thing that will stop it are things we can‚Äôt discuss here.Red state Republicans are implementing the southern portion of Patraeus and his financier‚Äôs plan to destroy America. Idaho, North Dakota, Oklahoma and others are agitating for increased immigration, and they setting up the interior transportation and registration station for a non-American population to be shipped around to work. It is taking on the character of Hunger Games.My personal take is that the Competency Crisis will be most severe not in technical expertise, but in the social and legal structures. European man didn‚Äôt just develop technology with our IQ, we built the sophisticated legal and social structures from our bio-culture.Of course, if my bio-culture thesis is wrong and anyone can create those structures, the multi-culturists have torn apart the fabric of society to begin their project. If they brought in the diversity and made it crystal clear that this was America and they were to be Americans maybe someday, then at least they would assimilate. Instead, they came in told them to hate the country, its founding stock and preserve their loyalty to their tribe.The project is doomed from the beginning. Right now, they blame whitey and men, but the lesson they have taught is that racial strife is a feature of the system. Most people follow and imitate, and what this ruling class has done is given them an abomination to mimic.

                Idaho State Senate calls for more immigration to provide more workers.
https://idahonews.com/news/local/memorial-calling-on-federal-government-to-address-immigration-reform-passes-senate
The Republicans here think that it is still 1985 and what this country needs is more Reagan, especially the amnesty and the lack of concern about border control.
When I try to warn them about the dangers of immigration, they laugh and say that the problem is that the other states weren‚Äôt welcoming enough.  We‚Äôll show them what real hospitality is and everything will work out great.
These people are offering their exposed throat and asking to be slaughtered.  It‚Äôs sad, because they are otherwise such great people.

                    Yeah, yeah, yeah.Sober up you lot! You shame your ancestors! They did not raise you to be fools!Canada is ready to start hanging liberals out West. Turdo La Do can barely show his face out here for fear of getting shot. He‚Äôs often absent from parliament because he gets savagely mauled by the conservatives. The immigration thing is going to come to a head soon. In Ireland, when buses show up to discharge their loads of human trash in small Irish communities, they are met with locals wielding baseball bats. JewToob shows any number of their women trying to escape foreign rapists, and the locals tuning them up with shileighlies and billy clubs. Some fag small town mayor in Fwance had his house burned down because he wanted to bring in busloads of third world scum over the objections of his electorate. Sweden just announced an end to its mass immigration program because the shitty white liberal women there are getting raped at insane rates. The demographic peril is clear‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt be surprised if the first mass deportations start within the next five years.Our doom is only assured if you sit on your hands and do nothing. Right now that is an option but it is rapidly closing off. Have faith in yourselves. You got this. Rough times are ahead for us but we will prevail.

        Great analysis. Reminds me of Pat Buchanan‚Äôs line. ‚ÄúSorry, but that cat cannot be walked back.‚ÄùI scheduled a medical appointment for my son and I was telling him of a connection we have with the doctor‚Äôs family. My son told me that the connection doesn‚Äôt matter, all that matters is that the dr be a white guy.The constitution of this GAE seems to be the ‚ÄúI have a dream‚Äù speech and the reckless stupidity of those devout believers and tptb should be a stark warning of the gradual, impending collapse.

                Jeffrey Zoar:  Why my husband and I stopped flying.  The vax, DIE pilots, DIE FAA, DIE passengers.  Just not worth it to us.

                Same here. Some of that has to do w/ the hiring/retiring requirements that they‚Äôve imposed on ATCs. They need some one to stare at a screen (not that one) and integrate data as it comes in.  Not sure the ‚Äúalways online‚Äù have the skills? Maybe this is one area where AI can contribute?

        There is also the issue of plunging birth rates.  This is particularly true of New England states with higher average IQs.  Who takes over Vermont when the current residents of the state fail to reproduce?Another question is what happens to life expectancy as the competency crisis sweeps through the medical field. Last fall I needed to see a doctor for a persistent sinus infection.  The obese doctor I got into walked into my appointment wearing two masks and a face shield.  I wouldn‚Äôt have trusted him with anything important, let alone a serious health issue.  The medical community and the media treated an industry leader admitting on video that part of the reason they pushing the trans mania on kids is because it created an income stream for them with a yawn.

            I don‚Äôt see Korean restaurants hiring fat black trannies as servers, don‚Äôt see black bbq joints rushing to hire american indians and I don‚Äôt see dot indian businesses hiring marias as IT back office. As far as whites, the ones I know are sitting on their hands waiting for the collapse, when their competence will (possibly) result in low IQ howlers wanting them back. Right now any competent white person with mechanical skills is booked 2 years out or more and can name their own price.

            It‚Äôs all birth rate driven.  Anywhere there is prosperity and women are given the option to delay/never have children, they vastly prefer to have few or no children.Dutton talks about this a great deal.  No country knows how to fix it.  Financial incentives don‚Äôt work, free day care seems to make it even worse.  Immigrants adopt low fertility rates in one generation. Religion seems to be the only bulwark (Amish, Mormons), but even there the trend is going the wrong way.In the West, this is 100% women driven.  There‚Äôs a weird intersection here where most would agree that no woman should be forced to have children; alternatively, if the women of one generation decided collectively to never have kids, the society would be on the verge of extinction in 50 years.I‚Äôve no solutions.

            I recently had nearly as bad an experience with my lung doctor. He (probably) hails from the Indian subcontinent. I have no reason to doubt his intelligence, but his competence, not so sure. I‚Äôd discontinued a medication without his approval. He gave me a sanctimonious line about how patients refuse doctors‚Äô advice until they are in the emergency room. I retorted ‚ÄúDoctor, how many people end up in the ER for allergic rhinitis (hay fever)?‚Äù On this and a previous visit I mentioned how I‚Äôd lost much of my trust in medicine. He asked for an example. I cited the Covid-19 vaccines. He defended them, claiming they‚Äôd saved ‚Äúbillions‚Äù (yes, that‚Äôs with a ‚ÄúB‚Äù) of lives. That‚Äôs a major factual error right there, but I didn‚Äôt press the issue. There had already been enough acrimony for one visit üôÇ At one point, I actually was ready to walk out of the room. The only reason I‚Äôll stick with him ‚Äî for now at least ‚Äî is that he monitors a lung nodule I have.Unintentionally,  he made a valid point during that visit, however: If his attitude and apaprent lack of actual knowledge are any indication, perhaps it‚Äôs actually in the patient‚Äôs best interest to avoid the medical system until there‚Äôs no other choice. This is a shame, of course because at least in theory, they really can cure or at least manage many conditions. As with much of our civiization, it does seem that medicine is decaying. Are we fated to return to leeches and bleeding and consulting the woman who deals in herbs?

                    They can be sued, but the evidence of bias will be less apparent (wrong word perhaps) without hard numbers to compare as produced by the LSAT, MCAT, SAT, GRE, or ACT.  I‚Äôm certain however that as objective measures are dropped, clever people will figure out challenges to the new devious acceptance processes.

        ‚ÄúWhat sort of society is possible with the demographics of the future?‚Äù
from what i see in south africa my assumption is whites will band together in small pockets.
Not as many africans in USA as they are in SA though, meaning it won‚Äôt get as bad. No muslims, latinos are the most docile brown people out there, so I don‚Äôt think it will be that bad.
I‚Äôd say white majority states(regions) will separate and recreate mini-versions of white America, rest goes to shit, kind of like USSR. Russia is great, rest not so much.

                Completely agree with you.He is a fraud and grifter, going after the Normies or even ‚Äúour side‚Äù (those wirh DR tendencies) for money and fame.I found him amusing but didn‚Äôt really follow his work much.And then with that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting arrested by FBI!‚Äù scam, I no longer waste my time.
It‚Äôs SO beyond me why any others waste their time on him, either.Time that is much better spent learning how to plant your on vegetables‚Ä¶!!
