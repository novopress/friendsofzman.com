        Sanders is amusing because no one but the hard core socialists and Commies take him seriously. But at least he is what he says he is, he’s not pretending to be someone or something he isn’t, like the current president, or like Shrillary.

        The number of jobs he would create has varied between 15 and 25 million, but there is a problem. Bernie forgot to factor in the cost of concrete, steel, asphalt, etc. Big WHOOPS.

        Next to Hilldog and Sanders, anyone looks good – even O’malley.  The republican debates look to be interesting and tough.  The democrat debate/s, if they debate at all,  will be real entertainment.  No popcorn here, a rack of ribs and cold beers.

        At least Sanders shines light on the ugly truth – that people with high three digit IQs hijacked the system and created a society where it is impossible to thrive unless you are hyper intelligent. No real marketable skills? Minimum wage and canned beans for you.

        I thought for sure that Jerry Brown would enter the race, but it looks like I was mistaken.

        O’Malley seems to want to be the Vladimir Putin of the Democratic Party with his shirtless poses and all.

        The other thing about Bernie Sanders’ entry is it tactically outflanked Liz Warren, who would have been to the left of Hil, but not as far over as Bernie. Bernie might even get the VP offer from Clinton, to tie down the left wing, and to show that Biden actually wasn’t the worst possible vice president choice.

            Cankles has already let slip that she intends to tab anillegal alienHispanic as her VP. I don’t think she gets the chance. O’Malley will beat her and be the nominee. The Dems don’t like losers and they don’t like old women.
