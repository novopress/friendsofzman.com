        I wish, as an Englishman, to throw my small weight into the Britain or Scotland debate. It is up to the Scots to decide if they wish to be ‘independent’ (though the sensible money is that they will aim for being in the EU as soon as possible, not least because Brussels provides a safe haven for failed or worn out politicians to go on being paid vast salaries) and they will no doubt cast votes inspired by  emotional subjects such as Mel Gibson waving a sword.Most English people are pretty neutral about Scotland. England gets lot of them heading south to get jobs (and some, like the strange Gordon Brown, end up with jobs they aren’t able to do) and a lot of English money goes to Scotland. The Scots say they want to keep the Pound but the Bank of England says not so fast, Jock; you can’t hold on to a currency which is divorced from the process of taxation and inflation and all the whims of modern fiscal policy.The parliament at Westminster has all sorts of allowances for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and allows them to have their own assemblies. Interestingly, there are no special allowances for England and no assembly for the English. The result is that Scots and Welsh can vote on issues that affect the English but the English cannot vote on issues in Scotland or Wales,  etc.You can see why many English have not only little interest in what Scotland does but even think it would be a good idea to get rid of all the Scots from English life.I admit I will miss the blue on the Union Jack, but maybe we can let the Welsh have a bit of green in it.

        Generally, economists are better at solving &amp; explaining acute economic problems than predicting or preventing them. A doctor cannot reliably predict if someone can get cancer or prevent someone from getting cancer, but he can offer treatment for it and an explanation for the biological processes that cause cancer.
