        “Political scientists have a theory called “democratic consolidation,” which holds that once countries develop democratic institutions, a robust civil society and a certain level of wealth, their democracy is secure.”
Dysgenic immigration policies that drive America’s IQ down to an average of 90 couldn’t possible get in the way of our secure democracy.

            I’d really love to see the white papers on that.  Is India, say, a secure democracy? Or is their civil society a little too robust?  What about France, where they change constitutions more often than their underwear (as Jonah Goldberg once put it) and where their robust civil society and ever-changing constitution seems designed to lower their certain level of wealth?  How about Peru? Too democratic, or not democratic enough? I’m betting the whole thing ispetitio principii,as Latin Americans say.

                It’s generally assumed that you need a mean IQ of around 93 to make a modern economy work. That does not mean you end up with liberal democracy. China is never going to be a liberal democracy, but it can have a modern economy. Venezuela, on the other hand, is never going to have a modern economy or a liberal democracy.

                    Honduras and Guatemala flirt with a national IQ in the high 60’s.
We need them, how?

                        In fairness, IQ tests don’t always capture innate ability. If you are bad at reading, dyslexic, get bored with detail, are bad at word problems or not trained to sit still and focus long enough to take a boring test, you may not score high even though you have the raw ability. I am guessing that a good chunk of these low IQ scores can be explained accordingly. Especially when you grow up in chaotic circumstances where education isn’t valued.(For the record, I don’t know what my IQ is but I’ve always done well on standardized tests. I’m not bragging, I just didn’t wanted you to think didn’t think a sore loser typed that.)

                            As far as it goes, that’s true. A few environmental factors appear to have some measurable effect on IQ (iodine deficiency is a big one IIRC, as such factors go). If it’s true and we know it, it’s quantifiable and the size of the effect has been measured.And it has, and you’re off by roughly an order of magnitude.That said, IIRC the lowest average national IQs are around 70ish and are found in sub-Saharan Africa. Top Google results say Guatemala and Honduras are 79 and 81, which sounds in the ballpark for the demographics. Call it +/-5 if you like, I really don’t mind. The 60 guy above is mistaken.

                            IQ tests are crude and imperfect measures of intelligence, but their predictive validity isn’t in dispute. The US military typically doesn’t take recruits with IQs below, I believe, 91, because even infantry Marines are hard to train below that level. Most people who’ve made significant scientific and artistic contributions have IQs at a minimum of around 120. While IQ tests might not capture every aspect of an individual’s intelligence, they tell us a lot about groups.Hispanic-American IQ is about 90 and there’s no reason to be optimistic about them closing the gap with whites educationally or economically. There have been persistent gaps for over 100 years between Mexican and European immigrants.

                                Show me the IQ of the average Eastern European immigrant from 1920.  How is it that those low IQ peasants were able to spawn doctors, lawyers and other productive members of society. I’m sure my grandfather, with his third grade Euro peasant education in the 1920’s, would score pretty low on those IQ tests, but he was no dummy.Testing for IQ isn’t like testing blood when you are testing people from outside the traditional person who would be taking those tests because test-taking involves a certain amount of skill and comfort level in the art of test-taking itself.I have never studied for a standardized tests before 1987. In fact, I didn’t think you were even supposed to. Almost 30 years ago, I took the GMAT. I walked into the test and winged it. I scored in the 40 percentile range. I knew I was better than that, so I bought a practice book and went through the problems a few times. I walked into the test a second time and scored in the off the charts.  What does that tell you? Test taking skills and techniques are just as important if you are trying to measure somebody’s innate ability.

                                    TempoNick, there are a few common arguments that people use to try to discredit the idea of IQ testing altogether. One of them is the low-IQs of Jews who were tested in Ellis Island, I believe, in the 20s. In the book ‘Intelligence, Race, And Genetics: Conversations With Arthur R. Jensen,’ Jensen explained that this was the result of psychologists choosing to test the IQs of immigrants who they suspected of having low-IQs. Did the same thing happen with Eastern European immigrants in the 20s? I’m not sure. I’m not an expert on this stuff.Are you aware that racial differences in brain size exist? If you don’t think differences in brain size matter, this neuroscientist at Stanford disagrees:https://neuroscience.stanford.edu/news/ask-neuroscientist-does-bigger-brain-make-you-smarterI’m not sure where you’re coming from or exactly what you’re trying to argue. If you’re arguing that IQ tests themselves are meaningless–which is the impression I’m getting–I’d say you’re definitely wrong. Like I said, the predictive validity of IQ tests is not in dispute and IQ tests are a good measure of the kind of intelligence that’s valued in the west.Even liberal publications like The Atlantic, who would have been dismissive of IQ testing just a few years ago, are publishing stuff like this today:http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/07/the-war-on-stupid-people/485618/“Few will be surprised to hear that, according to the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, a long-running federal study, IQ correlates with chances of landing a financially rewarding job. Other analyses suggest that each IQ point is worth hundreds of dollars in annual income—surely a painful formula for the 80 million Americans with an IQ of 90 or below. When the less smart are identified by lack of educational achievement (which in contemporary America is closely correlated with lower IQ), the contrast only sharpens. From 1979 to 2012, the median-income gap between a family headed by two earners with college degrees and two earners with high-school degrees grew by $30,000, in constant dollars. Studies have furthermore found that, compared with the intelligent, less intelligent people are more likely to suffer from some types of mental illness, become obese, develop heart disease, experience permanent brain damage from a traumatic injury, and end up in prison, where they are more likely than other inmates to be drawn to violence. They’re also likely to die sooner.”The bottom line is that group differences in intelligence exist, we don’t know how to change them, and it’s pretty much an inevitability that our national IQ will decline as Hispanics continue to replace native whites.Can you give me any reason to be optimistic about the hispanic-white IQ gap closing or narrowing significantly?

                                    You are confusing standardized testing and IQ testing. They aren’t the same, they do not function in the same manner. IQ testing scores rarely show a difference of more than a few % pts if you’re tested at age 6, then again at age 18.

        What makes me fighting mad, and I’m not just talking here, and I’m far from alone on this, is the gall of these self appointed elitists, they are at the core takers, robbers, destroyers, usurpers, they create nothing but cultural and economic wastelands for their benefit and enrichment. And they possess this unparalleled arrogance that after all they do in their selfishness and greed, those they perpetrate and foist their world and personal views upon through economic, specious regulation, and social terrorism, they despise and spit on us if we don’t submit and bend a knee to it. Never mind their indignation when common decent people rise up in righteous and lawful resistance. The dichotomy of it all is mind-blowing. Who do these jamokes think they are gods or something?No question about this global administrative tyranny, it is an unmitigated selective national and cultural disaster. It is a determined malicious conscious network of truly toxic savages with their noses and pinkies in the air in Brooks brothers suits, anathema to every idea in the birth and subsequent traditions of this great republic, the concepts of rule of law, the blessings of property, unfettered economic freedom, the primal right of self defense, and the will of the governed and our consent, of paramount and inalienable protections from rule of men and their politics, ideology, hubris, and or special interests otherwise known as greed and avarice.Well, when you deliberately, with malice and forethought, fuck with dirt people like these God-Damn nasty evil people do, rub our noses in this marxist/fascist crap, and then make us into enemies because we don’t like it, you start a revolution of people who aren’t going put up with it and tolerate no more being subjects, and the more you double down on the tyranny and usurpations against us, us dirt people are going to have no choice at some point in the not too far future of having to fight a bloody violent revolution to preserve and defend our basic primal rights as sovereign individuals and cultures.What else can be expected otherwise than becoming indentured slaves to this leviathan of administrative state and it’s deliberate selective targeted tyranny?

            Nietzsche warned of this in his ‘Parable of the Mad Man’“The madman jumped into their midst and pierced them with his eyes. “Whither is God?” he cried; “I will tell you. We have killed him — you and I. All of us are his murderers. But how did we do this? How could we drink up the sea? Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving? Away from all suns? Are we not plunging continually? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing? Do we not feel the breath of empty space? Has it not become colder? Is not night continually closing in on us? Do we not need to light lanterns in the morning? Do we hear nothing as yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying God? Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition? Gods, too, decompose. God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him.“How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it? There has never been a greater deed; and whoever is born after us — for the sake of this deed he will belong to a higher history than all history hitherto.”“Here the madman fell silent and looked again at his listeners; and they, too, were silent and stared at him in astonishment. At last he threw his lantern on the ground, and it broke into pieces and went out. “I have come too early,” he said then; “my time is not yet. This tremendous event is still on its way, still wandering; it has not yet reached the ears of men…”————————————————Perhaps the ears of men have finally been awakened.

        The most hysterical thing about the elite right now is that since people stopped believing their narrative, they have absolutely nothing to offer the voters. They didn’t have a backup plan to the narrative.I don’t think we have much to fear in terms of authoritarianism from the elites. Authoritarian rule requires either a popular mandate, loyal foot soldiers willing(and able) to kill innocent civilians on command, or both. The elites have neither. Also, the elites are cucks and don’t have the stomach for a fight with real casualties. They might try an administrative coup, but that would only multiply the resistance exponentially.

        Great essay.  The Trump (and Sanders) phenomenon represents a firm push back by those who would be crushed by the trends currently in place.  It is an expression of freedom, not a loss of it.  Note how the powers that be conflate a rejection of democracy, taught to the younger folks by their “educational” institutions, with the Trump election, which was driven by those who are older and have seen more.  They need to up their game to keep up with the rest of us.Any person with an IQ anywhere close to triple digits can see through all of this crap, if he has the notion to do so.  The moves to indoctrinate the intelligent and dumb down the rest are incomplete, and people are beginning to see exactly what has been going on, rather than just intuitive notions of something being seriously “off”.  The powers that be only know how to double down, at this point.  That just makes their tactics more obvious to the bystanders.

        As the widely attributed remark goes, “A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the majority discovers it can vote itself largess out of the public treasury.”  And it’s not like that latter hasn’t been happening a lot.

            Right. All the thumbsuckers are asking “How do we get them to feel better about the policies that made them stop trusting us?”
Not one floats the idea of government acting the the public interest as the public sees it. That idea is unthinkable. Which is exactly why nobody believes any more in what we now call “democracy”: The central “virtue” of our current “democracy” is that the people aren’t allowed to interfere in the decision-making process.

        The NYT never fails to astonish me:  from what was once the (somewhat tarnished) paper of record it has become an overflowing time capsule of contemporary idiocy.These Ivy League managerial types, preoccupied as they are with the sweet (and oh so lucrative) sound of their degrees, have failed to notice that whatever it was that they received for their money, it was not an education.  For if they had they would know that no member of that USSR Lite that is the EU could be remotely considered a liberal democracy, and neither is the unconstitutional administrative state in the US.  Further, if those degrees had come with something more substantive than jargon and opportunities for social networking, they would realize that if there has been a decline of liberal democracy over the past decades, it has been achieved through the very institutions these managerial morons have so vigorously championed.

        The American Republic was formed because the experience with democracy throughout the thirteen newly liberated colonies was frightening and without an end in sight. The object of the Convention was to promote several abstract principles for sustainable governance and to limit democracy.Fisher Ames-The agents that move politicks, are the popular passions; and those are ever, from the very nature of things, under the command of the disturbers of society…Few can reason, all can feel; and such an argument is gained, as soon as it is proposed. By securing property, life and liberty can scarcely fail of being secured; where property is safe by rules and principles, there is liberty, for the object and motives of tyranny are removed.

            It’s also a fact that the voters of Venezuela, in their stupidity and ignorance , voted into office Chavez.Representative democracy also allows for the citizenry to vote for a national suicide; a very real danger in any representative democracy and more likely as the electorate becomes ever more ignorant (witness the ground swell of support that that commie pig Bernie Sanders got.)We should not think that here in the USA the people could not elect a Chavez (or Bernie Sanders or Stein or the corrupt should-be-a-convicted-felon Hillary) as a president. After all, the voters elected Obama for president twice and FDR 4 times.Lastly , Trump could turn out to be a great president and do wonders for this nation; but for the ruling elites it will mean nothing at all. It would just cause them to hate Trump (and his supporters) even more.

                What are the ruling elites going to do? They don’t have a secret police or death squads, and aren’t likely to for the foreseeable future. I also don’t see the elites having the ability to silence the internet anytime soon.
The current situation came about because people stopped listening to the elites and their narrative. Without the narrative, they don’t really have any power. If the elites are to regain power people would need to start listening again. I’m not saying that’s impossible, but I’m all ears for speculation on how this could happen.

        Democracy devolves into ochlocracy (a word I love to trot out now and then to demonstrate my old-school erudition), “mob rule”, although to me it’s never more than a step away. Centralized government suits a managerial elite capable of convincing the voters (i.e. the mob, a.k.a as hoi polloi) that universal prosperity and the social utopia are just around the corner, never mind that said corner is at the intersection of Dream Street and Bullshit Boulevard. The best government is or should be local government, preferably presided over by a council of demonstrably wise elders.

            Finished Arendt’s On Revolution recently. She goes through a discussion of the contradiction of having a democratic system along with a managerial administrative state where these powers are bound to end up at cross purposes because they are really a mob vs an aristocracy with different names. She goes on to describe what has happened in every revolution in modern times in that small localized forms of government arise in the absence of the central govts that have been displaced by the revolution, which are then inevitably replaced with more centralized forms as things progress. She goes on to refer to letters written by Jefferson in his old age (this idea never made it into any of his more formal writings) where he encourages the division of state and local governments into tiny self governing wards which would then be the primary units of the more centralized layers above them. I think the idea is that the moderating influence over what would be a mob takes place at a lower level and is not left to higher and higher levels. What happens now is that the monkey on the back of the low level politician gets handed off to the guy above him and the guy above him until the governor or the president is left having to deal with the mob. With smaller units the mob formation is either complete, in which case it is justifiable, or the few instigators get shut up by their neighbors who don’t want any trouble.

                Jefferson apparently was disconnected from reality in this area as well.  The temptation of centralization has always existed because of human nature.Anyone who has spent time in a large organization knows that upward delegation attempts are constant.  IMHO this is due to the incentive structure for those below: Distinguish yourself and you might gain; Fail in the attempt and you are stultified forever; Do nothing and you keep your pay and simple attrition makes promotion likely.  So it takes constant vigilance and a small ego for those above to fight those forces by insisting that decisions be made at the lowest possible level.  Far easier to accept the flattery that only they,  being better and brighter, are far more capable than their underlings at understanding and deciding.

                    Yeah. In the text she notes that he never clearly defined what the exact role of the wards should be, what powers they would have, where the limits of jurisdiction would as related to superior powers, and what would sustain them. Keep in mind that he was old, writing letters, and hadn’t thought things through. I get the idea that she was open endedly speculating about what would happen if the organizations that spontaneously form in all of these modern revolutions were ever to survive, what form they would take, and what effect that might have on future political thinking.So far these have always been purposely destroyed, as in the Bolsheviks doing so to the spontaneous system of soviets, and then claiming to maintaining them as a fiction built into the name of the totalitarian government they then established.

        I do so love it when the Liberal Arts pretend to be sciences.  “Our model labels anything we don’t like as anti-democratic; stuff that we don’t like is happening; ergo, democracy is in danger!!!”  (Too bad we can’t keep holding votes until the voters get it right, as with the EU).  And the Alt-Right is falling faster for this flimflam than the reactionary Left, seemingly impossible as that is – cf. how Vox Day has gotten a bug up his ass for Peter Turchin’s “cliodynamics,” which pretends to quantify history with chaos theory or some such.  The only science in “political science” was settled (heh!) back in the 17th century — once you have a bona fide middle class, the Elite have to worry about maintaining legitimacy in their eyes, because if they don’t, an Oliver Cromwell type is always waiting in the wings.  But you can’t get tenure saying “Hobbes and Locke are the only political thinkers worth reading,” so I suppose we have to come up with yet another “model.”  Didn’t Francis Fukuyama become a national joke that way?  Or did history really end like he said it was going to, and I’m just misremembering?

                The history biz goes through bouts of science-envy every few decades.  It was “cliometrics” back in the 60s and 70s — take the median price of a slave in 1850, adjust for inflation, carry the one, and hey, now you have scientific proof that dead old white guys were evil.  Every academic colleague I’ve ever had was *still* all-in on socialism, but I’m sure they got the math right this time….

        Regarding the foreign-born at universities: they pay out-of-state tuition and will slave for advisors for a decade for $30-40k per year.  Educrats absolutely love them: a high-paying blank slate upon which to write Frankfurt-school Marxism.  The managerial elite, including the academics, will not stop short of total population replacement.  Unfortunately, due to our demographic winter, they just might succeed.  Even Trump voters are not made of the same stuff our fathers were.

            Of course not ALL trump voters are made of the “same stuff” our fathers were- no more than all those shooting at the Brits were of the same stuff as the tories and the “cucks” of that day. Breakup is coming: the demographic winter will only fall where whites are greatly outnumbered. Even there, I predict the defense will be of sufficient violence to prevent any attempted genocide.  I enjoy the Zmans take on the coming balkanization- there are many writing of this today, he seems to provide a bit more insight into the “how” that I am interested in. Geography will play a much larger role this time around than in the arbitrary land grabs during the “manifest destiny” era of railroad barons.

                I think the land grabs were made possible because of rail.  European immigrants to the American West had swift resupply of both personnel and material from Eastern ports.  The natives had no demolitions, or maybe no interest in using them.Bill Lind argues that rail and air travel are only possible under the stability provided by nation-states.  Prior to rail, everyone moved goods over water.  So you could be right: without the artificial unification of territory by rail and with worsening roads, geography might play a much bigger role in the future.Like Lind, I think ethnicity will be the longest pole in the tent and geographic boundaries will follow.  Low intensity 4GW towards still requires courage in short-supply amongst Americans.

        Democracy was always a disaster waiting to happen.  The Greek experiments with it were debacles. The story of Alcibiades and the Sicilian Expedition is my favorite example of idiotic unrestrained majority rule.  I also like the trial (by the people as there were no separate branches of government) and execution of Socrates for the crime of being annoying.

            My father was real estate developer in Florida late 60s through 80s.  All through the 70s one of the biggest markets for condos was Venezuelan flight money during the military dictatorship.  They  would literally purchase an entire floor of a condo building for cash.  Would rent the units, but in the event it was necessary to grab the first plane out of Caracas, there was both a hard asset and a roof over their heads.  It’s always been that way with South and Central America.  Buddy of mine who is a Portuguese born private banker down there was hoovering up acres of foreclosed houses and commercial properties for Brazilians after the 2008 crash.  Everyone down there thinks of capital preservation in a very different way than we do.
