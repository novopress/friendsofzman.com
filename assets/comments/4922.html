        The Greeks are humiliated because they’re living beyond their means, which requires begging from other people.  They’re angry because they don’t think they should be made to beg, but on the other hand they don’t want the alms to stop.I don’t find the Greeks’ attitude in this any more puzzling than I usually find it in people who chronically live beyond their means and cadge others and get mad about the “attitude” they have to swallow from the cadgees.  What is more puzzling is the willingness of German taxpayers to keep the vein open.  Is there no limit to the money they’ll spend to pretend that all possible economic systems are equally successful?

            The mistake here is this. The people did not borrow the money. A cabal of crooked families running the country borrowed the money. Greece was a oligarchy until Syriza win election. basically we have a situation where the rulers ran up debts, went off to their vacation villas while the creditors are pillaging the country trying to get back their money. The morality of individual borrowing simply cannot apply when looking at a country.

                What you’re saying feels wrong. Ordinary Greeks, while occasionally capable of mustering some mild discontent with their state and business / oligarch elites, generally seem to share the same cheating mentality, coupled with intense self-righteous nationalism.It’s not their oligarchs that they get worked up about and are mad at. Rather, they are out in droves denouncing Ms. Merkel as a Nazi, drawing her finance minister as a wheelchair-bound IS terrorist putting the blade to a kneeling Greek’s throat in an orange jumpsuit, and, their latest ingeniousity, comparing the most recent Eurogroup-Greece agreement to an Auschwitz-like extermination campaign against the Greek people.For them it’s apparently all about those evil German monsters, all the time — nevermind that a full 17 Eurogroup countries backed this latest agreement, as they did with all of the earlier ones. But can anyone in Greece (or in many circles in France, or Italy, or the US for that matter) even locate places like Latvia or Slovakia on the map, let alone distinguish them from Lithuania and Slovenia? Do those cold countries even have a right to exist?I’ve had it with the Greeks, let them go to hell. And yes, as you already guessed, I’m German.

        Sure, it’s imposing a “yoke” when you refuse to endlessly throw money after a profligate spender and notorious liar who on top of this insults you every other minute.
The Greeks are semi-Orientals: Whenever Mr. Tsipras sounds off on TV, it’s as much or even more about “dignity” and “honor” than about making a joint effort toward solving a joint practical / technical problem. Oh, and what about the dignity that lies in not lying and paying back the debt you owe?

        …As I understand the Greek problem:The Greeks have been living well beyond their means for a fair number of years.Most don’t work too hard, pay no taxes and retire early.Who can blame them?Greece has great weather, wonderful beaches, and lots of pretty European girls who come to vacation there.The European banks and the EU countries have been lending the Greeks the money to enable this leisurely lifestyle for years.Greece now owes their EU patrons €360,000,000,000.00.In recent years they’ve borrowed money simply to make the interest payments.Greece never had the money to pay these loans back and never will.Greece will never even be able to service the debt.The lenders knew this all along, but now like Claude Rains, they’re “shocked”that the Greeks can’t pay..Currently Greece can’t print its own currency and inflate away its debtlike the US can, the Greeks remain trapped by the Euro.Why is anyone bothering to continue this charade.Write off the Greek loans and move on.Greece should start issuing drachmas againGreece should be given humanitarian aid by the EUuntil it manages to re-establish some sort of a working economy.Here are the amounts we’re talking about.http://demonocracy.info/infographics/eu/debt_greek/debt_greek.html…

        So the obnoxious Greek protests against the Germans, calling them Nazis and demanding war reparations, are actually a logical piece of the puzzle, rather than a random outlier in the stream of events. In the context of this article, that Greek name-calling and the demands all make sense.
Separately, the “personal humiliation” closely follows what the so-called “Progressives” do to the rest of us, every chance they get.

        I have said this before so I will say it again as I like the sound of echoes. The whole thing — the west in general and certainly the EU in particular — is too complex to be managed as we think it ought to be managed. It cannot be led, it can only be organised. It cannot function without a consensus of people who all together and equally have no idea what to do.As increasingly there are no nations so there can be no figures to inspire or guide because no one has a responsibility or an affinity to something without borders, without shape.Today’s Europoliticians are floundering (though they do flounder in great comfort) as they struggle lamely to find solutions to problems that are too grand for them, too much for them to cope with. Of course, they give fine speeches and urge this or that, but they are speaking into an empty box… yes, the echoes sound good but that’s all.As to what would have happened had Hitler won, well the chances are there would have been no Soviet Union and with it, few idealised visions of communism. Marxism would have been finally (at least officially) buried. With Russia unable to rely on supplies sent via the UK had it fallen to Operation Sealion, the Soviets would have struggled and if Hitler’s lot had turned their thoughts to recruiting an anti-Russian force from the British Isles then Berlin would have more divisions to roll over the Commies.In the end, it would have turned out more like the EU now except there would be less pretending anyone else’s view counted. It would be 100 per cent Germany instead of the 80 per cent or so we have now.

        I don’t blame the Germans. Centralization and uniformity is a virus that is embedded in all humans.  We mistake the disease for the cure. For those who choose to live by the disease it is better to be ruled by Germans, who by temperament are better suited to it. The Greeks have made no case for exceptionalism for 2500 years, quite the contrary. But accidents happen. This  has the look of a continuing accident.Anyway, it’s been a fair number of decades since one wise soul or another observed that we are not going to vote our way out of this. But now it’s worse. Voting is actually the problem.

            The Greeks definitely are excepcional, they could have been even more if they had solved the “Abrahamic  Question” two thousand years ago.

                Aeneas you have a flawed premise here. The current Greeks are not genetically the Greeks of 2000 years ago let 2500 years ago as being conquered and inbred by asiatic immigrants replaced the white genetic ancient Greeks with a mixed race current people of lower mean IQ. White Sweden is going that route currently.

                    Germanic tribes made their way into Greece too. Lots of them. Blond haired Greeks, like blond haired Turks, are common. About 25% of Greek DNA is Asian, as in Near Eastern.

        Let us not forget the Imperial Capital. While today’s EU is basically Neumann mitteleuropa, Greece entered because of American pressure. Almost every public statement in dc was in favor of a deal .
