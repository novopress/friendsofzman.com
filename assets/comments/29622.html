        Well, Kelly just got absolutely annihilated in the Wisconsin race.  This is a harbinger of things to come.  Not to get caught up in the moment, but this was brutal.  I guess at some point the grifters on the Right are going to run out of false hope to sell their side.  This should be the top story of the night, not some fundraising ploy by Trump.

            I literally can’t believe what I am looking at.
I assumed that after the elites forced homosexual marriage on us, that pedophilia was the next stop.  I guess I was preparing myself for my Mom to call me and tell me how wonderful Elton John and his 15 year old boyfriend look together and isn’t it beautiful that love is love.
But I was unprepared for that photo.  I’m not a believer, but I can’t find a better word than “Satanic.”

                It’s not her son. I looked it up, and the dude in the dress is a trans activist who was there to receive some kind of award and spew nonsense about the evil nuclear family. But he’s not her son.

        Based on the outcome, it looks like this is just the latest pro-wrestling type angle to keep the normies fired up.

        We are seeing in the farce of the trial, playing out, the emerging system. At the top will be blacks, being black, as the urban warrior caste with various big men in charge of the cities and likely nation. Think Bragg at the top and his street warriors like Jamaqui’ running the street. Next down will be various “migrants” who will take up high positions, requiring some ability (like counting to four without fingers or toes) and they will be a mixture of Indian, Chinese, ((())) and various Latin American peoples. Next down will be the hereditary middle managers, the various Latinx people running the local LargeMart or Buymore. With the holy sacred trannies and the like as high priests. Muslims will be off to one side, and at the very bottom as beneath the law, will be straight White men. White women as long as they are gay, or attached to some non White guy, will be just fine. So don’t look for anything but utter hostility from most White women particularly the educated.Per the comment below, it is clear that this tool against Trump will be used to remove DeSantis, Abbot, Lee of Tennessee, Cruz, Rand Paul, Tom Cotton, others to clear the decks for Nimrata Randhawa and Liz Cheney as the designated losers. All sorts of lawfare is being prepped out as we speak. There will not be a Republican Party soon, as it will be outlawed effectively by distributed Blue City lawfare, likely extended to Trump voters, donors, and supporters. If they can hit him, they can hit you. And will.There is a limitless supply of men like Bragg, black, angry, wanting your money and groveling. The point being to humiliate you so they feel better. They run pretty much most blue cities. They won’t just get off at the Trump Station. They are riding the entire line.How sustainable this is remains in doubt. Silicon Valley is India Inc, but how effective and competent it is remains in question. Hollywood cannot make anything but woke propaganda not even the woke will see given how black lesbian, lesbian Asian, and Indian that place is now. Forget Ari Emmanuel, he’s moved on to the WWE/UFC. People like Mindy Kaling run Hollywood now. Mindy. Kaling. Real power depends on money, men, materials translated into military effectiveness. Supposedly there is a Ukrainian (read: Polish / US) offensive against Russia, the Donbass, and Crimea in the works for later this month or early May. I think likely the hinge of fate will depend on how well the Russians can defend against this widely signaled attack. Zelensky is running his mouth about Putin rotting in a cell, and the “last chance” for Russia so I assume it is going to be very big and aimed also at Russia directly, a knockout blow aimed at their air defenses and the sort of Baghdad / Thunder Run / Highway of Death action that Austin/Nuland/Raytheon figure is a sure thing. Which maybe it is, maybe it is not.

Another Whiskey classic.
“They run pretty much most blue cities”.
Luggage testers are obeying stooges who do what they are told.
There is a reason (I think it was Alexander the Great who said it), that,”The blacks take to slavery like no other race”. But it goes to one of the main rules of survival; avoid cities, (which are just organized crowds).

            No doubt some kind of escalation in Ukraine is coming, since that is the only option the GAE has. Every day that the war goes on and Russia lives is a signal to the world of the GAE’s weakness. To back down would be a catastrophe from which the GAE can never recover.

            How sustainable? it’s not sustainable at all. These various aggrieved identity groups can’t maintain their hierarchies on a college campus (see how they all devolve into infighting and petty fiefdoms). They can’t maintain it in big corporations (see how all the big tech companies are now stepping in and cleaning house of all these activists). They can’t even maintain a Soros grift with unlimited free money attached to it – see how the leaders of BLM stole donations and bought houses in White neighborhoods with it. That’s the point, these people are completely incompetent and know nothing. If this pyramid gets set up, it is going to collapse about five minutes later and we will just have to deal with the aftermath. Of course, this is probably inevitable – at this point the only way out is through.

                “They’re going to kill us.”
Thanks for the reality check. That the janissaries are disgusting, disposable foot soldiers is a feature, not a bug. The GAE and its MIC component understand the purpose of the military now is mass murder of civilians, foreign or domestic, rather than “winning wars.”

                I’m gonna white pill your comment if you don’t mind. Check out “heyjackass”, a crime aggregating site. Chicago has 2.4% of its shooting victims as white. Most of the offenders are luggage testers. That means most of the victims are black, with around 19% Hispanic. Which means most chimps are put down by other chimps. Was it in “The Prince” that Machiavelli said to don’t stop your enemy when they are making a mistake. They’re genociding themselves.
While it’s not always possible, avoid the groid and you will avoid trouble.

        How many Republican voters have asked themselves what or who comes next after Trump?Regardless of how you feel about him, his days are numbered.  He is on the way out.  Trump did indeed destroy the older and corrupt GOP, but failed to replace it with anything substantial.  Not only is the cupboard left bare, but the Left is more embolden than in the Obama days.  I can’t help but think conservatives are soon going to find themselves roaming in a political desert with no end in sight.

                    And American whites — like yourself — will sit and take it, sucking on your thumb and thinking about the Republican Party.
I’ve heard the same thing for the last two years from several middle-aged white conservatives I know. “They’re gonna’ kill Trump,” they say, sit back, crack a beer, and take a sip. These are the victories of the American male. Predicting things and remaining seated.

            It’s not the Republican voters’ job to gameplan the next five-to-ten years, it’s an impossible job to predict the future, and the GOP isn’t going to care. The GOP has never cared about what the voters say. Trump won just because he talked about the same things voters have been talking about for decades, like immigration and crime. Any Republican could have done in the past, oh, three decades, but they are institutionally incapable of it.Six years after Trump won the White House, in late 2022 the GOP showed just how much they learned from him by… striking a deal with the Dems to fully legalize homosexual marriage. There you go. How can anyone take this party seriously in an election after that? It’s over.

        The funny thing is that both sides understand in some way that something is very wrong with the current system. But neither side can put their finger on what is wrong. So they point fingers at each other. We have become a nation of “pooh slingers”. When a substantial portion of a populace has to drug themselves just to get through the day, maybe it’s time to question the founding principles of this country. Instead, both sides don’t really do this. Conservatives are especially guilty of this. If we just went back to the fundamental principles everything would be alright they claim. Didn’t some wag state that a good definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again while expecting different results?

            This is one of the most vapid comments I have every read, on any subject. The next time you have nothing to say, jut say nothing. Don’t write a paragraph of words that nets out to nothing and has negative utility to boot.
Both sides do NOT think there is something wrong with the system (and phooey on you for making them morally equivalent, by the way). The other side loves the current arrangement which allows them to parasitize and dominate. They ARE what’s wrong with the system.

        All correct, Trump wants to be the Schoolhouse Rock President we deserved, or he thought we deserved.He wants to make a deal that can’t be  made and NIXON COULDN’T make, and Nixon was a MASTER of truly far reaching Strategic Deals.As it happens toppling the Republic and replacing it with One Time Only Could It Work Fortified Democracy means you lost the Republic’s Army.They could in theory get another- but what of the warrior demographic still there in millions? We’re generational, there’s 14 million GWOT veterans, our families, our kin are police – we’re just walking away.As for Dem militia/ Hired Thugs they’re down to Trannies.  That’s sad.

            To add; you can get rid of the Army you’ve got and they are, you can in theory replace it, what do you do with the Army that left in disgust?  It would be suicide to act against it, it might be fatal to leave it idle and bitter waiting for a real leader to assemble it anew?
As one of many, had we one of our own as leader he’d merely have to say “Fall In.”   We know what should be done.

Honestly, I have my doubts. Then again, I have virtually no experience to base my doubts on, but I imagine the trans mind has to be a very disordered place.

Based on the screaming demand I’m seeing for technical help in the automation and defense spaces, I have to wonder if the government and military aren’t also scrambling to find technical people.
These technocrat dummies running the GAE really don’t seem to grasp that neither oil nor people are fungible.

                Either they are so detached from the reality on the ground that they thought Jeb’s endorsement would be good for DeSantis, or that was a deliberate attempt to scuttle him. I’m going with the former. Which means, yes they are that stupid.

                This is an important point that often gets overlooked. People having faith in the system keeps them compliant and productive so that they can be efficient tax cattle. There are at least some limits, theoretically, to their stupidity.

                She’s being positioned to lead the party that replaces the GOP when “Trump’s party” is outlawed. Biden in one of his whisper-threat dementia moments said that would happen before the 2024 election. The plan seems to be running behind schedule. No idea why. They could just say it on TV and it would be done, like how they made Biden president.

        In general a moderate can be a positive influence in his state and do a lot of good. That’s why they always look so good in the state office. Yet that same moderate, as President, is destroyed and co-opted by all the various forces before he even makes his first campaign speeech. DeSantis and Abbot are proud and embarrassing shills for Israel, but it doesn’t really matter in their states (outside of some token legislation that even they know is unconstitutional), whereas it becomes a huge problem as the chief diploment and commander in chief.i think even that warrior statesman, a true “America First” governor, would probably be better off by staying in his state and building up defenses against the weapons the federal government deploys on the people. The issue though, is personal – any quality you need to get to governor, you need to get to President, and those qualities guarantee that you will not want to stop at the state capital.

        “What is needed is a new consensus and that is made by immoderate men.”The problem is that there is no consensus. The population of the country is divided into three camps that will never agree. We’re at the stage of a marriage where everyone just wants out.White liberals and white conservatives simply have nothing in common. Their worldviews, cultures and beliefs are impossibly different. Non-whites will never have a culture similar enough to whites, so they’re also on their own.White liberals have hated white conservatives (especially Southerners) for a long time.Non-whites have also hated and/or despised (all) whites.The only thing that kept – and continues to keep – the lid on things is that white conservatives didn’t hate liberals and non-whites. White conservatives didn’t like them much, but there wasn’t hate in their hearts liberals and non-whites. They held out hope that they could find a way to get along with them one way or the other.That is beginning to change. White conservatives aren’t there yet, but they are starting to feel some very strong emotions toward white liberals. (They still hold on to their colorblind CivNat dreams, so they aren’t as angry at non-whites, though the Floyd riots pushed them down that road as well.)The 2020 election and the treatment of the J6 protesters woke up a lot of people, not to the point of hate, but a realization that something is very wrong. Trump getting indicted will push that farther.How long will white conservatives stay passive? I think that we still have a long way to go, but they are much more aware than in the past. And hate always starts with awareness.

            We’ll know when Tucker Carlson is the object of hate for the pre-emptive condemnation as Hitler that he promised whoever rises up and advocates for whites. He will even do that given that we are a minority and discriminated against.
When the gatekeepers are hated, say when his comment section is lit up like the Army’s recent ads, you’ll know the temperature is sufficiently hot.

                We’ll know when we see our GrillerCon neighbors start to cut off ties with liberal neighbors (and, maybe even, family members) and be very clear about why.
White liberals already do this all the time. But white conservatives cling to this idea that they can convince the other side.
When you see white conservatives walking away from white liberals, you’ll know that the world has changed.

                        Do any of Biden’s little muppets ever go outside the Libsphere though? I’m not sure what incident you might be referring to but I suppose some Trump cabinet member was kicked out of a restaurant by some shitlib restaurant owner. Trump’s people though were often forced simply by geography to visit hostile territory and the businesses therein. Do any Bidenoids ever try to get a meal at a diner in Podunksville, SC? That seems to be one of the things that’s changed. The Left doesn’t need to pretend to care about flyover country anymore so they don’t experience the hate the people have for them.

            “ How long will white conservatives stay passive? I think that we still have a long way to go, but they are much more aware than in the past. And hate always starts with awareness.”White conservatives, the only group to recruit as you note, are fence sitters.  They will remain fence sitters until the spark is struck that eliminates passivity and forces them to reveal choise (via action).  Even if 80% would choose the DR camp, they will remain passive until that time.I personally don’t think it’s a matter of time until passivity abates, but that of a string of events striking that spark occurs.  A subtle difference I admit, but one that directs where future efforts should be devoted.

It seems to be doing so quickly.One thing I have noticed about True Believers of any strike is that once they are disabused of their fantasy, they make for very nasty opponents. Most Normies will be too fat and worthless to do much, but a lot of them will not be. Whether due to lack of confidence or insanity or both, the Regime has set into motion things that will undo it eventually.

            For myself, my racial hate rankings have White liberals at the top spot. I would never socialize with them or tolerate them at any kind of gathering I was organizing. Then again, I’m not a griller and never regarded them as redeemable. I’d let in a few token Blacks or Mexicans though on a case by case basis as it were.If I were *forced* to admit White shitlibs I might make sure to also let in the most obnoxious and criminal Blacks and beaners possible and then watch the festivities from a well fortified position. Enjoy the diversity shitballs, now DIE for it!

                    Trump is a true believer CivNat. The case has no legal legs, so he just assumes that it will be thrown out at some point.
Of course, he doesn’t understand how the country has changed, but this is what he believes.
He also believes (correctly) that by following the process and winning, he locks in the nomination. In Trump’s mind, he’s in zero danger and this indictment gives him the nomination.

                        If that’s the case, Trump is more obtuse than he appears. He knows the Power Structure stole the 2020 election; how could he not know that they’ll railroad him in the courtroom?
Trump will spend his final years rotting in a dungeon, and nobody will lift a finger to spring him. Turn about’s fair play, I suppose; Trump didn’t do dicksquat for all those political prisoners who went to the mat for him on J6.

        Great post.  I totally agree.  Given Trump’s failures on nearly everything that mattered.  Profound failures, leaving hundreds to rot in a D.C. dungeon, among others, I think the best way he can redeem himself is by being a sacrifice.  A perfect sacrifice for our side.  During this Holy Week, that Manhattan Courtroom can serve as Pilate’s Palace.  Rikers Island can be the new Golgotha.  Last night was Trump’s agony in the tower.  Only Trump isn’t the type to turn to God and ask for his will to be done.  He is is own god, so he can sit in the cell asking himself why his worshipers weren’t worthy of him.  The sh–ttiest people on Earth, NY libs, can stand in a mob and scream in their own way “crucify him!”  Only this story has no redemption at the end.  The only hope it brings is that the crooked system convicts itself while it convicts the orange savior.  The god that failed…..(play Metallica song)

            I am unable to refute your assertion that NY libs are in fact the shittiest people on earth. I would rather be surrounded by west coast libs than the NY variety. That’s how bad they are. I would even rather live in a stew of vibrancy as the lone white man. Or as I used to say in my south florida days, “I’d rather live next door to a thousand Cubans than 10 NYers.”

                    And nobody out-Libs a Southern Leftist. They’re from the part of the world most tainted by the greatest moment of villainy in the history of the cosmos, the enslavement of the sainted Hutu. And to cleanse themselves of the contamination, they must clobber everybody over the thinkpot with their Leftism incessantly.
But really, all Leftists are utterly vile, are they not? You might as well be debating whether you’d prefer amoebic dysentary, anal cancer or septacaemic plague.

            He can be a martyr. He probably doesn’t want to, but it’s his one chance to, perhaps, change history. The sight of Mr Trump being strapped into Old Sparky would cause the scales to fall from the eyes of a lot of folks.

                    Lech was dealing with relatively civilized people–I lived in Poland when he and Solidarity were underground and never got the sense he was in the kind of danger that Trump is in.  Jaruzelski was not anywhere as close to as scary as our PTB are.

            And there’s still a sealed indictment waiting. Whatever is really going on, I don’t think he groks the fullness of Trump Derangement Syndrome. It’s not a joke when your name is Trump.Those dozens of new “felonies” are misdemeanors for business practices that were bumped over the line by claims of conspiracy to other, not-yet-named crimes, from what I’ve been told thus far. It’s so fake and gay.“We indicted you on hush money to a whore… and, um, other charges.”“Okay, I’ll turn myself in, but no handcuffs, mug shots, fingerprints, prison uniforms or autographs.”“Done! By the way, we found three dozen new felony charges against you… and, um, other charges.”“See you Tuesday.”

                Yes, this is true, but incomplete.  Congress passed a “public accommodation” law in the late 19th century and the courts struck it down as blatantly unconstitutional and an attack on property rights and freedom of association.
Now, rather than protecting a defending against growth of state power in the most evil ways, the courts are now the engine of destruction.
Much of the evil has come directly from the post war courts.  The “civil rights” stuff, the gay marriage stuff, the abortion stuff….

        Right. The Cold War society we all grew up in (even people being born now), lost its reason to exist 30 years ago, has been running away since.I was listening to Jay Dyer and Col. MacGregor’s son yesterday. There was the idea that the people running the machine don’t know what it takes to run it. I wonder if the problem is that the machine needs to go, but nobody has a good idea of what to do next.Personally, I’d be building for a multipolar world, but the leading idea seems to be collapse into techno-feudal Wakanda, which is a retarded nerd-spook-cuck wet dream in my estimation. This crap was cooked up in the 70s, when the Cold War was still a big deal. People did a lot of evil shit and made evil compromises to beat the commies, only to become a deranged reflection of them. That should tell you how real that conflict was.Reality needs to intrude, so people get their heads right. And that intrusion should probably go to money, media, and tech— all the things people have been consumed and controlled by.

        To be fair to Mr. Trump, he gets a lot of flak from the right, especially from the DR, for having been unable to do impossible things. He could have tried harder, spoke better, organized more effectively, yet the impossible, trying to work within the structure of our once constitutional republic to commandeer and redirect an openly hostile federal bureaucracy, remains impossible.Our formerly constitutional republic, to function as such, required people who were able to share power. People who could accept losing elections, and follow orders from their ideological opponents. There is nobody like that remaining on the left. That is not hyperbole, I mean nobody. And for 16 of the 24 years that preceded Mr. Trump’s election, the Clintons and Obamas were staffing the federal bureaucracy with those people. An effort that continues today with the Biden administration. The other 8 years, Bush was staffing it with the ideological allies of McConnell, Ryan, and Romney. So that it makes no difference whether you elect Marcus Aurelius, Kemal Ataturk, or the Duke of Wellington, the edifice which they are supposed to govern is ungovernable. At least by them.

            Look, no intelligent supporter thought Trump was going to bring the 1950s back. That said, the man did more to block his own policies than his enemies did. There was no reason to fall out with Sessions, or bring Kushner in, or put his brain-dead daughter in charge of anything, and yet he did. Sure, completely draining the swamp was impossible, but letting his supporters sit in jail is simply unconscionable, and it’s his own fault for that.

                A lot of people still think Jan 6 was a terrorist attack.  My ex marine buddy in the midwest said ‘i’d kill every last one of em’ the day after it happened.  Even the boomerservative buddies of my dad think it was an attempt to overthrow the gov by a militia or something.  I can only imagine what trump’s terrible intelligence agencies were telling him.

                “Look, no intelligent supporter thought Trump was going to bring the 1950s back.”I doubt anyone did, intelligent or otherwise. I didn’t, though I voted for him twice. Mine was more a protest vote than expecting anything from Trump. Furthermore I — like a lot of people — expected my protest vote to be futile. I was amazed when Trump won by a whisker in 2016. For voters like me it goes beyond Trump. We voted out of protest and desperation for Trump. The key point is that the system is broken at every level. Humpty-Dumpty can’t be put back together again.  The apologists for the system — those who still derive some benefit from it — take aim at Trump because in so doing they take aim at us. If Trump gets incarcerated they’ll have to find some other bogeyman because this destructive frenzy is all they’ve got going for them. They have no positive program. Internationally and domestically the country is in a deepening crisis.

            From a race-realist standpoint, trump’s the only politician in decades to say things like ‘mexico’s sending rapists,’ ‘if you don’t like it here, why don’t you go back to your old country,’ and recommend a muslim ban.  From an execution standpoint, he knows the boomerservatives well, and gave them what they wanted:  tax cuts, 400 miles of wall, and a booming economy via reduced regulations.  I was one of those people who didn’t even think about race until trump’s enemies called us all nazis.  That was his greatest achievement.  Blacks, latinos, feminists, even asians, liberals, gays, and trannies all showed their fangs, exposing their hatred and resentment for straight, white men.  I’d be defending Dave Rubin or something if it wasn’t for seeing how hated we are.  For dissidents, he was the perfect accelerationist candidate.

After Washington died and was unable to serve as sovereign (king) aka a decisive authority to resolve fractional disputes the feuding between Jefferson and Hamilton was intense.Republics only work in small political unit like Geneva or Venice because the external threats force the ruling class to remain united. Without external threats the USA has lurched from one delusional leftist project to another.

                    Long-time practicing attorney here. Exactly this. I am approaching retirement age. I attended a top-tier law school decades ago, when the Marxists were just beginning their takeover of the institution. The takeover was complete within five years. I am horrified by what I see happening in law schools today but it was completely predictable decades ago, and in fact I predicted it.There is no negotiating or reasoning with these people. This ends in violence, with the losing side side in camps. Our side is losing now, badly.Their side is miscalculating badly by indicting Trump. The memes write themselves–Joe Normie, they are coming for you next. And the memes are not wrong.

                        The Trump indictment shows how reckless and impulsive these types are. It also shows them to be very, very dangerous. It is why I have been genuinely concerned they could be psychotic enough to ignite a nuclear war with Russia.
Some attorney friends have suggested to me that the Anglo-American tradition of loyalty to the client first has disappeared and it is now loyalty to the Apparat first. Do you think that is that true? If so, the bedrock is gone completely.

                        ^ No, the only path out of this is if the Right starts copying blacks and muslims and minecrafts the police into avoiding contact.  Then the Regime is only stuck with heroin-addicted street thugs and these east coast Jewish cat ladies with which to defend themselves, and it becomes a simple matter of rounding all the leftists up into camps, extracting all the viable organs to sell to the Chinese to pay off the national debt, and processing the remaining material into quality pet foods.

            If you want just a small window into the mind of your average woke lefty woman, this is truly a must read.“Jury of your peers”? LOL! The 7th amendment is dead &amp; buried. Woke cat lady, Tyrone, Shaneequa, Juanita, and Pajeet Patel are –not– your peers. Other than the brainwashed lefty lunatic white lady, they are scarcely even the same species anymore. These are the people who are going to judge you? Right…All of DC, and I would speculate most every other sh-tlib lefty enclave is like this. This is why, in spite of the horrendously unfair financial damage that was done to me, I truly feel I dodged a bullet because I got one of the last neutral judges in the hivemind. Had the stuff I was tangled up in back then occurred today I’d be in very dire straits as would anyone without the ‘proper’ point of view / skin tone.These systems are far beyond repair now and exist only in the way that most “legal systems” in other corrupt countries operate, along political and tribal lines. Get involved in it at your own peril.Every time I read an article like this or simply interact with “the locals” (a rarity nowadays, mercifully) I am reminded that I and anyone else still within even a wide orbit of blue hives needs to run not walk to the nearest exit, permanently.

        As a country, America is now a depreciating asset.  There was a time when it was a Lamborghini fresh off the lot, but now it is on its way to the junkyard.  In terms of patriotism, America is already in the dark ages.  I wish it wasn’t the case, but there is no denying it.  Republican voters are desperate and grasping at straws for any sliver of hope.  Unfortunately, things will get worse before they get better.  Just my two cents, but 2020 was the year the voting bubble broke.

Composed of a highly intelligent, educated, and industrious citizenry, and with a proneness to high fertility and strong controls promoting high-investment parenting, it might have become a world power.”Kevin MacDonald on Massachusetts bay colony

        I disagree with the point that this is a system destroying itself. This arrest seems to be an exercise in demonstrating power, not the thrashing of a system falling apart. I believe too often people believe that the exercise of power is the signal that the system is failing. Perhaps the naked exercise of power, as nicely described in the courtroom, is the establishment of legitimacy (such as it is) for the new age. People keep saying, “This will be the thing.” But, from my perspective, each degradation of the white populace only leads to further acquiescence. Sure, grumbles appear – but normal white people spend too much time saying this will be the thing and not enough baboonery to actually accomplish anything. They do, white lament. I just do not see how this trend will reverse or the system will fail.To those who say, “Why don’t you do anything?” my point exactly. I have a wife and kids to worry about. I do not want to become Lavoy Finicum. The only time I would ever act is when a direct, tangible threat (e.g. CPS) appears to threaten my child. Then a few bodies will pile. Short of that: nothing. This is the essence of the quandry: those who are best suited to fix this septic tank of a country are the ones who have emotional connections that they will not sacrifice for a degenerate audience. That is what makes us better than them. But that is also what makes show trials like Trump’s effective.During a famine, I would do anything for my family to help them survive, for I cannot fix the famine. So too with the famished decency in this degenerate age. The ability to discourage action is the effective tool the system uses. It’s the beginning of the New Age, not the end of anything.

            Well put but I disagree in part. Even though today’s insanity also is irrational and deranged, what the Regime is doing here is not a sign of a confidence. The flex is a needless, counter-productive circus. But, yeah, people who are well fed and not immediately threatened will not revolt. Why would they? It seems, though, that housing, food, and personal security no longer are guaranteed for the long haul and some of that, starting with energy, is actual public policy. The mounting humiliations will explode when those are gone. Much of what is happening is an attempt to pre-empt reaction but ultimately will prove a self-own.

                Where will they direct that anger? To me, the natives will feast upon those in proximity (the white devil), not the people responsible. A generation with no critical thinking ability will not be able to focus; they will thrash about in proximity. Then the white devils will beg for security from the very bastards that caused that. In famines in the past, people become inert. Now, I may be ignorant of an example, but in most modern famines, the population simply starves while the elites keep their guards fed. I am thinking of North Korea, China, and India. Hell, the Irish Potato famine for the Western World. Normalcy bias is as strong as hope, and both generally die with the host.Firther, who says it has to get to quite that point. Why are all these elites buying farmland in America? Maybe they will give you just enough to live in exchange for complete compliance. Take your daily covid vaxx for you weekly mutant corn mush. Then, if you don’t like it – that is your fault, and you can starve to death. That coercive authoritarianism seems to appeal to their vanity.

Maybe they will give you just enough to live in exchange for complete compliance.”Intentionally or not, it is the endpoint of current policy. The elimination of fossil fuels will make fertilizer and sufficient production basically impossible. De-dollarization similarly is undermining the United States’ so-called “services sector,” and coupled with the hollowed-out industrial sector that means consumer goods also will be hard to get. There literally is no way out now, and to be clear, I do not look forward to the coming deprivation. The nomenklatura will be lucky to get scraps.The example that best supports your point is the Holmodor in the Ukraine, but that laid the groundwork for the Ukrainians’ alliance with the Nazis and lots of dead apparatchiks and proles alike. Starve and mistreat citizens and Banderas is what you deserve and get. It is quite ironic that the Ukraine/Russia war the United States provoked this time will deprive it and its satrapies this year (inventory prevented this last year) of food and fertilizer.

                        But climate change controls are for the proles, not the elites! We won’t have cars, but they will have planes and yachts. They will still use fertilizers and fossil fuels, but we will be taxed for the privilege — and controlled. And the Holodomor is the perfect example: Ukraine was part of Russia for decades afterwards.

                        @Eloi:The elites depend on a vast army of apparatchiks and mercenaries, and those are the ones who will feel the pain along with those not directly part of the system. That’s the Achilles Heel.Also, there will be no Red Army at the elites’ disposal to restore lost ground. Yes, they would use biological and chemical weapons as necessary but those are a two-way street. Just as nukes have made every nation a peer, these hideous weapons achieve factional parity despite other disparities. We aren’t talking about rational people here, again. We can hope so, but all evidence suggests otherwise.The only was out for them now is some form of modus vivendi and these people probably are too crazy to pull that off. Again, to be clear, while this will be good for those of us who manage to live in the long term, it will prove horrible in the medium and short.

I don’t think the Woke Mob could survive if a state guard or even citizens ready to go full bore. I was referencing the functionaries of the State, though, to be clear. At some point, and that could be soon, the central government will be unable to support them. Yes, they would get first dibs on food and energy but that will be limited to what is available. My guess is the elites plan to bug out long before that point.

                Concerted, coordinated demonstration of power over half the population is far removed from a systemic collapse. Those Chinese struggle sessions were really a sign of weakness, right?! I think if you work with young people, you will see that the AOCs and Powers That Bes are INCREDIBLY effective at indoctrinating the youth – they have secured the future. Sure, growing pains – we see now. But the slavish adherence to the system has been effectively built into the system since the Boomers, and the youngest generation is by far the most dependent. But to say I live in fantasy is an insultingly twisted statement.How old are you to speak patronizingly? Late 50s, mid 60s? Keep in contact with a wide range of the youth these days, and then tell me I am wrong.I believe too many exist within their small social circle and assume that applies to the wider world in an equal proportion.

                    The indoctrination has been wildly successful but the indoctrinated are largely useless. Yes, they can be very dangerous, but unlike the Red Guard these are very weak foot soldiers and have never known deprivation. I strongly suspect that once hit in the jaw they fold and fold quickly. The same probably applies to the system. It is about to be put to the test and we will soon know on that point (there is an economic implosion unfolding).

                    I am watching the tv series Lucky Hank with Bob Odenkirk, post-bettercallsaul. The characters are ludicrous, whiney and entitled, but seem to think they know it all, and I am hard pressed to tell whether it’s satire or this is really a reflection of their world.

        Most Americans are furiously burying their head in the sand trying to avoid the obvious demise of USA Inc. Japan is now buying Russian oil with rubles and both Saudi Arabia and Iran are now selling oil in currencies other than the dollar. The plates are wobbling and may drop at any moment. The French have had it WEF flunky Macron and are burning the place down in anger. Will fat-ass normie take to the streets here? Yes, as soon as his belly is empty. And Brandon is banking on the Hail Mary Pass of a Ukrainian offensive victory to save the day.Enough brutal honesty. What to do? Well, it very likely is going to get much worse much faster. Big cities with large black populations are going to erupt in mayhem/violence and LEOs are going to be ordered to begin cracking skulls. Can you see the fog coming in? What will DC do? Will Biden start WW3 and nuke the planet? Will the RINOs go spastic with their faux investigations? Will the 2024 election be already declared a victory for democracy/Biden and finally demonstrate the futility of voting harder? Inquiring minds want to know.

        In the lead up to the fun times of the Civil War, from 1859 to the spring of 1861, state governors, both North and South, were absolutely key to how the final breakdown happened. The secession winter of 1860 was not led by a singular Southern national figure, not John Breckenridge, the Southern Democratic nominee for President in 1860, certainly not Jefferson Davis, the man who became President of the Confederacy. It was a coalition of the seven Deep South state governors. The state legislature of Texas had to literally remove Governor Sam Houston from office to secede. Lincoln, while the President-elect, spent almost all his time jockeying with the state governors of the North and with the undecided and vital border states. Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina did not secede until President Lincoln demanded that those state governors raise troops to put down the rebellion, at which the state governors held referendums in their states and seceded.At this point, a working coalition of state governors rather than a fat orange Yankee buffoon is a safer bet for the coming showdown. Will it happen like 1861? Of course not, because the Florida Man surely is not Madison Perry.

            It has been interesting to watch formerly squishy Tennessee getting into this groove. It has publicly sanctions and may be about to expel Negro legislators from its state house for starting a violent riot last week. There is no way in hell the national Republicans would do such a thing.
This split between state and federal legislators is a very positive development.

        The US Army video:  Being on the outside of mainstream politics for many years, one of the most encouraging things I’ve seen is reading the comments on youtube videos of various subjects like this one.Others include videos the ADL puts out with local newscasts horrified at flyers distributed showing one group with vast disproportionate power.  Some are videos which show diversity or fatness or antiwhiteness or something in a positive way.The comments today are always 90 percent or more of ridicule and laughter.  This is good, because I can remember not that long ago being frustrated reading comment sections because so many were supportive of the various leftist or Con Inc. content.

            Con, Inc., has been disabling comments for some time. National Review, for example, did so during the 2016 election. Z writes from time to time we were trolling the NR comments but that’s not exactly accurate. It was more like Nick Fuentes’ 15 minutes of usefulness with the Groypers asking Con, Inc., questions that exposed its fraudulent nature and impotence. NR’s competitor, Am Greatness, is starting to limit responses for the same reason.

                Not only that, confront the Sacred Cow / Numinous Negro at your own peril. You are ALWAYS wrong, even when you are not… “He called me a racial slur”. Your word against the word of a deity. Whether you did or not doesn’t matter, in the mind of the lefty lunatic, you did so anything that happens to you afterwards is justified.And they are well aware of this now which is why they are getting far more aggressive. I stood up to a loudmouth brown guy who needed it many years ago. It only cost me 7 years of financial destitution. And that was JUST before the Woke Nightmare began. What would be the price today?

        Locking up a populist leader in a time of inflation and rampant debauchery?  I’m sure such a scheme has worked out fine in the past, right?(Of course I suspect this is why GAE is terrified to let any dissidents back out of jail and eventually scrapes together enough charges in front of a friendly court to send everyone away forever).

        “Even if he is too old to see it or too afraid to acknowledge it, the spectacle itself is opening the eyes of many people. This is not about Trump, but about a system that no longer works as intended. Instead, it has become a weapon in the hands of bitter, deranged fanatics. A system that can so easily be perverted to destructive ends is no longer worth defending. That is the new consensus forming up as we see the system destroy itself in these rage panics.”This is spot on. For a time, the deranged fanatics had considerably more support because of bin Laden’s observation: if people see a weak horse or a strong horse, they will go with the strong horse. The deranged fanatics had been the strong horse albeit a strong crazy horse, but events have spiraled beyond their ability to shape them. The world is moving beyond the United States at a rapid clip now, and many of the people held hostage inside its clutches are starting to join them, at least mentally. To quote myself from a previous comment here (shameless, I know), the Regime is now shouting at the clouds “I will not be ignored!” BOM is their bunny, I suppose.Trump always was useless as a leader. By the time he came along, even if he had been one of us, it was far too late to effectuate change within the system. As a symbol, though, Trump is invaluable. It is why I celebrate what is happening today, and hope the psychopaths go full Epstein on him. If they kill him or keep him off the ballot, I will go to the polls simply to write him in as a “no confidence” vote on the United States. Sure, it is a meaningless gesture but will feel good.The United States has been a shuffling zombie quite some time. Today the deranged fanatics are conceding as much as they try not to be ignored one more time.

                Yep, but I’m glad the State is doing it because it (a) further repels the international community and (b) shows Normie what is what. If the Regime were sane it would make damned sure BOM was not at risk. The Regime is crazy, of course.
There could be a convergence between Trump’s vanity and the State’s malevolence, though: BOM could post bond and defect to Russia and set up a government in exile. It would be freaking hilarious but we likely will be deprived that good laugh.

        Operate America for the benefit of Americans. Bring the troops home from the 500+ overseas bases. Invest in Americans. F### the rest!

            FNC1A1, as an American, I’m curious why you see the USA as salvageable but not Canada.  I’m more pessimistic than you because, even if we did the things that you listed, our elites still have the dispossession of traditional whites as their highest goal, and that goal is non-negotiable.
Our elites can only be dislodged by means that I can’t discuss here.

                Among other things, Canadian culture is far more deferential to power structures than American culture. Rebellion isn’t in our history nor even in our nature. Even protesting here tends to be calm and low key. The trucker convoy that hit Ottawa last winter was a tremendous exception to the rule.And don’t think that Canada’s elites aren’t also all-in on white replacement. We’re importing close to a million residents a year now mostly from east Asia and from India.No, Canada is lost, lost, lost. We are complacent, we are apathetic, we are risk averse, we are not productive, we are capital P Progressive, and so long as we can point south and say, “Better than THEM!” that’s all anyone needs to justify it.

                    Canada as a nation is completely finished. Canadians as people are still doing okay, though.We have a very low race mixing rate. Our white birth rate is higher than the USA if you remove mixed babies to white mothers.Also our east and south Asian imports have extremely low birth rates, especially those born in Canada. Unlike the USA which has high fertility Hispanics. Their assimilatiom os very bad too.If immigration were halted today, Canada would immediately stabilize and demographics would get better over a few generations. Not so in America.They’re swamping us in 10x the immigrants as the USA because only through sheer numbers can we be overrun.

                        I happened to catch part of the late game on HNIC a couple weeks back.  I think the Oilers were playing.
My God – it was “Pride Night” for the Oilers, and that backstabber Ron MacLean and the others were wearing their rainbow flag pins.
Furthermore, the guy calling the game was a towel head that could have been an Osama Bin-Laden look-alike.  Love to see that thing lace up a pair of skates.
They’re just overtly poking Heritage Canadians in the eye now,

                    My thought as well.  Wilson was also pretty awful, as he bungled us into one world war and set the conditions for a second.  Bush is a lot like FDR, who set up a welfare system for white people.  It may have seemed reasonable at that time in history, but then LBJ came along and turned it into a shitshow.  Same with Bush.  The Patriot Act may or may not have been reasonable after 9/11, but it took Obama to turn it into tyranny.  But Bush was the father of it.

            Biden is not an acting executive; he is in Stage 4/5 dementia. So it’s not possible to talk about Biden as a “good” or “bad” President. Otherwise I agree, the Biden Politburo has accelerated wokeness, opened the borders, and sparked inflation. The only thing that can be said for them is they haven’t got us in a nuclear war or collapsed the currency. Yet.Jorge Arbusto staffed our national security bureaucracies with ideologically deranged neocons, greatly enriched and entrenched the MIC and accelerated the Great Replacement of us by his sister-in-law’s relatives. He also put a lot of weird non-profits on the federal teat. In a number of ways that are still playing out he destroyed conservatism as a political movement. Recall too this was the era of John “Maverick” McCain and the equally toxic Joe Lieberman and “Miss” Lindsay Graham, who did their own poisonous work.Really, the 00’s were what we now know as the beginning of the end, the hollowing-out and eventual collapse of our institutions.

            Agree. Bush as the worst prez?  Not even close.  Start with Lincoln, then FDR, Wilson, and LBJ.  This is at least the second time Z has cast Brush as the worst.  Z, should open and read other than state approved history articles and books.Bush is in running for the fifth worst, but is tied with Cliton, Obummer, and Bite-me.  Of these Obummer wins because of his racial hatred toward whites and the country whites elected him to run.It was here Obummer ushered in the idea that the US must be brought down to the level with the rest of the world and superior in no way to others.  The great leveling started with that dumb street hustler and homo and in his third term at present the destruction continues: Make the southwest Mexico again.  Make whites slaves to blacks.  Make whites love their demise and third class citizenship, and, sadly, many have accepted their slave status.One reason Trump is being brought up on fake charges is related to the Big Nigg Bragg DA.  Sure he serves a greater master but in the Nigg world, he is a hero for bringing down the most powerful white man on the scene; ‘take that white man, we be in charge now, you bees the slabes now.’  In the process he will have saved the deep state.If the injustice of the Brunswick Three, Chauvin, and many others, don’t drive home the point, Trump’s destruction will.So, Big Nigg Bragg saves the deep state.  The wild card for now is Putin.

            It almost always seems the current occupant is the worst. Oddly, though far from the best, Trump was the only one in recent memory to buck that trend.

        “What is needed is a new consensus and that is made by immoderate men.”I doubt there’s any to be had. The emerging era will be one of fracture. The expiry date of the USA as a national entity is in the past. Fracture, confusion, mayhem, secession, internecine conflict, and various kind of collapse all lie in the near future. But be of good cheer — this is not the first time this has occurred historically. The collapse of empires in antiquity, the collapse of the Bronze Age, and so on gives us clues to what to expect and how to survive, and eventually something emerges from the rubble.

            Times have a funny way of producing the men the times demand. In hindsight, this seems obvious, but in the moment it is not clear. The Indians produced some great leaders in their fight against the white man, even though the numbers were stacked against them. We are in no where near the same desperate state as the Indians. In the short tun, things are bad, but in the medium and long term, the bell curve will once again be the deciding factor.

                Unfortunately there are a lot of small hats on the right side of that bell curve.

                    It’s not so much intelligence as ruthlessness and, to use their own quite apt term, chutzpah. And tribalism on steroids.

            Agreed, but this will be the first time an empire has collapsed while armed to the teeth with nukes and under the spell of sickos who would use them.
