        That terrifies me. How I live now means I never have to bow to woke culture because I work alone in my own business I don’t watch TV or movies or sporting events. I thought Friendster was creepy when all my friends tried to get me to join so by the time Facebook came along I was immune to social media.  I actually read very few books that are even written by living authors. I’m entirely removed from the culture. But I am afraid that one day the culture will come for me anyway. Everyday I tell myself to look at my life and be grateful for it and to remember how good it is no matter what may come.

            You have a wonderful perspective.  What you’re doing is really the only path to freedom, contentment, and joy.  Conformists like to suck the energy from free people … the dissident’s job is to deny the parasites a host.
One day the culture may come for us; in many ways that’s happening right now.  Fear not … you’re not alone in this battle.

            Same here re: work.  My level of personal engagement with clients is minimal and usually arms-length.  I’m fortunate to work in a field where the work product largely speaks for itself and usually requires craft-level involvement rather than being “mass-produced” by macros, boilerplate language and Pajeet mimicry (ala (((LegalZoom))) etc.)  If I hadn’t done this when I did, I would have crashed and burned years back.

            Rebellion against the system must begin with the young. Easy as it may be to say “Sign me up with a Social Credit Score ZERO!”, how many will actually do this?How many men with families to support, with decades invested in a progressive career path, and a very decent income would put it all at risk for a pig in a poke?Easier to submit to the poz, and hope for the best. And the water gets hotter, and the frog gets slowly boiled.Alas and Alack.To paraphrase, “You may be disgusted by the culture, but nowhere near as much as the culture is disgusted by you”.

        Well… I see a few minor problems for our aspiring overlords. When they send out wammin and queers to impose order – everyone politely pays lip service and then leaves. Most of  those high profile churches that went queer or feminist back in the day are now closed. Alt Tech is just rubbing their palms together with glee and smirking like Shylock at the thought of an SJW assault on OyTube. Hate sites like this one are proliferating and gaining traction. As the NRx fellas note… holiness spirals only end one way.When I was banished from my family it was as you say: I had the wrong opinions and ethics, and the women and queers had no choice but to give me the boot. After I left, the purges continued. Divorces and estrangements continued apace. Once I was gone they went after each other. Women and queers can’t run a family, never mind communities, nations or businesses. Eventually they fail.We really need to focus on what comes next.

            Power based entirely on Talmudic morality and intellectual witchery is ephemeral.  In a rock, paper, coinage struggle, rock always wins if the Kshatriya keeps his frame.  A man who no longer cares if he’s “right” or “wrong” by enemy standards and can’t be bought can only be out-rocked.  The dangerous game our Cathedral and Wall Street elites are playing ultimately ends with an Attila winning.  If that’s how things turn it most likely won’t play out as some ground-up Turner Diaries revolt, ala WN 1.0 &amp; 2A LARPers. It will be class-traitors within their own ranks who see the chance to circulate the elites.  I’d rather be separate from the whole shitshow by then, although we’ll need guys inside to play the situation to our semi-external advantage.

                    Readers can look at Andrew Joyce’s pieces at The Occidental Observer, Guyenot’s books and articles at Unz Review, and a few dozen other sources referenced therein.
You’re not going to bog me down with Talmudry over how many goyim are dancing on the heads of which pins – it’s Saturday and some of us work on weekends.

                        Your reply is hearsay about hearsay.  There are also articles about Christian blood used in Passover matzoh. It’s called blood libel.

                                Not only allowed but have a clear understanding that it might be the only way for people to survive as a nation. White American Christians have provided a best shelter to the Jews in the 2000 yrs history of exile.If it does not work for one side any longer a dialog should be started about problems. Hard to see that dialog proceding in any civilised fashion in the present political atmosphere.By the way one of the reason of hatred toward Israel (besides usual anti-semitism) is inability to force them to open their borders like Europe and America under Obama did.

                                        Not would but did. Most of Russian Jews, including myself, who joined major Jewish organizations left them. Majority of these organizations  pander to questionable Muslims and call it “diplomacy”.Israelis and American Jews are becoming 2 different nations with the majority of Russian-American Jews being on the side of Israelis.Trump’s approval rating in Israel is 80-90%.Of course long Jewish history saw such splits quite a few times before.Old Testament will tell you so.

            What happened in your family happens large scale to any revolutionary movement.Different factions will join forces against a common enemy.  Once they vanquish their enemy, they’ll turn on each other.  The French Revolution, the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany and the Iranian theocracy come to mind.  Even early Christianity was a revolutionary movement that after it gained sufficient power in the Roman Empire persecuted first pagans and finally heretics.There are two ideas that unite the Left and the Democratic Party:  They’re  warring tribes in the common pursuit of plunder and hatred of Whites. In the absence of Whites, they’ll turn on each other.

        It was chilling to see the Cubs fan at Wrigley Field receive a lifetime ban earlier this season.  While Doug Granville, a black man was reporting next to the stands, a fan behind him flashed the OK sign with his fingers. Cubs ownership assumed his gesture meant “white supremacy,” not something like the “circle game,” or simply “A-Okay.” They acted swiftly and decisively and gave those of us paying attention a glimpse into what’s coming next.

            The Cubs ownership is closely tied with GOP politics, one of them is the current Governor of Nebraska. There was a scandal earlier this year when we found out that one of the family is a realtalker.
So they do this to cover their ass. The franchise wants the city to cough up money for renovations, and as the team of the white-collar North side, they run the very real risk of an SJW boycott.

MLB also banned a backup catcher for speaking against Black Lives Matter.
They did nothing much there because Muslims aren’t as powerful as Jews are in this country.

        The (very pozzed) Atlantic magazine published an interesting article about “woke” culture.  It came out last October, and is titled “Americans Strongly Dislike PC Culture”.  Ignoring for a moment that huge numbers of people vote for PC culture, the author breaks down what people really think.  What was found was that the Progressive thing, what the author labels as “progressive activists”, constitute 8% of the population.  Moreover, most of them are white, highly educated, and make a lot of money.  Very few are of color.  The other 92%, running the range from traditional liberal and all the way from there, universally hate political correctness and the inability to freely speak, associate, or act without being called out on it, often unexpectedly from unintentional insults.  The problem is that the proggies infest government, education, the media, and corporate leadership and upper management.  Those are all the places staffed by the highly educated whites, who make a lot of money.  This is 8% of the population, that’s all.  What we are doing is fighting a battle with public perception that this stuff is universal, and a second battle directly against the nodes of power that have been invaded by this poisonous minority.  Racial minorities, for example, have no say or play in the game, other than to get the low end job and economic handout gibs that this minority offers to them.  All the proggie blather is not about lifting anyone up, it is about protecting the gigs of the rich white woke people, the 8%, who protect their sinecures by posturing as people who understand this hidden language and human meaning that the rest of us don’t, and position themselves at the head of every line, because they are special people.  That’s why they get to fly private jets to meetings, called to tell the rest of us to take a train.  There is no contradiction in their minds.  We need to call out the 8% as just that, “the 8%”.  People need to see that we are overlorded by a tiny minority of people.  Once normies realize that so much of the cultural strife and rot is brought to us by such a circumscribed small group of white, overpaid, overfed pansies, we can make a bigger dent in public perception.

            Excellent analysis.
And this particular demographic goes out of it’s way to hide itself to how you put it make us believe the Poz is brought on by the public at large when it isn’t.
One thing is for sure, the 8% will have to be dealt with if we ever hope to have a sane and healthy country.

You know… rich jewish woke people who protect their sinecures and have invaded all the key nodes of power.The Atlantic article insists that we all understand this culpable minority is privileged White people.

                Lars, I think you are falling into a trap of a different sort.  Around this joint, we define Jews as something other than white.  The broader culture does not, in part, due to unwitting support of their protective coloration. I am taking a blind guess that many, if not most, of American Jews fall into that 8% group, but they are not the only ones.  It doesn’t really matter if the part of the 8% destroying your community is Jewish, atheist, Christian, or, say, Baha’i.  Calling out subsets of the 8% is a sort of “look, a squirrel”.  The broader point I am making is that the 8% is, in itself, a self-interest group that crosses color and gender lines, but shares a vested interest in maintaining its status and wealth through speaking its own language and propagating its own world view, and using that language and outlook to figuratively (and occasionally physically) bash us over the heads with it.  That a significant part of the 8% is Jewish is undoubtedly true, and that they are using traditionally Jewish tactics appears obvious as well.  But we need to draw a line around these people from a broader standpoint of shared beliefs, not a narrower ethnic tribal one.  In drawing a line around all of them, the 8% is seen as the minority that it is, that the occasional black or Christian is not a straw man to hide behind, and that we are calling them out for how they think, what they believe, and how they treat the rest of us, whatever God they pray to, if any.That said, in writing my first post, the things you point out were sort of jumping off the page at me, too.

        Unfortunately, the Devil in this new religion is an actual living group of people, namely,us.It’s going to get to the point where white people are going to have to cultivate something like the Islamic concept of “taqiya” (dissimulation, lying), whereby your group has moral license to lie to outsiders. Then we can give lip service to the totalitarian left-wing religion if necessary to stay employed, but still keep the truth clear in our own minds and with a clear conscience.Of course, that will take a very clear sense of our own identity.Unfortunately, a lot of weak-minded white people have no psychological or spiritual resources to resist the onslaught of white-hating globohomo, and tragically end up as self-hating NPCs, spiritually murdered people lost to themselves and history because of this malicious Bolshevik religion.

                New action Bolsheviks they are!  My parents were Trots up through the 50’s. Since the Commie Revolution, Commies learned how to shape shift the look of original communism and shape shift the language….continuously.  This is not the Communism of my daddy. But it is the dogged determination of commies that then took it to the Frankfurt School and the familiar names of such, on and on up through Alinsky, who gave birth to The Hildabeast and Hussein O.Not to mention Marxism all around the globe became Local i.e. African Marxism, Central and South American Marxism, South Asian and dozens more.  The Globalists oozed out of these Western and Soviet commie schools of thought. And so did Environmentalism…..Green on the Outside; Red on the Inside. The tentacles of early communism have spread and morphed into all these forms of tyranny. And commies will gaslight with disdain and say this isn’t communism… only unsophisticated dummies see this as communism. And most commies don’t carry cards. All these different breeds of parent communism have this in common…an absolute fanatical determination to issue in utopia, hopefully in their time. THEY NEVER SLOW THE PACE…THEY NEVER GIVE UP.  FORWARD!  And those of us on the other side of the divide just want to enjoy our families and do life. The juggernaut of the new action Left rolls on and on over us ….they won’t stop!

                    Secular ideology really does take the place of religion (poorly) for those who give up reaching inside and outside themselves for more.Their willingness to constantly push for change, two steps forward, is why they win in any battle against cons &amp; “tactical libertarians.”  The anti-leftists always start with the status quo as their opening offer in any cultural negotiation, with a bottom line of one step back, calling the final result a “victory” merely because the left only notched the needle one more peg toward Babylon.FWIW, I think there’s an important place for environmentalism (think conservation, hunters &amp; fishermen, not AGW hoodoo) in Our Thing.  Properly framed, it’s the scientific position as well as a huge gateway for recruiting true believers from the enemy’s left.  Browns demonstrably DGAF about the environment and India &amp; China will never play ball on the AGW hokum.  As Queen Anne said, the white plastic bag may as well be Mexico’s national flower.

        It was a major blackpill when I saw the Boomercons fly into rage about Kapernick, and then fall victim to both a short attention span and utter hypocrisy. Indeed, if I had a dollar for everyone that said “I’m boycotting the NFL and watching NCAA”. It also wasn’t reported much that just as the owners paid off Kapernick, they also paid off Trump to get him to stop supporting boycotts. Or maybe they just stroked his ego. More importantly, Congress was debating an end to tax-exempt stadium bonds, and then it was deleted from the final bill.

            There’s also a recent boomlet of the NCAA players now demanding payment. Indeed, this is after the fact that full-ride scholarships for the barely literate are not treated as taxable income. And lets not forget the issue of sexual access, perhaps sexual assault.
The NCAA itself is tax-exempt, which should be called into question. Remarkably, only a few athletic departments manage to turn a profit even though they can receive tax-deductible donations. Indeed we need to probably get rid of college athletics altogether, or else restrict it to the no-scholarships Ivy League model.

                In Canada, promising hockey players are drafted at 16 into a professional Junior League, where they are paid a small salary and are subject to being traded/waived/etc.  They have academic responsibilities, but this “student athlete” nonsense isn’t really a thing.
There’s also certain demographic differences that you can probably guess.

                A bit late, but look in this twtr thread, its all these blacks complaining that “white coaches and administrators” are making money by oppressing the poor black athletes. I wish I could show so many Boomer conservatives how much these athletes and their alma mater hate them. Stop donating. Turn off the television.

                The beginning of the end of my sports fandom was LeBron James calling Clevelanders racist when he left to play in Miami. In the process of leaving, he strong-armed the franchise into firing the coach and front office, lest he not re-sign. Which of course he was never planning to do. That’s called collusion, and its actionable. I suspect the NBA later rigged the draft as backdoor compensation.So when he came back, it never meant the same to me, of course I was a political dissident by then which certainly colored my expectations. And once he was gone again, he went back to his anti-white schtick.

            Here’s a radical idea:
How about stop watching sports ENTIRELY.
Take the time you now suddenly have and go down to the gun range, read more books on warfare tactics……..  anything but watching completely overpaid grown men playing children’s games.
Too much too soon?

                I stopped watching sports completely around 2001. A game has been on TV when I was at a family gathering such as Thanksgiving, but I did not watch it. I could not even name a player on any team pro or college.
Once upon a time I was a huge fan. Go Dolphins! Now? Piss on all of them.

                I said this here once before but breaking white men away from pro sports is probably the biggest single thing we could do to build a white identity. Sports creates a phony solidarity for one thing. I see this on display at a seedy factory I visit for work sometimes. Their workforce is mostly Mestizos, probably of questionable VISA status. There are still some white guys too though. There’s a TV in the cafeteria and when the game is on I see them all, whites and their replacements alike, quietly worshiping the electric Ju. If I bought into all that racial harmony and diversity shit it would be heartwarming.Making pro sports even more of a minority thing than it is also creates opportunities for hilarious chimpouts and other displays of vibrancy at games that will make great 60 second video spots and do more to red pill whites than a week reading our posts here.

        “Passivity will not be tolerated.”
I think that’s an underrated point. Going all the way back at least to Henry VIII, the intent was not merely to make you shut up with your speaking, it was to make you positively assent to things you might not believe. It wasn’t good enough for Thomas More to say, “Look, I’ll keep my mouth shut on who your wife is.” No, he had to positively say he agreed with the king when he did not.
He couldn’t bring himself to do it. The vast majority could.

        Z sets the Objectivist devil in my gut rumbling with the concepts of a “servile” or a “custodial” state.  She’s still in there, down deep – the habits of 3 decades are hard to unlearn.“Today, your employer believes they own the whole you, even the parts of your life outside of your work.”Contra libertarians, the only way to prevent this total patrician dominance of proles is to use collective prole-power and influence against the employers, but after decades of Red-Blue, many of us on the Right are still unable to conceive of collective action as anything but evil.My old beloved Tea Party idea of government “leaving people alone to run muh business” was never realistic under any serious scrutiny. There are obviously degrees and means of control to be debated, but the lassez-faire state we were sold as an ideal was never anything but a naked power play by the Kochtopus and its fellow corporate krakens.The kind of market I fanstasized about exists only at a sub-corporate scale and can only be maintained by active “extra-economic” intervention.Infinity Browns asserting a Trojan Horse “right to work” for Chinese wages no longer looks preferable to the old system of featherbedding and bribery – see the Rust Belt &amp; Old South vs. today.  We need to re-learn the art of collective action, from past labor, union and guild efforts – both where they went right and wrong.First things – if we get the biology and culture of the collective right, the problems of collective organization and corruption become a lot more manageable. Ethnic division was one way the old school unions were corrupted. As Amazon recently demonstrated, the best way to break a strike of Somolians was to hire a bunch of Mexicans, rendering collective action by labor impossible.The next step is to humanize the scale of business, closer to the Amish than to Wal-Mart. Z’s talked about this re: the small contractors that used to form the backbone of the tech industry around Lagos &amp; elsewhere in America.  But that’s a 201-level post for another day.

            Libertarianism and liberalism add up to a sort of political eunuchism, whose central tenet is, “no matter what they do to you, don’t fight back.”
Not only do we have to fight back, we have tosmash downthe evil people doing these things. Otherwise we’re going to be up against the wall–figuratively then literally.

                The FTN guys call this “tactical libertarianism.”  It’s deployed by the intellectual interference-runners like French &amp; Shapiro to lock you into defense mode.  “Leave us alone, hands-off” is not an agenda.  The side pushing a positive agenda always wins at least incrementally in that fight because laissez-faires never look to gain ground.  Z’s citation of “positive obligations” today is very important.  A truly symbiotic relationship between rulers and ruled requires the elites to deliver positive good for the proles, not just a “level playing field,” because our internal and external competition is playing to win, not stay even.

                “no matter what they do to you, don’t fight back.”
That was certainly not the way of Rothbard or the rest of us. Right wing populism goes hand in hand with “I hate the State in all it incarnations”.
You must be talking about the “beltway libertarians” who are about as useful as the “Conservatives”. Cucks all.

        A culture is often thought to be balanced and stable when labor, business, and state are in moral lockstep, when they share a common religion.  But that’s not the case, because what if those morals agitate against reality, natural law, and “Providence?”  To my mind, it all depends on the prevailing worldview on which cultural morals are based.  The humanist religion, prevalent since the late-19th century, doesn’t have a great track record in bringing peace and justice to its people, or even espousing an intelligible rationale for peace and justice.  Morals make absolutely no sense in a mechanistic, naturalist religion of scientismWhen you have a people with a distorted worldview, and thus distorted morals, then you’re looking at a people that roll into the fetal position as their custodial state grows ever more despotic.  And here we are.

        “Passivity will not be tolerated.”  I was required to attend a 2 hour “Diversity and Inclusion” training session at work recently.  While we were “encouraged to participate” in discussions it wasn’t required.
It’s easy to imagine that the next time I am forced to attend, the training will include, “List the 5 actions you have taken to promote diversity or dismantle white privilege,” and you will be graded on the enthusiasm of your response.

The only way any actual competition can exist, much lest manifest benefits,  or Hayek’s infamous “knowledge problem” can be mitigated, is to decentralize and localize interests.

        The Dune novels present a similar analog to the emerging custodial state. Absolute power corrupts absolutely, and the tech giants are only too happy to facilitate the transition to the Brave New World. Their biggest fear is an armed revolt, and they are desperately looking for a politically feasible way to implement firearm confiscation as a preemptive remedy. But that is a fools errand. The next revolution will be fought with technology and stealth, not armed confrontation. It won’t be the mob that gets you, it will be the invisible shiv.

            Dune’s tripolar system of Empire, Guild &amp; Sisterhood (Khash, Vaish &amp; Brahms) was a good Campbell-scale take society’s persistent patterns.  Even now, we have Military/Deep State/LEO’s, Wall Street &amp; Cathedral.You’re on the money re: revolution.  Truly ground-up national scale revos are unheard of, and the real levers of influence and power in our Empire are so centralized now that I don’t see mass-scale public involvement with any major power-shift.  When the long knives come out, it will be Soviet-style, and we’ll only hear the New Bosses’ sanitized moralized version of the events afterward via the Cathedral they control.  I’d like some distance between Our Guys and the Empire by then and some strategic options to exercise.

            I don’t think you are right that firearms wouldn’t play a crucial part. Certainly such a conflict in the US would look very different from those in the past and the fictionalized imagery we have from past writers and movie-makers. Technology does and will play a large part, though perhaps more so in the early stages. But while modern man might be terrified by de-platforming and de-personing, I’m sure that the aversion to loss of one’s life is still more powerful, once the fog arising of post-modern delusion and cosseted Western  life-cycle is stripped away.

                Firearms are vital for self defense (and subsistence hunting) during the chaos of the Brave New World, but not really that useful as a tool to defeat tyranny. Once upon a time, tyrants could hide effectively behind castle walls and a personal guard of mercenary thugs. But technology is a two-way street, and since tyrants have chosen to weaponize it against the innocent, what goes around comes around.

                            In a better time it would be a perfect stadium, still my favorite venue in SoCal.  We’ll have to work a meet-up there sometime &amp; edge-post the normies.  The surrounding area isn’t Hollyweird-tier pozzed but still plenty to mock there over muh drank after the Madres lose 3-0 as usual. For extra Lagos flava, catch them when muh Dodgers are doing one of their seasonal drive-by’s.

        “The Chinese communists are far too practical to worry about the spiritual well-being of their people. They do worry about their social cohesion, especially in difficult times.”
The more our “spiritual guides” stick it to YT the less social cohesion they will get…yes, many will bend the knee but enough won’t.
There’s no pot of gold at the end of the diversity rainbow. The custodial state is held together by gadgets and weak men.

            Every major national or international law firm in the US has also adopted this model. If you want to make partner and progress in your career as a partner you must be actively supporting and promoting the firm’s diversity agenda. A vote against handing partnership to a woman, open homosexual, or a non-Asian minority is a career-ending move. If you’re a good attorney with a good book of business you’ll be allowed to stay, but will go no farther up the ladder. If you’re without your own book of business you’ll be out in a year or two.

                Perhaps, but why would a law firm vote in a partner who did not produce $$$ for the firm.  Or at least vote more than a token of such folk.  Every dollar they take is one less in the pot to distribute among the productive?

                    Because the Borg demands it. If your firm does not have strong and consistently improving improving diversity numbers every year you will not be allowed to bid for work from federal, state, or many governments, DoD contractors, and most Fortune 100 companies. Diversity compliance audits, you know.

        Today, the spiritual is the domain of corporate giants. So-called “woke capital” is an effort to impose an official morality on the public. … Woke capital not only has economic and legal duties. It has spiritual duties, as well.I’ve done some traveling lately, and this is precisely one of the things I’ve noticed. Hotels take advantage of their captive audience (you can’t switch off the signs they post) to preach virtue. Save the earth by reusing your towels. See those two separate compartments in the (tiny) wastebaskets in your room? Recycle! Turn off the lights when you leave the room and if you don’t, we’ll do it for you through automation.Free “news” — stacks ofUSA Todayin the lobby, CNN on the TV in public areas on the rare occasions when no sportsball is available.In the wider world, we’ve all noticed the alternative universe inhabited by advertising and TV shows. Biracial couples, mulatto kids, they’re here, get used to it. Ghey and sapphic couples, don’t even think of finding anything objectionable. Trannies are a Trend, and the Trend is your friend. Blacks at least 50 percent of anything you see on the screen, black models dominating print ads.Business has always had a manipulative side, but until recent years it was mainly about “hidden persuasion” to induce you to buy their products. That aside, corporations didn’t tell you how to live. Now it’s a new kind of totalitarian state where the power establishment decides the winners and losers of the economy, and the corporate world falls into line to please its masters by spreading the politically correct gospel.As usual, I can see the problem better than I can see a way to fight back. I hope others more imaginative than I have useful ideas.

        There’s nothing new about this system, except for it to work, the managerial elite can’t hate the people they manage.  What’s been happening over the last 20 years is an active hatred of the unwashed masses.  Today it’s vaping.  Those stupid beasts of the field are ruining their lungs, so we need a set of complex regulations surrounding glycol based products.  And they’ll do it, complete with taxes.  If you follow the money the “public interest” lobbies, taken together are a vast industry.  With the new vaping regulations, you will then need a set of consultants, making hundreds of dollars an hour, to usher your business through the labyrinth.  The media is fully culpable in all of this, as usual.  When you peel away the morality police you’ll find a complex asset stripping operation of the country.Look at MADD for instance.  In many states you have to take a class and give them a check for the privilege of your post DUI morality training.  That class where you learn that drinking is bad and that you could kill someone on the road.  You have no choice in the matter. it’s part of your probation.  For MADD it became about the money decades ago.  Yes, in 1980 it was about bitter middle aged women who were upset that their precious Johnny or Heather died on the road in a flipped Jeep because of demon rum.  After all the ribbons were tied, it was turned into a grift run by extremists, like all the others.  We have de-facto government by finger wagging nags, so who better to assume power than Elizabeth Warren, the future nag in chief?Let’s hope that half way through the Warren presidency that the country, impoverished and fed up, just wants to rebel against all of this, let its hair down, have that line of flask of whiskey when driving.  We need an era where people look at these grifters and say “who the hell are you anyway to tell me how to live?”

            Come on, JR. Anyone who actually drives while intoxicated is grossly irresponsible. They shouldn’t have to pay MADD as part of their sentence, but they need to be corrected in no uncertain terms.
I don’t know anything about vaping (never tried it) and maybe the anti-vaping campaign is another virtue crusade. Still society ought to be cautious about this kick until scientific evidence builds.
Your first paragraph hits the mark.

                MADD cares about drunk driving the way Planned Parenthood cares about “women’s health.”  I’m not saying it’s good to swerve and hit people on the road, although the movie Cannonball isn’t that bad.  I’m saying that most of these goodie-two-shoes organizations, many now a half century or a century old, are morally bankrupt cash registers for a crowd of people and need to be called out in a big way.As far as vaping, if glycol killed people we would have known it decades ago.  A teenager buys some seedy Chinese vaping product in Chinatown, scars his lungs, and now all the world has a vaping crisis.

                    MADD is now just a bunch of modern day Prohibitionists attached to a modern cause to give their empty lives meaning.  I suspect the leaders have some monetary interest as well.Every year, in every State, they push for lower and lower BAC’s for presumptive DUI arrests.  Here the latest push is for .06 or .04 on the breathalyzer.  This would make most folk liable to arrest with a single beer imbibed.  Most accidents however involve folk exceeding this level by two to three times!Indeed, after every holiday, they publish the stat’s wrt to folks who are caught up in the road side pull over dragnets they love to organize.  Although they don’t break down specifically by BAC, they do publish the number of citations/arrests for “felony” DUI (.14 or above or second DUI arrest).Overwhelming majority are for felony DUI type infraction.  In other words, the drinkers we need to watch out for are never deterred by the BAC in effect, they drink their fill and drive no matter what—while the simp’s who get pulled over and confess to their two beers at the local restaurant get cited—without need to show impairment on the part of the officer.BTW, in this State it is *not* illegal to drink/consume alcohol and drive.  It is illegal to drive to the “slightest degree” of impairment should you imbibe.  And in their lies the reason for implied impairment via BAC testing.

                He didn’t say anything about not punishing drunk drivers, just that they shouldn’t have to pay tribute to a bunch of rent-seeking harpies.
If we really wanted to cut down on drunk driving we could build walkable cities instead of suburban hellscapes and require bars to breathalyze customers before they leave the premises (inb4 “muh personal responsibility”)
I agree wrt vaping though. Those products were promoted as a safer alternative to smoking as soon as they were invented. If I were interested in vaping, I’d want to see some longitudinal studies first.

            MADD and other activist groups, NGOs and the like didn’t spring up nowhere and acquire the power they have all on their own. There was no coup d’eta, no active revolution by force. They had the support of the political establishment which in turn was supported by their constituents. So in the end, it was the majority of we the people who either actively supported these things or passively supported it by not taking a stand.Dissidents are a marginalized minority viewed as fools by the peasant majority. Nobody imposed the managerial/custodial state on us, it was by the consent and even full throated support of our fellow citizens, not one particular generation but several starting in the early 20th century.As to the impoverished rising up, highly unlikely in the next election cycle. It’s quintessential to the nature of the masses not to want freedom but to be led. They want a master and betters to tell them how to live properly. They’re too scared to go through life without their mother goddess, the custodial state to watch over them and make sure life is “fair” and they’re protected from their own bad decisions.  After 87 years of big gubbermint is my friend and takes care of me, the cult of government taking action. The do something, do anything style of rule started by cult of personality president for life Franklin Darth Roosevelt, the proles think this is how the world is supposed to operate and can’t imagine anything else. Long live the New Deal!Just as the masses will now trumpet their support ever louder for whatever politically correct hoops they have to jump through, whatever new self-flagellation is necessary to please their betters so to keep whatever food and material comfort or standard of living they still have from decreasing even more. They hope to please master so he let’s them keep what they have and as master only punishes bad people so they will try harder to be good. So the majority of our fellow YT citizens either like being slaves or believe it’s better and wiser to go along to get along. Just as they did during the Obama administration and the rise of woke capital and woke scolds.

                    What subversion?Pardon this off topic digression.                                                                                     Everything that grandfatherly old huckster and his brain trust did, they did out in full view of the public and lambasting all critics as servants of the plutocrats who not only created the depression but for some reason wanted the depression to continue. These contemporary critics of presidential and executive branch overreach  included H.L. Mencken, Garet Garrett and even former gov. of NY, Al Smith among others. And the critics were heard through newspapers and magazines across the country. But the majority of proles couldn’t get enough of their Glorious Leader making them feel better with his fireside chats.Cooperation with the president and all his schemes was sold as being a “good American” and who didn’t want to be a good American.Still, how could anyone not see federal alphabet agencies springing up like mushrooms with new rafts of regulations including price controls, the federal deficit and debt expanding? How could they not notice for example a presidential diktat ordering Americans to turn in their gold and forbidding ownership of gold. Was that even legal or constitutional?But heck, FDR is our leader and he promised happy days are here again and we’re at war with the depression and if we give him more power, Lord FDR will lead us to the promised land of economic prosperity. The peasantry got the strong master they yearned for who claimed he cared about his serfs and told them their bosses were scumbags. Even if their master’s policies were prolonging the depression, FDR felt their pain and that’s all that mattered.

                        Fair points. But given the mood of the country at the time and the ravages of the Depression, it’s possible that FDR’s federal government interventionism prevented a full-strength socialist turn.

        O/t : Guns of September?Just reading the reporting on this dronestrike against the House of Saud’s oil infrastructure.  Big if true.Real big.The Shia Houthi have been hitting Saudi Arabia with drones provided by Iran for the past four or five months.  For the past six weeks or so, a few people who are supposed to know about war have been saying that the Kingdom has lost this one.Which means that Mohammad bin Salman, the man who would be king, has a disaster on his hands.  From my window, the best path forward for the Saudis is a humiliating cease-fire.  I wonder what the view is from his.  Or Netanyahu’s.Regionally, the initiative remains with the Shia generally, the Iranians in particular, and their Russian collaborators.  Globally, it still seems to seesaw back-and-forth between an emerging bloc centered loosely in Eurasia on the one hand and on the other a divided, leaderless and faltering ‘west’ composed of corrupt aging republics and hapless constitutional monarchies.The Anglo-Zionist grand strategy has failed spectacularly.  Everyone sees this.  There is an intellectual vacuum and we need to start filling this by presenting new ideas about what our foreign policy should look like going forward.

        To add a moment in this process.When the US enacted the 1964 Civil Rights Act it solidified the transformation of the State into the State-as-Church. The Federal Government claimed ownership and control of what has clearly become the lodestone and foundational moral matter: anti-discrimination, first and continuingly most dominantly on race, and then to the downstream identities of gender, sexuality,  sexual identity, disability, migrant status, etc.With the exception of some increasingly half-hearted and insignificant foot dragging by the Catholic Church on abortion, all the Christian Churches have become voluntary vassals to the new Papacy in Washington. Once which, by the way, puts the antics of its Renaissance predecessor to shame.

        Not only will we have to stand for the Anthem of Wokeness, but we will also be monitored to make sure we are singing, too.
Enthusiastically.

        Zman’s prescience is spooky. One of the websites that I routinely visit was de-platformed last night in the middle of a session. Me thinks the beast is getting a little anxious.

        Right on the mark!  And the “spiritual” overlay is clearly based on secular humanism and civic nationalism, obviously meant to supplant the organic spiritual traditions of nations in favor of those that support the transnational oligarchy of “wokedom.”

        All of these ambitious plans will require coordination and control at a level which is not sustainable, or even possible.  Since it doesn’t appear that many are willing to take up the gun, or do much of anything at all, the best option is to disengage.

        Your very life could depend on proper wokeness. See the WSJ op-ed (paywall) from September 12, “Take Two Aspirin and Call Me by My Pronouns”
Also the New England Journal of Medicine “Perspectives.”
Not only do the Frenchies not see that, as in the Middle Ages, the Church ruled alongside the state, but also that the new church of the woke religion, the corporation, is perfectly capable of turning over heretics to the “secular arm” for punishment.

        Think most people just pay lip service to political correctness.  One enterprising  minority working at a government building had a large number of cheap one page calendars printed out when the first black family moved into the Oval Office.Clearly it only cost a dollar or two to make them, but she went around selling them for $10 a piece.  It became a running joke because they were plastered all over the building.Buy one or else !  :-bThere’s a groundswell of opposition against the propaganda.  The election of President Trump has scared the crap out of them.Hence the coming firearm confiscation.P,S.   The site has been running unusually slow ( at least for me )

        Somewhat OT:  A news site I visit had a promoted link to the AARP with a picture of a confused looking older lady and the caption:
OLDER PEOPLE OFTEN DON’T RECOGNIZE SEXUAL HARASSMENT
I really don’t get how there can be unrecognized sexual harassment. Isn’t that sort of like unfelt shame?

        and so descends the Zman, into the fever swamps.  which I applaud.  you will be the new Faulkner of the anti-system.so what happens once the U.S. goes full totalitarian?    all of a sudden we are now best buds with the Eu+Russia, and the PRC?  Or is that a maximally unstable arrangement of power?  these systems are always parasitic; without a host, what happens?   like a flea without a dog, they wither and die.   just like venezuela is doing.the only question i would like answered, is will the new Borg tolerate pockets of free living people; in the mountains and so forth.  you wouldn’t have title to anything out there, but you could easily squat out beyond Skynet coverage.

        Take a look around you. Not pretty is it?We have been headed to where we are at in the US since the very beginning. When the Articles of Confederation was overturned in the first coup, we got the Constitution which was designed for an Empire. Subtle, but the power was inherent in it all along to crush the unwashed masses.Some idiots on the right blame everything bad on the Boomers. Others blame Jews. Others blame Russia. There has never been a State that did not become ever more overbearing as it grew and gained strength. The real enemy is right there in plain sight.1984 is a book you should read several times. That book describes the way large, strong States behave.

            The ruling document is influential but not decisive.  It’s the people who inhabit the country.  There is no more important decision than deciding who gets to live in your country.  We Americans were naive and inattentive.
