        I abandoned NRO &amp; NR print after they threw Derbyshire over the side.
I stopped supporting Heritage after they threw Jason Richwine and his report under the bus.
I stopped watching Fox and canceled my cable after even O’Reilly continued to use Trayvon’s Jr High School picture, even though his current &amp; more revealing twitter photos were easily available on the web.
On Z’s recommendation, I went back and looked at KW on NRO.
Like the above poster, I don’t see much of interest there. Just the usual squid ink.I don’t get Z’s interest in him.

        I’ve read KW on NRO for almost a year and I still don’t have much of an idea what he represents. I guess he’s a libertarian but  he’s all over the map. You think you know him and then he writes something that makes you go ‘huh?’. NRO may seem bad but it was that way by design. It’s just the mainstream GOP talking points in editorial form. They found a niche of ppl that want that stuff.
