        Williams was charged with obstruction of justice.  At first, I thought his arrest was a violation of his First Amendment rights.  On second thought, I concluded maybe the police did have grounds for charging him.  If a person schemes with a criminal or witness to a crime in such a way as to hinder the investigation or prosecution of a crime,  that is definitely obstruction, no two ways about it.  In this case, Williams knew exactly what his “students” were trying to do because they told him.  Suppose, however, the undercover agents hadn’t told him why they wanted the training.  Would that have been obstruction?  I don’t think so, not as long as he wasn’t conspiring with or aiding someone he knew to be under investigation or indictment.  Williams error in this case (one of official entrapment) was knowing that what his “students” planned to do with their training was illegal.   Instead, he should have offered the training with “no questions asked.”

        The original idea of Robert Peel was to create a public service of people authorised to make the arrest of another citizen on suspicion of committing crime. To this end the ‘Peelers’ were lightly armed and entirely subject to the law of the land; there was no exceptionality.That’s why to this day UK cops are (mostly) unarmed though once more the spectre of islam and its holy-book-sanctioned violence has persuaded the powers here to have more unarmed cops to be in the reach of squads of trained weapons officers. Oh, and the IRA is still active, despite repeated shallow efforts to make their thugs welcome in society.The problem however is that unarmed cops still have ‘powers’ and the desire by some of them to set the tone if not the letter of the law is worrying. The fact that policemen can tell citizens in public places not to take photographs when there is no British law that says that is one of the things a lot of people are uncomfortable about.Britain has, some say, more surveillance cameras than any other country which — in the nature of the beast — clearly shows what law-abiding citizens are doing rather than finding the law-breakers. In one UK town CCTV cameras were used to ‘track’ a family who had applied legitimately for their child to go to a different school reveals how the power can be misused. Apparently the CCTV operators, who are not police, used the word ‘Targets’ when the family left their home and reported their movements to the local school board.It isn’t just the police it would seem that people here have to worry about.

        The “police problem” started with DUI checkpoints fueled by asset forfeiture. Both illegal scams that blur the line between law and lawbreaking.

        Here is part of Penn &amp; Teller’s take on lie detectors as complete bullshit. Judging from this, I don’t think there’s much to “beat”.
The whole show used to be available, but now only this shortened segment, apparently.
