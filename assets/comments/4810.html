        I think one thing you will find, post-Obumble, is that he will be venerated because he won elections. If — and I admit I think this long shot — the Republicans (or even third party) get their act together and win the next two elections, say. there will be fond memories of what the Man Allegedly From Africa achieved.We have the same thing here. Tony Bliar may be despised since he left office but there is a grudging admiration on the left that he did what Brown and Miliband couldn’t do: he actually stood and won. In the great game of political power, being able to first win and subsequently hold office is pretty much the best badge you can get.

        FDR was quite senile at the end also. Marshall didn’t even try to spin it otherwise.

        […] crazy, because it seems like I’m one of the few people who sees this.  Z Man points out just today that modern liberalism has nothing to do with politics.  It’s a cult, full […]

        He will never go away-he needs adoration too much even if it’s from sycophants. You think Carter was bad? He is going to be sticking his nose into everything.

        Moonbattery is an interesting condition. The Moonbats I know (and where I live, in a northeastern latte town, I know plenty) usually have no conception of what right wingers think- and by right wingers I guess I mean everyone from us dissident -right types to Conservative, Inc neocons. They lump us all together, and have no real answers to anything other than, I guess, “more government control of everything.” As for Barry-O I think he’s predisposed toward moonbattery, but I think at heart he’s just a hack. Hacks want money- he’ll be happy with money (it would, of course, have to be way more money than the average hack is satisfied with) and Michelle will be happy to live the life of Mrs Hack. Barry will also give speeches for big bucks to adoring crowds- they’ll pay for his membership at Winged Foot or some such place.

        I could be wrong, but maybe he will lose relevancy post White House..  Maybe everyone has heard enough of his blather and will begin to see him as the empty suit he is.  Oh sure, for a while, the faithful will grant alms but without another accomplishment ie. “first black president”,  he might just fade away to all but the faithful.  Naw, the idiots will keep him and mooch afloat for quite a while. He might be like Sharpton/Jackson and go on forever. Sigh.

            He will be perfectly happy being the figurehead of his cult. As long as not much is requires and the checks roll in, he will be okay with that.If we are lucky we can look forward to at least three more autobiographies written by Bill Ayers.

        It’s the religion of the people who hate religion, and who obviously don’t get irony. They love Islam, but Islam is not a religion. It’s a police state in the guise of a religion, and if there’s anything the Cult loves it’s a police state. They only wish they could have one here.
