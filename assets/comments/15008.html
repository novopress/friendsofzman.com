            Yep. Again‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a teacher in inner city Chicago.  I live in a 23 story apartment building.
Come in the waters warm. People are people. Some suck. Most are awesome when you get to know them.
The answer isn‚Äôt segregation. It‚Äôs letting go of fear.

                You sound like an NEA, SEIU mind numb robot.
As a teacher, please endeavor to learn about apostrophes and the overuse of cliches.

            So segregation?
Fought and won already.
Maybe the answer is getting out of our bubbles and actually talking to people.  It‚Äôs hard (and scary) but it can work if people are brave and loose their prejudice.

        Sorry to be a downer‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not understanding what you‚Äôre purpose for this article is.  Question for you Zman: What should be done about Black Crime?  I live in Chicago and a ton of good Black people live in these neighborhoods.  What‚Äôs your solution?  If it‚Äôs not evil progressive solutions like better education or work programs what‚Äôs the answer?A magical White Ethno State where all the poor misunderstood White Males can congregated?Whether we like it or not we are Americans. Violence in the inner city is an American problem just like opiods ravaging the rural communities.Just tired of people feeling so ‚Äúbrave‚Äù as to say ‚ÄúBlacks commit a lot of crime.‚Äù  Yep. Everyone knows that. Whats the answer?Lazy article that appeals to the Alt Right who have no answers just hatred.And yes‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a Jew, a Libtard, a whatever. Now what‚Äôs the answer?

        There was something kinda interesting.  Derbs was saying for some reason US born Hispanics have higher crime rates than fresh off the boat(or rio grande ferry lol).  He didn‚Äôt know why but I thought I had a good hypothesis.  The ones who come here are older or at least of varying age.  Most crime is committed by young males, so by definition we are missing the peak crime years of the Hispanics born in Mexico.  In other words the crime rate of Hispanics born in the  states is more likely to reflect their true crime rate.  Good?

            Your hypothesis regarding age and ‚Äúpeak criminality‚Äù seems to make sense. I‚Äôd add another (which admittedly is probably a secondary effect). Victimhood. Back home in their country of origin our New American may or may not have been from a lower (discriminated against, vicitmized, whatever) class, but if he was, it was just part of the order of things. Those in power were convinced that as a member of a lower order, he had it coming. In short, no one gave a shit about his plight.Now in the US our New American friends are constantly told that they are in fact VICTIMS, and society at large, and whitey in particular, OWES them. So the bar to unlawful behavior and actions is dramatically lowered. It‚Äôs no longer a matter of deciding to become a criminal, it‚Äôs ‚Äúgetting revenge‚Äù or ‚Äúgetting some of my own back‚Äù or ‚Äúinformal reparations‚Äù. Whatever you call it, the toxic ideology is the same.I‚Äôd also note that our least successful, and most successful minority groups (neither of these being Latins) each have taken victimhood to heart, and have, in their own ways, used it as a club to beat the rest of society with.

        The ‚Äòerror message‚Äô I saw gave the impression Zman de-platformed himself. The ‚Äòcontact‚Ä¶‚Äô was Zman.Keep up the fight. I was going to sign up for gab‚Ä¶ Is that a useful rally point for when they come for you next? Poxing you for mentioning the Black Plague?Lies. Damn Lies. Statistics. Mix. Combine. Rinse. Reorder. Repeat. The Cloud persons regularly ThinkLaunder thinks/things/personas they non grata.Actual facts are Laundered to take the stain of, in this case, BlackPlague, out. Gossip is Laundered to become squeeky clean evidence to secure a warrant for a non-crime.Are you gonna believe your ‚Äòlyin‚Äô eyes? Or whatz I tellz ya? We don‚Äôt want no facts which are inconventient to the Trooths we hold cherished, today‚Ä¶

                As of 9pm EDT, still having issues with the Zblog.  I tried 3 different browsers (Chrome, Dolphin &amp; Edge) and  I cannot connect (ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED)  Changed DNS servers. Nothing works.  The only way I could connect was going through an annonymous proxy page.  Wondering if my ISP has you on some sort of blacklist.

        @Z, et al. You do know that the Banana Empire‚Äôs official stats on violent crime have been skewed against YT since the 1970‚Äôs no? The FBI reports, first reference years ago by Jared Taylor in ‚ÄúThe Color of Crime‚Äù, split out the invented race ‚ÄòHispanic‚Äô as a separate group when counting the victims of violent crime but deliberately lump them in with whites when reckoning the perpetrators of violent crime. Even with this obviously deliberate attempt (three guesses who cooked up the formula back in the Nixon justice dept.) to skew the results to make whites look more violent than they are, blacks are still massively more violent. Of course now with things like the ‚ÄòCompstat‚Äô system used in a number of big cities, murders are routinely re-classified as accidents and missing persons.

        Following the history of gun control and firearms in the United States is very instructional in watching how the viewpoints have changed.Gun control in the US has it‚Äôs roots in keeping firearms away from blacks.Apparently way back in the 1860‚Äôs ‚Äì people had the common sense that you shouldn‚Äôt put guns in the hands of blacks, so they put legislation into place to restrict access to firearms ‚Äì for blacks.Ever heard the term ‚ÄúSaturday Night Special‚Äù (it was pretty common back when I was a kid in the 70‚Äôs) ?   A Saturday Night Special is a cheap revolver.  Cheap means poor people can buy it.  Poor people is synonym for black people.https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Saturday%20Night%20SpecialA slang term for an inexpensive, small-caliber revolver. Dave Kopel, Research Director at the Independence Institute, explains:The ‚ÄúSaturday night special‚Äù is in part a linguistic descendant of the racist phrase ‚ÄúNiggertown Saturday Night.‚Äù The obvious implication of the phrase ‚ÄúSaturday night special‚Äù is that it is a gun used by ‚Äúniggers‚Äù to shoot each other with during their wild Saturday nights. No one denies that the people disarmed by a ‚ÄúSaturday night special‚Äù ban would be predominantly poor and non-white.Saturday Night Specials are preferred by the lower classes, therefore they must be dangerous.Ever watched the movie Glory?  (Denzel Washington, Matthew Broderick).There‚Äôs a scene in the movie where the first black recruits are brought in and handed their rifles ‚Äì they start playing with them like 10 year olds.  The Irish sargent gets pissed‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.     That movie came out about 19 years ago.  Even then there were some shreds of race realism still to be found in the culture.

        A few years back i hard a black spox explaining that crime was inevitable since people kept putting all them damned liquor and gun stores in the hoods.

Few whites will talk honestly about race because they fear the repercussions. It‚Äôs a severe handicap that ensures exploitation of whites and their children. Better grow some ballls ‚Äî or the situation will likely worsen.

            I can understand this, but don‚Äôt allow fear of repercussions to prevent speaking of race issues among the immediate family, especially your children.  I know I had the ‚Äútalk‚Äù with my daughter before she went off to college.  Prior to that, while she lived at home, I would casually bring up local news stories regarding minority shenanigans among the University athletes at the local school.  The point always was that these people were not the same as she had interacted with so far in her life and caution was required.  No different than walking alone late at night through an unsafe neighborhood.

                    Lots of white folks still believe in the ‚Äúcollege experience‚Äù and credentialism even in the HBD movement.That said, even Jordan Peterson who is a university professor and liberal openly states parents shouldn‚Äôt send their kids to college because of the damage that is inflicted on them.

                        Its changing a tiny bit, Even the news which I was cozened into watching mentioned that lots of jobs require no degree now.They were even neutral about it to my surprise.That said if the US were say 90% White and free of Leftists it would be one of the safest best nations on the planetGetting there would not be easy though it is possible if the will is there.Also are going to have to stop conflating economic policy with social policy. You can have a homogeneous socially conservative state with or without some wealth redistribution or business regulationMore power to the rich and global corporations is not an inherently conservative idea and is closer to what it says on the tin, economic liberalism

        Well, in a way, it is indeed a spiritual problem, because Whiteness or White Privilege or the idea that guns carry curses that only black people are sensitive to ‚Äì these are all constructs of African mysticism.
The violence itself may not be the result of spiritual forces, but the sophistry around it definitely is. The discourse has literally been Africanized.

        Ok, let me see if I can connect a few dots. I own guns and have never shot anyone. So there‚Äôs that.The left loves them some African-Americans. How do I know? I saw it on TV.But, but. Their pet religion, abortion ‚Äì has resulted in millions less black Americans since inception. Pay no attention to the ‚Äòdreams of Margaret Sanger‚Äô and her stated intent to reduce the quantity of racial inferiors in the country.But, wait, black on black crime is quantified by the data to be the main form of crime that African-Americans suffer from. The statistics are indisputable, and massively one-sided. Just keep feeding them some rap, some LeBron, and keep them in their ghetto.Hell, in his book from 1903 ‚Ä¶. ninteen ought three ‚Ä¶Booker T. Washington laid out the problem of black unemployment. And the ills that it bred. Yes, he used a badthink word in the title, ‚ÄúThe Negro Problem‚Äù. At least it wasn‚Äôt LBJ‚Äôs ‚Äúnig-rah‚Äù. In any case, Washington stated that during the Antebellum Period, blacks were taught trades. If you needed a suit, you went to a black tailor. Shoes? A black cobbler. And so on. After the Civil War, blacks were indeed free, but there was no replacement for the skills they had been taught‚Ä¶ and as Washington said then ‚Ä¶ did I mention 1903?!?!?! ‚Ä¶ ‚Äòa few black professors‚Äô should not distract from the plight of the majority, lacking skills to gain employment.And now? The left has not done a thing. N.O.T.H.I.N.G. except EXPLOT their beloved African-Americans. Worse, while post Civil War black intact familied (aka marriages) actually exceeed whites for a time ‚Ä¶. now over 70% of black children are born out of wedlock. So ‚Äòworse than nothing‚Äô is the net result ‚Ä¶ and we still see the Ben Carson, Condoleeza Rice, and sports ballers like that Hillary Clintoon shill LeBron, raised up for their racial ‚Äòcommunity‚Äô. Yet, there are as many bad actors raised up, rappers too numberous to list, race-baiters like Sharpton ‚Ä¶ et. al.So the blacks kill one another in droves. Black pregnancies are aborted at a clip of almost 50% of live births (444 to 1,000). One would think the left HATES them some black people ‚Ä¶ but for ‚Äòlook, a rayciss over there!

            Hope I am misreading or misunderstanding your comment, because it seems to imply that there are no genetic differences and all Negroes need is job training and intact families to realize true equality.  In other words, Chicongo and similar cities suck solely because of Democrat politicians, i.e. DR3.
As far as intact Negro families exceeding Whites for a time, untrue.  Exhaustively researched and documented by blog Those Who Can See.

        ‚ÄúThey think blacks are compelled to violence by guns.‚Äù  Which suggests a fun disruptive tactic: Saying (ideally in your best Foghorn Leghorn voice) that this is why we need stricter Negro control.  Obviously we can‚Äôt remove all sixty-two gazillion firearms from America, for the simple reason that a gun is much smaller than a Mexican and we‚Äôre told, by every liberal in America, that it is **simply impossible** to deport even the kind of criminal aliens that murder cute little joggers in Iowa (even when you‚Äôve got him in custody!).  But we *can* track Negroes.  In fact, we‚Äôve field-tested the technology extensively already.  It should be a snap for the people who Fucking Love Science ‚Ñ¢ to use computer modeling to track Negroes into areas where they‚Äôre likely to encounter one of these magic, violence-causing firearms‚Ä¶.

            I was raised a standard lib and, although I was aware of the ‚Äúproblem blacks‚Äù in middle and high school, I also knew a few IKAGOs and kept reassuring myself things would work out.  Even after my mugging at the hands of vibrants, I still resisted wholesale connecting the dots (They‚Äôre not all bad, can‚Äôt judge everyone based on appearance, etc.).  It was not until my consular tour of hell, in the non-paradise of Jamaica, that I finally accepted that yes, the vast majority ARE all like that.  I realized the Negro ‚ÄúAmerican citizens‚Äù I was forced to visit in prison there were, in almost every way, indistinguishable from the natives.DNA is REAL.  And it matters.  Deal with it and move on.

        Even as a kid I was a gun nut. It wasn‚Äôt a good place to be because my family were all shitlibs, cucks and progs. When I was 18 my mom found my .357 Dan Wesson target pistol amongst my plunder and then told Pop about it. They put 2 and 2 together and came up with 7: Obviously I was involved with selling drugs or gangs. I remember the bitterness with which I told my father to go f himself when I got home and they confronted me. I slept outside that night. It was one of the reasons I moved out of the house and it was one of the irreconcilable friction point between us ever since.The hell of it is my family are not stupid people. But for some reason, they will not listen to any argument no matter how well civilized and reasoned. When people set their minds like that, all you can do is flip them the middle finger and tell them to lump it. It‚Äôs like that with all their other sacred dogma too like social justice, affirmative action, feminism, etc.This is why we will eventually need to kill large numbers of them as a warning to the rest. When stupidity like this sets up in people the only way to deal with it is with lead and fire. At some point we are going to have to fight or go insane with them.

            Stories like these make me glad I grew up in a time, place and family where I started shooting at something like six and my Dad bought me my own rifle when I was 12.

                My evil assed old man had us shooting when were six or so. We shot his little bolt action 22 he got when he was eight. The sights were off just a little and the old bastard new it. We would shoot and miss. Shoot and miss. He would walk up, put it to his shoulder and plink, over went the coffee can. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why boys, shouldn‚Äôt use man‚Äôs gun.‚Äù Busted him out years later when I dug that gun out of the closet, and he tried to pull it on eighteen year old me.

                Started at 8.  Then shot in the NRA junior program.  Washed a gazillion cars and saved up enough to buy an Anshutz sportetr Kept that and the H&amp;R 20 gauge passed down though my uncles in my closet from age 10 on.  Funny, but never occurred to me that these were playthings.  Or that it would be cool to shoot someone.  Grew up with too many men that actually killed people.  It left a mark on them.

            üòâ      My father was the same way.  Immigrating here after WWII, he had little use for guns.  He lived in NYC his whole life, I moved to AZ.  When in college, I bought an AR-15.  In those days, you just kept it in your room.  No one cared.One night I get a phone call from dad, he had been mugged by one of NYC‚Äôs impoverished minorities‚Äîright outside his apartment door!  First statement out of his mouth was a request for me to bring him a gun next time I visited (NYC not issuing permits except to Cloud people in those days).Does this sound like a cliche, yep, but it‚Äôs absolutely true.  üòâ

        The only good information I got out of this is that Hispanics aren‚Äôt as bad for us as I thought. Still not my people.
As far as black on black crime goes last night was a bad one, (I hear, won‚Äôt watch). Giants slaughter the Lions in sportsball.
Remember how Scandinavians used to denigrate the US for it‚Äôs violent crime? Not so much anymore given an unhealthy injection of our virus into their ecosystem. I don‚Äôt take any satisfaction out of this though, we still have too much to lose together.

            A pro-immigration trick is to lump Black crime in with White crime and then proclaim ‚ÄúSee? Immigrants ‚Äî even illegal aliens ‚Äî are more law-abiding than US citizens!‚Äù
Leave aside the fact that 100% of illegal aliens are, by definition, criminals.
Why should we want to import a population about whom the best that can be said is ‚Äúat least they‚Äôre not as bad as Boacks.?‚Äù

                Another trick is to use the phrase ‚ÄúUS born.‚Äù This hides the fact that once the threat of deportation is removed, the ‚ÄúAmerican citizens‚Äù return to the base crime rate of their race.
White ethnostate is the solution to racial crime rates.

            Mr. Johnson, a 19-year-old who loved to sing and dance, who was an athlete and a budding social activist, will not get to see that vision realized. He was shot and killed Wednesday after playing basketball near his home.
A real whodunit, wonder how that happened? Maybe the perp was an eskimo‚Ä¶

            The hispanic crime rate in Chicago used to be much higher, having had access to the Police statistics over a number of years, but has settled down‚Ä¶IMO that‚Äôs due to less Police attention due to political power, and the stability provided by the Cartel.

            Unfortunately we will not lose together but lose we shall. After we have been forced to segregate ourselves into our group identities out of a simple desire to survive the real tribal violence starts. Then the Marxist come.Sweeping in with their claims of being able to stop all the violence through the magic of socialism / communism. It‚Äôs the same old play out of the same old Playbook. Very depressing especially for our grandchildren.

            Scandinavian super high crime rates are the result of Moslime/Islamic refugee immigrants they let in. They regret if today. Like Germany and‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Rape and domestic violence are thru the roof because of these uncivilized scum.

            Combine deliberate cultural blindness with a good paycheck, and you have 95% of what passes for conservative commentary today, as witness the mess of an essay at America greatness you wrote about yesterday.

            Not OT ‚Äì he wrote an essay on exactly the same topic today.
‚Äú..most of us plain don‚Äôt care about you or your doings. There was a time when we did care, but you betrayed our good will and played us for fools. We laugh about it now, but we actually believed you wanted equal opportunity and mutual respect and to live in harmony‚Äîall that stuff. Ain‚Äôt it a hoot? Imagine our embarrassment.‚Äù
