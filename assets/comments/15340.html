        On the magical power of guns: some unlikely people share this delusion and are completely unaware of it. Some time back I was in a gun store run mostly by cops who sold mainly tactical guns, ammo and accessories. I’m a hunter, so I was there with a friend. I rarely go into such places. I was admiring one of the surplus high powered scoped rifles that had formerly been a SWAT weapon and mentioned that it would make a very good deer gun. The off duty cop who was working the counter then got into an argument with me over it because he thought it would be dangerous to let the rubes in rural areas use such powerful weapons and conjured up images of bodies lying everywhere in the state forests. Seriously. This from a guy I can guarantee you has never hunted a day in his life. Claimed to be a big supporter of the 2A.His experience with firearms is limited to his job and the shooting range. When I asked him about why he was interested in guns he actually said that he just liked to go to the range. Outside work, guns were a hobby for him, but one he engaged in with great vigor, even taking a part time job related to it. IOW he gets a kick out of shooting powerful weapons, and probably assumes this is the only reason anyone could have interest in them as well. He was engaging in a form of projection when it comes to hunters. To concatenate further, guns have a sense of magic to him, so he assumes they have this same magical power over everyone else.Guys like him like the idea of us going around with unscoped percussion cap muzzle loaders. I had a friend of mine almost shoot me with one once. He was coming back toward camp and a buck jumped out in front of him. He took a shot at it and hit my truck. My response to this was to sell him–practically give him–a muzzle loader with a scope. The scope forces you to see what you are shooting at. He never took a bad shot again.It is a case of a gun enthusiast who probably is one of the safest, most persnickety guys at the range, very much in control, because he is aware of how intoxicating shooting is to him. And he thinks it is the same for everyone else. These are the same kind of gun nuts who facilitate ridiculous regulations despite the fact that they love guns. In a philosophical sense they are ratio type thinkers trying to force their form of thought onto a world where it would be best to have at least some modicum of intellectus input. Theory vs reality.Comparing my own habits to his, I rarely, if ever, go to a range. I probably take about 50-100 shots total in a year. My biggest concern is if I am going to hit and bring down an animal I am shooting at, and not falling out of trees. Safety concerns? I wonder how many range shooters have had a shotgun fall out of a tree, hit the ground with the muzzle pointed at them, have it cycle a round, but not go off. And this with a slug, not bird shot. Things like this don’t happen with high powered rifles that are mostly bolt action with no cartridge in the chamber. IOW, a loaded shotgun with no bullet in the chamber is still a danger to you, but a high powered rifle is not. What I’m saying here is that guys who shoot at ranges cannot be expected to be experts in the appropriate uses of firearms, no matter how expert they are at shooting, reloading and ballistics. These are handy forms of information, but they are not the full picture.How many of you that were in the military considered your commanding officer who went through ROTC and officer training school to know more about your gun than you did? Especially if you were an NCO?I get no thrill out of the act of shooting itself. I don’t even get that big of a thrill out of the kill. I watch these guys on the hunting shows and how they are literally shaking with excitement after taking down an animal. The average hunter is nothing like that. Think about it. Those guys are so crazy about hunting that they film themselves doing it. It’s like having sex with a mirror on the ceiling and taking home movies. Normal people don’t do that. I get a feeling of satisfaction that a plan has worked out and that the freezer will get filled.My buddy also says he never saw that guy at the store again after that. Thinks the owner heard about it. Only time I was ever there.

            There are some people who like range life because it makes them feel like they are doing something manly. I’ve seen this a few times. I suspect they are quite afraid of firearms, but they overcome it to go to the range and that makes them feel manly. Otherwise, that spooky fear of guns remains with them.There is a cultural gap between hunters and shooters. I know a lot of hunters who never go to the range. They have no interest. The Left has always tried to exploit this with the “I’m not opposed to hunting” stuff, but no one believes the gun grabbers on anything at this point.

                I would say that facing and overcoming your fears is kind of manly.  I knew plenty of Marine Recruits who had never fired a gun before Boot Camp and were nervous going to the range the first time.

        A few comments on this most excellent podcast:1) The “social issues” of the 1980’s covered a number of things not mentioned, including the expulsion of religion, i.e., Christianity, from the public square (e.g., prohibition of religious clubs in in public schools, the Grove City Supreme Court decision, removal of religious monuments from public land), the mainstreaming of bastardy and homosexuality (e.g., the Murphy Brown television show, the removal of homosexuality from the DSM, AIDS “rights”) and the full implementation various feminist and racialist priorities (e.g., Title IX with, among other things, its gutting of men’s sports, racial preferences and reverse discrimination)3) When you talked about the “white faculty” at Harvard, I assume you really meant the “(((white))) faculty”…2) No one talks about federal deficits or the federal debt because it it almost entirely driven by entitlement programs, with defense spending the only other significant player. Support for a radical reduction in defense spending is very small, and calling for the reduction in entitlement programs is tantamount to political suicide. (Recall the image of heartless Republicans pushing the elderly in wheelchairs off a cliff.)

        Is there a specific strategic reason why Jeff Sessions’s Department of Justice is prosecuting people for defending themselves against leftist violence while refusing to take any action against the violent leftists who incite these confrontations?  I recall the attacks on people attending Trump rallies during the 2016 campaign, and the hopes that once Trump took power, there would be some “cleanup” operations against those thugs via the executive branch agencies like the DOJ and the FBI.Instead, the opposite is happening.  Why are Trump and Sessions authorizing this?  It is very dispiriting to anyone who might feel inclined to stand up for Trump in public.  Not only will he not protect you, but he might very well send you to federal prison for defending yourself.  Why?

        It would be an earth shattering event if the Harvard case were to lead to the destruction of affirmative action, aka “quotas”. I have waited for this all my life. I’m not hopeful.

            The amusing part is it turns the “disparate impact’ debate back on the Left. I don’t think the plaintiffs are making this claim, but they could. That is, the Harvard polices may not be explicitly discriminatory, but the effect is the same. Of course, this pens the door for whites to bring the same action, claiming that they are under represented, which is true, if you put Jews in a separate bucket.The trouble here is there are only two rational laws in a multi-racial society. Either people are free to discriminate as they see fit or no one can discriminate on anything. Both are incompatible with the morality of Progressive multiculturalism.

                Again it’s all really about power of the groups involved.  Racial discrimination in the form of AA is fine, so long as you don’t call it a Quota system.  I’ll leave it to everyone to sort out the subtext of that statement.   Based on that premise I predict the Chinese will lose this.  Although there might be some compromise, they win a couple more nominal spots.

                    Yeah, I don’t think there is an obvious result that is consistent with the progressive narrative. Asians have been trying to worm into the ruling coalition, but they are not a great fit and the people at the top are not all that interested in making room for them. I’ve always agreed with Derb on this. East Asians are a much more natural fit with whites in the race realist camp. I’ve never met an EA that was not sensible about ethnicity, once it was safe to speak freely. I suspect Progressives feel this too and will be happy to throw the EA’s out of the coalition.The court has a problem though. Things like affirmative action are at odds with the logic of the law. For decades they have mostly avoided the issue, leaving it to legislatures to sort through. Sandra Day O’Connor acknowledged this three decades ago. As the country becomes majority-minority, the court will have to address it. If it is OK to discriminate on behalf of a group, then it must be OK to discriminate against a group. You cannot do one without doing the other. Therefore, if this case makes it to the Supreme Court, my guess is they rule that using race, sex or ethnicity at all is illegal. That strikes me as the safest course for the court.

            A/A bans at the state level (Michigan/California) were defied by the university bureaucracy, which tried to make the admissions as “holistic” as possible. This case is headed towards SCOTUS next year, and even if “we” win, they will find more Talmudic hairsplitting ways around the law.
The most insidious aspect of A/A is that we don’t know which specific person benefits, and which specific person pays. Introducing transparency is the most important aspect of this case. If anything, we’d need to not only ban using race in admission, but also forbid “diversity recruiting events”.

                This is correct. The Supreme Court decision will make no difference. There is an entire industry dedicated to “diversity” in academics and large corporations. This industry will defy any ruling from the Court.
The best the right can hope for is that the insanity of AA will continue to deliver normies to the right.

                    We condition financial aid on family income over several years. A compromise palatable to moderates is to means test A/A benefits so they don’t flow to higher income non-whites, while benefiting poor whites and Asians. The Ivies could also be forced to drop legacy preference, which these days benefits Jews more than the WASPs it was designed for in the last century.

                        regarding “means testing”:Isn’t it interesting that Leftist policies like Affirmative Action, Food Stamps or other Welfare benefits, always end up requiring PERVASIVE SURVEILLENCE?Their policies depend on categorizing people according to “need”; so let’s investigate every aspect of their financial lives.… or it depends on determining who gets special treatment according to their race; so let’s DNA test everyone so they can be found to be eligible or not.Everything the Left proposes will eventually devolve into a police state, with massive tracking and surveillence … because they think that only they can judge what “Fairness” is, based on what they know about you.

                            I’ve never heard of anyone being asked to cough up a DNA test for A/A. I’m not even sure if background checks are used to disqualify. Steve Sailer pointed out that it operates on an honor system.
The Obama Admin and most states granted waivers to SNAP/TANF/UI work requirements during the recession. Surveillance and means testing were designed to address conservative complaints about welfare programs. A compromise to prevent total defunding, which risks an uprising.

            There are DSA chapters on almost every university campus. Antifa is just the “military wing” of DSA. Its not out of the realm of possibility that DSA entryism could either take over the Democrats in the 2020s, or else split off and become a political party in their own right.

                “Antifa is just the ‘military wing’ of DSA”.  Antifa=“military”?  Hahaha.  More like junior high bullies. They can bust your tail, especially in groups, but they are merely semi-organized thugs high on their own dopamine hits.  Though I wouldn’t put it past Soros to have some serious-sh*t trainers in there.

                    The rank and file are too stupid and poorly educated to realize they are modeled on Mussolini’s Black Shirts.  Most them, however, were WWI combat Vets like Mussolini himself.  Brawling them in the streets was no joke.

                        Most of the parties in Weimar Germany had “military wings”, the Nazis had the SA, the original Antifa was the armed wing of the KPD.
The Antifa of today don’t seem to take inspiration from Sinn Fein’s armed wing the Real IRA, despite the ideological similarity.

                    Dutch, you are mistaken, the antifa groups are supported by the power structure . that is why they are almost never charged when they are filmed  committing felonious  assault they are not arrested or charged.  even in ridiculous cases like this one:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSjIOHvdlY. this sort of thing is just the opposite of what happens to the proud boys.the power structure creates and funds antifa. some may be effeminate , but some of them are paid  hardened union goon types

                            You’re dreadfully wrong about that – the deadliest single antifa-involved protest was, in fact, in Dallas.  Five cops were shot dead and nine more police and bystanders were wounded.  Right in the middle of Dallas.

Whenever I hear ‘Girls Just Wanna Have Fun’ I start laughing like a loon imagining blue haired land whales and morbidly obese she-twinks with face tackle.

        The hedge fond maneger Ray Dalio has recently addressed the US deficit and said that huge cuts will come the coming years or the dollar as a world currency will be dropped. He calls it a national emergency and calls for political cooperation. I think nothing will happen.

            I relation to Ray Dalio statmentment I came across some interviews with other investors (5.min) who sees a crisis coming with insolvency outside the banking system but also US debt that in theory go to 10% of GDP in a recession with over 100% of debt to GDP; “That is what you see in a 3.rd world country and could finish the dollar as a world currency”.

        I was busy this week and had not seen the Proud Boys news. As per usual, the video in the link is shit and I can’t tell what happened. The NYT article made it appear that the Proud Boys randomly attacked innocent bystanders who were fashionably dressed in black and had covered their faces with scarves to ward off an autumn chill. Can anyone enlighten me with the real story?

            Antifa ambushed some Proud Boys who were leaving the event. More Proud Boys arrived to back up their boys. The boys had Antifa on the ground in seconds. They got a few more shots than necessary on the ambushers, which was filmed. Than the cops and cooler heads broke it up.

        The NR crowd is giving McInnes the boot.https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/10/17/gavin-mcinnes-right-wing-violence-221578That immediately makes me somewhat sympathetic to him and his organization. In general it’s probably unwise to join any organization that is led by a comedian. Notoriety isn’t a bad thing for McInnes. It raises his profile and he gets him more hits for his radio show and videos. Gives him material for his act too. Notoriety is terrible for the Proud Boys fans. Arrest records, having one’s name out there on the internet for potential employers to find, stupid pictures that are on the Internet forever, etc…As someone else said in another comment, private is the way to go. Not sure how to get there. Even when our side does things on the down low, like just a simple email mailing list, the content leaks and everyone involved is exposed. Perhaps shunning the Internet as much as possible is the way to go.

The fact proud boys have uniforms and that antifa knows what those uniforms are – simply means that they are inviting themselves to doxxing and attacks

                Gavin miscalculated that he could be allowed by the Js to exist because he disavowed racism.  He is currently being punished for his mistake and will eventually join us.  This is a process that all white constitutional conservatives must go through.  We must try to be patient with them as reality schools them.  Try not to laugh at them.

                    Whenever I read about groups on the right, who advertise and hold meetings/conferences in hotels or other public places, I wonder why they don’t hold their events on someone’s private property. An estate or farm. There has to be someone with the means to host an event. The lack of bullshit would be worth the effort. Does anyone else see have a thought on this?

                I’m pretty sure Gavin McInnes is a globalist pet provocateur, kept by the deep state via the likes of Disney (who sponsored Vice, which is a deep state CIA propaganda bullhorn — Gavin co-founded Vice). He is put out there to create the image of white men as rude, stupid, childish, bigoted, big-mouths. Any organic, genuine provocateurs or pro-white-men leaders get in trouble with the law and are sidelined early on. People don’t know their names like we know Gavin’s.

        zman – i’m not trying to blackpill here. But isn’t affirmative action still possible if done in a roundabout way? Kavanaugh will probably get rid of AA, but all that means is you’ll have states do a “top ten% of graduating class” rule. I really doubt Kavanaugh would write “anything less than test-only is unconstitutional”

            this is already in place in Michigan . college admission uses “rank in class ” in leiu of ACt or SAT in admissions . in other words , being in the top 10% of the Detroit or flint (HUGE) school districts  you get preference.  this also give special preference to ” underserved ” high schools .  This preference also factors into your financial aid award.

        Spring seemed to be the same this year. Very short, and all of a sudden it was summer. Very little time for some of the usual springtime things to happen. Not much of a year for wild mushrooms as a result. It also seemed to me that the deer had their fawns relatively late, and I’m thinking that the rut may come a little late, too. Slow onset to pre-rut activity. The oaks produced a large harvest of acorns, and the deer aren’t moving as much as usual for this time of year. Very few scrapes and rubs as compared to what we usually see this time of year. While the weather we had this year was outstanding for growing crops everything else seems off.

            Here in Lagos, it rained so much it felt like the jungle, in every way you can imagine it. I headed West two weeks ago and it was in the high 80’s here. In Arizona it was mid-70’s. Over the last weekend, someone flipped the switch. We had frost this morning.

        Very disappointed in Asians.
It seems some populations don’t understand “divide and conquer” political operations.
They are getting played.
Once they “win” this fight and get these “race neutral admissions”, mark my words, the white percentage at major schools will go up, not down.
It’s a scam to get rid of rules that force integration.  Asians should read a book and look at there“allies”

            Your statement, “Very disappointed in Asians.” betrays your hubris and unconscious racism.  Not all Asians are the same but identity politics asswipes like you lump them together in the hopes that as a bloc they’ll support your agenda.  When they don’t, you feel hurt and lash out.

                There’s no need here, to purport to read someone’s mind, about “hubris and unconscious racism”.But, like Derb, I’ll take chances with Orientals, that I won’t take with Sun People.

            If they win this fight, and get these “race neutral” admissions thrown out, it could spur the Left into an infantile hissy-fit, much to our benefit.  What’s wrong with that?
