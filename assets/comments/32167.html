        This cautionary tale ignores the rot that is at the heart of the problem. The nominal President of the United States of America shits his pants in public. That is no trivial thing. And that image alone fundamentally undermines confidence in US strength and vitality going forward. Our election system is broken and rigged. All our major institutions are now being run by corrupt idiots whose sole talent is parasitism. Our military is a woke charade. No one likes a bully, which is what our government has become. Methinks our decline will be more like a bank run.

            There have to be several countries planning a way to diminish the standing the United States without wrecking their own economies in the process.  It is somewhat surprising to me that Taiwan hasn’t been trying to cut a deal with the Chi Coms.  Maybe there is too much bad blood there, but they have to be terrified at the prospect of our insane government plunging them into a war.  It would be incredibly destructive to Taiwan and almost certain they would lose.

                I suspect Taiwan fears a CCP control of their industry and a lessoning of a generally free capitalistic system of profit under their current government.  Certainly, they are now diverting their major industry, semi-conductors, out of their island.

If you mean the $13bn fabrication plant the TSMC has built in Arizona, that’s because of arm-twisting by the Biden administration. It remains an open question to me whether this plant will be profitable.

                        They signed up for 3 plants, but stopped at one—so far.  Instead switching that 2nd plant to *Japan*.  That doesn’t sound like US arm twisting.  Biden admin simply offered incentives to build, but failed to correct the most off-putting aspects of building new plants in the USA: environmental regulations, and an ignorant and lazy work force.  You don’t run a chip fabrication plant with burger flippers.Son is in manufacturing, high up, in the Phx metro area.  That’s basically his entire conversation when the topic comes up—work force and regulation.  You can’t even fire the incompetent and move on.Moving manufacturing back to the USA is one thing, making it a world class competitive enterprise is another.

                            Yeah, I agree. I heard TSMC sent some US “engineers” to Taiwan for training with — *ahem* — rather mixed results.

                                Son has been to Taiwan several times.  Always leaves impressed.  Why not?  You can grab a rice farmer out of the field over there and have more success putting him on a production line than you can hiring most college grad’s here.

                        The USA will never be a major chip manufacturer ever again (because I believe it was one in the 1970s and 1980s before it went offshore like so much else). We have a workforce that not only struggles to get your burger and fries order correct, but is also protected by the state from any reprocussions for being incompetent and lazy. How is something like a modern chip ever going to be made? I read an op-ed about all the diversity stuff in the chip act too – the sad thing is, the peope in charge actually believe in all this.I also want to note that, in just the past decade, China has built up a homegrown chip industry from basically nothing. Not just in making the chips but designing them. They did so largely out of necessity due to sanctions and security fears, but they did it, and in basically the amount of time the USA has been talking and handing out gibs to chip makers.

                            Yep.  Actually, I read that the Chinese really just need to get their hands on the current generation of high tech chip manufacturing machinery that Taiwan has.  The Taiwan factories and personnel would simply be a bonus.

                                Yes, China lacks the advanced process nodes of Taiwan, but they are catching up reallllllllly fast. So soon China will be able to design the chips, something Taiwan can’t do, and make them, something the US can’t do. The Brandon admin thought they were crippling China in 2022 when they started restricting what China can buy, but they forgot they are not dealing with a vassal state that depends on the US for everything, or a third world country full of low IQ people that can’t make cement without it getting shipped from somewhere. Of course, Brandon’s response to this dynamic was to keep banning China from buying more chips.

                            That seems to be a problem here across the board. Even well intentioned efforts from the top to improve things turn into a looting expedition once they get down to the level of the people who (are supposedly) implementing them. *Everything* just turns into another opportunity to reward well connected corporations and billionaires. If the project never gets done who cares? The grift was the real point.This may even be why the US picked such worthless countries as “arch-enemies”. It means huge new outlays for exotic weapons systems to fight basically primitive people. Building a giant space laser to vaporize jihaddis isn’t really necessary but it sure is lucrative if you know the right people. Trying to take on the Russian bear or the Big Panda might well show that a lot of this sci-fi stuff is just junk.

                        Also, are the new American fab plants future proof ? We are getting to extreme limits on current wafer size – 3nM. The next generation of chips will work with light. The Chinese have a massive lead in Optical chip technologies which will replace contemporary chip fabrications.There is a real risk that the US govt is sinking billions of $ into facilities which will be out of date by the time they are ready for mass production operations.The clumsy design and implementation of sanctions on Chinese tech industries is max clown world. Don’t they solicit advice from Silicon Valley experts before implementing such short-sighted policies ?

                From what I understand, China is in a pretty tough position herself.  They are trying to unwind major bubbles.  The corruption pervades every aspect of life and business.  Someone stole the fuel in some rockets and replaced the fuel with water.  This was exposed a few months ago when they failed to launch.  Some additional RE companies have or are collapsing. Vanke, I believe is one of them.  I think there may be a big state owned RE company that is also teetering.

                        That’s been true for decades. At least with some of our economic “data”  Like how our official unemployment numbers are just made up in the birth death model.  Or like how our headline inflation numbers are inflation minus inflation.  Google Hedonic Adjustment.  It’s comical.

                            Indeed, i believe the Boskin commission was when they rejiggered the CPI to understate inflation.  A Win Win, inflation is “psychological” so by understating it people will “believe” and we pay out less in social security or anything indexed to it, like wages.

                            The official employment/unemployment numbers are pretty bogus, hence the revising.  AZ Congressional Rep Schweikert spoke on this recently.  Seems the Fed gathers many stat’s from the position advertisements in the trades, which have been known to be advertisements for non-positions or rather positions that are not meant to be filled.  He had an explanation for this, but I forget exactly what.  He did say 17 out of the last 18 Red numbers were revised significantly therefore.  He said they are working to stop this practice for gathering (bogus) info, but as of yet no progress.

                            I’ve been hearing that China was on the verge of collapse, that it’s economy would implode, and that it could never compete with the U.S. on the world manufacturing stage.
China’s been around for 5000 years or so.  We’ve been in business for maybe 300.  I keep that in mind when evaluating claims of China’s imminent demise, or our imminent triumph.

                                That ignorant bozo John McCain called Russia “a gas station masquerading as a country.” That “gas station” came into existence some nine centuries before the US and produced geniuses such as Mendeleev, Suvorov, Pushkin, Lermontov, Mandelshtam, Pasternak, Blok, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Turgenev, Chekhov, Gogol, Glinka, Borodin, Rimsky-Korsakov, Mussorgsky, Glazunov, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov, Prokofiev, Shostakovich and Kandinsky.

                    Xi Jingping announced residential real estate is for homes, not for speculation. The fall of prices of Chinese real estate is orchestrated so their young people and village dwellers can afford to own a home.Chinese banking is a public utility, hence they can write down defaulted debts without consequence except to speculators. American hedge fund operators bought the bonds of bankrupt Evergrande Real Estate hoping the USA would force the Chinese government to make good on the bonds. The Chinese People’s Republic allowed the NYC speculators to lose 99% of their money.China does not allow billionaires and parasites to thrive at the expense of ordinary people, unlike the predatory elites of the Outlaw Empire.

                        It gets better than that… Even ‘honest’ billionaires get ‘invited’ to join the CPC when they start getting noticed. This isn’t so much co-opting them as putting them under internal party discipline. So you get situation where a guy who is a ‘Master of the Universe’ gets to join a strongly hierarchical oversight and governance organization *at the bottom*. Now imagine being able to do that to Jeff Bezos. OK, you can ‘own’ everyone’s data and run the government cloud for us, but *we* (who live only to govern and live pretty well if we don’t eff it up or die violently if we do eff it up) own your billionaire ass. That’s exactly what the CPC did to Jack Ma.Now in the USA the billionaire class *must* buy off chunks of the government because otherwise the government will tear them to shreds in an orgy of greed and lawfare (e.g. Gates had a close run thing with anti trust in the 90s before started up his foundation and lobbying operations and got ahead of their OODA loop.) Ditto Musk and Thiel have had to make Faustian bargains with elements of the Deep State in order to be ‘free’ to pursue their other interests.

                    They have their problems. But then again they seem to have managed to plonk a lunar lander on the far side of the moon the week before last to collect samples for earth return.They have hypersonic missiles (along with the Russians). You do not. Sorry to say but the Skunkworks in Current Year probably looks like the DMV.I think some of these reports you’re reading are low-grade Epoch Times (run by CIA / Falun Dafa — Syncretic Chinky cult in a feud with CPC, long story) and/or YouTube loser grifters such as ‘serpentza’.Don’t believe everything you read. Don’t smoke the Copeium.There’s a lot of ruin in a country as the saying goes. The USA will circle the drain slowly and still has bits that work (e.g. probably the submarine part of the triad. Probably. They have women on those too, now.) China isn’t a paper tiger, but it’s not the Terminator, either.Just chill about China. Stick to dealing with your local (ahem) feral fauna issues and cleaning out your Augean Stables. Plenty to be done there.

                        Did you actually read the post I wrote?  I said I heard she was having some economic trouble and a lot of corruption.  They have a really big RE bubble.  The corruption is something we Americans deal with all the time.  All the pirated goods.  All the junk not fit for sale. The drugs coming across our border from China.Having economic troubles is not to say they (the state or the party) are on the verge of failing, just that these appear to be trying times.  I am also well aware that I don’t speak Chinese and can’t read it either.  I take what I read with a grain of salt, not only about China, but the US too.I have no illusions about their being a paper tiger.  They can probably build a fleet of carriers in the time it takes us to build one.  The US built 90 carriers during ww2.  It takes more time than the length of ww2 to build a single carrier.  Granted, many were small or conversions, but it is still a feat we could not do today and China probably could.  I pay little attention to the weirdos who spend their time hating China.

Hell, they can probably build that fleet before we can decide which fag we are going to name our imaginary carrier after.

            Biden is such a bad look, I’m surprised that even Boomer lefties take him seriously. But they do.Of course what follows is that other countries start asking, why is (at least) half the populace voting for these sad jokes? Maybe Americans and their government is stupid, or ignorant, or both, and is not worth other countries’ time. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Russia, and to an extent Brazil, India, and China, respect power and the Man in charge. It’s the historical norm and what focuses geopolitical relations. When you want to cut a deal with the Americans, whom do you call? Certainly not Biden or his pet Kamala. Do you call some Senator or some high-level bureaucrat? General Milley? Do you call Obama?Not that the US needs a strongman, but it would be nice to get back to a place where the Executive is the fucking Executive.

                I’ve said it before, there needs to be a strong man in charge simply for the ability to make back door “deals” that other strong man leaders will believe.  We don’t see much reporting on these in current media, but historically we read often enough of such “agreements” between leaders.

                I can’t do any better than to quote Patrick Deneen on this one:“People keep suggesting that it’s outrageous to keep Biden as the Democratic nominee. I disagree. Biden is actually perfect to lead the progressive liberal party. Its functionaries run the entire government — all of the agencies, the cabinet, and the inner circle of executive branch operatives. They have a giant publicity arm in the mainstream media, and by extension, the entertainment industry. Their court intellectuals run the universities. Their people are in charge of the military. A Democratic president is about as essential to running the US government as the king is to England. Arguably, even less essential. This is so obvious to the Democrats, they don’t even have to pretend to have a candidate in compos mentis, and it’s rather an audacious and troll to keep him at the top.”The only problem is the election, which obviously must be rigged. That will be more difficult this time around. Still, 110% turnout in Milwaukee and Philadelphia is probably ball game.And if not, they can always start a war.

            The vaunted Soviet Union collapse occurred over 17 weeks. The collapse in America may be just as quick, and start out of the middle nowhere. Nothing would surprise me at this point.

            I believe a lot of this unwinding has already been planned based on the coming “Great Reset.” Biden is just there to take the heat so that Trump wouldn’t have to. In a sense, Biden was compromised and MAGA blackmailed him (Jeffrey Epstein style) to be the fall guy. Trump will come in and clean up whatever else needs to be cleaned up to get us on the right path.
If Trump had to take all this heat, we never would be able to get to all the mop-up work because of his lack of popularity.

        “They cleaned up their banking system to root out fraud and corruption…”
in other words, they kicked the jews out of their finances and banking… which is what has the tribe in a royal snit and trying to focus American rage and firepower on Russia.
We need to do the same. Russia goes from pissant status to the 4th strongest economy in a couple years? And that, in the midst of a costly war with NATO. The mind boggles at how much that tribe is stealing from us.

                Russia does not permit dual nationals to serve in the government of The Russian Federation. One million Russian born Jews moved to Israel after the collapse of the USSR. This indicates these parasites lost their government jobs and their easy life predating the Russian people. The Russians learned hard lessons under the boot of the Jews during the reign of the USSR.

        Airports are very depressing places. You want to see White dispossession in action go to any airport. The number of joggers and birthing persons in cockpits has increased noticeably. The travelers have turned the terminal strip mall into a double take wondering if you are on the liquor store street corner. The speed at which this has occurred is breathtaking.

                Atlanta is a giant overflowing toilet bowl of diversity. The airport is an aerial sphincter, unclenching to release a new stream of sewage to keep the expansion going. From the mountains to the sea, the parasitic diversity will spread out in glee until there is no place left for whitey. The International Jew cackles, and counts his money.

        Don’t forget about the Turks. Their economy is in a mess right now, but they have the most powerful military in NATO (apart from the US, of course). The Turks see what is going on and they have taken preliminary steps toward joining the BRICS group. If membership in the EU remains closed to them, they won’t have any problem partnering up with Russia and Iran economically. It just makes sense. At that point, they will probably look around and decide that being a member of NATO is dumb and dumber.

            I’d argue the Turks have a stronger industrial base than the US because they installed the machinery in the shiny new 155mm ammo plant in Mesquite, TX. The NYT even reported on it.

        One of the strange features of the Cold War was that Republicans were much better at empire, which requires a light touch when dealing with vassels. Democrats couldn’t help but meddle in the name of democracy and justice, which led to the collapse of those vessel states (See Iran in 79). This changed with Bush the Lesser and his messianic invasion of Iraq.
Biden’s controllers did the same to the Saudis over some journalist. Trump, for all his inexperience in foreign affairs, had great instincts.

        &gt;Sanctions forced the Russians to do thigs like replace the retail credit card system with their own system. They cleaned up their banking system to root out fraud and corruption. It was an inadvertent test case for creating financial systems outside of Western control.
Note they did this is very little time too. Mind you, there were plans in the works for a while, but it’s clear a lot of American financial power was simply smoke and mirrors (and aircraft carriers).

                I heard once that “Britain sleep walked into global empire,” which totally fits. Most of it was gained by the private efforts of companies or singular individuals in government. There was no overarching strategy or vision, so it fell apart quickly.
unfortunately, I think we’re in a different boat. The powers that be have a unifying ideology and destination in mind. It’s an unintuitive form of organization, but they are organized.

                    Mitchell Lange,I believe this to be the correct view. The British East India Company, so dominant in it’s dealings and untouchable in it’s position it simply was known as ‘The Company’, started off as effectively a private endeavour.By 1788, it had achieved primacy in all parts of the Indian subcontinent that mattered, and enjoyed huge profits generated from trade and taxation. Of course, The Mutiny happened and a begrudging UK government had to step in (the UK government had been steadily getting involved since the 1830s, I believe).There was no big plan there.Same story with Africa. The Scramble, which started in the 1880s was undertaken largely by private interests, who eventually persuaded a reluctant Colonial Office to “stake Britain’s claim”. Often, it seems it was to make sure France didn’t get it instead.So in this way, it absolutely differs from GAE.

                        Actually, what I’ve read is that the East Indian Company became much less profitable after Britain defeated the French in the mid-1700s and the Company acquired more and more territory (+ subjects + taxation and other duties and responsibilities, etc.) as more British military adventurers (e.g. Wellington) went there to seek personal glory. By the time of the Sepoy Mutiny it was basically an ill-concealed shell for Imperial interests.The earlier Company was very profitable when it stuck to trade and had coastal outposts.

                        One reason the Western Roman Empire lasted as long as it did after its ruling class was de-Romanized was that the provincials who took over all had a vested interest in the continuation of the empire. They might disagree on who should get the lion’s share of the graft, but they didn’t want to burn it all down.
Here in AINO can we say the same?

                            The Roman Empire is not illustrative of the present-day United States. The U.S. has not made an OVERT play for empire in, say, Europe, by spreading from Ramstein Base to other territories within reach. Additionally, America relies on “soft power” — such as cultural properties — to maintain its psychological edge. The Romans were more hard power folks.— Xloveli (www.dark.sport.blog)

                                Instead of militarily conquering diversity then incorporating their former lands into our own as the Romans did, we have imported the diversity into our homeland area. The effect is the same: sharing a polity with diversity. My point is that our diversity overwhelmingly has no interest in maintaining the empire, whereas Rome’s diversity did.

            Varus defeat was at the official beginning of the empire during Octavian’s reign. There are many, many things that caused Rome’s fall – an accumulation of entropy. If you want two of the biggest they were unrecoverable decisions made by Marcus Aurelius.Aurelius after a big plague that killed an estimated 1.2 million Romans and in trying to fortify the Dacian frontier allowed over a million tribesman to cross the Danube and enter the peninsula with their arms. It was a Great Replacement of its own. Secondly, he addressed a massive debt problem by taking the bad advice of the coin clipper crowd. It took some time, but it triggered a mass inflation that Diocletian compounded by instituting price controls and other harsh market controls.It should sound very familiar. Of course, After the defeat by Arminius the empire thrived for a couple of hundred years. It stopped pretending to be a Republic and reached its imperial zenith. One sad part about our rhyme with Rome, is that through their Great Replacements, and there were several, their genetic stock was replenished and re-invigorated by letting in a large amount of Chad Indo-European Germanics closely related to the original Roman/Italian stock. Our Great Replacement represents the potential end of our genetic stock – for eternity.It doesn’t have to be that way, but we must be very conscious in preserving ourselves in order to survive the long winter ahead. The things we will need to do, above all constituting our identity as Indo-European man, Occidental man, will see us emerge as a giant of a people that will make our ancient and grand ancestors proud for what we will achieve. The winter ahead is long, but surviving winter is what hardened us. If we can adapt to the form this one will take our identity and resolve as a people will be unwavering for several thousand years.

        The irony of countries moving away from trading the dollar (at least in the short term) is that the dollar will strengthen. All those people yelling that the dollar will lose its value have it backward – again, at least, in the short to, even, medium term.There’s more dollar-denominated debt outside the US than in the US. That debt needs to be serviced with dollars. If fewer dollars are floating around the system (supply goes down), the value of the dollar goes up (as demand remains constant). The demise of the Eurodollar system could be caused by dollar strength, not weakness.

                “Can’t they send the debt back as stuff? Is that, possibly, what’s happening?”
Absolutely. That’s been a key part of the structural logic of the GAE: get countries in the Third World into massive dollar debt. Then, in order, to service that debt they have to export commodities to the USA. If memory serves, there’s more on this in Anthony Perkins’ book, “Confessions of an Economic Hit Man.” But you’ll probably also find more on this in various writings of Michael Hudson.

                            Jannie: I think Brazilification and Mexicanization are totally evident on the ground already in major U.S. cities all the way down to a Minneapolis or Denver level. The elites not only aren’t affected by it directly on a daily basis, but when they read about it or see news, or their nephew gets murdered by a young scholar, they have a predigested orthodoxy filter already to interpret it. They are insulated not only by financialization and credentialing, but socially-psychologically. This is where the accelerationism/MAGA-Marxism comes in, the assertion that unreformable systems must be collapsed. Which is a fun idea but just as naive as saying Saddam Hussein is a bad choice for leader, it should be more democraticky over there. If you can’t beat em, join em– the counter-elite should not sleep on this permaculture thing.

                                California is already a third world country. Mexico is not a bad parallel. Huge swathes of Mexico are actually really nice, the place has natural resources galore, great farming, and there is a class of prosperous and wealthy people who live very luxurious lives at the top of the pyramid. But, of course, Mexico has an egregious weath gap between the rich and the poor. The government is barely functional, corrupt, has no accountability due to the one-party rule. The authorities mainly justify their existence by protecting the prosperous and rich people from the peasant rabble. This describes California. Actually, in those ways Mexico might be better than California at this point, as Mexico City is a nicer and safer city for the rich than Los Angeles or San Francisco.

                                    Not to mention that to migrate to Mexico, you must prove to either have decent assets or a skill actually in demand that they have no way to supply internally.
The dross don’t move to Mexico. It’s hard enough for a solid middle class American to move there.

                Well, before our leaders screwed it up, we did provide the world with an extremely valuable service – a service that required both talented, trained people and very high-level industrial production.We provided the structure of the entire global trade and financial system. Our navy kept the sea lanes open. Our military kept a lid on any big wars. Our dollar was stable and could be used by anyone, anywhere. (The dollar was, in essence, the global language for banking and commerce, much like English is the global language which makes communicating so much easier.) Our massive financial markets kept the whole thing humming.That was an extremely valuable service for which the world paid us by buying our debt at low rates and giving us things for dollars that we just printed. It was a fair deal.But it was always destined to fail. Triffin’s dilemma. To feed the world’s demand for dollars, we had to run trade and budget deficits, particularly with countries that needed lots of oil, i.e. manufacturing countries. This meant that our manufacturing sector had to suffer. It also meant that we had to go ever more into debt.It couldn’t last.

                    It could have lasted. The Triffin dilemma is only a problem for low or stagnant growth. While one option for the reserve currency country is to reduce domestic production to encourage imports, the long-term stable option is to grow domestic production faster than population + standard of living expectations. Countries still have to export to build their currency reserves, but at a lower per-unit price.
Which path our morons chose is obvious.

                        It’d still be tough. The Petrodollar is the issue. It means that we have to run a trade deficit with countries that import a lot of oil and that’s manufacturing countries.
I suppose that we could have supplied the world with dollars by buying their assets and giving them dollars. Imagine a world where we didn’t flood the US with 3rd worlders, our workers’ standard of living grew and we owned the world via the dollar. Ah, what could have been.

                            The Petrodollar is the issue.
The petrodollar was a last ditch effort to keep centralized control in DC, rather than allow America to manufacture its way out of closing the gold window.
That’s the problem. They sold out America to keep power. Didn’t take very long before offshoring became the only practical workaround to deal with a government at war with its country.

                    There’s something about the issue I’m not getting, but it’ll click at some point.I mean, the value of the reserve currency is basically liquidity, right? It facilitates trade. That creates demand for the currency, which means more, in this case, dollars in circulation. Which will reduce the purchasing power of the dollar, even as everybody is purchasing things in dollars, right? It’s kind of paradoxical.I also notice, domestically in practice, price inflation incentivizes spending, because the money is losing purchasing power. I figure that means price deflation would incentivize saving, which is also paradoxical.But then reserve currency status would demand inflation for liquidity’s sake. To my untrained eye, it looks like a trap— the reserve currency has to be sacrificed, or trade will slow. And we can’t have that lol!Question, if you’ll permit: did China buying treasuries have something to do with keeping the yuan weak, so that Chinese exports remained dominant? Iow, were they putting wealth back into the system, instead of allowing it all to accumulate in their domestic economy? Are they currently attempting to partially wean themselves off of exports, and does that have to do with their current economic problems?

                        Sort of. The reserve currency serves not to facilitate transfers, but to hold value. The dollar is just the best managed large currency in the world, hard as that is to believe.
Facilitating exchange is a bonus, at which the dollar also is superlative, bad as it it.
And third, network effects. Since everyone else is using dollars for reserve and exchange, its easy to do currency exchanges with other central banks.
Fly in the ointment is USD has now dropped to under 60% of reserves…

                            Maybe that’s what I’m not getting. It’s hard to say the dollar holds value, for instance, when its value is being borrowed away.I’m reminded of Quigley talking about the FDR admin not understanding the nature of money. If I understand it, the idea is that the value is in trading, rather than in the things being traded.This seems a very middle man perspective to me, since the middle man gets his cut of each trade. Iow, his value is in facilitation, rather than production. It’s kind of like the banks using supercomputers to do tons of trades, skimming extra fractions off of each one.

            Exactly. Folks just don’t understand the Eurodollar system. I would urge everyone here to listen to Brent Johnson (Dollar Milkshake Theory) and his podcasts on this topic. The irony is that the entire US might collapse and the Eurodollar system might be the last vestige left functioning.

                Yeah, I was already beginning to notice that the dollar bears had some holes in their argument when I came across Johnson. His theory definitely helped me understand the dynamics better.It’ funny because I want him and his theory to be wrong, i.e. no confirmation bias here. But it’s hard to poke holes in it. I think that Z and others (including myself) are correct that the world will try to move away from the dollar. The problem is that 1) they might fail or 2) if they’re successful, it creates a huge problem that will explode before the transition to something else is complete.Anyway, here was an interesting debate between Johnson and some guy against Jim Rickards (who seems very sketchy) and some guy about the fate of the dollar. I felt like Johnson and his guy took the other guys apart.https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=794&amp;v=9eRGHlvRkwI&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dbrent%2Bjohnson%2Bjim%2Brickards%2Bdollar%26sca_esv%3D3697c3e79dce3da7%26sca_upv%3D1%26sxsrf%3DADLYWII_KxRMRBGhMlYrF&amp;source_ve_path=MzY4NDIsMzY4NDIsMzY4NDIsMjg2NjY&amp;feature=emb_logo

                He sometimes conflates debt and debt service. If enough Euro-held dollar-denominated instruments were to go into default, that might cause a “bank run” and strengthen the dollar. But that would not be caused by a central bank reducing it’s dollar reserve; the opposite. Reducing the dollar reserves would increase dollars circulating (by some measure, anyway, depending on whether it’s treasuries, dollar-denominated, etc.) making debt service easier, and reduce risk of default.
It’s like your mortgage. You don’t default because you have more liabilities than assets. You only need enough income to make the payment. Debt vs. debt service.

                    Depends on why they’re selling their treasuries. But let’s say that it was done, not because of a crisis, but because of a slow transition away from treasuries by CBs. Well, that just makes the dollar somewhat weaker, making it easier for businesses to pay back their dollar loans, which, in turn, keeps the whole Eurodollar system going on longer.I mean, what business is going to move away from the dollar when it’s still the GRC, easy to access and makes your borrowing costs less.I think that Johson is right. A weaker (but not freefall) dollar perpetuates the Eurodollar system, maybe even makes it grow. A strong dollar cause huge problems that stress the system and when the system gets stressed, people run to the dollar, making the problem worse.The real issue is that there’s no alternative. So long as that’s the case, you’ll see the paragraph above unfold either way.

            I doubt it will strengthen much, if at all, though a collapse should be almost impossible. Why? Arbitrage. Those dollar-denominated instruments have value, and currency fluctuations make Vanguard and Blackrock and Soros and that ilk very happy. Any spread will be arbitraged to the max.

                If the BoJ can’t stop the yen from falling against the dollar, I’m pretty sure that Blackrock and Soros can’t stop a rising dollar either. There’s at least $75 trillion in dollar debt outside the US.The demand for dollars will stay steady for quite some time. If the number of dollars floating around the system falls, it has to put upward pressure on the dollar. We’d need the entire global financial system to move away from dollars, not just some central banks or some businesses.Businesses would need to start borrowing in other currencies, but, right now, that doesn’t make sense. The interest rate is higher. The price fluctuations are higher. Also, the world still trades in dollars, so dollar debt makes sense.Look, I hate GAE as much as the next guy, but the Eurodollar system simply has no replacement, so it will continue until something better and safer comes along.

                    With central banking, the question is always, “Compared to what?”
Japan was not (and still is not) in a happy place if the Fed were to pull another Volker. So long as we have people like Helicopter Ben pushing QE (whatever number we are up to) the bar is extremely low. Japan only has to perform slightly better than Zimbabwe to stay in the game.
Kind of like the guys being chased by a bear.

                        Well, the whole system is shaky because there’s too much debt all around. That always makes countries, businesses and households more vulnerable to what would normally be small shocks.There’s no doubt that the Fed/Treasury have taken their foot off the gas at times, in part because various countries have told them that their markets can’t take it.Regardless, the Japanese are a special case in many ways. They hold a ridiculous amount of assets abroad and treasuries so they can sell those to defend the Yen for a long time. Their households and businesses also save like crazy to offset the govt deficits and they buy Japanese govt bonds for some strange reason.In the past three or so years, we’ve seen a lot of govt intervention in govt bond markets that were about to blow up. The UK, the ECB with Italy, the Japanese and even the US in subtle ways. That’s not a healthy system.But I do think that Johnson is right. Other countries will blow up before the US. Now, as to when that happens, who knows.

                            And Johnson may well be right. If what happens is default, he’s just telling you an accounting tautology. And that could well happen, particularly with the, what, 12th renewal of sanctions?
But if it’s just central banks de-dollarizing, the same accounting tautology tells you to expect a weaker dollar.

        The countries that make things, fix things, dig things from the ground and invent things are starting to see that they do not need the countries that merely count things.That’s a nice way to put it, Z Man. I guess it’s an affirmation of one of the very few iron laws of economics: if you have proper wealth at your disposal, then eventually you’ll get to decide the units that count it. I guess the Saudis realize this, and can just play the long game… i.e., waiting.Same with the Chinese, I suppose. Same with Russia, a country with so many natural resources, it is a wonder why we even attempted to economically sabotage them (or to think we could).I was looking at this Houthi thing the other day, not that I care massively; but I noted the immense naval response from many countries outside the usual suspects (UK and US): Pakistan, China, India. I clicked on the images of their frigates and destroyers, they sure looked modern – plus, built in theirownshipyards.It used to be that modern battle vessels were supplied to places like this (Japan comes to mind), as part of an association between the national government, a European (usually British) engineering middleman, and a European (usually British) shipbuilder. Now these folks have the ability all of their own.Whilst it is not set in stone; and whilst anything can happen and it may take it’s time, it does seem that soonnobody will much need the West anymore. I’d imagine the next 20-50 years will be a very interesting period, indeed. And likely terrifying.Then again, I always thought the US had it’s own oil supplies? Presumably, it’s demand cannot be met locally alone, so it must purchase from abroad.

            The US perhaps has a limited supply of oil—hard to tell with restrictions on extraction and exploration, but gas supplies via fracking are immense and coal was estimated a couple of decades or so ago to last for 800 years.  The Germans did make gasoline out of coal as did SA during the sanction period.  Climate Change fraud aside, fossil fuel is probably going the way of the dinosaurs anyway.  (Pun intended).

                Aww, c’mon peeps, Compsci just had to get that fossil joke in there.  Spoilsports.Now to be all, like, serious, Ol’ John D. Rockefeller Hisself attended a natural science conference in Europe in which they were clarifying a system of classification.  There it was noted all things organic were composed of C, H, O and JDR had the bright idea to claim “rotting organic matter”, so as to increase the scarcity value in the same way his fellow cryptos marketed diamonds.(I had thought the term ‘fossil’ came in with a bad paper in the 70s as part ofPetroCanada baron MauriceStrong’s Green movement, but no, the term ‘fossil’ was attached right after that conference.)The fossil layer stops at 16,000 feet.  Oil is routinely drilled for at 28,000 feet and deeper.  Abiotic refill is still too geologically slow for demand, thus Hubbard’s Peak Oil.

                    Agreed with most, including the dinosaur quip, but this caught my attention.
Abiotic refill is still too geologically slow for demand…
Neither demand nor supply are stock terms. They are functions of price. At a trillion tons of gold per atomic mass unit of oil, abiotic refill would almost certainly supply more oil than you could sell.
I get that your point was no one would be wasting something that valuable on transportation. My point is don’t bury that assumption in the text, because my experience is that most people will not understand that it was assumed.

        “The demand for dollars has kept the currency strong and thus kept imports cheap”If the winner in this has been the USA, the loser has been Saudi Arabia, forced into accepting IOUs (dollars and Treasuries of very dubious worth) and more generally everyone holding dollars worldwide because of its de facto reserve status.” … but years of mismanagement by the Biden administration has made a hash of things all over the world.”Loath though I am to say it, it’s not been merely the Biden administration (though these monkeys have vastly accelerated the process). “De-dollarisation” was already moving at a steady clip way before 2021. The Chinese and the Russians were holding periodic meetings in Yekaterinburg to discuss a strategic move away from the dollar, which has been one of the two key instruments of the GAE (the other has been the military).As the import-dependent US economy continues to shrivel in relative terms (and probably in absolute terms as well), the rationale for the dollar being the global reserve evaporates. After all, no central bank worth the name is going to hold the currencies of Zimbabwe or Venezuela. Why, then, should the US get a free ride at the expense of others? And now that the US military has been shown to be a paper tiger and consequently as the USA is unable to hold a gun to the head of other countries forcing them to accept dollars for real commodities (and it pulled the trigger of this gun in Iraq and Libya), the dollar’s days are numbered.“There is speculation that the Saudis are simply bargaining hard knowing that the Biden admin is desperate.”I doubt it. My sense is that the Saudis just want a divorce, as amicably and painlessly as possible. As you’ve pointed out at least once, within a decade the USA will no longer be wielding and influence in the Middle East. The Saudis can see this as well. They won’t renounce dealing with the USA — but the USA will become but one of several trading partners. Hegemony is gone.Slightly tangentially, here’s an interesting recent essay in New Left Review on the dollar and GAE policy of the United Arab Emirates:https://newleftreview.org/sidecar/posts/capitals-emirates

                That sounds about right. I recall looking at USA’s current account deficits in the late ’90s (when Slick Willy was at the helm), which were then running at around $500bn a year (give or take) and thinking, “This can’t go on forever. There has to be a day of reckoning.”

                No later than Nixon ’73. Every country in the world was trying to trade increasingly inflated dollars for gold, so he closed the window. The ’74 Petrodollar was in response to give countries a reason not to feel they were cheated out of their gold.

                    Exactly, it was a default.  That was why inflation was insane in 70’s and early 80’s.  It only abated because we sent high paying jobs to China and substituted them with credit.  Though we spun it as evil speculators and opec, not us defaulting on a contract we signed with the rest of the world after WW2.

                        I doubt it was the default, if that’s what it was.
The simple definition of inflation is too much money chasing too few goods. The central banks who were forced to hold dollars were obviously not putting it into circulation, as would have been the case had they converted it to gold.
The inflation of the 70s is mostly a combination of spending for Vietnam and Medicare/Medicaid, combined with the life expectancy making Social Security and government pensions vastly more expensive than forecast.

And how do you think they paid for that?  By letting people exchange the dollars they printed into existance into gold, or telling them to take it or leave it?  If you and i agree to a system where i can exchange the money you control for a defined portion of something and then you renege on that, what would you call it?

Regardless, a cause must precede an effect. US inflation was making gold exchange lucrative. Trade your dollars for gold, sell it on the European and Asian market for dollars, go back and redeem it for gold, repeat, every time at an increasing profit.
Shutting the gold window might have screwed other countries, but it was the only way to keep everything,everythingin the country from having to be sold for gold to keep that exchange going. And it wouldn’t have been enough.

        Although I’m sure the Government Party will be desperate to make a deal, I’m not sure this becomes a problem for Main Street and Manufacturing America.Higher import costs means repatriation of manufacturing.  Less global interconnectedness means greater US reliance on…itself.  The USA is a completely self-sustaining economy.  We have all the energy and natural resources we need.  Human capital is becoming a problem, but mainly because the worship of GDP requires an increase in population.  Illegals are a way to goose GDP on the cheap.  Disconnect the US economy from the globe, and suddenly those tricks don’t matter…and the Government can no longer subsidize them with the printing press.I think that’s why the regime will try to bribe the Saudis.  Being a vassal protectorate of the empire also means lots of weapons sales for the MIC.  There are all kinds of vested Government Party interests in maintaining the status quo.The Saudis are a BRICS nation.  If they decouple, we now have no reason to fight mercenary wars over there. The public grows weary of the Zionist wars and that lobby is losing its grip, too.For this, we get better jobs, fewer mercenary wars, for the low low price of 6% borrowing rates?idk, hard to see downsides for the regular Joe here.  For the Government Party?  Not so much.

            Higher import costs means repatriation of manufacturing.
This is true if and only if the natives can afford the higher prices. That seems to be in doubt.
the worship of GDP requires an increase in population.
Truth.Cet. par., higher populations consume more food, housing, energy, etc., so even if production expands to meet the increased demand and hold prices stable, GDP increases. And if they are doing productive work, GDP increases. Government spending also increases GDP, moreso if it is deficit spending, and even more when it causes inflation.
Why do you think government wants things measured that way?

        I know I’m going to get downvoted, but I believe we have been under some form of military government since after the 2012 election. Like having our own Paul Bremer in Iraq running things.Four key data points lead me to believe this:The video of the woman who snuck Zero’s birth certificate into the Hawaiian archives. Plane goes down, everybody survives except her and someone conveniently videos a diver probably stabbing her with something. Death sentence for treason?Zero being forced to exit the back of the plane in China. Countries just don’t do that to foreign leaders. Unless, of course, he wasn’t our foreign leader anymore.Google changing their name to “Alphebet.” (As in alphabet agencies, who created Google and use it to snoop on us.)Zero following Trump around every time he met with foreign leaders. We got to see that because they wanted us to see it.Downvote to your heart’s content.

        Why did we allow (((the chosen))) to hijack foreign policy so that the majority of what they do is sympathetic to their motherland? Why was nobody able to stop this monster?
You know, I also have an ancestral motherland I am sympathetic to. But if I were in a position of power, there would be no way I would do what the neocons have done in service to their motherland. As an agent of the American government, you’re supposed to look out for America’s interests first.

        So, basically, a recreation of the current arrangement, but not run out of America. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.This sounds familiar, kind of like the ‘British’ Empire moving to DC.Not a revolutionary change, not even as much as transitioning from the gold standard to the petrodollar. Smooth means speedy, the last several years’ inflation is, I’d guess, evidence the process has been going on for a while. The current geopolitical tensions could be, rather than a epoch-ending moment, a show and a distraction while the looting and transfer of wealth goes on. Could be. In any case, strangling financialization will be somebody else’s problem, and I cheer the development. Turns out the US isn’t the only country that worships money. I look forward to not being an ugly American.

        The petro/dollar was needed to get everyone to use the dollar or as some people call it the Euro/dollar. However, all the systems have been created and the dollar is now, 50 years later, ubiquitus. It can’t be replaced because nothing else can do what it does. George Gammon just tried to travel from Columbia to the U.S. border using bitcoin, gold and silver. None of it really worked because they are stores of value but poor mediums of exchange. The dollar is a near effortless medium of exchange, even if a poor store of value. The dollar will be replaced but it will take Earth shaking events not the expiration of the petro/dollar.

        The petro-dollar was a finite deal, anyway. No one expected the American reach to last forever, and the unraveling of the American sleeve only had to take place a little for the inevitable to happen.

        Totally, completely untrue. The rise of the American Empire began with global financial instruments created in the 1950s, not the alt-right talking point about the petro-dollar. This talking point, like the BRICS narrative, has an obvious agenda as propaganda for the right. It’s a favorite talking point among grifters but you might want to look up what major financial institutions base their financial backbone on. Hint… you’ve never heard about it in the news for a reason.

            While it is true that the postwar rubble and Bretton Woods gave the USA the ability to finance an empire, the petrodollar system allowed the US to wrack up unsustainable and impossible financial debts and export inflation to the rest of the world while keeping the prosperity at home. The fact that the GAE wasted that system on wars of choice and a MIC that can’t win a real war is a separate set of problems. The GAE we live under today is largely a result of the petrodollar, not Bretton Woods or the Marshall Plan or whatever.BRICS is a remains-to-be-seen.

                            Last time I touched COBOL was, um, 43 years ago, I think. Don’t even remember all that much about it, except that it was verbose enough to be self-documenting code.

            In the last 15years or so the US has gone from 40% of global GDP to 26%. In that same period, BRICS has gone from 18% to 36%.But accuse people of propaganda all you want. Reality has a way of biting those like you in the ass.

            I don’t care about anything other than money and the fact that they have been stealing from us through inflation since at least the last 15 years, but I would even go back to the tech stock bubble bursting under Clinton. It used to be you could earn money in the bank and the interest you received was to keep up with inflation with maybe a tiny bit extra. Nowadays, except for promotional rates, you get squat and they eat away at it through inflation.In other words, they’re forcing you to either live like South Americans in the old days and spend money before it loses value, i e not having anything, or putting your money in the market and taking risk, which not everybody is in a position to do.I care about how these idiocies affect my pocketbook.
