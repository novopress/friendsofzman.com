        I‚Äôm not a conspiracy theorist, BUT‚Ä¶. the very fact that it was a cock-up screams ‚ÄúHillary!‚Äù to me.  You said ‚Äúwell trained and qualified hit-men.‚Äù  What has that woman ever done that hasn‚Äôt been the babytown frolics?  As a frat buddy once said, she could screw up a wet dream.  It‚Äôd be just like her to send some nobody from the motor pool to rub out a whistleblower.  üôÇ

            The motor pool angle is possible, however the Clintons have been keen fans of hiring Canadians of a certain skill set for close to 40 years. Even Monsanto hires them to fly over and drop Round Up bombs on farm fields suspected of being planted with held-back seed, if no license fee was paid.Zman‚Äôs assertion is correct, the feral class calls it a night around 2 a.m. Doesn‚Äôt really matter if this death was ordered, or a random act of violence, a message was sent, and is being repeated by every news agency in the world.‚ÄúDon‚Äôt pick up the whistle!‚Äù

        It‚Äôs been my unfortunate experience dealing with and cleaning up after weasels who manage to live their entire lives getting away with everything, that these kind suffer from what I like to refer to as Teflon Syndrome. Nothing ever sticks so they never feel the need to be overly careful. Why bother? The reports will always be doctored and the conspiracy theories simply boost their ratings. The Clintons always float and apparently they always will for some reason we are not privileged to know. I‚Äôve always thought it was possibly that they have a little black book of interesting facts hidden somewhere in vault. That Hitlery was promised the presidency in 2008 if she would back off and let Obummer smooth the way for her, is not so much conspiracy theory as it is common sense.

        For others near the epicenter, perhaps a message was sent.  In other words, no evidence of a mugging could be akin to Luca Brasi sleepin‚Äô with da fishes.

            Kill the chicken to frighten the monkey. If a death is ambiguous, it always seems more ominous. Think of the effects of Vince Foster‚Äôs demise. Delivering a threat while keeping it plausibly deniable.

        The only mandatory part of a professional  hit is to not get caught or lead the Po Po to the person who commissioned the hit. By that standard this was a successful assassination.  If the victims was involved with a girl with a jealous boyfriend the detective‚Äôs will suss that out. If he had a drug habit they will learn of it.   They find NO REASON then the odds are it was a Clinton/DNC hit.  Nearly five dozen friends, associates and acquaintances of the Clintons have died since 1994. That doesn‚Äôt count the three dozen passengers on Ron Browns plane‚Ä¶.. collateral damage.  It is a statistical impossibility for these numbers to be a normal routine thing. The ONLY explanation is criminal conduct by and for the Clintons.

        Z:  Good conspiracy analysis, except that the Bloomingdale area in general, and the site of the murder in particular ‚Äî Flagler Pl. and W St., NW ‚Äî is still a s‚Ä¶hole, despite (or maybe because of) what clueless urban-lefty-hipster-DNC libtards believe.  I‚Äôve lived in NW DC for over 30 years and as a Normal White Guy I wouldn‚Äôt hang in Bloomingdale during the day unarmed, and would never be there on the street after dark even if carrying.  Too many hyenas on the prowl.

            Admittedly it has been a while since I was around there, but I thought it had spruced up a lot the last few years. I may be thinking of somewhere else, but that was my recollection. Keep in mind that I frequent some hard hitting ghettos so I may be judging on a curve.

        It might also be helpful to look at the Victim‚Äôs recent work or activities. Seth Rich has been identified as having been working on the DNC Voter Expansion Database. That sounds very much like a euphemism for vote  tampering or election fraud. If so, that could be a very real reason to silence known or suspected of becoming a ‚Äúsource‚Äù.

        Towards the end of the 90‚Ä≥s I‚Äôm sure insurance carriers were considering adding a question to life insurance applications something along the lines of:  Are you, or have you ever been  a friend, acquaintance, or business associate of Bill or Hillary Clinton.  If the answer was yes then the suicide exclusion would be for life, considering Vince Foster, Adm., Boorda, numerous bodies in AR, etc.

        Good points.  I thought of this too.  IF this was a hit, the whole point would be to make it appear to be anything but‚Ä¶  What I can see is though, he was roughed up , maybe a clean hit got spoiled‚Ä¶ he runs and the plan goes awry‚Ä¶ the only option becomes the shooting and for whatever reason, no time to make it look like robbery.  The main thing was to silence him.I don‚Äôt know.  I hate conspiracies.  Could have been completely random street violence.  But it is so very odd to have him killed right before the convention, when all the email stuff about the DNC was in the air‚Ä¶ and the UN guy who had a tragic weightlifting accident shortly before he was to testify‚Ä¶  curious indeed.

            ‚ÄúOn the other hand, murder for hire is not a pointless act. If you just want someone dead, then you want it to look like an accident or a street crime. Otherwise, you are bringing unnecessary attention to something you want to keep quiet.‚ÄùUnless you want to intimidate other people into keeping quiet and you know that if you are caught you won‚Äôt be prosecuted.Then you make it look like a hit, by leaving the victim with all of his valuables.

        An American friend of mine sent me this list of names the other day along with a long dissertation of the coincidences and circumstances of their deaths as related to the Clintons. While I can‚Äôt fully appreciate all these names, the links seem to be clear enough even to me.
James McDougal, Mary Mahoney, Vince Foster, Ron Brown, Victor Raiser, Paul Tulley, Ed Willey, Jerry Parks, James Bunch, James Wilson, Kathy Ferguson, Bill Shelton, Gandy Baugh, Florence Martin, Suzanne Coleman, Paula Grober, Danny Casolaro, Paul Wilcher, Jon Parnell Walker, Barbara Wise.

            To this list should be added Admiral Mike Boorda.  Late ‚Äô95 or early ‚Äô96 he wrote in a news letter to Navy retirees that the Tricare medical system being implemented was not what had been sold to the Joint Chiefs for their endorsement and that he was going to do all in his power to kill it.  I believe he communicated the same sentiment to active duty personnel.  May ‚Äô96 he ‚Äúsuicides‚Äù (shot twice through the chest with a .38 revolver at his residence on the Navy Yard) over what, to anyone in service, was a stupid issue.  Tricare, as then designed, was the prototype Hillarycare.As an aside I find it interesting that no one barking after the ‚ÄúVA Scandal‚Äù car in the road will even sniff at the obvious; that the VA medical system is the single-payer prototype and the future of medicine for dirt people.

        My two cents:  The story about the time of the killing has bothered me.  The official story is that the guy was at ‚Äúhis girlfriend‚Äôs apartment‚Äù and he left to go back to his place.  That seems weird to me.  Why not just stay the night and go back to your place when it‚Äôs light out.  Why leave at 4:30?
Now, what would make sense is if the guy left at that time because he was going to meet somebody.

        When I watch shows like The Wire, I speculate on how I would operate as a hit-man in an urban jungle.  I think I would use a pistol caliber rifle or carbine.  Your average 9mm carbine such as a Beretta Storm is accurate to 100+ yards and is easy to suppress.  There are lever-action rifles in .38 Special / .357 Magnum that would also be perfect ‚Äì and they wouldn‚Äôt spray the brass around.  Like this:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAfhOcL8QVYShoot the target a few times from a vehicle 100 yards away and be gone before the body hits the ground.  Meanwhile the cops go looking for a thug with an automatic or revolver.  Not robbing his stuff to make it look like street crime is the only draw-back.

            It depends upon your goals, but the mafia was fond of using a .32 ACP. A .22 used to be the favorite of the Mossad. The mafia put cloth or newspaper over the gun to make a cheap silencer. When you see the shooter in gangster movies with a newspaper over the gun it is in part to reduce the sound, but also the muzzle flash. The Mossad has high quality weapons so a silenced .22 is excellent for assassinations in public places. You could also go with the Bulgarian Umbrella if you have a flare for the exotic.

        There is no reason to beat around the bush.  This was a Clinton hit under the theory of cui bono?  I think they must have a whole stable of soldiers on the payroll just like a mafia family.  So many dead bodies all benefiting the C‚Äôs.  Do ou think JFK, Jr was rubbed out too?  It was afterall beneficial to the Clintons.

        I don‚Äôt necessarily believe that the Clintons did this, but I wouldn‚Äôt put it past them.
As incompetent, arrogant and greedy as the Clintons are, would it be hard to believe that they hired the cheapest hitman that they could find, believing that they wouldn‚Äôt be caught no matter what? If the guy screwed it up, so what? They‚Äôre never held to account for anything.

        Add into the death of this democratic voter outreach guy another one shortly following the email dump by WikiLeaks. The guy who filed suit against the DNCe and Hillary campaign was serving his papers ‚Äì he too is dead ‚Äì shot!? What gives? Thinking about the ex-UN employee that was to testify against Hillary and voila ‚Äì he strangely died by the weights he lifted crushing his trachea. Yet ‚Äì he worked out daily without any issues until the day prior to his schedule to be deposed involving Hillary ‚Äì he too is dead. That was one months ago!There are sure a few people dying these days that are all connected with the Hillary campaign. Strange no? So far ‚Äì the count is 4 in just one months!

            Holy crap!  I had not heard about this one but found it easily enough with a search.  No way the guy in that picture kills himself with a barbell without a lot of help.  It‚Äôs like they‚Äôve stopped trying to hide in now ‚Äì kind of scary.

        Why people in this day and age can pretend that large scale conspiracies don‚Äôt exist is beyond me. On 9-11 building #7, not hit by a plane, fell the same speed as a rock dropped in ‚Äúair‚Äù for roughly 108 feet. If the building fell as fast as the rock this means the density of material below it was the same or close. As in air. Well we all know the bottom of the building didn‚Äôt turn to air so by simple analysis we know the building was demoed. People somehow have the notion that big objects fall faster than small ones. Inaccurate. After all a big object is just a lot of small ones stuck together. Gravity operates the same on both. There‚Äôs tons and tons of evidence supporting the demo position but the biggest is that the bottom wasn‚Äôt made of air. It‚Äôs impossible for fires to make the building fall in such a manner. I haven‚Äôt even talked about the wackiness of the governments story for the other three buildings and the crash of a jet that don‚Äôt line up. I don‚Äôt have to building #7 shows that this was a set up by groups within the US government.

        The Ron Brown death was not a Clinton hit, directly.  It was a pay-to-play gone wrong IIRC due to DC hubris.  Word on the corporate street at the time was that a seat on one of his plane junkets was $100k to the DNC (Clinton Foundation came into being later).  Why pay_?  Dept of Commerce export support plus cred with foreign elites that partly obviates the need for the bribery that is the heart &amp; soul of the big project export business.Why Dubrovnik_?  A. Promised play day on the gorgeous Adriatic coast.  Airport was well below minimums, pilot went around once then, instead of diverting, went back and flew into a mountain in the fog.  Likely explanation: Brown put pressure on the AF pilot in command to push the landing and paid for it with his life, just like the President of Poland a few years ago.

Brown &amp; his marks were riding in a USAF (luxuriously outfitted) transport aircraft in 1996.  They all had dual GPS navigation by then.  If both GPS failed they would have reverted to VORTAC for IFR navigation back-up.  Next time you‚Äôre at an airport look for the station.  Usually displaced from the runways, near centrally located,  It‚Äôs ~ 12‚Ä≤ tall, ~ 10‚Ä≤ diameter at the base, roughly cone shaped, orange &amp; white stripes.  No chance it could have been moved to any mountain, much less surreptitiously.
