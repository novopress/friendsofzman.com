        It’s an interesting duality, with advertising taking on the role of Schrodinger’s cat, in that they say that it does and does not work. (It works in selling product, but it doesn’t work in influencing someone to do something negative.)Advertising is smoke, and that’s the way they like it.

        Uber is a cost shifting operation. Facebook and NetFlix are cost shifting operations.I wondered about how the above cost shift. NetFlix uses tons of bandwidth, thus shifting the cost onto everyone else who pays for access to the internet. Later, you wrote that Facebook has been accused of “using click farms”–which I guess means they’re generating phony clicks on advertisements, thus shifting costs to their advertisers. Is that right? (I despise Facebook. I strongly suspect they constantly change their security procedures so users cannot keep up, allowing FB to harvest personal information into huge lists that they sell.) Also, I’d bet FB, like NetFlix, does not pay for its share of bandwidth.What about Uber? How do they cost shift?

            Most “free apps” rely on ads. They charge the advertiser based on “impressions” which loosely means the number of times the ad is viewed. They will track the click throughs which is supposed to mean the number of times a user clicks on the ad. Obviously, an app with loads of intrusive ads is not getting used so they fake the ads and fake the clicks. This makes it appear that you are watching these ads and clicking on the content.The carriers have an incentive to look the other way as they charge you for minutes used. Heavy users will not notice that some percent of their minutes are being used for this scam. Instead they just buy the next level plan to avoid overage fees.

        For one of the experts: Does use of an ad blocker stop revenue generation for the ad “seller” (however that’s determined)?
