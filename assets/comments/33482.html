        Afraid that I might slight disagree with Derb. Phobia is an extreme or irrational fear of or aversion to something. Whites concerns about importing a famously clannish and unlawful people such as the Indians seems more than rational. If anything, we are drifting toward a reasonable Indo-awareness.
It’s bad enough to import an underclass. It’s madness to import a hostile and wholly incompatible overclass. If a few uncouth remarks are made by the white unwashed on the way toward an immigration moratorium, I can live with that.

            Yeah, that was a strange comment. His use of phobia was in the vein of how progs use it – disagreement equals fear. Which is silly.

        I’m glad you found a church to suit your tastes. The prolonged death of the Episcopal Church of the United States of America (ECUSA) is a topic that evinces scowls from most of us who grew up in it. Things really kicked off in the 1990s. It went from being the premier church of these United States (of which boasted the strongest amount of US presidents among the denominations), to being a country club for disaffected upper and upper middle class types, to being museums “infrequented” by anybody other than the odd cat ladies who signed over large portions of their wealth to fund the endowments of the churches and never seemed to put two and two together when they saw the “vicar” (as you might refer to him) and his very nice male friend holding hands and kissing one another on the cheek. That’s your explanation for why they haven’t quite gone “broke” yet. Their coffers are set to run dry around the time as Harvard, which might outlive this Republic. A Takimag commentator who went by “Celestia Questia” once jokingly referred to MIT as the “Monrovia Instatoot O’ Thuggery.” Perhaps Harvard and the ECUSA will adopt similar monikers as the lights of the Republic flicker and fade, excepting perhaps Divine intervention and the awakening ire of the inhabitants of this nation in the fashion of another Kipling poem.Most of us with sense and a commitment to the liturgy we were raised in departed for the “Continuing Anglican” pastures, whether it was for the Anglican Church of North America, the Anglican Province of America, or any of the various other splinter factions. Many of them are humbled to the point of renting out building space from Baptists (an arrangement that both parties find distasteful). Most Episcopal Churches have placed in their bylaws a commitment to sell their buildings to Muslims and other interlopers before they would entertain selling it to a Continuing Anglican church. In previous decades, parishes who left ECUSA had to engage in lengthy legal battles to maintain control of the building which the parishioners funded, with many losing the building to the ECUSA who, as opposed to the other traditions they jettisoned, maintained an elite cadre of lawyers who enforced bylaws that insisted that the denomination owned the property rather than the congregants. These confounding factors have largely relegated orthodox Anglicanism in America to beggary. If that sounds dire, I’d caution you not to read about the state of the Anglican church in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and other commonwealth nations. I’m sure you’re aware of its status in the United Kingdom. In the US, we apparently have it “good” as opposed to our sister nations in the Anglosphere. How’s that for a “legacy?” The “papists and dissenters” seem to have achieved their goal of destroying the Church of England, but it’s been a pyrrhic victory for them and the celebration seems to occur mostly in the mosques, synagogues, and temples of the interlopers. I echo David’s lament in 2 Samuel: “How the mighty have fallen.”

            The main thing I miss is the lovely old Anglican hymns. I still sing them when driving my car alone. Baptists have nothing that compares, although we very occasionally get one of the oldies.
A lesser thing I miss is hearing the Lord’s Prayer prefaced with “we are bold to say…” (Cranmer’s translation of ‘audemus dicere’).

                I wish that the Episcopal priest who presided over the inauguration defaulted to the prayer of the BCB1928, which is surely just and adequate.“O Lord our Governor, whose glory is in all the world: We commend this nation to thy merciful care, that, being guided by thy Providence, we may dwell secure in thy peace.Grant to the President of the United States, and to all in authority, wisdom and strength to know and to do thy will.Fill them with the love of truth and righteousness, and make them ever mindful of their calling to serve this people in thy fear; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, world without end.”Of course that would have probably lit several purple hairs alight in the gathered community. I find it discouraging that Tucker Carlson still attends Episcopal services, as well as Neil Gorsuch. There are a few brave parishes in the Episcopal church who dare to thumb their nose at New England, but they are few and far between. I wish them well.I’m an admirer of Cranmer myself, as well as Richard Hooker, Thomas Cromwell and John Jewel. My wife and I finished the initial series of “Wolf Hall” and enjoyed it immensely. They portrayed Anne as quite piggish and antagonistic to the point you were rooting for the ending you knew would happen. You don’t see the BBC making television like that anymore, and it’s regrettable. It was a gasp of fresh air when Netflix commissioned “The King” as a retelling of Shakespeare’s Henry V. Even if you’re a Saxon at heart who hates the Normans, these are worth a watch.

        RE: Derb’s “take” on “The “Bishop-Lady of D.C.
Not all (bull)dykes are lesbians (i.e. (strictly) homosexual females), and likewise, not all (exclusively) same-sex oriented females fall under the traditional notions of “d yke.”
It’s complicated – absent patriarchy, STRANGE things happen to female psychology.
Anyway, your instincts “told you true,” the fact that she’s got a (presumably) male consort and offspring notwithstanding.
Best to all….

        … I am very partial to opera as part of the great Western cultural heritage package so neglected today. The Derb won my heart in many ways long time ago but that the word opera should be mentioned in a serious manner has endeared him and Z to me doubly …

        An adventure it was!  No place to camp, in the face of an oncoming arctic storm, in the wee-est and coldest hours!And here is our intrepid adventurer boldly setting forth with naught a care!Neither a bit of sense nor an ounce of fear.  Only his book, his tuxedo, and the heedless enthusiasm of youth.  Sturdy, that one.  As they say, ignorance and confidence are a sign of sure success.Many of the leftward-leaning noted with glee the small size of Trump’s first inaugural crowd.  It turns out the city was deliberately locked down then, too, an armed camp.It was so difficult to attend most of the crowd simply gave up, or were strongly discouraged.I see that Mr. Derb is Anglican in his sympathies; the only Anglican I’ve met was from a boys’ school in the Yukon.  Cheerful, Canadian, one realized after a time that this wiry lad was hard as nails.  It was a private school very much in the Anglican sense, offering adversities harder than anything found in New York’s Hell’s Kitchen; their graduation showed the type of men it would mold.The boys would be taken 200 kilometres into the Yukon outback; there, they were given a canoe and an oar.  They were then told to find their way back on their own, and bid adieu.(He did mention an honorary wall for the fallen; they lost one every couple of years.)Is it any wonder these genial fellows conquered the world, incidentally at that.  They did when they weren’t even trying to.

        In part-3 above, I like that list of 19 Executive Orders, signed on Jan 20. I especially like the 8th one; “Revoked 78 of Joe Biden’s Executive Orders.” Good riddance.
Never would I visit DC – for any reason, and certainly not for pleasure. It is full of crime, corruption and degeneracy. Like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it is definitely a place to avoid

        OT:
We can forget about reindustrializing if the SCOTUS is going to come up with complete garbage rulings like this:
