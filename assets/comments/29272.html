        We St. Louisans, native and otherwise, presuming we are of the compatible political bent, happily claim PJB as one of our own.  And he has always considered St. Louis his second home.  In fact, in 1996, after Bob Dole pretty much clinched the nomination, Missouri was PJB’s only win.  I was a few weeks away from turning 19 on caucus day, and I was proud to be part of that.I should say that theSt. Louis Globe-Democratwas never a liberal newspaper.  It was always mainstream conservative biased since at least the 1920s all the way until its folding in 1986.

        Ran into this post over at the WRSA site. Some particulars are concerning Canada, but overall this post is of interest to all of us North American wypipo. Communist Chinese policies and actions coming to fruition. Worth a read.

            Being familiar with the Gulf of Tonkin, the Maine, and WMD, among other Current Thing scams, I’m having a hard time getting real worked up about a balloon.
That’s the best they can come up with now? A balloon? Talk about decline. Their scams used to be more audacious.

                Jeff,
The balloon thing was not the reason that I thought this post worthy of note; rather, it was the second through the fifth links contained within it documenting highly suspect actions of the Canadian government violative of national security/ sovereignty interests, rationally considered.

        I remember the 1992 election well. A few co-workers and I were speaking about it and they all agreed that Bush with an over 90 percent approval rating after the Gulf War could not lose. Enter Ross Perot.Perot was the reason Clinton won, and throughout the election Perot only attacked Bush and took votes from him, allowing the Clintons to slither in. I’m not saying Bush was an outstanding guy, but I’m not sure he would have provoked any more overseas wars if re-elected. He did pull out of Iraq at the end of the 1991 war and never occupied all of the country as the neocons wished. The best choice was actually Perot, but he didn’t stand a chance to win.Buchanan never had a chance but it would have been awesome if the guy was elected President. I knew a couple who saw him speak in 1996 on the campaign trail and they said he was incredible.

        Nixon- One of the worst modern day presidents and the primary” irony of witch turned saint through murkiness of time”. His alignment with Conservatism (that wretched ideology) whether strong or weak only adds to his detraction. He was a militant Civil Rights enforcers and one the right wing fathers of the two pronged “lesser of two evils” strategy combined with shock and awe infiltrate, crush, and ostracize rival ideologies while feigning sympathy. One solace I take is how hated Nixon and his legacy are by the regime he faithfully served.The paleocon movement has as a seat at the tables next to every other failed ideology  outside of Liberalism and Conservatism, the no effecting real change or holding power club. Though I’m increasingly skeptical paleoconservatism ever was more than the happy little dupe playing the part for Conservatism’s “RINO” framework.

        Great show Z, thanks a lot. I enjoyed reliving my political youth and reminiscing on how Buchanan really *was* everywhere up until his renegade campaign.
You also jogged my memory of Jerry Brown’s parallel 1992 run, when for a moment I had the delusion of there possibly being a a Left/Right populist movement against the regime and the havoc it was wreaking on normal people. It’s a good reminder that the Left was not yet as insanely leukophobic as it is now.

            Those Jerry Brown-Bill Clinton debates were fantastic.  Brown had Clinton on the ropes, until he was told to step back.

        I’m a Boomer, 10 years older than you, and Pat was a major influence on all us young conservatives in the late 1970s, then throughout our lives. We read the columns and watched TV shows. Then we cheered when he went to work for Reagan. Later, we supported all three presidential campaigns. Anti-communists, we also joined him in opposing the 1990-01 Gulf War and all the other wars since. Pat also has been a major pro-life leader. I remember in his 96 campaign he came up with the idea that a Republican president should just announce Roe v. Wade was unconstitutional, and he wouldn’t support it; which would have thrown the matter back to the states long before the Supreme Court did so last year. His books remain a treasure, especially the memoirs. “Right from the Beginning” describes the America he loved, growing up in a large Catholic family in the 1950s, getting in lots of arguments and fistfights. I hope he publishes a final volume of memoirs on his Reagan years. A unique and great American who fought the good fight to the end.

        I remember very well Pat Buchanan.I was a 24yo french guy, interested in politics. Because I was center-left in 92, I didn’t listen about him, but I started my way to the right two years later, and I followed is 96 campaign.Before Trump, Buchanan was the only one US politician quite exciting. I have to admit I never understood why US people get crazy about Bush vs Gore or Obama vs McCain. View from the east side of the Atlantic Ocean, they were the same.Protectionism created the wealth and power of America (southerners were certainly more civilized, but they bring to the US 2 plagues : millions of Africans and free-trade dogma.Protectionism made US, Kaiser Germany (and, next century, Japan or Korea), while Britain create herself her slow decline with the Dogma’s worshipping.The true right can only be an alliance between common people and a leader. Generally, this process arrives when the middle class is crushed.Of course, republican-democratic right or dictatorship right fail, because they lived in an organic leftist world (the world of democratic, parlementarian Republics).Dictatorships were crushed by the alliance between conservatives, liberals and communists.But if they had won, they would have failed into a leftist come back, after the unavoidable bureaucratic evolution of party-regime. We would have saw a nazi Brezhnev.I don’t know how and when the right will kill the left, but I’m quite sure than, if this rightist revolution don’t bring back a monarchy (adapted to our times), it would fall too.The french historian I read actually (comte de Vaublanc, “mémoires sur la Révolution française”, give us a precious method.Vaublanc was a living witness of 1789, of Napoléon, of the 1815 Bourbons restauration and of the fall of them 15 years later.He noticed rhan the fall always came from concessions to the left.Vaublanc didn’t meant than a rightist power shouldn’t provide reforms, but than those reforms should have to be ALWAYS an action, a rightist initiative, and never a reaction to left’s noise.(This advice is, I know, totally needless in our horrific times of absolute leftist triumph, but could be useful in the future)My TLDR : the holy founding father of Conservatism is Louis XVI(“Conservatism” in the meaning of RINO, center-right, etc.)

            If protectionism is so effective why is France such a dump? Operation Sentinelle is still underway.
If protectionism is part of a confident and productive culture then your country will thrive but if it’s a vain attempt to shield your decrepit tribe from a vigorous foreign culture then you will fall . France is an example of this.

            No the first step is to talk about your own red pill ingestion. These are our stories of awakening.My first was only a partial pill. I kept wondering why Republicans kept trotting out such mediocrities. The first Bush. Dole. Bush II. McCain. Huh?I got another partial dose when Bush II won his second term and had the house and the senate. Here we go. Conservative heaven. But nope. We got another entitlement (prescription drug), more centralization of education, a rules of engagement war in the middle east that put the bravest Americans in unnecessary risk, and the looting of America through financial collapse.Another partial red pill happened every time we had to raise the debt ceiling. Each episode was like the movie Groundhog Day. The government would start by laying off nonessential workers. This meant that they got paid leave, usually around Christmas, while the rst of us had to work for a living. Depressed within interview these beleaguered bureaucrats. The bureaucrats would wonder how they were going to buy their kids Christmas presents. Not once did anyone ask why we needed nonessential workers in the first place. When I heard about the need for an agreement to raise the debt ceiling, I assumed we had this awesome lever to roll back big government hard.I also wondered why we decided to start importing so many Muslims after 911.My final dose of red pill came when Trump swept in the office. I voted for Trump because I agreed with every one of his policies that he ran on. I thought he was a blowhard flamethrower, but that was better than the milquetoasts we had gotten. And he got both the House and the Senate. I thought, oh boy, we’re gonna build a wall. We’re gonna stop all the crazy outsourcing to China. We’re going to bring our troops home for the Middle East. We’re going to repeal and replace Obamacare.That’s when I woke up. Now, it is hard for me to see why so many are on the other side of the great divide. Things are much worse than ever. We want to defend the sacred borders of Ukraine and have no border at all for ourselves. We’re printing more money than ever and taxing the middle class in the blue-collar workers with crazy inflation. We’re risking nuclear war over nothing. Depressed has become a propaganda organ. Free speech is under attack. Show trial a plenty. Non-sense like gender confusion is called science. We worship a race of stupid violent people whose greatest contribution to culture is gangsta rap. Both courses of reasonable opposition to violent stupid people are illegal: not associating with them or throwing them in jail.

        The events of the last 8 or so years would seem to show that accusing the President of being a “Russian asset” is a pretty good strategy.
Typical conservatives: throw away your weapon, congratulate yourself on your honor and virtue.
BTW: story is that the doltish Ike became president of Columbia University because they had wanted his brother, Milton, an actual educator, and some intern called the wrong number.
Speaking of sauce for the gander: “Anathematization of Pat Buchanan.” How ironic: they did to him exact what he and his Church wanted to do to them. Boo hoo.

            Okay, let’s play that game. You are fine with it happening to Buchanan because you feel he deserved it, but if he and his church had won would it have been equally fine? Is discrimination acceptable when it’s the revenge of a group you feel is oppressed? It seems to me that it should be all or none, but many people, in this modern age, feel like they are qualified to determine who it is acceptable to oppress.

        I was more of a Mike Royko  guy.Ed Anger a decade later.Had no idea Ed anger was done by a Canadian lady. John derbyshire was her friend and gave a very nice tribute to her.IMO the weekly world news had far more credibility than all the birdcage liners put together.

        Gen X here. Dude, Joan Jett was 14 in 1972. Nobody had ever heard of her yet. She was basically a nobody until the ’80s. I don’t disagree with you about the boomers, but you gotta get your rock-n-roll trivia straight before you start dissing on an entire generation.

        I grew up in a working class town in Massachusetts.  The dad’s of most of my friends worked in one of the local factories.  It was such a nice town.  Pat’s down-to-earth Catholic conservativism was so recognizable to me.  Conservative Democrat Governor Ed King was saying much the same thing.
I go back to visit and hate the place.  The biggest factory was demolished and is now a shopping center.  The working class is simply gone, replaced with liberal assholes and Indian tech workers.

            Out went the factories, in came the opiods and the meth. And right on the heels of Reagan’s Big Amnesty. Whether or not there was some master plan to this assault on heartland white America, it couldn’t have worked much better if there had been.The other day I saw a heat map of opiod overdose deaths over the years and it was concentrated most heavily in Appalachia and Missouri/Ozarks. And I thought about not just how many died, but about the offspring they might have had, the lives they might otherwise have led.I’m pretty sure the reason some places had lots of pill mills and others had few or none wasn’t just random.

                The pharma family that created those opiods had a clear plan of who to market and sell them too. It is blood curdling to find their statements. Repurcussions despite this? Leftists making T-Shirts calling for their heads? No. They enjoy a life of luxury in Cosmopolitan Capitals and use the money to donate their real homeland and preferred people.

                Jeffrey Zoar: “Out went the factories, in came the opiods and the meth… I’m pretty sure the reason some places had lots of pill mills and others had few or none wasn’t just random.”We all know about the Early Life of the Sackler Family Crime Syndicate.But did you know about the Early Life of Brian Cranston?It’s still there, but apparently the sh!tlib NPCs at Wikipedia have removed the obvious external HTML “anchors” to “Early Life”, so you have to delve into the code to find the deep link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Cranston#Early_life==========Speaking of greater Appalachia, I’ve been convinced for decades now that the reason we got anti-smoking and anti-fossil-fuel campaigns in this country was to cripple the economic fortunes of the Scots-Irish of greater Appalachia, who tended to work in tobacco or coal [or textiles or furniture], because by 1960ish, the Frankfurt School behavioral psychologists would have accumulated abundant empirical data proving that the Scots-Irish were doggedly immune to the Mind Virus, and the Frankfurt School realized that the Scots-Irish would have to be cut off at the knees financially.Oddly enough, the last mainstream politician to speak out against the Frankfurt School’s drive to destroy greater Appalachia was Dick Gephardt, DEM-Missouri, House Majority Leader from 1989 to 1995, who led the opposition to NAFTA, and who tried to preserve the livelihoods of all the Scots-Irish workers in the old textile &amp; furniture mill towns.[Within the last few months here chez Z, we were talking about vintage 1980s 100% Cotton clothing milled in the USA, and how its value is soaring in the “vintage” clothing market; similar trends are being seen in the “Mid-Century Modern” furniture market.]But by 2009, Gephardt had thrown in the towel and had become a lobbyist for Goldman Sachs and the Chamber of Commerce.https://harpers.org/2009/03/dick-gephardt-from-nafta-foe-to-the-us-chamber/It’s so sad.But their perfidy does allow us to do what will need to be done with clear &amp; clean consciences.George Soros of course moved in and purchased up all the old coal mines for pennies on the dollar, so that he could EXPORT our coal to China, and laugh all the way to the bank.There’s always an Early Life in there somewhere.==========PS: Gunslingergregi, if you see this, WE LOVE YOU, BRO!!!!![Gunny was on the front lines of the Sackler Family warfare campaigns, and he witnessed the corpses stacking up in the morgues.Gunny was a literal canary in the coal mine.]

                    Cranston was just on Bill Maher’s show this week sticking up for crt in schools.
He’s respected by younger whites because he pretended to be a tough guy drug dealer for a make believe tv show.
It’s hard not to be hopeless when looking at a true statement like that.

        A small example of what has been lost. A while back I was watching a YouTube video about Jim Morrison, singer from the band The Doors, being arrested for exposing himself on stage during a concert in Miami in 1969. The thing that I remember most was the interviews with city and law enforcement officials. They were White guys with Southern accents. Apparently, at least through 1969, Miami still had a White Christian power structure. For decades, Southerners have derisively referred to as Bible thumpers and Holy Rollers.  What I saw in these videos were men trying to maintain the moral standards of their community. Where do you think would be a nicer place to live 1969 Miami or 2023 Miami.

            The Miami of the Jackie Gleason era was a different world.  There a a few big cities that today young people consider desirable places to live.  Two that I hear a lot about are Nashville and Austin.  It won’t be long before diversity gets to those cities.

            I don’t think the white flight north to Broward and Palm Beach Counties really hit full steam until the 1980s. On the heels of the Mariel boatlift. Now Broward is steadily going the same way as Dade and you’re even starting to see a few Cubans up in Boca Raton.

            What is the better chance of being arrested: exposing yourself during a music performance, in any big city.
Or, exposing your political or social views, especially regarding certain minorities.
Not that I’m encouraging racisms on stage, but let’s say I’d rather hear Kramer shout the N-word, than see his penis.

            It is seriously depressing. I was actually -IN- Miami not long ago and was driving through it circa 2023. When I got back to my hotel a documentary came on talking about how the city came to be and some deep history. Seeing that place in the 50s and 60s with all the golden haired blondes walking around and 90% white and then looking out my window at the barrio and the graffiti and the Cubana music blaring. Jesus, what a difference.

        Buchanan, a civnat paleocon, demonstrated that civnat paleocons are just as defenseless as libertarians. There’s nothing much ideologically wrong with civnats, paleocons, and libertarians IMO, but they are defenseless against enemies who work within those systems.Nativism and nationalism must be first principles against which no opposition can be tolerated. All political opposition must work within, not against, those principles, or else the nation is sooner or later doomed to decline and fail. Perhaps it is doomed to decline and fail anyway, but absent those principles it is guaranteed. Which is music to the ears of the “citizens of the world” who are too dumb to understand that the nation is the only thing which can guarantee rights, freedoms etc. It was good while it lasted, back when 90% of the population give or take were civnats themselves.If Reagan hadn’t signed the Big Amnesty, then the next guy would have. Or the next guy. Speaking of the next guy, I understand Reagan’s first choice as running mate in 1980 was Rumsfeld, but they talked him out of that in favor of GHWB. In that alternate history, I doubt much changes with respect to the ascent of the neocons, but Rumsfeld, being a much more charismatic figure than GHWB, potentially defeats Clinton (and Perot) when his time comes as the top guy. I dunno whether or not he gives us NAFTA. Probably.Continuing with the alternate history, but for Donna Rice we’d have probably had President Gary Hart instead of GHWB. In an early foreshadowing of clown world, womanizing that sank Hart would, a mere 4 years later, roll off of Clinton like water off a duck’s back. But this suggests that Hart was a decent man who felt shame, since he dropped out himself, he wasn’t forced out. Nobody could ever make a Clinton feel shame.

            It is doomed to fail in the natural cycles of nations and civilizations. The problem with what the current crop of failures have done, is to do their best to ensure that the people of the homeland won’t be there to rebuild it and start a new cycle.I think that is the project that Z-Man is advocating for. I also think that is the crux of the debate between Anton and Z-Man. Anton doesn’t think that a people make a nation. He thinks the ideological abstractions make it. He thinks if the abstraction is gone the nation is gone. There may be some truth to that in the sense that a given order or form will be gone or altered. Z-Man is saying the people are the nation. The people are the natural preservationists of the nation and its ideals – they embody them by nature. The form followed the nature of the people who created it. If the ideological abstraction fails to serve the nation or the people, then what has precedence is the preservation of the people, not the ideological abstraction.Anton further refuses to acknowledge that the ideological abstraction he places before the people has long since been replaced by other ideological abstractions. Natural rights were long ago replaced with Positive Rights. Since those rights don’t come from nature, they are gone when they are gone when citizens minds are replaced by the minds of border inhabitants.Anton may still hold the abstractions in his mind, but the regime replaced that abstraction and then embarked upon replacing the people. Z-Man further argues that you must look to reality to see if the ideological abstraction is preserved if you replace the people. It seems that what we are dealing with is that both the abstraction and the people have been replaced – the former completely the latter a work in progress.Pat Buchanan saw that as clear as day and said so plainly and clearly. Watching that video I wept when he spoke about the small town Americans decimated by globalism and off-shoring. You could feel his genuine sorrow and love of the people of the countryside. You could feel it too in his recounting of the restoration of LA in the face of the riots. He clearly said it was cultural. To see a man who clearly loved the people and the nation speak like that with hope is a bitter sorrow.We should never forget that such a man who loved his people and his country would be so callously and viciously attacked by the lizards. We should not let hate and anger consume us, but we should hold a healthy hate and contempt for those who did what they did to Buchanan and the paleos. For what they did to Pat Buchanan they did to our country and they did to us – with plans for much worse to come. We must hold onto that contempt but not be blinded by it. Rather we must hold it to remind us who we are dealing with and what must be done to overcome their misanthropic contempt for us.With the country gone, to what do we attach our hearts? I weep as I write this. It is a brutal and terrible crime that has been done against us. It broke Buchanan’s heart. But, there is no time for weeping. As surely and in the same cold-blooded psychopathy as the abstractions and then the nation were eradicated our people are being eradicated too.Therein is our answer to what do we attach our hearts to now that our nation is gone? Our hearts must follow the heart of Pat Buchanan. They must be attached with a deep affection to the primordial bond of blood to our people. That is the only way we are going to survive in any way that is meaningful and that has any hope of honoring the ancestors who survived so much to get us here, and for our people who will survive us into the future.

                PeriheliusLux: “The form followed the nature of the people who created it.”That was literally the point of view of the early settlers in the colonies, as they wrote their parish &amp; township &amp; county &amp; state “constitutions” [prior to writing the ultimate federal constitution]: That a “constitution” was a description of that which CONSTITUTED the nature of the colonists.That they were, by their very constitution, of the nature to be allowed to* Worship freely, without any fear that they would worship Gog or Magog or Moloch or Ol’ Scratch Hisself;* Speak freely, without any fear that they would spread lies or half-truths about one another;* Keep and bear arms [and @mmunit!on], without any fear that they would wantonly murder one another;* Serve as jurors in trials of capital offenses, without any fear that they would deliver false verdicts;And so on &amp; so forth…Our Consititution was simply a description of the nature of the people who were to be governed by it.[Or it least it was after the Anti-Federalists put their collective foot down and demanded that it be thus.]

                Anton and his pal Charles Haywood pretend they are on the dissident right, but what they really advocate is a take over of the empire and repurposing the managerial class to the task of doing natural rights and classical liberalism correctly.That’s the whole schtick of Red Caesar. They want to force the “left” out of power (sounds good) and then corral the dissident right towards more “moral” ends, some of which are admirable, but that also include the ideal colorblind society where we put all of our differences aside and focus on space travel or something like that.On Haywood’s recent appearance on the Subversive podcast with Alex Kaschuta, he said he believes that blacks still deserve emancipation and would “have no truck” with those who advocate for whites being in power — how conservative and definitely not dissident.The dissident train has left the station and all these posers are fighting to be conductor.

        As someone who’s posted on here before about his experiences as a Buchanan staffer in 1992 and 1996, I have to applaud Z Man for this episode and his thoughts.For the younger guys out there — and I was young in the 1990s — let me just add one thing: we already knew it was lost. Even in December 1991 in New Hampshire, as we went door to door in subzero temps with Pat’s Stars and Bars-themed posters and bumper stickers, we knew we were up against institutions that we couldn’t take down in one or two attempts. The aim was to damage them, and we did. The idea was that we’d continue wearing them down into the 2000s, and Pat was still powerful and energetic enough to lead that effort.Two things happened: Lenora Fulani, and then, 9-11. The former was Pat’s mistake, and the latter…well, we couldn’t do anything about that. We lost an entire decade while the US regime reconstituted itself. On September 12, 2001, as I walked around my very liberal northern city talking to left-wing peaceniks who wanted to nuke Kabul, I realized it was over, at least for this historical period. It was a few hundred million against tens of thousands, if that.Sometimes, the man doesn’t match with his times. The time was out of joint after 9-11, and so was Pat, and so were we.

        Wonderful podcast, thank you. Not selfish at all. It was so nice to be reminded of those great times. My dad was quite fond of Buchanan. He had my dad at his Zulus in Northern VA comment. Buchanan’s books are fundamental reading.I have so much more respect and admiration for Buchanan than I ever could for Trump so it seems strange to connect them. Buchanan is a true gentleman. Trump is brazen and obnoxious. But Trump did manage to re-open that door. Maybe, somehow it had to take a ridiculous person like Trump to expose not only the broken system but their eternal, visceral hatred of White Christian men.

        “Losing with honor” is still losing. To “lose with honor” simply means following the rules. But our enemy follows no rules but the dictates of power. He will do anything to maintain himself in the halls of the ruling elites. He will kill our children and sodomize any survivors. He will toss us in gulags, starve us to death, poison us, raid our homes, assassinate us in the street and murder us in our beds. He knows no law but the law of the jungle, a beast whose actions are red in tooth and claw. He will win until we stop obeying the law. And that means civil war. It must be war to the knife. We must understand that our enemy is a rabid animal who will never, ever, stop. To eliminate rabies, you kill the dog.I do not wish my tombstone to read, “He followed the law.” I want it to read, “He won.”

            Civil war may indeed by necessary. But there is one other possibility. As AINO collapses under the weight of its own irrationality, and as its power wanes both domestically and abroad, centrifugal forces will be unleashed that allow outlying regions–primarily the mountain west–to become de facto independent territories. If I am right, we won’t have to wade through rivers of blood, we’ll just have to keep our heads above water until AINO dies of exhaustion.

                I cannot see the Washington elites just standing by as parts of the US fracture off and go their separate ways. This would certainly lead to civil war. There is precedent, yes?Another possibility is an external shock to the system that it would cease to function as a viable threat to Liberty. An economic collapse would not do this, but a terrific military defeat certainly would. An American defeat and retreat from Europe or Asia—or both—tens of thousands of body bags containing dead US soldiers and the US forced to abandon NATO and cede Hawaii to the Chinese: these are all possibilities.

                    It would be less a case of Washington elites standing idly by, and more a case of them being helpless to do anything about it. Washington’s power will almost inevitably weaken, and the people of the hinterlands will sense it.

                        The issue then would be that the elites would not recognize their impotence, and therefore would engage in hostilities anyway. History is full of such instances.
Nonetheless, their power would be forever gone. Sometimes ruling classes cannot learn but from ghastly military defeats and submitting to the guillotine.

                    Wars in the ancient world were often elimination wars with entire populations enslaved or killed. Christianity humanized war by making it a contest between different princes for territory within Christendom.Most wars today are not eliminationist wars where one fears losing everything in the case of defeat and will fight to the last man. Instead – they become a calculation of “how much do I care to keep fighting?”When the US ZOG regime increasingly recruits what are essentially mercenaries and foreigners, this test of will in the desire to continue the conflict or abandon it becomes decisive and the regime managerial class will quickly find themselves without soldiers. Schmitt correctly mocked liberalism for being unable to command the Machiavellian lion (as opposed to fox) type of element of rule necessary to possess the dignity and majesty of the ruler of a state.“Were a world state to embrace the entire globe and humanity, then it would be no political entity and could only be loosely called a state. If, in fact, all humanity and the entire world were to become a unified entity based exclusively on economics and on technically regulating traffic, then it still would not be more of a social entity than a social entity of tenants in a tenement house, customers purchasing gas from the same utility company, or passengers traveling on the same bus. An interest group concerned exclusively with economics or traffic cannot become more than that, in the absence of an adversary.” -Carl Schmitt, The Concept of the Political

            Mike…..spot on man! A profound observation I have copied and saved. Z–thank you! The overlords have destroyed the rules based society. There are no rules but theirs in an ever shifting quicksand. A majority of people are insane, mass formation, drugged, sated, driven to distraction, neuronal highways destroyed, IQ falling. The rulers will never let us go no matter what happens to them. They are Insane! Demented! Lust for chaos and destruction. The family in Enoch, Utah that was murdered by the insane father-5 kids, mother, step-mother, murdered by the father who then shot himself, that family was 5 miles up the road north of me. The evil destruction is sweeping everywhere. Here, children now look at their fathers and ask mommy Is Daddy going to kill us like the Enoch daddy? A good chunk of Mormons are on SSRI’s and anxiety meds.  How many of you have tranny kids or grandkids? One granddaughter has gone full tranny. Mormon friend has 2 tranny and furry grandkids. I didn’t have the heart to tell her what furries are up to. She’d melt. We either fight our way out or just bend the knee. They are too rage filled to let us go.

                “The rulers will never let us go no matter”That depends on their ability to recruit those willing to fight and die for them, which appears to be rapidly decreasing.Machiavelli warned about over reliance on mercenaries, whose loyalty is fickle.I am optimistic this regime will collapse within 50 years, most likely 25 with a proximate cause of the loss of reserve currency status and massive domestic inflation.

        As somebody about Sailer’s age, I can vouch for this. I can accept that the America that I grew up in and loved is dead, but it’s very hard emotionally to admit that it’s never coming back, especially since, for a while there, it DID seem to be coming back.  Hence the Reagan nostalgia so common among so many of my fellow “Generation Jones” friends. But we need to be like sharks, swimming ever forward.

            I came of age in the 1980s in a place in the American South that probably wasn’t much different from what most of America had been like during the post war golden age. It was a great time and place to grow up. Even so, even there, by the time I was in my 30s I began to see that this was no longer the country they told me it was when I was growing up. And that was about 20 years ago. Never mind what all has happened since.So I don’t have much empathy for civnats who think it’s always 1985 and everything can be set right if they just vote harder. It seems like a product of willful blindness or stupidity.

                Yes, it is a kind of willful blindness, but it’s driven by the emotions I mentioned above. Understanding this can help people on our side of the divide reach people like that. It’s not just nostalgia, although there is plenty of that – it’s a weird kind of grief, mixed in with the guilty knowledge that somehow, we let it all slip away, and it’s never coming back. Some people, like you, come to that realization sooner than others.

        In the ’96 GOP primary, my hopes were sky-high after Pat Buchanan won the New Hampshire against Bob Dole and Lamar Alexander.  His anti-NAFTA, anti-mass immigration message was building momentum.  Then came Arizona.  It seemed like Buchanan could win there, but he didn’t.
I’ll always believe the establishment forces got nervous and engineered a Buchanan loss in Arizona.  It was a big disappointment but also eye-opening in understanding just how much nationalism threatens the elite.

            They did. We couldn’t even get in touch with local GOP chairs and county commissioners in South Carolina, where we thought we had the best shot and the most receptive audience. It was like coming up against an Eastern Bloc apparatus. Few wanted anything to do with Buchanan, because they were ordered by the RNC to shut us out.That’s when Pat realized that his Silent Generation’s trust in the Republican Party was misplaced, and led to his Reform Party dalliance. Pat was a writer and orator, not a party-builder, and the results were a disaster for everyone involved. In 2000, when he allowed the LaRouchites and Lenori Fulani to tag in, he was finished.

        Thank you. This was another nice take on a great man who has seen his influence only grow at life’s end.For me, Buchanan symbolized the separation of nationalism from so-called “conservatism.” Nationalism is in many ways post-ideological and is an embrace and love of one’s own people as the only philosophy that matters. By 1992, as you mention, the general loathing of Heritage America by the ruling class was open and undeniable. Here was Buchanan’s reaction:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2olwuAy3_og. The most important segment is near the end as Buchanan focuses on what is being done to Heritage America. Those nine or ten minutes have proved very prophetic.I supported Buchanan in 1992 not because I was a “conservative,” which even then was a ludicrous pose. I did not support him because of his Catholicism, which shaped so much of his world view. I did so because he was the rare voice for my people, who even then were under constant assault and had been since the end of World War II. The blood affinity is all that matters.As far as salvaging the United States, Buchanan came about thirty years too late. But he has, as you laid out, help blaze the trail for what follows next. He’s only left weekly column writing so let’s hope he writes his magnus opus before he leaves this world.Again, thanks.

This is true of a lot of the boomers.  They believe/hope that if the system produced that wonderful country once, it can do so again.  They have not made the connection that the population running that system had a lot to do with the results.  But they are halfway across the divide.

            The highest point of American civilization was between 1945 and 1965. Those marvelous, beautiful halcyon days are never coming back. The reason is that the intellectual, physical, spiritual and racial components that made that civilization no longer exist in the quantities needed to reconstruct it. It only survives in the pages of books and in the memories of old men.

                I keep pushing it to anyone who’ll listen, the best book I’ve ever read about this era is Golden Dreams by Kevin Starr. It is a magnicent book about what has to be the best time and place ever. Contrast California then with now. It’s horrible that a place could fall that far in relatively little time.

                        Life in San Francisco in the late 80s was still pretty cool. 1994 was the nadir – still a frontier town with the hippies still a fringe, but the wild and individual and unique American spirit. It was cool when it met the spirit of the GenX music and art that had real edge. Silicon Valley too was radically different in culture and people.The transformation that took place just from 1996 to 1998 was an unbelievable shock. I remember thinking, Who are these people and where did they come from? In those days, they were all whites, but they were the aliens that became our elites. By 2005 I was ashamed to have friends from Europe come and visit. I could never explain to them what had been lost.I hope that younger generations make the chance to create new towns where they can experience something other than this supercilious rabble and its bugman consumer culture where diversity means yummy food trucks and hating your own people and degrading yourself to lessen the contempt that those who are not your kind express toward you.

                        @PL:I had the great fortune to work abroad in East Asia as a young man in the Eighties. My first stop in the mainland always was San Francisco. It was absolutely the most vibrant, beautiful and interesting city in the world at that time and my heart raced as I landed there–for good reasons. Fast forward a few decades, long settled back home in the South, and I return there. Dear God. It truly was a different country and a horrible one, Dante’s Inferno with great scenery.Ditto Australia, maybe times ten. I went there for R&amp;R a lot in the Eighties. It truly was an awesome place. Fast forward more than 30 years and upon landing I was horrified. It had gone from Britain of old/Southern California of old to a totalitarian meth lab inhabited by mystery meat harpies.You might be able to go home again, maybe, but neither of those places if you recollect any aspect of them before they became hellscapes. To quote Peter Brimelow about Britain, whoever did that to those two places need to die by fire.

                True. If I could go back to any year in American history, it would be 1962, Cuban missile crisis be damned. And my parents had not even met in 1962. I’m nostalgic for a world I never actually knew.

                    I’d like to be able to go back to California from about 1965 to 1975. By the 70s the decline was well on it’s way but it was still a wonderland. I like to watch old tv and movies from that era and see what it was like. I know it isn’t real but still what it must have been. One of my favorite movies is Endless Summer, Bruce Brown’s homage to surfing. Look at the people and places, white, clean and beautiful lands.

        Back in my early 20’s when I wasn’t as astute politically as I am today, I couldn’t understand why the garden variety republicans were so upset at Buchanan. Two friends of mine who were a bit older than me and who are both devout Catholics explained that Buchanan was trying to get us out of all of the overseas entanglements that the neocons – the first time I ever heard the term – have gotten us into. They also went on about how Pat knew the score with Israel and how the tribe has been steering our foreign policy to their liking for the last thirty years, give or take. This was big deal for me because I was on active duty during GW I and I recall schumer – the devil’s favorite crotch dropping –  giving interview after interview stating that unless then President GHW Bush came and got a declaration of war from him and the congress, they were going to consider impeaching him because constitutionally, he had no legal right to draw up US Forces and send them overseas in what was going to be an all out war. And that lasted up until the first SCUD missile landed on Tel Aviv. After that, ole chucky was banging the drums of war louder and faster than anyone! I remember thinking, “Oh, ok, that’s how this works, when someone lifts a finger against YOUR group, then people like me have to drop what we’re doing soldier up. Nice to know, thanks!” They said that he would redo trade policies in favor of the average person, yada, yada, yada, basically “America First”.They also went on to point out that the Bushes – because of daddy’s global contacts – would never do any of these things and that people like them have been the real problem for the last twenty years, helping destroy our industrial base.It gave me a new perspective on politics and that was the beginning of my move towards the DR. I have been an avid reader of Pat ever since.

        Pat Buchanan lived in a nation that was 90% white and 10% black. He had nothing against black people, but he understood that the U.S. was founded as a white nation and achieved greatness because it was a white nation. And he was good with that.
Pat Buchanan also lived in a 95% Christian nation that was not subservient to &gt;2% of the population that was not Christian. Nor was it subservient to a non-Christian foreign country on the Eastern shore of the Mediterranean. And he was good with that, too.

        I was listening to the Duran show yesterday on neoconservative failures, which was a great show by the way, I could not help but notice that Duran, who is the older gentleman said that once the neoconservatives fail in their foreign policy adventures he believes America will go back to being the America he knew from the past.I am also older and remember Buchanan but I don’t think America is going back to what it once was.

            I’m not sure how one like Duran can possibly believe this. Take away the politics one still has to look at the cultural make up of our own people and realize they are a far cry from principled or decent living folks. So many are micro managed by pot, prescription pills living in non traditional lifestyles all the while living in skins 30% covered in ink.We ain’t going back without radical change and salvation.

            Enoch Powell was one of the finest products of English culture ever to walk the planet, the youngest person to make professor since Medieval times and the youngest to make brigadier-general, a man with an incredible range of skills, competency and dedication, seeped in the best education the world has seen before or since.But Enoch could not drive a car. He complained about military trucks that you only had to take your hands off the wheels for a few moments for them to go about their own way. He once managed to crash four times on a road trip from London to Edinburg.When the British government, sometimes in the sixties, invented the driver’s license, Powell failed spectacularly. He indignantly blamed the “disgraceful cowardice” of the gentleman from the ministry of traffic.

                Agreed. Powell was one of the last great Britons. The “Rivers of Blood” speech is the closest I know to Buchanans “culture war” brilliance. Do give that a listen if you haven’t. I linked it above.
Powell may not have been the first case of cancel culture, but he certainly was the most spectacular. No one can claim they were not warned.

                    Thanks, I’ll give it a try.I must admit I’m not a big enjoyer of political oratory but Powell was in a class of his own. He spent ten years giving stump speeches all over Britain and mastered the rare art of not talking down to the commoners. He always did his homework and mastered all the subject he talked about to perfection and his speeches are models of rhetorical clarity.I’ve been reading his 1,400-page monster biography on-and-off for the last year, and recently got back into it. Powell protested the open borders-policy of the British Nationality Act of 1948, where Commonwealth citizens could decide whether they wanted to be British. then he became a cabinet minister and the next 300 pages are about Westminster inside cricket, housing policies, political cabals and such, so I haven’t gotten to the Rivers of Blood moment yet.To address what Citizens said, Powell was one of the first to understand that the Empire was over; he was the most zealous imperialist while it lasted, but one of the first to publicly say that England needed to retire its imperial past and return to the virtues that made England great, a haven of law, civilization and individual liberty.I wonder if Pat recognizes something similar.

                        “I wonder if Pat recognizes something similar.”Buchanan’s best book imo is A REPUBLIC, NOT AN EMPIRE, so, yeah. I’m no fan of political oratory, either, but sometimes the speaker matches the times. That’s what happens at around the 24:19 mark in the linked Buchanan speech. Z emphasizes the conciliatory tone at the start but there is a strong belief Buchanan there at the end deliberately sabotaged Bush. I am agnostic on that point.I have not read the massive Powell biography but intend to do so. He truly was a renaissance man, wasn’t he? People think the RIVERS speech sunk him but it was the Conservative Party that did so, which was a preview of things to come. Powell was the most popular British politician of his age, contrary what you would think from current accounts, but the cucks were hellbent on keeping him away from the limelight.This was in the Sixties, mind you.

                        Yes. Tory heavyweight Michael Heseltine opined that after the RoB-speech Powell would’ve won both the Tory chairmanship and the general election with landslide numbers, and he was even more popular amongst Labour voters than Conservatives.That’s why they pulled the trigger on him and why no Tory ever campaigned on immigration again. Winning an election on a hardline immigration platform is still verboten, not just in Britain but in the entire Western hemisphere.Here’s a cough, cough, ad-free copy for anyone with an open format ebook reader:http://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=7A590046A9D68ACE421EC997163DE810The Wiki on him is surprisingly decent too, with this prophetic snippet from the famous speech:That tragic and intractable phenomenon which we watch with horror on the other side of the Atlantic (i.e. race tensions, FK) but which there is interwoven with the history and existence of the States itself, is coming upon us here by our own volition and our own neglect. Indeed, it has all but come. In numerical terms, it will be of American proportions long before the end of the 20th century.

        “pines for a return to his salad days in California”That hits home hard. The old man was born in sunny Southern California in 1943. Perhaps the greatest place, in the greatest time to be alive. He understands intellectually that we live in a low trust society, but he doesn’t feel it in his bones the way I do. I was a late arrival and my older siblings, although not as bad as the old man, don’t feel it either.He just can’t wrap his brain around the concept that they aren’t stupid, and that they are doing what they are doing with the intention to cause destruction. He’s going to be waiting on the Constitution to save us as they try and load up his grandchildren and ship them off to the reeducation camp. He did have enough sense to GTFO of CA shortly after I was born in the early 80’s. So I’ll give him that.

                He would have said what he says today. I saw the writing on the wall. He went to the local elementary school (Orange County) to check things out before my brother started school (late 70’s?). The principal told him that they had the best remedial reading program in the area. The guy running the school was proud the kids couldn’t read. Taxes going up, cost of living going up, MASSIVE influx of people, and to top it off he would have bear the cost of sending his kids to private school. He, to the original point, thought, and thinks, the people running the schools were stupid. They weren’t stupid, they were evil.

This thinking is endemic among Boomers and the remaining Silents. Their unwillingness to call evil “evil” is a huge impediment to any change for the better.
The older generations are more conservative on average and certainly more competent than the younger generations. The world will lose a lot when they pass, but that faulty threat recognition needs to be purged from the populace before we can begin to heal society.

            Like a lot of GenX I’ve met, I was born in CA and my parents moved us out while I was young. When I see old pictures, I recognize it as home. When I’ve visited, I don’t.First time, when I was about 20, a friend invited my band along on his band’s west coast tour. Several venues, mostly in CA, demanded we send ahead our songs’ lyrics, to be judged for political acceptability. Our songs didn’t have lyrics. One place refused us based on a song title. Old punks know which place. The “tranny janny” school of wokeness was born there.Nobody hates Californians enough.

        Friends have been asking me lately why I’m hard on boomers, so I was forced to think about it. Fundamentally, it’s what appears to me to be defeatism— that sense of loss of something that isn’t coming back Z mentions.I was born in the 80s, so I haven’t had that experience, and so to me it looks like a losing attitude, and I despise losers (not people who fail but who give up).It sucks having to live in the wake of that loss, because of the task ahead, but it’s also the advantage of not having anything to lose. It’s a clean slate to some extent. I think that goes a long way to explaining the generational divide.

            Boomer stuff seems lame to me. Like, how many times do we need to hear the same rock songs? Like cool, dude, you got really drunk in 1972 and saw Joan Jett. Even the way they dress, the way they talk is lame.They’re huge pussies for the most part. Now they’re killing themselves in Canada as soon as they get a cancer diagnosis. And fuck their social liberalism too.I don’t feel sad about what’s been lost from the Boomers until now – nothing was lost, that’s just changing demographics. We lost alot between pre-Boomer centuries during the Boomer reign, leading up to now.Dont cry about the past, look to the future. Embrace the future. Use knowledge from the past to shape the future.

                What we had was hope. I screwed up, I have time to make it better. I lost money, hey, it’s America, I can make it back. Work hard, save, I can own a home. My kids would have a real chance at a better life than I did. I really get why GenX and Millenniums have such a hard on for Boomers, but was it really our responsibility to GUARANTEE you a good life? Every now and then a generation has to embrace the suck just because. WW2 was probably the last semi-just cause to die for but maybe the survival of the White race fits the bill for your generation? Don’t really know. I’m just a Boomer.

                    WW2 destroyed Europe and her people. It also cemented the US as a global empire. If those who paid with their lives could see the rainbow mess we live in now, would they say it was semi-just?
Boomers were the consequence of a bad war.

                    I’m Gen-X and I don’t have a hard-on for boomers. Hell, both of my parents are boomers and they are NOT like what many people bitch about. Despite the fact that my dad came from a blue-blood family, you won’t find the typical yankee attitude from him, or anyone else in his family.Ever since I can remember, he’s bitched about the left and how they’ve destroyed the country. He’s also never shied away about the repubs either, always screaming, “Why won’t these pussies fight! They act too much like gentleman, it’s like watching the Giants play!”Mom came from a working-class home. Her mother tended the home and her father built houses. My mother told me that her father refused to vote for Kennedy because he didn’t trust Johnson and always said, “That guy is up to something. I can’t put my finger on it, but he’s got an evil streak in him.”They also bemoaned the 60’s and 70’s. I was a kid at the time, but I remember hearing him howl from his den, “What the hell is wrong with these people! They’re turning this country into a third world dump!”I didn’t know what he was screaming about at the time, but my parents explained it to me when I got a bit older.My parents and grandparents were some of the smartest people I ever met and I’m happy to say that I learned a great deal from them. The only issue I see with boomers – and my father concurs with this – is that there are too many who refuse to step aside and allow some of the X’ers to take over.Are you from Wales, or here?

                        Here, but both sides are from Wales. Came over in 1701/1703. Settlers, not immigrants. Wales is pretty much cucked now, like GB and Ireland. Then again, being from the US I can’t throw stones.

                    I believe Patrick was born before 1946. Need to check this. I was born in 1945 and my mother called me a War Baby. Our high school graduating class of 1963 was very excited and hopeful about a bright future. Then on November 22, 1963, you could say that The Sixties began. The Boomers took over from there.

                I think a lot of that perception is that younger people like us simply weren’t around to experience the events that the Boomers did.
The same thing applies to even younger people that weren’t around for the 80s.

                    I’ve discussed that with friends re: millennials. The ones born in the 80s weren’t nursed on Barney and the internet; at least vaguely remember the end of the Cold War, LA riots, and pre- crime bill violence; remember 9/11 vividly; took the brunt of the War on Terror (along with younger X). Significant differences in outlook from ones born in the 90s as a result, it seems.
(For the record, I was born in ‘80, so technically X, but lets say grunge wasn’t my thing 😀)

                Gen X here. Dude, Joan Jett was 14 in 1972. Nobody had ever heard of her yet. She was basically a nobody until the ’80s. I don’t disagree with you about the boomers, but you gotta get your rock-n-roll trivia straight before you start dissing on an entire generation.

            What I despise about the Boomer is that they could be instrumental in helping the DR. They have money and they don’t have to worry about losing their jobs by publicly supporting our causes.Some are retired lawyers who could set organizations to sue companies and other organizations for discrimination. Sure they’d lose, but they’d put a spotlight on Jim Snow laws.Some are retired real estate guys who could help us start developing our own neighborhoods.Some know local politics and could help our people start to gain local footholds.Etc.But they don’t. They put their heads in the sand, live in gated communities and tell young whites to “buck up” like they did.That’s why I despise Boomers.

                    He’s got a point in that boomers were far more effective at organization. For Millies and younger, though things seem to be shifting somewhat with zoomers, crapping off a text message or DM or Discord chat or whatever is more than adequate to get stuff rolling. No, IRL face time is where the real work gets done.

                    Perhaps, I should have said that I despise the majority of Boomers. Of course, I realize that many are trying to help. It’s just that Boomers have the one thing that younger don’t have: You can’t get fired!As long as you have some friends who agree with you and will stick by you, they can’t destroy your life. They can destroy my life so I have to be incredibly careful.White Boomers have a chance to start something huge, to help create a future for their grandchildren. Plants some damn trees already. Who cares if younger generations give you shit. Maybe it’s deserved, maybe it’s not, but you guys are in a unique position.Maybe you don’t do it for the pat on the back, but because you could help in a way that we can’t.And believe, I know all about catching shit from friends, family, neighbors and co-workers. I’ve been called just about everything. I’ve had huge arguments with my wife about keeping my mouth shut. I have neighbors who won’t even look at me when I walk the dog because I’m so evil. So what, if I had FU money, I’d be doing all the things I mentioned.

                I have a friend who talks about ‘Marxists’ and ‘commies’ completing their takeover, bemoans the sorry and fractured state of the young-uns,  says he feels lucky to have at least experienced America.To which I respond by asking if he thinks it’s odd that government (Democracy!) and corporations (Capitalism!) are the leading supporters of the same. Then I ask if he thinks antifa, the squad, Tik Tok purple hairs, etc., seem like formidable, conquering sorts, how it sometimes looks to me like an entertaining movie for those who ‘won’t be around to suffer’. Finally, I ask if he thinks this all happened overnight, or if it was happening incrementally while most were too busy chasing The American Dream! to take it on.That’s usually when we change the subject 🤣Idk, I still come back when I’ve had my fill of that talk, but these days I’ve mostly accepted the state of affairs as a precondition to whatever I do. The cavalry isn’t coming.

                    Obviously, there are plenty of good Boomers, but it drives me nuts that they could change so much but don’t.
Imagine what a few European-American organizations that were run and financed by respectable looking Boomers could do. Yeah, they’d catch a crazy amount of shit, but the vitriol thrown at them would show other whites how hated they are.
Also, imagine them suing companies for discriminating against whites. Those companies would have to publicly talk about how much they don’t like whites. They’d also have to divulge a lot of information.
I could go, but you get the point.

                I’ll just put my experience of boomer parents out here:
Have millions of dollars, keep a grip on that money tighter than a nun’s pussy, and expect me to be their free lawyer, accountant, carpenter, plumber, electrician, personal chef, housekeeper, and therapist.  More concerned about me preserving their art collection than if I ever get married and have kids.
The “Me” generation indeed.

                I see this all the time here in Oregon with the “native born” crew. I meet a lot of them through my various (yes totally lame) “conservative” meetups and get-togethers. They’ll happily nod along in agreement about gun rights or even immigration but seem strangely nonchalant when younger White people express doubts about their future in the state and talk about relocating.I think some of the problem in the Western US at least is that these states, even including CA, were fairly sparsely settled until after WWII. As a result a lot of the older people still have quite a bit of basically unearned wealth in the form of mineral rights or simply the hyper-inflation in the value of what was really just dusty semi-desert not so long ago. It’s hard to get too worked up about Jim Snow laws preventing younger Whites from earning a good living when you never really needed to earn much in order to retire with a big stash yourself.You can see this when you ask them what they were doing when they were still working. “Oh I worked at the sawmill” says the guy with a 5 bedroom house on as many acres and 2 full size RVs parked out front. This is one of the many disconnects wrought by a combination of geography, geology, and deliberately created overpopulation that will always keep the average older person from grasping what happened and why we can’t do what they did.

                A good many aren’t, for sure. But those who are might as well be working for the other side, if you ask me. Same with the young crowd, but they’re at least capable of doing less damage, even if they tend to do it more directly.

                And I’ll also say I don’t put it all on boomers. This has been going on since well before they were born, but it’s that defeatism that’s crept in that really gets to me. Maybe a function of my personality as much as anything else.

            Was the Boomer life really that good? If they were really happy, it seems like drugs, degeneracy and hedonism wouldnt have had such an allure. They destroyed their own way of life which, to me, suggests that they were not very happy in the first place.

                in the 60’s, in socal, a man with with an aerospace job could have a house at the beach, and another in the mountains.  his wife didn’t need to work, and his kids attended public schools that were all white and the best in the nation.  the tv series The Wonder Years is pretty damn accurate in this regard.  and no one worried about affording medical care.  so yeah, it really was sweet.  oh yeah, no AIDS and no condoms!
the drugs and debauchery was really only about. small sliver of the population, and was wildly exaggerated by the media.

            I’ve been watching a lot ofPerry Masonon Pluto TV recently and I know what you mean.  Yes, there was degenerate rot going on in places like Hollywood, but in the main it appears as a highly functional, truly progressive, socially cohesive world.  A white world.I grew up in the Reagan era and while it wasn’t nearly as clean cut, it was still cohesive and, perhaps more so than the 50’s/early 60’s, people were generally upbeat and positive.  That can’t be underestimated.While none of that is going to “come back” we also shouldn’t let those memories die.  We owe it to those who will steer the next phase.

                        she *could* be and she was definitely supposed to show amorous feelings towards Perry.  But…they could only push that angle so much (which wasn’t much at all) due to Raymond Burr being gay.  He just never was going to be able to project any heat towards Della.   too bad they didn’t pair Della with Paul; that would have generated all kinds of sparks!

                    Bill Hopper was the standout in a great cast.  My mom was a working TV actress and was on two PMs.  She unfortunately didn’t get to work with any of the cast.  We also love PM-the Sixties modernism is so good and as a retired lawyer I enjoy the collegiality in court (it was really like that).

                I don’t have Pluto and instead watch PM of MeTV on a pair of $10 dollar rabbit ears.  Most of the lineup is good for the soul (with the exception of M*A*S*H) and a reminder that this place once did work.  Sat morning cartoons and Mayberry just feel right in the background of life and help insulate one from modernity.

                    Pluto is a free app you can run on your PVC, tablet, phone. They have all the old stuff in dedicated channels. For example, there is a Johnny Carson channel. There are channel for old 70’s game shows, which is interesting as they used young unknown actors to pretend to be people off the streets. Then and now, everything from Hollywood was fake.

        PB’s Death of the West was probably the third or fourth dissident book I ever read, right after Alien Nation, Redneck Manifesto, and Turner Diaries.  Those books were guideposts to this side of the GD.

            A bit off topic but does anyone know a good source for, and a good way to play, dissident audiobooks? I’m getting slowly back in shape and one thing I do to burn some calories is listen to audiobooks on the treadmill. I have this app called Libby that allows you to take books out from the local libraries and listen to them but something tells me they’re not going to offer the books you mentioned.

        If people know of other tributes to Pat Buchanan, perhaps put a reference here in the comments?For example, Tom Woods -who is the kind of person to make “smart libertarian” not quite so much of an oxymoron- did a recent show on Pat on his podcast.
Also, consider Pat’s videos on C-span. Plenty of videos where he’s giving a talk about his books:https://www.c-span.org/person/?3578/PatrickJBuchanan
