        National Review let some intern they have named Bobby Miller criticize Zelensky.  Possible sign the regime is preparing its minions to abandon him?
This closing comment did make me laugh:
“To increase support among conservatives, he(Zelensky) should avoid U.S. political entanglements and stress that his nation’s fight is for Western civilization, not its decadent distortions.”
How does Georgetown accept such a laughably stupid white man into a grad program?

            “Western civilization”, at least the parts that put Zelenskiiiii in power, pretty much IS its decadent distortions. Or is Beltway Kid here hinting that Zelenskiiiiiiiiii should hold off on staging interviews with obvious LGBTQWERTY media like Buzzfeed or Huffpo until he somehow defeats the Russians?

        Did anyone see “V for Vendetta”?
When the good guys ran afoul of the system, they would be disappeared, a black bag forced over the head of the poor bastard when he was taken.
Forgive me, but that was the first thing I thought of when I saw that graphic.
I gotta spend more time at the farm.

            Indeed. If there’s no Behind the Green Door stuff tomorrow or an essay on Monday, I’m prepared to think the worst. As Severian often suggests, we’ll all soon be in the camps for failing to applaud long enough or loud enough because Defeatism is simply not permitted in current year AINO.

        Re: your post on Gab showing the 1991 NHL All Star Game National Anthem at Chicago Stadium…Not sure how many are aware, but that is a long standing tradition for Chicago Blackhawks fans to cheer loudly throughout the National Anthem.  Obviously, during the Gulf War for a big game, it was even more boisterous than usual.  But that tradition still stands today.  I find it to be one of the neatest traditions in sports, especially as they always have a top notch opera singer belt out the lyrics.  Back then it was Wayne Messmer, now it’s Jim Cornielson.  Unfortunately I no longer have the same emotional reaction to the Star Spangled Banner that I used to.It is really the unfortunate thing about Chicago.  Unlike the coastal metropolises, there is still an undercurrent of basic white midwestern sensibility.  You should hear some conversations I have with my neighbors and friends in the suburbs.  Unfortunately that sensibility has been overrun by the minorities and foreign invaders and (((shitlibs))) on the North Shore.

            I find it more than mildly amusing that a very serious subject like secession, rebellion, and independence has to be couched in gay neologisms like “opt-out” so as not to scare Normiecon G. CivNat away from such terribly freighted words, that were last spoken by “traitors” in 1861 who were also  “immoral” slaveowners. DR3 strikes again.

            This is what the shitlibs meant (though I doubt most of them knew it) by all that “I’m a citizen of the world” garbage. It means if you piss off the security apparatchiks ANYWHERE in the world, they can stomp you.

            I’m not sure if there’s any reason for the Indian, other than that this graphic was made in an America which still appreciated whimsy.  I.e., about 70 years before our current Clown World.If you’re of “a certain age” and you were a night owl as a child, you’d have seen that particular display showing on television stations from maybe 12 midnight or 1 AM to maybe 6 AM.  Way back in the Before Times of the late 1960s or early 1970s, television stations actually went off work for the night, and they broadcast the Indian head as a way of saying, “we haven’t been atom-bombed, we’re just off work ’cause we’re still sane enough not to have 24-7 programming”.Wikipedia’s description is oddly good.  I guess no blue-haired leftist lunatic has yet discovered this particular entry and decided to crap it up, yet:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian-head_test_pattern

            Before the days of LCD, flat screen TVs, we had something called a “picture tube” (or CRT for cathode ray). It projected electrons onto the screen from behind at a frequency of 60 cycles per second in a vertical/horizontal pattern. (Completely sweeping the screen up and down). We had to adjust the “horizontal and vertical hold” in order to stabilize the picture. This, to put it in kinda simple terms, acted like an electromagnetic lens that focused the beam and directed it very fast as it scanned.When this greyscale image was created for that purpose, when a TV station had to stop broadcasting media for a while, it gave the viewer an image to adjust his hold, and also the contrast and brightness, in order to get a clear and sharp image.I have no exact reason why to explain the Indian head, but I surmise that it was just a random and easy to recognize image with a good bit of contrast in the various greyscale varieties. It could have been a picture of a bald Eagle or just about anything, someone just happened in to choose the Indian head.

                To further illustrate the concept of the picture tube.
Think of an “etch a sketch” toy. You draw vertical lines and horizontal lines to make a picture. One knob controls one axis, while the other knob draws the perpendicular axis.
This is a very simple and not entirely accurate mental model, but it kinda gives you the idea of how the beam of electrons were directed up/down and left/right. Very fast, so fast that the human eye couldn’t detect it.

                My uncle used to build his own TV sets out of parts. The neighborhood where the World Trade Center was built in the late 60’s – early 70’s was what we used to call the job lots. Store after store of capacitors, resistors, vacuum tubes, potentiometers and the like.  Wooden ships steal minds back then. My brother in law is always bragging about building his own computers , that’s nice….

                    Many ‘average Joes’ replaced tubes and other parts in their television sets in the 50s- tube testers were common in grocery stores when I was a child. I recall smoke coming out of an early set when an amp tube when south…. good times.

        I was in my 30s during his WH— anyone else amazed that the lasting-legacy items of the Obama presidency are Biden, Harris, Yellen, and shooting at the cops? Nobody talks about universal health care or free online school for all any more. On foreign affairs, particularly E. Europe, I would say there has been an almost comical exaggerated-pendulum swing against whatever Obama tried; unintended consequences from the Iran scheme as well.I think he botched the outreach/pandering to Hispanics because he is from Hawaii and therefore understands nothing of them. Latinos he elevated tended to be weirdos like Tom Perez or the Castro brothers. Yes, I know the “Nuyorican” to SCOTUS but if I’m a Democrat, that one seems as impactful as the current VP choice he supported (at Michelle’s goading).Anyway. Just seems odd how inconsequential was the Hopenchange drama, but I’m not old enough to remember Mario Cuomo who had a similar influence, I’m informed.

            Somebody once referred to Mario Cuomo as the “Hamlet of Albany” or “Hamlet on the Hudson” because he was so indecisive about running for president in 1988 and 1992. Cuomo dithered and ultimately refrained from running both times and missed his window of opportunity to become president.

                    All the single ladies understood that Obama is a halfrican “exotic,” not an actual American black guy. Every job he ever had depended on that, especially the presidency.
Clarence Thomas, e.g., is black beyond belief, an absolute *parody* of American blackness, the like of which can’t be produced anymore. Not least because of that, and the dissonance of that with his being ideologically “white” (basically a founding-stock libertarian), he’s hated insanely, especially by white women.
America is a stupid thing.

        I’m starting to see “whispers” and “concerns” amongst Republicans that it is not “conservative” for Ron DeSantis to go after Disney the way he had, because it is a governor “meddling in a private company’s affairs.” They are even bringing up liberal governors during the lockdown, as if lib governors would not do the same exact thing tomorrow if they could. As if AGs like Laetitia James are not pursuing lawfare on ideological opponents.If you need exhibit #54434835598 on why conservacucks never, ever win and never, ever want to win, there it is. I am so sick of these people.

                Great call on DeSantis! He’s an Israel Firster all the way — just not as obnoxious about it as Trump was and remains (it’s not possible to outdo Trump in the cringe department when it comes to fellating “our greatest ally”). So DeSantis is slightly sneakier about it. Not an improvement.

                Desantis is scum. He makes a few good decisions as Florida governor, and that gets him lots of good press from conservative media. But he is definitely not our friend. His loyalty is with the Israelis, not with Americans.

            I suspect that at least some of the conservacucks do actually want to win (though many very clearly have ulterior motives). A lot of conservacucks aren’t particularly bright, yet countless others simply lack the psychological fortitude to face how far behind the eight ball we really are. Sadly, a considerable increase in pain will likely be required to jar them into full consciousness.

            My 79 year old mom lives with me and my family.  The other night a nephew came over to visit and we got a spam call from someone named “Robert Harvey”.  I remarked, “it’s probably Paul’s brother and he wants to tell grandma the rest of the story.”  He looked at me quizzically and said, “The rest ofwhatstory?”
I told him to get off my lawn.

                I’ve recently gotten into watching “First Time Watching” YouTube videos, where some young person watches a movie I fondly remember.  The best ones are the old classics, but I’m truly astounded at how untutored many of these young people are.  The things they don’t know frankly shock me.  In ‘Who Framed Roger Rabbit’, most of them have never heard of “Shave and a Haircut”.  But the worst was a girl watching ‘Casablanca’ for the first time.  When the cast list came up on the screen, she blandly announced that she’d never heard of any of these actors.  I simply mouthed to my husband “HUMPHREY BOGART?????”  Never heard of him.  How did our culture become so uprooted?

                Loved Paul Harvey on the radio, my favorite one was the guy who went hunting and came back to berate his wife for not including extra socks, she said she put them in his gun case—also remember laying in bed at night secretly listening to Father Patrick Payton and “the family that prays together, stays together”. A short Christian program along the lines of the Twilight Zone and Cosmic Justice. Good times-

Cornelius Rye showed up in a pink 1959 Cadillac with a gaggle of black hoes n’ bitches…and they went into your studio to do their business. I tried to stop them but Puffy C shoved his 9mm Glock in my face and said he’d light me up if I didn’t get lost…😞

        Stay safe out there in Lagos if your quest for repair requires a search and acquisition in physical space/time. Always a miss when your show doesn’t hit.
For the readership. I arrived at Chapter 3 in G. Faye’s, “Archeofuturism.” This is a great read. It is great in that it analyzes the problems without moaning and it is proscriptive as well as a call to joining in with radical thought and bold action. I highly recommend, for Chapters 2 and 3 alone.

            That was the first thing I thought of too. 😉For the aged here the Fallout series (referring explicitly to Fallout 3) takes place in an alt-past/future where nuclear war occurred in the late 50s.  Needless to say, the ruins of a once great civilization depicted in the game are in many ways preferable to the situation we’re in now.

                ACKSHUALLY, the backdrop of Fallout is an alternate history where an over the top hyper-jingoistic version of 1950s culture persisted into the late 21st century, causing a nuclear war over the last bit of accessible oil.  That’s meant to explain the existence of ray guns and robots that didn’t exist in the 1950s.Considering that the games largely blame the nuclear war on nationalism the setting wasn’t intended to be based, but they accidentally made the “bad guys” look too cool (like with a 100 ft tall robot that shouts anti-communist slogans as it throws miniature nuclear warheads), so the games have been favorites among right-wingers.

        Woke up this morning, had a cup of coffee, watched the sun rise, the spring flowers bloom, and listened to the birds singing.  I was at peace, and one with the world.
“This sucks!”, I thought.  “I’ll tune into the Zman Friday broadcast, that will bring my mood to appropriate levels of curmudgeonly grumpiness  befitting a man my age”
Now this?  WTF.  Time for more coffee.
