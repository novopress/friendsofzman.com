        Lots of confusion about Austrian economics. Austrian economics is completely value-free. It makes no attempt to tell you what you should choose, it merely seeks to inform you of the consequences of that choice. It tends to appeal to libertarians, yes, but not because of any principle of Austrian economics.If one placed an extremely high subjective value on murder, rape and torture, the Austrian economist would inform him that it would be irrational to embrace libertarianism, because that would not likely lead to his highly-valued outcomes. The Austrian would counsel that communism is more likely the rational choice to seek his ends.

        There is no evidence of the system not being sustainable , or of collapse.
This is the ultimate false hope.Betting on ‚ÄúCollapse‚Äù (TM) is the ultimate and fatal false choice.
The only thing that collapsed was any resistance.
Trump may have forced them into the Open, but since they have openly enforced their will however bizarre it seems to us ‚Äì who have no power- it makes total sense for them.
The enemy is not collapsing, we collapsed .

            I hate to say it FeinGul but you are probably right. This is what Heritage America is focused on (posting from my local Nextdoor site):Fiber-Optic folks working on our street today. Hubby is so excited I threatened to make him some pom-poms so he can be a Fiber-Optics cheerleader.  He said, ‚ÄúBetter yet ‚Äì I‚Äôll just drag the grill down there and feed those guys!‚Äù ü•¥This woman‚Äôs ‚ÄúHubby‚Äù is no doubt excited to get fiber optic service so that he can stream ESPN, NFL, and NBA all year long while wearing Colin Kaepernick  and Lebron James jerseys and grilling on the back deck.Grillers of the World, Unite!

            Maybe yes, maybe no. As the resident blackpiller, ask anyone, I am pretty confident that there will be an attempt to impose a Rwandan solution. But with Rwandan results.The leadership is old and divided. Sailer‚Äôs talking about Franz Ferdinand, the leadership in the West reminds me of the Hapsburgs at the end ‚Äî elderly and incompetent. Replacements are loud and angry but fit only for bartending or screaming abuse. They are up against an enemy who already has deployed bioweapons, and promises more. There is the weird stuff with the election audits.Why are they going on now, and why are they being ALLOWED to go on, given that Biden‚Äôs Regency has deployed more than 100 lawyers and the DOJ? Someone has buyer‚Äôs remorse ‚Äî likely the generals and admirals who sided with Biden thinking they‚Äôd get Clinton and found they got Edith Wilson plus AOC running things. Lloyd Austin‚Äôs purge is not just aimed at Corporals and Sergeants. Its aimed at White Generals and Admirals. And below. Think those guys are ready to retire to let Austin pack the Pentagon black?Moreover massive inflation is coming and will stay ‚Äî all that ESG stuff has delayed over the last ten years the capital investment needed for affordable energy. Imagine 1970s stagflation with even greater black crime and worship of blacks as holy racial redeemers and defeat and disgrace abroad?Suppose the audits show that Trump not Biden won Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Georgia? What then? Yes Biden has insider‚Äôs legitimacy in large swathes of the Government (DOJ, FBI/CIA, etc) plus Wall Street and Corporate America. Imagine meat rationing with blacks getting extra shares and open borders still and the military and contractors being downsized even more?All the regime can enforce is what it can do in a continental sized nation at the point of a gun. That‚Äôs it, nothing more. The ‚Äúupside‚Äù of inflation is that it makes social credit worthless, as the money is worthless and people go to barter or something else.And I‚Äôm the resident black piller.

            The ancient Greek Empire collapsed. The Roman Empire collapsed. The Soviet Union Collapsed. Yes, collapse is on the menu for the Good Ol‚Äô USA too. And when an empire or nation collapses, it really doesn‚Äôt care about your opinion regarding it‚Äôs probability of happening. It just happens, ready or not.

                TomA,
None of them collapsed.  They were conquered or overthrown.  By men.
Collapse (TM) is to some an invisible force, like ‚Äúthe market ‚Äú or ‚Äúthe right side of history ‚Äú or Jesus, or Q Anon.  No.  None of that just happened.  Global warming has more substance.
Trust the Plan, lol.Trust collapse, it‚Äôs coming.  Since the 1970s at least.
Meanwhile do nothing.
And Grill.  Don‚Äôt forget to grill.

                    Rome was history before it‚Äôs official demise in 476. Yes it over run by barbarians but it already had rotted so badly within a 100 years before it existed in name only.
The Soviet Union just imploded from internal rot and a few commies picked up the pieces.
The U.S,A isn‚Äôt special. or immune like you think. BTW there was no collapse coming since the 70‚Äôs, I‚Äôm old enough to remember those times. The country was quite healthy back then, compared to ir‚Äôs necrotic state that we see now..

            The dollar will go when they want us to die ‚Äì of starvation.
The food distribution system actually will collapse without money.  However that collapse too is man made.

        Of course, the main argument comes down to ‚Äúhow best to feed the zoo animals fairly and efficiently.‚Äù The assumption being that that which is of primary importance to human health and well being can be boiled down to food and shelter. And of course, access to stuff. Like zoo animals. And so, after a few hundred years of this system, people, being exceptionally adaptable, now act as animals, not men and women. Libertarians are the worst with this. I can remember an argument that came down to treating humans like biological robots on an assembly line was actually a good thing because they could purchase microwave ovens, something that even the wealthiest of the past century could never have. And of course, eventually the human robot will be phased out. Creative destruction, they call it. Of course, they can be trained as software designers. Really? Do you know what years on an assembly line does to a human? It turns their brain to mush.

            Their brain was already mush, or subpar, otherwise they‚Äôd have been programmers to begin with.  No economic theory‚Äîright or left‚Äîworks without an acceptance and understanding of HBD principles.  Within an HBD framework, much of what we call the ‚Äúhuman condition‚Äù and its origins/solutions becomes apparent.

        Was reading that accountants have the highest rates of alcoholism among the professional classAnyone who has ever done accounting probably understands why.  For me personally, simply putting my taxes together for my accountant makes me want to kill myself.Not everyone is cut out to be a businessman.   My guess is that around 10% of the people are just naturally inclined to be in business and deal with money money money all day, but the other 90% is not mentally wired in that way yet EVERYONE pretty much has to force themselves to be.Larger point being that I think that dealing with money and dollar signs all day and reducing everything into a dollar value is having a negative effect on people.  And yet with either Marxism or Capitalism that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre forced to do.  Probably why so many people use drugs both legal and illegal.  I think it‚Äôs like 25% of adults are on meds?  Our consumer culture and reducing everything into dollar amounts is depressing.   It‚Äôs taking a toll on people, without a doubt.

            ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs taking a toll on people, without a doubt.‚ÄùI do not disagree with you.

                Notice how we were a happier country when we had more jobs where men could in fact use their hands?  I had a summer job making furniture in Tampa; the camaraderie with the guys and then there was great satisfaction and feeling of accomplishment when at the end of the day you see all the pieces of furniture everyone made now boxed up and ready to ship.  It was probably the most enjoyable job I have ever had.   I did not make much (I think it was $5/hr at a time when rent for a decent apartment was like $300 a month as a point of reference), but I always went home feeling good and slept like a baby out of physical exhaustion.Those 90% of people I speak of, say 90% of men, if we had more manufacturing and more stuff where men could use their hands we would be a much happier place.But instead there are few opportunities for men who like to use their hands.

                    For one summer when I was a late teenager, I was part of a crew that built BMX tracks. Dirt geometry arguments, dirt physics arguments, silently pushing dirt around for a week or two, then on the last couple days riding it better than anyone else ever would.Did that while studying centuries of Viennese composers and German philosophers via Walkman. Realized too late that that was my best available life of the mind/body. Became a formerly beautiful, potentially great (in a small local way) man hunched grotesquely over a desk for decades, reading legal garbage and making loan payments. Should have kept shoveling.At least I met my wife back when I could still pull a good one. Young guys now don‚Äôt even have a shot at that.

        I see this as a part of our culture‚Äôs insistence on quantifying the qualitative, the appearance of which phenomenon means your cultural decline is terminal. A strong, self-confident civilization, like the Victorians, knew that e.g. homosexuality and prostitution were wrong ipso facto. They also knew both were going to happen regardless, and, being self-confident, were ok with that ‚Äî they could grok concepts like ‚Äúlegal but wrong‚Äù (prostitution) and ‚Äúillegal but tolerated‚Äù (homosexuality). The trick is threading the needle.Once their self-confidence began to slip, Westerners started hauling out data. Magnus Hirschfeld (((yeah, I know))) doesn‚Äôt ring too many bells for modern ears, but he should, as he‚Äôs right up there with Freud and Marx and (to a lesser extent) Nietzsche with ‚Äúguys who should be routinely burned in effigy, for getting us into this mess.‚Äù Hirschfeld used Teh Science to show that umpteen percent of the population was gay, that prostitution wasn‚Äôt so bad, and so forth. He and his disciples painted the guys who regularly used phrases like ‚Äúipso facto‚Äù and couldn‚Äôt do stats-level math as a bunch of old fuddy-duddies, hopelessly out of it. And since the post-WW1 world was the stat-heads‚Äô world, the only socially palatable response to a guy like Hirschfeld was to deploy counter-data, and‚Ä¶ well, here we are.It doesn‚Äôt matter what percentage of the population is ‚Äúintersex,‚Äù as the Edwardians would say. Nor does it matter what outcomes prostitution correlates with, or how strong the correlation is. You don‚Äôt need any data at all. They‚Äôre just BAD, full stop, and while they‚Äôll always be with us, the only socially beneficial thing to do is benign neglect when they keep to the shadows, ruthless stomping when they become obnoxious. Alas, it takes the kind of civilizational confidence where we all can use phrases like ‚Äúipso facto‚Äù to do that, and‚Ä¶ well, here we are.

        The problem with all economic theories is that they all support interest bearing economies. By assigning every country‚Äôs currency to private banks, and borrowing money into circulation, you only guarantee one result. The house, i.e., the lending institutions, will always win. You cannot have an economy that lends money at interest that doesn‚Äôt go through boom and bust cycles. During the boom, everyone is borrowing money to get in on the action. During the bust, most people can‚Äôt borrow more money to stave off disaster, so they loose their wealth and property, which is sold at pennies on the dollar. Sold to the same people that lent the money in the first place. So, over time, eventually all the physical assets of a country will belong to a smaller and smaller group of people. This is why you can know this country was sold out by its representatives in Washington when they turned the issuance of currency over to the privately controlled Federal Reserve. Of course, it was sold as the solution for eliminating boom and bust cycles and stabilizing the economy. Fourteen years later, we had the greatest world wide depression the world has ever seen. Hmmm‚Ä¶.makes you wonder.

        A third way is Catholic social teaching. A good summary is John Paul II‚Äôs ‚ÄúCentesimus Annus‚Äù from 1991, just as the Cold War ended. He lived under Marxism and appreciated capitalism, with reasonable social restrictions:https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_01051991_centesimus-annus.html

            Yes, the elites are endlessly practicing selective remedy with impunity upon the peons, so why is it wrong for turnaround to be fair play? Why should they be exempt from accountability?
They have two main strategies going forward. The first is to coerce acquiescence to indoctrination and sheepletude. Or alternately, get the plebs to fight each other to the death and kill off all the alphas that might someday rise against them. The first is brain-dead and the second is body-dead. The cure is disease-dead.

        ‚ÄúThe trouble with Austrian School economics is it also striped morality and group preference from public debate‚Äù.I‚Äôll admit that I haven‚Äôt read every book written by every member of the Austrian School, but I have read Hayek, von Mises, Rothbard, Woods, Murphy and North.  To a man, they all argue that morality and group preference are better attained by freedom of association than the democratic process, and in particular freedom of association allows for more nuance and local quirks than centralized decision-making would. It‚Äôs a bit unfair to claim they were unconcerned with morality and group preferences. It‚Äôs vastly more accurate to say that they didn‚Äôt view large scale political action as a  good way to impose group morality, and argued that large scale political action was likely to cause or, alternately, enable degeneracy. There may have been others in the Austrian School who argue otherwise, but I‚Äôm not aware of them.

None of the authors you cite have supported crony capitalism; to the contrary, they have all found political economy to be repugnant and they have all warned us that there would be those who would conflate the Austrian School with Apple / Antifa / BLM / Google / Gov.co Ltd.

The system the Austrians and Friedmanistas put forward leads inexorably to our people being rentier serfs of Blackrock the Landlord and heliots of Duke Bezos.  The current feces pit of an economy we have is the logical, perhaps even necessary, outcome of their theories, which snuck in under Billy Clinton, and went full throttle under Bush the Idiot, and went to warp speed under Obama.

                There is a subtle distinction between libertarians and neoliberals. Hayek and Friedman could be either depending on who their audience was.What we‚Äôve had since the 70s is the selective gutting of the New Deal/social democrat administrative state in certain areas (trade, labor rights, financial regulation) but the preservation of the New Deal/social democrat state in most other areas (military, things like HUD and HHS). From the standpoint of the dogmatic libertarian this is still ‚Äústatist‚Äù because we haven‚Äôt cut spending by 40% or abolished 5 cabinet-level departments, as Ron Paul and Gary Johnson urged in their presidential campaigns. However, there has still been a significant shift towards libertarianism since the Nixon years. By any standard, the conservative/libertarian economic movement was very successful in shifting government policy, it just hasn‚Äôt won total dominance.The difference between the neoliberal center and libertarian dogmatists are (1) the libertarians are more extreme (as noted above), so their policies are only selectively enacted, and (2) neoliberals have no qualms about using state power in an arbitrary manner to help investment banks (TARP)‚Äìto the libertarian this is ‚Äúcrony capitalism‚Äù.

            This is where they are wrong. They think ‚Äúmorality and group preference‚Äù just spring from economic order. That is exactly backward. Economics is always down stream from culture. The Austrian School was always about ducking the cultural issues by kicking them down the road, much in the same way Marxism kicked the economic policy issue down the road.

                From what I recall reading, and please tell me if I‚Äôve missed something that states otherwise, they make no claims to where group preference come from, and they certainly don‚Äôt claim that moral order is the result of economic policy. Insofar as the two intersect, they make it abundantly clear economic interests should be subordinated to moral preference (eg. they would argue that, say, a Christian baker should not under any circumstances be compelled to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple if they didn‚Äôt want to, which means in this instance the moral order comes before and informs the economic activity). Frankly, it‚Äôs strange that you assert that people who argue that people should have the ability to refuse goods or services, and not compelled by force to participate in or practically tolerate behaviors they find morally repulsive are actually in favor of globohomo mercantilism. These writers have all defended the moral validity of boycotts and freedom of association so that people can act in accordance with their own preferences. Have you confused them with another group?

                    Just about every claim they make is based on morality.  Take the ‚Äútaxation is theft‚Äù line.This is morality.  The whole freedom of association thing is all based morality.  Private property is based on morality.  Private property, in their view, originates from people  fencing and working to improve the land and the concept of owning yourself and therefor the product of your labor.  Most of what they say (and I grant that Libertarianism is mixed up in it) is based on morality.Many of them will come out and say that Libertarianism is the only moral system.  Tom Woods, for example makes that claim. Stefbot does the same thing.Not exactly the moral order coming from the results of economic policy, but they are certainly interlinked.They may talk about wedding cakes, but that is only for now. They might have already stopped doing it. They don‚Äôt put any of their effort into saying we have a right to protect our nation from foreigners or to protect ethnocentric neighborhoods. At best, they might support you putting a sign in the window of your shop saying ‚Äúno X allowed‚ÄùIn fact, they go out of their way to say borders are evil.  They actually make the argument that only property owners along the border should have the ability to control the flow of people over the border.  So Soros can buy a plot of land on the border and have the hordes invade. It‚Äôs retarded.

                I agree with your take.Austrian theorists don‚Äôt support ‚Äúfreedom of association‚Äù in the normal sense of the term, be it just one‚Äôs desire to pick and choose whom he hangs around with or what makes him happy.  Rather, they see it purely in economics terms ‚Äî a businessman should have the right to deny service to anyone he does not want to do business with and so on and so forth.With the Austrian School, it‚Äôs still all about money and trading.  And now granted, they are economists, so one can argue ‚ÄúWell, what else you expect them to do?‚Äù  But an economist also has to have some grasp of human nature, and yet they rarely do and see everything in terms of commerce.  As if that represents the totality of existence.  Perhaps they‚Äôd like life to be that simple, but then anyone who knows it isn‚Äôt is still stuck with a society where people in power think it is.  So we are dealing with people who see us as mere units of labor and consumption.  And from that we have seen ourselves become dehumanized in their eyes.

            Markets are good for a lot of reasons but social stability is absolutely not one of them.   Pretty much every economist from Adam Smith on, including Marx, realized that markets drove innovation and social change. Schumpeter coined the phrasecreative destructionto encapsulate the concept.
The Austrians notion of the morality of markets was a mix of a counter to Communisns claim to morality of command economics;  a derivation of the enlightenment era progress of history and self delusion.

                The Austrians are stuck in the 19th century. It‚Äôs like they never got the memo that the gold standard is dead and buried. Hyperinflation is coming any day now‚Ä¶.These same people support nation wrecking ideas like free trade and open borders.  They support every evil of libertarianism.  Yeah, they got the pricing mechanism and the question of the central bank correct.  But try telling people like Shapiro that banks loaded up with printed money shouldn‚Äôt be able to buy up the nation‚Äôs housing stock to turn us into renters.  He actually tweeted how opposing this is taking money out of the pockets of those home-owners selling out to them.America should go back to the ‚ÄúAmerican System‚Äù and ditch free trade and open borders.

            The problem there is that liberal democracy is fundamentally inconsistent with freedom of association; democracy will always vote down free association due to the moral imperative that all voices must participate ‚Äì sitting out or doing your own thing are immoral under democracy, and will not be tolerated.Also, they are not substitutable.  ‚ÄúFreedom of association‚Äù is just one principal in a poltical theory, not a complete system like liberal democracy.  That‚Äôs like saying Hayek prefers a Chevy steering wheel to a Ford F-150 ‚Äì thats just a tiny part and cannot stand alone.Finally, it is not unfair to claim they were explicitly amoral. Mills and Smith do as well; they assume the moral solution will result from the democractic voice of the marketplace. Freedman says as much.  From the horse‚Äôs mouth (quibble if Chicago is the same as Austrian), monetarism, market resolutions, and Austrianism are explicitly and necessarily amoral systems.  Very clearly, market equilibrium results differ from systems using moral principals.

                I don‚Äôt think you can separate Austrians/Freshwater from libertarianism.  Also, to be fair, the Austrians do try to separate themselves from the Freshwater (Chicago) stuff.

            I read Z‚Äôs ongoing analysis of liberal democracy as a postmortem. I‚Äôm trying to do the same thing. Like Jared Taylor, who I‚Äôm told says that his writing is mainly to prove to the robot historians of 2315 that not all White people were utterly insane, so we dissidents have a duty to analyze the failures of the system we find ourselves in, such that future generations hopefully won‚Äôt make the same mistakes. Just as the original Constitution would‚Äôve been impossible without the Founders‚Äô deep understanding of guys like Cicero and Machiavelli, who analyzed the fate of the Roman Empire, so (hopefully) a future generation, thinking about giving liberal democracy a go, will take a look at these writings and smarten up.

                        I agree, and probably Nietzsche would have too. I don‚Äôt think he ever comments on America or any politics outside Europe. He was definitely no friend of democracy, even the 19th century European variant. Among many other epithets, he used the term ‚Äúradical aristocrat.‚Äù That might have well described our Founders.In any event, we certainly can‚Äôt allow a nation to be ruled by free, White landowner males any more. We must allow women, the freed slaves and (in progress) anyone who slips across the border, to participate!Nietzsche didn‚Äôt say this, but hie might have: A great nation (early USA) early on, was ruled by great men; at least the ruling class was restricted to the successful, the wealthy, the educated (they‚Äôd have been the nobility in Europe.). As the franchise is broadened to include the hoi polloi (the ‚Äúweak‚Äù, the ‚Äúbotched‚Äù, the ‚Äúherd‚Äù) is it any surprise that the overall quality of the entire nation suffers? Problem: once you‚Äôve hobbled, marginalized or banished the nobles, who is going to take command if/when a crisis occurs?

                It does make you wonder if any humans can stick with any decent system. Human nature seems to eventually erode every good plan.The Founding Fathers took a pretty good stab at creating a damn fine system and look where we are. They should have made the racial element of the country more explicit, but they probably didn‚Äôt even think that it needed to be said. Why would Whites ever let in non-Whites?But even if they had been explicit about that, who‚Äôs to say that it would have lasted. They were very explicit that only land-owning White men could vote and look at what we have.A people can‚Äôt rely on nice words written on a piece of paper to save them. They have to fight each generation for what they have, or it will be taken away.That‚Äôs what future historians should learn from us.

                Well if you and Z are right we should have never left the Crown. And we should be bending a knee to QE.The problem all systems have a fly in the ointment and that is mankind. It screws up every political system. Case in point pre-WWi Europe that was still run by aristocrats of various stripes. And what did they do? Blow their collective brains out in a senseless war that ended up destroying all of them. Gutting their gene pool in the process.And what was their dying gasp? To set the state for WWII.Democracy has it‚Äôs issues but the sort of mass insanity that obliterated a good part of the White population takes a nobility.Our problem has always been one of extending the franchise to people who should not have it.  I don‚Äôt think the founders thought we‚Äôd be so stupid as to give it to women, 3rd world savages and permanent wards of the state.

            Far be it for me to speak for our host, but I assume the upshot of it is that our demographic reality can be pinned on the ever-expanding need for our rulers to bribe the voting populace, and that a similar problem is plaguing most of the liberal democracies of the West.

            Not at all. I‚Äôve made the point for years that the great chain of causality starts with biology. In fact, I‚Äôm the guy who coined the term ‚Äúgreat chain of causality‚Äù. I‚Äôve written and talked extensively about how the Nordic countries, for example, made socialism work, because they could make anything work.
Liberal democracy is a system that incorporates economics, petty politics, institutions and culture. To a great degree, it is the result of America‚Äôs unusual origin as a multicultural, multiethnic and multiracial republic.

                The Nordics are rotting as well whether from liberal democracy or socialism, if there is a difference. The feminization of the Nordic mind is even greater than our own. Since their women didn‚Äôt have enough drama they are hell bent on importing it.Nordic success is a fairly recent thing. Swedon was dirt poor in the 19th century. They afforded socialism only by applying the creation of others but now it has run its course. No society can withstand feminization, and socialism is completely natural to the female mind.

                    James, I have largely lost my distaste for socialism that I acquired as a conservative.  It seems that most people want a social safety net, which is socialism, at least on a small scale.  What‚Äôs the harm?
However, if someone wants to make a case against socialism to me now then the way to do it would be to argue that socialism necessarily entails egalitarianism, feminism and open borders as well.  The fascism of the 20th century seems to argue against that, but none of them lasted long enough to know for sure.

                Z-man, you lost me on the last sentence :  ‚Äú‚Ä¶ America‚Äôs unusual origin as a multicultural, multiethnic and multiracial republic.‚Äù
How was American in the time of the Revolution (origin), multiracial?  Black Slaves aside (who were without import) everyone else was basically White and European.  In your great chain of causality: Biology-&gt;Race-&gt;Ethnicity-&gt;Culture-&gt;Society‚Ä¶, America *started out* as a White, European nation.

                        The differences (ethnic, cultural) among the people from the European continent was far less than the the differences we find from people of the various continents (races).  And that started way after the Revolution.  Hell, for that matter, I grew up in the 90% White, ethnic society of the 50‚Äôs and it was nothing like what we have now with our multiracial imports.  I knew Irish, Greek, Italians, etc.‚Äînone of which had significant anti-American bent to them.  Yes, there ware different traditions ala culture, but the uniting factor was that they were ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù and the similarities far outweighed the differences.

            Line:  I don‚Äôt believe Zman is claiming our current demographics would work with some system other than liberal democracy.  Rather, he is explaining how the basic tenets of liberal democracy led us to the cultural degeneracy and suicidal demographics we have today.  The basic assumptions about man and markets and culture, from the Enlightenment through the Austrian economists, were all wrong ‚Äì or at the very least dangerously incomplete.  And those assumptions underlay the ‚ÄòAmerican system‚Äô of government and economics and allowed ‚Äì nay ‚Äì directed said system to devolve into what we have today.

        Say what you will about fascism in Italy and Germany, at the least the fusion of state and corporate power were ostensibly to benefit the people. Hitler and Mussolini actually liked their people and culture.
Sure, the elites got more than their fair share of the pie, but the moral code backing the order was about promoting the welfare and independence of the German and Italian people.
The moral code backing our version of fascism is hatred of the founding stock of the United States and European countries.

            Well said.  In every political system, there is a chance that the elite will cease to identify with the people and betray them.  The best way to minimize this possibility is a country with a homogeneous people, including the leadership.  Ideally, the country will feel like an extended family.
Say what you want about Hitler and Mussolini, they clearly loved their people.

        Current-day economists working in this tradition are referred to as Austrian economists and their arguments came to dominate in the West, particularly in America.Really? Weren‚Äôt and aren‚Äôt the Keynesians the most significant group of economists in the West? The Austrians are a small, relatively unknown, sect of heterodox academics with little influence on economic policy. In fact, in the line of economists seeking attention they have been passed by the Modern Monetary Theory chartalists, whose ideas about money directly coincide with the current multi-trillion dollar enpixelation explosion. The foremost Austrians, Menger, von Mises, Rothbard and even Hayek are non-entities in contemporary America. The most famous economist in the US is Paul Krugman, who hasn‚Äôt an Austrian cell in his body.Central planning. What institution doesn‚Äôt employ central planning? Central planning is said to be the weakest point of socialism since adequate information to make and realize the plans made isn‚Äôt necessarily available. That might be true but even more significant but never mentioned iscentral response, a great example of which has been the efforts to mitigate the disaster of the imaginary disease stalking the planet. All the responses to the Covid fiction are the result not of scientific investigation but instead of central government responses based on political issues. This extends to every aspect of government activity. Problems with the Chinese? Build more aircraft carriers, which will be rusting piles of junk in just a few years. A huge percentage of unwed mothers? Pay them to have more babies. High school graduates that can‚Äôt read or write? Build bigger schools and pay the teachers more. The US educational system is socialism in high heels and fishnet stockings.

                Friedman‚Äôs monetarism is only one aspect that is subsumed within the Austrain school (though I believe the nomenklatura have evolved it into neoMonetarism at this point?). Claiming to distance Chicago from Austrian is like trying to cleave Trotskyism from Leninism: outside of esoteric mumblings in the politburo (or academe), to the people actually experiencing the results of these theories, they‚Äôre the same.

            All those systems are examples of ‚Äútake what you want, leave what you don‚Äôt‚Äù.  Keynes is a great example where they took his ‚ÄúSpend when you got it, save when you don‚Äôt‚Äù and only ever did the first part whether they had it or not.  Those systems are flawed to begin with, but the resulting caricatures are even more flawed.

            I think you‚Äôre right. I fear a future where virtually any small group can tailor a virus to do whatever it likes. Say, kill of as many of an unwanted genotype (family, claim, ethnic group) as they like. If mRNA jabs can be created to fight a virus, they can equally be created to produce any number of other effects, some possibly disastrous. Right now, these powers are fairly specialized. But as technology improves, costs become cheaper. Many of these things are probably already within technological reach. I cringe at what will be available in ten or twenty years. Much of this is well explored in fiction, especially SF.Alas, given the realities of human nature, we are much more likely to face a world of ‚Äú12 Monkeys,‚Äù ‚ÄúOmega Man,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Stand,‚Äù or, some other dystopian future, than we are to all have two-hundred year lifespans, enough food to eat, endless leisure and world peace.

                Ben ‚Äì One of the early TEOTWAKI fiction works I read from Kindle Unlimited (cannot recall title or author) entailed just such a genetically tailored virus.  In this book, the Israelis intended the virus to target the Arabs but, due to failure to adequately account for their genetic similarity to Jews, ended up killing off their own people as well.

            Woods has a lot of good views.  He is a unapologetic advocate of free association, up to and including covenants, ending fiat money, and traditional morality.  He‚Äôs also well aware of the problems of race, but it‚Äôs far too edgy for his niche.The problem is, he also doesn‚Äôt believe in regulating vices like pornography, is against federal influence in the private sector, and the discourses he‚Äôs not willing discuss are the only discourses that matter now.He would have been largely a great voice for our interests in the 1950‚Äôs.  Now, the ship has sailed, and it‚Äôs all about gaining power and utilizing it.   The framework he‚Äôs arguing in is as applicable to today as 1500‚Äôs England.

                To be fair to Woods, when it comes to certain vices, there really is no substitute for self-regulation. There were tons of laws on the books until recently about public obscenity, prostitution, homosexuality and the rest. First they went unenforced, then they were mostly repealed. If their enforcement could have worked, surely we‚Äôd have seen that by now. Cf. The war on drugs for additional analysis.

                    The purpose of the laws were not to eradicate them, but to force them into seedier areas where they could not bother normal people as easily.

        ‚ÄúWhen massive global corporations are stripping people of their lights, often by funding street gangs to assaults people going about their business, it is laughable to defend the ‚Äúfree market‚Äù system that produced these companies. When state sponsored financial concerns are buying up houses to create new renters, in the name of capitalism, the so-called free market is just as ridiculous as the men in dresses.‚ÄùIt is textbook fascism, to be precise. It is ironic the street thugs who defend this order think of themselves as ‚Äúanti-Fascists.‚Äù They are children of upper middle class Whites, for the most part, who will whine the most when shorn of their worldly goods and wealth. Horrible time to live, but that will be lovely to watch. The residual Good White ‚ÄúLeft‚Äù is protecting that stuff right now, but they are being ushered off the stage quite rapidly.

        Reminds me of Limbaugh‚Äôs observation of the actor Ron Silver at Clinton‚Äôs inauguration.  The jets flying overhead and Silver‚Äôs commie companion complaining about the military presence. Silver consoled him saying, they are now our jets and military. Of course later he learned to love the Rino zionists because, well because.
Not we hear the same sort loving the corporations because now they are in the progressive looney camp. It‚Äôs too much.

            Not that it matters, but the corporations are not actually in the progressive looney camp.  They are making the smart play that the marxist left will give them a pass, as will the spineless RINO right on libertarian and bribery grounds.  Looks like they are threading that needle pretty well.  At least until the new left takes over and there is no one left to defend them.  Sucks for us all.

        There is a third choice. You can simply become an antibody and kill off the disease cells one at a time. 4S and focus is an ancient remedy for the type of systemic problem that currently ails us.

        It sounds like there‚Äôs only one solution. Identify who is behind the curtain and make them stop. A lot of our enemies who are at least smart enough to keep this monster running are old. ‚ÄúHope lies with the actuarial tables,‚Äù as I think you said. Most of our younger enemies are too stupid to run anything, but they can screw things up and keep anything from running functionally, which causes a different problem. These problems can be solved, and probably will be solved, and it will be ugly. But, as the old blogger Thrasymachus used to say, ‚ÄúUgly is good. Beautiful right now is just putting pancake makeup on a syphilitic whore.‚Äù Comfort and stability are great, but they can‚Äôt be the ultimate ideal, and in order to build something new, we are going to have to suffer for awhile.

            I‚Äôve been reading a lot about the Bolsheviks. After 1905 they most concluded that the way forward was to organize and wait for the crisis, that they were sure would inevitably come. The truth is, revolutions require the people in charge to make mistakes and create a crisis they cannot contain. It‚Äôs less violent brother, reform, also requires crisis, which delegitimizes the people ate the top of the ruling order.

                It‚Äôs frustrating just to wait, but your other options are to participate in something illegitimate (i.e. voting) and thereby give the system a patina of legitimacy, or take action against the system while it‚Äôs powerful, get your ass destroyed, and give the system further justification for clamping down after they use your isolated attempt as evidence that there‚Äôs a massive boogeyman army out there that needs to be combated. They‚Äôll be dining off that James Fields kid for years. Right now I‚Äôm looking forward to Nancy Pelosi dying of old age, hoping her lungs fill with fluid on her deathbed and it hurts. People will say, ‚ÄúWhen they die, someone else will just take their place.‚Äù But that‚Äôs the good thing about diversity. They‚Äôre too stupid to keep it running. I‚Äôm only in my thirties.

                    This was a debate within Marxists circles in the early 20th century. One camp wanted to engage in formal politics, while the other camp wanted to remain outside of it. It is an age old debate, it seems. Sam Francis noted this with the Buckley-ites. Once you engage in formal politics, you legitimize it.

                        It was a debate within the v√∂lkish circles that Mustache Guy ran with (remember, kids, there were a lot of parties and movements besides the NSDAP from 1918-1933.) Mustache Guy originally wanted a Bolshevik/Mussolini style seizure of power, which is exactly what the Munich Putsch of November 1923 was. Only afterwards did he switch tactics to the legal, electoral method that did succeed, but he always made sure that his party stalwarts understood that this never meant legitimizing Wiemar democracy, only that it was to be used as a tool to ultimately destroy it.

                    Joey Junger:  Minor quibble ‚Äì I want Pelosi‚Äôs multiple face lifts to come undone ‚Äì for her face to essentially ‚Äòmelt‚Äô in public.  What matters most to her (besides power and publicity) is vanity, so that‚Äôs what I want to see targeted.  Then she can die of fluid-filled lungs.On a more serious note, you are correct.  The old guard (primarily White and small hats with a smattering of POX grifters) thinks they have the new brigade under control for now.  But wait 5-10 years, as things continually decay in Numerica, and see who ends up running things.  I think the old guard‚Äôs kids and political heirs (not the same thing) will be surprised, although they unfortunately are rather well cushioned from said consequences by the lucre their parents cronyed away for decades.

            I‚Äôve been saying for awhile that our rulers are at the height of their power right now. They‚Äôve inherited still functioning institutions with legacy workers who make the systems work.The military, the FBI, intelligence agencies, local law enforcement, they‚Äôre all still mostly staffed by non-insane, competent Whites. But this will change bit by bit over the next decade or so.As Z noted in his Sunday show, some police forces are already feeling the pinch as officer retire or quit. A similar process will happen across institutions as differing speeds. Competent Whites will retire or find other, less groveling jobs. They will be replaced by incompetent non-Whites or woke Whites (who are also incompetent).The system will suffer.What that means, unfortunately, is that Whites should keep their heads down for the time being. Organize quietly, but don‚Äôt make any moves. The system will never be as strong as it is now. This is not the time to take it on.

        The truly aggravating aspect of the Blackrock Group,(I think that‚Äôs their name), hovering up entire subdivisions at above market prices is that;1) they are being financed by the Fed, which is the dirt people‚Äôs money, and2) If somehow there is a collapse and Blackrock gets in trouble, they will be bailed out by, you guessed it, your money.
Either way, the peons will pay.
If I‚Äôm wrong, please set me straight, and get your finances straight before the great Reset, I mean collapse.

            Normally, if Blackrock and the other gigantic asset management firms buy up homes and overpay, that‚Äôs a huge risk for them, because the bubble would burst.  But of course they‚Äôll be bailed out.  They can do as they please.

            The other problem with BlackRock is that every thrifty saver who reads Z-Man gives 5 to 20 percent of their annual income to them through IRA or 401k contributions.  If you invest in an index fund (which you should), the odds are high that the fund is run by your friends at Blackrock.
Of course, it IS a free country and you can always create your own tax-protected, highly liquid, multi-asset, exchange traded fund.
Trust me, I have tried to figure out an alternative, but absent collapse, I don‚Äôt see a solution to this.

                Maybe there is.Mortgages- our houses will become our 401ks, as they were until 2008.Follow the big fish.The trend is your friend.If the rest of our overpopulating world depends on America-the-Shopping-Mall to keep their suffocating economies going, then even our fake money retains its position.It‚Äôs simply changed in the ‚Äòvalue‚Äô it represents- future cash flows, instead of past sunk costs.I‚Äôm getting a small mortgage to pay off in the next year, to buy Dad‚Äôs house in Dallas for a brother.  Family ownership is what Patel does- they get loans from their relatives already here, and keep buying homes/businesses for each new arrival.  If it works for Chinese generals, then it works, as long as it works.I had the same in mind when I bought Mom‚Äôs house on credit cards- of course, I did that right before the Mortgage Meltdown, so don‚Äôt be overextended when they cut your credit lines back to existing debt and erase your emergency buffer.A safe way would be these REITs that are becoming all the rage: ‚Äúinvest in our pool of rental properties, we do the rest.‚Äù  Some are promising a return of 10% without the migraines of trying to be a hands-on landlord, with better a much quality of housing available, too.  I‚Äôd ride the elephant‚Äôs back instead of pulling its plow.

                    Absolutely no way these REITS can run 10% return on  SFR.  Between vacancy rates and cap expenditures from tenant turnover, the investment might best case run 5% which keeps up with inflation.  Granted, if you have annual inflation of 10% in housing prices then you can pump up your returns for a few years but the next downturn in the economy will puncture that bubble PDQ.  Even counting on a FED bailout, this entry of wall st into main st real estate is going to end horribly, 2008 on steroids.

                The solution is they just sold us the rope. When the time comes, the new right will force the exproproation of all corporation-owned housing and returning it to our people.

                Mr. Black and Mr. Rock arent out buying up homes at FU prices.Its just moar capital thrust into the hands of super smart finance guys running their regional shops like good smart capitalists do.The right seems to fixate on boogymen almost as bad as the left when the problem involves reflecting upon ones own participation in the charade. There are many tentacles indeed.Ten years ago I was outbid on auction, foreclosed, piece of shit condos and homes repeatedly by all-cash super smart and savvy private investors who were buying to flip and/or paint-n-carpet then rent SFR.Then there were the short term rental guys. First it was normie moneyizing his spare room or basement or borrowing against ‚Äúhome equity‚Äù for cheap to build over the garage and rent air bnb.Then smarter hustlers syndicated capital and bought up multiple homes and units to put into the STR market. Everybody loved it. Especially the realtors. Ours is an era of the middleman after all.‚ÄúHot‚Äù RE markets make everybody feelz good. Recession over! Until scale takes over (again) i guess.Flippers and STR‚Äôs/ADUs were crushing working class and first time buyers long before the dark lords made the alt-press.Same goes for Billy Gates and his farmland.Every asset in every market is subject to the same underlying rigging.Homes are suddenly a touchy issue which is interesting but not new.We long ago decided that money and markets were more important than our people.The narrow elites and the fat normies eat from the same trough.One is just well downstream from the other. I despise those elites. But I also spent 20 years working in one of those hives.I dont know which is more stupid. To complain about how the biggest tentacle is cockblocking yours or to not even play the game and have nothing to talk about at the BBQ.

                    I agree that the house flipping thing has been going on for a long time. They have had cable TV shows about it for years. While it may be legal and make perfect financial sense for individual investors it has no doubt harmed young families looking for their first starter home.
Now we have corporations who are no doubt acting as fronts for Uncle Sam, using unlimited funds to sieze control of YTs last remaining stronghold, the suburbs.
