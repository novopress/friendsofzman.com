        “If you look closely, you will see this dynamic everywhere. The offset to those cheap products at big-box stores is the collapse of American manufacturing, and the social capital that came with it. The offset to cheap labor via immigration has been stagnant wages and emergency rooms that resemble Tijuana bus stops. The offset to a rising stock market is endless financial insecurity. The hidden costs have accumulated to the point where they can no longer be ignored.”Beautifully put. And if you look beyond the imported goods, at services that have to be supplied by the local labor force, you get a better idea of how eviscerated social capital has become. If I visit a doctor, the chances are good it will be someone from the Indian subcontinent rather than a white man. I’m actually better off financially and health-wise going across the border to Mexico for medical or dental care. Plus I save the anxiety and ulcers that come with the bureaucracy and paperwork — I think 75%-80% of healthcare costs must be getting siphoned off this way, with only a minuscule fraction actually going to real medical care. The USA in large measure is now a third-world country thinly camouflaged by the glitz of imported products. Living in the USA is becoming more and more of a nightmare for the average denizen.

            the great lie of “free trade ” is that it supplies cheaper goods. That rests on the assumption that the companies selling the goods will pass the lower costs of Chinese goods on to the consumer. This is not the case. when converse shoes were mad in america they were $29.99 a pair. now that they are made in china, they are they are $60.00.Chuck Taylor All Star EVA Lift Canvas Platform. Which is why tariffs are nowhere near as inflationary as our media is predicting.

That’s difficult to believe. Are you saying there is not one joooo or globalist who saw the opportunity to make $30 a pair and didn’t say, “No, hard pass.”

                        No, I mean if there were just one mathematically competent person in the US, wouldn’t he have created a company that produced shoes that capitalized on that $30 spread? If you are correct, heck, I should look into it.
Can’t believe my guy has me chasing opportunities of 50% when there’s 100+% in the offing. I’ll fire his ass tomorrow morning.

                            If I were wrong the store would be filled with bargians and the  last 10 years whel everything went to china would have been deflationary. we would all be marveling at how cheap things were getting.

        Those last two sentences are WORD.  The fed printing $$$ out of thin air the past twenty years in particular have led us to this point – DOW 45,000, the Celtics being “worth” 6 billion and supposedly self-made billionaires no one has ever heard of…

                Z:“In a country with serious problems that require elite investment, watching rich parasites plow billions into a human flea circus brings revolutionary thoughts to mind. It may be the last grotesque gesture of an economic model that has run its course.“The Celtics were a j00ish franchise going back almost forever. [cf (((Red Auerbach)))].The fact that the j00z were willing to walk away from the franchise [and dump it in the laps of the idiot goyim] would tend to indicate that the j00z don’t see much money to be made in Diversity Inclusion Equity anymore.A stunning example of that was on display, this past weekend, in the NCAA Final Four, when a kneegrow referee called a foul on Duke University’s White superstar, Cooper Flagg, and all the protestations of the j00ish coach of Duke, (((Jon Scheyer))), were for naught; the kneegr0w referee simply ignored the j00.I think the j00z are prepping to try to become “White” again.October 7th spooked the hell outta the j00z.And it’s probably why the Council of the Sanhedrin voted to allow Trump to become president again [the Council ordered Mark Phuckerberg, in no uncertain terms, to back the hell off and invent ZERO fake ballots this time around].

                    I have wondered why the Deep State allowed Trump to return to office. Your explanation is a good one.
I never thought the Hamas attack on Oct-7-2023 was such a big deal. I just assumed that Israel was using it as an excuse to kill more Arabs and to steal more land.
However, if you’re right, it means the J00z really were freaked out about it – enough to call a truce to their war against the White Race. So that’s good news for Whites – I guess.

                        If the big jews (or enough of them) have decided they are on Team Whitey, then how long before they are on Team Mass Deportations? If they got behind that, then it could really happen. It doesn’t seem to me any more far fetched than their getting on Team Trump would have seemed 8 years ago. They are already down with deporting anyone who says anything nice about palestinians/negative about jews.

                            I would be shocked to ever see any such revolution. Getting rid of the vocal anti-Zionists is one thing, getting rid of the Third World masses they have so long worked to stock the country with would be quite another.

                        I suspect the bigger issue was that all those videos of mutilated children were threatening the programming of the goodwhites in the West so planting Zion Don to put the boot on the libs’ necks was the most logical path to retaining control and maintaining the supply of goyish childflesh to bake into matzah.

I just assumed that Israel was using it as an excuse to kill more Arabs and to steal more land.”I don’t think the attack itself was such a big deal in their eyes. I would be surprised if the Israeli government did NOT know it was coming and I think it likely that they deliberately let it happen (dead childless raving druggies serve their people more in death than they ever did in life), so that they had Casus Belli they could wave around to justify preplanned Gaza operations.It was the complete lack of kneejerk support for them afterwards, all over the West, that shook them. What little they had came from the very people they are trying hardest to genocide. They hate us more than they love their own children. That will not change this side of 5,000 more years of genetic and memetic co-evolution.

                            That’s what I see Horace. It wasn’t the attack that rattled them, it was the “left’s” reaction to it that did. The people they thought were their allies. This is one of the things that social media permits: a quicker assessment of the zeitgeist (rightly or wrongly) than was available in the before times

                    The NBA was always a Jewish enterprise, and basketball remains highly popular with Jews. The movie “Uncut Gems”, which is the most overtly Jewish movie in recent memory (after “A Serious Man”), is largely about the intersection of American Jews and basketball.
I didn’t think of the ethnic makeup of the Celtics buyer, but in response I will say that the Mavericks were sold, last year, from one Jew to another.

If people understood how private equity operated there would be immediate revolution.
Private equity literally wishes money into existence through their over-inflated valuations on assets.
Mitt Romney and Bain are an excellent case study for those interested.

                    The template is probably Ivan Boesky (on whom the fictitious Gordon Gekko is based). If we look at other decaying empires in the modern period — Dutch, British — they go through a period of parasite financialisation before finally flickering out. Finance is the empty and lifeless husk of what once a living social and economic organism.

                            Reminds me of Anthony Trollope’sThe Way We Live Now, a novel that satirized the financial piracy rampant in 1870s England. Trollope wrote, concerning the book:Nevertheless a certain class of dishonesty, dishonesty magnificent in its proportions, and climbing into high places, has become at the same time so rampant and so splendid thatthere seems to be reason for fearing that men and women will be taught to feel that dishonesty, if it can become splendid, will cease to be abominable. If dishonesty can live in a gorgeous palace with pictures on all its walls, and gems in all its cupboards, with marble and ivory in all its corners, and can give Apician dinners, and get into Parliament, and deal in millions, then dishonesty is not disgraceful, and the man dishonest after such a fashion is not a low scoundrel.Emphasis added. Has a familiar ring, doesn’t it?

                                That’s a great novel, and the four-part TV adaptation is also well worth watching. Melmotte, incidentally, belongs to the tribe. Trollope desrcribes how the City of London — increasingly dominated by the tribe — was encroaching onto the preserve of landed gentry and aristocracy.

This is completely pedantic, but I had always thought that Gekko was based on corporate raider Michael Miliken, or a composite of Miliken, Boesky, and Carl Icahn. Probably not important in the grand scheme of things.

                        The Fed always gets the blame, but at most it just makes the problem a little worse. The proximate cause of the problem is Congress’ refusal to act responsibly. The Fed then has to accommodate Congress’ profligacy, without it impacting core inflation. The only answer anyone has come up with far is to make sure the Cantillon Effect is primarily limited to goods not in the core CPI — stocks, hedges, yachts, private jets, etc.
Until Congress is reined in, let’s keep the asset bubbles and price inflation limited to those who are rich enough to afford it.

That’s because the Fed is THE ONLY ENTITY which can create fake money out of thin air.
If there’s fake money in the system, then necessarily it must be coming from the Fed.
All the other entities have to sit back and wait their turn at the trough.
All fake money begins at the Fed.

Same with your mortgage, same when you write a check, same when you whip out your credit card.But everyone is looking for someone else to pin the blame on, rather than looking in the mirror.

Yes. But in aggregate, they never are. Whenever you pay off a car loan, there’s always at least one sucker willing to take on another.
The same would be true if gov’t paid down the debt.Cet. par., money supply would contract. It’s an open question whether private money creation would make up the difference to keep, say, M2 constant. It’s never been tried, but the incentive for private money creation to fill the gap would exist.

EDIT: Unless there are some GrayBeard Gnomes in the ether who are using their ancient COBOL wizardry to hack new fake money out of the ancient COBOL fake money database.
I’ve often wondered where that particular server lives; the Ur-Server of Fiat Electrons.
Maybe in Armonk?
Unless Honeywell got the contract for storing the fiat electrons, way back circa 1955, in which case, the Old Lady would be churning away in Morristown, NJ?

                When I was a kid, folks generally admired millionaires, acknowledging their hard work and PRODUCTIVE contributions to society.
Now billionaires are everywhere, people who basically learned to game and grift the system. They aren’t admired by aware folks, and shouldn’t be because they are takers, not contributors or givers.

                    This is why I find myself saying “damn, you sound like a commie” (about myself) when talking about the modern high net worth people like billionaires.  All the famous ones are just con men. Then they use those ill gotten gains to promote the most evil causes.The old equivalents of billionaires vastly improved the lives of their customers.  Henry Ford put a model T in millions of driveways and rockerfeller had brought down the price of Kerosene for lighting and the gas to run the T.  This class built libraries and other stuff for the public benefit.  They are not without their problems, but they are way better than what we have today.

                        This is why the term “symbol manipulators” was invented.  It frames perfectly those elites who produce nothing material for the benefit of society, but rather juggle numbers and accumulate wealth through arbitrage.

                            The symbols manipulated are far more than numbers.Status, virtue, identity, story themes, moral values, desires, fears, measurements, comparison, history, perception, reality…our sex, the spirit within, and everything that makes us human.We’re being molded, bred, and retuned to a different frequency.One that is a twisted, faulty caricature of what we are born with…trapping us here, along with the rest. We are their only chance to escape, we are being instinctively hijacked in a doomed effort.Hell’s function is to pull every form of structure back in, material or immaterial, to shred it, break it down, recompose it, due to the sparcity of material in the paper thin living layer.It is a different drumbeat, a different force operating inside the greenhouse, than the great forces of Creation that made the greenhouse, which our kind hears most clearly.Two Gods, not One.

Allusions to this always make me laugh. What could be easier than going to some park, collecting acorns or walnuts or those helicopter things that maples drop, and planting them? One of the holes even gives you a place to leave the dog poop you have in that bag in your pocket.
And, yet, it’s supposed to be some grandiose sacrifice.

Bible harps on no cheating or scamming the poor folk, no thumb on the scale, unless you want to get stomped by the experts.  Bonus points in Scripture if you help out the poor folks and so forth.
Also says don’t lust after wealth as it’ll send ya in the wrong direction, down the death roads instead towards life.
It all seems pretty plain to me.

Walt was much more than he seemed.  I will leave it at that.  At least they made wholesome and instructive (to kids) movies in the old days.
Rockefeller, like Rothschild, smells like evil to me.

                            “… call me a commie or a meanie, yawn.”I feel the same way. Everything is on the table. I’ve been a fanatic anti-communist since I read “The Gulag Archipelago” when I was 15. Too bad I didn’t follow it up with the part he left out but wrote about later in “200 Years Together” or I might have redpilled much earlier.Communism is certainly not the best system, but what made the early Soviet Union a horror is that it was created by Jews and the foolish goyim who admired them. If the 2nd ‘Russian’ Revolution had been thwarted, the entire world would be a better place today.

                    “When I was a kid, folks generally admired millionaires, acknowledging their hard work and PRODUCTIVE contributions to society.”
There’s usually been some ambivalence towards the very rich. For example the sceptical attitude towards the 19th century robber barons, which culminated in the anti-trust movement of Teddy Roosevelt in the early years of the 20th century. Or the expose of the meat-packing industry in Upton Sinclair’s 1906 book, “The Jungle” (which might turn you into a vegetarian). The cheerleading usually comes from the likes of Ayn Rand and her ilk, where unfettered capitalism is the best of all possible worlds.

                        As with respect towards Ayn Rand, she’d have decried today’s billionaires.  Yes, she had a hard on for capitalists, but never symbol manipulators (see above).  All of Ayn Rand’s hero’s produced material things for the benefit of society.  All government bureaucrats were the antagonists whom she called “moochers”.  I see nothing in today’s political landscape to contradict her insight of 60+ years ago.

                            She comes with far too much baggage for me.  She was a repugnant person.  Probably not unrelated, her actual name was Rosenbaum.  I despise so-called stage names.  It makes me think they are either ashamed of their heritage, whatever it happens to be or that they are hiding something.  Given what an anti-Christian bigot she was, she didn’t want people to know her name was Rosenbaum.  Even where she had good ideas, it always comes off bad.  Her one good point is she was a major anti-Communist.

At one time Abraham was the wealthiest man within a thousand miles, tho wealth then was measured in land and livestock, not moolah. Yet, God loved the guy so much He even upgraded his name.

                            Abraham was a slaveraider who tried to murder his Lord and take his throne rather than obey the order to cease his raids on peaceful neighbors.
Abraham was the Lucifer, the right hand, growing immensely rich and powerful enough to recruit one third of the nobles, off of abusing his government position.
Some saw him as a lesson…others, as an example.
When he had to take his clans and flee into the wasteland, they asked, “How did we get here?” He showed them how to answer that question, as well…lie your ass off and blame a ficticious someone else.

It’s a novel, not a documentary. And it’s a novel for a reason — he couldn’t back up all his scandalous claims if he claimed it was all fact.

                        That’s because there is something admirable about a man who can bring raw materials into one end of a building and spit out cheap manufactured goods out of the other end.  They massively increased the number of cheap goods we could buy and the variety.  “What will they think of next” was a common saying in the 20th century.I’m not overly romantic about these people.  They were generally brutal masters doing things like speeding up the lines to try to get more work out of their workers. Paying shit wages.  Taking someone off the premises when a machine removed a workers arm or something and leaving him to his fate.I read that book a long time ago, probably for school, but I just don’t recall.  I don’t believe 90% of what was in it.  As another commenter pointed out, it was released a fiction story rather than an investigative journalism book.

                How, exactly, are we worse off? Yachts and private jets and mansions and sports leagues are priced even further out of our means? So? What makes us worse off is when more modest housing, and transportation, and groceries go up.CPI is not tied to increased distance between the rich and poor, but rather from attempts to reduce that gap. Rich people don’t buy more butter than I do, unless they bathe in it or something. The price of butter goes up because people in our wealth category have more money to spend on butter, so we do.Want to make things better for the next generation? Sop paying stupid inflated prices for your cars and houses. If you stop bidding up prices, they stop going up.

                    This is the part of the Boomer hate I understand. People with bushel-baskets of money show up and distort local markets. Happened in the Pacific Northwest when Californians took their equity and moved somewhere else. Happened in Aspen and Jackson Hole.And, yet, people seem to have a blind spot when it comes to accepting that their own actions have the same effect. The fact that I can go into a car dealership or call a home renovation company and write a check does not mean it’s a good idea. Without my business bidding up the price of their goods and services, it’s more affordable for those of lesser means.

                            But at least that part is true. He did earn it, and only green-eyed envy would gainsay that, or feel oppressed by it.
What I object to are the people I see in daily life who go on and on about how “we” are screwing the next generation, when in reality, it’s he and those like him who is doing it.

                        It’s not only inflationary purchases that are wrongheaded, but also the purchase of the wrong things. Hence, any white guy who takes the family to see Snow White–or most other anti-white Hollywood garbage–is casting a vote for anti-white racism. Purchasing Bud Lite and Gillette products is a vote for sexual deviance. And so on and so forth. The dollar is a ballot. How it is cast can encourage or discourage. The choice is in the hands of the consumer.

                            All true, but it’s very hard to navigate through today’s woke mine field.  For example, I never use self-checkout.  However there are businesses opening up that don’t take cash.  Indeed, the legislation here tried to pass a bill to mandate the taking of cash in addition to CC.

And it’s not like there’s a corner store in Ponca City where ma and pa are turning out running shoes. If you really have to have running shoes, you have little choice but to fund afroglobohomo.

Don’t buy swill from A-B, or any megacorp. Buy decent stuff from Tim’s son whose name I always forget who owns a small microbrewery. But not that IPA crap. Buy something to encourage him to make something that tastes like beer.
Don’t go to Snow White and the Seven Audience Members. Most smaller towns have an open mike night, and you can enjoy the local talent.

            There was a comment I read at James Howard Kunstler’s site 10 or 15 years ago which has stuck with me all this time for some reason. The commenter said something about how the DOW would be hitting 40k while every city had bread lines.
At the time it seemed like absurd hyperbole. But every time I take my car to the shop, the food bank across the street has a line 20 people deep, and Jim Cramer still has a job arfing like a seal when the line goes up.

                    Don’t forget the aspect of professional sportsball players becoming more and more political as their fame and income increased.  Why would Whites continue to support an entertainment venue that hates them?  The book “Shut Up and Sing: How Elites from Hollywood, Politics, and the UN Are Subverting America” was written by Laura Ingraham. It was published in 2003 and it seems we are only just catching wise two decades later.  Sigh….

                    It’s been over a quarter century since I paid any heed to the NBA, but I’m aware of it peripherally, and I get the impression that the league is nowhere as negroid as it used to be. A large number of Europeans in the NBA now, and many of them are among the best in the league.
But you’re otherwise right. It sounds very much like they’re playing the dullest basketball possible.

                    That was the last straw for me.  We had a charity that I brought my son to when he was young.  It catered to the least and the lost wrt homeless men.  Well today that charity has gone big time and actually advertises drive through food service.  Yep, no need to sit at a communal table, say prayers, and break bread with fellow tracelers.  Now the whole family can hop in the car and get volunteer prepared and packaged bags of cooked food.Wrote my last check to them a number of years ago and never looked back after hearing their Thanksgiving advertisement for this new service?

                        Moms, a poor woman on SSI, had built a food bank at our little nearby farmtown, run by the aging local wives at the church.
(I didn’t know this, actually. She said nothing when we went a couple times; I was bemused at how all the gals greeted her.)
So, our last trip there, we exited with a small bag of goodies…and right by the door, were two bums, a man and a woman, arguing about their larger bags.
The bank folded shortly after that; this was during the Bush years, when “homelessness” was all the Democrat rage.

        The American economy has become a financialized, coin-shaving Ponzi scheme because Americans have rejected the Protestant Ethic in favor of the Jewish ethic of huckstering and swindling.Karl Marx got it right in his essay“On the Jewish Question”:“What is the worldly religion of the Jew?Huckstering. What is his worldly God?Money.Very well then! Emancipation fromhucksteringandmoney, consequently from practical, real Judaism, would be the self-emancipation of our time.…We recognize in Judaism, therefore, a generalanti-socialelement of thepresent time, an element which through historical development – to which in this harmful respect the Jews have zealously contributed – has been brought to its present high level, at which it must necessarily begin to disintegrate.…The Jew has emancipated himself in a Jewish manner, not only because he has acquired financial power, but also because, through him and also apart from him,moneyhas become a world power and the practical Jewish spirit has become the practical spirit of the Christian nations. The Jews have emancipated themselves insofar as the Christians have become Jews.”Americans, like Jews, believe they are special, indispensable, deserve something for nothing, don’t have to produce anything of value, and are entitled to bomb the shit out of hapless Third Worlders.This explains the power of Jews in American society — the post-Christian Americans have chosen to emulate them.

            Which Protestant ethic? I think you are talking about the Scandinavian / German Protestant ethic. If you’re talking about the Brits, piracy and finance has always been their bailiwick.
For that matter, I’ve always been confused as to why the Anglicans are lumped in with the rest of protestantism. To me, they are just dissident Catholics.

                I associate England with the agricultural/industrial/scioentific revolutions which allowed England to become wealthy.
Piracy in the 15th and 16th centuries was pioneered by the northern French. Financial games in that era would be the Dutch and northern Italians especially the House of Savoie. The Spanish theft of American silver could also be called piracy; the financial chicanery which the silver aided broke the Spanish empire in the 17th century.
If you’re talkin’ piracy being in the blood then we might need to talk about the Vikings.

            Where I live the city built the basketball stadium, pays the teams to use it (the WNBA team, too), and shares the whole neighborhood’s parking revenue with them. This includes parking when the stadium is put to other use (which events are said to more than offset the sports subsidy, though that’s not numerically possible), and for all the nearby businesses that the NBA’s presence supposedly sustains (it doesn’t).That barely begins to describe how fake the “market” is. For example, if you buy a ticket for a summer league game—which are so unpopular I’ve been assumed to be part of the team because I was there and over six feet tall; these tiny get-togethers take the place of other possible stadium-filling events—you get free tickets for real games they know won’t sell. Wanna watch the Hornets lose to the last five guys on the bench? No? We’ll count you anyway.Attendance is up!I assume this isn’t unusual.

                My hometown of 8,000 souls has a public high school of aproximately 900 students. Our h.s. football stadium seats 5,000 plus overflow. We have similarly-sized basketball and hockey facilities despite we are a swimming, golf and tennis school.When did the US dedicate its public school monies to athletics at this scale?If you read Wiki, there is a long list of athletes set forth under the usual school information followed by politicians and actors. Noteworthy inventors, scientists and academic contributors are listed elsewhere if you bother to click on a link, which nobody does.Why do we prioritize sports here and try so hard to feed our young to the sports entertainment industry when this is a dead end and enormous time waster for nearly all “athletes?”I played, but it never really made sense to me why we were doing it. Why we lionized athletes in hope they could serve briefly our gazillionaire masters.

                    “Why do we prioritize sports here and try so hard to feed our young to the sports entertainment industry when this is a dead end and enormous time waster for nearly all “athletes?””
Although it has always been this way to an extent, I suspect a bit of AA here wrt Blacks.  Where else can we pump such money into minority uplift than to promote about the only aspect the race has some superiority in—sports.

                        There is certainly AA with regard to black coaches. And when promoted beyond their limited abilities, they fail. I’m sure the failure rate of black head coaches at the major college and professional levels is far higher than the white failure rate–even factoring in that the negroes have a much longer leash before getting fired–but you’ll never see the NY Times do a story on that.

                    As with everything else, it’s when people or groups with more money than God show up and distort local economies. In the case of school sports venues, it’s usually the damn government trying to figure out what to spend all that tax money on, so they can get the kickbacks from the contractors.
It’s not about the sports. Its about the skim.

                        There’s a reason they enshrined “education” in the state constitutions, and forgot about teaching kids useful skills or how to read.
How’s that end?  In rich old people moving to Idaho, and poor old people shivering in ghetto slums because they can’t sell their house.

                            I agree, but I have a hard time feeling sorry for oldsters so set in their ways that they can’t see the handwriting on the wall. If you have to wait until your kids graduate from the high school you should not have sentenced them to in the first place, OK. But after that, if you stuck around based on nostalgia for how it used to be, sorry, no fucks to give.If he really cared about the future generations, he’d have moved to a locale small enough that he could make a difference, and worked to keep the place as it was.But the ones I really hate… nope. If @Zman addresses them, which I doubt, I’ll comment then.

                    Because it’s a huge Mammon maker, another grift.
That’s what school bonds are really “investing” in, not in teaching living skills to the next generation.
Those “investors” in school bonds demand a quick return. The municipal pension portfolios depend on it.
And so does the paycheck of the portfolio managers offering this service to the state senator.
The portfolio manager will first fill out the senator’s paperwork to open a “private investment group”, then walk him and his fellow senators through what choices of “investments” they have, be it local school stadiums or section 8 “redevelopment” deals.

            I think the WNBA was subsidized by the NBA and USAID, and nobody ever watched that for more than 5 minutes. College softball and volleyball is more popular (for obvious reasons.)
So the NBA is untouchable. I doubt it would fail…it’s basically Chrysler, Olive Garden, and Radio Shack all rolled into one irrelevant monstrosity.

        That ESPN tax model is quickly falling apart. Cable penetration is down to 40% when it used to be 90%. Of course, people are streaming, which is cable in another form, but the combined numbers these days are nowhere near 90%. Way too many people have also dropped cable in favor of Netflix or similar services which also lack the ESPN tax.I think what’s really going on is that the purchasers are “betting” that legalization of sports gambling is going to replace that TV revenue. Future revenue growth is going to come from gambler degenerates.Lately, I’ve been of the mind that nobody really cares about pro sports anyway. (At least not to the degree it is talked about in the media.) The gambler degenerates are the people who drive all the conversation and it always has been that way since even Roman times.Exactly 4 years ago this month is when I cut cable TV. I figure I’ve saved $6,000 since then. I still buy internet from that company. Here’s the kicker: They’ve had unscrambled standard definition cable TV coming over the same wire all along. I was paying all those years when I didn’t have to. Here’s the other kicker: I barely watch it. (They recently cut it off as they converted to IPTV, but four free years was still a good run.)All that said, even though the ratings are pathetic compared to 20 years ago, sportsball is still rated higher than anything else on TV. I don’t know what the thinking is. Maybe they’re afraid you’ll forget about linear TV at this point unless you have sportsball as your loss leader. (Confirmed to me by a former radio executive that they used to lose money on their sports contracts, but they used it to drive listeners to other programming.) So, maybe it’s like buy one get one free soda at Kroger’s.

            The using sports to drive viewers to other programming model doesn’t work anymore. Traditional prime time TV ratings are at all time lows.  The top shows now have fewer viewers than the 30th ranked show did in 2000.  I have heard an argument that the drug companies buy a lot of ads in part to prevent news divisions from running negative reports on them. Even with cable TV revenue I don’t see how this model continues to work.  Once the cable revenue completely dries how do they fake it anymore?

        I thought of these two items:The Celtics do not own their arena, so they lack that asset to supplement their business. Most likely, the franchise is a money-loser by conventional standards.The reason regular people feel so much economic angst, despite the appearance of material prosperity, is that we have reached the end of the line for this model, where costs are socialized but profits are privatized.Even though the Celtics don’t own their arena, they probably didn’t have to pay for it directly. As we all know, city and state governments deem it SO ESSENTIAL that they have a sportsball franchise they will levy special funding packages, paid for by taxpayers, to build a new stadium, or upgrade the existing facility. Which means people who will never attend a game or don’t care about sports will be forking out some cash to build a big stadium.That and the old saw of “Naming Rights”. Finding some suckers to put their name on a building for cashola. (Of course I’m an auto racing fan, we did it first with cars so I can’t point fingers and shame. 😏)I think of last year when the Chicago White Sox, who were THE WORST team in the MLB, reaching historic levels of awfulness (They almost broke the record for most losses by an MLB team PERIOD), and yet asking for a new stadium payed for by the already broke Chicago taxpayer.Even though they haven’t 100% paid off the loans to build the new Comiskey Park they opened in 1991.That’s chutzpah!﻿

            Remember how in 2020 all “nonessential” things were shut down but the NFL, MLB, and NBA still played? The regime takes an interest in seeing that the circuses go on. It’s a high priority.   To them, it’s “essential.” Which explains their eagerness to fund it with public money.

                That isn’t quite right. The NBA season was stopped in March and didn’t resume until October where it was held in a “bubble” where no one was supposed to get in or out.  There were several scandals around it as many players were sneaking in comfort women.  After the riots in honor of St. George Floyd it was obvious having sports resume to distract the rioters was a smart move. Yet there was still major resistance to having the games, college football was delayed and teams played a shortened schedule.

                Unfortunately, that’s the way it seems to work. Universities use sports as marketing for their institutions. They call it their front porch. Cities use it for the same reason. It’s like naming rights on an arena. It just gets you exposure.At the University level, think of sports ball as a Halo product. It’s like the Chevy Corvette or the Dodge Viper.  Likewise with cities who use it to market themselves. It’s also very cost-effective compared to having to pay for that kind of marketing.It is a powerful marketing tool, especially at the local level. Ohio State, for example, always had the best or second best graduate and masters programs in the state depending on the area of study, but at the undergrad level was more of a drinking school. In large part because of the unprecedented success of the football program, they’ve been able to ride it to academic success. Ohio State is now maybe a half step removed from the Michigans of academia.Rutgers was a decent school but has now ridden big time sports to where they are ranked as the 15th best public university, right there with Ohio State. (They may suck overall, but they are in the Big Ten.)So, a lot of smart people are making these decisions and there are benefits that we may not necessarily appreciate. However, as a general principle, I don’t like welfare for billionaires either.

                    Interestingly, the big sports schools, particularly in the SEC, have become magnets for smart white boys who have basically been frozen out by the Ivies and near-Ivies. Sports are a big part of the social scene, but it’s not the “Animal  House” of 30 or 40 years ago. Getting a marketable education is the priority.
As an added bonus, the girls are prettier and more feminine. Very entitled, though.

                            I’ve often wondered if that connection most of us see between a woman being attractive and being nuts has to do with something lacking with them emotionally or mentally, so they overcompensate by working hard on their appearance.

                            And they are rarified too and they know it. As the population becomes more and more brown and swarthy the white girls who are still thin and attractive are becoming unicorns.Where I am, Eastern Europe? Every 3rd one is like this and every 5th one is model hot and I’m not even kidding. It is an odd thing here this abundance of smoking hot women who also happen to be economically depressed. This is a good place to be a a single man, perhaps the best place. But many of them are ruthless mercenaries and know JUST how to dial you in and what to say.So you cannot be some beta chump who has never had female attention she will clean your wallet out lickety split. The trick here is NEVER ever ever take them back to the States or even to Western Europe.You keep them here and they are well behaved. If you are marginally attractive and fit you only need to open your mouth, that American accent has a lot of cache in this part of the world still. You are exotic here. Not as much as perhaps 10-15 years ago, but more than you may imagine.Just having a conversation out in a public place in fluent English with a native accent the level of interest in me is high because its so rare here.If Trump really wanted to make America Great Again, he would grant visas to all EE women between the ages of 18-35 or so as long as they become willing concubines and brides upon arrival for a set period like 10 years at least or they are returned to their country of origin immediately.Would completely fix the broken American Woman problem straight away.

        It isn’t just emergency rooms. Go to once pristine national parks where you could once canoe peacefully down a beautiful forest lined river with your love. You could watch the eagles and ospreys fly overhead and then stop on a bank and have a peaceful picnic – maybe make out a little and keep the flame alive.Now, the banks are littered with garbage and hordes of screaming kids and an extended family of muy gordita grandparents and endless uncles aunts. They blast their goofy music that sounds like a car alarm going off as someone is trying to break the glass with a tin spoon tapping the clave.I looked up Chisholm. His partner at Symphony is Romesh Wadwhani. Wadwhani another billionaire who makes your head scratch about how exactly he made billions, sits on the board of the JFK Center For the Arts and The Center For Strategic Studies in our now destroyed nation’s former capital. He invests in AI by having a foundation for “ethical” development of AI that is investing the money in Mumbai. His foundation also invests in developing skill/talent in our University System. In other words, Wadwhani is a colonizer who used our financialized economy to buy power in our country and who exports our wealth and invests in our posterity’s replacements.Chisholm is his buddy. Looking at his Wiki it seems that he has an encyclopedic knowledge of the Celtics history. So there you have the bugmen who sold out Our Civilization. A little boy who has the mixture of psychopathy and cognitive reasoning to network and profit from the selling off of his and our inheritance. Now wealthy, as Wadwhani invests in non-Americans, Chisholm plays out his childhood fantasy owning the flea circus of wealthy savages playing a child’s game. Wadwhani has even colonized his son-in-law whose job is to work at his foundation that works to strengthen the outsider.This is the essence of Western man and the post WWII system that embrace the Enlightenment’s pathology. Some empire huh. You know it is popular to blame one group, and they deserve their share of blame. However, Western man only has himself to blame for selling off his inheritance. Well, to be fair it is the bugmen like Chisholm who sell all of us out.This interpretation of Inception is well worth the 12 minutes. I highly suggest Mr. Stagg’s interpretation of, “Candyman”, as well. We have been abandoned. It is up to us to save ourselves while Chisholm squanders his printed money fulfilling his fantasy by buying his participation in a child’s game played by racial aliens who are hostile to he and his kind. This video is a lot of food for thought. The best guy I have seen in a long time. It may be worth a share.https://odysee.com/@WyattStagg:e/Inceptionandtheempireofourfathers:8From the epilogue:“What were the conditions that made ethnic Europeans vulnerable to the operation of this mental malware? From its beginnings, the liberal idea which emerged from the collapse of the Medieval Order had sought to free the autonomous individuals from the strictures of tribe, tradition and history. It aspired to this outcome as a moral imperative on the basis of the belief in the inviable sovereignty of the human conscience. Within this ethical paradigm, all racial and cultural bonds constitute unjust impositions on the free person and his unrestricted right to determine his own destiny.In our efforts to realize these ideals we surrender our wealth and power. They seize it for themselves unhindered by the feeble moral misgivings they have nurtured in our consciousness, but against which they have been inoculated. The source of our disquietude is not the burden of our history or the guilt of its deeds, but the creeping sense that in relinquishing our birth rite, we may have squandered the greatest gifts. It is the fear that should we fail to act, the 3000 year project of our fathers will, within our lifetimes, meet its end.”

        I have long been baffled by the continued increase in valuation of NBA teams and the increased value of TV contracts, considering ratings have totally cratered. None of the arguments put forward by NBA shills pass the smell test, in fact all the other sports – including MLB, which ESPN buried over a decade ago – are doing fine ratings-wise. Nobody under the age of 40 or so watches the NBA, a lot follow it like a soap opera, but the amount of people who actually care about the NBA day-to-day is vanishingly small. It’s like a situation where the NBA is relevant because the media (ESPN, TNT, etc.) says it is relevant. This is totally detached from reality, and I suspect it is highly ideological and the NBA is valued highly by the powers-that-be because it is effective social engineering. If I told this to 2015 me, I would have said that 2025 me is totally insane, but everything else is fake in our society, so why wouldn’t this? I wouldn’t even be surprised if USAID was funneling money to the NBA and its “partners” in support of its narrative.

        ‘Of course, the new owners do not care about the business side. They are billionaires who want to be in the billionaire club’Right.  Most sports-club ownerships are vanity purchases.  Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys is a good example.  Loves the limelight, teevee interviews, likes to hear the sound of his own voice.  It’s a way to say, ‘Everybody lookit me!  I’m rich ‘n powerful!’Forty years ago, the NBA was extremely popular, because America was a society of men, including young men with athletic backgrounds like me, who related directly to sports teams and programming.  Just as important, there was NO ideo-political aspect to broadcast sports.Now, sports is inundated with Woke messaging, including the hilarious sight of mega-millionaire players running around with ‘Equality’ and ‘Stop Racism’ on the back of their jerseys.  Those young male fans of yore now are old, and living in a society that despises men, boys, masculinity, excellence and merit.  Viewership predictably tanks.

                Ain’t that the truth.  I turn off the sound, usually, with female sports announcers.  It’s a man’s domain, should remain a man’s domain, and women’s place in it should be cheerleading.

                    I more or less agree, but because women do a horse-shit job of reporting sports. If they did as good a job, I’m not sure I’d care. Though I pay no attention to sports in the first place, and couldn’t tell you who was doing a good job at it…

            I dunno. If you’re able to make a billion by creating a better mousetrap, good on you. In theory anyway. But in our system, it seems as if possibly even the majority of billionaires never turned a profit in the traditional sense. Particularly odious are ones such as Susan Wojcicki (who’s been in the news lately) who became one by founding a company that has done nothing but lose money and is now bankrupt. Or was it just alimony from her ex husband. Speaking of which, there is a prominent, if not exactly new, distinct class of female baizuo billionaire who got it from her ex husband and then plows gobs of it into every degenerate leftist homo cause she can find in a directory. Lauren Jobs, Mackenzie Bezos come to mind. I can’t call it new, Ray Kroc’s wife Joan did something similar for NPR back in the day.

                that’s the thing; it doesn’t come from building a better mousetrap.  It’s made by “financialization” which I don’t understand at all.  Again, i may be stupid, but i don’t understand it.  Also, a lot of it is made by alignment with deep state/CIA.
In a perfect world, yeah Joe Shmo should have a billion bucks because he made something really useful.  But should Ramaswamy have a billion?  Should there be people worth 50, 100, 200 billion?  A trillion?  Do they create that value?  Are they a million times better and more useful than a really good plumber?

                A rare (and interesting) example of a self made “legitimate” female billionaire is JK Rowling.   But then of course she (a) famously became a non-billionaire by giving so much of it away, and (b) infamously was Hurled Into The Void (™Z) for rejecting the trannies, thus becoming as bad as Trump, and accordingly Hitler?  Or maybe just Eva Braun?  It’s so hard to keep up….

        I’ve only ever watched one NBA game in my life.  A guy I worked with told me he had courtside tickets to a Denver Nuggets game and asked if I wanted to go.  This was in 1999.  I remember being shocked because he didn’t seem like a sportsball fan, and had a reputation of being a PITA grouch.  So I went because why not, try new things, make a friend, and the seats were indeed court sided…my feet were on the court.  Next to the cheerleaders.About halfway into the game I noticed one of the cheerleaders had a knee brace, and she wasn’t going out to dance.  I have a type, most men do, and she was it.  Petite, brunette, fit.  My host shrugged, noting how cute she was, but said something like “She has no interest in us, so why care?” I decided to quietly step over and say hello since she was only about 10 feet away.  Sat down on the floor, introduced myself, asked about her knee, and if she was doing alright.  We talked for about a minute or two before the intermission ended.  Got her number and we went out a couple times.  Paralegal.  Nice girl.  Can’t for the life of me remember her name.What were we talking about again?

        The big change in sports team valuations has been the leagues’ permitting private equity funds (as opposed to private equity moguls as individuals) to invest in teams. This has driven valuations to unprecedented heights as new pools of owners/money are tapped. It’s also worth noting that the NBA draws global interest. Foreigners don’t understand or like American football, hockey and baseball have limited appeal, but many like/follow basketball. When I was in Asia and Japan a few years back, I was astonished how knowledgeable the kids there were about the NBA. All that said, the prices now seem stupid to me as a financial person, but I said that 5 years ago too.

            All four sports leagues have tight limits on private equity. The Celtics case is the test as it will have majority PE. Up until now the cap was around ten percent, so PE has not played a role until maybe now. Odds are, the Celtics deal gets restructured to conform to the rules on PE ownership.

                Private equity keeps trying to buy their way into college football, but the Big Ten and the SEC have no interest. (The Big Ten has decided to hear proposals, however.)One of the reasons I support my alma mater’s teams is because when I pay $11 for a Diet Coke at the stadium, at least I’m helping the school. My money isn’t going into some bankster’s pocket.If it ever gets to the point where we have the KKR Alabama Crimson Tide, the Bain Capital Michigan Wolverines (after all, the Mitt Romney is from Michigan) and the Black Rock Ohio State Buckeyes, I’m out.

                        First, if you’re lucky enough to be a fan of a big university, you’re getting network quality programming, but I get what you’re saying about the shoddy production value. But the new paradigm seems to be about gambling. I’m sure they’ll figure out ways to gamble on all kinds of things like pole vaulting and all kinds of revenue streams will come raining down on the banksters.

                            The gambling angle has a limit too, as that industry discovered when the Injun casinos began proliferating everywhere. There are only so many people who are willing to gamble, and only so much they are willing to bet. Putting aside the aspect of scandal, which I am sure has already been suppressed.

                        “I struggle to maintain interest in college football.”That’s because you’ve not had the benefit of a close and inside look as I’ve had after 30+ years inside a major university.  You’d have no problem writing off college football support.Some highlights of wife and I:—Tutoring players who could not write their name on an essay paper.  They could not even write a coherent sentence as well.  Were talking work at the third grade level at best!—Being told by Athletic Department staff to never be alone with players you are assigned to tutor due to personal danger (wife/rape/etc).—Pressure to pass players in class that never even showed up for lecture or tests.—Faculty caught yielding to above pressure from Athletic Department and investigated by faculty governance committee.  For example, this faculty member would pass all athletes in his class—he taught *Russian* language!  Hell, these athletes could not speak English.—Scandals examined at the faculty/legislature level involving 90% plus basketball team members not graduating.—Coach involved in the above was a superstar so the local newspaper fired the reporters instead when coach threatened to leave university.  There is now a bronze statue of the coach in front of the stadium.  😉—On again and off again mandatory fees levied on student tuition to support the athletic department.  Now on again as the revenue has been drying up for Athletic Department.—Repeated thuggishness scandals of players arrested for violence including sexual assault.  This is a regular occurrence.I see no reason to support such from any decent person.

                Right. But the valuations ran up in anticipation of the private equity ownership rules changing/getting more flexible. Everyone here in NYC has been talking about this since Covid.One other key thing I should point out is that many team owners are buying up real estate around the stadia/arenas and making money on ancillary businesses and RE development. The Red Sox owners did this very effectively. The Las Vegas deals revolved around RE redevelopment.

                    Not buying up real estate around the area was Walt Disney’s mistake when he made Disneyland. He created this big attraction, but saw all the real profits go to those who owned hotels and motels in the outlying areas. So when he built a new park in Orlando, he knew he needed land big enough for not just the attractions but also hotels.

        For us locally, you can see the next move. Fanduel has bought out the local sports station. Used to be PASS, then FoxSports, then Bally, now Fanduel. They are going to start restricting certain sport events to pay per view. You kinda see that with Amazon and Thursday nite football. The future will be, “Oh boy! Classic match up! Packers-vs-Bears!

            That is the death spiral boxing followed. My bet is college sports die first then arena sports like hockey and basketball. Baseball, strangely enough, is the most financially stable sport because it relies on the live gate and it controls its development system. It remains very old fashioned.

                If you know anything about the business of college sports, and I don’t claim to be an expert but I do know more than the average person, it functions basically as their marketing department. Keeps alums connected to the university which results in donations and endowment money, creates halo marketing for the university to reach out to the general public. Without sports, a university is just a glorified office park.(That is in addition to the other things that it purports to do when it comes to the advancement of education.)My high school keeps sending me stuff for their annual alumni dinner. I have absolutely no interest in attending. I do at least have a passing interest in my local university and I think a big part of it is because of the halo marketing from their sports teams. It keeps them in the public eye. It’s like naming rights on a stadium. Who would have even heard of Paycor if they didn’t have their name on what used to be Paul Brown Stadium?So, I don’t see university sports going away. I see maybe the top 40 or so football programs separating themselves from the rest, which isn’t necessarily going to be a bad thing.

                            Our stadium is recessed in a giant pit. It included footings for another stadium on top. We’ve discussed adding another 60-100k seats, which could bring the total to 200k+, although nobody can answer the why question. We’re televised,and this would cut into live attendance presumably. Ann Arbor is pretty crazy on game day as it is. But if demand is there, I could see expansion beyond 200k.

                    There is at least one exception to your rule (so perhaps it can be done), the University of Chicago.  They once had sports, then eliminated them.  Their reputation has not suffered as they are well known among elite universities.

                        Well, they still have sports, just not big time sports. My cousin’s kid played on the basketball team there. I also read something about how there was resentment on the West Coast back in the 1940s or 1950s because USC was seen as new money. They were riding their sports success and were an academic wannabe. Of course, the academic blue bloods turned their nose up at that.
Of course, it worked for USC. It’s a very good institution and hard to get into. I don’t know where they rank in terms of research or anything like that though.

                            You are correct—Div III.  I should have made myself more clear, but the emphasis of the NCAA is gone.  I have no problem with true amateur sports without the scholarship and alumni nonsense.  This is why, at the end, I only watched women’s sports at my old university.  They seemed to be having fun.

                I’ve always admired the PGA [golf] and the ATP [tennis].Those Bros are smart fellows, they all have strong business sense, and they have no desire whatsoever to be Hymen Shekelstein’s pet goy.They’re individualists who own themselves.I guess the fellows in the NFL &amp; the NBA just didn’t have the gray matter necessary to make the transition from wagie to owner.https://urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wagie/pol/ has been doing yeomen’s work in trying to ridicule the poor wage slaves [who will hopefully suffer enough from the humiliation of it that eventually they will see the light and stop being wage slaves].Frankly, it dawns on me that there could be an 80/20 Pareto Distribution here: Maybe 80% of professional team-sports athletes are simply to stupid to be their own bosses, and only 20% ofprofessional team-sports athletes have the IQ necessary to be freelancers.Look at Roger Staubach as an example; after he retired from the Cowboys, he created a billion dollar real estate practice in Texas, then he worked another decade after that, with an UK firm, called, “Jones Lang LaSalle“.PS: I have heard [and it might have been here at ZMan] that Staubach was a dirty dealing underhanded fellow in the Texas Real Estate market.

            I’m old enough to remember when the Chicago White Sox went on pay-per-view with SportsVision in the early 1980s and lost a ton of cash on it, while the Chicago Cubs went with WGN (and stole Harry Carey from the White Sox) while expanding their reach and fan base with WGN being a “Super Station” added to multiple cable networks. Pretty much tilted the local coverage to The Loveable Losers permanently. Wrigley became THE place to be.I’m struggling to understand how many people are going to pony up cash to watch a game you used to be able to see free on TV, or at least was bundled with the rest of the cable you paid for. As Z said, that’s the path boxing followed and I don’t even know WHO the Heavyweight Champion of the World is these days, if there is one.A far cry from when Ali, Frazier, and Foreman were on Wide World of Sports.But I guess if you’re making sure your team beats the spread . . . . 🤑

            pay per view is a dead model.    I’m an avid MMA watcher (UFC).   let’s just say there are ways to watch PPV’s without having to pay the devil mouse (who owns the PPV broadcast rights).   Most other nations don’t even do the PPV.

        The administration talks the same way about the global economy. The feeling is that the world is freeloading off of our defense umbrella, the dollar as the global reserve currency and access to our market. Trump is trying to dismantle that system.
In particular, the administration understands the toll that being the reserve currency takes on the US and the benefit that the world gets from being able to use the dollar. (Yes, we get benefits too, but we also get costs.)

            The real driver of the global economy is the eurodollar system.  There are more dollars outside the US than in.
What the demand is for, is forsafetyandliquidity, of the settlements.That is, the settlements between the banks and nonbanks themselves.
This is why the eurodollar has gone from $1 trillion in 1980 to $36 trillion in 2025, because both banks and nonbanks (hedge funds, equity funds, traders) don’t pay much or any attention to inflation, consumer prices, or the normal “real world” economy.

        I think the fever of taxpayers being bled white to support playgrounds for billionaires while our civilization-sustaining infrastructure such as water mains, bridges, streets and sewers crumble is starting to break.The Tampa Bay Rays had a billion-dollar stadium deal, but their hedge fund owner bailed because he couldn’t pay for his end of the deal and now the team will play in the Yankees’ spring training park.Same for the Athletics, who are now in Sacramento playing in a minor league ballpark with NO bathrooms attached to the dugouts and holding news conferences for the sports “reporters” in a storage building. The Nevada Legislature is balking at building a park for this woe-be-gone team that has sucked for decades.Baseball sucks. One team owned by a hedge fund, the Dodgers, now has a billion-dollar payroll, but it’s in “deferred” contracts so they aren’t subject to MLB’s luxury “tax.” The league is now a few coastal teams with billionaires seeking to win titles by writing checks while the rest of the also-rans function as a developmental league (imagine a minor league level above Class AAA) for the big clubs. These teams have no hope and their ownership can’t afford to compete.The MLB suits expanded the playoffs in a manner that penalizes division winners, who have a long layoff between the end of the regular season during their wild-card bye. The stats dorks have made the game into either home runs or strikeouts at the plate, as the art of hitting line drives through a gap is dead. You can’t be a pitcher that doesn’t throw at least 95 mph now and all of these kids are blowing out their pitching elbows as a result.The Pittsburg Pirates have the best pitcher in the league for the next four years, but he’ll leave for a $100 billion contract with the team that can afford to buy players, leaving the Bucs high and dry in their beautiful park.In the NFL, no one in Ohio wants to foot the bill for a new Cleveland playground for Captain Happy Ending, DeShaun Watson, a reprobate who likes to whip out his willy for massage therapists.The NBA is unwatchable dreck. The stats nerds say you either need a dunk or a 3-pointer and any mid-range shot is a waste, so that’s where hoops is. Add to the fact that these 80-IQ (at best) players are awful, tattoo-covered degenerates who’ve been told they’re God’s gift to hoops and you have a recipe for disaster.Former Chicago Cubs’ manager Lee Elia lobbed a 16-inch shell at the idiocy of sportsball fans in his epic 1983 rant that has to be heard to be believedThey’re really, really behind you around here… my&amp;%#$in’ ass. What the&amp;%#$am I supposed to do, go out there and let my&amp;%#$n’ players get destroyed every day and be quiet about it? For the&amp;%#$in’ nickel-dime people who turn up?The mother&amp;%#$ers don’t even work. That’s why they’re out at the fuckin’ game. They oughta go out and get a&amp;%#$in’ job and find out what it’s like to go out and earn a&amp;%#$in’ living. Eighty-five percent of the&amp;%#$in’ world is working. The other fifteen percent come out here. A&amp;%#$in’ playground for the cocksuckers.Rip them mother&amp;%#$ers. Rip them fuckin’ cocksuckers like the&amp;%#$in’ players. we got guys bustin’ their&amp;%#$in’ ass, and them&amp;%#$in’ people boo. And that’s the Cubs?

Really put a hole in the “Bleacher Bum” myth of the Cubs fans.“because if they’re the real Chicago f-ckin’ fans, they can kiss my f-ckin’ ass right downtown and PRINT IT.”2)The league is now a few coastal teams with billionaires seeking to win titles by writing checks while the rest of the also-rans function as a developmental league (imagine a minor league level above Class AAA) for the big clubs. These teams have no hope and their ownership can’t afford to compete.That is so perilously close to the situation in IndyCar today I don’t know if I should laugh or cry.

                Why would anyone want to watch a sport where a few bluebloods dominate everything (or in the case of IndyCar, a few well-financed teams)?
Look at the NCAA Tournament. There used to be upsets galore, especially on that glorious first couple of days with wall-to-wall hoops. Now, the bigger schools can buy players and any player that has talent will jump ship to the bigger bag.
It’s little wonder that all four No. 1 seeds advanced to the Final Four.

A’s hire investment firm to secure additional $500M for Vegas stadium: report
Absolutely NOBODY – in Vegas or Oakland – wants this relocation to happen, but the owner. $380 million in Vegas taxpayer dollars already pledged for the new $1.5 billion stadium, but they’re struggling to meet the $500 million shortfall with private investment:

            Similar thing happening now in AZ with the baseball team, the Diamondbacks, threatening to leave if yet another new stadium is not built for their owners benefit—to be paid for by taxpayer levy as was the first 25 years ago.Here’s a good summary from an old analyst/detractor of sportsball summary, Andrew Zimbalist.From ChatGPT:Andrew Zimbalist, a well-known sports economist and professor at Smith College. He’s one of the most prominent voices critical of public subsidies for professional sports stadiums and teams.Key Findings from Zimbalist’s Work:• Negative Return for Taxpayers: Zimbalist has consistently argued that public funding for sports stadiums rarely delivers the promised economic benefits. While proponents often claim new teams or stadiums will boost local economies, his research shows that these projects tend to divert spending from other local entertainment rather than generating new economic activity.• Job Creation Is Overstated: He found that while stadium projects create construction jobs temporarily, the long-term employment benefits are minimal, and the jobs created are often low-wage or seasonal.• Subsidies Enrich Owners: The biggest beneficiaries of public investments in sports are typically team owners and wealthy developers, not local residents.• Opportunity Cost: Public money spent on stadiums could be more productively used elsewhere—like schools, infrastructure, or public health—where the returns are much higher.Zimbalist has written several books on the topic, including “Sports, Jobs, and Taxes” (co-edited with Roger G. Noll) and “Circus Maximus: The Economic Gamble Behind Hosting the Olympics and the World Cup.” His work has been widely cited in debates about stadium funding and sports policy across the U.S.

                I think it depends on the city. Phoenix has enough going for it that a baseball team isn’t going to make much of a difference one way or another. Besides, baseball is in decline.If you’re a Cincinnati, it’s a different story. Cincinnati is a fine place, but without pro sports, they will never be able to generate any kind of buzz for themselves. Cincinnati is a fine Metro area, but nobody will ever hear about it or even think about it if it doesn’t have any kind of pro team.It really does help marketing efforts. And I don’t think people have done a good job quantifying it.Now, I am an agreement with what you say as well, but that’s the market we’re in. Unless all cities stop throwing incentive the teams, you have to play the incentives game to keep up. And the federal government will never put a stop to this because you know who owns a good number of (((sports franchises))) and they control the government.

                    You fail to read or acknowledge the points made in my comment from long standing research in the area of economic benefit.  You’ve stated an opinion, fine.  The publications from Zimbalist are backed up by years of study and research. Your arguments are precisely the ones made by every political entity in these communities, but never supported by analysis after the deed is done.Pol’s love to spend taxpayer money with all sorts of made up benefits as excuses.  The fact of the matter is that all these communities are taxed to construct a stadium primarily for sportsball owners’ benefit, while that money could be spent elsewhere on more productive endeavors that benefit more than a small segment of the community.

                        I’ve seen those studies for years. I used to even be on your side on this issue. But when you’ve been on this Earth for a while, you start to realize that some things just are the way they are. I don’t see any cities going bankrupt because they’re building stadiums. I also don’t see any cities falling behind because they put their money into a stadium instead of, say, daycare.

                            Problem is no city is putting that money where it makes a positive difference — growing the business sector. The closest you can get is TIF and boondoggles for the politically connected.If you look under the hood, that’s what’s in common with all the entities who are pledging capital investment in the US under the Trump tariffs. Sure they will cram a bunch of money in fast to get the early profits, but when that starts to wane, they will remove the equipment and leave the relatively cheap building to collapse into decrepitude.It’s the story of all government subsidized development, of any kind. The vultures come in and grab all the easy money, and communities are left to deal with the consequences.

                    I knew a young, very rich lad (bought out by Halliburton in the Northwest Territories, Canada) who found an undiscovered, sealed-up basement speakeasy in Cincinatti. With all the original accoutrements intact, covered in dust. It had sat there since the end of Prohibition.
Since my formative years were working in a small, legendary casino, along with other experience, good heavens what I would’ve done with that place.It could’ve become a Name…but no, he’s a typical American capitalist, so there it sits still.

        This may not be worth anything, but CNBC has an estimated value of every NBA team.  This would give the total a market cap of $1.4 trillion while TV revenue, their major source of income is $76 billion and divided among the teams. I would assume Boomers are holding up the cable TV and eventually that business model will also go through an upheaval.If any of the data in the CNBC graph is accurate,  a few teams have more debt than revenue which would normally be a red flag to investors and financial partners. The problem with evaluating this is that all the data around these leagues is bogus, in addition to the financials, TV viewers, ticket sales, attendance all have to be fake.  What happens if owning one of these teams suddenly falls out of favor with elites?https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/14/cnbcs-official-nba-team-valuations-2025.html

        “The reason Trump is tryingto usher in a new economic model is that the old one, the financialized economy, is running out of places to hide the costs of endless credit creation and the auctioning off of social capital.”Not so fast. In the USA there are still many powerful people who are devoted to dark projects like breaking up and plundering Russia, conquering (or destroying) China, establishing worldwide unipolar democracy, and making Jerusalem into the capital of the world. They have at least five major problems however if the USA is to be the primary tool for accomplishing their goals.– the horrid financial condition of the US gov– mediocre industrial capacity– domestic antizionism and suspicion toward Jews– the weaking faith of “white” men in the empire of Usury, Sensuality, and Avarice– social cancers like the transgenderism delusion.It’s obvious that the Democrats and most Republicucks aren’t up to the task of solving these problems. Therefore Donald J. Trump. His mission, which he likely doesn’t understand, is to prepare the empire for her next world war. This is the reason for taming the oldsocialmodel and its financialized society. It’s merely a means to bad ends.DOGE and other costcutting efforts are expected to solve the financial problem. Tariffs are for restoring industry. There’s a crackdown on pro-Palestinian activists and so-called “anti-Semitism”, even at Kennedy’s DHHS. The war on DIE and a big military parade being planned for June are parts of a PR campaign to win whitetarded boys and men back to the military and slavish subservience to the imperial capital. And the Trump admin is suppressing transgenderism in the military and elsewhere as opportunities arise.Check your conservatism and Trump Euphoria Syndrome. You’ve fallen for a major political hustle.

            It is true likely what you say in terms of the motivation. However, rather than being fully cynical and thinking the masters of this mess are all powerful, there is another perspective.In Trump, at least the reforms provide an opportunity for castle building and bolstering our position. The Harris marionette provided no such opportunities. It was instant death and then the Mass White Sacrifice.In the types of reforms Trump is doing are many cracks and opportunities for the American Alerics to position themselves. They just have to be more reliable and competent partners than the DIE brigades. This regime has a lot of tigers by the tail and entropy working against them. Slip into some cracks and build strength for when better opportunities arrive – which they surely will.

                That’s just wishful thinking.Heelsup Harris was the better opportunity. The victors would have overreacted by immediately intensifying their long war to destroy us, and this would have pushed tens of millions very quickly in the direction ofapostasy.A window of opportunity would have opened to persude those millions that the USA was born bad and can’t become otherwise, because she originated among cryptozionists, idiots, revolutionary sophists, and scam artists. Meanwhile the financial and industrial conditions would have continued to deteriorate. Cracks would be forming and widening into canyons in which to organize replacment systems for our own people. It wouldn’t have been long before globalist “white” cops would be drawing fire from gun nuts who have just posted videos of burning their US flags.AH‘s empire would be staggering toward complete disintegration.As things stand now, millions of zombies are becoming enthusiastic to make a new American century, i.e. a safe space for globalisms wrapped in Old Glory. The Boomer president is saving the globalists from their unforced errors, and motive for what you desire is being drained away in favor of a great, premediated world war.

Sad, isn’t it? Israel’smendacious propaganda about being foreigners in Egypthas been a great inspiration for Israel and others when devising tactics to cripple suckers with tears for the other. Possibly Charlemagne, too, fell for it. It’s baked into his religion, too, of course. If so, this could explain his willingness to allow termites to migrate into his realm from the Mediterranean region. A reward granted for that traitor’s services (which included great massacres) has been a smear about him being “anti-Semitic”, as if that were a bad disposition to have.

                    4 years of Harris would have meant another 20 million (at least) wogs imported. That would have been The End. Wouldn’t have mattered what kind of backlash she inspired, because it couldn’t have overcome the math. Maybe it already can’t. But perhaps there’s still some hope for meaningful deportations. The jew york post said a week or so ago that Trump admin deportations were north of 100,000, not where it needs to be but not bad for the first two months. And more than people thought.

                    Maybe. It sounds more like a recipe for total, mass demoralization leading to a final capitulation. Then another 20, 30, 40 million invaders being resettled and it is hard to see how you can use that as a springboard for turning things around.
What you describe sounds like a rout. I don’t know of any military strategy where welcoming a rout turns the battle in your favor.

                        About 250 yrs ago, other reason makers were crying in pain about “Oppressions” such the king stirring up “merciless Indian Savages”. We are led to believe by their agitprop that the mIS were poised to overrun the empire’s colonies along the Atlantic coast.
And now I’m reminded of the utility of planting DJT in the WH for the 250th anniversary of the partition. You fell for that ploy, too.

        Private equity is vacuuming up everything, especially housing. There are plenty of ads on the TV (and mail offers) with some guy offering to buy your home for cash on an expedited basis. I have always suspected that these guys are fronting for some private equity business. They see a world where they own everything, you own nothing but you will be happy.

            I don’t worry about those things very much. If there really are even a million late Millennial, GenZ and early GenA who want an affordable future, all they have to do is be willing to pick up a hammer, a pipe wrench, a sheet metal brake, a wirestripper and linemans pliers, heck, anything trades related, and there would be enough housing to drop the bottom out of the market.The simple fact is that there simply are not that many who are willing to do that. Being a keyboard warrior is about their highest aspiration. And if Congress doesn’t get off its butt and renew (or make permanent) the tax cut, the ones who did will get hit with a 40%(!) sole-proprietor/partnership tax rate. And, yet, even here, people whine about Republican’ts who insist on tax cuts in exchange for their votes on other bills.No one truly gives a flying fuck about the next generation’s entrepreneurs.Hence, we will fail.

                Is this before or after the people with more money than God show up to distort the local economy, or in this case the economies of many locales at once? This, and this alone, is why people like me cannot wait for people like you, your ways, and their memory to fade from the world. Not because you got yours, but because you will eventually backtrack on every one of your own holy dogmas when explanations for why others haven’t got theirs that you find comforting have been exhausted. In this thread alone you’ve swung from smugly asking which aspects of human nature capitalism fails to account for, to naming perhaps its most salient failure, and back to “I don’t care, I got mine, y’all are just lazy keyboard warrior antifa.”Young, mostly white men put in longer average hours than you could credibly claim to have ever done performing grueling, necessary, dangerous jobs you take for granted, without which the system you cannot bear to admit you worship cannot function, for wages that depreciate from competitive to inadequate in under a year. I have seen some of them murdered by things that are barely human for their trouble. And yet you have the temerity to mock them, because I suppose if they had just been eNTRePReNeuRS like you (which you seem to have missed became synonymous with ‘con man’ at least a decade ago) they’d have got theirs too, right? Frankly, I consider those who murder them to be your moral superiors. They will at least be deserving of the effort required to take from them by force what old age will, by the Grace of Almighty God, take from you by default. There’s no shortage of contemptible old fools in this place, but you might be the most odious.Cue the litany of schoolyard insults and boasts you people unaccountably believe ever held some kind of sting for any but the most unstable lunatic reds; they aren’t the only people, or even the foremost, taking note of who says what in the clear.

        I’m sure somebody said it was a sign of the end times back when Babe Ruth signed a contract for $70,000 a year. I felt something similar when Apple’s market cap topped $1 trillion. Next thing you knew it was $2 trillion.But the strategically targeted inflation, aka financialization, has pretty much run its course. We know this because of the new tariff regime. If it was still working, that wouldn’t be happening. Unfortunately, that doesn’t necessarily mean inflation has ended, but it could mean that the regime’s ability to direct and target it towards certain assets has. This economy could use some good old fashioned deflation IYAM.

            The next phase of looting will be directing the inflation to come crashing back onshore by selling off even more of the nation.The entire model is still one of massive amounts of capital financing some venture.The 16th – early 20th century was done on the backs of low capital inventors in garages. It took large amounts of capital to produce those goods. I wonder if there is some path to invention/innovation that produces more capital than it consumes and requires much less capital to seed it.Supposedly that was software, but it didn’t really work that way. As always you make an excellent point today.

        The NBA is financed, in large part, by taxes it levies on every household.It is that we cannot continue to socialize the costs of creating more credit money. Just as critically, we can no longer tolerate an oligarchy built on privatizing the profits of this system.DOGE really flushed to the surface the degree to which the luxury waste is subsidized by the least among us. The tariff contretemps exposed the utter disdain the ruling class and its agents and whores have for the host of these parasites. I don’t know what all will change as a result of that public knowledge although some things at a minimum will, but it is idiotic to pretend like the last two months have not been revolutionary.

            What’s left?
Commodities. Private equity holds in mining and manufacturing. Sea as well as air drone manufacturing. Nuke plants and operators. Air taxi operators and infrastructure.
There are many opportunities. Wish I had the stomach for Bitcoin. My nephew went all in for years when it was under $10. He’s comfortably retired with a diversified portfolio at the ripe ol’ age of 35. Spends his time raising two white sons outside of Boston, the wife still works so she doesn’t have to answer to him. Not a good sign methinks.

Holy Moly.  The rent/buy proposition on females is getting lopsidedly biased toward ‘rent’.  I haven’t always been fully satisfied with living like a monk, but stories like that make me content with it.
Thanks for the ideas.

IMO, silver is still being suppressed for some reason. But don’t think of it as market manipulation. Think of it as a subsidy for buying silver.

        This article cogently &amp; concisely explains the asset bubble economy that we have been living thru for many years. If it’s over now, then big changes are in stare for us.I have always wondered about these so-called “asset managers”. Why are there so many of them? How do they get their billions? How do they “create” wealth? I think they usefinancial legerdemainto steal it and to destroy our social capital. And massive tax breaks. All perfectly legal, of course.Trump’s tariffs caused me some grief, when he first declared them, even before he took office. Too radical. Too extreme. It would cause an economic depression, which would give Congress back to the Democrats in 2026 and the presidency in 2028. Then it would be GAME OVER for America. Now I am not so sure. Maybe there’s a silver lining in this dark cloud. I hope so.

            “Ihave always wondered about these so-called “asset managers”. Why are there so many of them? How do they get their billions? How do they “create” wealth?”I run my business on a different fiscal year, largely to avoid the end of year fluctuations that always result from wash sales.But every stinking year at this point in April, I get really cranky when I look at my consolidated statements and reflect that because of the f-ing government, I have to have “managers” fill out paperwork for the f-ing goverment, and they always, ALWAYS underperform my internet trading account.I swear, get the stinking government out of money and finance and a slew of our problems go away.

        i can tell Zman hasn’t cut the cord yet.  i don’t have a cable tv subscription so i don’t subsidize sports and all the crappy bundled channels.  neither do other folks who get content through streaming.  there has been a steady erosion of revenue to espn and other sports dependent businesses.
boxing used to be the biggest sport in the US back in the 30s and 40s, but it is pretty marginalized now.  the negroazation of that sport lead to its decline, same as the nba.  just like any public place where nigs are prevalent.

        I don’t know about how PE will rip a profit from their models — probably from gambling — just another grift to extract social capital from the natural fan base: white men. It likely will mean a steady decline in public interest despite extracting enough profits to make it work. It’s the gambling that bothers me. And the negroes.

        It is easier to make fun of a money-based economy, which functions as an adjunct to the banks, than to analyze it dispassionately. From a financial rewards sense, it is immensely more lucrative to own a major node of the global financial system like the modern London stock exchange than it would have been to own 100 cotton-processing plants in a Midlands port town. Money is the lubricant that makes economies go. If you devalue it through debasing the coinage (in olden times) or constipating the process by tight credit (today) you harm businesses across the board, not just expanding ones. That noise you hear alongside the cash register, sounding so much like the chimes of doom, is the grim reaper pressing his hand down hard on the scales of the finance system.

            Poetic writing does not make up for substance, but nice try.  The problem is not how much money you make, but in how you make it.  Symbol manipulators do not add as much to the economy as you propose.  Many of the billionaires we have today are in that class.  Debasing money is a fact not in evidence here.

            “even I thinkthat cash would be better spent teaching kids in Baltimore how to read”Do you know who those keeyids are?A thousand downvotes to your comical foolishness, Marko. The correct amount for teaching those bad demons to read is $0/yr.Zero per year, every year. Same as the correct amount for subsidizing their reproduction.First you teach those narcissistic beasts to read. Soon they can control city governments for the globalists. Demagogues arise among them to demand vast amounts of loot (the MLK Jr plan) because social justice. They want and get a “Congressional Black Caucus” (founded 1971) even though everyone can see that they have brown skin.Eventually they whose blackness is within are pouring out hypocritical sludge about “antiracism” and “white privilege” in a campaign to demoralize and enslave us. All along the way some Shemites are rubbing their hands together with glee about the progress.Good grief, wake up.

            Players are underpaid compared to management, nominal owners, etc. Of course some of them are overpaid, because player contracts are wagers, but overall, and especially in the case of “stars,” they’re getting ripped off. Michael Jordan is the most underpaid employee in world history.Scarcity = price, approximately, says the Law. A position only a dozen men canpossiblyfill will pay far more than, say, CEO of PepsiCo, which at the very least many millions of us would do no worse than whatever moron is doing it now. (You don’t know who that is because it doesn’t matter who it is.) However, the economy is fake. Economics is whichever set of lies about ititpresently finds useful. (How else would progress in the field be possible? Can a Law change?)A rich idiot offends our white-people sense that the market should be functional, that merit will out, that deals are reciprocal, that lies should only be used in emergencies, etc.—in sum, that the best man wins, or at least a pretty good guy. NBA stars are so retarded and indecent (few exceptions), we can’t pretend they’re good men. We displace our true complaint—that the system is rigged against almost everybody,including them—onto them, because they’re assholes.Why do we know exactly how much each of them is paid? Why is that theleague’s own newsabout them? “Entertainment product.” That’s the show.
