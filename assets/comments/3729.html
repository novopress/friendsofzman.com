        “The simplicity of Soviet weapons surprises everyone. But each type of equipment which is produced is turned out in two variants-the normal one and the `monkey-model’.”
fromhttp://militera.lib.ru/research/suvorov12/06.html
The Russians like simple, uncomplicated designs. Perhaps they have a thorough understanding of their users.

        if “Travel challenges your assumptions..”  relocating to diverse areas for extended time changes your assumptions.  Born and raised in New England, transplanted to the Mid Atlantic, relocated to Miami ( can’t really explain Miami, you have to be there), then to the Deep South and finally the Gulf of Mexico, I can tell you my understandings have changed constantly.  The smugness of my northeastern upbringing finally erased, allowed me to appreciate other areas for what they really are, not some misplaced notions derived from afar. Some time ago I read an article that said 90% of the world’s population never travels more than 15 miles from where they were born.  So much for challenging assumptions of the masses.

            Certain parts of America are strangely provincial. New England is one of them. I love the place and called it home for a long time, but it is a giant hamlet in many ways. Miami is a city without a place. I agree that you have to be there to understand it. It is one of the strangest towns I’ve experienced.

        “..Socialism works only where you have enough smart people around to make it work, despite the infinite number of internal contradictions”I am reminded of my visit to the People’s Palace in Bucharest, that monstrosity erected to satisfy the vanity of Ceaucescu.   The regime was supported by legions of well trained engineers, architects and what not.  All of them competent enough in their own way up to the limit of exposing themselves to responsibility.  Thus you get an Opera house built into the centre of this massive office building – all complete except somehow the architects neglected to include wings or a backstage.  When this was realized, the smarter ones dropped tools and fled the country with their families before the inevitable finger pointing ended in lonely machine gunnings beside a mass grave.Socialism has no sense of humour.

            After the fall of the Soviets, there was a period when western military people got to work with their Russian counterparts to make sure the Soviet nukes did not wander off too far. The West was horrified by what they learned. On the one hand, it is a miracle that the Soviets did not accidentally nuke the world. On the other hand, their incompetence was such that it seemed to counter that incompetence.
