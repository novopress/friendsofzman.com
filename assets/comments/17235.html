        Those in the vanguard of moral madness today are predominantly scions of broken families. WEIRD family structues have degenerated from extended families to nuclear to atomized individuals “hooking up.”  This has broken the normal transmission of parenting skills from parents to children and set up  a huge negative feedback loop at the core of our society.The craziest SJW’s I’ve known seem driven by adolescent angst and revenge against their own upbringing. Like locusts rubbing wings, these malcontents radicalize each other and draw those less damaged into their madness by social pressure.  Crazy people who can LARP as functional tend to socially signal like “strong horse” leaders. The castrating bitch SJW who was triggered by her mom’s serial boyfriends creeping on her draws in the quiet, nerdy girl who just doesn’t fit in, and pretty soon the feedback loop produces an army of variously damaged misfits welded together by the desire to Burn It All Down.The public school system makes us warehouse our children with these nihilists. I recommend John Taylor Gatto’s “Weapons of Mass Instruction” for some insights into how the schools act as “hot zones” for psychological contagion.  He praises the Amish for resisting compulsory schooling not so much for religious reasons but rather for removing children from their homes and families and subjecting them to indoctrination among strangers bad &amp; mad.

            Well said.  The Babe too.However its not easy to control hypergamy in a wealthy urban society with a lot of boots on necks and that may not even work. Iran is a literal theocracy and it has a 1.5 TFR and rampant decay and Saudi Arabia where women have mostly zip rights and custom to enforce  it  is just a bit  above replacement, maybe.A society (US White here) with a total fertility rate of 1.6-1.8  and like half  of them, illegitimate or  divorce victims can’t be healthy . This is a real  healthy TFR of like 1.0 and that’s being generousFixing it would require a dictatorial effort to do , essentially reforming everything around intact family formation and job stability. It could be done but Americans are highly individualistic and there are a lot on the so called Right who would gladly turn into terrorists over Federal marriage reformAnd yes it does have to be Federal . Since the custom was broken by easy divorce and gay marriage  there has to be one new custom enforced from above xxtap

                Most people think religion exists to provide a common morality but they’re wrong. Humans and animals have a morality independent of religion which can be seen in studies of babies and altruistic behavior in wild animals (to other species even).Religion is social technology. It exists simply because those who are religious out-reproduce those who are not over time. If you remove the parts of it that promote fertility it’s no longer a religion, just an ideology that has to recruit new members at or above replacement levels or die out.Most of the world thought Christianity was a dead religion around WW2. New “religions” were introduced like Humanitarianism, Environmentalism, and Martin Luther Kingism yet they all lack the aspect that encourages fertility.Martin Luther King was the big tell. A black African named after a white protestant with the addition of the title of King. He was obviously an artificial prophet for a new religion. They even sacrificed him publicly for emphasis. Federal and state workers get the same amount of time off work for him as Jesus Christ gets for Christmas.If we want to fix Western Civilization’s problems we have to start with an in-group fertility ritual and go from there. Even if we cannot remove all the degenerate ideologies, we can force them to pander to our morality for recruits.Interestingly, this is exactly why cults are vilified. They’re doing something hyper-competitive and a threat to the establishment. It’s why Mormons are evil with polygamy but honky dory without it.

                    The LDS are quite fertile with Utah being one of the few states with above replacement fertility unless its finally declined . No one minds if they want to LARP like its 1980Singapore literally did what you suggested  and tried to make its National Night  (its biggest holiday) into a fertility celebration with ads, sponsors (Mentos of all things) and more including government support from its Social Development UnitIts was a complete and utter failure as such rituals have to be organic and believed in by the ruling classSince this is a high information, high tech  urban society  you don’t get to cheat on fertility anymore . No free social capital from rituals  since such traditions are much more applicable to rural  living anywayTo make it work you have to have a highly natal ruling and upper class which we don’t and pay good enough wages over long term so that the 18 year investment (at minimum) that parents have  to make to have children can work, which we can’tWorse automation and computers  means we don’t have enough jobs or job varieties that pay well and it means that other than the very religious, fertility will remain lowIts  2.0  among Hispanics BTW which means they are in slow decline tooNo money, no babiesNow in the very longest time frame, its self correcting. You get a smaller far more religious  population  with much higher fertility . However this time frame will be at the end of modernityBaring some medical breakthroughs we won’t be around for this but give its a couple of centuries and it  wlll be a very religious agrarian society much like it was when we founded it . Probably have a similar tech base too.

                Homeschooling was the norm in the US along with very small schools. In areas where education was valued , this produced a remarkably well educated population all things considered.Teaching at home is  easier than it used to be but I’d suggest that homeschooling families ought to get to know other homeschooling families . Knowing someone who has skill or knowledge in subject matter that you don’t have is invaluable.I don’t have kids but if I did, my math skills beyond maybe basic  algebra are weak and my science could use a upgradeI can learn these things but its also good to have someone around who knows the stuff inside and out.If said families are local enough to you, knowing people with common interests is a great way to network for mutual supportAmericans need to learn to make more friends

        “Having lost a reason to exist, the ruling classes indulge in whatever craziness they can muster.”-   They didn’t lose it.  They never had it.The elite of today, political, commercial, etc., are mostly the children of upper to upper middle class suburbs.  The whole American mythology of “bootstrapping” closed up by the 80’s.  These are the sons and daughters of the 1950’s and 60’s professional class, bar and pool room in the basement, etc.They have no reason to exist because they had no life journey to exist.  Even though they pitched a tent in Peru in the summer of 1991 in an attempt to go on a life journey.  They were handed their status and positions.  The dirtiest secret of this country is the explosion of rife classism.  It creates a society where a Vanderbilt heir, Anderson Cooper, who looks like he’s constantly battling sepsis from his alternative lifestyle, thinks he knows how society works.  We’re run by thousands of Anderson Coopers.  In governments, in media, in education, they’re all the same.  And they haven’t had an original thought in their lives.Compare this to Vladimir Putin.  Born to lower class people in St. Petersburg tenement housing, and climbing a hundred levels to the top of the Russian heap.  He knows his reason to exist.  Leadership can almost be defined by someone’s journey from the periphery to the center, before even assuming power.  If someone is born in the center, by nature he doesn’t belong there, and must be booted to the periphery.

            Hold on there just a minute mister. You’re talking about a “ruling class,” when the problem is “democracy!” Those elites are just insane and anti-white because they are minimally peppered with elected officialdom. Pay no attention to the lion’s share of state employees being civil servants or appointees. Wouldn’t it be great if the Bloombergs became an imperial dynasty? They would surely take good care of you cattle, what since they had a long-term interest in their property.

        When was the last time you saw one of those gay “rainbow” flags defiling the front of a synagogue, the way they routinely defile an Episcopalian church?  Or a “refugees welcome” banner on a synagogue?  Or a BLM banner, the same way they pollute the facades of Christian churches?Cultural corrosion and the nonstop parade of offense and absurdity are straight out of the (((Bolshevik))) Red Terror playbook.  It’s a tactic, nothing more.  Just keep baffling ’em with bullshit so they can’t see what’s really going on.  While the goyim are busy flustering over 10-year-old “transitioning” drag queens dancing in feather boas for gay men, or hand-wringing over “how to fix their broken schools”, which of course are only broken because the Noses flooded them with weaponized feral negroes and immigrants in the first place; the whole time the ship has been sinking from fake holes, the Noses have of course all along been quite busy stealing everything that wasn’t nailed down, and even the things that were.  Look over there, goyim!  A trans-sexual blue-haired walrus is teaching a walking nipple ring how to put a gold-flaked condom onto a gay banana!  (Loots your pension fund while you’re busy gawking.)Don’t worry, though, it’s nearly over: almost everything worth stealing has already been grabbed by the Noses.  Once the last shekel has been stuffed into the last gunnysack, and they’ve all buggered off to China or Tel Aviv or whatever the next designated gangster hideout is, the goys will wake up with a massive hangover, wondering why they’re all covered in glitter and their former country is now packed to the gills with shit-colored rape-apes.  Then they’ll start wondering where they left the blueprints for the cathedral, so they can tear it down and build another holocaust museum in its place.Serves you right for letting the basis of your laws be switched from a recognizable constitution to a bad poem stapled to a Fench statue by a rich slave-owning Jew.  You want symbolism?  Take a selfie with that one.

        Obama’s repeatedly saying “this is not who we are” was the great wake-up call for me. It revealed the totalitarianism of the proposition nation. In a country defined by blood and traditional culture, a myriad of ideas can exist because what defines “who we are” – the ethnic nation – is not being attacked by those ideas.In a proposition nation, especially one that is a full democracy, opposing ideas cannot be tolerated because they challenge the definition, the soul, of the country. “Who we are” is defined by the proposition, so it can’t be challenged. If democracies always murder themselves, proposition nations always become totalitarian.

                    I agree.  A proposition nation needs to get rid of people who don’t follow the proposition.  It needs a state backed church and an inquisition to maintain itself.

                        That’s another thing. Proposition nations and democracies – and especially democratic proposition nations – hate religions, or should I say, competing religions. There can be no other God.
Can’t have priests or pastors telling people that there may be another way to live. Best to get people out of the church or force church leaders to accept the proposition, which is what we see in the United States. Churches can’t shut up about inclusion and immigration, and tolerance for behavior that is explicitly banned by the bible.

                            Yes, unfortunately, many do. But there are as many, if not more, churches that do not accept that the government acts as though it has power to do this, as I hear from church-going acquaintances.
And beyond that, millions of believers who are not joiners don’t go to a church at all and decide based upon what evidence they can gather, what is “the way to live.”….which is what the “That’s not who we are” types want to stomp out of them, as the inner-directed are the most dangerous of all.

        Your observations about pre-revolution France are telling. Wigs, long stockings, rouge on the cheeks, and frilly appendages…. and these were the “men”!!!
It seems revolutions happen not only when times are bad, but when times are bad and the people have lost respect for the “men” in charge. Hunger + contempt = revolution.  Perhaps.

        Virtually everyone I come in contact with loathes Absurdistan’s carnage. And I’m not simply rubbing elbows with right wing boomers either.  I still think this cultural stink bomb is happening far too quickly and that there is not a small possibility of a spectacular pushback by the normals like me, who are still the vast majority report.   It’s largely a very sizable silent majority deciding to avoid candor  in the public square, which skews perception of what the actual spirit of the age consists of. But who wants to stick their neck out in the public square and tell you what they really think in this insane atmosphere?

            The surprisingly positive reaction of shitlib parents to 2010’s “Waiting for Superman” showed that, at least on the parent-child level, even the Woke still have some grounding with reality.  2020 will be a good litmus test for how far they’ve gone downhill since then.

        Whether it’s from too much democracy, the end of a cycle, or CultMarx, unfortunately the rot has distilled into a very simple emotional heuristic that many normies and NPC’s have internalized:instinctive perversity.I think most people have an intuitive sense of right and wrong: it’s wrong to hurt people and steal, it’s wrong to have sex with children, it’s wrong for men to mince around like women.Leftism/degeneracy/decadence trains people to take anything that people instinctively know to be wrong, and celebrate it. I reckon that it started with elites who wanted to set themselves apart normal people, who had naturally healthy moral instincts.The worst part is that this status signalling has trickled down from shitlib elites to normies who virtue signal against other “close-minded” normies: some fat middle-American housewife proudly “transitioning” her son, oozing superiority over … some other fat housewife?Pretty soon, there won’t even be any moral holdouts among the normies, and it will only be (a)imaginedbadwhite normies, or (b)us, the explicitly philosophical right, that they can signal against. We already saw a taste of the latter in the people who wanted a pozzed new Notre Dame to “own the alt-right.”

            I think you feel better even if you just do internet stuff. I started doing the Twitter meme wars, writing for small d-right outlets, and donating money to our guys. Sure, it’s not super manly, but something is better than nothing.
But you’re right, that’s part of the outrage: we used to be a people that could win real wars, but now we’re losing to a bunch of fuck-ups and their barely functional third-world mascots.
Just got to use that for motivation.

                You summed it up succinctly and eloquently, Lineman.Behind that morbidly obese land whale that is teaching our kids and grandkids to embrace and revere all things LGBTQ, behind the illiterate multi-cultis tearing down our statues, behind all the 80 IQ mestizos, squatemaleons, and Muslim invaders demanding our paychecks and our daughters, behind all of these stands the power of the State.Despite owning most of the guns, Normals know that if they attempt to take out the trash, they will be imprisoned or killed by minions of the criminal justice system.  Witness how the leader of the group that was intercepting groups of invaders inside our Southern border and turning them over to Border Patrol, has been arrested by the FBI and is being held WITHOUT BAIL while the State conjures up bogus charges that will send him away for decades.   It is meant to send a strong message to any other Normals who might be getting any ideas, and believe me, ole Norm gets the message loud and clear.Things are currently the way they are because .gov and it’s appointed bureaucrats and running dog media WANT it that way.  Things will eventually come to a head.  But as Claire Wolfe has said,  we are in that awkward time when it is too late to change anything but too early to shoot the bastards.

        “We could simply be seeing what John Adams observed. Democracies always murder themselves.”
The latest example:
#1: GOPe cucks calling for US military intervention in Venezuela while the Pentagon sends cooks and lawyers to our Southern border.
#2: Trump joining with the ‘Rats to spend 2 TRILLION $  on “infrastructure.”  Mao and Stalin used to call these efforts “Five Year Plans.”
This government – this country – is dead.   Like a Brontosaurus with its head bitten off by T Rex, the country is as dead as a hammer.   But the “tail,” i.e. the Masses, don’t know it yet.

            I’m actually all for spending on infrastructure. That’s what healthy societies do. The roads where I live are cratered obstacle courses. The water system is near collapse. But, Congress will never pass that bill, as the GOP’s owners will never allow it. They wants to suck every last dime out for the usual suspects. Even if it did pass, the money would be stolen by those same usual suspects.

This is how ALL empires, nations, and city states have died – always by their own hand. Unfortunately, this is our fate. It is what the NY bankers do their best to try to prevent people from reading what I write because they live in fear of the truth that what will happen once capital wakes up and sells bonds? The bankers will run to government with their hand out again threatening the collapse of government unless they are bailed out one more time for who would sell their bonds? It is the bankers who are paying people to espouse the gold standard without debt reform so they can cash in their debt and walk away. It is not the issue of what is money – it’s the debt and the bankers argue for higher taxes to keep their interest income flowing until they can redeem the bonds and walk away with gold. ”When I see people making excuses for out of control national debt – it’s a big indicator that the person who’s saying is living with at least one foot in globohomo fantasy land.The debt is being used to fund all the things you claim to be against.  For that reason alone – you should stop making excuses for it.

                            The majority of  tax revenue in the US  including most of  what is spent  on the military goes directly into peoples pockets or for health care.The bad stuff gets borrowed.Note too that public social programs are much cheaper to run than private  ones.  Government charity is 80-90% aid sometimes more, Private Charity is often the oppositewith 2/3 more more going to adds and bloated salariesYou want to make sure people have food, health care and such , have the State do it, its much cheaper per dollar given and can scale to any  problemThe long and short is modernity, good and ill is expensive as hell to run , costing more in State spending , wages (the 80% city dwellers will not have kids unless wages  meet a comfortable cost of living) and all around general  costs for everythingModernity almost mandates national healthcare as well since the economic costs of people working with say influenza and infecting others are very high.Trying to cut our way to prosperity will failAlso you really can’t do the whole “low wages uber alles”  thing if you want anyone but Amish farmers to have kids.  The US total fertility rate has been below replacement for near 50 years, more if you count the depression and its mostly economic.You can’t church your way out. You need to pay money and lots of it, after you fix divorceThe way you cut costs is to repatriate roughly 30-50 million people and than tightly control imports and banking  This pushes wages up and since the money is contained domestically and used for productive enterprise  its recaptured thus lowering the burden.There is a huge caveat to this though, technology and preference  means that there are large categories of stuff that there is  may be less spending onMedia is a big example and I suspect demand for automobiles may well decline if self driving cars make it into production. There is no reason for an infrastructure  for media, no CD stores if everyone is downloading or using SpotifyLess need for DVD’s with Netflix and so onUber isn’t solvent  but if automated cabs become a thing,  you’ll see lot less car buying. Why not rent when you need it.This means more and more of your paycheck and taxes will go to buffering the effects of the now smaller economy.There is no way around this either.  Either you get a lot of State jobs as a buffer into the middle class and family formation or a  sclerotic mixed economy with a low work week, everyone getting some welfare and a lot of part time work oh and no kidsThe only way this can be made tolerable is a very homogeneous society so that the various tribes and races won’t be at warThe US does not want to be Scandinavia or Europe but it may be the only way we can keep it together in a world with the Internet and automationIf we dodge this , we won’t have such a horrible cram down of a welfare state but its hard to predict that far

                            Is the debt too high? Yes.
Is the money being used for mostly awful things? Yes.
Is the debt going to sink us within the next couple of years? No.
An adult country would have minimal debt and only run it up during wartime and maybe massive recessions/depressions – though even that is debatable. But we don’t live in an adult country. However, there’s a lot of rot to run through before we hit a debt crisis.

                                The US  is certainly not run by adults but historically has basically never been able to get by without borrowing no matter how tiny the State.The 19th century and the 20th century was debt city and in the last 50 years we had maybe 10% of the time a balanced budget.A consistent balanced budget  cant be done and you can’t cut you way to prosperity when 40% of the GDP is government spendingThe old guard of the Republicans and Libertarians  assume that this spending is a drag on the economy and that a massive cut in spending would set the economy freeThe exact opposite is true, only state spending is keeping the US from utter economic ruinWe are in a hellish efficiency trap with too low a demand for labor and a lot of reasons, good and ill, wages can never go up.  Outside of government, wages are spending and are the economy since they are demand.And to skeptics  if you decided to say phase out social security and medicare, savings would go through the roof. Assuming the  taxes collected was given to the employee and not to the bigwigs which is honestly risible, the required savings so people can stop working at say 68 would cripple the economyYou cannot have an economy with 30% savings since there is no one out there to buy goods and you’ll be lucky if anyone has children c.f JapanAs it is the natural deflation in the economy will ensure that the US can keep borrowing and minting for far longer than you might thinkThere is no easy “it all falls apart” out. Its going to dragon on for a very long time and baring some touchstone event, door to door gun confiscation maybe , nothing will happen.Things will get worse and worse and maybe the States and localities will just stop following orders and go federalist with the possibility that sometime in the next 50 years the US will just kind of all apart

The Dissident Right is not for Economic Liberals but for Economic Conservatives.Go back among your own kind on the country clubbers and the cucks where you belong.You will have regulation , either  from  the Left or the Populists Right . No one will allow you to cheat, pollute , chisel , arbitrage wages down, flood the US with job killing imports  or avoid taxesYou don’t like that? Move to some Libertarian nation. I hear Somalia is nice this time of year .

You have to realize it’s a con game, the Fed lends money to the Treasury to lend money to the Fed to lend to the… etc.  It’s a 2 party game of musical chairs and there’s two chairs.

                                No one knows how long mass trust (in the IOU ocean) will last. The dynamics of markets for intangible goods (like bonds) are not understood. It’s all nothing but mass psychology, AKA fashion. Eventually it will end. When it does, the cupboard will be suddenly revealed to be bare. All the promises to pay (from pensions and “entitlements” to bank accounts and debt maturity) will evaporate. It could have happened 20 years ago. It might not happen for 10 more. Or it could happen next year. Anyone who says they know is lying.

I suggest youi read what the Weimar Republic did to its currency and why Hitler came to power.  After all its only inflation-ah to be in Venezuela where inflation has exceeded 2 million per cent a year!

                                Given the increase in the GDP , that candy bar now costs  less in adjusted dollars what it did in 1968 .It was 5 cents an ounce in 1968 with a just under a 1 trillion GDPThe current cost is 50 cents an ounce with just under a 20 trillion GDPIt costs half as much in adjusted dollarsIf you factor in wage arbitrage  though wages as percentage GDP are half what they were in 1968, well the candy bar costs exactly the same amount of time and money.What’s expensive is housing in areas where there is work. It hasn’t  remotely kept pace with the GDP increaseMore importantly lack of regulation of foreigners and big investors along with some growth regulations ha made housing unaffordable for manyThis along with student debt has hurt family formation dramatically

Doom mongering is what I saw in Venezuela and the Lefties told us paradise had been achieved and it took a decade for the wealthiest nation in Latin America to start eating zoo animals and its pets.   But hey, the Leftists achieved equality for the vast majority of people.   Now they have no food, water, nor electricity nor toilet paper.   That’s what the Left always provides because money grows on trees.And as Leftists always say, you can live in your parent’s basement.

                    It’s all relative. U.S. debt to GDP is ~100%. That’s pretty middle of the pack. Also, with interest rates are all time lows, so the cost of that debt is negligible.Of course, that could all change in a couple of years. Presumably, we’ll have another recession in the next two or three years, pushing up that figure. Then you have the boomers’ medicare and SS costs, which will also push up that number. So let’s say that number goes up to 130% or so in five years. Even that’s not too bad. Heck, Japan is 250% – though their debt is own almost entirely by Japanese.The real question at that point is interest rates. If they go from 0.5% real to 2% real, well, that’s going to take a major chunk of the budget. Of course, Pres. Harris could always just raise taxes on those evil whites.

                        The dollar has value as long as the holders of them believe it does.  In that sense, the rest of us are in alignment with the powers that be.  They hold dollars too, and have a vested interest in maintaining their worth.  Not to say the wheels won’t come off, but the dollar is a unique combination of a shorthand store of value, and an easily negotiable instrument of payment for purchase.  Most tools of trade are one or the other, and not as efficient and frictionless at either task.  We have time on this, until we don’t.  Debasement still marches on, and every paper currency eventually goes to zero.

                        GDP is a lie.The moment debt stops growing, its artificial support to “GDP” will evaporate and GDP will evaporate faster than water in Death Valley summer. No one knows when this will happen. But it will happen.

                        Take a look at Venezuela’s numbers in 2014; odd how they compare with the US today.   And of course we all know there is nothing to fear.   Venezuela is in such fine condition, nothing to see here, move along, all is well, spend, spend, spend.
So people like me can buy it all up at 5 cents on the dollar when the collapse comes.   But as Silly Citizen tells us, all is well, spend, spend, spend.

                        I guess this means any debt to the Federal Government is also a fiction.
BTW – at what level does debt become non-fictional?
And if 2 billion or trillion for “infrastructure” is good (sorry, I forgot which number I heard on the news today), then 20 billion or trillion for said infrastructure is AWESOME. It’s all fictional so let’s do this.

When the dollar ceases being the worlds reserve currency.  Which will happen at some point. But is probably centuries away.

By the way I collect currency.  I have hundred billion notes from weimar Germany, Hungary, Zimbabwe, Poland, and other states that believed debt was a fiction.
I am a trillionaire based on these currencies holding..

                    They don’t.
They collapse once the debt starts being called in.
And the debt gets called in when the people holding it come to realize that it’s not going to be paid.
That realization that it’s not going to be paid –  comes when you look at who is holding the debt – and realize that they’ve gone mad and have therefore lost their capability to generate income and pay back said debt.
Ergo:   The time draws nigh

What makes me wonder about the dollar is this stuff about UFOs they’ve been floating lately, as if to make it look like US has secret UFO tech… are they worried China and Russia are catching up and people are seeing the US as a paper tiger?I’m way more worried about some kind of military conflict involving weapons of mass destruction, particularly with lunatics in charge of the asylum.

                                I’ve been hearing the end is nigh since I was a boy in the 80’s . The economy is still kind of functional, the birth rate close to the same (1.8 vs 1.6 now for Whites) and the checks still cashGiven there is a lot of ruin in a nation and economies can stay irrational for longer than you can stay solvent, clown world economy may go on for a long time yetIts going to get worse but collapse is not guaranteed and may happen so slowly that what would normally be regarded as “the end” will just be the new normalAnyway counting on a collapse is just a way to dodge the real responsibility which is to figure out what kind of society you want and to get together with others make it happen

                            A.B., If we declared bankruptcy or some other onerous manipulation of our debt, then I suspect two things would happen:  we’d lose our status as the world’s exchange currency, and logically then we’d have to pay for goods in some other more reliable “currency”. In short, we’d beggar ourselves more than our creditors.
Now I suspect that suits you fine and seems to work into your general slant on things, but such a collapse would make the Great Depression look like a mild downturn in comparison.

                        Even when it comes to finances, common sense shoulders in from time to time. If you owe me a million, I’m a millionaire on paper; if you owe a billion, then I’m a billionaire on paper; up to a point I can repackage these obligations as ‘assets’. The value of such ‘assets’ (for me and for people I do business with) consists in the assumption that you will pay me, when I need the money or by terms of the loan contract. This is called “good faith and credit.”Of late the shills of unlimited government spending are explaining to us that ‘fiat money’ isn’t like real money. It’s BETTER than real money, because it isn’t tied to debt or obligation. It’s tied only to “good faith and credit.”And what can elicit our good faith and credit better than a government that openly ignores its own debt? Ah, I forgot: We’re in the good ol’ USA – those greenbacks will inspire awe around the world until the end of time.

                That is precisely the problem. We use words like “spending on infrastructure” and to you and me it means repairing bridges and roads. To people in D.C. it means a way to spread bribes funded by tax-payers to politically influential donors who in turn ensure the re-election of lawmakers. In fact, the last thing they want is to actually repair a road because then they don’t have a reason to do the whole process all over again. The goal of infrastructure spending is the opposite of repairing the infrastructure.

                        You’re right about the left. You’re also right about the establishment members who call themselves “the right.”As for the real “right,” though – yes, they would end abortion if they could. We’re talking the people, not the politicians who just mouth certain opinions while their hearts are elsewhere.Backtrack just for a moment. The debt became much more serious  when W spent like a  madman, followed by O, who was in charge when the debt doubled what it had been under all presidents before him, when totaled.The biggest reason is the “stimulus” bill, passed right after he came into office, which, oddly enough, was touted as being largely for “infrastructure,” while all we saw were signs saying “This project (what project?) brought to you by the Stimulus.” What happened? Has the average voter already forgotten that?

                    I lived in one place in California for over thirty years, and read the papers every day (back when that was a thing). I was very familiar with what roads needed repairing, and where new roads needed to go. My opinions were frequently reinforced by newspaper articles detailing highway-expenditure proposals, none of which ever went anywhere.Until Obama came along with his manna from heaven for shovel-ready projects, giving states latitude on what to spend it on. A lot of road construction and inconvenience occurred, absolutely NONE of it anything that had been needed or proposed.Highway 101 through Monterey County, a sort of Frogger course of potholes, was given mile-long left-side get-up-to-speed lanes everywhere crossing traffic was allowed. This was an idea no one had ever had, a solution to a problem that didn’t exist, and the potholes of course are still there.

                        There are people who trust the federal government. Then there are those who don’t. Watching so many go to DC and become multi-millionaires, often staying around for life, colored my view.We watched as state after state voted against gay rights, but SCOTUS knows best…the street poop thing has spread from Third World migrants and is allowed by local dim politicians. Good thing it’s not before the Supreme Court, or we’d prob all be stepping over poop.It is hard to decide which is more corrupt-gov or MNC’s; for a long time, I shared your view. Now I’m of the idea that I can go to another corporation if this one is unsuitable, but voting in a different congress makes no difference at all (Uniparty.)

                The same phenomena is spreading to the rest of Murrlin. Most Montgomery county roads are terrible to drive on, even in Chevy Chase. The liberal hell scape known as Columbia has been importing only the finest from Lagos, and is slowly turning into a suburban version. Now all those soccer mom’s are fleeing and buying mcmansions in what used to be farmland in my little country enclave. This is spreading even though Carroll and Fredneck counties (though much less). New housing “developments” with pithy signs advertising prices “starting from the low 800s”, a guard stand, and HOA fees as a way to keep the melanin enriched out without being explicit.Methinks all of this behavior derives from the fact that most Murrlin residents are suckling on the gubmint teet in some way. Bureaucracy encourages this passive, anti social, atomizing, yet “opulent” behavior. The few people who do honest work (including the select few in gubmint jobs) that I’ve talked to are very aware of these things. Leads me to suspect white collar busy work has destroyed the minds and morality of the 80% of people who are functionally useless.

                Healthy societies do not borrow from unborn generations to satisfy their desires.

            Carl,POTUS has not joined with the Rats.  Think about this:  What is one thing that everyone does when contemplating filing for bankruptcy?  They run up their charge card balances, buying new stuff.  Why?  Because they know they’re not going to pay for it anyway.POTUS is gunning for the Fed – look at what he has done so far:  Used their own metrics to make the economy look awesome.  It’s not “awesome”.  It sucks.  But the Fed cannot criticize POTUS, otherwise they would have to admit they use the same fake alchemy to fudge their books and increase/decrease inflation.  POTUS is going to audit the Fed.  And then use the results of that audit to dismantle and get rid of it.POTUS is, in effect, going to make the Fed pay for our new infrastructure and rebuilding the military.   Which is fine with me – the Fed should be audited, dismantled and then burned to the foundations – all members carted off to the Stoney Lonesome.  Forever.  Central banks – the Fed included – have engaged in the biggest theft in human history.  And I’m fine with POTUS head-faking one way (“joining the Rats”) and then doing something else (getting rid of the Fed).  It’s his hallmark.

        “One of the defining features of this age is that it is hard to keep pace with the absurdity we see promoted by the people who rule over us.”
I think they do it simply to humiliate us, to display their power, to crush all tradition. They want to keep doing it to make us afraid. If they can force you to accept hairy men in sun dresses in the lady’s room, they can do anything they like.

                    Nuclear option is strategic, albeit we are making them smaller and more tactical with our new renewal program.  The point is that there is no point in killing a fly with a sledgehammer.  Only if the opposition becomes large and centralized would such a weapon prove effective.  However, that seems unlikely if we are talking about small percentages of patriots resisting/contesting control in smallish groups.  Imagine the UK fighting the IRA back in the 70’s with nukes.

            “Political correctness is communist propaganda writ small. In my study of communist societies, I came to the conclusion that the purpose of communist propaganda was not to persuade or convince, nor to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the less it corresponded to reality the better. When people are forced to remain silent when they are being told the most obvious lies, or even worse when they are forced to repeat the lies themselves, they lose once and for all their sense of probity. To assent to obvious lies is to co-operate with evil, and in some small way to become evil oneself. One’s standing to resist anything is thus eroded, and even destroyed. A society of emasculated liars is easy to control. I think if you examine political correctness, it has the same effect and is intended to.  ”Theodore Dalrymple

        One of the best cultural border defenses is having a language of your own. Like with English and Spanish, there are hundreds of millions of non-French, native French-speakers; Portuguese, Dutch and even German have native speakers outside Europe. But if you have the amazing privilege of being born Danish, you have your own, tribal safe space, with a complete set of cultural codes embedded, which are exclusive to your people.Barring a few Inuit, Icelanders and Faroese, nobody outside Denmark speaks Danish, so there’s (nobody) looking over your shoulder when and how you debate politics. This makes Danish politics absurdly parochial at times, but I believe it is the main reason Denmark is allowed much more freedom of speech than America: if the globalist discovered how we debate Islam and immigration, they’d nuke us from orbit.Or rather, I suspect they know, because there are special people in Denmark too, but because of the language barrier, the cancer is contained to Scandinavia so they don’t care all that much, they can always deal with us once they’ve destroyed America.I realise this is not very helpful, but there you have it.

            “If the globalists discovered how we debate Islam and immigration…”See, that is how you know you’ve already lost.  What grounds for “debate” are there at all, to begin with?  You want to “debate” Islam and immigration?  Do you debate cancer?  Do you debate a tapeworm?1.  Islam has no place anywhere in Europe, not ANYWHERE, and no place whatsoever in the Christian West.  Muslims have no business in Denmark.  None.2.  Denmark is a tiny place.  It is literally “Dane-March”, the land of the Danes.  It is all they have.  There is no room for any immigration in Denmark, and certainly not for rape-ape immigration.   To open the floor to debate is to lose the debate.Stop debating.

                Do you debate cancer?Yes, of course. And we debate immigration in much the same vein: how do we put a stop to it?Stop debating.Great idea! Maybe if we stop talking about it, it will go away by itself. Just like cancer.Trump would never stand a chance in a Danish election, because he’s too soft on both immigration and Islam –  even Campaign Trail Trump was waaaay softer on immigration than Danish lefties: You want to make illegal immigration illegal? Well, duh!And “Dane-march” literally means “borderland of the Danes”, not “land of the Danes” – the border in question being the border to the Carolingian Empire.

                    Just to give you an example of the different level of discourse, in the last election, the four (!) winning parties ran on these slogans:– “A Crash Stop for Immigration” (and in Denmark, that means ALL immigration, illegal or otherwise)– “Stop Nazi-Islam!” (Granted, they got in hot waters for that one.)– “Closed Coffers” (For immigrants. This was from a minuscule party of economic libertarians, and their full slogan was “Open Borders – Closed Coffers”.– “You Know Where We Stand” (This was from the Danish People’s Party, the nationalist-populist party who have been fighting to stop third-world immigration for 25 years. )The latter got the most votes, which in Continental parliamentary tradition means you get to pick the prime minister. The result amounted roughly to Marine Le Pen winning the presidential election.And now we face a new election within three months, and some dude turns up in the deepest Mohammadan ghetto, wraps a Koran in bacon and sets it alight. The POC did their POC thing, and the police had to use tear gas and even hard ammo to protect his free speech.His little dog-and-pony show provided the signatures to get on the national ballotin three days!Serious parties struggle for years, without ever getting the required signatures.Remember his name: Rasmus Paludan. You’ll be hearing from him soon.

                            I’m afraid it’s the white-pill version. The Danish People’s Party turned out to be managed opposition and the establishment parties were lying, of course. At the moment, there are effectively zero anti-immigration members of the Danish parliament, zero true nationalists. They’re globalists, every single one of them.
But that’s another story. My point was that this is where the voters are, this is where the Overton Window is.

                                    [face palm]Indeed.2015 was one of the most important elections in modern Danish history, as the Danish People’s Party for the first time had the power to deliver on almost three decades worth of promises.The fact that they turned globalist when the chips were down, is why Paludan got his signatures. The 2015 general election was as close to a plebiscite on immigration as you can possibly get, the voters delivered a resounding no, and the politicians delivered more of the same. So why should voters take politics seriously, if politics doesn’t take voters seriously?Well, this election is going to be about immigration and Islam front, back and centre.

        I was thinking about the late Roman Empire period all through the article too.  People who get their history from Monty Python or SNL may think that the Romans always practiced decadent feasts with vomit rooms and orgies.  But the reality is that kind of rot only set in as the collapse was imminent
Does the moral rot cause the collapse or the impending collapse drive the rot?  Either way, they seem tightly linked.

            Vomitoriums  were not for binging and purging , that’s a myth. It ,means roughly “theater exit”There certainly was decadence at the time but that was not a thing,What killed The Western Roman Empire was what is killing us, urbanization and immigration. All the wealth wealth went to the cities and too many people stopped having families.If it gets too hard to make a living and pay the bills in an urban society and welfare won’t cut it than that society dies.Our society  richly deserves what its going to get .A well armed populace so cucked by individualism they have no sense of national or group identity doesn’t deserve a countryThey can’t even organize well enough to vote solutions much less shoot their way outSow, Reap

                Political craziness sure helped kill the Republic and then the Empire.  In 408 Stilicho, the greatest living Roman General, lost a political battle and was executed.  Two years later, Alaric (pictured at the top of this page) and his Visigoth army were sacking Rome.

            Samuel Dill’s “Roman Society in the Last Century of the Western Empire” should be required reading for those who comment on the ‘decline of Rome’.
Rome “declined” longer than the USA has existed or likely will exist. If only we could look forward to a “decline” like Rome’s, I’d be voting for Caracalla in 2020.

            AB Prosper is speaking my mind on a bunch of these, but I’ll add this re Drake: careful what you believe about myths of the foundation and traditions of western Civilization told by *ahem* those who oppose the West.  Catherine the Great objectively did not have a special bed made for her to have sex with horses, but a certain group she banished back to the Pale of Settlement and expropriated now teach us our history, so now people think she fornicated with beasts.  Now, who was it that the Romans defeated, enslaved, and expelled from the middle East?Every.  Single. Time.

        The speed of the craziness that Z talks about is amazing.  To me, gay “marriage” is absurd to begin with.  But until very recently, it was at least a topic open to debate.  A lot of the democrats, including Obama I think, started out with no marriage but civil unions are O.K.  Now, nothing less than all-out worship of LGBTetc is tolerated.  Questioning gay marriage is unthinkable.

            Even it the 70’s and 80’s it wasn’t the elites who were keeping the lid on the nuttiness – it was the blue-collar base of the DNC.  Gary Studds could win elections on Cape Cod despite his blatant degeneracy.  But the party as a whole would at least pretend outrage at that kind of immorality.
But now that the party has turned on whites and the working-class, they are free to embrace their true immorality.

            It seems like the Current Year has become the Current Day, where every morning you wake up and something that has been considered wrong for all of history is now a Moral Necessity and you will lose your job and reputation if you don’t pretend that it has always been right.
I find it interesting that the word “Kafkaesque” has largely dropped out of use just as public life became unbearably Kafkaesque.

                    Bingo! It’s also the sign of a people with too much money, food, and WAY too much time on their hands as a result of the wealth and bounty. These are the “problems” of people who have never had to struggle a day in their miserable lives. And I use the word “miserable” advisedly and deliberately because in the absence of *real* problems and struggles, they manufacture them, for the human organism *requires* adversity and struggle to thrive. Without it, we get an open-air Absurdistan. All this BS about transgenderism–well, the very corruption of the word “gender” itself–and feminism and “rayciss” and all the rest of it are the manufactured problems of people leading aimless, pointless, miserable lives.

            Sounds good in theory, but in reality it will never happen. The unspoken part of this article is that this urgency and aggression didn’t arise in a vacuum. One thing the shitlib left is, if nothing else, are absolute spineless cowards.They are the pack of hyenas and jackals nipping at the heels of a single lion. Once they sense the lion is weak enough to be attacked 10 against 1, they go in for the kill. They learned this behavior I suspect from their minority ‘pets’ who very much operate this way as well. I spent enough time around them in my youth to know the behavior quite well.So where I’m going with this is— you can stand over that ‘gravestone’ with a gun. And when the blue haired nose pierced ham beast lesbian arrives to knock it over she won’t be even a little afraid of your pop gun because she will have ten armed police officers behind her ready to crack your skull open so she can desecrate that grave with glee. If you doubt this, I refer you to yesterday’s article about Cville.We are in a precarious position because you don’t just fight the mutants and misfits. If that were the case, this would have been over decades ago because 10 lions can trounce an entire herd of wild hyenas. No you fight the full power and force of the State. This means lawfare, media bias, academia, and most critically to your scenario, the militarized police who like Z said yesterday will gun you down w/o a moment’s hesitation if told to do so. They may even agree with your cause, but they sure as f-ck are not going to risk a pension or their reputation to speak up. Trained dogs are just that. Trained. Dogs.

                I think you are taking my figurative description way too literally.  I don’t disagree with your conclusions, but I see my first comment as more of a “where we fit in the situation” rather than a thing to be done.  The graveyard is imaginary, the gravestones don’t exist, and our standing over them with guns is as abstract a notion as the old “Uncle Sam wants you” posters.  Z creates a vivid imaginary scenario, and I am simply trying to imagine our role in the picture.

                    No I read you loud &amp; clear, but my point is that in any way you try to defend that which is targeted for destruction you will be hit by the force of the State not just the force of the freak, so be willing to accept this mantle. It is a heavy burden few are willing to bear, and rightly so. My ending point was simply that if it comes down to a meat space confrontation you will, in fact, be facing armed thugs with badges protecting Globohomo and their agenda.

                        Agreed.  Venezuela is instructive.  People interviewing the “man in the street” find that few of them have much of a opinion on things, at least an opinion that they are willing to share.  They are hunkered down, enduring the situation as best they can.  There are a few people on the “coup” side, and the force of Maduro’s authority on the other, and everyone else is simply trying to stay out of the way.  Most people feel no agency to affect things, or are at least they are not willing to exercise whatever agency they might have.  Given that, my bet is on Maduro, and a Cuban future for Venezuela.  Here would probably not go down much differently.  Part of the globohomo onslaught is to comprehensively remove people’s perception that they have any say in the matter.

                            @SidVic- Not trying to be Debbie Downer or Blackpill Bill, my intention is not to demoralize, it is to educate so people fight ‘smarter not harder’. Direct confrontation is a recipe for disaster. I say this again, from traumatic personal experience.This is a 4G Warfare scenario. You are the guerilla facing incredibly asymmetric force which will be applied in all arenas against you not just meat space physical violence.I could write a ‘how to’ manual on 4G warfare and ways to disrupt this but this is not the forum and I am -definitely- not the guy given my history and the radars I exist on already. I’m certain creative people can think of all manner of ways to disrupt and discredit w/o my implicit instructions.As for the weapons floating around out there, you are way low. It is 300 million but here is the rub. They don’t fire themselves contrary to what gun grabbing libs think. The force of will to use it is the key and unless you do it as a mass movement you will be made an example of, so don’t fixate on weapons that are not useful right now. “Too late to start voting to early to start sh00ting.” That is where we live right now for better or worse.

                                This is a point that I have made elsewhere to some American friends who believe their AR15s will somehow keep the blue-haired beasts from their doors. And what, pray tell, are you going to do with your AR15s when they show up? Open fire? You’ll die in a hail of return fire or spend the rest of your life in prison.I support my American comrades in their fight for their 2A rights but I do wonder sometimes if the guns in your closets have provided you all with a false sense of security. Yes, you’ve still got your guns but you’ve lost just about everything else.

                        The Booby agrees with Apex regarding your odds in a fight with the establishment..You can’t fight the police and the military, but you can weaken the state. Stop feeding the parasites.Reduce economic activity as much as possible. Shop outside the official economy where sales taxes and payroll taxes are collected. Do as little work as possible. When situations will allow it, do as shitty a job as possible. If you work for the gov’t suck the system dry and do as poor a job as you can get away with.Buy land, gold, and hard assets instead of putting money in banks.It’s not as crazy as it sounds. One bad recession may be all it takes to bankrupt the pension plans of all those police officers, the trained dogs as someone called them, and the rest of the gov’t workers.

                            Ten-plus years of zero interest rates have already assured the failure of those pension funds that have not already failed. The process is already underway. It can not be stopped.

The Booby just might take you up on that.

Stay tuned….

                Exactly right Brother so we would be fighting our own kind first in the form of law enforcement and then when we are weakened the hyenas will come in and finish us off…That’s why I advocate so much for Community so that the law enforcement is us and we can focus our whole force on the hyenas…Also don’t just stop at Community you keep building on that and pushing into surrounding areas taking county after county until you have the state then it’s on to other states…

                    MRV, I doubt it.  You make the same mistake as folk often do wrt to SSI, i.e., that the plans pay one month, then stop paying the next as the last dollar is withdrawn.  WRT SSI, the situation—by statute—is that the payment amount is reduced—across the board—until there is enough monthly income to pay out a portion of a recipient’s former monthly retirement check. A haircut, not a cessation, currently estimated at a 25% reduction.Likewise, State plans have income from younger employee’s and investments.  Some States have horrible liabilities and are basically insolvent—unless their promised payouts are drastically reduced—or State taxes drastically raised. That mixture will be the case, as it must be the case, either through emergency legislation or court decree.  There is precedent for this as well.Do/will folk like getting perhaps only 50% of what they are “entitled”, hell no.  But that is the result of a bad investment decision on your part when you undertook to work for a public institution run by pol’s. But whatever it is, it is not a cessation—which is what I assume you mean when saying “those plans will be gone in 10 years.”

                Yes. There seems to be two sides of the of the normies: wards or agents of the State and wards or agents of usury.A cop will kick my door in long before some antifag grows the balls.Ive got some good toys and some training but all that evaporates when the tank pulls up and six or eight pensions and medical bennies are on the line.The rest of the males on the street won’t risk an ill timed frown, no matter how clownish the circumstance, for fear that the purple haired HR lady or neighborhood diversity sergeant pulls their number.In which case the private school tuition, status mcmansion mortgage and three car payments bury him.He can liquidate his 401k for some float but his old lady prolly wont stick around for that so he can talk to the Judge about potential income formulas in child support.The economic precariousness of the comfortable modern life is a big part of State control. Status quo is addictive.

        Since the end of the Cold War we have nothing to keep the ruling class “honest” and on their toes. During that time they worried about Ivan rolling through the Fulda Gap and taking Europe.When that fear ended, the ruling class was free to do as they please namely kick the lower classes in the teeth, Thatcher in England privatized and gutted  their industrial base and permanently wrecked the English working class in the process. She turned productive workers into boozed up proles that did nothing all day. She was a disaster. She also downsized the military to the point Britain could no longer defender her assets.  Clinton shifted the Democrats from white working class to minorities and white urbanites, he embraced globalization and gutted our industrial base and started killing off white blue collars and the middle-class.  After those two things really went to hell for the lower class whites and the West in general.Now days the ruling class  is like Tiberias or Commodus they can and do indulge in anything they damn do well please with no consequences.   ANow they openly state they want whites dead and gone and have declared war on us in terms of destroying our culture, history, values and any who stand in opposition to them and Trump turned out to be one their biggest assets. by pulling a Merkel and inviting in all of South America.

            You’re right.  Trump is a sort of updated version of Thatcher/ Reagan.
Tough talk and talk talk talk… to act as a pressure relief valve for your supporters…but do little or nothing of consequence to actually accomplish what you’ve promised.
Then go full tilt in the opposite direction.  As long as you occasionally say the right thing or make a symbolic gesture every now and then, your supporters will follow you into the abyss thinking it’s a mountain top.
Collapse is inevitable.  Stop feeding the beast.  Protect you and yours.

        “Saying “this is not who we are” seems to track with not knowing who we are or why we are even a “we” anymore.”
One of those profound things no one stops to consider. Since no one agrees on who “we” are anymore, how can one say something is “not who we are”?

        Always remember: “There is nothing new under the Sun.”  This is no different, and the reasons for the every spiraling descent is as simple as Eve’s disobedience in the Garden–Man (to include women, of course) is a fallen sinner hellbent on listening to his own wants and desires, lusting for power and control. . .   all the time disobeying God.

        This quote from your article sums it up and each of the two sentences speaks to both sides of the problem. “Having lost a reason to exist, the ruling classes indulge in whatever craziness they can muster. Maybe our rulers are so alien to us that their sense of normal falls well outside what the rest of us consider decent and proper.”To elaborate on the first sentence: I would say that the big transition that has occurred in the last few decades is from the dominant interpretation of progress being the one defined by a sort of scientific humanism to one where it is defined by an egalitarian concept of “social justice”. Scientific and technological progress used to be the main way modern democracies established legitimacy. It’s very hard after all to argue that a society capable of moon missions and Polio cures has no value. Some argue that the technological project is stalled. I think this is true but I would contend that the primary reason for that is that the ruling elite lost interest in it because doing so freed up more resources for them to skim. Space elevators and particle accelerators are fantastically expensive, trannie story time only costs whatever a cheap wig and makeup go for at Walmart. Essentially, the rulers decided that the “vig” on the old sci-fi future was too small. They wanted a bigger cut.To elaborate on the second sentence: This is where they made what is going to prove to be their fatal mistake. Generating enthusiasm among the masses for technology that lengthens lives and makes life easier and more interesting was never difficult. Most scientific projects sell themselves or only require a bit of simple exposition to connect them to that network of “good things” that exists in everyone’s brain. By contrast, poz initiatives tend to meet with a mixture of only weak support on the one hand and absolutely furious opposition on the other. Even things like “gay rights” (really compulsory acceptance of homosexuality) took decades to ram down everyone’s throats and are still met with this mixture of indifference and opposition among normal people. The elite doesn’t see this because they’ve always been more likely to believe in utopian ideas of heaven on earth while the common man is more likely to just believe in the old fashioned idea of heaven in heaven.  Also, while the common man’s religion is more metaphysical than the elite’s, his daily concerns are much more pragmatic since he is always closer to real hardship than any member of the elite. In practical matters things have been getting worse for him for decades and the elite can only counter with “well at least now you have the right to unlimited buggery, aren’t you grateful?”. The answer is that no, he isn’t, and he’s hopping mad over all the ways his life keeps getting worse. A case in point would be the yellow vest uprising in France or simply the surprising success of the Trump campaign.

        “In fact, in a world without form, the hunt for something to level becomes increasingly urgent as there is less and less to knock over.“Here, Evan Sayet’s thesis applies well. To summarize, our overculture has concluded that because no moral system (no set of rights and wrongs) anywhere has ever succeeded in eliminating all poverty, war and strife, the real problem can only be found in the very attempt to be right and moral. Any inequalities amongst people therefore must be the result of the worst sin ever: discrimination; in other words, someone cheated. They really think equality is the state of human nature, and this being so, the only reason whites created skyscrapers and Africans barely understand the wheel, is whitey rigs the game. Hence the frantic search for ever more marginalized groups to herald as victims worthy of redress and praise.Most of this is signaling, because as Charles Murray observed, the inhabitants in the super zip codes rarely practice what they preach. However, they will foist their degenerate leveling on the rest of us.

        Abstractionism and universalism seem to go hand in hand, and cycle into predominance in the minds of elites at times when societies reach a plateau of development, and the people who get the worst cases of the infection tend to be the kind that go about seeking statues to overturn. It is as if they are born with the idea that if a society is not waxing great that it must be in decline, and there can be no state of stable equilibrium for man in the mass, and it is not worth seeking this.Thus we have schools and universities teaching these tenets, and only them, and our diplomats and politicians have spent their entire lives swimming in an ocean the surface they have never dared peek out of.A normal world may as well be a foreign planet to them.

        US Democracy is so democratic that the two parties are in tight orbit around a collection of issues which benefit single digit percentages of the population.
Of course, this will be argued as a feature and not a bug. After all, the elite are made of better stuff (three souls instead of two – just to start) and keep the even keel, etc.

        Maybe democracy doesn’t create the problem but is a bellwether telling us that a festering problem has become very serious. Neither France nor Rome were democratic.In nature complex systems often break down when they become too complex, or they break off and continue to evolve along different paths.  Human organizations are part of nature.  At some point we reach a complexity horizon where a naturally evolved system can no longer function. An entity has too many demands made upon it or it has too many masters so it ceases to function properly.We have always been a nomadic species, always chasing some frontier.  North America probably extended the life span of Europe by having that frontier.  In contrast, China which had no frontier into which to expand, went into stasis for 1000 years.We always seem to need a frontier and a great dream, even if unattainable, to pursue.  The modern West, Bourbon France, the late Roman Empire, Imperial China…They no longer had a frontier within which to pursue a great dream.Stasis seems to set the stage for decline.

            I think we’re all coming to the same conclusion using different paths.  They all terminate at the same trailhead.  Detached….aloof….degenerate…oligarchy.  Something that naturally springs out of every type of society.  Something that is part of human nature.  To rule and consolidate.  And something that’s torn out by the roots when it becomes too old and diseased.  They no longer bear fruit.  They become a child like Eloi.   Effete.

        Also note that the pace of craziness is accelerating. The Democrat Party is an archetypical example of this. Nancy Pelosi is a true loon, but even she is getting overwhelmed by the craziness to her Left within her own caucus. Had Hillary been elected, it is very likely that we would be in actual hot civil war by now. Trump’s presence (and the overheated economy) is tamping down fervor for revolution, that is only temporary. Eventually, somethings gotta give, and it will likely be sooner rather than later.

Although this is small potatoes, how about we also reclaim our language! Since when did we descend to call raging elephant seals Ladies.  Since when did we fall to describe a violent murderer as a Gentleman. Our language is now mirroring the spiral into insanity. Words are used to shapeshift and mesmerize by the Left.  No rules stick to the Left.Woman is a gender. A Lady is recognized in a glance. “Lady” is a title that defines an Elegant Gracious Loving Woman who uses etiquette and diplomacy in both public and private matters. She is regal. Her Beauty comes from within. How’s that for reclaiming the definition!Okay….small potatoes when the fecal matter hits the fan, yet reclaiming our standards is important also. Their attack is death by a thousand cuts.

                On and on it goes, where it ends nobody knows. I said 20 years ago what this country needs is a good depression to set things right, well it didn’t happen then, and it won’t happen tomorrow or next year, the owners of the cow are still pulling the tit and getting milk, but she’s going dry pretty fast. There’s only so much hay in the barn to keep her going, and when the hay is gone and the neighbors hay is gone, and there’s no hay to steal from anyone, then old bossy will go dry and quit giving milk. But there’s still a lot of hay out there for the owners to steal to feed old bossy….

                “pantsuit nation”… The orchestrated never-Trump effort is my favorite not talked about political tool. We know that there’s a daily issued script as evidenced by the spontaneous new catch phrases but why hasn’t anyone cracked the network yet?

        Some 2,000 years ago, the Romans could have blamed their insanity on the latent effects of lead poisoning. Today, I suspect fluoride in the drinking water is responsible for much of the insanity in America. Here in Europe, where we don’t fluoridate our drinking water, I’m guessing insanity affects our elitist and ruling class because they have an inherited susceptibility to it.

            Bad thinking, very un-German of you. If Europeans don’t imbibe fluorides but are still insane, that means the fluorides are probably not the cause.
(Incidentally, the same goes for people who believe that GMOs are responsible for rising cancer rates and dropping sperm counts: GMOs are verboten in Europe, but the epidemic pattern is the same.)

        To me it’s an accelerated attempt by certain powerful elements to suppress the Heritage population. A Liberal candidate for Australia’s upcoming election has been cast out for criticising third-world settlement in her electorate and daring to mention how some Muslim women are treated by their co-religionists. This is the very “conservative” party which wonders why working-class whites aren’t rushing to the polls to vote for them. This woman would win in a landslide and the Prime Minister knows it. Still, she has to go and it is probably too late for her to nominate as an independent. It is no coincidence that none of the major parties, even the fringe weirdoes, are mentioning immigration. It is a massive issue whenever it is brought up but the politicians dismiss it as the ramblings of crazy people. The Liberal party have been told by those who pay their bills not to play that card and instead talk about child-care or Vegemite. It’s embarrassing to watch. I think this will be last of the Australian Kabuki elections, very soon someone will mention that the politicians are wearing no clothes.
