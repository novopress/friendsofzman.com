        I heard today there are 60000 Somalis in Columbus, Ohio and 150000 in Minneapolis. That’s 210000 people taking up space on the lifeboat that should be jettisoned back to their desert paradise. I can’t fathom what kind of imbecile would think this is good policy.

        I think most UK people recognise UKIP is a rearguard action, but it is all we have. Whatever they do (and most of us want them to ensure we are free of socialist, control-obsessed Europe, which incidentally is why the oft-promised referendum on the issue will never materialise: our politicians always want their greedy snouts in the Euro trough) they probably will fade into the background sooner or later.sadly, the damage here is done. We have become socialist whether we liked it or not, we are controlled and watched all the time and we are lied to smoothly and easily.Strange though it seems, a lot of Brits still want a successful and strong America. Maybe it’s because we had a hand in your creation (albeit a hand we didn’t really foresee) and you chose to speak English, which boosts our ego no end. Whether you can still be the strong, focussed nation you once were remains to be seen. Just don’t go down the road we did.

            A lot of Americans are looking at Canada thinking it is in our long term interest for them to succeed. our children and grandchildren need a place to flee. Maybe that’s what Brits think of America.

        I don’t know much about what Reagan did for the US though I am aware of how much Churchill, and Thatcher, did to assist Britain in time of dire need.Churchill’s immediate problem was obvious but Thatcher helped stem in the 80s what was a slide into left-wing sludge with endless dissent, strikes and irresponsible actions by those with other agendas and who who didn’t care about the nation. (The old UK joke was that the establishment-based paper The Times newspaper only cared about who ran the country, but the worker-communist rag The Daily Worker only cared that Russia should run the country)But both Churchill and Thatcher stemmed a decay. They got hated for it, sure, but that is the way of the shallow left.If Reagan was like that too then it occurs to me that every so often in a nation’s life a person comes along who, whatever their faults, halts the slide into barbarism and decay. Then the ‘leaders’ who come after slowly start doing all the old decay stuff again and the process of the slide resumes.Maybe on both sides of the Atlantic we are waiting for the next ‘arresting entity’ to stop the slide, but they don’t seem to be around at the moment.

            Reagan was to America what Thatcher was to the UK. He ushered in sound money, cleaned up the tax code, rebuilt the military and stop pretending the Soviets were winning. The result was a renewed confidence amongst Americans. The resulting technological revolution carried us through the Caligula years in the Bush Years.
There’s no Reagan waiting in the wings now. The UK has UKIP, but that looks like a rearguard action.

        I would not blame any hospital nurse who refused to care for a patient with Ebola.  Obama and the CDC Director keep saying the probability of catching the virus from a symptomatic patient is low, but they always avoid saying the obvious that if you DO catch the virus death is almost certain (at least 70% of Ebola victims die of the disease).  The important metric for all of us, but caretakers in particular, is: ROI = Probability of catching the disease from someone who’s contagious X Likelihood of dying if you do catch it.  (In other words, this Result of Infection is analogous to the ROI expected return from a financial investment.)   The first factor, in Obama World, may be small, but the second factor is HUGE and in the majority of cases IRREVERSIBLE:  you catch the virus, you die.
