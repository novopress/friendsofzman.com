        “A few years ago there was a great podcast on the history of Rome. It is still listed in iTunes. There’s a feedburner version too. I used to listen to it while working out. Very well done.”Mike Duncan; great podcaster. he’s currently doing a podcast series covering various historical revolutions. Started out with the English, then did the U.S. Now he’s currently in the middle of the French.Also, if you haven’t already, check out Dan Carlin’s Hardcore History podcast series on the fall of the Roman Republic (it’s behind a paywall now, but its worth it); if you want to get a gist of his style, download his currently available free stuff; he’s currently in the middle of a great series on WWI:http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/

        I’ve not read the Thorn Birds- but I love the Masters of Rome series- it begins with the marriage of Marius to Caesars aunt and goes down to the Battle of Actium.

I’ve never read the McCullough books. I recall The Thorn Birds miniseries thirty years ago, but that’s it. I think it had something to do with women fighting over a man.
A few years ago there was a great podcast on the history of Rome.It is still listed in iTunes.There’s a feedburnerversion too. I used to listen to it while working out. Very well done.

        It’s obvious to me that the recent revelations concerning Clinton Inc. are coming from her side of the aisle.  The Democrat wing of The Caste wants to lose in 2016.  The U.S. is going to need a warmonger for a couple of cycles, as well as someone to decimate the entitlement system.  The GOP is better poised to do this, while setting the stage for a Progressive to roll in in 2020 or 2024.  By then health care should be sufficiently wrecked (by design) to set the stage for an advocate of single-payer.

            Joseph K, I think there’s some Machiavellian scheming going on for sure. The party deep state knows it is the GOP’s turn. They also know there’s a good chance they will nominate Jeb Bush. That means the Democrats will have a shot to win the Senate back in 2018 and the White House in 2020. The Bush family is the gift that keeps on giving.

        Ha ha, that’s funny. If you think I’m “dismayed” about this, you obviously don’t know me at all.
Actually, you should read my book. I suspect there are fewer disagreements between you and me than you think.

I kid, I kid. I have your book on my reading list. Frankly, I’m flattered to have a classicist reading me.

        Not to mention that this could have caused far, far worse damage to national security than anything Snowden did.  Tens of thousands of emails, most probably secret, TS, or policy level being sent in theclear.  No wonder the CHICOMs, Russians, EU and everyone else has been running rings around us for the last six years.
And for the record, I do not believe that she will even receive a disapproving glance for this.

        Hilldabeast is a shrill pear who has worn poorly, and may be in very bad health. Or will be. I suspect that we project her future with more success than it deserves in relation to both the support she has from dreadful people and our loathing of her. Not dissimilar to Jeb Bush. Who also has no chance.I’m not sure why the misapplication and selective application of law will, as you say, not end well. It’s going rather swimmingly for the Progressives. As the country descends there are simply ever more Progressives required to manage it. They say democracies end not with a bang but a whimper, and whimps look like a good bet.

        Ironic that this “discovery” should coincide so neatly with the announcement of the Petraeus plea deal, which amounts to a slap on the wrist financially but which bars him from ever returning to public life.So much of interest here:  Many in the WH and State Dept. must have known of this “unique” arrangement and the reasons behind it.  Did any of them ever question it?  Alert the Justice Dept.?  If Justice knew, why did they not pursue?We will also discover much in the next few weeks, especially, as you allude in your post above, how determined the 0bama people will be to promote a successor.  If Justice has been taken over by the lunatic left, I might expect to see a certain quid pro quo emerge that is not too different from outright blackmail:  The Hildebeast will announce that she will not seek the nomination for “health reasons,” while Justice will scale back any probe of this matter.  On the other hand, if the Clintonistas want to go to the mattresses for this against the 0bama family, then we will see an investigation in earnest that will get very ugly indeed and have repercussions beyond those that either side anticipates.  To resort to your fondness for Roman analogies, think of it as a 21st century DC version of Sulla vs. Marius.

            Rules are for little people, and Republicans. Absolutely nothing will come of this.Maybe. The Left does not like Hillary. My read is they want an alternative, but one has yet to emerge. Butch O’Malley is angling for the role, but I don’t think he is the first choice. If Fake Indian starts telling people she will support Butch, then I think we might see the claws come out and Hillary in trouble over this. The Obama administration is not defending her which is what has me thinking she is not clear of this.But, your larger point is correct. The rule of law has been suspended.
