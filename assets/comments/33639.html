        Advocating a strong defense is a perennial “conservative” talking point. Unfortunately in practice the net result is corporate welfare for the Defense industry and permanent employment for thousands of government employees, civilian and otherwise. Those become the biggest advocacy group for continuing anted expanding programs, the self-licking ice cream cone as it were.As dissidents have often lamented, and Derb is probably one, our nation has been invaded by aliens, tens of millions of them. Some illegally, but many legal. I’m speaking, of course, of foreigners who move here, most of whom don’t have values remotely resembling traditional American values. Some assimilate. Most do not. Nor, I fear, ever shall they.Is that observation really hyperbole? I don’t think so. Our much-vaunted “Defense” did absolutely nothing to keep these hostiles outside our borders. Indeed, they probably increased the flow (due to our military adventurism causing refugees to come here.)Is America defeated? Sure looks like it. And it wasn’t because a foreign army stormed the castle walls. Quite the contrary, we lowered the drawbridge, raised the portcullis and invited them in, offering them room and board.

            And next thing you know, they’ll have those Defense jobs salted liberally throughout the States…and be voting for mayors that look like them, and not us.

        The author is exactly right:“We should have withdrawn from NATO back in 1991 after the Warsaw Pact folded up their tents.”
Let Europe defend itself. Since 1991, NATO has evolved from a purely defensive alliance into an offensive organization. It doesn’t defend Europe anymore. Its primary purpose now is to destroy Russia, for the benefit of the Jews.
Jews ruled Russia after the Bolshevik putsch in 1917. But no more. Now they hate Russia. Now they rule the EU. They have provoked war with Russia, using their patzies in Ukraine, the EU and the USA.

            I listened to clips of WWII German soldiers. When asked why they fought, they said, “We were fighting to keep Stalinist Bolshevism out of Germany, and out of Europe.”
When asked why they rounded up jews for the camps, they responded with puzzlement: “What? We were soldiers. If you treated civilians badly you were punished or sent to a penal detail. We didn’t round people up, we had nothing to do with Labor Allocation.”

                Most whites believe the biggest of the big lies.  For many, the big lie is their highest value.  When they must choose, they’ll even side with the chosen over their beloved blacks.

        19 years ago, I spent 4 or 5 months in South Africa. It had a lot of the same problems back then that it has today, rampant crime (on a level AINO denizens can’t really comprehend), rampant corruption, too many negroes, iffy public services. The murder of farmers was already epidemic back then, I heard all about it. Here in AINO, we all know someone whose house has been robbed. There in RSA (Republic of South Africa) you yourself have been robbed, you don’t just know someone who has, that’s the difference. The house I rented for a couple of months got robbed, while we were sleeping. And it wasn’t in “the hood,” my neighbors were millionaires. The problems with electric power and water were already beginning, worse now I gather. I was advised not to walk down perfectly safe looking streets, and heaven forbid at night. Carjackings were common, and crowds of feral negros hung around every city intersection, so you were never going to see that coming. And you couldn’t legally carry a gun to defend yourself. If you shot an intruder in your home (and sooner or later there was sure to be one), the burden was still on you to prove self defense, and if you couldn’t you were going to prison for murder.But in spite of all that and more, I still gave serious thought to retiring there, and once in a blue moon that thought still crosses my mind. Because it is paradise. A lovely, wonderful place. Friendly, festive people (when they’re not robbing you). A real camaraderie and community among the whites, the likes of which I’ve never seen in AINO. The weather, simply perfect. The scenery, gorgeous. So if I, an outsider, thought of it that way, and considered retiring there (but ultimately didn’t primarily because of the crime), then someone who has lived there all their life must feel an even stronger attachment, and be even more willing than I was to overlook the negative aspects. It really is a special place, and it’s so sad what has happened to it.

            I’ve read that the white South Africans would have Easter meals in which 100 family members and guests were routinely expected.  We are missing so much.

            Jeff, there is a criticism of white South Africans that they would rather be murdered in their beds than make their own beds, meaning that they are so addicted to black slave labor that they would rather be murdered by their black servants than be self-sufficient.
I don’t know. Did you see evidence of that?
This seems to be a corollary to USA conservatives that they would rather have their daughters raped by non-whites than be called racist, which is indubitably true.

                Could be. I had a zulu maid who cleaned my house for about $7 or $8 I think it was. But everything was cheap to me with the exchange rate as it was. Even better now, I hear. Some of the whites I knew were more race realist and some were limo liberals. Didn’t really see any woke white baizuo in the same sense that we see them in AINO in 2025. One of the race realists I knew, who happened to be a selou scout in the bush war, did very well for himself in construction, employing negros whom he paid next to nothing. Another was an Italian transplant, who had a similar arrangement with his import/export operation down at the port.

                    I’ve heard that Orania doesn’t hire white people. Workers are black. They can come. White seekers of a job in a white city cannot. They’re losers who can’t be mixed with.
I assume it’s true. That’s what a “whites only” place would be like if it were made in America. Ourde factoones are in fact like that, until they’re lost (mysteriously!). We’re all about the same.

                        Can you post a link for evidence of that?  Just a brief scan of first 30 or so links that come up when I search on Yandex claims all the gardeners and housekeepers and manual laborers in Orania are White.  I have heard that those White South Afrikans who moved to Australia/New Zealand continue the practice of relying/trusting solely black employees.  I don’t know/cannot find what % of White South African emigres are Afrikaans versus English, and whether there is a significant difference in their hiring practices.

                            There are no black laborers employed in Orania. They have a vocational school for training young Afrikaners. Their leaders characterize the former apartheid policies as a sham because they provided no real separation. During minority rule, Afrikaners constituted just over half the electorate.

                            Tiny anecdote, but a south african couple opened a medical place nearby and they seem to favor ethnic employees, in particular black. I got the impression they even imported a couple SA blacks for low level stuff.There’d be roughly 0 blacks in the area if not for this place.
I couldnt tell you if they were boer or english/”salties” though.

            You made the right decision. South Africa used to be good, when Whites were in charge. Now it’s a third-world shit-hole. Since 1994, it has been going steadily downhill, in spite of its tremendous natural resources. Why is that, I wonder?
It will soon end up likeZimbabwetoday. Zimbabwe used to be a prosperous, civilized country. That wasRhodesia. Now it’s likeHaiti, for the same reason.

        For a gripping account of Chixculub’s arrival, I must recommend Steven Baxter’sEvolution.The first half of the book is devoted to the Strike.
Unforgettable scenes include the fact that millions of tons of earth, lofted into the atmosphere, rained down like white-hot machine gun bullets. One scene was of a raptor looking at his brother in shock; he lifted his hands, and saw his fingers on fire.

        What was that? Ah…Munich, as in MU-nich.You see, I thought you’d said the Eunuch Security Conference.
I must admit I listen due to the sheer pleasure of crisp pronunciation, clear consonants, and glottal stops to make a Bushman proud. The fault was mine, as I tend to swoon a bit at the speaker’s innocently artless charm.

                Maybe I should have left it at “Eunuch Security Conference.”
I did, though, I did leave the show on without really hearing a word.  I find it to be as pleasant as hearing a babbling brook or nature sounds.  They ask, “why can’t the English speak English?”*, but I ask “why can’t Americans?”
*”It’s take, not tyke!”
