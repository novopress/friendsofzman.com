        If enough people start drawing the obvious logical conclusions, the virus could be the best thing that ever happened to us. In my neck of the woods, there are still a lot of Karens and soyboys wearing their masks everywhere ‚Äî such people are unavoidable, alas ‚Äî but for every one of them, there‚Äôs another one out playing with the kids, walking the dog, doing home improvement projects‚Ä¶ in short, getting out in the sunlight and acting like normal human beings, instead of consumer-bots and worker bees. And the no sportsball thing!! That has shocked me more than anything I‚Äôve ever seen. I thought for sure that the soccer moms and dads would be in open revolt long before now ‚Äî how are little Jayden, Kayden, and Brayden ever going to make the Majors if they can‚Äôt play on travel teams 365 days a year? But it isn‚Äôt happening. In fact, lots of people are cottoning to just how silly sportsball is. Best of all, the sportsballers themselves are contributing greatly to America‚Äôs case of Chronic Negro Fatigue, which is spreading far faster than corona. Oh, the NFL is going to give these multi-gazillionaires the option to sit the season out, at no penalty and for full salary, if theyfeeeeeelthat they, professional athletes in their 20s, are a health risk? Bless their hearts. Throw in the ‚Äúblack national anthem‚Äù at football games, ‚ÄúGod Bless America‚Äù in the 7th inning stretch instead of ‚ÄúTake Me Out to the Ballgame‚Äù (because hey, why not fuck with another tradition, just because?), etc., and there it is. If things break right, we could see the end of both pro sportsandthe university system here in the next decade. Thanks, corona!!!

Thanks, corona!!!If Universities are are short-sighted as Harvard ,who decided 50,000 a year is fine for University of Phoenix-level instruction, things may get pretty hilarious.Yes, I know Harvard sells credentials, not education.  My good Harvard friends have the most powerful raw intelligence I have ever seen but consistently have insane views due to a lackluster education.

                I know lots of people with Ivy League degrees (they‚Äôre everywhere in academia). They are, without exception, the most over-educated idiots I‚Äôve ever encountered. Like Orwell said, you have to be very smart indeed to believe the stupid things they do, but they‚Äôre up for the challenge. They think the Latin words on the diploma mean ‚ÄúCertified Sooper-Jenius.‚Äù If parents are still willing to put themselves in the poorhouse for that, after all this, then shine on you crazy diamonds. Better than spending it all on yet another Bentley like a rapper would.

                Traditional post-secondary education may be in the process of being destroyed by a form of educational ‚Äúinversion.‚Äù That is, increasingly anyone will be able to get a first-rate education online, and then pass tests to become ‚Äúcredentialed.‚Äù Thus, credentials will attach to the person rather than to an institution‚Äôs diploma, and at prices that are miniscule compared to today‚Äôs college racket.

                    Online learning is fine, but it takes a particular dedication and person.  It‚Äôs not for everyone.  But for those who are of the sort, it is better to take the tests and obtain the certification credentials, than spend excessive resources taking crap the Universities consider essential for a well rounded education.
However, outside of technology such as computer science and support of computing, what areas have been so automated?

            Town hall had an editorial about using this crisis to defund the universities. Add killing major league sportsball, and we might see a huge silver lining in this cloud that hangs over us all. The question I have is what happens to all of those folks formerly living the American dream that in reality were make work jobs? How their raft ends up once we‚Äôre through the Rapids could include a high % of the population.

                As to the jobs, I don‚Äôt know, but the university defunding is taking care of itself. All the junior colleges in my neck of the woods are taking to the airwaves, making sure everyone knows that their online Freshman 101 classes are fully transferable to all the State U‚Äôs. Since State U is threatening to make all its classes online anyway out of fear of Kung Flu, the only difference between State U and Local JuCo is that State U will charge you $20K more for the privilege. And that comes with a special bonus realization: Since both State U and Local JuCo agree that their classes are exactly the same, online and in person, then even if you can physically attend State U, you‚Äôre basically paying that extra $20K to drink beer in a dorm ‚Äî with all the virological consequences that entails ‚Äî and go to a few sportsball games. What a bargain, right?

                Don‚Äôt worry, they soon will be. What with the Supreme Court ruling that trannies are now a fully protected class under the Civil Rights Act, all athletic scholarships will soon enough go to biological men. That will rile up the feminists, and since no one in the ivory tower has ever won an argument with a feminist ‚Äîtrust meon this, they will grind your ass down to powder ‚Äî the only solution will be to eliminate all sports across the board.

                    The victim hierarchy is fun to monitor because it does shift.
It looks to me like blacks beat feminists because the feminists tried to shame the blacks for misogynist rap lyrics, but the blacks won decisively.
The trannies seem be rout the TERFs (Trans Exclusive Radical Feminists).
In any case, what great entertainment.

                        Yes but do trannies beat blacks? Tough call. My bet is with blacks. They have slavery and Jim Crow. Also, a lot of trannies are White.
Obviously, none of them beat Jews because all of this stuff is really just a Jewish smokescreen to destroy straight, gentile Whites.

                    And that will be gone soon enough, too. I still have lots of acquaintances in academia, so I‚Äôm semi-wired in to what‚Äôs going on at several colleges across the spectrum (JuCo to Big State to Small Liberal Arts College). I can assure you that eggheads are the Branch Covidians to end all Branch Covidians. Since these people sincerely believe that anyone to the right of Rachel Maddow is pushing pro-Trump propaganda (and lately they‚Äôre not so sure about even her), they believe that the horror stories the MSM are pushing are just the tip of the iceberg. They‚Äôre convinced, utterly convinced, that OMG we‚Äôre all gonna diiiiieeeee!!!eleventy any minute now. There have been faculty mutinies at several big schools already ‚Äì they‚Äôve categorically refused to report. Look for lots more colleges to go all-online here soon‚Ä¶ after which their revenue collapses, after which sports are gone, after which‚Ä¶ yeah. Good times!!!

                Not original to me, alas. I have no idea where I first heard it, but it sums up the situation perfectly. They‚Äôve spent the better part of 50 years making themselves obnoxious to everyone and everything. I think even now most people would be willing to leave them alone if they‚Äôd just leave us alone, but since they define themselves by obnoxious opposition to ambient civilization‚Ä¶.

                Please, Jeebus, make it so!! There is no bigger scam in this world ‚Äî no bigger scam in the history of the human race ‚Äî than ‚Äúeducation.‚Äù High school diplomas are worthless, since they let you re-take the test until you pass now (seriously ‚Äì how else can we be sure No Child is Left Behind?). Thus, college diplomas are worthless ‚Äî I myself have handed out As for work that would barely rate D- back when I was in college‚Ä¶ or in high school, for that matter, because what can you do? Asking a modern college ‚Äústudent‚Äù to write three clear sentences that, taken together, make a logical argument is akin to asking your dog to factor quadratics ‚Äî not only can‚Äôt he do it, he can‚Äôt even understand what it is you want him to do. (I retired some years ago, lest you think this is a new problem). ‚ÄúEducation‚Äù as it now is exists by Karen, for Karen ‚Äî it‚Äôs state-subsidized scolding, nothing more. More than a few parents have already realized this. Like the sportsballers, let those fucking parasites moan and groan until they starve. It won‚Äôt take much at all.

                    Schools in Virginia are opening. But if your kid wants to go to school, they can only go two days a week. The other days, they‚Äôre on their own. They have to wear a mask and googles (I think). They will eat lunch at their desk. No group projects.
If you go the virtual route, the kid gets four days of Zoom classes with the teacher.
The fact that this is brutal to marginal students doesn‚Äôt seem to bother the Karens.

        Another well written piece.  I‚Äôm currently working from home, so to speak, and I often find myself wondering how f‚Äôd up everything is and how we got here.

            Slightly OT but: I wonder about the long-standing popular fear of bats. They certainly do carry some nasty diseases. Most likely, including the current pandemic, probably with a stop in a Chinese lab along the way‚Ä¶ Some bat scientists have literally gone ‚Äúbat shit,‚Äù dying from virulent disease shortly after being exposed to bat feces. Also there are cases of workers dying soon after shoveling wild bat poop. With reports that COVID-19 can cause brain problems, it may lend even more weight to the term ‚Äúbat shit crazy‚Äù üôÅ

                The largest repository of rabies resides in the bat population.  That being said, I had a number of them living in my old house under the porch.  No a big deal, but sometime later they found a small opening into the wall, then into the house, and one night we had bats flying in the dark in the bedroom.  Turned the lights on and hilarity occurred.  üôÅ Wife was very unhappy, but dog (Terrier) loved it.  Damn quick killer.

            As I pointed out in my comment, I suspect that many of the jobs not being done just aren‚Äôt that productive or necessary. There‚Äôs no way you could remove 30 million workers who were producing necessary goods and services and not have a noticeable impact on the economy and all of our lives. Dollars don‚Äôt produce necessary goods and services. Workers do.
The fact that borrowing and printing dollars has kept the economy afloat shows that those workers weren‚Äôt adding much.

                    Yes, tend to agree. People, I think vastly over-estimate the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù or the ‚Äúneed‚Äù for all sorts of service jobs and industries. Pessimistically, the corollary is also true: a lot fo the workers really didn‚Äôt offer much of unique value. I‚Äôm not saying that these industries didn‚Äôt contribute something to the economy, at least wages to their workers, but the fact is a huge number of stores, goods, services and the attendant jobs are pretty frivolous and provided things that most people could easily provide for themselves. A lot of those jobs probably are not ever coming back. Better learn to trim your own hair with scissors and a mirror üôÇ

Don‚Äôt want to wear a mask and be around all the estrogen. I‚Äôve been doing my own nails and hair. We put our gym memberships on hold (won‚Äôt work out in masks and gloves).  Our ‚Äòservice economy‚Äô was mostly make-work, and most women‚Äôs jobs consisted of being professional gossips and karens.

                Probably also tells you that most if not ALL of the immigration we‚Äôve had into this country over last few decades ‚Äì was completely unnecessary for ‚Äúeconomic‚Äù reasons.When I was a kid ‚Äì kids used to take care of most of those low end jobs that you now see immigrant types in. White kids worked at McDonalds.  White kids worked on roofing crews.  White kids hauled concrete forms at construction sites.  White kids did unskilled labor in factories.  White kids worked on the farms.If you worked even halfway hard ‚Äì you could be doing ‚Äúblue collar‚Äù type labor as a teen and early 20-something and make enough money to put yourself thru school.  I know I did it ‚Äì and I know others who did it as well.  Rich kids might spend their summers working at restaurants in resort areas ‚Äì where they could make ‚Äúcontacts‚Äù ‚Äì or maybe they‚Äôd intern at daddy‚Äôs corporation so they could be into the young executive track when they got out of school.It was still like that back in the early 80s ‚Äì by probably the 90s it was already starting to disappear and the immigrants were taking over the lower end jobs.

                        Joggers for the most part are ill equipped to take jobs.  Seen this personally in my lifetime.Way back when, I needed a summer job as I was working myself through school.  Even went to car washes.  Money is money.  Went to a large production factory and spoke with the plant manager (he ran the show).  He said he just hired 3 ‚Äúinner city youths‚Äù who were part of a city program for the disadvantaged youth‚Äîread juvi-court diversions.  So he ‚Äúpulled my coat‚Äù and gave me this advice, ‚ÄúBe at the loading dock tomorrow morning, ready for work, and tell so and so, the foreman, you need a job. Odds are one or more of these guys won‚Äôt show.‚ÄùGuess what?  The next day 1 jogger shows up (out of three hired) and I immediately got the job.  The jogger lasted a week and then never showed up again.  I worked the whole summer, and they hire no more joggers while I was there.  By the way, the foreman was Hispanic and so were half the workers, but no joggers.

                            Putting traditional manual labor and jogger together is a stretch, unless of course you‚Äôre talking about armed robbery, house b&amp;e, rape, murder ‚Äì the usual run of the mill jogger stuff.

                    Wetbacks aren‚Äôt the only thing sucking up local employment. Kill the big box stores. Most of their garbage is made overseas or from far away. They kill local production, local business and local employment.If you‚Äôre relocating to rural areas try to pick up farm work if you‚Äôre job hunting. The more people that do this the less need they will have to use imported labor.  The agribusiness sector is still large but most of the labor is now brown.  Apply with 3 or 4 compatriots and see what happens.  If you need to you can press the issue.  Make rural America White again.Getting pushy in asserting our right to a piece of the pie is a good way to advance our interests without having to play the WNist angle. Doing so in rural areas will be easier than in more populous areas.

                I‚Äôm convinced there are an incredible number of grey and white collar jobs that are nothing more than BS paper-pushing that add no real economic value. In fact, these jobs may be so useless that they act as an net economic drag.
There are also a huge number of jobs that are no-show positions that create the same problems.

            It‚Äôs true that many millions of jobs are make work, and as long as essential services and the building trades are fully operational, then the larger society functions.Unfortunately, our betters have decided that a significantly reduced, and completely demoralized, police force is a winning strategy in large urban areas, as well as a form of UBI, to keep many millions on the welfare teat for as long as possible.The last two factors are a recipe for disaster, but I think the Bond villains behind our own Color Revolution want it that way.

            Also I have a hunch that most of that 30 million are immigrants or children of, and worked at menial jobs at low pay at large companies. When their job ended, they go on unemployment or get support from their families. This is easier for immigrants who tend to have large, supportive families. So these people can be removed en masse from the economy without much pain. Even if they lose unemployment, they do have other safety nets. Problems will occur when educated or middle-class people start losing their jobs, and can‚Äôt pay their massive debts.

                I think we unfairly discount native American talent. The fact is, it takes a lot of odd jobs to accumulate enough capital to start a small business nowadays. Today‚Äôs budding businessman needs to save enough for the inital 9mm, some clips and ammo, inital product and packaging, pay off the local cops, etc. It‚Äôs a tough world out there üôÇ

            Good luck, ammo is getting tough to come by. I bought some 9mm this morning and only got it because I was watching like a hawk, and most of it sold out and was unavailable within ten minutes of my order confirmation. We all need to allocate a percentage of our day to replenishing our stock of freedom seeds.

                Good advice. I don‚Äôt think it will start with outright confiscation, though. My guess is the ammunition and new firearms supply will dry up as a moratorium is placed on new production, and after a bit of attrition the move will be toward gradual seizures.Incidentally, I saw first-hand what happened in Australia after Port Arthur in 1996. Per usual, do not believe anything in the propaganda outlets. More or less the St. George strategy was used, and many teary Aussies willingly gave up their arms. The propaganda was remarkably similar to that surrounding the recent American race riots. Most  Aussies still did not surrender their guns, though, and after a very brief moratorium on new sales, the confiscations started and were such gross violations of civil liberties that the propaganda outlets either ignored what happened or demonized those who were terrorized. In the State of Victoria, for example, police literally kicked in doors in the middle of the night and searched large areas home by home, even in Melbourne, which is a huge city. Anyone who witnessed that would have no illusions about what is planned for White America.The sparse population in Australia, coupled with most citizens clustered in densely populated coastal areas, did not necessitate a lengthy moratorium prior to the seizures. That is one advantage the United States has. My concern is that the religious shaming will work here even more so than it did initially there. The kneeling and groveling over St. Floyd has put a sense of dread into me.That happened only 24 years ago, and today most Australian Millennials and almost no Zoomers realize how widespread firearms ownership once was there. They talk about American gun ownership as if it is something that the world never experienced. If memory serves a higher percentage of Aussie homes prior to ‚Äô96 had firearms than is the case in the United States. Older people still remain shaken about what the government did. From time to time a politician down there will suggest legalizing guns again, and the propaganda outlets target that person for destruction, often with great success.

                    The tactic that California used to shut down gun stores was to require a background check for each purchase of ammo.
The only gun store/range in my county threw in the towel when that passed around 2016. The owner told me that the ammo background check was simply too onerous and was the last straw.
After that, there was nowhere to shoot or buy ammo in my county. (That‚Äôs one of the hundreds of reasons that I left CA.)

            Not just ammo is scarce ‚Äì rifles and pistols, too. Was talking with a retail dealer the other day and he pointed out that the manufacturers are completely tapped out. Everyone is on allocation. Their pistol display case was shockingly empty. I signed up for a manufacturer email notice when the product was back in stock; I got the notice and purchased immediately. I checked back 16 hours later &amp; they were out of stock again.I have no idea how it is that no White guy has started shooting up a demonstration. Is it that the seriousness of the situation has brought sanity even to the most unhinged?

                nobody should shoot anybody if there is any possible way to avoid it. you most of the porotests have a theatrical quality to them with some fights but no actual killing on either side. there are a few outliers like the woman hit by the african american man‚Äôs car in seattle .which I think is more of an accident than deliberate.

        Canada has now spent as much money on the pandemic, as it spent fighting the second world war.
Economies fail slowly to start, and then all at once. The financial hair cuts and bank holidays are on the way, make no mistake.

                Yep ‚Äì definitely already creeping in.I have been watching online equipment and bankruptcy auctions for a while.  I pickup good deals on equipment to fill out my shop that way, as well as things like milsurp generators and vehicles.Judging by the amount of auctions I see for companies that supply the oil and gas industry with pipes and processing equipment ‚Äì I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre hurting ‚Ä¶. a lot.I also see quite a few large auto parts manufacturing facilities showing up , as well as lots of smaller machine shops and so forth.  LOTS of restaurants and food production facilities as well.I see reports that Boeing is hurting big-time as well.  They really screwed themselves with their timing on putting out a crappy product with that 737-Max fiasco.

                Lots of businesses are giving haircuts to senior employees, at least.  Law firms and accounting firms have cut partners draw 25% and associates pay 10-15%.  And that was with PPP. I expect things to get worse after the election.  That‚Äôs when we hit calm waters before we go over the progressive waterfalls. (Even if Trump wins).

            It does feel like we‚Äôre in a calm before the storm phase. While most people don‚Äôt think more than a few months in the future, I‚Äôve pressed them on the calamity of what we‚Äôve done and they can at least agree it‚Äôs unprecedented.Whats most concerning to me is the fact that our leadership seems to be in a trance. Mindlessly issuing new restrictions on social and economic activity. The governor of NJ just mandated masks outside yesterday! Texas has closed establishments that get more than 50% of their revenue from liquor.Its like they can‚Äôt think through what will come of this. Everyone is banking on a fed bailout, but what if it never comes? Will leadership of these places be held responsible or will the media be able to convince everyone that it‚Äôs those stingy republicans refusing to pass a $20 trillion bailout package? Will the DNC gain power and pass a bailout package so large that it causes the dollar to become useless overnight?Strange times indeed.

                    I think there are a couple factors behind that. They know that old people vote, and they know that they can only get away with so much voter fraud.
Thus, they are going to peddle anything they think that old people will like, such as mandatory masks outside.

                            ‚Ä¶system crashing down‚Ä¶A decision matrix is mandatory now to gauge how likely you are to get pulled down with that System (physically, financially, work, food, housing). Removing yourself from it, and your ongoing investment in it‚Äôs existence, as much as possible, is key.Observing the masses paying down debt is not surprising. Most people  see more clearly the noose tied to the millstone that is their indebtedness. Rejecting debt slavery, and it‚Äôs control of you, is easier when you are not distracted by the mythical modern life you‚Äôve been fooled into living.

                                This is the point where people either cut back and prepare for real, or simply carry on and hope for the best. Both are coping strategies, and either one gets you from where we are now, to wherever it is that we are going. People are quite adaptable, to a point. After that, all bets are off, and prepping versus hoping becomes a huge factor. We aren‚Äôt to that point yet, and may actually be far off from it. The de facto UBI mentioned by Vizzini below, as well as the systemic fat that can be burned through, suggest a long intermediate ‚Äúhang fire‚Äù phase.

                                    Dutch, ‚ÄúSystemic Fat‚Äù has been proven true by virtue of the Make Work drones not working, and the lack of structural effect on the economy (for now). But what of the physical / safety aspect of our society?The Hang Fire phase makes sense to me economically and business-structure wise, but the physical danger we are all now exposed to is a new variable to me. Not that I had not considered it but it was way down the list of concerns. Proximity to the concentration of dindu‚Äôs is now a major concern. Roving mobs are one thing, but most grocery store and gas trucks have to come through their ‚Äòhood. Bracken‚Äôs outline of what happens to those trucks early-phase of breakdown concerns me greatly.

                                Yeah but ‚Äì I think prior to maybe 4 months ago ‚Äì most people never really considered the fact that ‚Äúsystem crashing down‚Äù would include enraged mobs of diversity coming to their own house ‚Äì and burning the place down with them inside ‚Äì all the while yelling ‚Äúracist!‚Äù as you tried to evacuate your wife and kids thru the side door.Most of the prepper types I know ‚Äì even in the most extreme cases ‚Ä¶. might move away to a more rural location , but that‚Äôs often so they can grow a garden and stay away from ‚Äúcities‚Äù .  I don‚Äôt they really considered the way things have been going since the BLM riots started.I think most prepper types centered their ‚Äúsystem going down‚Äù thinking around having enough to eat ‚Äì and maybe being in a more sustainable physical location. I don‚Äôt think they really considered society going all Red China Cultural Revolution on their asses.

                                    Carlsdad, beyond Maslow‚Äôs basics (to paraphrase food, water, shelter, physical security) I‚Äôve now added Community to the reason to retreat to rural areas.Weathering implosion of the modern world is made easier with community. I‚Äôve looked around my AO (mid-size, southern city) for my people, discreetly, for 3 years. If those men are here, they don‚Äôt want to be found. So we are withdrawing our contribution to this community for greener pastures. And even if they are not much greener community-wise, a little land far from little Africa is a win for my family.

                                I‚Äôve already done this.  Unfortunately my matrix has mostly zeros in it.  Stuck in a small, overpriced apartment, shitty job and was in the middle of attempting a career change when 2020 hit, food is all from the store, my patio garden will never supply more than a few herbs, water is city water supply.  We‚Äôre not as fucked as Manhattanites but close to it.  The upside here is that it‚Äôs a low density suburb around here with only ‚Äúgood‚Äù diversity and I‚Äôve got a good car to escape in.  My wife and I are cheaper than Jews too so we‚Äôre building up some savings (assuming the dollar doesn‚Äôt collapse).  If bugout becomes necessary though we‚Äôre basically just (well armed) hobos sleeping in our car.  Lots of people won‚Äôt even get that far though so I always keep in mind ‚Äì it can always get worse.

Rather, it is a swarming ensemble of hobgoblins and demons conjured by elite demiurges who have overestimated their own power.

                                Tarstarkas.I agree with your statement at face value. Since power comes from the end of the gun, how does the sheer volume of private ownership play into this strange new world we find ourselves in?I believe there will be a fight. So a crash suggests, to me anyway, that they will eat many of their own, thereby reducing their number of troops I (or my progeny) will have to deal with.That‚Äôs a good thing IMO. Allowing them to strengthen their current position while sucking life and wealth out of the productive of us seems like a terrible play.

                                    I hate to oversimplify things but power is basically really 2 things ‚Äì arms and organization.  The elite knows we have the former, this is why they try so hard to keep us from attaining the latter.People have been talking a lot about 1968 here lately.  The same* scum caused the problems back in 68.  Back then, though, there was no increasingly totalitarian framework of ‚Äúsoft power‚Äù to keep people like us from meeting openly and even discussing ‚Äúself defense options‚Äù.  Events like the Spanish Civil War and of course, the rise of the NSDAP were still fairly recent then.  The elite could see that the Left‚Äôs ‚Äúshock troops‚Äù, groups like the Weathermen, Black Panthers,the Balto Cong**, etc‚Ä¶ would be wiped out in days if they went up against the white mainstream.  When the radicals started to lose out to more respectable subversives like MLK, it was obvious that it made sense to go back to using more of a boil the frog slowly approach.Our Thing has gotten big enough now and is starting to put more emphasis on becoming a real counter-culture with our own business and social networks.  The hippies were actually trying to do this themselves at the end of the 1960s of course.  While the Weathermen wanted to blow up the Establishment, they wanted to walk away from it.  They failed for a lot of reasons that don‚Äôt affect us though.  The main factors being aimless hedonism, drugs, implicit feminism, incompetence, and no understanding of economics.  We also have lots of new technologies for small scale production that didn‚Äôt exist in the 60s.  If we can make our break with the system and develop our own communities and ways of life, we have the skeleton of organization.  Combined with arms and the natural skills of a lot of our people this could be the framework of a new state or states as their‚Äôs falls apart.  This possibility must terrify them.I don‚Äôt think the time for open conflict is here now and ideally can be put off until the system is so weak and rotten that most of it falls apart on its own.  This is happening at speed though now.  It‚Äôs really something to watch the Left tear itself apart* I just watched a video of some old commie woman on trial for trespassing on behalf of some Lefty cause in Idaho.  She talked about her former arrest in the 60s at a similar event.  Sometimes the original 60s jerkoffs are still making trouble today, sometimes it‚Äôs their grandkids.** The Balto Cong, an almost forgotten and hilariously incompetent Maoist gang that terrorized my home town briefly in the 60s until they ran out of fingerpaint and LSD.

                    We have been experiencing ongoing bailouts as far as the eye can see.  The Biden difference is that the future bailouts will have an additional cost, which is the demand for an overt personal celebration of government‚Äôs intrusion and takeover through the various bailout strategies.  Anyone participating in any way in them, will have a feminine-style personal shit-test placed on them as an essential part of the process.

                One lesson people should be taking from the events of the last 5 months is that the rules are not static, objective and unchanging natural forces. But rather they are arbitrary and can change on a dime.  So far, 2020 has been the year of the unthinkable and there are 6 more months left. Whatever bad scenario you can envision, do yourself a favor and remember that the rulers make the rules and can change them or not enforce them or selectively enforce them at their pleasure.  The rules are not for you. You OBEY the  rules, they make them. They exist to assist them. Once the current arrangement no longer benefits them, they will change the rules.

                    The rulers make many rules but there are some aspects they cannot control. Namely, underlying reality itself.
Money is a store of value, how long can we continue to provide value to 30% or more of the population who is contributing nothing to the common wallet? How long can we attack those individuals who are providing the actual value for our world? The farmer, the machinist, the tradesmen?
I have a growing fear that nothing but the underlying reality of the world will stop our leadership from attempting to create utopia.

That Video just confirms what I said above. The world is lousy with Chinese spies and collaborators. And as far as China looking to solve some of their internal problems, that won‚Äôt dissuade them from their imperialist aspirations.

            If there is a mass wave of evictions, an American version of Mad Max, the first movie though, not the sequels.I have no idea how we will deal with this slow rolling crisis especially with many of those people having nowhere to go, being paranoid and well armed.The only way around this is to put an  end to the shutdowns by fiat and to hand out another 6 months of unemployment but this will not fix anything, only stabilize it at a lower level.Late Stage Capitalism had to go for a real fix but while the Left as often is good at diagnostics, the proposed solutions are stupid.

Indefinitely, or so it seems.

                    Over 1/3 of the economy is government spending.  A good chunk of that is make-work.  There is no way this 1/3 is not imposing additional costs in the private sector. Complying with regulation is a not insignificant portion of business spending.

                        Yeah its nearly 40% of the GDP.However most of this bloat is caused by the efficiency trap.We simply don‚Äôt need at least half, maybe more of all workers and without money from jobs, we get no consumers and no future consumers except through 3rd world immigrationNote within a generation, they stop having kids too. Latino TFR is where White TFR was in the 80‚Äôs (1.8 or so)Unless you basically eliminate economies of scale and tightly control automation, jobs are gone.We are right now in a position where you can work from home, order nearly everything you want delivered even a car and have all your entertainement piped in.

            Sooner or later all the money printing is going to screw something up.  If I had to take a wild guess as to what might be happening ‚Ä¶.. I‚Äôd say that a lot of young people probably dumped their apartments and moved back home with their parents.  If they still have a job ‚Äì maybe they‚Äôre now working from home, and have plenty of extra  money left over which they use to pay down their credit cards.  That would explain both of the things that Zman noted.I know of at least 3 cases for 20 somethings where this exact thing has happened ‚Äì and these were all ‚Äúkids‚Äù who kept their jobs.  They dumped the apartments ‚Äì and moved home. Didn‚Äôt seem to make any sense to be locked down in the apartment paying rent ‚Äì when they could do it at their parent‚Äôs house for cheaper.  For young women especially ‚Äì I‚Äôd be willing to bet that being locked down frees up all sorts of cash,  no more need for shopping sprees,  club fees and alchoholic drink buying on Thursday and Friday nights ‚Äì or pregnancy tests. Now ‚Äì suddenly there‚Äôs a bunch of free cash to pay down the credit cards.Martin Armstrong has been following this stuff for a while ‚Äì and he claims that what is going on is that the whole socialistic enterprise that is the West ‚Äì has reached the point where the money has dried up (we‚Äôve reached that point in time that Thatcher talked about).  So the power elites are crapping themselves because the old way of high taxation PLUS a lot of money printing ‚Äì has reached an end.Europe is already fishing around in everybody‚Äôs couch cushions for money ‚Äì and the lockdown from Europeans traveling to the US is as much about keeping them from getting assets out of the Euro-zone ‚Äì as it is about any sort of virus mitigation.The talk about going to a digital currency and cancelling paper ‚Äì is also all about taxation.  When every single cent you have is trackable ‚Äì the government is going to get it‚Äôs cut whether you want them to ‚Äì or not.  So first comes the digital currency ‚Äì and next comes the 400% rise in taxes that is now being discussed.As far as the whole ‚Äù I don‚Äôt see anything bad happening outside my window‚Äù crowd ‚Äì well I can say to that is:  The soldiers on the Atlantic Wall enjoyed some pretty nice duty for  years ‚Äì while their brothers on the Eastern Front were getting the shit kicked out of them and dying in the frozen wastes of Russia.Then suddenly one morning out of the mist ‚Äì a whole bunch of ships appeared‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.  and that little vacation was OVER.

                I agree that ‚Äúsooner or later all the money printing is going to screw something up,‚Äù but what has been so amazing and educational is how long an economy that is untethered from reality can prosper.
It may be that as long as the USA has a relatively productive economy, the biggest military, and is the world‚Äôs reserve currency, that the USA can continue to defy economic reality past the point that we are all dead.  Who knew?

                    I‚Äôve long marveled at the US economy‚Äôs seemingly unique ability to float its massive bulk in the sky.Ultimately it‚Äôs the question of ‚Äúwhere does Becky her money to spend at da club?‚Äù  She has a job (still).  What does she do though?  Well, before the Beer Flu she went to meetings a lot where she and Rachel, Jessica, and Jennifer would discuss matters of great import to the large company they worked for ‚Äì things like racial justice, the environment, the need to welcome immigrants, the need for more cultural sensitivity, removing ‚Äúgendered‚Äù language from the texton the company‚Äôs website(a lot of it written more than 10 years ago by evil white men).  Oh, she also had ‚Äúreal work‚Äù to do.  There was stuff like writing reports and PowerPoints full of grammatical errors and basic logical fallacies or maybe spreadsheets where bogus data is run through incorrect formulas.  There was going to conferences and meetings in faraway cities (Partaaaayh!), and of course socializing at the water cooler with all the other girls and maybe Mike, the one guy on the floor, who does some sort of ‚Äúengineer stuff‚Äù and screams ‚Äúbeta bucks‚Äù.What does she do now?  ‚Äî exactly the same stuff but now at home through Zoom.  Of course the conferences in Vegas are cancelled now ‚Äì bummer!  She still sees that electronic deposit every two weeks though.  Where does the company get that money to pay her?  Ultimately from big banks that invest in it.  They get theirs from the central bank, which ultimately gets its money from‚Ä¶ God.Well not really but close enough.  In this case God is the endless world demand for the dollar and the understanding that this dollar is ultimately backed by the US and its fancy Area 51 weapons.  This also answers the question of why Becky‚Äôs funny money is actually worth anything at all and can buy things of actual value like electricity, gasoline, food, electronics, almost all of it made outside the US by people who ‚Äúneed‚Äù dollars or by the remaining US dirt people in flyover country.The real question of course is why does Becky‚Äôs company bother paying Becky at all?  They probably makesomethinguseful after all.  That‚Äôs why they hired Mike.  Why not just pay him and cut off the Becky‚Äôs?  In this case it‚Äôs that corporations have reached an agreement with the State, the various racial and gender mobs, and the Media that they will continue paying Becky as long as their investors pay them.  Their investors pay them because they ultimately get their money from the central bank whose dollars are needed by all those people in China and elsewhere who still make useful things.  This is all ultimately in the name of social stability.  Essentially, the idea is to keep Becky off the street given that she‚Äôs no longer willing to marry Mike (at least not until she‚Äôs 40 and all partied out).The system is now using Beer Flu as a way to find a new equilibrium.  Becky now does her nonsense at home and still gets paid, companies save money on office space, airline tickets, and lots of other stuff.  Besides, a lot of those expensive offices were in places likely to be Burn-Loot-Murdered.  The people who really got screwed were the ones outside this whole framework ‚Äì basically small privately held manufacturers, family restaurants, and independent contractors.  There‚Äôs a plan for them too, that‚Äôs where Trump bucks come in to keep them afloat if not happy.  The end result is that more people are forced into the economy controlled by the government and big companies or are just forced onto the dole forever.  The system is now more centralized and easier to control.  The savings from office space and all that other stuff go directly into the pockets of the elite.  At least this is the plan as I see it.  It remains to be seen if they can pull it off and get away with it.The weakest link is probably, ironically, the US war machine‚Äôs continued ability to intimidate the world into buying US dollars.  War machines arise from nations, not corporations, not abstract Equalist ideological fantasy, not the latest fashionable sexual degeneracy.  The US‚Äôs elite has done everything it can to destroy what remained of the historic US nation and corrupt its military.  The damage it has done to the nation‚Äôs ability to maintain basic law and order also calls into question its credibility in projecting power globally.  Right now American forces abroad are probably close to finding themselves in the position of those ancient emperors and generals who marched off to conquer distant lands and found their capital cities burned and overrun when they got back.

                I have hearing about the consequences of money printing being just around the corner for all of my life. While the cumulative effect of the money printing has taken a good deal of our income and wealth, the highest periods of inflation were tame and relatively short lived.  The ECB and the BOJ have been printing money like it‚Äôs going out of style for a long time, especially the BOJ.  Japan doesn‚Äôt have the reserve currency either.A lot of the Peter Schiff types think this all happens in a vacuum. It doesn‚Äôt. The central banks collude with each other and control many of the rules.  Of course, the rules are subject to change without notice. That includes the law.  Fifty years of the sky is just about to fall does nothing to curb their enthusiasm that the sky falling is right around the corner.  Assuming they are ever proven right, it will be by accident.

                    That‚Äôs because the money was more evenly distributed so it found its way into rising prices of consumer goods.
now the money is heavily concentrated at the top so it finds its way into things that wealthy people spend money on, namely houses, the markets, luxury goods, etc.  prices of luxury homes, goods, and things like yachts are through the roof
if the average Joe received more of that new money, you can bet the inflation would be insane, speaking of inflation in the technical academic sense of the basket of goods utilized to estimate CPI

                    Looks like Justin Haskins is reading Martin Armstrong. Armstrong issue a pay-for report a couple of weeks back titled ‚ÄúThe Great Reset‚Äù ‚Äì which talked about the exact same things that Haskins is talking about in his article.I have the report ‚Äì just haven‚Äôt had the chance to read thru more than the 1st ten pages or so.Long story short:  The virus is just a mask for machinations behind the scenes ‚Äì and the global warming crowd ‚Äì which if you remember has been screaming about ‚Äù we only have 12 years!‚Äù for a couple of years now‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. is trying to destroy the carbon based economy in favor of ‚Äúrenewables‚Äù.  You can also add in people like Bill Gates and the Malthusian crowd as players as they try to force in some sort of population control agenda. On top of all of that ‚Äì is the fact that socialism is dying ‚Äì and the power structure has been riding that horse for over a decade ‚Äì and doesn‚Äôt want to give up power.  So they‚Äôll stripe mine everything trying to keep the larger financial game that keeps them in power going for as long as they can.There‚Äôs a bit of an intelligence test going on here.  What I mean by that is ‚Äì when  you see people say stupid shit like ‚Äù I will just hide my assets in Bitcoin!‚Äù or‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. ‚Äù I don‚Äôt see what the problem is with eliminating cash‚Äù ‚Äì you should understand that you‚Äôre staring directly at a person who is likely a moron.As somebody said a long time ago: ‚ÄúIn politics nothing happens by accident‚Äù

                Short of a true 1984 type surveilance state, I doubt they will ever completely abolish ‚Äúcash‚Äù or at least a barter black market. Inefficient yes, but there will always be a need to buy goods and services in quantities not approved of by The Planners, or unapproved by them at all. And for that there‚Äôs cash, or more likely, an obsolete form of it when it was made of a precious metal.

            The unemployment  and other programs stop at the end of this month which means the US will undergo a complete collapse by the end of the year.No wonder people are paying down debtsHyperinflation requires both a currency crisis and as CSC noted money to have velocity.The currency crisis won‚Äôt happen unless the US implodes simply because there are no other options to dollars, Yen, , Euros and Rubles all fall short and while the Yuan might seem like a good idea, China is not in as good a shape as they want you to think.As for velocity, there are few children being born so that is a weak sector and too much of the service/entertainment economy is still locked down or just unpleasant to use.The real risk, I mean beyond the obvious collapse is that the reaction to this plague may have taken consumerism out behind the proverbial chemical shed and shot it.Its quite possible that even if society opens up fully no masks son everyone has gone to survivalist mode and that most spending is now going to be beans, bullet and band aids which doesn‚Äôt make for much of an economy.

            In a credit money economy like ours money printing is inflationary but debt destruction is deflationary. We are experiencing massive debt destruction right now through bankruptcies and debt discharge. As long as money printing does not vastly exceed debt destruction there will be no broad-based inflation, because the money supply remains approximately constant.

        I was in a pawn shop yesterday filling out paperwork on a Benelli Vinci tactical semi-auto I had to buy online from out of state because nothing available in LA, a asked the owner if people were talking loans during all this madness. He said on the contrary, their paying off loans with the government cheese. So far my personal canoe is holding up. About 3 years ago I switched from a global vertical transportation company to a local mom and pop shop that specializes in residential properties. That‚Äôs worked out so far. Have to keep all the Amazon junkies supplied no matter what. And most of them couldn‚Äôt find a staircase if the building was burning down. My Jewish sister-in-law insists on giving me Amazon gift cards even though I tell her i don‚Äôt use them. Last year I mentioned that I‚Äôve been donating the to the PLO. That put an end to that. Zman mentioned lacrosse today. Long stick midi here.

            About 3 years ago I switched from a global vertical transportation company to a local mom and pop shop that specializes in residential properties.
What‚Äôs a vertical transportation company and what does it have to do with residential properties?

        As everyone else has noted, guvmint checks go a long way but it‚Äôs more like a big hairball the cat can‚Äôt spit up quite yet.I‚Äôve mentioned it before but:1) Courts: total lockdown.  Meaning no enforcement on civil matters.2) Forebearance: we‚Äôre not going to foreclose but we‚Äôre going to re-write your contract.3) Evictions: again, no enforcement.In the commercial real estate space, I‚Äôve got friends who look like they‚Äôve just been blasted with a 12 gauge.  They know how effed the space is going to be for years to come if the government doesn‚Äôt put a mighty big thumb on the scales.  How do you lease out office space in a post COVID age?  What employer is going to make his millennial snowflake work force show up in the office when a single sneeze could bestow them with bat AIDS?  They‚Äôre not going to and oh by the way it looks great on the budget to stop paying obscene rents‚Ä¶.As Zman says, we‚Äôre in the middle of the river still‚Ä¶the shoreline is not even in sight.

        I was wondering just this very thing the other evening. I had been quite sure of some form of economic discomfort, but evidently it has not arrived‚Ä¶ Certainly not in the UK, anyhow. Some shops are now open, but with reduced footfall as you describe so there is no doubt that these setups have lost money that may otherwise have come to them ‚Äì although the benevolent Blighty government did issue loans for ‚Äòloss of earnings‚Äô to small businesses, to the tune of ten thousand pounds, so I understand. It does seem that our magic money machine can march on for quite a while‚Ä¶ Where is the tipping point?Of course the bigger issue is the loss of freedoms and the fact that so many don‚Äôt seem to care. If I point this out to people, they look at me like a madman, but it is true nonetheless. As usual, the path of action is to continue knuckling down, taking personal responsibility and trying to sow seeds into individual minds about certain truths that, as we all know, were once very obvious but are now seen as ‚Äòproblematic‚Äô.A lady I know mentioned to me that she quite enjoyed the lockdown and working from home. She mentioned that she never had to go out, could order what food she needed from the big online retailers, and could watch TV. This lady has a good grasp on reality and is not a liberal, yet when I asked her what she watched (The Good Fight and other assorted leftist propaganda vehicles), I thought: ‚ÄòHow long can a person sustain a grip on reality when being locked indoors and binge watching this stuff?‚Äô.

        2020 has collapsed some long-standing narratives, most of which we‚Äôve already been questioning around here for awhile.Fiscal Conservatism: There‚Äôs a lot more ruin left in the nation‚Äôs economy than goldbugs have ever accounted for. Hardest hit ‚Äì guys who‚Äôve predicted 10 of the last 3 recessions. There is a more-than-theoretical limit to how much money you can mouse-click into existence but we don‚Äôt know where that is yet. The MMT and Soros-economy guys aren‚Äôt totally wrong. Psychology has at least as much macro-heft right now as the number of actual widgets in actual warehouses.Red-Blue Politics: 2016-2020 have been Four More Years of liberalism and aggressive implementation of the anti-White, anti-family Woke agenda. Wiccan Cat Xrl ooga-booga aside, Trump has been the most Blacked and Queered American president in history. Libs owned!!! Zionism? Wigga please. The only way in which Trump hasn‚Äôt managed to Lean Forward is war-making. All other fronts have collapsed and all the GOP has done is bitch at Trump for not Gay Julatto-cucking harder &amp; faster.  It‚Äôs Jussie‚Äôs party now.America: it was a good idea while it lasted but as we‚Äôve said for years, that was only until 1860. The War of Northern Progression was our first fatal inflection point and America‚Äôs inevitable post-bellum demise was accelerated by the Philo-(((Phoenician))) War of 1914-1945, the Cold War and 1964-1965. With Clown World 2020, our house of race-cards is almost entirely horizontal. Discards and reshuffling required.

            Add to that list market manipulations. As I noted elsewhere in this thread, there were numerous propaganda pieces about a month ago warning against the evils of day trading and the great risk this poses to amateurs. Of course, even these small guys day trading are driving up the prices that Vulture Capitalists usually snap up for a sum after a market crash. The stories ceased once prices shot back up.Also recall that to elect Obama, a similar controlled market crash preceded his ascendancy. Apparently there wasn‚Äôt as much day trading because people were not locked in their homes then.Expect heavy restrictions to be placed on individual day trading in the near future.I will differ with you a bit about Trump. While your bill of particulars is true, for whatever reason his election caused the Cloud People to clamp down in ways they kept hidden for decades (maybe due to postponement of a proxy war with Russia). You convinced me about acceleration but I disagree with how to bring it about. The re-election of Trump, not the election of Biden, will accelerate White revolt. If Biden is elected, the slow burn strategy will return and people will be lulled back to sleep as the secret police go after ‚ÄúWhite Supremacists‚Äù and leave Normie alone for a bit. If Trump is re-elected, Zion and its henchmen are going to crank it up to 11.

        Great column.Perhaps in liberal democracy there needs to be a regular molting of the old partisan skin so a new one can emerge and refresh the debate.That is called ‚Äúproportional representation‚Äù. It is why nationalist parties are skyrocketing all over Europe: there‚Äôs a constant churn of new parties entering parliament and old parties disappearing, and sometimes the new ones make it to the big leagues. Even a country like Sweden (nominally) has about 20% nationalists in their legislature.The bad news is that it doesn‚Äôt work either. The globalists simply buy up any party that gets within striking distance of real political power, which is what happened to the Danish People‚Äôs Party, the Norwegian Progress Party, UKIP under globalist sockpuppet Nigel Farage and, I strongly suspect, the Sweden Democrats.(Hence the ‚Äúnominally‚Äù.)The only form of democracy that seems to work is the Swiss model, and before you say ‚Äúyeah, that‚Äôs because Switzerland is inhabited by the Swiss‚Äù, remember that Switzerland is a multicultural country with four official languages.

                    Yep.  I‚Äôve heard that the Federal government is quite weak in comparison to the authority within the Cantons.

                    Can‚Äôt agree with that. There is diversity and there is diversity. Switzerland‚Äôs is the former. America‚Äôs is the latter. German speakers and Italian speakers are far more likely to get along than whites and neolithic African jungle savages.

            There‚Äôs some subtle alchemy to how the Swiss have managed so well.  I‚Äôll take a stab at some of the ingredients but I admit the whole is somehow much greater than the sum of these parts.Scale, Jews &amp; circumstances (not necessarily in that order).  9 million people, 0.4% Jews.  Macro-ethnic cohesion, robust heartfelt civic nationalism, a very functional federal system that seems more ‚Äúintegrated‚Äù than our ‚Äúchecks and balances‚Äù model, as well as affluence in a small population with great geostrategic positioning.All of these have made them remarkably resistant to the kind of subversive influences that Globoshlomo can bring to bear.We would all love being Swiss.

                Read somewhere that in Switzerland the locals get to vote up or down on permanent resident status for immigrants when all the very strict requirements are met. This is a huge incentive for legal immigrants to assimilate 110%.
Imagine having immigrants neighbors have the final say on who gets to stay?  Shocking, I know.

                    Once they gave the vote to women, though, things started going down hill.  There is one Swiss area I read about that voted not to takeanyrefugees, and although the article demonized them, I don‚Äôt recall specific economic penalties the central government could impose.  There was a different town that took in one African and her 10 spawn and practically bankrupted itself to pay for that one family.

Tanja Suter, the president of the local Swiss People‚Äôs Party, claimed Ms Holten has a ‚Äúbig mouth‚Äù and residents had not wanted to give her the gift of citizenship ‚Äúif she annoys us and doesn‚Äôt respect our traditions‚Äù.

        Yes, it feels like we are still in a state of shock, like a person involved in an horrendous accident, who seems to observe events dispassionately from a third party point of view. Presumably at some point the shock will start to wear off, and then what? You write that, ‚ÄúThe government should not be able to manufacture trillions of dollars without causing hyperinflation.‚Äù and that, ‚ÄúThe streets are still mostly empty during the work day and many businesses are still closed. Those that are open have all sorts of restrictions and they seem to have fewer customers.‚Äù I suspect that there is a link there. I don‚Äôt know much about economic theory, but economists talk about the velocity of money being a factor in inflation. It could be that the Chinese have visited that ancient curse of theirs upon us, ‚ÄúMay you live in interesting times‚Äù.

            Your initial description is excellent. We are, most of us, in a state of shock.The response to the virus, particularly in Blue states and the MSM, has been completely politicized. These psychos actually think strangling the economy and psychologically torturing Middle America, while openly encouraging the black underclass to riot, is a winning election strategy.Their hatred of Trump is so overwhelming that they have brought the country to its knees in a suicidal attempt to remove him.To any semi rational person, this all looks like most of the country, and nearly all of our elites, have lost their minds.So yes, I think most average Americans are in a state of shock.Where that leads is anyone‚Äôs guess.

                Or maybe the average person has watched how things have gone for the last few years, and is actually somewhat mentally prepared for where we are at today.  The question is, how much worse, in what ways, and how quickly, before Joe Normie is finally overwhelmed?

        A long time ago, in the 20th century‚Äì we had an idea that we could simply bomb civilian populations into submission.
After we killed a few tens of millions this way, we decided it didn‚Äôt work, because people have a remarkable ability to adapt to a ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù.
The ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù, of the virus, and the protests, has always been the left‚Äôs best weapon.

            When did ‚Äúwe‚Äù decide that it didn‚Äôt work?  I must have missed that. Because last I checked the US was still attempting to bomb the Mideast and Afghanistan into submission ‚Äì and it wasn‚Äôt working.  I really don‚Äôt think there was any concious decision or recognition of reality made on that one ‚Äì it was simply that the cost of the bombing got too high (for us) ‚Äì so we stopped trying.If you‚Äôve been watching ‚Äì the lefties still think the bombing thing works ‚Äì otherwise you wouldn‚Äôt have reps from CA threatening to use nukes on the rest of the country.

        Teacher here.  I see a building resentment towards teachers being paid for no work from the private sector gang.  I‚Äôm going to deflect this towards administrations more than teachers as most teachers, are itching to go back to work.  I will admit many teachers have vaginas literally and figuratively that have swallowed the post-modernist, critical theory kool-aid, but for the majority of us, we are just looking for some courage from administration to get back to work.  Looking at the administrations point of view, all it will take is one weezing asthmatic to keel over walking up a flight of stairs to see us locked down again and fighting lawsuits.  Believe me, as Edward Dutton would say, we have a ton of sickly mutants walking around the halls these days.Slightly off topic, try being a teacher these days and listening to the white fragility trope. Had a POC integration specialist tell me that part of their curriculum was dedicated to teaching their kids about white privilege and victimization culture.  Have seen a lot more resentment from our blacks in recent years.

        And yet‚Ä¶amid the strange calm there is a set of people‚Äìblacks and white race traitors‚Äìwho behave incredibly disruptively and destructively. Normal whites, OTOH, seem willing and able to tolerate just about anything. This is not altogether reassuring. The forces of destruction and misery have everything going their way and have for the last half century. The forces of creation and happiness are watching their civilization be ripped to pieces yet are not flying the oriflamme and donning the Phrygian cap. It is an inversion of what should be. Adaptability is a good thing unless you adapt to your own obliteration.

        The canoe analogy is good. If you‚Äôve ever canoed on a lazy river, it is easier to get back into the canoe. Rafting on rapids? Not as easy. In both cases, hopefullly you wore a floatation vest (reguired usually for liability reasons), and were taught to merely float feet down current until you could get to dry ground. Point: 99.9% of the time falling into the river isn‚Äôt a problem and is even expected on many runs. But yes, what if you capsize just upriver from a Niagra? üôÅ

            Quick internet math tells me you‚Äôd need to be making at least $80k(!) to break even with unemployment + $600. So that tells me there‚Äôs probably a lot of belt tightening going on out there among the employed and a lot of blue collar people who are using the extra to pay off debts.That can‚Äôt be right, can it?I got lucky and got called back almost immediately. Have made some progress on debt but only because I‚Äôm spending less since everything was closed for a while. That and acquiring some things that will hold value. Other than that it‚Äôs been status quo.

                    I don‚Äôt either. Doesn‚Äôt seem real. Searched it, seemed like 70% was a good cap.


{80000(.7)}/52+600=1677

80000/52=1538

Even if capped at 50%:

(80000/2)/52+600=1369

Someone making $40k capped at 50% would be getting $984 or somewhere around $50k/yr.

Decent money! Either that or there‚Äôs serious capping going on. OTOH I was on unemployment years ago when I was only making $30k and I think I was still getting quite a bit more than $275.

In other words, the AVERAGE person should be collecting what would be about $50k/yr!  Unbelievable.

        A strange slew of news items appeared about a month or so back, basically demonizing individual day trading and saying amateurs are setting themselves up for financial ruin, yadda, yadda. My guess is the Vulture Capitalists, who thrive on cratering the economy and then snapping up assets for half or so of their value, are pissed at the competition. The corporate propaganda organs stopped with those items as suddenly as they started.Perhaps the propaganda had the intended consequences and slowed down individuals who decided to try their hand at mini-Vulture Capitalism, or the prices got high enough that it was no longer an issue. Regardless, expect another orchestrated market crash between now and November, which will be followed by propaganda pieces warning against buying up devalued stocks.

        We‚Äôre a very wealthy society. Even the homeless gain weight from overeating. We still have a lot of social capital and tons of physical capital. Everything is still peachy because we‚Äôre still burning through the fat. We probably still have a lot of fat to burn through.  USA Today is now begging the D-party to get their friends in CorpUSA to tank the economy as insurance for the upcoming election. So hardly anyone seems too worried about what happens further on down stream even if we intentionally make things worse.Most people have jobs they do to survive but don‚Äôt really like so they can buy crap they don‚Äôt really need. Now they get handed enough to make do without having to spend their day doing a job they don‚Äôt much like. Not many see this as a negative. So no one is complaining much.The social and physical capital burn off at some point. Both are currently being taken out of White communities and transferred to non-whites at the Gov and Corp levels.  So when living off the past begins to thin out who gets the Gov cheese and who doesn‚Äôt?There‚Äôs a falls at the end of this stream. Five feet? Five hundred feet?If you aren‚Äôt prepping someone else will decide for you how you ride this out when the rough patch comes round.

            So, they‚Äôve created ridiculously huge supplies of money. One way to wipe that out is through writing off bad debt.

            Debt destruction in the economy is offsetting a good deal of the printing.  For example, if people are using their government gravy money to retire credit card debt then basically what‚Äôs happening is the CC debt is being moved from the consumer‚Äôs ledger to the Federal Government‚Äôs ledger.Another piece is that since so much of U.S. currency is held abroad that the inflation jolt is cushioned, essentially by stealing a little bit of wealth from every foreigner holding dollars (or dollar backed assets).The last part is interesting: if foreigners get sick of Uncle Sam stealing from them, then it‚Äôs game over.  This might come about if we get a full fledged third world government in charge this fall since people around the world can choose from any number of unstable third world currencies with which to trade.  My guess would be then that the money-men who run the country would do everything in their power to keep that from coming to pass (i.e., Stacy Abrams and the like will not be let anywhere near the levers of power and will be kept in Angry-Tweet jail).

        The biggest head scratcher is the economy. Sure, the Fed and the gov‚Äôt pumped trillions of dollars into it via money printing and borrowing. Indeed, pumped more than what the economy produces in GDP terms. So, that may explain the lack of a depression.However, you still have 30 million people not working. People on the ground not doing jobs. Presumably, you shouldn‚Äôt be able to paper that over with dollars ‚Äì printed or borrowed. Dollars can‚Äôt substitute for real work.Which makes me wonder if these people were doing the equivalent of busy work. Z has noted how when he worked in an office and there were lay-offs, you couldn‚Äôt notice any drop off in production. Maybe we‚Äôre witnessing the same thing here. Perhaps many job ‚Äì and thus workers ‚Äì aren‚Äôt that useful or necessary.

                Quite possible. We may be witnessing the first unveiling of that truth.But let‚Äôs also remember how huge a portion of the U.S. economy is unecessary services. If 200 million Americans decide to go out to dinner once a week instead of twice a week, a lot of waiters, cooks, restaurant managers, food delivery drivers, etc., lose their jobs. Those losses won‚Äôt be made up for in job gains at the grocery store and cookware industry.But does the standard of living for those 200 million drop?Not really. They miss the enjoyment of going out one night a week, but gain the enjoyment of cooking a nice meal and sitting down with family.That example is true of many jobs. They just aren‚Äôt necessary and the joy (or marginal utility) they bring to consumers might be low or, even possibly, negative, i.e. making a nice, healthy meal at home can be more enjoyable than grabbing some take-out.

They‚Äôll have to pay unemployment benefits for all the fired cooks and waiters, not to mention the infrastructure of a modern society that those unemployed will still have access to but not pay for.
A tanking economy makes us all poorer, not just the ones losing their jobs.

            &gt; Which makes me wonder if these people were doing the equivalent of busy work. Z has noted how when he worked in an office and there were lay-offs, you couldn‚Äôt notice any drop off in production. Maybe we‚Äôre witnessing the same thing here. Perhaps many job ‚Äì and thus workers ‚Äì aren‚Äôt that useful or necessary.With the first round layoffs of 10% or so of the force, barely anyone who is left blinks, as it‚Äôs mostly business as usual and they can actually be more productive without the deadwood and toxic people no longer around.  It‚Äôs on round 2 and above when the useful people who don‚Äôt know how to show their value get the chopping block when the pain begins.

                So would I.  But I think there is a misconception wrt such positions in academe.  They are created to keep the numbers up wrt AA hiring and minority student enrollment.  In that regard they will never go away, albeit they are certainly barnacles on the ship.

                        This has already happened to a large degree. For decades, diversity or equal opportunity, led to the less-qualified to gravitate towards certain type of positions, which of course meant ones where competence in a STEM field was not needed. Unfortunately for everybody, these positions tend to be adminstrative and even of decision-making, even leadership.

Note, the source of that information, cited in the Zero Hedge article to which Z linked, is the Fed.

                I believe it, but would need more info.  For example, suppose you were like the typical low income credit card user before COVID-19‚Äìwho would pay minimum on balances and always seemed to use the card as soon as there was some room to put more on the account.Now comes COVID lockdown.  You‚Äôre scared and can‚Äôt go out much.  You stop impulse spending, you have a little extra cash.  You continue to pay the minimum due, but fail to spend any of the newly available free credit line.  Voila‚Äîinstant pay down!  But I would not necessarily call that a sea change in behavior or indicative of a new norm.

            My wife tried to get a piano moved a month ago, and the owners of the moving companies we talked to wanted the work, but complained most of their staff was still on unemployment, and had no incentive to go back to work.

        ‚ÄúThat means we really have no idea where this will all end. Maybe that‚Äôs why there is a strange calm over daily life.‚ÄùI know that everything normal and familiar in my life started to fall apart sometime in February and this has accelerated ever since.The craziness over the so-called pandemic caused a cascade of events to happen in my family due to the shut-down of medical services as we tried to ‚Äúsave the hospitals‚Äù. And then it turned out it was all a waste.In other news, many of my favorite places will never come back. Admittedly we have always liked the small mom and pop joints, but even some larger places closed near us.There is no place I can go without seeing stupid ‚Äúprecautions‚Äù being taken. Masks, distancing, and so on is everywhere.One woman, say late 30s, damn near cried because she had to get within 4 feet of me at the pharmacy. (I don‚Äôt wear masks, am medically exempt)Ok, I did not need to type all that to say: this 2020 sucks big time and I don‚Äôt think we will get over this for years. By then both wife and I will be victims of the madness. I just hope they don‚Äôt list me as dying of corona. That would be the final insult.

        What comes next is ‚ÄúThe great reset‚Äù. They want us in smart cities, locked in our cubicle homes and online‚Äìit‚Äôs the new world normal. The West is headed for an austerity phase that will last till they get their one world government and the reign of the antichrist.  (Are there no Christians amongst zman‚Äôs readers? Have any of you read Revelation? You might want to do so.) Their goal, also, is the erasure of European man. Partly because we are the only race that may say ‚Äúno‚Äù to their plan, partly because they hate us since we were, pray God we will be again, the Christ-bearing race. Why, for instance, do you think they wouldn‚Äôt let us celebrate Easter, or why do you think they want to get rid of icons of white Jesus? Soon the true church, not these fake churches infected by the satanic negro worship of liberalism, will have to go to the catacombs. Anyway, a bit of a rant but I‚Äôm surprised that z, who is much smarter than me, isn‚Äôt aware of Christian eschatology at least in a cursory fashion. The only way out is through a heartfelt love of Jesus and our people. ‚ÄúIn this world you will have tribulation, but take heart, I have overcome the world.‚Äù John 16:33.  God bless all, and God bless zman for the work he does for our people.

                Do I seem mind controlled to you? You didn‚Äôt address any points I made about nwo. Fighting liberalism with new age paganism is fighting fire with fire.

Anyway, read Hiliaire Belloc‚Äôs Europe is the faith, or for that matter any epic poem from Chaucer to Chesterton to see what Christianity did for our people.  A good site to go to is Cambria will not yield. Beautiful prose about our plight. Anyway, I‚Äôm sure we want the same thing, the continuation and flourishing of the indo-european race.

You give me such hope!

Both believers and non- are right, yet both are wrong. Why?

They have different models, because they have different functions, thus they have different core operating systems.

They address different aspects- but yes, we are brothers and sisters, made by Creation to fight the ever-hungry Darkness, here, in this specific environment, a living planet.

The Christ god of the whites is not under, or lesser than, the Abrahamic god- this is the propaganda, the deception.

                            Saints are also de facto minor and liminal deities that have kept the flame of paganism alive.  Anyone who has travelled Italy can certainly attest to that
we we still use pagan names for days of the week.  I imagine if they had tried to change them to comport with Christianity, back in the day, there would have been problems.

                Talking is cheap and you can always find arguments to justify any opinion. But facts are facts. When Christianity was strong, the West was strong. Now that Christianity is weak, the West is weak. As you American people say, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a fact, Jack‚Äù.Today Hagia Sophia (the beautiful church built by emperor Justinian) reverts to being a mosque after decades of being a museum. Erdogan signed the executive order today. The same Erdogan that said:‚ÄúThe minarets are our bayonets, the mosques are our barracks, the believers are our soldiers‚ÄùYou don‚Äôt go to a civilization war without a religion. Between a Muslim world full of holy fervor and a skeptic Europe that does not believe in anything, who will win?The answer is clear. I am from Europe and thirty years ago, there was no Muslim person in my hometown. They didn‚Äôt even know what Islam was. Now they have a mosque (they build another one because the first one got small), they have an entire neighborhood and they reproduce much quickly than us. You see hiyabs everywhere.Is the opposite happening? There are neighborhoods full of skeptics in Muslim countries? Don‚Äôt make me laugh. The Muslim world is more religious now that 30 years ago. Who is winning and who is losing?So, yes, enjoy your Aesop‚Äôs fables while it lasts. It is clear that a fox who talks trying to get some grapes will inspire you to fight the same way Allah inspires Muslim to fight. And pigs fly.

            There are Christians here. But some of us do not hold theological viewpoints that emphasize the AntiChrist as a literal man. I personally believe that term could have referred to a Roman leader who persecuted Christians. Anyway nations and civilizations have risen and fallen down through history since Christ without the appearance of an AntiChrist figure.I prefer to stay away from the details of theology and focus on the general principles of sociology and trends, the history of man, and reason and order which this blog does well.As a Christian I believe God is controlling history but I also do not want to bring too much theology here because this site is a general dissident site with wide ranging views. We as Christians can be on the same page as other dissidents and contribute here without going too deep into our own theological beliefs.i prefer to not dive to deep into theological arguments here and I think that benefits everyone.

                I‚Äôm glad to see there are some other skeptics here, as well as believers, just to balance the arguments. One thought that occurs to me is that being a ‚Äúreligion‚Äù or having ‚Äúreligious rights‚Äù seems like one of the few legal ways to discriminate, or pro-freedom of association, these days. Of course it‚Äôs not a blanket freedom, but court decisions uphold that you can refuse to give birth control coverage to employees, or decline the opportunity to bake a gay wedding cake, and no doubt, more substantive religious freedoms. Personally, I bristle at the idea that ‚Äúreligous‚Äù and ‚Äúcharitable‚Äù organizations are excused from laws that apply to most others, but perhaps we could put that to good use‚Ä¶There may well be a way that we could wrap our thing at least partially in a church wrapper.

        Part of what I think this is showing us is that the US and world economies have been living with a secret UBI for a long time. Much of what most people do is superfluous. All the paper pushers and most of the service workers might as well have been digging holes and filling them in.We paid them far in excess of the necessity of their work, so when all of a sudden their work didn‚Äôt exist any more, it didn‚Äôt really matter much. When you suddenly take away all the yoga teachers, waitresses, massage therapists, hairdressers and clothing store clerks, it doesn‚Äôt really affect the day-to-day operations of the actual productive economy. Turns out that just paying them to sit home works just as well ‚Ä¶ in the short term.In the long term, I don‚Äôt know. This is uncharted territory. My gut tells me it won‚Äôt end well.As for inflation, nothing makes sense to me. I sit there staring at charts:https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/money-supply-m2And I don‚Äôt understand how things are not collapsing. Others have mentioned that maybe it is because a lot of the money isn‚Äôt circulating, but quite a bit certainly is.The money supply curve looks like a geometric increase, and the loans to private sector curve is tracking along with it pretty well. Both just shot through the roof in the past few months, but the Bank Lending Rate is way down and the CPI and core inflation rate aren‚Äôt tracking with money supply at all.I don‚Äôt think that can happen naturally. I can only assume there‚Äôs an organized effort to keep raw material and commodity prices down to avoid increasing consumer prices.

            You are onto something with the stealth UBI already being in place.
Yes, something is staving off hyperinflation. And, again, you are right about it being a market manipulation of some sort.

                The US Dollar system requires the massive credit creation to be exported out of the country to gain the benefits before domestic inflation can happen as well as to supply enough dollars overseas so that international transactions will continue to use dollars. If dollars come back, they are used to buy real estate or treasury securities. It also REQUIRES trade deficits to export dollars. It helps that China is a low cost producer to keep inflation disguised. When all the low cost producers are gone, that will no longer work. The problem now is that international commerce has slowed dramatically. The plumbing is clogged and the dollars are stuck here and accumulating.

                That will end once either China or Russia lets it be known they fully intend to use nukes and the Blue coasts demand and obtain immediate surrender/de-escalation. The planned proxy war with Russia will end immediately for that reason.
THEN the idea of the U.S. as a paramount military power will end. It‚Äôs not true now but nothing will illustrate it better.

        People are getting paid to stay home and watch Netflix. Why would you go back to work when you make more staying home and collecting unemployment?What seems to be becoming apparent is that an awful lot of jobs in the American economy are just not that useful or important. Our economic system is built around a whole bunch of jobs that only exist to provide employment to people with no useful skills. As long as we all pretend that made-up out of thin air ‚Äúmoney‚Äù has value, we can keep it going but even that will end at some point.

        Waaay off topic, but maybe thought provoking, nonetheless, is the significant anatomical physical differences between Whites and Blacks.  We all know that Blacks are super-athletic, with longer arms and legs, but shorter torsos ‚Ä¶ along with some other ‚Äúdifferences‚Äù.  But it‚Äôs interesting to think how would things be if these physical endowments suddenly were swapped between the races ‚Ä¶ minus the cognitive difference between Whites and Blacks.  Its arguable, as Jimmy The Greek said, that Blacks were chosen, as slaves, to be these physical specimens that we now have to deal with ‚Ä¶ but what if the shoe was on the other foot?

        There‚Äôs not a lot of ‚Äúinflation‚Äù because it‚Äôs hidden or diluted by other meansDeficit spending becomes the pretext for mass immigration.  $26 trillion is a lot but less on a per capita basis the more people, thus, bring in more so the true weight of h debt burden is spread out over 330 million peopleDoes a fast food burger taste as good as it did 10 years ago  No because even though prices have certainly spiked in the past few years quality and portion sizes have gone down.  A combo meal would be maybe $20 if they kept to the same ingredients and quality and portion sizes.  Look at steak prices.   Steaks are not as good anymore unless you are willing to pay $20 or more an ounce where they used to be $4 not very long ago.  Plus China is scarfing down some of our best cuts, as with restaurants, and consumers get the leftovers.  Lower quality hides the inflation.  The taste and quality of chicken and bacon and so much more is way down but prices have also gone up by quite a lot.  Quality of mass marketed chicken is in the toiletcost of housing.  Home prices have spiked, and that is because of money printing.  Stock prices are propped up by the same.It goes on and on. Through a combination of lower quality and reduced portion sizes and spiking costs of housing, hard to say there hasn‚Äôt been much inflation

        Being as black-pilled as I am, I suspect that inflation (and hyper-inflation) will occur when (((they))) deem it necessary and fitting.My mantra is that the media can create any crisis that they want to create ‚Ä¶ this could be one of them.Does anyone remember the inflation of the late-70s and early-80s?

        Of course, the dollar is the World‚Äôs reserve currency.  My understanding is that international exchanges need dollars to be the exchange standard ‚Ä¶ other currencies are too volatile and manipulated by the gubment (think the Chinese RMB).  So, alot of dollars are held in reserve by various institutions.  Maybe this kind of ‚Äúsoaks up‚Äù the massive amount of dollars that have been created, and props up the value.  I‚Äôm waaay out of my league here, BTW, so grains of salt apply.

        Regarding inflation, its a bit difficult to make sense of it.  Inflation is usually thought of as too much money chasing too few goods.  But when slow growth is forecast, the impact seems to be deflationary ‚Ä¶ why not inflationary since fewer goods are being produced?We‚Äôre $23 trillion in debt and you can get a 30 year mortgage at &lt;4% ‚Ä¶ how is this possible if growth (think GDP) is low and we‚Äôre always staving off some deflation?Note that Japan‚Äôs debt-to-GDP ration is much higher than the USA‚Äôs, and they seem to be getting along just fine over there.  BOJ rates are low and no inflation in sight, and everyone is eating.Perhaps we‚Äôve entered into this post-scarity state where its expected that automation can create as much as we need, but why the low GDP numbers ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs what I can‚Äôt explain.

        In point of fact, at present in the Soviet State of Mexifornia you CAN tell your landlord or mortgage holder to screw.  There is a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures.  Real property ‚Äúburdened‚Äù by debt obligations has been temporarily nationalized to protect the proles.  Similarly, utilities like electricity and internet are not in danger of being shut off for arrearages.  I suspect they simply focused on keeping their credit cards useful to ensure the flow of crap from Amazon et al.  How else can you buy your designer mask to virtue signal?  At the end of this experiment, there will either be a massive past due bill or a debt jubilee.  Reality cannot be forestalled indefinitely.

            Z Man said: ‚ÄúWhat we are living through right now is probably one of those times when the partisan framework gives way to a new partisan framework. Perhaps in liberal democracy there needs to be a regular molting of the old partisan skin so a new one can emerge and refresh the debate. After all, forty years ago, the Left was endlessly going on about free speech and the dangers of corporate media. Today, it is the Right that champions speech and opposes corporate media.‚ÄùI‚Äôll tell you what I think. Soon you‚Äôll see the establishment right and Neo-Conservatives blending more closely and openly with the liberal left. There won‚Äôt be so much political theater. The whole thing will simply become more unabashedly corporatist. And if they need to apply a veneer it will be something to placate the hard left rank and file. Anarcho-tyranny and the great stakeholder reset. As you say, the little push back they got in the state capitals just faded away. I‚Äôm sure it looks to them like they have us just where they want us. Are they wrong?

        Youth sports, social life, and race riots aside, you paint a rosy picture, Z.People spending less, paying down debts like you say. I‚Äôll never complain about less consumerism. Teachers don‚Äôt want to go back to the schools. I say good, let‚Äôs talk about shutting down the public schools and public funding for universities. Less Hollywood. Less brainwashing.Real estate out my way has cooled off considerably. Houses for sale for months instead of a couple of weeks. Even the 55+ stuff isn‚Äôt filling as quickly as it used to. Virtually no new commercial development. Most new construction I see is modest homes on single lots, not big subdivisions. If appearance matches reality the regular guy is doing better than the locust. No complaints there.A lot to like. One can hope we‚Äôre calmly transitioning to a new and saner reality. The one huge downside is that small business has taken a big hit. Hopefully people are planning for unemployment benefits to expire.Who knows though. Big things are happening but nobody seems to know what. One side still thinks ‚Äòwhiteness‚Äô is ending, the other seems to be conducting an orderly withdrawal from that narrative. Just so long as we aren‚Äôt staggering into a crash, right?Once the debt is gone we‚Äôll see how much value we actually have, and I bet it‚Äôs a lot. There will be plenty of pain, but nothing we can‚Äôt survive.
