            It’s somewhat ironic that the former paper of record’s “Public Protestant” is a Jew of somewhat ambiguous affiliations – Brooks’ wife is supposedly a conservative Jew and his eldest son serves in the Israeli Defense Force.  I suppose the inference here is that the family keeps kosher, observes the Sabbath and goes to synagogue.  Brooks’ new “morality” schtick involves his new book, and some have commented on the favorable account of Christianity contained therein, and even opining whether this means that Brooks is contemplating conversion.  Brooks himself has been coy on the subject.Brooks’ bona fides as a “conservative”, in the bright, earnest eyes of the Times’ ownership and readership (and which also holds for their other housebroken pajama boy, Ross Douthat), derive from Brooks’ quaint insistence that a “public morality” that differs from the current enthusiasms of the Cult can be both legitimate and worthy of serious discussion and contemplation – in the same manner as Douthat maintains that the policy preferences of the opposition party are grounded not so much in metaphysical evil as a differing philosophy of governing.  While to anyone outside the hive, these ideas are self-evident to the point of banality, to members of the Cult they are remarkable, shocking, heretical.  Given the circumstances, Brooks and Douthat habitually sugarcoat their message in a Mary Poppinsish manner in the vain hope that somehow this may induce the medicine to go down – although it can’t and it won’t.  But what it does do is to alienate real conservatives who rightly see Brooks’ and Douthats’ antics and contortions not as compromises inherent in their positions but as the unseemly and unserious gyrations of court buffoons. Conservatives find their views deliberately misrepresented and maligned in the beltway media as a matter of course, but it’s particularly galling to have ones views contorted into pleasing shapes by pet mandarins who go by the name of “conservative” only because it flatters the vanity of Pinch Sulzberger to so name them.

                I think an interesting topic to explore would be how it ha been so easy for Jews in America to swap out their ancient faith for the Progressive Faith. There have been some non-racists books on the subject, but nothing by incitement or smart people, as far as I know. Norman Podhoretz did a book on the subject years ago. The Ashkenazim had tremendous selection pressure in favor of high degrees of clannishness and religiosity. Maybe that’s the hook for them into The New Religion. Orthodox Jews vote Republicans while Reformed vote Democrat. The former want to avoid the world while the later wish to rule it.Either way, American Jews have embraced the serve-the-world/save-the-world ethos of Public Protestantism as a replacement for the ancient religion. Like the old Congregationalists, Reformed synagogues are hotbeds of social activism.

                    In the last century, Jews enthusiastically abandoned the rigors of their ancient faith for another dogmatic, grandly Utopian and ultimately murderous project.  Progessivism, as of today, can only claim two of three. But there’s always hope for tomorrow.Why this should be so is indeed mysterious. Doubly so, given all we hear about Jewish mental superiority, which one would think would protect one from falling under the spell of demonstrably false gods. My ignorance has never prevented me from making a conjecture, and so let me offer this: for millennia within the practice of Judaism the emphasis upon the observance of the Law as the fundamental act of faith was interwoven so as to make them – the act of observance and the act of faith – inseparable; thus, in modern guise but as a habit of mind, a susceptibility for the adoption and observance of novel dogmas still comes with the enduring obligation to fervently believe in them.

                        Why this should be so is indeed mysterious. Doubly so, given all we hear about Jewish mental superiority, which one would think would protect one from falling under the spell of demonstrably false gods.I think I can answer that one.  Given their history, Jews had every reason to believe that ethno-nationalism is an existential threat to them.  Utopian socialism — Rousseau’s, Marx’s, whomever’s —startswith the elimination of ethno-nationalism.  The Wobblies’ anti-WW1 slogan expressed it best: No war but class war.  With nationalism eliminated, Jews are just smarter-than-average folks with odd dietary habits.[The Utopian goal of ending ethno-nationalism, btw, is why so many folks insist on calling the Nazis — the NationalSocialists— “right wing.”  The Utopian internationalists are left wing; right is the opposite of left; therefore any and all nationalist movements — even explicitlysocialistones — are “right wing.]
