        I guess the bottom line is Mr. Pilkington and Napoleon must have to be concerned what our thoughts on any subject are.  They need to understand that otherwise the lamp post out on the street or the huge oak in the park may have some extra decorations otherwise…

        Anyone else see the 64 year-old Penn State professor that was just arrested in a public park for proving former Pennsylvania Rick Santorum correct?
I won’t post a link because the story is the absolute pit of degeneracy.
What did Santorum know, and when did he know it?
How much do you want to bet this arrest is the tip of the iceberg?

                Santorum suggested that gay marriage would lead to bestiality, among other perversions. It was considered outrageous even to suggest!

            I searched this out, read a headline, and … no more.  I bailed from the article.  The headline was enough and a sentence or two was all I could stomach.
I notice this new one involves Pedd State.  I wonder if the esteemed chemical engineering professor knew Jerry Sandusky and they were buds back in the day.  Clown World 64 Mystery Theatre 3000.

        Z is a conspiracy theorist’s conspiracy theorist, at least at times. Today’s essay is dismaying in its plausibility. Z has pulled the curtain aside and lets us see the stage crew that manages our Presidents, Senators and so on. I’m inclined to ask: who manages the crew? Is there something beyond the Usual Suspects (donors, favored allies and corporations, and so forth)? Some equivalent of the Smoking Man in the “X Files”?One of Ron Unz’s takes on history claims that FDR’s handlers (whom? USSR?  American Jewry? Somebody else?) even in the 1930s had so much power that they could even control the Republicans. Enter Wendell Willkie. For such a minor figure of U.S. history, he seems to have a remarkably detailed Wikipedia bio. According to Unz, They (whoever They were) needed to make sure they had an acceptable Republican running against FDR in the 1940 election, against the unlikely event FDR lost. Willkie, a lifelong Democrat, switched parties and somehow gained the nomination. Conveniently, he was the only Republican in favor of intervening in the war.  (This, I recall, was the gist of Unz’s argument.) At the risk of stating the obvious, Europe was at war since late 1939, but the 1940 U.S. election was done more than a year before the Japs “encouraged” us to join the fun. I guess powerful forces (who?) wanted the US in the war.Anyway, please pardon my rambling. I do think it’s somewhat on topic re today’s essay. Unseen powers pulling strings, including deciding who gets the nomination from either party, would seem to be a longstanding practice indeed. The cited example is 82 years ago.

I believe Ron Unz has written at length on FDR’s reasons for wanting to goad Japan into a war with the U.S.

            Theater indeed. Hard to say what’s authentic. Whatever his real motives may be, Musk is providing a platform to some popular folk. Tucker Carlson is brand new there and he’s not exactly pulling any punches. Indeed, he is kneeing the Deep State in the balls. All an act? If so, what’s the game plan? Polarize the country’s politics even more? I rarely watched him at Fox, but now I’m a fan of his podcasts. No Twitter membership even required.

        I’ve always thought Biden was a strong candidate, and I think he might have even prevailed had he been allowed to run in 2016. His younger self could have pulled off victories in 2008 and 2012, as well.Now, don’t get me wrong. When I say he’s a “strong candidate,” that doesn’t mean I like the guy. I just mean that he’s a real greaseball.. He is deeply, deeply immersed in the Washington mob, he has the dirt on everybody, and everybody has the dirt on him. That makes him kind of untouchable.The party made him wait until he was an old man while they field The One and Hillary. Frankly, they owe him.

                Yep, and when caught plagiarizing, he sank like a rock with the voters.  Nope, Biden won (not really) because Trump lost (not really).  What happened was a vote for Biden was a vote against Trump.  Biden only wins when there is no alternative—and then the election needs fortifying.

            It was enjoyable to watch him be humiliated, kowtowing to wokeness and its representatives, thinking that was the new route to Party favor. His abjection got him nothing—or only another beach house, but he already had a couple. The memory of him is destroyed forever. I don’t know if he’s a “real” Jew, but if he is, that’s his idea of hell, and he packed up and moved right into it while we all watched it live.

        There is another reason Biden was nominated. As Z has pointed out, Biden has been for years regarded in the senate as a joke and dumb as a box of rocks. Most people on the right felt the same way about him and could do nothing but shake their heads and say ‘can you believe this guy?’Trump inspires teeth grinding, foaming at the mouth hatred in those on the left while the response on the right to Biden was more disbelief that he was the nominee.Never underestimate the significance unmitigated hatred has on the voters. Biden did not, at least in 2020, inspire such hatred on the right. He does now and that is another problem for the dems.For the record I have loathed and detested Biden ever since the Clarence Thomas conformation hearings.

            Hatred is a big part of how Trump won in 2016. Despite MSM astroturfing to the contrary, there was always a critical mass of voters who disapproved of Her, had made up their minds about Her long ago and weren’t going to change them, and were going to vote for whoever was against Her. I should know, I was one of them.
Trump on the ballot in 2024 likewise guarantees maximum left turnout, even before fortification. Regardless of who his opponent is.

        I think the larger reason for Biden’s appointment to the job is to continue the meltdown of all the existing institutions.  Brandon and Kamala are destroying the offices of the president and VP by their simple presence in the positions.  Now that the vote is fortified, public appeal is not an issue, and melting down the three visible branches of our government (executive, legislative, judicial), in favor of the ascendancy of the invisible fourth branch, the bureaucracy state, is the order of the day.  Brandon is an ideal choice for the task, and will remain there, if his health allows.

        Biden is a direct result of how they cleared the decks for the inevitability of Her. It was always supposed to be Her, as far back as 2006, maybe farther. In 2008 it was supposed to be Her. It’s fun to remind the “democracy” lovers that she actually got more votes in the 2008 primary than The Precious did, but due to the way the D primary was structured he won anyway. She actually got more votes than him in California, yet he won the California primary. But I digress.In clearing the decks for Her, first in 2008 and then in 2016, the Democrat Party prevented itself from developing a bench. There was nobody else. It was Her or nobody. Conjunctive with its leftward lurch which killed its ability to win any states in flyover country like Slick did in the 90s. So once she was eliminated, all they had left to turn to was an old husk like Biden. There was nobody else. Biden is/was kind of a holdover from the old days when candidates mattered and they felt they had to pick someone who looked presentable, who they could portray as qualified or competent (I know, I know). A white guy in a suit with some experience. But in fact those considerations no longer matter.In current year, as always, 40% will vote D no matter who, no matter what. The same 40% who approve of drag queen story hour and topless trannies on the White House lawn. And all they have to do is fortify on top of that. With advanced improved 21st century post plandemic fortification processes, the flood of 3rd worlders across the border, and the motor voter registration thereof, it doesn’t really matter who they pick.

Stay out of range of the enemy’s artillery; build up logistics to flank their side when their chickens come home to roost.

            In the real Animal Farm, there is a Ben that is, quite literally, a wise ass. 🙂 For a layabout: “And the behaviour of the cat was somewhat peculiar. It was soon noticed that when there was work to be done the cat could never be found. She would vanish for hours on end, and then reappear at meal-times, or in the evening after work was over, as though nothing had happened. But she always made such excellent excuses, and purred so affectionately, that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions.”

        “ Have we reached the point in the Praetorian Guard phase of the empire where the FBI changes rulers simply as a way to show they can change the ruler when they please? ”I maintain this has been the case for at least 50+ years.  Remember old J Edgar?  He ran the FBI from creation until his death.  But he was old—older than mandatory retirement allowed.  Every year Congress voted him exemption and J Edgar kept cross-dressing around the office.  How did this happen?From what I read, Hoover would visit all new Congress members for a meet and greet.  He’d bring along the FBI’s “unverified” dossier on the Congress person.  In this dossier was every imaginable accusation of mopery imaginable.  Who knows if these were real or made up (by the FBI), but they were enough to sink a Congressman’s career if revealed.J Edgar would, of course, play these accusations/rumors down as utter nonsense and would reassure the (stunned/scared) Congressman that they would never see the “light of day”… “as long as I’m Head of the FBI”.  Of course, everyone voted to keep J Edgar in office when the time came.Now along comes “The Don”.  He’s politically dumber than a bag of hammers and the current Director, James Comey, stops by for a visit to play the blackmail game with a totally made up “Russian Dossier”.  Trump falls for it, initially. Rather than fire Comey on the spot, he hesitates and begins to inquire on the sly as to exactly what’s happening with an organization he assumes he controls.  Well, the rest is history.  By the time Trump decides to act on this traitor, the dossier is released and the damage done.I’d pay to be a fly on the wall in that first meeting.

                Can we expect something special for (((Bloomsday))) tomorrow?Funny thing is Bloom’s kind of OK. It’s Irish Kinch needed a smack about the head.Always worth stressing (as you have often done) that there’s more to the collapse of Western Civ than the usual suspects. Plenty of ‘Us’ have been sawing at the branches and trunks for a long time now.I first read Joyce at an impressionable age. I now think that there *should* be an index of forbidden books.Dubliners, however, should be required reading. Every young just-married (*) man should be forced to read The Dead.* Otherwise birth rate –&gt; Zero.

        Z – agree except “ The voters are then left to choose.”Voters? Why involve these idiots?It’s automated already.Given the level of agency both morally and in terms of power it should be automated, and Dominion does this, voting not anything important like say SportsBall, or porn which DO have choices.
And the Voters deserve it.They are idiots.🇺🇸 deserves the government it’s getting good and hard.

            During the Cold War, the parties produced candidate that were pretty much the same. Was Carter that much different from Ford or even Nixon? What the general election did was give the ruling class the sense that the people were in support of the consensus. That is why they chose to fortify the 2020 election rather than work with Trump. The former let them pretend they are on the side of the people, while the latter would have meant acknowledging that they had been on the wrong side of the people, maybe even on the wrong side of history.

                True, no disagreement.My point was the elections – admittedly with some growing pains – are being automated.   As they should be, its an enormous waste of energy and time to put more than a few keystrokes into.Its like the last meetings of the Temperance Union – which were happening until a few years ago you know- or a government department who’s function is long fulfilled but still getting a budget;  its a pastime that pays, like the Bureau of Rural Electrification, elections aren’t for adjusted adults.In fact very close to the American Catholic Church pews few young people of any native stock, nearly all immigrants who haven’t figured out its a sham and the priests and bishops don’t believe.  Reeks of Old Man Smell.The good news is; it ends with Biden.

            I agree that most voters are idiots.  Events since c0v1d have made this plain.  I was mad about it for a while too.
But this is the reality and it’s not productive to be mad at reality.  Most people, even people with high IQs, are not independent thinkers.  They can have their political beliefs programmed by those who control a majority of the media and academy.
We need to be the programmers.  Yes, that’s easier said than done, but I don’t see an alternative.

        Biden will not likely be removed. I have been saying it for years, and I still stand by it. As to the tax return stuff, nothing will come of it. I think more people here need to get on twitter to realize how delusional the right is. All they talk about is how the tide is turning and they are winning the cultural war. Absolutely deluded fools. Props to Z, btw – apropos of his comments about a week ago (how the left defines themselves out of hatred for dirt people), budweiser donated 100000 to some trannie organization a day or two later. Hilarious. Yeah, the right is really winning… The Biden doc stuff is just to keep the right engaged by feeling that the tide is about to turn. They have been putting carrots like this on a stick for dumbasses for quite a while now.

        There is precedent for this charade. Truman was a machine politician who was hand-picked to succeed FDR when they needed to replace the pinko Wallace. Now obviously Wallace was a brilliant, accomplished man whom could never be compared to the courtesan Kamala. And he was very popular too. But they gritted their teeth and booted him anyway.So this is likely what will happen. The blacks have nowhere else to go and it could be argued that they wanted Biden and got him (remember the SC primary episode). Therefore, they cannot complain if she has to be sacrificed in his interests. Nobody likes her anyway and the California people will get Newsom to guard their interests.The womyn will all complain for a few minutes then they will all start drooling over Newsom. The blacks will be promised reparations in a second Biden term as compensation for Harris. Personally, I think the FBI leak to Grassley is just a reminder to Dr Jill that they have leverage over them and they are going to be forced to follow instructions. Grassley is more concerned about ethanol and hogs and has presided over plenty of travesties, including failure to repeal Obamacare.

            Reading that incredibly mangled quote in context, it appears there is a plan for the United States to be involved in some sort of transcontinental railroad across Africa.  That is more frightening than Biden actually running his own administration.  Who came up with this crazy idea and how do they propose to not only build it but keep it functioning?

                There’s no way to know for sure. You’ve cobbled together something that’s actually slightly less crazy (but still crazy) from that talk and I think that’s giving Biden too much credit.
I mean, he said from Pacific to Indian Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean ain’t anywhere near Africa.
But, being charitable, the fact that we’re building infrastructure projects — railroads and solar farms — in Africa when we’re deep in debt at home is just infuriating.

                    I would suggest what’s likely a correction. Strike“building infrastructure projects — railroads and solar farms — in Africa”Replace with (suggested):“providing funding and materials ostensibly to build railroads and solar farms in Africa. Most of the money will be unaccounted for, and what materials do arrive at the destination will be sold for what they will bring.”

                    Sub it out to the Chinese? Already been tried. Perhaps they’re having some successes, but you would not know it if this movie is half true.
The documentary “Empire of Dust” (2011), chronicles the travails of the ironically named Chinese Railway Engineering Company (belt and road guys). There’s a scene where they’re driving along a disused stretch of track, idle since Belgium handed the keys to the locals ca. 1960. The Chinese makes some critical comment about how the natives let the line slip into disrepair.

            When I heard about the Poopy Joe Interoceanic Railroad “project” that’s in the works, something about this particular sentence of incoherent mumbling struck me as something more than a newly gifted punch line to the ongoing joke, more than the random psychosis of an entirely worn out and lost mind (what little was there in the first place.  I believe this particular remark of pure brilliance reflects an actual dream of the top-level managers of the Globohomo Empire, something it/they actually want, built-out and routinized connections across oceans.I know, I know, nobody’s developing plans to lay railroad track across any ocean, the mumblings of a man who never even knows where he is, doesn’t know today’s Thursday, etc. notwithstanding.  Still, Globohomo is essentially the actual realization of “Oceania” in 1984, which Orwell foresaw yet not in its finer, more rarified globohomo details.  An interoceanic railroad would actually be great for Globohomo, very helpful in its perpetual contesting and warring with Eurasia and Eastasia.  The good news for our beloved managers is that, per their official Globohomo Managerialist Instruction Manual (e.g. Orwell’s 1984), nothing has to be true, or even make sense or be possible.  I suspect at a very deep subterranean mental level, albeit entirely subconscious, subsentient even, Poopy Joe is entrained with this overall picture.  Thus, his absurd ramblings, while funny, were not entirely random, not pure unattached comedy of error.Putting this all together, it thus behooves the Ministry of Truth to get cracking on this one, post haste!  Globohomo is at war with Eurasia!  Globohomo has always been at war with Eurasia!  Opposing the Great Globohomo Interoceanic Railroad is though crime of the worst kind, which requires immediate reeducation at the Ministry of Love.

        “Biden decides to drop out of the race.”  – This is where the Jill Biden problem comes in.  She likes being exactly where she is, and has tolerated her dunce of a husband for years with his showering with his daughter, etc. ,to be exactly where she is.  The thing about women is that once they’re used to their comforts having to “downscale” becomes as easy as walking a feral cat on a leash.  I believe this audio-tape situation is the DNC fighting with Jill and proving that they control the FBI not her.  Privately they’re saying “Jill!  It’s over.”

            I think you’ve analyzed it.  Jill was always the scheming power, more pull in D.C. than Tater Joe.  Jilly has plenty of dirt to shovel on The Big Man if he becomes frisky and non-compliant.
Spot on about female nature.  Jilly will fight tooth and claw to retain her position of summa social superiority and privilege, Grand Dame of Goddess Columbia’s District.
Plenty have groveled and genuflected to The First Lady during Tater’s career, and she digs it the most!   lol   Social-ladder scheming and infighting is what makes Western women tick.  Or mebbe ticks.

        Nobody remembers this, but Sleepy Joe was doing awful in the primaries – Kamala was doing even worse – until South Carolina. This was the last time I followed regime news to any extent, and they were all saying that Biden was “strong” in SC with the black vote (remember Corn Pop?) and was expected to win, and win he did. Then the Democrat field mysteriously cleared. Regime media was saying that the Dems couldn’t afford a bitter primary battle, and needed a united front and a candidate who could reasonably beat Trump. Every other Dem was a newbie or risky. Bernie who?This sure looked like the old-style smoke-filled back-room dealmaking. The regime press was carrying on like it was the people’s choice, but Biden wasinstalled. Anyone with their head actually outside of their ass could see that.This was in March 2020, before Covid and before Floyd, and before mail-in ballots were even on the radar. I think the Dems were just stupid. Deep-state actors knew they could control both Trump or Biden, according to their manifest faults. Then events (“events, my dear friend, events”) conspired to help the Dems and Biden do the shenanigans they ended pulling off.

            The Dems 2020 primary pre Covid was a total mess.  Iowa Democrats had a total fiasco with their caucus and never did declare a winner.  Biden finished a distant fifth in New Hampshire after getting no better than fourth in the Iowa mess.  It was similar to how Jeb started in 2016.  He got 2nd in Nevada, but Bernie had a huge win there.  Then James Clyburn declares he has endorsed Biden and all of the sudden the race is over.As to why they selected Biden there only other believable options were Elizabeth Warren and Mayor Pete. As he has proven since then, he is even a bigger zero than Harris.  I am sure they had doubts they could keep Warren on script as she is an insane harpy.  Biden is much easier to manipulate, his grandkids convinced him in Obama’s right side of history and Joe thinks he is going down in history as the Lincoln of the alphabet soup movement for giving them his complete support.  There seems to be a fair amount of fighting behind the scenes to take Joe’s place at the top.  None of this seems well planned or thought out.  People forget Bloomberg thought he was simply going to show up on Super Tuesday in 2020 and be declared the nominee of a party he had recently joined.

                There was a moment when a number of other billionaires looked at Trump and thought “if he can do it I can do it too.” Bloomberg was the one who showed the rest of them that there’s a little more to it than just a being a billionaire.

        Who is going to replace Joe though? They don’t have one.Gavin Newsome is probably the best option, but he is a white male. And a competent white male, not a humiliating old man like Joe. At this point I’m not sure that even being an ultra woke, Trudeau-esque psychopath is enough to counteract the lack of diversity as a straight white male. His competency is probably seen as a threat by Washington.Kamala is a non starter, I would be shocked if she is ever put in as President. Bitchy DMV lady / whore would have every single American ally running for the exits. It would be like Obama’s lecture to the Brits about Brexit backfiring. The market for the cool black guy doesn’t exist outside of America and Kamala is not even a cool guy.RFK is another white male, and a Kennedy. Back to 1960 for an elite that constantly live in the past. He came out of nowhere, said some anti vax stuff, but basically tows the party line on everything else. Probably just an astroturfed Democrat to shore up blue collar union support.The rest of the Dems are geriatric and white. Hispanics are no longer a reliable (enough) partner in the hate-whitey coalition as their numbers grow, I don’t think we will ever see a President Garcia. They will never let an East Asian near the presidency despite Asian Americans fervent support for the Globohomo class.Will they turn to an Indian like the British Isles have done? That really seems like the only option for the ruling class. Perfectly loyal to the elites, not overly hated by any group, too weak of a home country to colonize the USA unlike China (for now), brown, at least semi competent, capable of diplomacy.Therefore I suspect that the next president will be an Indian that they find somewhere. Let’s see.

                We’re all assuming competency matters, and that is no sure thing in this day and age. If competency mattered, after all, diversity would not be AINO’s national religion.

            “…too weak of a home country to colonize the USA…”But the home country need not be strong for colonization of AINO. Depending on what you meant by that statement exactly, Mexico is pretty weak… but look at AINO’s southern border!Similarly, here in the UK, we’re overrun in certain parts by Bangladeshis, Pakistanis and Indians.Seems as though if a country craves diversity enough, they’ll find a way to bring it home. I guess in the sense that China has a strong leadership and would be able to exercise some control over  “Chinese-Americans” your comment is correct? But I may have misunderstood entirely!Either way though, you end up with more diversity in what used to be “your country”.

                I am more so referring to direct colonization by a foreign nation than population replacement.
For example, China buying up Canadian mines, China owning a milk factory in Ontario shipping everything back to China, China opening CCP police stations, China building Chinese only condos, China laundering foreign money through the housing market, etc. These are all real examples.
India is not capable of doing this at the moment, instead they are just dumping their excess population in the West which is turning us into India.
Maybe distinction without difference, but for the ruling class it seems to matter.

                        I’d say India more than China, a lot more.
Indians swarm at the middle class / managerial level; the Chinese go big corp-orate or academic, and are thus more of a threat to the ruling class.

                Don’t confuse our Southern border neighbor, MX with our current influx of IA’s.  The majority of crossers are now termed “OTM”—Other Than Mexican—and have been for a number of years.  Albeit, the majority of current resident “migrants” are of Mexican heritage, the got over here long ago.Basically, MX dumped their unwanted here long ago.  Now we have the rest of Central and South America coming over.  But wait, there’s more!  Seems we have Chinese and Africans now increasing in numbers at the Southern border.  Blacks have paid to be dumped in South America and then the governments down there pay for them to go to MX just to get rid of them.And so it goes….

                    A few months ago there were reports about many American Whites, mostly from Southern California, moving to Mexico because of the lower housing prices.
Since America is getting swamped with newcomers from Central and South America, along with Africans, Indians and Chinese and more, producing a chaotic mish-mash population, perhaps it would be better to live in certain parts of Mexico where you’re among just Mexicans and White newcomers?

                        I’ve never lived there but in the 2000s was interested enough to take about a half dozen trips into Latin America (mostly Mexico, as it’s the most popular) in large part to feel out the retirement possibilities. At the time (my late 40s) I decided against, but who knows?The problem with a large expat Anglo community is that it drives local wages. Thus, the expected savings isn’t as great. Too, having most of your social circle being other aging Anglos is a blessing or a curse, depending on your view I guess.As one travel writer put it, the main attraction of relocating to Mexico seems to be alcohol and servants.In a perverse way, one thing you can say in favor of Latino “democracy” is that money talks. Bribery and favoritism is much more open.

            One problem with the Indian scenario though, everyone hates the Indians they deal with. There are more and more of them in my industry and they are uniformly crappy to deal with in person or any other way. Plus their general lack of honesty and ethics is a red flag.
So I think that for that to happen it would take more reinforcing democracy than may be possible. No offense to any subcontinental but they’re just not very likeable.

        Yes, Joe Normie will remain on the couch no matter how outrageously the Deep State subverts the will of the people. But there are two important consequences to this usurpation. The first is that the spring winds tighter and suppressed public anger eventually explodes. The second is that the Elites must keep the plates spinning in order to forestall this explosion. Which brings us back to Ukraine and the row of dominoes.When Ukraine loses, the USA/EU/NATO will be revealed as a paper tiger and the rest of the planet will abandon ship. As a result, money printing can no longer rescue a faux economy and recession (more likely depression) will trigger a collapse much like the Soviet Union in 1991. The Cloud People intend to use this turmoil to foment pleb-on-pleb violence and enable a jackboot fueled tyranny to arise (Bolshevik Revolution redux). Will it work?The models say that secession and militia movements will be much more powerful than DC comprehends and the country will fracture before the jackboots can tame the resistance. But unfortunately, as in Ukraine currently, there will be a lot of dead innocents and alphas before the smoke clears.There is a better way.

            The Treasury Secretary for GAE cam out and said that they shouldn’t defend the dollar.  I have to wonder though if she actually knows the impact of what she said, stuff like that usually doesn’t slow-boil away.

                My take is Yellen was signaling that just as civil rights have been stripped, economic prosperity is about to go away. She also may be shilling for China, but it appears her Tribe and the PRC are at odds.
I suspect to make way for CBDC the dollar has to be rendered either worthless or less valuable.

            That sounds about right. Murdoch likely has a modus vivendi with Newsome and Hannity obviously will do anything he is ordered to do. I don’t do cable so will watch that on YT or Rumble.

        They knew that they were going to win in 2020 with mail in voting. They just needed a candidate that people didn’t hate more than Trump, would be fine with white women and blacks and would do whatever the rulers wanted. Biden checked those boxes.
2024 they are again guaranteed victory. I imagine they want Biden in again so they don’t have to run with Harris. If she mysteriously dies it is likely a sign they are going to run with Newsom.

        I think many are ignoring the easiest solution to The Cloud People’s predicament with FJB, “Heels-up” Kamala, and the group that both Republican and Democrat insiders absolutely despise, their MAGAts.
All they need to do is make sure something happens to both Joe and Kamala at the same time, have their MAGA patsies, then implement a total crackdown on anyone who supports Donald Trump.
The next president I think could well be someone lower on the totem pole of presidential succession.

        I find it amusing Trump didn’t really have that aging so many presidents in my lifetime have gone through.  Unlike most of the presidents in my lifetime, Trump had an actual job before running. He was used to the long hours and lack of sleep from going to bed late and waking up early.

                “Trump would wither and die within a year if he was forced to retire from the spotlight. Say what you want, but the man lives to fight.”Hard disagree.Running your mouth endlessly is not fighting.  Its a shame the right can’t see through that.The only thing Trump has going for him is an addiction to self-promotion and the spotlight.  Its a weird form of energy like what the autistic kids have who play World of Warcraft for 48 hours straight.Most normal people wouldn’t have the stamina for it, but just because someone is able to do some unusually well, doesn’t make what they are doing useful or healthy.Outside of Trumps special interest of self-promotion, he is a profoundly lazy and complacent man when it comes to accomplishing anything of substance.

        Alternative explanation: this is also a hit on the FBI, which has gotten too big for its britches. Maybe the Bureau simply couldn’t destroy the evidence due to known and unobtainable back-ups? The recordings of the bribe conversations easily could have numerous copies. The FBI has fought tooth and nail not to release anything and the stonewalling seems legitimate. The Regime may have decided to neuter the Praetorian Guard for any number of reasons. This is how totalitarian states work–one faction offs or neutralizes the other when it feels threatened or deems it necessary.As for Biden, there may be a grand bargain in the works: he goes if Trump goes. Obviously, the latter has no institutional power, including a party apparatus behind him, but it would make for nice kabuki and pave the way for nominees acceptable to the Regime.All said and done, though, it is now obvious 2016 was the last hoorah for the Grand Old Party. The base hates the party enough to stay home. That is not about to change. It is laughable to think such an authoritarian Regime as this one would allow a viable third party, so the Republicans will stick around and do what they do best, which is strut on the stage, signifying nothing, full of sound and fury, crying “next time, we swear!” Enough dullards still will vote to give at least the patina of legitimacy to the Regime.The unraveling of the GAE will continue unabated and will be quite the spectacle to behold, and that assumes it does not cause us all to die of radiation poisoning before the curtain falls.

            I agree. The symbolism of Biden is identical to the symbolism of Yeltsin. It is the same people who had Boris propped up and who animate the corps of Biden. This is both getting whatever you want out of the regime with zero oversight, and an intentional message of humiliation to our people – ‘White man, your time is up.’Every single optic in politics is thoroughly thought through and carefully packaged to send the precise message that those with power want to send.As for the Senatorial dog and pony shows, where is the outrage at the invasion at the border? Oh wait, they just handed sanctuary cities $143 billion to pay for migrant entrenchment programs. Looks like Adams and the PA regime will have plenty more money to loot and many more bonuses to pay to keep their mobs primed.Welcome to the third world.

                Yeltsin did one really good thing for his country.  He recognized the talent of a young lawyer and eventually made him Prime Minister.  Putting Putin in power saved Russia from being thoroughly looted and maybe broken up by the west.

No.  Been an insider all his life, talks populism but never lived it, that’s why he caved at the end.Most of the Dem reaction to Donald’s admin was theater arranged for maximum capitalization p.r. on their outrage.  They are experts at making the most of outrage and hysteria.

        “The presidency is a fulltime job that requires long hours even for a puppet.”I think Reagan, particularly during his second term, was not putting in more than three hours a day. But Biden is far beyond Reagan in decrepitude and loss of mental faculties.I’ve no idea what’s going on. Perhaps some boneheaded obstinacy of Team Biden to run for a second term, which will come a cropper as the people who really matter in the ruling junta decide to boot out his rotting carcass. The bribery issue has always been Damocles’ sword hanging over Biden and it would be a convenient way of booting him out.

                And don’t forget it’s “Professor” Joe Biden:
“According to the tax forms he has released, Biden received more than $900,000 from the university for holding the position between 2017 and 2019. His post “involved no regular classes and around a dozen public appearances on campus, mostly in big, ticketed events,” the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.”

That’s true for most everyone except purely clerical staff. Once you hit the middle ranks, it all becomes a masquerade. And that masquerade can be more enervating than real work. These white-collar jobs are what Graeber calls “bullshit jobs.”

            Arshad Ali: “I think Reagan, particularly during his second term, was not putting in more than three hours a day.”
The Bush family crime syndicate was able to launch a bullet that grazed a rib, lodged in his lung [which partially collapsed], and came to rest a mere 25mm from his heart.
That would tend to slow down most men in their seventies.

Indeed.
Whatever the reasoning of the “higher-ups”, “clouds” or “elites”, ultimately Satan has their souls and their work is aligned with the destruction attendant with Devilry. Evil is what it is.
We know it is a very grave situation. We see the consequences of Evil, destructive policies everyday with our own eyes.

        As democracy bevomes less democratic. Would be interesting to see if some elites find value in breaking ranks and start running for populist appeal.  Amazing as it sounds, I would argue people like Musk and Bezos hate the common man far less than your average republican representative.  Zuckerberg showed how much damage a rich elite can do and unfortunately used it as a regime toady, as he is a spiritual midget.As Washington D.C forgoes even the facade of representation, maybe people will wisen up and find representation in other ways. As Washingtons rule becomes more arbitrary, a lot of the upper classes will look to a new system to assure at least a modicum of fairness instead of worrying some jackal at the FBI has a personal grudge against him. Mass appeal is not as powerful as one might think, but can tip the scales when wielded properly.

            Hate to say it, but I think you’re wrong about Bezos.  Remember a couple of years ago when William Shatner actually went into orbit in one of Bezos’ rockets?  I don’t know if you’ve seen the video of the aftermath, but there’s a clip of Shatner talking to Bezos about how amazing the whole thing was.  Shatner was almost literally tearing up over the experience.  Bezos was just standing there like “Whatever, old man!”  and just a couple of minutes into the chat he basically said “I got to talk to those people over there.” and just walked away.If he can’t even hide his disdain of Captain Kirk himself, I seriously doubt he has the slightest respect for the common man.

                RDittmar,I agree completely. There is something about Bezos and Musk that gives me the creeps. It also clear that they are Godless Technologists, so good luck with leaders like that.Perhaps Bezos would love a world where we pay for our goods with chips implanted into our wrists, or where we’re all hooked up to Hawking’esque wheelchairs with the voicebox and everything… no need to doanything, tech’ll do it for you!In the end all solutions (if there are any) and significant activity will need to be based on local loyalties. Blood and sweat and, of course, God. No human will come to save us – of that I’m convinced. Certainly not Bezos or Musk. May the Good Lord have mercy on our utter deviancy and straying from His Word.Christian awakening of the individual and within His family is, to my mind, the core of any meaningful resistance. All of this requires a compleat 180 regarding Normie’s thinking. That may happen or it may not.

                    My quibbles about accuracy aside, that’s the way it works.When the Templars arise, is the Coming of the Lord.  It is a tide, no man alone can stand against it.(Yea, our Nation is the Lord, just as theirs is the Antichrist, the Mosiach. Archetypes don’t refer to a concrete entity, but to the Spirit in a people. I will not bow to theirs.)But I must warn you, in your desperation!Remember Who suborned you before, and how they did it.Blame the women, the kids, the potheads, the niggras, the fags, the foreigns–The Amalek, the Edomites, the Israelites-But it was you, YOU, who allowed these creatures in that they might throw open the gates–You who demanded that all accept their sermons, their values, their false promises, that you might do rightly.They promised you…God’s love.Whose God?As if you did not have it already.The only way to prevent the Deceiver’s temptation, of false love, of false peace, of false goodness, of a reward they cannot deliver-Is to say in your hearts, “Jesus the King is White!”—-—-I know your retort- but Creation is the power above God, above all the gods, even Abraham’s, even our own Christ.Who created God?In serving Christ, you serve Creation.

                Musk too only shows minimal attachment to real life. The amount of credit we give him for his *slight* embrace of the “logicked!”/DR3 part of American conservatism… Everyone else who’s like that, we know they’re morons. Over-under on Musk’s IQ is 102.At the risk of making a libertarian essay (Hayek’s “The Intellectuals and Socialism”) seem correct, it really does injure my soul to know that all our oligarchs are fucking idiots. They weren’t always. There’s a very deep new flaw in the world. And because of it I reject all actual existing social “hierarchy” and can’t believe any righty embraces it. Taylor Lorenz and Prince Harry are your rightful lords? You’re not even human.

        I think Biden is being run again in order to get rid of Kamala.He’ll pick a new VP who will then become president in 2014.
The problem with him dropping out before or during the primaries is that Kamala will be the heir apparent – and they’ll have to expend time and effort to get rid of her.  She’s not going to be shamed or talked into walking away.  And she does have powerful backers in the dem party – maybe for the same reason that othwrs backed Biden.

            Two possible scenarios that I see: get rid of KH in the VP slot, replace with Gavin Newsom, who will become Pres when Biden either dies or is forced out in second term; or, Biden drops out and/or dies just before convention. Party picks either Newsom or Michael Obama to run for Pres.

                It wouldn’t be surprising if Newsome said that he’d take the job so long as he didn’t have to campaign for it.  He saw what happened to Harris and although he’s much more talented than she is he has about the same amount of appeal in non-costal areas and probably couldn’t even beat Biden in an unrigged fight.

            Kamala has backers? For POTUS?I think at one time she did, but her utter incompetence at executing the powerless job that is VPOTUS has probably shed them all. She’s a terrible campaigner to boot (wasn’t she the first one to drop out in 20? awful close anyway); if the DNC tells her, “Time’s up, you’re not getting put on the 24 ticket, top or bottom,” there’s nobody riding to her rescue.I think DNC wants Newsom, but they can’t figure out how to crack Biden’s thick skull and make him just go away. I just sit back with the popcorn.

                    Ah, yes!  Silicon Valley are the bubble billionaires who backed Obama and built his new machine atop the Clinton machine he worked for.
He usurped an already corrupt machine- we are seeing classic usurpation at play, with the Praetorians weighing in, seizing their chance to be undisputed King of the hill.
Meanwhile, external outcountry powers are reacting to the disarray, some scheming and plotting.
