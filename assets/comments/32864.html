        In the past year, it seems like the entire system just gave up on the pretense that it works for and represents Americans. It’s more obvious than ever that we are Norman England, in that a hostile foreign group rules over us and uses our resources to enrich themselves and advance their own, alien interests. Netanyahu’s speech in Congress and “our” representatives’ response to it might be a low point in the history of this nation.This is why I can’t get behind Trump, how can I realistically vote for a guy who is pushing for total war with Iran, who said Israel is “too small” and “was maybe the greatest country”, who simps for Miriam Adelson in a way that is just unimaginable to anyone who supported the guy in 2016. It’s just embarrassing but he’s said it so much I have to listen.

            Wish I could give you more than one “thumbs up” for refusing to support Trump. Trump is a completely faux anti-establishment figure — as evidenced by the fact that he is even more establishment than the establishment itself in regard to the ridiculously beloved Israel. We should end this whole ruse of allowing Americans (rubes, nearly one and all) to vote and permit Israel to choose our elected puppets outright. It would be more honest.

                Note: not one senator or congressman even bothered to try to refute Massie’s revelation that each one had an Israeli minder. More telling, the propaganda organs didn’t bother, either.

                    Excellent point. The masks have come off with regard to how sycophantic the situation is. Nobody bothers to deny the obvious. Hell, AIPAC openly boasts about how it owns practically 100 percent of Congress.
“Chutzpah” ain’t a Hebrew term for nothing!

                    Massie is pretty cagey himself. When challenged about his opposition to aid for Israel, he insists he has nothing against Israel, he just does not support financial aid to any foreign country. If he ever denounced Israel outright as a murderous, aggressive ethno-state,  the gloves would come off and he might even end up deceased.

                Reminds me of an old joke. Why does Israel steadfastly refuse to become our 51st state? Because then they’d have only TWO U.S. Senators!

                “de Wessyington” Point being, I don’t know how you separate the Norman from the English. Romano-Britons, Anglo-Saxons, Celts. Mutts in the best sense. And then Americans, of course.

                Establishment Republicans think he’s antisemitic too, because his enthusiasm for the death of Americans is limited. Grudgingly pro-Trump media Republicans—Jewish and culturally Jewish—think he’ssecretlyantisemitic and dread the moment he drops the not-Hitler mask and unleashes the MAGA nazi horde. Republicans who weren’t in on the plot(s) watching January 6th thought that’s what was happening. That’s the illusory “terrorism” that, e.g., Ted Cruz condemned.Trump may have believed it too.As our guys say, an antisemite is someone Jews hate. Numbers are bullshit, but I’ve seen it claimed that Trump’s share of the Jewish vote has been the lowest of any Republican in history. That fits what we see. Except for stinky-hat New Yorkers and rustic Israeli weirdos, they all hate him insanely. And he has no idea. If Jewish comedy were still a thing, SNL Trump’s hook would how mad he makes Jews by ass-kissing them—and, especially, by offering friendly advice—while they seethe murderously.

            Trump’s avowed and appalling love for murderous Zion, however, may not change his general love for peace over war…He’s spouting this nonsense because he needs to appease the Zionists tp get elected, and maybe to stay alive, but I very much doubt that he, or the American public, will go along with WWIII, which would obviously destroy the USA….

                Like I said, at some point I have to take him at his word. And if he is saying this because he wants to stay alive, what is going to happen to him if turns his back on them when he gets into office?
I think the simplest explanation – he feels like he needs to get into office to get the blob off his back (lawfare, etc.), and he cut a deal with the Zionists to get it – is the appropriate one, as opposed to this logic about him being secretly based or just lying or whatever.

                ^This. Records matter. We don’t have to speculate about Trump because we had 4 years of Trump who, among other things,Iraq/Afghanistan drawdownsRefused to enter Syrian civil warDestroyed ISIS (after we were told it couldn’t be done)No new M.E. warsAbraham AccordsSuccessful oil price war against the Saudis/OPECI remember a lot of the same commentary on this blog back when he said he wanted to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. We got a lot of arm waiving and hysteria back then, too. But what did we get in exchange for that symbolic promise?Trump won because a lot of the evangelical Christians decided to throw in with him.And we got 4 years of peace and stability in the region.  And we got a POTUS who refused to go along with the b.s. neocon warmongering.We know 100% for sure what happens if Trump loses. They’re already telling us what they have planned –War with Iran next yearWar with China in 2027Expansion of the war with RussiaYou can sit it out if you like, but the enemies of everything decent in the world are still going to come to our homes, take our kids, and ship them off to fight these wars.

                        Definitely a team effort.  Those unspoken team-ups can do a lot of good when done right.  Naturally, we paid them back the way the GAE pays back everyone else – by f&amp;&amp;&amp;ing them over in Ukraine.
It’s a mad mad mad mad mad world.

                        Unfortunate, but true.  However, I see glimmers of hope in the recent war because the bought-and-paid-for politicians have had a helluva time trying to convince the public go to along with this nonsense.
Did they do it anyway?  Yes, but it was hardly the cakewalk of past misadventures.  I think the public has gotten wise the the scheme on both sides of the ball.

                                I don’t know yet.  Maybe nothing.  So far people have been willing to hide behind the fig leaf of voting.  “Oh well, we lost, the other side gets to do what they want…”
It does make you wonder just how long the fake elections can go on before people either do something or just stop participating in them.

                “but I very much doubt that he, or the American public, will go along with WWIII,”
Nobody asked our opinions on the subject.  They aren’t in the slightest bit interested in any opinions we may have.  We are entirely irrelevant in their decision making and will do what we are told if the decision is made to go to war.

                    Long as the white man has an ample supply of bourbon, brisket and ball, he won’t object to his little Kayleb getting blown to bits in the Golan Heights on behalf of Omer. That’s a rough take on my part, but I wouldn’t have posted it if I didn’t believe it.

                    There was a very strong isolationist movement in this country—including Congress—prior to Dec 7, 1941.  Indeed, it kept us out of war for two years while the world burned.  FDR was flummoxed until he devised a way to provoke first attack.  At that point, the country fell into line.  As Goring said:“Naturally, the common people don’t want war; neither in Russia, nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.”And so it will be here with the first use of nukes.

                        Agreed, except for the nukes part.  The leadership can avoid the consequences of war for the most part.  It is the common man who is made to sacrifice.  While sugar and gasoline and many other things were tightly rationed in WW2, the leadership wanted for nothing.  The rations were ridiculous.  Everyone was driving on bald tires because you simply couldn’t get them.  There were replacement parts shortages for most cars.  This did not affect the leadership.The consequences for a nuclear war will not allow this.  Consequences will be felt by everyone without exception.  Consequences are for the rubes.  While they may escape the worst of the consequences (whatever gas is left will be for them), most of the consequences will be felt by everyone regardless of station in life.

                            One needs to define nuke war.  There are tactical nukes and strategic nukes.  Small vs large is one way to look at it.  Targeting, another.  I’m not convinced—short of targeting civilian population centers—that use of nukes in the field comes immediately home as use of nukes against population centers—not in the case of the Middle East.We seem to be taking scenarios out of context from the Cold War, where indeed the two major powers threatened population centers and each belligerent was held “hostage” by the other.The fly in the ointment is Israel with a nuke arsenal who could join in the mix to do a false flag operation to get things escalating.  We know they are capable of doing this because they are fanatics in the cause of Israel and have threatened to take down everyone else if threatened with (conventional) destruction by surrounding enemies.  After the USS Liberty incident, I could image them sending one over to the US or NATO allies.

                                If it’s just “tactical” then I mostly agree with you.  But with Israel, there is no tactical nuclear weapon use.Whether or not you take seriously the “Samson” option, that could easily lead to an exchange of strategic nuclear weapons.  Frankly, I really don’t buy the Samson option.We don’t have any examples of tactical nukes ever being used.  I’m not sure if a war can go nuclear and remain only tactical uses of nuclear weapons.They largely were not aimed at cities to keep the citizenry under blackmail, but because the cities were where the industrial (and thus military) power was centered.  This is largely no longer the case in the US.  What industrial power we have is no longer in the cities.  Most of our cities are just hellholes.

                                    Who has the tech to send nukes to US soil?  Russia, China, maybe North Korea.  So how does this escalate to total annihilation? If nukes used in conflict are geared toward military objectives, you still have a stalemate of sorts.  Use them against population centers, then retaliation becomes the name of the game.

            Nice analogy.It was the Norman’s in 1080 or so who imported the jews into England because they        would collect taxes on the English in ways Christians would not. They stayed until expelled by Longshanks in 1290. Edward I also fucked over Mel  Gibson of course.

        Israel is one of the worst countries on the planet, and I am enjoying watching them become a pariah on the global stage.  As recently as five years ago was mostly indifferent to Israel, but now I openly despise that country because of the ways they’ve manipulated and subverted both foreign and domestic policy in the West.  While I don’t go as far as supporting Iran, I wouldn’t shed any tears if Iran put Israel in its place.  My only fear is that our leaders will drag us into yet another unwinnable war in the Middle East.  The tension between Israel and Iran is escalating to an incredibly dangerous level, and threatens to unleash calamities upon the world that haven’t been seen in 80 years.  I hope I’m wrong about all this, but given the feckless, childish leaders in charge in the west, and the fanatics running things in Israel, cooler heads prevailing probably isn’t the way to bet.

            I have not seen many spectacles more bizarre than Netanyahu’s address to Congress in July. He got 58 standing ovations. Fifty-eight! That’s probably more than one a paragraph. The next time he does it, they’ll have to do what the Soviets helpfully did during Stalin’s speeches and ring a bell to let everyone know they can stop clapping. Even then, I doubt the commies fawned over Joe as slavishly as all those freaks and cretins did over ole ‘Bibi’.It was genuinely creepy to watch the supposed leaders of America perform like trained seals at the behest of a country incomparably smaller and punier.

                    Democracy is only possible in relatively small, ethnically and religiously homogeneous societies where there is a broad ethical consensus. Otherwise it is a sham, full of preening and posturing to claim the moral high ground for one’s own interests, which are never admitted, except perhaps privately among the oligarchs who really decide matters.
Z had a great tweet this weekend about how even the ancient Greeks used religious drama to reinforce the regime and its moral order.
Not coincidentally, I think he was watching football commercials.

                        Mass democracy merely allows the economic oligarchs to control the system by financing the campaigns of the politicians. You then get legislation written by lobbyists (a routine practice in Washington). A real democracy (e.g., ancient Athens) would appoint legislators by lot, to  prevent the oligarchs from controlling the system. As you point out, such a system only works on a small scale.

                The biggest claim against Saddam was the threat of him becoming Middle East Mustache Man, with the ghost of Neville Chamberlain haunting the west’s every move at the time.  There were still a lot of WWII vets at the time so the marketing plan had serious hooks.

                    Saddam was our boy for years. A secular dictator who opposed Islamic extremists and Iran. Getting rid of him was nuts. He was hated by Israel and Saudi Arabia, which I suspect had a lot to do with Bush’s decision to get rid of him.

            It had less to do with creating a “democracy” and more to do with creating bases along the Iranian border from which to launch operations inside Iran.The Wizards of Smart just never accepted the fact that half of Iraq was just fine with Iran, about 1/4 of Iraq wanted to go to war with Turkey/Syria, and about 1/4 of Iraq that remained was loyal to the Baath regime.If you dropped a piece of plate glass flat onto concrete and looked at the shattered bits, you’d get a rough approximation of the national borders and tribalism of the Middle East.  The Wizards of Smart looked at the maps of the region – which have been redrawn hundreds of times over many centuries – as static borders containing common people.The problem we have is that these people just aren’t that smart.  They THINK they’re smart because they all agree with each other that they’re smart.  And when things go to hell, well, that’s just the way things go sometimes.

        Israel’s psychotic behaviour is not surprising when you realise that the country is led by the psychological offspring of the Stern Gang and Irgun, some of the most deranged freaks in a century when there was some competition. In 1942, the only thing that stood between the Germans and Palestine was the British Army, but the Zealots decided that the British were the real enemy. So, they mounted a terrorist campaign against them and made them look over their shoulders when Rommel was at El Alamein. Pure insanity of course, but insanity that has, via Likud and the neocon diaspora, made itself into American foreign policy.

        “It is a good reminder that everyone involved in Middle East politics is incapable of honesty.”In the Middle East only the Israelis are incorrigible liars. Not the Iranians, not Hezbollah, not Hamas. And among the Israelis, first and foremost is Netanyahu, who learnt to lie at the same time he learnt to talk. In the West, US and European government officials are liars, lying both to the world at large but also to their domestic populations. The real life consequences of this mendacity are going to be escalation, war, the end of US influence in the Middle East, and ten dollar gasoline. As in multiple prior cases, the perpetrators will escape scot-free.

                    True. But domestic Hebes ain’t the same thing as Israel. In fact, a very high percentage of Leftist radical Finkels in AINO loathe Israel because they consider it a Western colonial state that oppresses the swarthy saints (Palestinians). And it’s those Finkels, not the Mizrahim, who, along with the deranged Puritans, are at the forefront of perversity and diversity on the homefront.

                            My eyes were opened watching a Bourdain show from Lebanon. He was spending time and eating with a Lebanese Christian family. They kept AKs at home in case they were needed against an Israeli invasion. As a group they hated and feared Israel and were supportive of Hezbollah. As far as I know, Hezbollah never has bothered Christians in Lebanon and has defended them as fellow Lebanese. Who’s the enemy here?

                            At the Latin Mass I attended in the early 90’s, one of the celebrants’s first “posting” for lack of a better word – was at the Church of The Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem. He spoke of being ridiculed, screamed at, harassed and spit upon by the Israeli population. He went on to say that the Muslims showed him nothing but kindness and respect.

                        It’s a classic pincer move.  Overseas heebs cry as they strike out at others, my showah, my hollow cost, etc. to get you to do their bidding.  The domestic heebs make sure Whites stay outnumbered, dumbed down and demoralized so they don’t turn on the heeb masters.  Any concern for anyone not a heeb is simply feigned.

        Anyone who has never seen the video in which Congressman Traficant stated outright that Israel controls Congress needs to watch it over and over and spread it far and wide.

            In that linked video clip, I especially like the part towards the end where Hannity says, “are you suggesting that Israel controls congress….blah, blah, blah….” Traficant leans in to the camera…”Sean…I’m not suggesting it, I’m telling it…”
And Sean never had Traficant on his show again.  A few years later Traficant died in a farm accident involving his tractor.  A mysterious accident.
For those interested, Devon Stack did a show about Traficant, a guy who ran afoul of the regime.https://odysee.com/@Blackpilled:b/trafic:8

        Over the weekend i tried to explain to some christian zionists that war with Iran is not in our interests and would be risking the lives of our children and grandchildren for Israel. They would have none of it, their noses are so far up  Netanyahu’s arse they are in total darkness. The only way out is a disaster in my opinion.Which we will probably have due to this relationship with the Israeli lobby.

        No Z-Man, with all due respect, both you and Washington are wrong. Washington warned of the attachment or hatred when America was a country. We are not a country. Just a place on the map of the GAE. So our demands and desires and such are radically different as is reflective of our bad situation.We live in a multi-racial, multi-cultural empire where Whites particularly Straight White Males with no power-connections are at the bottom. Even Musk’s money won’t protect him, California is banning his launches over his politics (really) and the Media wants him in jail or deported or both. If we had a 89% White country as in 1960, you would be correct, however we don’t and you are not.And you don’t have (sorry, you are just missing this) a correct handle on how affinity and hostility to Israel breaks out in Washington power structures.Until Clinton, Democrats were friendly to Israel, Republicans hostile: Reagan famously opposed Israel’s raid on Iraqi Osirik reactor where Saddam was enriching nuclear fuel for a bomb, conducting it without notifying the Americans. This changed under the Clintons as the recipe for holding together the anti-White Democratic coalition that really hated Jews (blacks, third world princelings like Obama, etc) with Jews was a rather incoherent doling out goodies to both while not taking much significant action.Bush II in reaction to this partisan choice became the Party of Israel. In reaction to the Clinton slide to anti-Israel (Hillary’s paen to Suha Arafat’s demand to eliminate Jews and Israel world-wide). There was also cynically Jewish donor money to be picked up.Obama put this into overdrive, the official policy of Democrats is PRO IRAN. Let me repeat, PRO IRAN. Obama gave Iran billions in pallets of cash, lifted all sanctions, gave them a green light on nuclear weapons development. This was a direct repudiation of the Carter Doctrine which Reagan and Bush and Clinton and Bush had all confirmed: US military domination of the Gulf, suppression of Iran, and protection of the Gulf Oil Emirates/Kingdoms.This was done primarily for domestic reasons. Under Obama, the final push to eliminate the last bastions of ethnic Whites from Blue urban power centers began. Anglo-Saxon Whites had been pushed out by the 1920s; the Irish by the 1950s, the Italians by the 1960s/1970s, All that remained were Jews, like Albert Shanker, head of the Teacher’s Union in NYC and subject of jokes in Woody Allen’s Sleeper. Jews retained power in places like the Senate (lamentable Chucky Schemer), House, various other places like Academia, and Wall Street. Israel pro/anti was merely a proxy for the struggle by the Coalition of the Diverse to seize the remaining power strongholds.Notably, Obama did little to aid Saudis in the war against the Houthis in Yemen, or crush Iran for violating the Carter Doctrine by adventuring in Yemen against the US/Saudis there. Again, for domestic reasons.Trump naturally put Iran back on the Carter Doctrine, and rebuilt the traditional but unspoken alliance of Israel, the various oil kingdoms, etc. The Biden regime just as naturally put Iran back in good graces, canceled the sanctions, sent more billions, and so on.Then: Oct 7. Which galvanized entirely the anti-Whites in the West. Its why BLM naturally celebrated the glider attacks. Video and images of non-Whites killing Whites, dragging away White (or White-ish) girls to be sex slaves, what is there not to like for anti-Whites? Their fantasies come true. THAT, Oct 7, is what most non-Whites want. In the aftermath of Oct 7, the anti-White coalition, not always led by Muslimas, went into overdrive. In Red States, this was crushed early with many going to jail. In Blue States, not so much. It quickly moved into general attacks on Jewish students on campus to purge them, to install more allied non-Whites. To their horror, Jews are now White because those who define it are non-Whites. A Jewish girl had her skull fractured at UCLA, hence the call out to Jewish fraternities SoCal wide, and the battle of UCLA where the Jewish frat boys went at it against the anti-Whites until finally the cops came in and arrested the anti-Whites. Similar stuff went on at NYU, Columbia, Harvard, Yale, etc.This has led to a crisis in the Democratic Party: they NEED the Jewish donor money, and political leadership and organization, but that conflicts with the anti-White votes which are NOT just Muslims but blacks, various latinos, asians, etc. The leader of the Penn jihad was the daughter of a Filipino billionaire. Which is telling.Strategically it is idiotic to court Iran which is always an anti-American power, the Carter Doctrine made and makes sense because the US depends on cheap oil and energy. However domestic Democratic Interests (Green grifters like Al Gore, etc) want EXPENSIVE energy so they are at war directly with the auto manufacturers, defense industry, etc. over energy being cheap and available or expensive and scarce. So far the Iran-backers wanting ultra expensive Green solar power have won in the Biden Admin, which is why powerful institutions are moving Trump’s way.Its even more complicated as now the neo-cons innate hatred of Russia is transfered to Iran, which has supplied Russia with equipment and drones and other things, and is allied to Russia. THEY (Nuland/Kagan clan and allies like Bolton) want WAR with Iran as a way to get direct War with Russia. Which they think is really weak and all it will take is one big push. They fight against those in the Democratic Party (Obama’s faction, mostly, along with BLM, the Greens, the Clintons) who favor Iran and want to turn over the Gulf to Iran as big local enforcer, to punish White America and make energy ultra expensive.Biden’s Regime as Obama’s Third Term had tried to Color Revolution Israel, get rid of Bibi (who favors Trump), those attempts basically failed after Oct 7 has generally set most of Israel around Bibi’s policies though not his personality. Most Israelis want the Gaza Strip cleared of all Palestinians, same with South Lebanon and Hezbollah, and are not concerned after Oct 7 on how its done. There is effectively no peace movement in Israel at this point.Fundamentally, America’s establishment reflects the racial makeup and balkanization of the GAE, it is split into factions with different strategic desires / outcomes, but overwhelming reflects the politics of either White or anti-White.Note: my own desire would be to let the Israelis and Iranians fight it out, Iran seems to want War and they should get it, good and hard. But no one asked me. I will note that the fragility of the Regime and factionalization would make general War with Iran a possible (not guaranteed) hinge point for the undoing of the GAE as that War would be no more winnable than Russia taking on Japan in the Russo-Japanese War.

        There’s an active debate in alternative media about who really is leading whom in the conduct of American foreign and military policy in the Middle East.  On the one side are, partially and in no particular order, John Mearsheimer and Douglas McGregor, Jeffrey Sachs and Z-man.  They claim that Israel is calling the shots and that Washington is powerless to refuse.  Another view is represented by Gilbert Doctorow, Moon of Alabama, and Brian Berletic.  They believe that the real decisionsarebeing made in Washington, with the objective of ensuring American hegemony in the region and that Israel is merely Washington’s tool.  It’s an interesting debate to watch and I have no way of resolving it.  My only additional observation is that possibly both sides have valid points because there are forces in the American “government” that are working at cross-purposes.  There may well be factions within the CIA, State Department and even the Pentagon that are competing with other factions within the same or even additional agencies.  (At this stage I wouldn’t be surprised if the Department of the Interior is trying to weigh on foreign policy.)  Some of these factions are indeed encouraging Israel to goad Iran into a war so that the US can defeat Iran and establish hegemony.  Other factions are genuinely afraid of a conflict with Iran and enraged that Israel continues to provoke Iran.  Some others may be willing to go to war with Iran, but want to wait until after the election or even the inauguration.  As Z-man has put it more articulately than I can, all of these are signs of a late-stage declining empire.

            Whatever hegemony the USA has in the region is in spite of Israel, not because of it. I don’t see any way that the endless, unconditional support of Israel helps the USA with anybody else in the region, especially since it means that the USA has to essentially bribe other countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt just to play nice with them.The past year, IMO, has shown who is the dog and who is the tail totally and completely. The USA’s continued and baffling support of Israel even as it is turning us into a pariah state alongside them and makes a mockery of the high-minded ideals the GAE claims to exist for proves it without a shadow of a doubt. There is no way anyone could see the display Congress put on before Netanyahu and and determine that it is Congress that is the boss.

            My humble opinion is that it is six (million) of one, half a dozen (million) of the other.  Stateside heebs run the US; israel heebs run israel.  In theory, there could be diverse opinions among the two sets of heebs running both shows, but when that rarely manifests itself it is usually about tactics or timing, not the ultimate goal of heebs running everything.

        who’s to say the iranians don’t have missiles that can reach the continental US?  how hard would it be to get help from the Russians in setting up missile batteries in central america (or cuba)?  and speaking of the Russians, bet they will love helping iran to destroy US troops in israel (or anywhere, really).

                Dropping the grid in AINO would quickly grind things to a halt.
Drive around the AINO countryside and marvel at all the poorly secured infrastructure.
I’m sure all the foreign bad actors that have flooded through out non-existant borders have noticed this situation as well.

                    There are so many “undocumented” people in the US now, people our government knows nothing about, that it’s probably trivial for Russia, Iran, China, etc… to set up sleeper cells just about everywhere who could be mobilized quickly to create all sorts of chaos in the US. Exploiting your enemy’s stupidity and weak points is part of winning any war and this is an easy one to see. Hell, the Mexican cartel soldiers alone would be a devastating force that could probably be mobilized just by paying them. They’ve already got the organization, military explosives, and heavy weapons. Who knows, perhaps this is the real reason the administration didn’t authorize missile strikes into Russia.

                    People say that, but the Ukrainian grid has been under full scale military attack for 2 years and still has like 85% in service.  Even that sounds worse than it actually is.
Just last week we supposedly got hit by the worse CME rating possible, IIRC, it was a category 5.  I didn’t even notice it. No outages at all. Not internet, not radio, not TV, not phone and definitely not electric.
That’s not to say nothing will ever harm the grid, but I think it is more resilient than most people give it credit.

                That is exactly why, I think, the Regime rattles sabers but nothing ever happens. It’s why we never formally declared war on Russia, and why there will never be a war with Iran or China. We’ve allowed a multitude of fifth columns into the “Homeland” as we used to call it.
I don’t think we can even declare a war on El Salvador.

                    Declaration of War is a meaningless holdover from antiquity, the absence of which no longer precludes hostilities between us and other belligerents de jour.  We simply subvert, perhaps escalate to direct or proxy attack, then get the hell out of “Dodge” when the people at home “catch wise”.  Most of the time, we don’t.

        I don’t think a war with Iran will happen because if it did, it would end quickly and fatally for Israel. Russia has provided Iran with a real air defense capability and that guarantees that Iran can and will counter-launch a nation-destroying missile attack on Israel (1,000s of precision-guided ballistic missiles in endless waves). Israel’s energy and fresh water supply systems will cease to exist and that will instigate another Jewish exodus and diaspora. And if Netanahoo goes nuclear, a second Holocaust will follow. Is that a bad outcome or a good outcome? Inquiring minds want to know.

            “Israel’s energy and fresh water supply systems will cease to exist…”What a catch.  One of the real reasons behind the Palestinian problem is the draining of the Palestinian aquifer, been going on for years.  In large part this is a water war.

                I suspect Israel would have little problem with water access as it has 170 miles of coastline.  Saudi Arabia has supplied itself through desalination for decades.  Israel could do the same at a fraction of the cost it’s spending on endless war.

                    A desalination plant takes a fraction of a second to destroy and several years to rebuild. Ditto for the municipal pumping stations. Israel could import gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel once their refineries are gone; but loss of potable water becomes an existential crisis within a week.

        Iran used to be Persia which was a great civilization, in many ways comparable to the Roman Empire. They had notable innovations and were good at engineering. But they did the same thing that so many whites did, they mixed with non-whites. Maybe I should say Aryan because I’m sure they were never pale white. But they never looked like those guys in the movie 300.

            This should be the top comment because it pertains to Italy, Greece, and India as well and nearly every other place that ever had a successful empire or civilization.When mud genetics arrive and the skin starts to darken, civilization dies, the wheels come off. Period. End of line. This is not even refutable.Italy today is not Italy of the Roman Empire because why? Mixing with mud genes. Those Northern Italians who were largely Germanic in appearance became a smaller and smaller minority as the dark races started to intermix in the south.Ancient Greece vs. modern Greece. Look at the art, white skin, white features. Today? Swarthy mixed gene mutts.India in ancient times was not this horrendous Dravidian subcon nightmare place but those dark genes only take you backwards in all ways.Ditto for the Persians. Very white at one time, you can see it in their ancient artwork the skin is as white as a sheet. Today? Mutts. Mixed race, a conquered people that were bred into irrelevance by Muhammad and his conquering Islamic Arabic hordes.The United States?“Amerimutt”is a meme for a reason. We are on this path too with (((rocket boosters))) strapped to our back. They realized how effortlessly easy it is to keep low IQ mixed race brown slurry mud peoples in line. So onwards we lurch to our muddy brown future.

                    It is not that dire because they ARE Europeans at the end of the day. So direct comparisons to the missing links on the dark continent are not valid.–However–, you are correct in that they are definitely a drag on the EU’s economy. Greece being far worse. Italy still has the massive economic engine of the north which is largely just pulling the south along and once again, what is different? Northern Italians are massively mixed with Germanics, French, and Swiss. The farther south you go in Italy the darker the population gets and the economy plummets with it. Causal? Probably? Related? Definitely…I also forgot to throw Spain under the bus. A shadow of their former selves when they ruled the waves and conquered the southern new world. Again, Moors, Muslims, Brown invaders over centuries have degraded them profoundly.This is why our tribal friends focus on NW Europe when importing dark skinned bioweapons, they must rapidly degrade those parts of Europe and from the looks of it they are doing it. A few shekels will get the gates of Toledo opened wide (again…) but in UK, Germany, Sweden, etc.

Mr. Powell can take an axe to rates, but everything either will go sideways or downwards if this pops off or even remains in question. There is absolutely no popular support for such a war outside of American Jewry and diminishing numbers of Chistian Zionists, but when has public opinion ever mattered? The one brake ironically may be the open border, which all but guarantees there will be Allahu Akbar parties in the Clouds’ rat nests if things get hot.

            I think public opinion actually does matter.  Decades ago it would have been easier to go to war against Iran.  Americans were still mad about the hostage crisis.  You are right that DC may go to war anyway but it gets tricky if you don’t have any passion from normie Americans.

                A super majority oppose mass migration. Has that made any difference? Granted, those warm bodies streaming across the border might make for low quality cannon fodder, but still expect such absurdities as “we have to fight them over there or we will have to fight them over there” to impose a draft. Rioting, if it happens, will be used to improve marksmanship.

                    I guess one difference is they do not need our cooperation or involvement to perpetrate the crime of immigration.  If they need numbers for war with Iran, then it would require more involvement from us.  If the plan is to just drone or nuke them, then maybe not.

        This morning one of the main conservative sites quotes Numbers 24:9 as:
“Whoever blesses Israel will be blessed, And whoever curses Israel will be cursed.”https://hotair.com/generalissimo/2024/10/14/things-going-so-bad-for-kamala-harris-shes-trying-to-get-god-on-her-side-n3795770
I looked up the quote and found that most of the translations refer to “the lion,” not Israel.https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-9.htm
I’d be curious about any explanations from Christians. I guess that Ramzpaul would say Jesus made the OT irrelevant.

            Quoting Numbers 24:9 is like quoting one line of a 300 page contract and claiming it explains everything.There are many ways to look at it, the most plausible being that the Church is Israel, not the collection of pseudo-judaites currently occupying the eastern Mediterranean coast.    If you read on in Numbers, you will also see many conditions attached, the main one being “Israel” keeping their side of God’s covenant.  With the rejection of the Messiah (Jesus), those who rejected Him forfeited any participation in the covenant (so He does not make the OT irrelevant, rather He fulfills it).  Thus, by rejecting Christ, those who we commonly refer to as jews, much less some illegitimate political entity, are not the Israel of the OT.  The story of Isaac and Esau (where Esau trades his birthright for some tasty porridge – it has scallions!) is often seen as a precursor.Equating the political entity Israel with the Israel of the OT is like claiming Paris, Texas is the true capitol of France.

                    The promises to Isaac were absolutely conditional because the blessings passing from Abraham were conditional. God directly told Moses that He was going to kill all the rest of Israel after they refused to enter the promised land the first time, and in their place, God would turn Moses into a greater nation than they. The only reason that did not happen was because Moses declined.God still issued Faithless Israel her certificate of divorce later on when Judah was in play, and Faithless Israel constitutes branches torn off the tree of greater Israel, children of faith to Abraham. They are pagans who count for nothing as they are, and the worst of all pagans to trample the temple mount during the time of the Gentiles as Christ foretold.One reason Faithless Israel is the worst of all pagans is because they are revolutionaries against God’s sovereign authority over the nation of Israel. It is written that the spirit of Satan entered Judas Iscariot after Jesus told them what was to come, which is to say, he became a revolutionary against his sovereign as Lucifer was before him. One theory is that Judas believed he could force Jesus’ hand if he delivered Jesus over to the temple authorities. This was repeated by Jerusalem when they chose a murderous insurrectionist over Christ during the passion narrative. It did not end well for Judas or Jerusalem.Christian Zionist are revolutionaries of a slightly different color. They believe they can force God’s hand by being a blood drenched cargo cult for prophecies they do not understand. It is perhaps fitting that they are rapidly losing their country, their wealth, and their ability to pretend to be Christians as they lick the feet of Faithless Israel. While it is unwise to scry God’s will from the latest natural disaster, it is still convenient that the Israeli Uber Allies in Florida lost their state to one of the strongest hurricanes in American history on the eve of war with Iran. They will be a little preoccupied with learning how little the Israeli lobby cares for them to be of much help in the short term.Faithless Israel of today is repeating the parable of the tenants where murdering the true heirs is their plan for claiming an inheritance that is not theirs. As multiple times before, it will end poorly for them.

                Reading the Bible as esoteric messaging, that is, as repurposed political propaganda, means that factions will reinterpret it to their own ends.Myself, I see Esau as the dominant Aryan-linked majority, with Jacob as the mischling minority who claimed to be twin, not merely kin (half-breed).Likewise, in the oldest version, Isaac (root word for Scythian, that is, Aryan) was indeed sacrificed, with the changeling ram being accepted in his place.The original self-serving Great Replacement of stolen identity.Their storytelling style was to take swaths of history and compact them into a character, making history a family tale of this grandfather or that uncle or a brother over there in Egypt, as an archtype of an entire class or tribe. Any child or nomad would understand such a story, much as getting a joke about a Texan, a Sancho, and a Paddy enter a bar…Isaac Asimov did this with his secular version of the OT. Makes it easy to read, and to understand that a race war of dominance and replacement between Zagros Range Semitics and Pontic Aryans is what they’re really talking about. As a history book, they are referring to real events (though often ‘reinterpreted’) all the way through, no oogily-boogily.Forgive me for my irritating habit of seeing this through the lens of the distant past, but the pattern we’re seeing rhymes so hard with the late Neolithic/Early Bronze age.  Racial memory, instinct, is lengthy indeed.

        Another second-order effect that should be mentioned is that Iran is a major oil-supplier to China.
I would think Xi would take a dim view of AINO messing with that supply. At a minimum they would provide intel to Iran. There would also be weird, “production problems, so sorry!” with aspirin, double-A batteries, etc.

            Perhaps, but Russia has just completed a direct pipeline to China, which has a land border with Russia.Here’s what ChatGPT says, including a US citation:“Russia supplies more oil to China than Iran. China has significantly increased its oil imports from both countries due to their discounted crude, but Russian oil consistently accounts for a larger share. In 2023, China imported over 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of Russian oil, compared to about 1.18 million bpd from Iran. Iran’s exports to China have faced challenges, such as price disputes that led to reduced shipments, while Russia remains a key supplier .Both countries have developed systems to bypass Western sanctions and continue supplying oil to China at discounted rates—U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).”

Unfortunately, I really can’t find a flaw in this logic.  This is a very likely outcome.  Trump is generally antiwar but he loves him some Israelies, especially Bibi.  Jared will convince him the Saudis and the rest of the Arab world will love him if he takes out Iran.

Hold on. Might not be all bad, not at all.Maybe…good. Or gooder.
They’ve been floating the son of the Shah on air.
If this reverses their fuckup of putting the Ayatollahs in charge- who immediately went rogue- a limited restoration of the Pahlavi throne might be the linchpin to the Shia Crescent (as the Shia version of the Sunni Ikhwan, the Muslim Brotherhood that fought Nasser’s Ba’athists.)
As Nixon said, the Shah was Israel’s only friend in the Mideast at the time. (So, of course he was betrayed.)

                Quite a choice we have.  Trump loves Israel, and with a Kamala presidency, perhaps we’re not as likely to go to war with Iran, but more likely to get severe restrictions on speech and never-ending Haitians.

            If you gave Trump a truth serum and asked him what he thinks of Israel and Bibi, what would he say? Well, I think Trump actually hates Netanyahu. I doubt he is fond of Jared as well. He knows what these people are like as a group, although he is no doubt fond of some on a personal level. That said, he has clearly made a decision to sidle up to these people. He has said what he has said and is empowering the people who advocate for those same things.

                To first order approximation, there are two factions of the International Jews, each with their own system of accompanying goyim allies carefully cultivated over many decades. The first is the ‘genocide’ faction that now runs the Democrat Party, and the second is the ’empire’ faction which continues to run the Republican Party and hope to counterattack and regain control of the Democrat party.The stunning incompetence (from the perspective of the empire faction’s interests) of the genocide faction has left the empire faction in the uncomfortable and unwanted position of now being willing to cut a deal with Pres. Trump. He will rein in the genocide faction and stabilize the empire for its owners, and in return the owners will …?That is the question. What is Pres. Trump going to get in exchange for imperial restabilization? With whom and what exactly is the deal? Is it agreement to stand aside and not oppose a program of historically unprecdedented deportations? That was item number 1 on Pres. Trump’s public objectives list. The rest were mostly things the empire wants, like undermining dedollarization.The genocide faction will fight deportations every step of the way. They want us dead and gone. The empire faction see us as either slaves or people who need to be culled until we become slaves. Any agreement with them is tactical only, unless one is ok with remaining or becoming their slave.

                    The fact that we have to sit here and talk like this and think like this, just proves my point to be true. We are under hostile occupation and their interests come before our own. You can’t gain power without putting their interests before those of your own people. This is the core, existential problem for Whites and it needs to discuss it openly. Trump’s MAGA/America First eight years ago was the beginning of that, it is why he got into office, but it was also why he was damn near destroyed. This is, I suppose, why we don’t have America First in 2024 but MIGA/make Israel bigger/no tax on tips.

        While I await for approval on my (admittedly) long comment I will note pretty much everyone here is wrong.Trump and the forces around him represent the return to the Carter Doctrine. That is, control/suppression of Iran, keeping cheap oil flowing through the Gulf, using a defacto alliance of Israel and the Saudis in particular.Biden has already failed completely as Iran through the Houthis have shut down the Suez Canal to all intent and purpose. Iran is essentially bankrupting Egypt in financial siege warfare. The US Navy is unable to stop the Houthis. Who outrange them with cheap Iranian drones and missiles.China has certainly taken note. We are already in proxy War with Iran, and have lost. Any action against the Iranian navy would likely result in the Iranians sinking one or perhaps two carriers and certainly associated ships forcing US withdrawal. Cheap missiles and drones beat expensive aircraft carriers and planes, particularly since the range of the missiles and drones beats that of the planes.Also, after trying to regime change Bibi multiple times, the Biden Regime has little leverage, particularly as it tries to hold on to votes in Michigan and donors/organization/leadership in NYC. Just look at the Tim Walz hunting fiasco. His clothes were all new, he was not trained by his staff to operate the shotgun (which was the wrong kind for that sort of hunt), and so on. NYC type operatives are not present, just Michigan types, and it shows like the unforced error by Gov. Whitmer mocking the Eucharist.

        It is greatly underappreciated that Washington used up all his considerable poltical capital to keep America out of the French Revolution. Americans were hot to join. Likely he also read Burke’s short book which single-handedly turned the English public and ruling class away from its eagerness to join in putting heads on pikes. Adams would have tried and failed, and Jefferson would have joined eagerly. With the coming 1865 all the brakes were removed, and with 1913 we learned how to finance it.

        The real joke in all this is that the GAE is not capable of defeating Iran militarily (nor is Israel). It could lob some missiles, perhaps some air strikes which would have a good chance of suffering high casualties, some targeted assassinations as we have seen, something else like the stuxnet virus….. and that’s about it. (unless they really can control plate tectonics, and other such wunderwaffen, but even that would seem insufficient to bring down the Iranian regime). Even the WW2 era GAE military would have been challenged by an actual conquest of Persia. Today’s GAE military, absent some supersecret scifi weapons, is practically toothless to do anything meaningful to “defeat” Iran. Let’s say they really can control the weather, what are they gonna do, start a sand storm? Or are they really planning to nuke them?

        Gary Volgler, retired Lt. Colonel, retired Exxon Mobile executive and was for seven years in charge of Iraq’s oil ministry has written a book.  The title is: “Israel, Winner of the 2003 Iraq oil war.”
It seems that we went to war in Iraq with the intention, maybe the only intention, of stealing oil from Iraq and giving it to Israel.  I knew that we were stealing oil from Syria to give to Israel but I had not heard that we were stealing oil from Iraq and giving it Israel as well.
Ain’t that nice of us.

        Well this is where most Dissidents fail – and our esteemed blog host is no exception. While he has an undisputable expertise on Israel and the US, and a passable understanding of maybe Iran… he has very little understanding of the other arab players mixed up in this. It is forgivable – most North Americans don’t give enough time to the geopolitics, and wheels within wheels going on in arab politics.Arabs are no friends of the white man regardless of nationality. Their alliances are not graved in stone – which ours are in comparison theirs. Treachery and deceit are ways of life and highly prized survival traits in the arab world. The only difference between a jew and a moslem are the mechanics of their faiths. In application, the muzzies are indistinguishable in their propensity for lying, cheating, murder, etc. Unlike whites, their alliances and partnerships shift with the winds and the sands and they will betray you as quickly or faster than they do with each other.However, notwithstanding the above – when existentially challenged they ARE capable of alliances backed by God Himself that will imperil the world. This is not neocon propaganda;  were it not for the incessant meddling, and constant dropping of monkey wrenches into the gears of middle eastern arab politics – a Caliphate is entirely possible and even likely. People forget that when these guys unify – they become world players. They chased off the mongols, the jews, the Christians, and successfully thwarted woke neoliberalism without breaking a sweat. If the Russians allied with them the same way we have with Israel the nukes would have flown decades ago. Unlike us – the Russians are fully cognizant of the shortcomings of the semitic peoples and their various tribes.When it comes to semites – jewish or otherwise… the Global American Empire – and the Russians for that matter – understood the value in keeping the moslems from unifying, and at each other’s throats.The danger in Washington right now is basically incompetence, coupled with the same jewry in Tel Aviv. Bibi is a moron that is actually unifying the arab tribes, and slowly he’s alienating the Americans too. As we are daily reminded by our Hebrew friends – antisemitism is starting to spike in the US.The dissident would be well served by keeping a sharp eye on ALL the players in the current drama – most especially Turkey and Egypt. They are the key players in this. Jewish antics currently have the entire arab world frothing at the mouth. If things go wrong – Israel disappears and the region could go all in on islam as they have in eras past… and that is most likely going to be worse than the current status quo in the region.The end of Israel sounds like a good deal on the face of it… but long term fallout could conceivably be much worse than the current state of affairs.

        It’s possible the THAAD battery is being sent as a trip wire to trigger direct US involvement.Partial THAAD test results are available on Wikipedia. Make of them what you will. It’s curious the interceptor have no warhead and rely on a, “bullet striking bullet,” kinetic kill method.It is probably possible to overwhelm the system with a 10:1 ratio of decoys to live missiles.Short of going nuclear, it’s hard to imagine the long-term damage that  could be inflicted on Iran. Their geography almost seems purposely designed to resist GAE invasion. None of their neighbors are suicidal proxies like Ukraine.Worst case, they manage to sink a carrier or two with hypersonics and this goes nuclear.

        OFF TOPIC: can someone explain something to me like a dummy please?  Is it true that the oil in the middle east was found and excavated by companies of the british empire?  If so, how and when did the UK simply relinquish control and let the arab nations nationalize the oil they never found?

                But why?  I get the the Empire became no more.  But surely someone in the West/USA could’ve seen that control of the oil was everything?  Why would Western companies find and excavate the oil and then allow it to be taken over by comparative primitives/hostiles who promptly used that oil to enrich themselves and weaponize it against the people who made it possible? !

                    On their way out, the British, with American connivance, set up the Gulf State monarchies to parcel out the oil resources to friendly Sunnis who were mostly indifferent to Israel, and would keep the oil flowing. See: ARAMCO.It worked pretty well until the 1973 Yom Kippur War, which shamed the Arab regimes into an oil embargo, which set off inflation in the West and basically ended the post WW2 prosperity. From that point on, access to Middle Eastern oil was considered a vital American interest that would be defended aggressively, and was on several occasions.The irony, 50 years on, is that fracking and newly discovered reserves, especially of natural gas, have made ME oil much less important, at least to the United States. If we had a serious nuclear power program, it would be a joke. The rake from the dollar denominated energy markets is more valuable than the resources themselves.So now we do the bidding of the bond traders and the Israeli lobby, who are not precisely the same people, but close cousins.

            An interesting factoid is Eichmann…I heard reference to the fact that he was the liason between Britain and Germany for the Havarra Transfer program, which was running in both nations before and…even throughout the war…and that this secret was so dire to the Narrative is why they kidnapped and silenced him, with Arendt’s silly “for no reason at all” propaganda as cover.Both nations wanted the irritant gone, or both nations were built up and used to force settlement and reclamation of Jerusalem as a base for Eretz Ysrael and the fulfillment of the Revelations?   Two birds with one stone.  What power, to effect such schemes.

        I was assigned to the THAAD Battalion at Ft. Bliss, TX in the early 2000’s. It was a very impressive system at that time, with accuracy and speed being two of its biggest attributes. But that was 20 years ago…but suspect Iranian technology would be representative of that time. Maybe it will take out 60-75% of engagements but that still leaves them vulnerable to a swarm.

            My guess is the THAAD will be integrated into the Israeli Patriot system. In theory, this will provide some defense against the better Iranian ballistic missiles. The trouble is the missiles are getting better and cheaper.

        “The Patriot system was also supposed to be a great system until it was destroyed by the Russians in Ukraine as soon as it was deployed.”
That’s not accurate. Russian missiles or drones may have damaged one Patriot battery, but there is more than one Patriot system battery in Ukraine.  Patriot systems in Ukraine have successfully intercepted a number of Russian missiles, including the much hyped Kinzhal missiles.

        Iran should be a slightly tougher nut to crack than Iraq. It has three times the population and a de facto alliance with Russia. Even China might want to get involved.The problem for the Americans is what to do if and when they win. The first Bush was wise in that he halted a drive on Baghdad during Desert Storm. The complications that would result from reordering Iranian society are astronomical. This isn’t Prince of Persia, the videogame, with simple solutions and a guaranteed way out. Enforced change would have to start in Tehran and spread to the provinces. It is a difficult, difficult scenario…— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

Most of that money is lost to some kind of waste that does not put weapons into battle.

                Define “Win”  That is the real issue.  We could bomb Iran into the stone age. But what we probably cannot do, at least not easily is invade and conquer Iran.  Just getting all the troops on the ground would not be easy.  The ports that could facilitate it are in range of Iranian missiles.  Plus, it might very well draw in Iran’s allies.  If China and Russia will not help you if the evil empire attacks you, what is the point of partnering with them?

                Of course we “could” win a conventional war, we have an economy and the industry, Iran does not. The problem is two fold: duration and occupation.We can’t gear up as we did in WWII and the US public can’t stand a hot conflict for more than a few months. Occupation will prove as fruitless as it did in the 2nd Gulf War as Muslim sand people are hopeless candidates for democracy—as we know it.There is also a third aspect, total bankruptcy as we saw with Britain after WWII. So if we expand the definition of ”win”, then you’ve got a point.

                    The simulations for invading Iran posit the need for a two million man army.   Some say you would need more than that.   Supposing you could come up with an army of that size in the West, it would probably not be a high IQ army.  We just don’t have the social capitol for that anymore.If you have that army where would you stage it?   Turkey won’t want to play.  The Saudis would be insane to allow that.   The Russians may come to the conclusion that it is not in their best interest to allow an army like that to stage anywhere in the ME.If you could get that army in a position to invade Iran, that would be the mother of all meatgrinders.  If you liked the military invasion in Iraq, you will love an invasion of Iran.It would be an extremely bad idea but then again we specialize in bad ideas.

                        All you’ve stated was related to what I said above.  It’s theoretically doable, but not in a time frame we can withstand/undertake. In WWII we started with about 330K active and national guard.  At end we had 12M under arms. Casualties are not the issue, except in population’s support of the effort.  All wars come down to economy and will.  We can out build Iran in the long run, but the will of the populace is another story.  Time will never be on our side there.  In the case of Iran, they’ve no choice but to defend their country.  Finally, what is victory?  Not a thing in all of Iran worth one American life.
