        The Rickchurian Mortydate is real. Ooooweeeee!
I’ve got a feeling that Trump has had some Deep State moles working for him for a long time, feeding him intelligence, probably for a few years before he announced his candidacy. The utter confidence with which he told Hillary “you’d be in jail” and her supposed outbursts about the personal repercussions if he defeated her just seem too coincidental.
I hope he burns it all down.

            Way back in the olden thymes after the FBI had broomed the e-mail investigation, NYC detectives found classified material on Weiner’s laptop. That forced Comey to re-open the case. I’ve always suspected that there is some guy somewhere in the system who is talking to the good guys.

                Undoubtedly. Wouldn’t it be nice to know years from now that the actual “resistance” (as opposed to the #resistance of the leftist glitterati) was a conservative underground operation within the agencies, dating back to the Obama years?
Personally, I think Mattis and Kelly might have a lot to do with this. It feels like someone with a sure touch of the personalities involved and how to run an actual operation had their hands on this. It doesn’t feel like amateur hour.

                    Think for a moment how far and  wide the network of guys is that served under one or both and where many might be placed. I’ve run in a few ex Mattis guys and they would do anything at his command.

                        It’s a Marine thing. To a much greater extent, we maintain a loyalty to the Corps and each other than the other services, even after we get out.
Mattis was my division commander in Iraq. He does inspire that kind of devotion among us. It wouldn’t be too far fetched that former Mattis subordinates out of uniform and in the bureaucracy formed a network to do some war by other means.

                I do think there are “cultural” issues within the FBI causing some large fissures in the edifice that J. Edgar Hoover erected.  The old Fordham Law School types, Democrats to a man, mostly Irish sons-of-cops, have been replaced by snooty SPS Episcopalians like Mueller who’ve never bothered to get their hands dirty in real street level investigations.  The only people they seem to be impressing with their integrity are those they went to “school” with.

                Zman – I’m not sure if I asked you on Twitter but do you remember when Erik Prince went on Breitbart Radio after Comey reopened the investigation and stated that NYPD found mountains of incriminating evidence on Weiner’s laptop and that they made a copy before turning it into the FBI? It made huge waves on Drudge. I would definitely listen to the interview.

        For a long time the FBI was pretty ferocious about keeping their independence from the DOJ.  Hoover was famous for his rumored blackmail tactics, but he used that power to keep the FBI independent.Now we’ve had a string of Directors who came from the politicized DOJ – James Baker, James Comey and Robert Mueller.  They infected the FBI with their politics and surrendered their independence to the hacks.  Can you imagine Hoover’s FBI writing that swishy-washy memo to save a dirty candidate because he liked her politics?If we are going to keep the FBI as a Federal law enforcement agency, their independence has to be re-established.

        Z Man – I see you linked on the Doug Ross Journal almost every day now. Great job! It is heartening o see people you admire getting a broader circulation and succeeding. We can only hope that some heads will roll. I worked with a guy who had a strong theory that the only way you get into these top positions of power is IF they have something on you. In other words, you practically have to pose for a picture doing something horrible in order to get into the cabal so they can guarantee control over you later, or you will simply never rise to any particular level of power. When I look at Terry McAwful in Virginia, McCabe, Rosenstein, Comey, etc. they are long time bag men for someone. They got where they are by doing the dirty work for others and compromising themselves with the promise of more power, more control, etc. Just look at the patterns of their involvement in one scandal after another and it is easy to see that they have been doing the wet work and covering up the crimes of others for decades.

            The way rotten police precincts work is not a lot different from how criminal gangs work. They way in is to be seen committing various crimes. Cops who would refuse to take cash or drugs, would be harassed out of the precinct, or worse.My sense with the FBI is that the management ranks have been subverted the same way the universities were subverted. Progressives slowly over time rewarded their own and punished those not dedicated to the cause. Before long, it is a self-perpetuating system. If you want to move up in the FBI, you better be into Democrat politics.The trouble is, and we see it in this case, is you end up with loyalists who may not be very bright. Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Page and Ohr were recklessly stupid. They never considered the possibility that someone may be looking. That’s because they never had a job in the bureau where they had to investigate wrong doing.

                Stupidity is exactly the right description for these clowns, and loyalty in this case serves as an inverse patriotism, because they are being “loyal” to a person, not to their country or to the US Constitution, to which they all took an oath of allegiance!

            Victor Davis Hansen has a great piece out today in the National Review.  His take is that all of these people were auditioning for bigger and better roles in the future Clinton administration by clearly and prominently breaking the rules in her favor.  As VDH points out, if she would have won, there would be no scandals.

                The flip side of that is if they don’t jump aboard the Hillary train, and she wins as everyone expected, their career is toast. Not working against her is not good enough, if you’re not actively helping, you’re an enemy. If this eventually does lead to indictments, I won’t be surprised to hear that as a defense.

        I have a theory to explain the Chief Justice’s confounding behavior; he’s got something buried in his past that’s being held over his head. We have yet to get the full story on him. This might also explain the actions, or lack thereof, of Jeff Sessions.
Those 900 FBI files the Clintons stole must be a fraction of the blackmail material they’ve collected from year to year. Of course, that would be piddling compared to what’s available if the intelligence collecting apparatus of the United States is the property of the Left.

            I must preface this by saying I have no inside knowledge of Chief Justice Roberts.  What I do remember is that when conservatives were outraged by the Supremes ruling on Obamacare one rumor floating around was that O had dirt on Roberts’ adoptions.  Apparently the Chief and his wife’s kids are adopted and they seemed to get two apparently hale children in a rather short amount of time.  There was a rumor floating around that he may have cut legal corners to get them.
I don’t know if that’s true.

                    Was that it?  I didn’t remember specifics but I’m told in this age of legal abortion orphans are actually in fairly short supply.  It was noted that the Chief adopting two healthy white children in a fairly brief time span was fishy.

                        Used to be that judges/lawyers were often privy to “problems” that people had, like unwanted children for whom the parent(s) could not provide.  So. . . they would connect the child with prospective adoptive parents who were eager to have the addition to their family.  This was called a “private placement.”

        You drain the swamp by using the tools and rules of the bureaucracy against it.  In this case, the House is using its power to declassify information to remove what has long been considered an impenetrable veil behind which the Government Party operations: security classification schemes.  Just slap a TS/SCI stamp on it, and it disappears faster than the Lost Ark of the Covenant in a warehouse.The thing that really gave all this life is that text database of joy that Strzok and Page were keeping.  First, there’s the dead serious issue of the FBI’s head of counterintelligence engaging in the #1 activity they tell even the most green recruits you should never ever do: have an illicit affair.  That is how intelligence officers are “flipped” by foreign spies.  That this guy was the lead investigator of the illegal Clinton email server tells you much about how deep the rabbit hole goes…and the lengths to which people will cover that shit up.  That database of joy is the gift that keeps on giving, such as Strzok texting Page that after 10 months of investigating “Russian collusion” he had seen no evidence of any collusion.  That only adds to Trump’s justification to fire Mueller.The looney Left has resorted to calling everyone, everywhere, a Russian agent/bot, and they are calling so many people “comrade”, that you start to wonder if maybe they’ve forgotten that this is the party that tried to nominate Bernie Sanders for President.  Evidence of insanity in plain sight.The buildup for the memo is too big, so I’m skeptical it will bring down the whole house of cards.  But I do think it has brought down McCabe at the FBI, and more heads are probably gonna roll at FBI and DOJ.  Will it be enough for Trump to fire Mueller is anybody’s guess…but I remain optimistic that using the rules and tools of the bureaucracy against it is the best weapon in this Government Party Civil War.Next up: declassified the ENTIRE Benghazi investigation.  The whole thing, just release it.

            The Conservative Treehouse people seem to think this is an orchestrated process by Grassely, Nunez, Goodlatte and Sessions. They get the memo out and then start declassifying its source material. They get a bit too deep in the weeds for my tastes, but I think they are correct that this memo is about setting up something else. My guess is they are building a case for a select committee or possibly a second special prosecutor who would investigate all of it, including Mueller.I think Mueller and Rosenstein are either in on the process or they are part of the corruption. I’m not sure which at this stage. Mueller staffing his office with Clinton cronies who leak like crazy to the press suggests he’s part of the problem.

                In politics, wins go to those who most meticulously set up the desired result and then work to see it through.  If Conservative Treehouse is correct, the good guys are doing a hell of a job on this one.  CTH also ends up being a combo of the Lewinsky Matt Drudge and the Watergate Woodward and Bernstein, if they are correct about all of this.  The bad guys have gotten incredibly sloppy and brazen in their tactics, having served under a sloppy and brazen Obama for all these years.  Popcorn and beer time.

                Mueller is there to defend the Establishment against Trump, and to try to bleed Trump out.  His goal is to try and survive the 2018 midterms in hopes that the Democrats won Congress (impeachment).  Call it the “Bill Kristol Insurance Plan”.He’s also there to try and restore something resembling public credibility to a Comey-decimated FBI.  The problem of course being that the FBI lacks credibility because they deliberately pooched the Clinton investigation, and because they are not investigating Clinton/DNC collaboration with “the Russians” via an MI6 agent…the only actual “Russian collaboration” anybody has completely proved…I think “#releasethememo” is about firing Mueller.  Congress has identified wrongdoing (hence McCabe’s ouster), and the Democrats are100% right that the memo is designed to “undermine” Mueller.  In the sense that you actually DO want to undermine Organized Crime.

            Hok;Re the reported Strzok-Page affair: There was a recent thread over at the CTH where the consensus was that there was no actual affair, it was a cover story for extra-legal, swamp-creature back-channel communication.Their logic: Other than a single leaked story in the press from one of the usual suspects, there was no other confirmation/verification of same; Just no denial.  The affair story would have been a convenient swamp-rat cover for establishing a communication and coordination channel between the senior DOJ staffers (Page) and senior FBI political operatives (Strzok) outside of official channels.  Some of their tweets seem to be inconsistent with an affair.  The vast volume of tweets and their seeming carelessness was likewise cited as contrary evidence.  Finally, there are none of the intimate (i.e. sexual) details that one might expect from the purported situation that are being revealed.  (However, these may exist but are redacted/suppressed by the FBI IG – but you know they’d be in the tabloid press if any existed in the semi-public domain)They may be overthinking the situation, but I recall reading some printed intel material from the WWII era that advised that if one were captured by the enemy, and about to be broken during interrogation, you should confess to some lesser (preferably sexual) peccadillo consistent with what the enemy  knows already.  In theory the Nazi’s/Japs would jump on this theory-of-the-case because it eliminated their mental strain by tying up the loose ends of their scanty actual evidence into a (far lesser) culpability.  And it is one explanation that anyone could understand (particularly them).  And it obscures the actual, far more dangerous, intel culpability that you desperately need to conceal.

                They’re overthinking it.  FBI/DOJ have already acknowledged that many of the texts will not be turned over because they are of an intimate personal nature (or words to that effect).  Probably some Anthony Weiner-esque pictures…which would put a nice little bow on the whole “who is watching the watchers?” angle.
No, they thought they had beat the monitoring system.
They didn’t need a cover story.

                    I’m with you.  Within the released texts there were too many from Strzok that read more like a 17 year trying to impress his girlfriend than anything else.  Hopefully she had some kind of “talent”, not exactly a looker.

                            OT, but pertinent. If we do not use the leftist/globalists’ language (“google it” instead of “research it” or “look it up,”) it takes away a huge advantage they have.
DuckDuckGo didn’t do the analytics for HRC’s campaign and does not track and data-mine for the Dims OR have 80% of the world’s searches…I’m sure there are others, as well.
The “google it” thing was brilliant of them, in an evil sort of way. Hope now that their discrimination has been proven, we can start taking some of that power.

                        I never will understand the male mind.  Lisa is downright homely, Strzok’s wife is really nice looking, plus she’s pulling her weight, income-wise, with a super gig at the SEC.  I guess there were some shenanigans there, too, for this to take place.I miss the good old days back in the mid-60s when most attractive college grads ended up in New York City, the girls at Time Inc. as researchers and the guys at stock brokerages.  Lots of good times before settling down in Greenwich or Short Hills.  The homely girls went to D. C. and labored away in some govt office.  If they were decent lookiing, they got to shack up with some Congressman during the week, as he was “back in the District” on weekends with the wife and kids.  Not a lot of lighthearted fun there.  No wonder fifty years later, these babes are such bitches!

                            Doc;If this is a serious question about the male mind, I’ll give you a semi-serious answer 😉I think that it was Robin Williams who said something like, ‘God gave men two heads but not enough blood to run both at the same time.’What he was missing was the modifier ‘young’ in front of ‘men’.  That, and the fact that the higher you are born or get up the greasy pole, the longer you can prolong that aspect of adolescence.  Most of us had figured out in our ’20s (because we had to) that it was a bad idea to just go all ‘hold my beer and watch this’ with our lives.  We had important things to lose.Robin jumped up the pole very quickly. Maybe he never did figure it out.

        Individual ambition shoved personal honor off the stage decades ago. My guess is that there no more than a few–if that–legislators who don’t have some damaging secret ripe for exposure if they step out of line. CYA: the only rule by which they go.

            IMO, I think that’s why General David Petreaus was appointed CIA chief by Obama.  Petreaus hadn’t exactly tried to keep his affair with his Army girlfriend-biographer very secret, probably thinking that his poop didn’t stink, and Obama thought he was just perfect for the CIA.  Remember how he was sidelined when Benghazi investigations were underway?  Guys like that with something to hide make very useful appointees.  I think it may be something other than adopting the kids in Roberts’ case.  Maybe something more personally compromising, like some sex thing.

        Tip of the iceberg. Clinton’s have been selling out the US for decades, and also blackmailing key people in DC; that is how they got away with literal murder. Obama followed in their footsteps, but was not as talented and hence the current scandal. It’s unlikely DC can clean up this mess on it’s own (more likely a few token patsies will get taken down). It’s the citizens who must right this ship, and it has always been thus. The question is . . . will we get the chance before we’re outnumbered?

        “Republicans are afraid of their own shadow” ? ,  absolutely not. they are as corrupt as the democrats, just to different masters. They have sold out to the cheap labor billionaires (meatpacking, light industrial,chamber of commerce)  and the defense contractors . who couldn’t see that the only thing they will go to the wall for is the “dreamers” . and to stop trumps wall.Since trump is not onboard, he is a threat to the agenda they are paid to implement.  GOP Senators like Burr,Flake,Mccain, and Graham are actively supporting the democratic efforts to overthrow trump.How does any of that help the base? the opioid crisis is fueled by fentanyl from Mexico, but that’s a price the GOP open borders guys are willing to let us pay for making it easy for cheap labor to get here.https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-01-28/mexico-police-find-enough-fentanyl-kill-millions-en-route-us-border

Regardless its a risky play. Killing President Trump’s allies might provoke a civil war as our President is an aggressive man by nature
Attempted Deep State Putsch
Martial Law Declared
Civil War
no matter who wins US Is over

            No, this one stays a Government Party civil war.  The firings/retirements at the FBI will continue.  McCabe and Strzok are just the start of this.  Then the IG report comes out, and a few more leave…and the whole thing starts to shift to the DOJ.Trump is riding high, and he has political capital to burn right now.I do think Democrats will double-down on the crazy-talk.  All that “comrade” stuff is wearing really, really, thin on the blogs.  I’ve been encouraging people to mock it more because the more the Dems say it, the more they reveal how batshit crazy they have become.The more likely outcome is a minor implosion of the civil service corps as people retire from government (and also Congress, like Paul Ryan who sees the writing on the wall), and the Republicans in Congress who DO have a spine will be emboldened by this “#releasethememo” thing to go even further.  PARTICULARLY because Paul Ryan is leaving.  Cryin’ John Boehner’s butt buddy has consistently been an obstacle to progress.

        I really like the timing of all of this.  After the State of the Union Trump should have total control of the media narrative.  The three issues will be the infrastructure spending bill, the immigration compromise he’s offered, and the dirty tricks/abuse of power by the FBI and Obama administration.  It’s winning, more winning, and even more winning.
On a sadder note following up a big tax cut with a big spending bill is such typical DC bullshit.  But whatever, at some level I think Cheney was right that deficits don’t matter.

        On 26 October of 2016 I was on the /politically incorrect/ board on 4chan when someone made a post about creating a fake intelligence dossier based on pornographic stories made famous elsewhere on 4chan. This person claimed to have passed it on to a British official with access to John McCain. This was of course dismissed as fake and gay and the original poster was advised to kill himself, but I remember thinking it would be hilarious if true. Fast forward to Piss Gate. Thoughts?

            The fake dossier had been shopped around the NY/DC media community for some time before Oct 2016.

                Wasn’t the p!ss portion of the dossier added to spice things up for the second FISA application, since the first one was rejected by the FISA court? I haven’t followed the timeline all that closely.

            Just saw the name Cody Shearer on Drudge, claiming he has a dossier similar to this one.  He was a Clinton dirty trickster for years; his twin sister Brooke, deceased from cancer, was married to Strobe Talbott, Deputy Sec’y of State and Russian “expert,” now head of the Brookings Institution, D. C. think tank.  Brooke also was tight with Hillary before Huma Abedin was born; Brooke was also a “private investigator,” according to her obit.  The older brother of these two (Brooke and Cody) is Derek Shearer, an early Clintonista, who Bill Clinton appointed as Ambassador to Finland.  He was in Strobe’s class at Yale.  Neither one is pictured in the yearbook, although Shearer has a write-up.  Weird how Strobe avoided this, like he always knew he was going to be some sort of shady spy and didn’t want his early life to be recorded.  He was the Editor of the Yale Daily News back then.  George W. Bush was in the same class!  I would not be surprised if old Strobe is behind some of this Russia collusion nonsense, as one last favor being called in by the Clintons.  My radar went up when I saw this.  I have been suspicious of this gang for many years.
