        I think that the difference between the Romans and us is that (and this is one thing the Marxists got right) in classical times, there was no class consciousness.  The Plebs might haverevolted, but they could never have arevolution.  I think that the first true revolution was in 1688.  It is the first middle-class revolution and it had a renewing effect on England.I think that there is hope.  I think that we could have a “Glorious Revolution” like the Brits did in 1688.  But that means is that we are going have to take risks.  We are going have to take the risk of going extra-legal for a while to return to legality and justice.  We are going to have to drop the pseudonyms and lead from in front.  We are going to have to mass and stick our necks out.The alternatives are aristocracy, empire, and decline — or a hot civil war (which a bloodless revolution might trigger anyway), a hot civil war which might make a US-USSR nuclear exchange look like a pillow fight.Is liberty worth the risks?

        The years 1861, 1913, 1919, and 1933 were all very significant. ’61 lit the fuse and  ’33 represented escape velocity. I don’t see this thing ever coming back down.
I’m sure the Romans had a similarly vague experience, but Cicero pretty much declared it over in 66 BC.
To my ear we are closer to the state of the Athenian Assembly around the time they sentences Socrates to death for making fun of them, and, basically, telling them to kiss his ass.

        NOW, I see that I wrote “not close” – when I meant “now close” – kinda different.
But that’s kinda the way hyperbolic curves are in reality. The real data aren’t perfectly smooth, but, like you said, have inflection points. Only the theoretical, regression analysis points, make a smooth line.

        For my money, the long, slow, decline of our Republic began immediately after the installation of the Constitution. The mortal wound was the Civil War, when the States lost ultimate power to the Federal Government. We are not close to the beginning of the hyperbolic part of the curve, rule of law vs rule of lawyer.

            It is an unanswerable question, JD. The decline is a process, not an event. I tend to agree that the Civil War was an inflexion point. Once that check on Federal power was gone, the clock started ticking on the Republic. World War I is another inflexion point.
The general lawlessness we see with Obama is not entirely new either. The contempt for custom and the law was on display with Clinton. I think I can make the argument that Watergate was a watershed moment in the growing lawlessness of the ruling class.
