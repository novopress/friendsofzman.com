        Speaking of lunacy, did you see where Palin says she is “seriously” considering a 2016 run at the WH? Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but — man, she draws the lefty loonies out of the woodwork like nothing else!
The commenters are _foaming_at_the_mouth_ over at the WaPo.
She’s rich, pretty, athletic, successful, smarter than the average bear, AND she loves and upholds traditional American values. No wonder they can’t stand her.
I would vote for her just to see all the commie’s heads exploding like fireworks.
Walker/Palin or Palin/Walker, 2016 !!

        Actually, this is sort of a good thing.  A white progressive assaulting a black constitutionalist?  In violation of the Constitution?This is something that should be pumped up like Ferguson….

        I am increasingly proud to be all of the things the left rants against.

        It’s always amusing when narratives collide.  “He’s black! But he’s got a gun! But he’s black, but but…”

        I’d be interesting in knowing how the guy with the gun was dressed. I know we are not “supposed” to judge people based on their clothing, but of course everyone does. Unless of course this is solely about race. Which I don’t know. I’m also thinking that if I had a Concealed Carry permit, that there’s no way I’d allow someone to observe me handling my weapon. If you don’t know the meaning of concealed, perhaps you ought not carry.

        “As long as the U.S. has existed, so too have vigilantes[…]”
Not “since time immemorial”. Not “throughout human history”.
Vigilantism began in 1776, localized to the U.S.

        Maybe not, Z-man.  Two out of the twelve articles on her daily beast page are about prison weddings.  Maybe she’s got a pen pal on the inside already.
