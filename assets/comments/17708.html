        Earlier this year I royally pissed off a French lady, when I politely informed her that France was not strictly speaking a country anymore, as it had control of neither its borders nor its currency.
Perhaps this was unkind but her boundless admiration for the EU was starting to bug me.

            France has proven willing and able to close its borders (if only temporarily) in defiance of globalist dictate. America has not.
As for the currency‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt even get me started.

Well, in a nutshell, the Federal Reserve is a private entity owned by the major banks, subject to neither Congress nor the government. If you hurry, you can probably still find a video or two on Youtube.

                        Felix, you make a point that likely fewer than one in a hundred in this country understand about our Federal Reserve.  It is a banking cartel, run by and for the big banks.  Ask a knowledgable community banker about the Fed sometime.

            By those criteria the US is not a country any more, either, as it too controls neither its borders nor its currency.  But then. Again, the U.S. has not been a country for quite a while now, and by many more criteria than those.

                    True, but the problem is, at least until around the late 90s or so, the American empire was at least mostly an /American/ empire.
It‚Äôs not even /that/ any more.

                    No it is not. You confuse legitimate legal, geopolitical and geoeconomics with empire and tribute. There may be similarities but they are far more different than alike. If America WERE an empire, we‚Äôd have enslaved the moslem mutts in Iran and Iraq, and be profiteering like bandits on their oil. Hell, we wouldn‚Äôt even get our hands dirty; our vassals would do our dirty work for us. Last time I looked, every second yodelling rag head in Iraq was gobbling about death to America, Israel and half a dozen other demons and rivers of blood.This is a weak point of the dissident right as I see it, and a possible fracture point. We need to define what constitutes legitimate and reasonable foreign investment, and exactly what our capital assets are and to what lengths we can go to protect them.It‚Äôs been my experience on such topics that we are often undermined by the usual morons carping about eeeeeevil jooooos and neocons ‚Äì and everything degenerates from there. Until we address this issue the dissident right can never be anything more than a hobby horse for failed libertarians, neoreactionaries and cucks.

You don‚Äôt seem to understand: /we/ ARE the vassals, and yes, we DID do the dirty work, and no, our imperial overlords did NOT get their hands dirty.  Empire does not automatically work solely by your pronouncement, simply because you looked the word up in Webster‚Äôs.  Here, bravo, you get a gold star.
But you get docked twelve points for the stale old hand-waving about ‚Äúmorons‚Äù and ‚Äújooooos‚Äù when faced with legitimate criticism of a genuine international criminal syndicate.

            Nathaniel Bell‚Ä¶ I know what you mean, its hard not to take baby jabs in conversations when you hear drivel. Its an unwholesome pleasure but hard to resist. And sometimes you ‚Äúget served‚Äù as the kids say.I had an interesting and surprising exchange about two weeks ago. Went to the book store at the local public library (OT: great place to get books cheaply if yours has one).Was chatting literature while I perused with the 60ish year old woman volunteer. Most of the volunteer gals are nice but the sort that read Michelle Obama‚Äôs ‚Äúautobiography‚Äù. She said she had just finished an outstanding book on The Holocaust. I was feeling a bit spicy and looked at her blankly, ‚ÄúWhich one, the Armenian holocaust, the Cathars, the Muslim subjugation of Eastern Europe?‚ÄùThought that‚Äôd be the end of it or I would get a rise. Instead she told me she was aware of the Armenian Holocaust but hadn‚Äôt heard of the Cathars, and jotted it down on a scratch pad.We started chatting and lo and behold I was enchanted when this lady turned out to be a highly intelligent chameleon. Staunchly Christian, from a multi-generational military family, Western Civ devotee, voracious reader of classic literature, anti-immigration, agog at the anti-white trends of our culture, abreast of the decline of Europe, etc‚Ä¶ I felt like I should pull up a chair and prepare to be schooled.We talked for nearly an hour between the occasional customers. At one point she noted my tattoos (one a Christian symbol, the other my former military unit) and smiled, she said, ‚ÄúGod and Country.‚ÄùShe guided the conversation around to the travesty of pulling statues down and attacking works of western literature (as a former school teacher she was outraged). I proffered, ‚ÄúWe are an amazing people and we don‚Äôt deserve this.‚ÄùI kid you not, she looked conspiratorially over her shoulder and whispered to me (we were alone), ‚ÄúNo. No we don‚Äôt. Have you ever heard of Q or Qanon?‚Äù I was gobsmacked. I got served. Who expects a female boomer to be anything but a box-wine aunty or a Civ-Nat? In a public library? She also jotted down Zman‚Äôs podcast info of course.I swear, if I wasn‚Äôt already married and separated from this lady by a decade and a half, I‚Äôd have asked her for a date.

                Oh yes. There are far more of us than we know.Things get very interesting when I talk to people my age or younger about such things, especially white ones.  They genuinely do not know about their own mighty heritage, and when you share a little history with them doubt is planted.In my experience the burning of Norte dame affected young whites deeply, though they couldn‚Äôt say why. For some it felt like betrayal, even if they can‚Äôt articulate exactly what was betrayed.I commonly take polite verbal jabs at peoples beliefs, and not solely for my own twisted amusement. The first step in recovering from a virus is getting the body to realize it‚Äôs infected.Hence, plant doubt.

        The elites in both the EU and the Anglosphere are both a false aristocracy:  a combination of  avaricious jumped up white trash and foreign parasites who are hell bent on destroying their native population civilization wide.
There is no precedent or analogy for this. Maybe Attila and the Hun. But they had military superiority.

            ‚ÄúFalse‚ÄùI‚Äôm sorry to say it, but I think the elite are quite well superior to us in mental faculties. They‚Äôve outfoxed our surprise wins, through lawfare and deplatforming. By and large they haven‚Äôt needed to lock our supporters up, and extrajudicial killings are few and speculative. I think we have to win via hubris on their side.The Tiger I Panzer was overbuilt and hard to maintain, while being otherwise superior to the Sherman. It was also supposedly damaged via sabotage in the production process, and hampered by supply shortages. Our problem is that we aren‚Äôt facing a 1944 Tiger I, but a 2019 M1 Abrams, while still being in that 1944 Sherman.https://www.unz.com/akarlin/the-rights-human-capital-problem/

                Your perspective is too short-term.We are ruled by a false aristocracy. A natural aristocracy evolves and rules from a throne and altar.  They are first in war and first in faith.  Complexity expands that into a complex woven institutional social fabric. They oversee the symbiotic relationship between the social castes.  They are conservative in setting an example and keeping in check any group or individual who acts in a destructive behavior.  A natural Aristocracy rules a polis of naturally evolved hierarchical  estates. A hierarchy that is both vertical and horizontal. Z did a podcast about some right wing political theories a month ago.  He spent most of it describing Anarcho-Futurism.  Carlyle described this in an earlier age, Faye wrote a more modern version.  The Anarcho is the structure described above.  It founded and built our civilization from the Pleistocene up to the Enlightenment.  From that point on we took a wrong turn at every fork in the road.We no longer have a functioning civilization.  The estates (castes) that evolved have been so corrupted and turned on their head that chaos rules the day.  In an age that worships miasma it is the slime that rises to the top.  Parasites who would have been kept in check in a sane age now set the agenda and rule.  Yes, they are superior at being manipulative lowlifes in a civilization that idealizes mammon and orgasm.  An aristocracy of vermin.And they are well aware of what they are and that their power is knotted with flimsy propaganda and not deeply rooted natural leadership. This is why they are so terrified by small groups of dissenters.In the end all power lies with nature and not man‚Äôs fantasies.  We either build a civilizational order that parallels nature or we build one that chafes against the natural order.  One that chafes until it collapses.

                    &gt;&gt;&gt;A natural aristocracy evolves and rules from a throne and altar.
This was certainly true within traditional societies, both European and non-European.  The great question for the modern world is whether an aristocracy can be dominated by grifters and con-men, and still function.  The Western aristocracy says ‚Äúyes, it can‚Äù (but of course they‚Äôre lying).

                Silicon Valley is now run by rentier Jews who really hate people like us and have the wealth to impose their views on us at will.  This is not the Silicon Valley that actually innovated and created new computers, etc.As for the ruling class, they have three things that making controlling us easy.1) Control of the courts/system whose members hold the same views as them.2) Control of the MSM3) Control of the Wall Street bubble machine that gives proles the illusion of wealth and keeps them pacified.  This last one is a ticking time bomb. When it goes the next time they won‚Äôt be able to re-inflate again and will probably spawn a outright rebellion against the establishment.And they have shown they cannot rule. Witness the decay of cities under their control. Los Angeles is now suffering from Typhus and Typhoid outbreaks. It‚Äôs just a matter of time before Bubonic plague gets going. Seattle is drowning in homeless people. Portland is becoming ungovernable. San Francisco is awash of human and drug waste. NYC is regressing to the bad times of the 1970‚Äôs.They are so arrogant they cannot admit they are wrong and so have locked themselves into a death spiral.

        The current European elite is both anti-democratic, it is unwilling to defend Europe against the Persia of this age, which is peripatetic Arabs and Africans.
It would take the armed forces of Luxembourg (the true capital of the EU) a few weeks to whip both Africa and the Arab Street.
The Persians are the globalists ‚Äì our own leaders ‚Äì the POC are merely one of the weapons they wield against us.

        I don‚Äôt really find the whole Brexit drama all that interesting. The UK is dead, her capitol city occupied by hostile foreigners and her own people completely disengaged. The rest of Western Europe is in the same boat. Demographics is a slow moving force but you can‚Äôt flip it around in a year or five. If you already have a huge, fecund non-European population and a native European population that refuses to reproduce itself, as Douglas Murray wrote in The Strange Death of Europe‚Ä¶‚ÄúEurope today has little desire to reproduce itself, fight for itself or even take its own side in an argument.‚Äù‚Ä¶then it is doomed.I am more interested in seeing if Eastern Europe can get over their understandable historic hostility with Russia and make common cause with them. They may be a mess right now but Russians and Poles are still far more intelligent than Eritreans and Somalis, the new Western Europeans.Maybe the EU can prolong itself with a handful of technocrats but eventually turning your major cities into cesspools is going to bring it down, unless some sort of global pandemic or major war comes along.

            The potential of automation causing a secular decline in unemployment is one way to break the logjam. The public is often skeptical of immigration, but doesn‚Äôt vote for the nationalist right. Some of these people are genuinely concerned that the economy will crack, and their pensions will be unfunded.
If there is nothing for the unskilled migrant to do, labor-wise, it becomes politically easier to say that we should just pay the Third World to stay back home. And lest anyone thing we can succeed without a cost in gold and blood, we will be paying heartily in both.

        ‚ÄúWreaks‚Äù is a much better fit, pedantic hosers!I‚Äôm reading a Mike Hudson interview- he discusses banking in the ancient and classical worlds.He says that past empires fell because they could not bring their asset-stripping oligarchs to heel.He recommends regular jubilees of personal debt, rather than a ban on interest.(He prefers the public-private partnerships of temple/pyramid cultures or interstate highways, but those are also being abused as pools of low cost loans tapped for the political rentiers.)He reinforces the Z-point, ‚Äúwhat kind of society do we want?‚Äù, rather than obsessing over the tools.Also, the ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù empire is a front for it‚Äôs true owners.Note that the Federal Reserve is owned by 8 families, who created the global BIS banks.  It seems someone unnamed provided debt financing to the Roman oligarchs; perhaps that is why a certain country was destroyed, and is now being avenged.

        The EU and Germany in particular are either led by complete fools, or enemy saboteurs. That much is evident from their actions. The economic can may only be kicked down the road so far before they finally are faced with a problem they have to deal with. Salvini is a major problem for them, as Italy is a bigger player than Hungary or Poland.As far as where this goes: Germany (it‚Äôs government at least) seems to want to enter the Russia/China sphere. I‚Äôd be surprised if the populist countries chose that route, their rhetoric generally is geared towards increased sovereignty. That cannot be guaranteed under the American sphere, though, particularly after Trump leaves.

                Perhaps it is suicidal behavior, perhaps they are extremely naive, or even over confident that they can convince the russkies and chicoms of the virtues of unlimited sodomy and Muslims.But in terms of action, they most definitely are cozying up. The Huawei conflict is one of the better examples: you would have to be a fool to accept such tech, knowing full well what it will do. Even though America does it too, we also do sigint and comint sharing with them, which will most definitely end if they let Huawei in.With Russia, it is the LNG deal that I cite as evidence. They also seem keen on Iran. Why are they doing it? Your guess is as good as mine, which is ‚ÄòAmalek‚Äô.

                        Certainly. In short, they are attempting to dominate the 5G market, specifically the hardware that will serve as the network infrastructure. What America‚Äôs IC has been saying is that it will also allow for the Chinese government to fully eavesdrop, as the entire network gives them a Man-in-the-Middle vantage point. Our Intel guys, who currently do multiple things comparable to this, realize the insane risk of letting an enemy eavesdrop on all of a countries communications.

                                MemeWarVet, the Chinese are too smart to openly position themselves as our enemies.  Instead they have been covertly buying up Western tech assets, sold to them by the Clintons and Obama (through Joe Biden, who says ‚Äúthe Chinese aren‚Äôt such bad guys‚Äù).  Look up Loral for a good example.

                        Apple can‚Äôt make product as good and affordable as Huawei so the U.S. government is trying to prevent any western country from buying Huawei‚Äôs products rather than making better products ourselves. Cheating to win or maintain the lead, the new American way. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôd prefer American products are dominant in the marketplace, just not by cheating. Maybe instead of serving their shareholders, Apple should spend more on innovating.

                            Ursula: You do realize one of the main reasons Huawei is cheaper is that they have extreme subsidization from the Communist party. This is a pretty standard tactic for the chicoms, and it is profoundly foolish to favor short term savings over very real threat (that doesn‚Äôt mean I support apple and their sodomy tech).
I suspect the vast majority of people have no idea how serious the threat is.

                                No, what I observe is that the Chinese excel at taking an existing idea and making it better and figuring out how to produce it more efficiently. The government is partner to so many Chinese businesses, that‚Äôs just how they do it. (And as if big American corporations aren‚Äôt subsidized in so many ways by our obsequious government!) But what they do not do is illegally arrest American businessmen while abroad in order to coerce their own products‚Äô market dominance. Perhaps the decline in the quality of our people has given rise to our desperate actions. The U.S. actions have set a dangerous precedent. The U.S. needs to get off its corrupt ass and improve upon what even the Chinese do. This should be a synergy that creates continuously improving products to the benefit of consumers everywhere. Instead it‚Äôs become weaponized political market sabotage. We‚Äôre like the 800-pound gorilla with very sensitive feelings who will often illegally destroy anyone or anything if our sensibilities are offended. If anyone‚Äôs interested, here are a couple of recent pieces on the Huawei situation published at CGTN, which viewpoints of course us westerners will not find in our media. (Yes, I know it‚Äôs biased toward China, but all news is slanted one way or another depending on who‚Äôs publishing it.)https://news.cgtn.com/news/3d3d514d3459544d35457a6333566d54/index.htmlhttps://news.cgtn.com/news/3d3d414d326b544d35457a6333566d54/index.html

                                        Shall we pretend China is not beating us badly on many fronts? Maybe you‚Äôd prefer to cheer on fantasies about the superiority of America. Look at our people and our government ‚Äî you don‚Äôt see that we‚Äôre failing badly? China is doing all kinds of research and innovation in all kinds of industries while it‚Äôs crickets over here, unless you‚Äôre talking about weapons, surveillance, pharmaceuticals or finance. We‚Äôre living on the vestigial greatness of our past, which is evaporating quickly. Bet you‚Äôre one who loves Israel.

            There‚Äôs lots of precedent for  Europe to being led by fools. Think 30 Years War, WWI, WWII for three outstanding examples.
The leaders‚Äô stupidity doesn‚Äôt surprise me as much as the imbecility of the followers. And that holds for today, and not just in Europe.

        Modern politics is about bribing voters with their own money and hoping they won‚Äôt get wise to the scam. Eventually the cost of this bribery (and the incentivizing grift for the pols) becomes too much to bear and the Ponzi scheme collapses in a spectacular and sudden crash and burn event. Usually all of this is preceded by a general degeneration and decline of the population‚Äôs robustness, so the newly arriving hardship tends to be overwhelming and desperation become epidemic. Now the fun begins and it‚Äôs back to the jungle time.

One of my biggest worries is some genius deciding that the nuclear option is acceptable. Ultimately, the balkans did survive. We may not be so fortunate.
Think Rwanda but with all the wonderful stuff the pentagon has cooked up over the years put into play.

The difference between Rwanda and heritage America, is that Rwanda is black, heritage America is white.
It‚Äôll be nice and orderly, a few passes with the gunship to make our point and off you go. No cattle wagons, clean, airconditioned busses, and repurposed hotel-camps, until they get shipped off to some shithole country we either invade or buy wholesale.

I  can count three for certain, perhaps another five depending. The count does not include myself, naturally.Have you ever encountered a person who hasn‚Äôt eaten for three days? Have you experienced this yourself? Do you understand what this does to even the most reasonable person, or how far they‚Äôre willing to go to eat?I get that I‚Äôm the new guy, but I‚Äôve been reading this site for quite some time, and generally respect your opinion, which is why I find your nonchalant attitude puzzling.

                                        Meme‚Ä¶you‚Äôre going demented. You‚Äôre obsessed with this Boomer crap and wasting your energy. The Coastal Boomers who are all in on crystals on the table..love every color‚Ä¶DO NOT own guns. They will shriek Racist at the drop of a hat for anything, when they sit on the pot they yell Racist. We Boomers who own guns, you should admire us, dropped the antelope 1 shot through the heart, don‚Äôt give a fat flying frog about being called raaaaacist. We‚Äôll hand over our Boomer arsenals because we‚Äôre F***ing old, don‚Äôt move fast, and what life we have left we‚Äôre not going to waste going down in a hail of bullets for a useless gesture!So RoboCop with gunship hovering bangs on my door and demands my guns, and I stand in my doorway and proclaim Shoot Me after telling the kid next door to start his Iphone filming and post it on Twitter‚Ä¶..Not! My death as a statement will be useless, my neighbors will cower inside, there will be no posting of atrocity on social media, no one will know. Let‚Äôs see you stand in your doorway and get gunned down for nada, wise guy. If you really want a world with no old people, your world will be all the poorer without what the old ones have to contribute.I thought this site is for people to plan, think, prepare and krall together into something greater than ourselves, a world of realism.

                                            If they get to the point of taking out guns, what comes next will be ethnic cleansing Because they have made it very clear, they want us dead and gone.  They will take your white boomer ass, toss it in a boxcar to be dumped in some quarry after putting bullet in your skull as you beg for your life.There really isn‚Äôt any other option other than fighting at that point when they are confiscating weapons.Prior to that you should be figuring out the best way to hurt them, rather than waiting around like a fattened calf for them to collect you.

                                                    The historical record is pretty clear on what happens after confiscation.   The Founders assement of those situations was clear hence a core element of their design of citizen/government relationship.In the couple centuries and change since the historical record of post confiscation ‚Äúsituations‚Äù is quite consistent.
Not much assement required I think.

They‚Äôll drop 3K of their retirement money on a couple of new rifles that they‚Äôll never fire in anger, while prattling on endlessly in the Breitbart comments section about ‚ÄúMuh Constitutshun.‚ÄùI don‚Äôt for a moment believe that statement applies to you, but you also know darn well that serious people like yourself are badly outnumbered by what I just described.Keep up the good work.  Friends can talk through minor disagreements.

                                        The Boomers are too old . The very  youngest are fifty five and while a few of them might join in, hell there were very dangerous Korean War vets at Bundy Ranch , thi is not the Boomers  fightIt is up to younger Gen X, Gen Y and Gen Z to do the dirty workHowever the Right will do absolutely nothing till they figure out what they want to fight for, are willing to die for and what they want power for.Thus far this has been elusive to say the least.Until that happens, unless there is door to door gun confiscation which is looking less likely by the year, they will do nothingHell if the Left wanted to simply eliminate the Right for good they could do it easily, simply trade Federal gun protection for huge amounts of legal immigration from say Africa and Latin America , resettle them into Red States than waitAnd note the Chamber of Commerce would eat this right  up , cheap labor ahoy!A decade or two later, the military is purged of rednecks by a Democrat President and using data science to determine who is Conservative, and note we log everything and let the purges begin.They‚Äôll take heavy casualties and a lot of war toys won‚Äôt work but the Right White would be utterly annihilated .It would take maybe four decades, say from Immigration Reform Act of 65 to Obama‚Äôs First Term

                                            Speaking of Bundy, you guys forget the big fight might very well begin in the West over land use rights. Think of Dwight and Steve Hammond setting a backfire to stop an incoming wildfire, burning 100 acres of BLM land, then being thrown in fed pen Terminal Island for 5 years for arson until Trump pardoned them. As for Bundy, know folks from Overton who know Bundy, he is a bit of a nutter‚Ä¶don‚Äôt know his arguments for not paying fees on range land, but he sure got a crook deal with half the military storming his land and shooting his cattle. Blame Harry Reid for that one, the sheriff was in his pocket. I heard Ol‚Äô Harry wanted Bundy‚Äôs land to sell to Chinese for a solar project.HEADS UP: We may be entering into the land of unintended consequences. Upward of 400 Congolese have crossed the border into Texas.  Ebola anyone!  The left hates us so much they don‚Äôt care what diseases and plagues come with the illegal hoards. This may get out of hand sooner if not later.  That‚Äôs when you prep up.Look online and research Lauricidin and Biocidin for internal products that kill virus, bacteria and mold/yeast, strengthen immune system. Not sick for 3 years, got a nasty flu and it was gone in 3 days..walloped it with said products.

                        They will eventually get your weapons but not in the way you surmise. Door to door confiscation is stupidly unnecessary. When corporations have already shown they are MORE than willing to virtue signal -around- laws, the gub‚Äômint needn‚Äôt lift a finger.Want to do banking, receive a paycheck? You are a registered firearms owner. Turn in that weapon if you‚Äôd like to keep the lights on and eat this month. You would fucking marvel at how fast those weapons vanish. They will do it piecemeal.This ‚ÄòMUH LAST STAND‚Äô fantasy is just that. A fantasy, Range From Fault is right in the assessment. As likely the only person here who has been -in this exact situation-. A hostile SWAT raid on my home looking for my GUNS. I can tell you it is easy to armchair QBack this until there are flashbangs flying around and half a dozen automatic M4s pointed at your face. It ain‚Äôt no kinda fun and I was certainly not willing to martyr myself. For what? To prove a point? Fuck  that, I barely escaped prison.So it is already happening nationwide. Red flag laws, illegal seizures on trumped up charges (my situation), etc etc. But they will put all that aside and simply put so much economic pressure on you, that you will gladly surrender them. This is already happening in real time so you don‚Äôt need much future vision to see the end game.

                            This is why in order to  fix society the Right will have to stop being corporate cock suckers and to understand that government created things like corporations , QUANGO‚Äôs , The Fed  are often more of a threat than the government itselfThere needs to be an easily enforceable chain of responsibility and accountability for every decision at every level  at every single level with enforcement designed to prevent cronies from bailing out croniesThis will require very very smart people to run for and hold office since they can‚Äôt outsource the administrative state to anyone and have to attest that they understand what the regulations were lest they be hangedNot an easy thing to do as your average elected official is socially adept but hardly bright enough to say understand monetary policy or pollution controlHowever in order to maintain a few country it has to be done.As an aside there were two former Republican congressmen killed in the last few days. This sucksIf these were political in origin, it‚Äôs a clear sign the Left has gone to ‚Äúyou play, you pay.‚Äù and is smart enough to go for softer targetsThis is a winning strategy sorry to say, if you risk being shot at any point ever at any time ever    for what you say, wrote, did without trial or limit, it tends to deter action at least after it becomes a common thingAnother thing the Left gets, hell it is their  stock in trade  is collective punishment . Gun control is a form of this and until the Right embraces it, they‚Äôll be on the fail train.Enemy groups, tribes and organizations have to be punished and sometimes destroyed. The ancients understood the friends and family of traitors are traitors too and acted on that.None of us want that but the other side operates by those rules and the same pressures that has caused the Right to start  using things like Rules for Radicals  will inexorably push them in that direction if they wish to live which is something I‚Äôm not sure is the caseCall it in Randian terms, a Return to the Primitive if you like but Marquis of Queensberry rules or as Sam Francis  the Beautiful Loser approach of the establishment Right is going to result in its destructionIts all Game of Thrones shit all the way down and you play that way  win or you die.

                            Most legitimate assessments I‚Äôve seen of firearms ownership in the US ‚Äì put the total numbers somewhere in the 200-400 million range.Yes ‚Äì that‚Äôs a wide range.  But just pick the smallest one.  Even 200 million is an awful lot of piecemeal to dig your way thru.And technology is making confiscation a useless endeavor.  They can do it piecemeal ‚Äì and already have started.  But when they do that , they‚Äôre just driving counter actions.During the Obama administration those counter actions consisted of people buying up every round of ammo and every available firearm every single time anybody even whispered about increased gun regulations.  That‚Äôs when the next wave got started:  3D printing and home building.The ‚Äúbuild your own‚Äù wave seems to be pretty well embedded at this point ‚Äì based on what I‚Äôve seen of the profusion of 80% kits for both rifles and pistols ‚Äì and the sizeable increase in places selling them.If you want to understand how this REALLY works ‚Äì you need to go read thru some of the underground history of guerilla movements and insurrections.  Factories to produce firearms ALWAYS get setup.  I remember reading an article probably 18 years ago now ‚Äì about the little hole in the wall shops churning out AK-47s in the border region of Pakistan next to Afghanistan.   These guys were pounding out AK-47s on dirt floor shops.If the US goes into full confiscate mode ‚Äì then they‚Äôll either have to do all at once (pretty much impossible) ‚Äì or do it a piece at a time.  The piece at a time is the only way they can pull it off ‚Äì and the ‚Äúgun community‚Äù is so paranoid about confiscation ‚Äì that any effort along those lines will just lead to an increase in alternative methods of acquiring firearms.You can look at things like the war in the Balkans during the 1990‚Äôs ‚Äì and the fall of the Soviet Union for further examples.  There‚Äôs videos on Youtube going thru all the firearms that people were carrying around during the Balkan wars.  A lot of it was of WW2 vintage.  I remember reading stories about how after the fall of the USSR ‚Äì it was pretty common for people to be walking around with an AK slung over their shoulder.Where did all those firearms come from?Buried in basements. Buried in barns. Etc.Where did the Jews who fought the Nazis get guns from?I don‚Äôt worry about guns.  The history points to resistance movements always being able to get their hands on firearms.That‚Äôs not the problem.The problem is within people‚Äôs heads.  Which means ‚Äì will they have the will to use them ‚Äì or will they continue to come up with excuses?‚Äù you can never win against a modern army ! ‚Äù LOL

                Probably something closer to the Spanish Civil War, with the Left playing the role of the Communists, except that they will have the establishment and military (at least the top ranks) on its side.  Not sure if we will have a Franco, so it could get quite ugly for us.

            We will leave but maybe not this year and maybe not without some serious civil disorder. Also, the Conservative Party is not the motivating force behind independence; in fact, they have fought tooth and nail to stop it happening and that fight goes on.

                At first (along with I believe our host) I just assumed that the UK would never be allowed to leave the EU.  But now despite all the delays and maneuvering I‚Äôm not so sure.  Yes the Conservative Party does not want  Brexit but it is becoming increasingly clear that they have to deliver it in order to survive.  Their hold on power is intrinsically feeble but made absolute in a practical sense because almost no one with any power, including many of the Labour MP‚Äôs, wants Jeremy Corbin as PM.So I think Brexit might have a chance but only because the Conservative MP‚Äôs will put Party above Country (as they see the interests of their Country).  It‚Äôs a funny old world, isn‚Äôt it.
