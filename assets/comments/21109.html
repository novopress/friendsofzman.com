        Yep. I no longer tolerate leftists or liberals at all. That extends right into my own family. I spent most of my life trying to live with them an finally gave up. They aren‚Äôt worth the hassle.It cost me a great deal of money‚Ä¶ but what price is your sanity?They now fight amongst themselves and turn on each other so maybe I dodged a bullet.

            I don‚Äôt know. I find talking to liberals and leftists interesting in an anthropological sort of sense. I have no trouble concealing my own beliefs, and it‚Äôs an interesting challenge to try to formulate ideas in such a way as to budge their thinking, even if only slightly. Sometimes I even succeed! Fun!But beyond that, it‚Äôs intellectual arrogance to assume you have nothing to learn from your enemies. At minimum, for tactical reasons it‚Äôs a good idea to understand how they think. And beyond even that, nobody is infallible, and sometimes the other side is going to be right about something and your side wrong. There have been occasions when I‚Äôve had a discussion and afterwards found myself less persuaded by my own arguments. If you can‚Äôt see the world from their side then you end up living in a bubble, and are vulnerable to ratcheting purity-spiral madness of your own.

                Your‚Äôs a nice intellectual argument which seems compelling in theory, but not so much when practiced.An ‚Äúexchange of ideas‚Äù as you might term it always depends on a set of premises agreed upon.  In short a shared view of reality/facts.  When one‚Äôs perception of reality is so different from another, there can be little exchange, just exasperation.Living within a bubble aside, no good can come from ‚Äúseeing the world from their side‚Äù when their side is delusional, psychotic and toxic to an extreme.  As Z-man notes, these people use to be relegated to asylums, whereas now they are promoted to heights of power.

                    I don‚Äôt think JEB meant‚Äúseeing the world from their side‚Äù as even a tentative acceptance. But tobeginwith an unshakable belief that ‚Äútheir side is delusional, psychotic and toxic‚Äù is the same kind of demonology that sees us as racist, white privileged, etc.
This isn‚Äôt an argument that all sides are morally equivalent. But JEB is right: sometimes bits of truth are found in unlikely places. At the least, taking account of others‚Äô versions of reality helps put the boot into our opponents.

No-one I knowbeganwith that belief. They have been (often very reluctantly) dragged to that conclusion by decades of ineluctable evidence.
Less of the straw men please.

                    On that final note‚Äîit‚Äôs more like what I recall from the calls where we had to deal with EDPs and AMS patients.  The trick was convincing them to take the ride with nice people in ambulance for a 72 stay in the psych ward.  They had their own reality and you had to get inside it enough to construct an argument that would convince them this was in their best interests.  I see a lot of parallels between a schizophrenic that has gone off meds and fully paranoid and the current crop of Leftists around here that are truly convinced that the ghost of Bedford Forrest and the 7th Invisible Hitler are hiding under their beds.

                    I don‚Äôt so much have a problem with the way they see the world.  It‚Äôs the fact that their way of seeing the world involves changing right and wrong to justify what they want right now.  Give me one set of rules, and lets both play by them.  Anyone who does not bargain in good faith is not worth the effort.  And those small changes you think you can bend them on, wash away like sand under the tide five minutes after you talked to them.

                    Infallible in the Christian, and more specifically Catholic, church does not mean what you think it means.  It applies to specific rulings of church doctrine and has been invoked twice in 2,000 years for beliefs revolving around Mary.  It certainly does not mean the pope is perfect, as the media loves to twist it.  I think the current pope is awful, but distorting church teaching on infallibility is not kosher.

                I have faults, but I don‚Äôt see excessive arrogance and pride among them. I used to love my neoliberal family very very much, and bend over backward to make allowances for them. Then the queers and Marxism and SJW nonsense started in earnest‚Ä¶ and I didn‚Äôt understand them anymore. I tried my best to see something good in them‚Ä¶ but all I saw in them was unhappiness. That, and they wanted to share their misery and inflict it on others. I was deeply hurt when some claimed I was the source of all their misery because I did not support their belief systems. I later heard through the grapevine of them accusing each other of the same thing after I was gone, so who knows.If there is anything to be learned from those people, I will do it from a distance, thank you kindly. If you can keep your ego and emotions away from them, maybe there is something to what you say. As for me‚Ä¶ no way will I ever open myself up to them again.

            I‚Äôve experienced a remarkable turn around in my own attitude towards formerly leftist friends and family members (indicative of a wider cultural change?). Just five years ago, I would tolerate their antics or even censor my own commentary for fear of them deleting me from their friends list; the right has been in an abusive relationship with the left for decades, always playing the peacemaker and trying to make the relationship work. But no more. I‚Äôve mass deleted these vermin and purge anyone who expresses their views. I‚Äôve made it clear to family they will be uninvited from family functions should they embrace leftist bigotry. Support BLM? Gone. Attended a struggle session? We don‚Äôt know each other. Mouthed off about ‚Äúwhite fragility‚Äù? Banned. Have a problem with Western civilization? GTFO and don‚Äôt come back. Blood is usually thicker than water, but not all blood is equally thick.

                I avoid leftists like the plague that they are. The fact that I have several in my family is of no importance, and ultimately, the only difference it makes is that my life is more peaceful and better overall.Calsdad once mentioned quite some time ago here that he often asks himself if his life would be better if some people were just ‚Äúdead‚Äù.  Whether they are dead or not, your life will be much better if you find a way to avoid leftists by making them at least ‚Äúdead to you‚Äù.  Life is short, avoid morons and enjoy it as much as you can.

                One thing I‚Äôve learned from both reading about psychology and observing people is that there are very few people who actually decide what they believe based on any kind of argument.  That might have held during the 19th and part of the 20th centuries when persuasion was often limited to the linear flow of text on a page.   Modern persuasion relies more on attempt to directly activate brain networks associated with pain and fear (to dissuade) or pleasure, security, and reward (to persuade).  Modern audio/visual media bypasses reason and goes directly to those centers.  The ‚Äúargument‚Äù for a lot of what the media saturated person believes is likely to be something like ‚Äútitties, ice cream, fancy car, titties, titties, mansion with a pool, dollar, dollar, exotic vacation‚Ä¶‚Äù.  You literally can‚Äôt argue with that ‚Äì because it‚Äôs not even a coherent thought, just a pattern of rapid-fire stimuli.  Then you come along with your fancy linear argument about history, evolution, math, and economics.  It‚Äôs got no chance.  I‚Äôve often wondered if dissidents would be better off making music videos than posting ponderous articles full of dry facts or even spicy rhetoric.I recently got more involved in FB as I‚Äôve tried to find others to talk to.  I‚Äôve accepted some friend requests from a few people I didn‚Äôt really know.  I‚Äôve started to notice obnoxious BLM and antifa garbage (mostly from women as you might expect) piling up in the feed though and I just automatically unfriend those people.  The likelihood that I‚Äôm going to persuade them of anything is near zero and a big part of the woke doctrine is concerned with ratting out infidels so the less these people know about me the better.

                My timeline agrees pretty much with yours, CL. The change in my Hive was literally a couple months. We used to talk and compromise if necessary‚Ä¶and then they went nuts. The queers and pedos came out, negroes went from black to niggered‚Ä¶ and the women went off the deep end en masse. It was the damnedest thing I ever saw.

                    This has happened quickly. It is almost as if ergot infected the population. Given, there‚Äôs been a 60 year prog creep but the acceleration in the past few years is inexplicable to me. ‚ÄúTolerance‚Äù has morphed into subjugation to the various freaks, which have now become the model citizens of Empire.
There is certainly a full court press in all quarters now that the Left control academia, media, business and government. It reeks of desperation.
I dont think we are going to be allowed a peaceful divorce. Existing outside the utopian ideology cannot be allowed.

        ‚ÄúBarring a great reversal of current trends, it will become clear to a growing number of white people‚Ä¶‚Äù
The problem With this sentiment is that the insanity is mostly afflicting white people.
AntiFa is a white thing.  BLM became a white thing.  Covid hysteria is a white thing.  Etc. and so on.
The coloreds are mostly just props used by good whites to demonstrated their goodness over their bad cousins.

                The blacks and nonwhites are being set up to be the Alawites in our Syria, the Tutsis in our Rwanda- a minority ruling class.

Look at the local mayors, DA‚Äôs, AGs, police chiefs.  Are theyallblack now?

The White Left sees opportunity a-risin‚Äô.  At last, they can quit Starbucks and get arealjob working under the Assistant Deputy Secretary for Minority Transgender Applicant Reviews.

            Our greatest enemy, since at least 1860, has been other whites. Neither the blecks nor (((our other enemies))) have the numbers to carry out what is being done to our people. All of what we‚Äôre witnessing is happening with the enthusiastic support of a certain percentage of whites. I used to think it was a slim majority, but others on comment threads like this one have convinced me that it is a minority whose position is amplified through control of all the media and the institutions.If a day ever comes when it becomes clear to all of us that a majority of whites feels as we do, then God help our traitors and our enemies alike. It might not even matter how few whites are left on that day, or how badly the Browns outnumber us. Unified white people are the last thing they are going to want to mess with.

                                My point is maybe a simplistic one. There may be things that you and I can do without moving to a new location without a guaranteed result. Great resolve is admirable, but it comes at a price. I and many people come to this sight looking for something actionable. Just for me it would make me feel better just to do something, because what is going on is hard to watch.

                                        I respect that. Some may not want to or be able to match your commitment. I think a leader such as yourself could  inspire many to do something even if it were small compared to you. Battles can be won with regular guy‚Äôs and sprinkling of a few leaders.

The price of your people not getting jobs because of the color of their skin?The price of your people being run out of a store because they do not wear a mask of submission?
What will it take for you to find ‚Äúsomething actionable‚Äù ‚Ä¶
There is power in numbers. And that looks like it will mean living in close proximity to one another.

BTW: how old are you?

                                    Lineman and Jimmy, y‚Äôall are discussing the relative merits of acorns and oaks.Jimmy‚Äôs is the first step in personally freeing his life in situ from prog poison. If peace at his threshold is enough for him, cheers. If he can stomach the propaganda and landmines in his workplace, self-censoring in public, and the disruption in his public life by staying amongst them‚Ä¶ plaudits.Lineman‚Äôs is the next to last step. Build a place where that peace and freedom can be expressed and maintained publicly as well as privately.I say the ‚Äúnext to last step‚Äù because neither of you will be allowed to maintain this reality sans eventual conflict.The Leftist demands will eventually cross your threshold Jimmy, in the form of an infected beloved family member, the tax man, or a feral home invader.For Lineman, the fight will eventually be brought to your town border. Your existence will not always go unnoticed or tolerated.The difference is that Jimmy‚Äôs approach is anatomized reality where his direct environs will become increasingly strange and hostile to him. We‚Äôve all seen the old white people that stayed in the once fine neighborhood that became ghettoized. They are the ones  tend their lovely rose bushes by day and shelter uneasily behind their doors when night falls.Lineman‚Äôs plan does not escape the final assault, nor have I ever heard him say it would. It is the chance to face that onslaught surrounded by friendlies. Your tribe. With a plan, unity, and means. Not guaranteed but better than looking out the security bars of your bedroom window at night.Neither is a foolproof final plan but Lineman‚Äôs is the only way forward as a people.  Establish and hold areas ruthlessly. When the forces of the Prince of this World arrive fight together. Fight savagely and behind their lines. Make them wail. This is the only feasible chance we have and it is still chance.

                        Lineman, with all due respect, after a point having the balls to leave is like lefty talking about having the balls to surrender. ‚ÄòIt takes a real man to let a woman lead‚Äô, etc.Retreat is a tactic, not a strategy (at least not a winning strategy).  The right‚Äôs problem today is a lack of leadership owing to strategic retreat, relatively disordered retreat at that. We can‚Äôt come together and fall apart at the same time, and there‚Äôs no way to know our real capabilities until we come together.  Seems to me they‚Äôd still be considerable, even after decades of scattering and abandoning the communities you want to rebuild. I can‚Äôt get my head around how retreat would work out this time.I‚Äôm guessing you think it‚Äôs not yet time to have it out‚Äî fair enough‚Äî but events are forcing the issue.  Fight or flight, it‚Äôs soon time to fight.  There‚Äôs not much left to lose, anyway.

                                Building community is as easy as picking a local bar or joining a club and making friends. I think that‚Äôs how Proud Boys got started, and they‚Äôve made a difference.

                                And remember Dutch, when the fight comes lines are blurred and we blend more than they do.The proud and self-righteous Progressive cannot suppress their speech as their training demands they ‚Äúspeak truth to power‚Äù and ‚Äúsilence is violence‚Äù. You and I have decades of societal training through work and public life of biting our tongues. Holding our thoughts and beliefs behind calm visages.The feral black cannot blend in among us. The blue-haired wine auntie cannot help but advertise her venom. When the fight comes we can move amongst them in their hives. Me the unseen and unnoticed road construction worker. You the unassuming but thoroughly pozzed middle-school teacher out for a bike ride. We can blend but we have teeth.I can speak their speak about white priviledge, systemic oppression and non-binary gender identification. They‚Äôve practically trained all of us for a decade now in new speak. And I can do it with a somber and earnest face while my hand holds the knife hilt beneath my coat.This will not be a redo of the fine and noble lines of bluecoats and graybacks. This will be Bleeding Kansas. Or bleeding New York. Minneapolis. San Francisco. You get the point.

                            Thank you. You got to the point, where I was dancing around the bush. Moving to a place where the Post Office is in the hardware store is safer, but a retreat is a retreat plain and simple. If my idea of cutting off you problem children and grandchildren is no good than what is the plan? Anything we do will involve some discomfort, but please dear God let us do something. A five year old was executed and hundreds upon hundreds celebrated his death. How low can we go until bailing is no longer an option. I think funding is always powerful, cut them off wherever and whenever you can. You can make your own coffee and pack you own lunch. The money saved can be sent off to do good with a compounding effect, such as the Z man or other lessor causes.

                                Jimmy.It appears there are two threads in your discussion. One is making it painful for family members to be stupid. The other, as Lineman discusses, is building community (specifically, relocating to find or build a durable tribe).Building a mote in a city is a tactical and strategic choice. And a valid one, contextually (everyone is different).But we must always count and weigh the cost of these decisions. This has never been more true than now, with the madness spreading across our country.I‚Äôve chosen to uproot and move my family. We don‚Äôt actually know where yet but have narrowed it to 5 states that check our requirements boxes (homeschool law, 2a, taxes, fiscal health, general political bent, regulatory, etc). This decision was made over 24 months. And frankly I‚Äôm frustrated I did not commit to move sooner. We had chickens coming by mail, just finished a 6 year long renovation (yes, my wife is very, very patient), etc. We were building our mote.But when I saw the trends. And felt that tiny voice telling me to escape the mortgage and the Southern black belt NOW, I made the decision to go.We chose to uproot and look for greener pastures precisely because of the cost.The cost of staying in this small Southern city.Make no mistake, I expect the orcs to come knocking in the future regardless of where I plant my family. The difference is I will be surrounded by men I trust and can count on. At the minimum, I‚Äôm going to make it very painful for the progressive cancer to take anything  from me and my family.Not a perfect plan, but better to play the odds of being surrounded by like-minded men in a small town or rural area, than to roll the dice in a city that is already atomizing citizens while preparing for deep enforcement of their madness.

                                    I understand your statement and it is fair. I am guilty of  inadequate discipline in my comments.I live in a rural area and I would like to caution you on the ‚Äúlike mindedness‚Äù of you future home. You will be a outsider for years or maybe forever so go in with your eyes open. They don‚Äôt like change anymore than you do. Just like the city you will need to establish boundaries and enforce them.My point, poorly articulated was to do something now, today, not after the move, or anything else. More will be accomplished with simple tasks that can be accomplished w/o a layered management. My opinion is most movements orchestrated by angry people are destroyed by the same people. This liberal crap will be no different.I can explain to Starbucks I do not want to shop there if the homeless guy sitting next is soaked in his own urine and I do not want you to spit in the cop‚Äôs coffee. I can just stop going. When there are enough of us they will take notice.I wish you well and thank you for you comments.

Firstly, I appreciate your civility and thoughtfulness, Sir.

I do caution you however, to not depend on the Left burning itself down. Sure, the freaks will eventually do so or be brought to heel by their masters. But their masters will remain no matter how they reshuffle their assault troops in the vanguard.

                                        I appreciate the warning about integration. After 14 cities, I have a deep appreciation for navigating as an ‚Äúexpat‚Äù and have a plan to ensure we are seen as community additions, not drains.The bigger point for us is simple. What area of the country offers the most potential to weather the storm well? A city, statistically, offers little potential based on the degree / severity of the decline of the Empire.If we are wrong, our kids grow up in the country and learn a great deal about homesteading. If right, my children are setup to take advantage of future opportunities from a position of strength.

You nailed the heart of the two arguments. Besieged in the heart of the hive where you have no control over city ordinances, taxation or even who enters or leaves your fief‚Ä¶ or amongst your own where financial prospects are less rosey but you‚Äôll have others alongside you and you can make and maintain your own rules and social mores. The choice seems clear to me.

As aside, well done on your plans and endeavors. I salute your efforts. May God hold and keep you and yours.

                    Political mindset is heritable, so no matter the political system there is always a latent threat from leftists in any Western society. We can‚Äôt let the left hang around in the population because eventually they‚Äôd gain power and do something horrible to us, like a Bolshevik revolution that kills millions. Lurking beneath every Western society is the leftist mindset. Get rid of them and society is essentially stable for eternity; no more threat of communist takeover, no need to concern ourselves with antiquated political theories. The problem is biological, not philosophical.*Note: Not advocating anything terrible, just pointing out a few things society could do to better itself. There are moral ways to do this. For example, is it moral to encourage poor people to have children? No, that only hurts the poor, so we should do the opposite. Same with the left.The sad part is that we have the science to make it happen, but we aren‚Äôt embracing it. We can use genetic tests to identify left-wingers and exile them and prevent them from holding government jobs or media positions; we can also pursue policies to lower their birth rates.SE Asian nations are successful because either the genetic predisposition some Whites have for leftism never existed there due to the social environment or they were kept out of power and prevented from breeding centuries ago. I‚Äôm serious about that, too. I mean, think about it. What is the primary, fundamental difference between left and right?Leftists are selfish individualists, and not in the libertarian sense of the word. They are partly akin to psychopaths in the sense that they have practically no empathy towards others, even if they are smart enough to obey the law on average; antisocial personality disorder is believed to be derived from a social strategy that maximizes reproduction with the least effort:trick people into having sex with you and then move on; thus the prevalence of sexual disorders in that group, their above average charm, males being the majority of psychopaths, and their much higher birth rate and lower social attachment and empathy. They maximize their reproductive ability through acquiring resources through pitting rival groups against each other and assuming leadership positions through that conflict (example: BLM ‚Äî white leftist run group using blacks as a shield to enrich themselves).The Right, in contrast, has a different social strategy. They seek consensus; thus, their toleration of dissent and democracy and rejection of safe spaces ‚Ä¶ even if that is now counterproductive. They help themselves through helping their communities. Healthy societies = healthy group members = high reproduction. Conservatism is what happened back when societies were first forming and needed to remain cohesive; the most stable societies had the most descendants, so the genes underlying that social strategy got passed on.Leftism is the Western parasite that evolved after the good times got going, after civilization got started. These sociopaths evolved to pit differing groups of society against each other for their own benefit. In such conflicts, they usually end up benefiting.The Enlightenment, for example, was an attack by Leftist merchants on the established conservative political order, not just some kind of grand humanistic awakening; it was economic and to the benefit of the parasite. Same with the French Revolution. And Red October ‚Ä¶. it‚Äôs all about the left seizing power. In the past, before low birthrates, this meant greater numbers of children for the left as they seized the prime real estate.They are like the parasite that needs a host to survive and pass on its genes. In most cases, the host came first. Then the parasite evolved to take resources from them.Furthermore, some conservatives are religious (if not literally, then culturally ‚Äî i.e. focus on Western Civilization, race / ethnicity and history) which fosters common societal bonds. They are predisposed to law and order. They are reactionary instead of revolutionary, the latter sometimes overthrows societal order. They are more group-oriented (more likely to be into team sports like college football over more individualist sports like baseball). They are more patriotic towards group symbols. They are more likely to volunteer in their communities when it doesn‚Äôt benefit them (firefighters). They are more likely to join the military.Conservatism is about maintaining social order for the greatest number. Liberalism is about tearing it down for the benefit of the few.These viewpoints / social strategies are heritable, and they are incompatible with each other and with modern civilization. The left may occupy positions of power, but that does not mean they deserve them and won‚Äôt crash society with them if given a chance. They need to go. They are a genetic mistake or a bit of outdated genetics no longer useful to advanced society.

                    Weeds spread because the lawn doesn‚Äôt get tended to.  I‚Äôve been renovating my home for 18 years now. A couple of years ago I finally had the time to get to doing over the lawn on part of my property.  Thick layer of topsoil, all nice and level to make a good play area ‚Äì and then plant the grass seed.  At first it came in nice ‚Äì but then the damn crabgrass took over.  I tried pulling it out ‚Äì but it just came in too fast.Recommendation from a lawncare guy was to use crabgrass preventer in the spring.  So that‚Äôs what I did.  Worked like a charm ‚Äì been 3 years now and not a lick of crabgrass.  The lawn stays nice and green even in the middle of the drought we‚Äôre having around here ‚Äì while other lawns are dead.  That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs in thick topsoil and the roots go down quite a ways for the moisture they need to survive no water from the sky.Point here is:  what it took to get rid of the weeds was a carpet bomb approach ‚Äì at just the right time. Now the lawn flourishes ‚Äì and weeds are DEAD.We keep letting societal weeds grow ‚Äì and we actually FEED THEM, so they continue to grow bigger and bigger.I suppose I could have taken the advice from my ‚Äúconservative‚Äù friends and just abandoned my entire home and moved somewhere else and started over again.But instead I decided to kill the damn crabgrass.

                Well said.  I think about what comes next and how to handle these people in a sane system.i don‚Äôt think these people started as unsalvageable. They are the product of being raised with no boundaries. Every time they pushed when they were younger they were never told ‚ÄúNo‚Äù.I think is a reasonable society with well defined and enforced norms, most of these lunatics would be OK. Their energy would have been directed towards other activities.Instead of burning down police stations to protect black people, maybe would work at a homeless shelter.Anyway, these people are a product of a over permissive society and denial of natural law.  Lack of order is not good for anyone.Say what you want about fascism, but at least people know what is acceptable and what is not.

                    Funny, I wanted to save the world until I worked at a homeless shelter and figured out some people don‚Äôt want to be helped. It‚Äôs better to let them die if that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre intent on doing. Some might hit bottom and change when they realize nobody is going to bail them out.

With that said, the people who were ashamed, which was most, deserved the help.

                        You have a grasped a kernel of Truth. Let me fill in the blanks for you. Some people can be saved. some people cannot be saved. You should do triage and focus on the ones that can be saved. A key flaw in the liberal disease is the pathological desire to try to help everybody. Using the Shipwreck analogy, the Lifeboat can only hold a certain number but if a bleeding heart liberal is in charge he is going to try to rescue everybody, the boat‚Äôs capacity be damned. As a result everybody drowns.

                    There‚Äôs another theory, via Dutton and HBD.  These leftists are biologically unfit, genetically mutant flotsam of sexual reproduction that in nature would have died off.  Modern technology and medicine have allowed these genomicly dishygenic cohorts to survive, reproduce, and flourish.  They spout sick and insane things because they are literally sick and insane, genetically incapable of living morally. The requisites of civilization ‚Äì justice, delayed gratification, empathy, responsibility, honesty ‚Äì have a biological component that these vicious mutants lack.It is an ugly, unpleasant truth with uncomfortable ramifications.  But think on it, study it, pray on it, and come to your own conclusions.

        Well said, but at some point normie will have to confront his single greatest fear: being called a racist and not flinching from it. This fear is greater than losing his job, his house, his retirement or even his family, because in the current age, those possessions are maintained by his silence.

            I think that it‚Äôs not simply fear of ‚Äúbeing called a racist‚Äù that‚Äôs the real problem. It‚Äôs that many (perhaps most) normies don‚Äôt want to be racists, by the Left‚Äôs definition of ‚Äúracism‚Äù. They refuse to allow themselves to think race realist thoughts.

        Therereally, likereally, needs to be a central repository of all incidents of anti-white violence as they are growing so fast nobody can keep track of them all. I know about White girl bleed alot (Flaherty) but I don‚Äôt think his site is comprehensive. I‚Äôm talking about a full catalog including date, time, incident description, and in a perfect world video to go with articles.This is the most suppressed thing in this country currently. The epidemic of black on white violence which is going to get MUCH worse. It is critical people have access to it.Related: Leftists have entered full 1984 mode. Goldstein who was a fictional character for the 2 minute hate is now a combination of Trump and ‚Äòracists‚Äô who are hiding behind every tree waiting to grab a mailbox and hiding under the beds of lefties. And just like the party devoted in 1984 most of them aren‚Äôt faking.They truly believe in the face of overwhelming contrary evidence that the couple thousand WN type people left are the real threat. Let‚Äôs not pay attention to the literalmillion women armythat BLM/Antifa musters every weekend when taken in aggregate across all American cities.Opposite Rule of Liberalism indeed. That needs to become a mantra because it is true in nearly all cases. We are an unserious country with apex first world problems. We have a presidential election featuring a narcissistic reality show host, a doddering dementia patient, and a f-cking rapper as the 3 top candidates. That is, by definition, an unserious country. Clown World is here to stay, and some day the bill is going to come due when actual serious countries realize this.Lastly, divorce is not a good analogy for our situation because if you go to file for divorce in real life you work it out between two lawyers sometimes amicably sometimes with hostility. What does NOT happen, is when you file to divorce your lunatic wife a SWAT team shows up at your house and at gunpoint tells you that ‚Äòyou aren‚Äôt going anywhere‚Äô, because this crazy bitch still needs your money, resources, and sanity. She isn‚Äôt done torturing youjust yet.These people are not going to let you peacefully separate and nobody has the testicular fortitude to face the real cost of separation which will be measured in pain and blood. So bake the f-cking cake bigot, and like it‚Ä¶

            Correct.  It‚Äôs not a divorce, it is a gang war.  Calling it a divorce means that the parties can work it out in a mediated environment.  A gang war simply has to expend itself until nobody is willing to fight any more. So, which is it, hmm?

            Besides theOpposite Rule of Liberalism, the late Lawrence Auster coined a term for what has become even more prevalent nowadays: ‚Äúthe black intifada.‚Äù I guess he was comparing black criminal behavior to the Palestinian uprisings, which as an Israel apologist he detested. But at least his phrase included the idea that anti-white violence was a wide phenomenon, not just a few wackos.

            I missed the riots by about 2 miles last night coming into Portland last night, but at the end of the ramp, a huge sign:B**** L***** M*****
Here in Seattle, the radio‚Äôs talking about the Portland driver video.  Black rioters assault the white guy, a white homeless lady says stop and gets beat up, then they are punching his white female passenger as the well known blacktivist drop-kicks his head.
That sign, B.L.M., made ask, ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù.Because if you give the normal answer, ‚Äòbecause all‚Ä¶‚Äù, you‚Äôll get fired if you‚Äôre a public figure, or shot in the head.

        The USA is now a 55% white country. It‚Äôs starting to behave like one. It‚Äôs genetically encoded. Inevitable.

The riots, the blackouts, the violence, the corruption, are exactly what happens in a 3rd world country.

Keese Love will probably get off with a slap on the wrists. Whites will whine about how the justice system is failing. Well yeah, that‚Äôs what happens in non white countries.

There were probably dozens of instance of mulatto violence in Brazil yesterday. They just segregate better. Demographics are destiny.

            What the victim needs to do is sue Keese‚Äôs employer.  Keese was wearing his uniform, and therefore was its apparent agent.  He should state that he complied with the requests not to flee or fight because he believed Keese was there to maintain security through his employer, and his employer was negligent in allowing Keese to take his uniform home and use it for nefarious purposes rather than provide the uniform at work site only.  This was a foreseeable misuse, and to save a buck on laundry and changing facilities, his employer decided to put the public at large at risk by unleashing this animal upon them dressed in the employer‚Äôs colors.

                    Maybe, but now Keese is unemployable.  Any one who would hire him has prior knowledge of his violent tendencies and he would be too high a risk.  A lawsuit would get coverage and make that knowledge more widespread.  I am sure his current employer may not want that kind of publicity either.  What business would hire its guards, knowing they present that type of risk?

        I haven‚Äôt had a discussion about politics with my sister, who I‚Äôve considered moderately leaning left, for a few years. We generally get along fine and both avoid those topics until recently, where I brought up the destruction of Minneapolis.I was surprised to find out she‚Äôs more extreme than I thought, when she praised authors like Nikole Hannah-Jones and Ibram X. Kendi (‚ÄúHow to be an Antiracist‚Äù). Of course I laughed and said those people are horrible and that they spread anti-white hate. She also reads the NYT and loves their columnist Tom Friedman.I brought up the usual racial crime stats, race difference information, and generally wore her down with information she wasn‚Äôt aware of, which led to her asking ‚Äúwhere do you get your information?‚ÄùThat‚Äôs when we both agreed that we‚Äôre living in different universes. She knew nothing about our world, although I was aware and familiar with the Oprah/NYT/CNN-type of info she was reading and listening to. She had never heard of who we think of as somewhat well-known pundits like Michelle Malkin or Stefan Molyneux. I asked her if she knew what was going on in South Africa. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she replied.That led to me explaining how whites are becoming a minority and likely a ‚Äúdespised minority‚Äù in the US and the West, and described all the videos I see daily where white people are assaulted and beat up by gangs of blacks.That‚Äôs where she got really quiet and seemed spooked. Maybe something to do with her white grandchildren? When the Great American Split happens maybe my sister and I don‚Äôt have to be on opposite sides. Maybe, but not counting on it.

        ‚ÄúHow does one even talk to someone who thinks the post office is out to get them? How can you even have a conversation with someone that is sure the Russians rigged the last election? Within living memory people like this were involuntarily committed to lunatic asylums.‚ÄùI am here with another case study to treat the above.Living in the Occupied Territories of New York, I have dealings with all manner of liberals as a matter of course of doing business and so on. There is no avoiding them.One is a low millionaire, say worth about $10 million. Lives in a large mansion, huge property, on the best street in town. He has been as vocal an anti-gun guy as I have ever met in person, and that over a span of more than 20 years.The guy recently announced that he had purchased his first firearms. Two shotguns, one each for him and his wife. Being a monetarily successful liberal, he was, of course, an instant expert on the subject. Said they were going to ‚Äúgo to school‚Äù, and when I mentioned the nearby range where I frequent, since he was not aware of it, in true liberal fashion, because he never heard of it questioned if it even existed.I gently asked him, as one does when querying monetarily successful liberals, if he thought antifah was ‚Äúcoming for you?‚Äù He said, stridently, ‚Äúno, I am worried about angry Trumpers!‚ÄùGuy then says, ‚Äúif the government says we have to hand in our firearms, we will be the first in line!‚ÄùSo if a monetarily successful, well educated liberal has a brain that is so devoid of logical facilities as this example, there is no manner of Freudian talk therapy, or Ben Shapiro-ist ‚Äúfacts‚Äù that are going to reach them.

            Another key to his idiocy was his choice of a one-size-fits-all weapon.  Wonder what this blowhard will do when he confronts a combatant beyond 30 yards?  Those in the Occupied Territories would do well to get non-scary ‚Äúhunting‚Äù weapons ‚Ä¶ my recommendation is a lever gun in .357 or 30-30.  There‚Äôs no one ‚Äúright‚Äù answer, but lots of wrong answers.

                IMO the crowd that showed up on the McCloskey‚Äôs front lawn shook him up. In any case, what passes for Castle Doctrine laws in the OToNY means you have to remain indoors, wait for an assailant to enter your premises, before brandishing or deploying a firearm.It was all fists in the air liberal boiler plate from my guy until some other rich guy felt the heat from the mob. As in the word ‚Äúgun‚Äù was never uttered without ‚Äúnut‚Äù.Despite proclaiming, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to school‚Äù the odds are more in favor of an assailant taking said guns away from our valiant liberal and his wife and using them against them ‚Ä¶ then they are in favor of a successful home defense ever taking place.

                    True.  You know what‚Äôs often lacking in these elementary training schools is the psychology of conflict.  Combat training for high-adrenaline scenarios requires a great deal of muscle-memory, practiced situational awareness, and continual war-gaming of potential threats (i.e. playing the ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù game).  It also gets complicated when you start to assess the myriad of potential threats ‚Äì long/intermediate/short range, combat capability of adversary, etc.  All that to say ‚Ä¶ your liberal friends are late to the party, and he‚Äôs probably more likely to get sodomized with it then anything else.  And he‚Äôll deserve it.

                        Successfully using a firearm for self and home defense scenario does not require advanced mall ninja tactics training.  Untrained people successfully use firearms this way thousands of times a year.  Guns WERE designed to be simple and intuitive to use by any dim bulb you can conscript.  The whole ‚Äútraining‚Äù fetish plays into the hands of gun grabbersFurther ‚Äì The idea that drawing a weapon should automatically mean someone dies is also gun forum nonsense.  There ARE people who will run toward someone pointing a gun at them (a famous jogging jogger comes to mind) but this is not typical.McLoskeys‚Äôs demonstrated this as well as police who routinely aim firearms at perps but almost never fire them.  This is typical in civilian encounters also.  Yes someone SHOULD be prepared to fire if they need to, this is not the same as saying firing is ALWAYS necessary or correct.If the current legal climate hasn‚Äôt made it obvious, whites and other disfavored people need to be extremely careful about escalating any conflict.

                            Let me put it more simply ‚Ä¶ using a firearm requires mental preparedness.  Nailing a target‚Äôs 10-ring is different then training for conflict.  Marksmanship and weapons familiarity are worthless if the gun owner hasn‚Äôt thought through Rules of Engagement.
Good luck with your untraining plan ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure it will work out for you, until you find yourself in a crisis, at which point your knees turn to jelly, adrenaline courses through your veins, and your last thought is ‚ÄúHoly Sh‚Ä¶‚Äù

            Prior to WWII Communism was all the rage among college educated whites in this country, They thought it was the way to go, Had they had the numbers they would have voted in Communism. As it was many of them actually went to Russia to help[ Stalin.Go to Silicon Valley today and you‚Äôll find all sorts of cults with membership rosters that read like a who‚Äôs who of Big Tech.Remember the Baghwan Ranjeesh? His cult was composed of college grads and students who gave him everything. They even tried to murder the inhabitants of a Oregon town to take it over.Intellectuals are not grounded in the least and best their grip on reality is tenuous and this makes them dangerous and gullible.

                I have a Baghwan story. Early eighties. I was working an ICU in the old Army hospital that used to be in San Francisco. A retired Colonel came in who had had a heart attack.Couple days later he had a visitor, an attractive young (early twenties) woman who asked to see him. She was not immediate family and so it was appealed to me whether he could have a visitor. I asked her how she knew him.She said she didn‚Äôt know him but that the Baghwan had sent her to have sex with him and that that would heal his heart.Turns out he was a cult member, a fund-raiser, and had kept up his military appearance. She was turned away and he got better the old fashioned way ‚Äì without doing strangers in the ICU bed with everyone watching.

                    I co-taught a graduate Unix course, once, with Dennis Mumaugh. (self-dox) He was former Unix agency dude for NSA, chief of unix, yeah, those guys, National Security Agency.
Dennis lived on a commune. In his sixties when I taught with him, he was a barely functional autist. A real socially-inept dickwad of not particularly creative talent. Automaton in the lingo.
A white wrench-monkey capable of installing a Detroit engine would have dwarfed Dennis in anything other than an abstract exercise. 0.02

                It is so much worse than that.  Contemporary newspaper articles and other ‚Äúnews‚Äù coverage is largely what forms the basis of history along with some ‚Äúprivate‚Äù diaries and the like.  In 2100, the only thing that will left to tell our story is contemporary newspaper articles, CNN and the ‚Äúprivate‚Äù of people like Omar and AOC.  This is how they write the history of tomorrow, today.  It is how the narrative shifted about the ‚Äúcivil rights era‚Äù and then current antifa became known as the non-violent ‚Äúfreedom riders‚Äù  It is how Emit Till went from whatever really happened (he dindu nuffin) to the ‚Äúcivil rights‚Äù martyr.This is why they print such insane stuff full of obvious lies.  The lies are only obvious to us, here in the present.  We experience the milieu of present day and know what things are really like day to day. 100 years from now, the people will be as remote as 1920 is to us. Just as we rely on contemporary newspaper, newsreels and other information sources of 1920, so too will our posterity rely on our current day media.

                    I‚Äôve always had a real distaste for all that zombie crap. Probably 10-12 years ago now I got in a huge pissing match with people on a gun forum I frequent because I started giving people a huge amount of crap for constantly using the whole zombie thing as a go-to when talking about lefties and their gun grabbing ways.
They all thought they were being smart by using the zombie thing as some sort of cipher ‚Äì but the reality was they were just refusing to confront reality and call it for what it was.

            I‚Äôve been surprised by that too but what I‚Äôve also found very interesting is that diversity is going to save us. White people are extremely obedient to Authority but no one else is so we‚Äôre having lockdowns and the cities are burning but in New Zealand and Australia it‚Äôs all locked down, police state,  New Zealand even canceled the elections. Too many white people not enough diversity. That‚Äôs irony

            I disagree. TDS makes everything the President‚Äôs fault. Even if he loses, EVERYTHING will continue be his fault, until the next Republican takes the White House. And if there is never another? Then forever more, Orange Man Bad.This sounds ridiculous, but I have friends in a blue city who blame all the worlds evils on Trump. They think it‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs undercover army secretly doing the looting and rioting, so that people will blame the democrats. I do not kid you.

                        Reminds me of a guy I worked with many years ago. We worked second shift ‚Äì and the next day at work everybody was asking him ‚ÄúMark what happened ‚Äì you crashed your car leaving last night?‚Äù.His response was ‚Äù I don‚Äôt know what happened ‚Äì the tree just jumped right out in front of me‚Äù.Mark was a moron ‚Äì he was always doing stupid shit ‚Äì and that whole ‚Äútree just jumped out in front of me‚Äù comment just rubbed me the wrong way.  So I said to him: ‚Äù I know what you mean ‚Äì when I left those damn trees were running back and forth across the road ‚Äì I almost hit one of them myself!‚Äù.He was pissed.  But at least he didn‚Äôt keep on with the whole ‚Äútree came out of nowhere ‚Äù crap he was trying to peddle. I think he got the point I was trying to make.So no ‚Äì it‚Äôs not the tree‚Äôs fault in any sense. It‚Äôs YOUR fault ‚Äì since you were driving the damn car.  Last time I checked the Ents are fictional.

                I have seen this sentiment all over Reddit, which is excruciatingly liberal. They‚Äôre absolutely convinced that the looters are fascist agitators inserted to sully the media‚Äôs portrayal of otherwise peaceful protests.
I‚Äôm reminded of the movie theater analogy I once read. Normal people and leftists are sitting in the same theater watching the same movie, but we walk out having seen two completely different films. There‚Äôs no more conversation to be had.

                    Can vouch for that‚Äîcolleagues who were dedicated ‚Äúcity people‚Äù are leaving‚Äîeven if only to rented homes in the suburbs.  We‚Äôre now making exec hires that would have been NYC elsewhere.  Explained to my BIL while on a trip down south this weekend that no firm is going to stir up ire by announcing they are leaving‚Äîinstead will simply gradually move people out or allow them to relocate at will so long as a good airport is nearby.  In a few years NYC finds out a critical mass of six and seven figure residents are permanently gone.

        Perfect.This has many names: permanent revolution, terminal instability, cold civil war. I like your choice of ‚Äúdivorce,‚Äù because it is clearly about to be filed. The Empire soon willde factoseparated.De juredissolution will be the end result. I will not do the search, but it was only a year or so back you did not see that happening. I only became convinced of it three or so years ago. Some of the Dissident Right 1.0 saw it decades ago. The last to accept the inevitable will be the CivNats, and that will happen only after disruptions of their personal lives become undeniable.The Post Office conspiracy is profoundly insane, and has forced many Americans to acknowledge many of their countrymen are not worth the trouble let alone taxes and war. It may be that it is so ridiculous it cannot be ignored. There was a history of conflict with Russians and political corruption such as the Ukrainian allegations, so wild and unbelievable as both were they had some basis. The Post Office conspiracy, though, is the stuff of madhouses.Regardless of how this upcoming election ends, the curtain started to fall when the Left orchestrated and coordinated state-sponsored domestic terrorism against political enemies. Those of us here know it has been part and parcel of the War on Whites for half a century. The violence has awakened a far wider segment of the population than anything we could have done.The United States is done.

But the chineese rulers don‚Äôt hate a large population the way it is in the west. All their abuses are for profit. and if you tried toorganize drag time story hour at a chinese elementary school, it It doesn‚Äôt bear thinking about what would happen to you.

        I crossed the national divorce divide over a decade ago, but the reality is that America won‚Äôt split up until the dollar loses its reserve status. That‚Äôs probably at least 20-50 years away. There are no viable contenders for a reserve currency and none on the horizon.There is a third way out of our national situation that is viable and can avoid the otherwise inevitable civil war. The fundamental problem of American politics is that, from a political perspective, America is a sea of Red that looks like this:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/upshot/election-2016-voting-precinct-maps.htmlRed dominates the map, but after the Trump interregnum we will be governed permanently by the small islands of Blue on the map. The solution is to allow periodic plebiscites redraw state boundaries by allowing Red counties to leave their Blue states and join a Red state, preferably an adjacent Red state.This would have been unthinkable twenty years ago, but I no longer believe it is so. Our political differences are so great they can no longer be bridged. Blue hates Red. Red hates Blue. A national divorce will involve a civil war and economic collapse, which benefits nobody.Under this model the Blue states will collapse to urban enclaves which can function as city-states, much like ancient Greece. California will be a strip of land along the coast with fingers extending inland. Oregon will comprise Portland and the surrounding area. Washington will comprise Seattle and the surround area.When I look at the map in the link above I simply don‚Äôt understand what people on the Right believe is worth fighting about. The geographic areas in Blue are urban hellholes filled with people who are completely foreign to me. I would hate them but hate is itself a form of caring, and I can‚Äôt be bothered to invest that emotional energy in them. (I do love watching their cities burn though.) Every good General knows that war is settled or avoided by ceding lost territory. The territory in Blue is lost and is not worth fighting over. Cede the Blue territory to the Left in exchange for the Red territory and let them burn theirs to the ground.

            I think we need to seriously look at means of peaceful separation. I think theoretically this could be done on state by state basis with a ratification at the county level, so that each of the ~3400 counties in the country have a say in which philosophy/system they wish to align with. That process will result in the Blue Archipelago and Red Landmass.The Blue enclaves fight this, because they know that over time they will be VERY vulnerable from a variety of angles, particularly when currently they control the vast majority of the institutions, media, and now large-scale commerce and industry.This is why the gun control move MUST come if they get complete control of the government. I think the controllers and shot-callers in the culture and institutions can see that things are fracturing, and these Blue enclaves are almost completely dependent on the red areas. Thus the propaganda and gaslighting and bread and circuses continues apace. Trying to keep the pot from boiling over.It‚Äôs not going to work that much longer. The systems are working for fewer and fewer groups, and fairly soon the elite will be forced to acknowledge this. Heritage America is not going to tolerate its parasites creating chaos, mayhem, murder and arson and then being blamed for it and then handed the bill to rebuild.

                There will be no peaceful separation. Everyone has the point at which they exercise their personal mental escape clause, to describe their own ‚Äúout‚Äù from what we face. Build a community, but they will come for them. Let them burn their own cities down, but they‚Äôll burn yours down next. Avoid the bad part of town at night, but they will do the same thing in the good part of town, during the day. Split the country, but that‚Äôs not how it will go down, because the ‚Äúsword of righteousness‚Äù will be swung in the direction of the other side, across the new borders. There is no separation, only resolution. One side or the other wins, even if it is over a smoking ruin. The day you accept that is the day you free yourself from your own mental escape clause, and enjoy your life as it is given to you, one day at a time. Because you will either learn how to enjoy each day, or drown in despair on the black pill. An escape clause is simply a way station on the way to one or the other.

Maybe that inspires you as rhetoric but it‚Äôs factually incorrect.  Human populations have sorted themselves out into racial/cultural/religious affinity groups innumerable times throughout history.
It‚Äôs much more common than these last stand Helm‚Äôs Deep extermination wars a certain sort seems emotionally drawn to.

        I generally don‚Äôt try to talk to any leftist about anything political now days. We are just too different in our world views. I will say that I don‚Äôt think most whites will divorce from leftism or the feminist/black zeitgeist.Its gonna be 50/50 at best for any kind of white awakening to our fate.As long as life is decent and the 401k is growing  and the Federal Reserve can paper it all over.

let me get this straight. You can‚Äôt post a freaking letter from your own private post box, in front of your own damn house? You have to take the damn letter to the post office yourself? That‚Äôs nuts. Why the hell do people in your town put up with kind of crap?

Meg Whitman is criticizing Trump‚Äôs business acumen as part of a ‚ÄúRepublican‚Äù women bashing Trump and endorsing Biden feature of the Democrats convention.  In addition to her own well documented business failures, Whitman let noted campaign consultant and perennial loser Mike Murphy steal a couple of million from her leading her campaign to 41% of the vote when she ran for Governor of California.  The elites are not only stupid, they think they are the smartest people to ever live.  What would it take to humble them?

                I think you are right.  I didn‚Äôt know what Meg Whitman was doing now, since that NBC article didn‚Äôt bother to mention her job, so I looked it up.  She is the CEO of Quibi, a premium streaming service started by Jeffrey Katzenberg that in spite of getting $1.75 billion in start up capital, apparently has no audience.  She is blaming the lack of demand on people traveling less due to Covid and not watching on their phones while they use public transportation.  After a lifetime of business failures, wouldn‚Äôt you at least start to suspect the problem might be you?https://www.vulture.com/2020/07/is-anyone-watching-quibi.html

            I smell Javanka in that one.  Of course, this is the guy that cited wikileaks many times during the 2016 campaign, and upon election denied ever having heard of them.  I‚Äôve seen the film from the C‚Äôville accident.  Fields hit the brakes. The woman who died was &lt; 5‚Ä≤ tall and weighed more than 300 lbs.  That‚Äôs nose tackle territory and she was no athlete.  She was not long for this world under optimal circumstances.

        Nailed the divorce analogy.  We‚Äôre still at the stage where one partner maintains the fantasy that the relationship can be made to work.  But the point will come when that runs out.  Not sure what it will take or what will be the catalyst.  So far those that still adhere to the Conservative Inc pablum have been willing to endure almost any level of abuse.  But like a lot of the ‚Äúfix its‚Äù I‚Äôve worked on in the corporate world over the years, question of whether the turnaround takes hold before the cash runs out.  Then the outcomes suddenly diverge, dramatically.

        Z: ‚ÄúThe legacy Right argues that these antics are just part of the Left‚Äôs scheme to gain power and impose their Marxisms on us. This is a recurring theme of Tucker Carlson‚Äôs nightly monologues. The Left just wants power!‚Äù  I guess Dissident leaders have a need to show that no guy on TV could possibly be on their level of wokeness.  Tucker‚Äôs overriding theme is the existential crisis facing whites.  He couldn‚Äôt be more emphatic, or indeed, dramatic about it.

        The funny thing is, it is normally the cucks that like to hate on the post office.  It is one of the few things the federal government is supposed to be doing.  They support all kinds of stuff for which there is not even a tenuous connection between the constitution and this thing they are doing, while opposing the government doing what it is supposed to be doing.

        It‚Äôs not a divorce, it‚Äôs a gang fight. The Blues on the left pretty much owned everything, and shook everyone down with the promise of keeping things sort of peaceful.  Then Trump showed up to pump up the Red gang.  Now politics is true Bloods-Crips, or Jets-Sharks.  As politics has infiltrated everything, all of our culture is subsumed into the gang fight.  You picks your sides, you fights your battles.  There is no nobility or inherent good in gang fighting.  It is simply survival of the strongest, and all tactics will be used in the fight.  There are no boundaries, and nothing is off-limits.  Women and children will be pawns, and will be sacrificed.Gangs will posture, and use any ridiculous argument to further their aims.  The job of the members is to accept and promote what they are told, even if it makes no sense.  It‚Äôs how you stay in good graces with the gang.  Trump rightly recognized that the Red gang had no direction, no pull, and was getting wiped out.  He resurrected the Red side.  When we participate in the political system, we are choosing sides and fighting for turf, no more and no less.  If you are looking for something noble and lasting, you will find it away from the gang battles, in your own home and community, which is your sanctuary from all of this.  That‚Äôs why BLM is going to people‚Äôs homes and neighborhoods now, they are out to destroy any sanctuary from the gang wars, at least on our side.Your vote, as little and meaningless as it is, is a testament to your gang affiliation.  It is a token gesture, fairly safe and mostly meaningless.  There are two other important elements.  One is to set up your own sanctuaries, and the other one is to do your part for your gang.  In the end, people will probably need to do a bit of both.  You can‚Äôt have one without the other.

                        It‚Äôs not about white people it‚Äôs about the right kind of white people.You do realize there are perhaps only three million folks like us, awakened, total in the entire country, right? Who don‚Äôt instantly shrink when accused of racism? Maybe two dozen who actually own a wall display of Lincoln Rockwell? If that.We need to start with a broad base and then implement the winnowing selections. Not the reverse ordering unless you intend to create a single small gated housing subdivision in which instance I say more power to you. Since that‚Äôs all you will achieve.The plains are full of dense midwestern types.Have you visited Southern California recently? Oh wait, you live there ‚Ä¶ in no place in the US are there more vacuous, weird ‚Äúnormal‚Äù white people/mystery meat than in Southern California. Inarguable. Next.Also, I feel dutybound as a trained engineer to point out that ‚Äúdense midwestern types‚Äù generally make for the most insightful engineers and scientists. We might wanna few of them to help us build and innovate.AK is a bunch of burned out drunks and eskimos on welfare.You have a point there. Still, it‚Äôs Alaska and I have a personal attachment to the place. Especially when I‚Äôm on a bender. Next.A lot of these ‚Äúfreest of the free‚Äù type places are meth head welfare dens.Flamethrowers.You have failed to persuade me but FWIW I value your scrivenings here and there. A lot. Carry on and mind the gap.

                        My faith is that if we controlled the culture then many of problems with whites could be mitigated.  Of course, you can‚Äôt fix bad genes but what I want to end is the ability of our enemies to hijack white gullibility and turn it towards ethnomasochism.

                            Whiteness is only part of the equation.  You need quality control.  Whenever I‚Äôm in the South, even though I know they‚Äôre generally more conservative, I‚Äôm in an alien place.    Same thing for the Northeast.  I just don‚Äôt like them them as as soon as I land.  Something inside me wants to punch them.  Especially Bostonians.  PA people tend to grow on me.  I don‚Äôt know why.  Being around ‚Äúyour own‚Äù is more than skin color.  It‚Äôs certain cultural esthetics.

                                I guess, but obviously don‚Äôt know, that you feel more comfortable in almost any white city than any non-white city.  That‚Äôs what we must build upon.
I understand your sentiment but we are going to need some sort of white federation or we‚Äôre all going to be snuffed individually.
We need to allow whites to sort themselves within the framework of a common defense pact.

                    I‚Äôm on the other side of that line heritage-wise. I tend to agree with you however. It‚Äôs important for us to get control of the mid-Atlantic seaboard states across through the Midwest including all of the Great Lakes region out to Iowa. Any power that controls this territory calls the shots in North America.It‚Äôs more complicated than that, however. Whites and non-whites are never going to reach an amicable ‚Äúdivorce.‚Äù We‚Äôre going to have to take the territory we want and assign (blacks especially) the rest. The alternative is they take what they want and give us ours. There‚Äôs no in-between.And White Southerners are never going to give up the entirety of the old South, anymore than you would give up yours. But in both north and south, east and west, we can give up districts (places we‚Äôve already ceded btw, just look at a map of blue vs red voting districts). We can formalize into law that de facto separation in a checkerboard pattern across the country.Also, acknowledging that this may not be an ideal solution, it may only be a stage in the process of separation, but let‚Äôs get there first, the first step agreeing on this arrangement.We‚Äôre not even close to taking that first step.Making it happen is still a distant dream.

But they‚Äôve surrounded themselves with negroes, as have I temporarily. It‚Äôs unfair, and if they wish to stay and fight, as I expect to fight against decent odds, then at least in spirit I will support them including with my prayers. But southern climes offer too easy transport and living. It‚Äôs the geophysical north we need to occupy and defend, joining Alberta and driving out to sea to feed the fishes the Chinese and others occupying, temporarily, the Canadian coastline south of Alaska. Then we have something sustainable ‚Äî FOR US.

        My son is a postal carrier. By and large I think the carriers are people who look for ways to minimize their work in order to end their day early, and I guess I can‚Äôt blame them. The management  can‚Äôt find their asses with both hands. They‚Äôre not competent to schedule maintenance on 1980s/90s trucks, to the point they send trucks out with bald tires, non working windshield wipers, burned out headlights / taillights, etc. They‚Äôre certainly not competent to rig an election for Trump. Anyone who thinks that truly believes that government is efficient, and is here to help.There will be individual carriers that believe in the communist cause though, and will stuff dem ballots or hide ballots from republican areas. I hope the postal inspectors find them and put them in federal pound me in the ass penitentiaries.

            I don‚Äôt find it punishment, tbh.
More like an exorcism. Our problems have been building up for a long time. The entire latter 20th century was a huge cope, on a spiral towards death. You could teleport back to 1985 and we‚Äôd still be in the same place today.
Depressing would be being a boomer in the 1990s, bluepilled beta, divorced, empty materialist. We are men, we are living, and the chips will fall where they fall.
Our people will either wake up, or go extinct.

            Because our country was hijacked by a hostile alien tribe and a native ruling class that had morphed into cosmopolitan globalists who systematically gutted and invited ruin upon our land and people in the name of profit and hate.I could see this happening almost 40 years ago with the LBO‚Äôs that began the destruction of old school American businesses and industry and how it was cheered on by our elites and the white professional class.Then came NAFTA that further eviscerated Middle-America.Why didn‚Äôt we fight back? Because the elites controlled the press and info flow. Not to mention they attacked any attempt whites tried at organizing.At the same time whites were kept sedated by a constant flood of bread and circuses in the form or pro-sports and orc worship., We were fed a constant stream of lies that progress meant destruction of jobs, community and land.  You know the old Greed Is Good mantra.What happens next is entirely up to us. We can continue to let a freak show and their white enablers(cops, gov contractors,Big Tech) destroy us or we can begin to fight back.

        It‚Äôs also an experiment in just how many barren women become mentally ill by their 40s.  The ones who engage in empty consumerism at Nordstrom and have a few too many Martinis at the end of the night are actually the most mentally balanced ones.

Most white men worth marrying / fvcking moved out. I‚Äôm sure wahmen have zero understanding of this, being wahmen.

                        I find mulattos to be very 1970s.  There was a wave of them in my age group.  The liberated 70s woman wanted to bang them after smoking some grass with Earth Wind and Fire playing in the background.  They had a searing hate for their fathers.  I‚Äôll show him!  Today‚Äôs mud sharks are so butt ugly that the black guys are mostly getting tatted marshmallow women who have a burning self hatred.

            I was wondering about that.  For a lot of sites with enough resources to have a legal department, but not enough to adhere to global (EU) ‚Äònet regulations it‚Äôs easier just to block them (or be blocked).  I know my fix for my company‚Äôs website was to just turn off tracking since we never used it for anything.

Next thing you know, the locals are ‚Äúracists‚Äù and the local liberal whites are bending knees. The local ‚Äúchristian‚Äù churches are pledging support. Townspeople are set against one another. There is strife, including inter-generational hatred raised up by the agitator and its useful idiots..‚ÄúHylton-Patterson said she has been to anti-racist protests in Ferguson, Missouri, New York City and Washington, D.C., over the years.‚ÄùSelf-convicting that the agitator is, indeed, a professional.‚ÄúGabby Goodman was leading protest chants‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄúIt‚Äôs terrible. I have black children ‚Ä¶ that I plan to raise here,‚Äù Gabby said. ‚ÄúThis needs to be a place where they‚Äôre accepted.‚Äù‚ÄùWhy is the term ‚Äúmulatto‚Äù never used?‚Äú‚ÄúJust because we don‚Äôt see it every day in front of our eyes here ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs happening,‚Äù Kiana Roach said. ‚ÄúWe all have to show up.‚Äù‚ÄùWhat‚Äôs with these names? The ‚Äúgoodman‚Äù is literally a good white. And this ‚Äúroach‚Äù, is this some hidden racism in the columnist, who comes off sounding more like a male cheerleader?Now that the seeds have been planted, spread among the young that return from ‚Äúcollege‚Äù to small, rural communities, all it takes is to plant ONE agitator and the spread of the virus is easily implemented. They bring their ‚Äúvictim voice‚Äù, along with their righteousness. But they are really there to smear the townsfolk, and force the allocation of re$sources to the side represented so ably by the professional agitator.The concept of ‚Äúdivorce‚Äù certainly has to deal with these tactics or there will be no chance of peace.

            The article says there were 500 protestors in Saranac Lake, which has a population of 5400.

That‚Äôs horrific.

Her comment that upstate NY has the most Confederate flags she‚Äôs ever seen is BS.

There are some, but this is no Mobile, AL or Biloxi, MS.

                As a professional agitator, she is good at lying. Claims someone put some grafitti aimed at her in the town. As anyone that can pronounce Smo-lett knows, this is 100% a hoax and she is a hoaxer.I have been through that town and never, ever saw a ‚Äúconfederate flag‚Äù. Not that I would get my FEELZ all butthurt by it and become an instant victim, but no. Not one.I was not there to count heads, nor do I know how many came in from out of town. As this is a realm filled with deceit, hard to pick fact from fiction and usually best to start with ALL lies, then work from there. Small, financially challenged Upstate NY towns have been colonized in recent years by the Rainbow Flag organization, to this Op, run by the Alinskyite woman is an obvious next step.

                    Giving a shit about ‚Äúconfederate flags‚Äù is just swallowing the narrative of lefty.
You can pencil in ‚ÄúGadsen Flag‚Äù, ‚ÄúBetsy Ross Flag‚Äù, ‚ÄúHawaiian shirts‚Äù. Then we can all hold hands and declare that our Hawaiian shirts are not racist!
I have spent plenty of time in the North Country, Southern Tier, not to mention Cuba, the cheese town and cannot say I have seen any ‚Äúconfederate flags‚Äù let alone this claim that they are ‚Äòcommon‚Äô.
So calling bullshit right here.

He‚Äôs running for President of the USA, not Honkeytopia. Remember that before you work too hard trashing the folks who lean in the DR direction and could be persuaded to cross over, but not by pounding on the one guy big in national politics who at least pretends to give a rip about them.

        all the insanity is a result ‚Äì IMO ‚Äì of the PRC hitting the panic button (and sending all their assets careening across the board).   it looks like insanity to us, but the prc doesn‚Äôt care if all the assets are burned, if it gets Trump out of office.

            The PRC has a Fifth Column of lobbyists, elected or otherwise, in the United States. Some of these people are in many ways more powerful than the PRC itself, and they decided to consolidate power after the peasants started to act up. The anti-White race riots they started, though, may have spiraled beyond their control.

What Antifa Is, What It Isn‚Äôt, and Why It Matters ByMichael KenneyandColin Clarke
Quote:
What Is Antifa?‚ÄúContrary to how it is often portrayed in the media, Antifa ‚Äî short for anti-fascist ‚Äî is not a single organization. Rather, it is a loose network of groups and individuals who coordinate their anti-racist activism on anad hocbasis in different areas both within and outside the United States.‚Äù

            I think you hit the naoil on the head on that one Karl. It‚Äôs clear theat the CCP is riding the tiger there . if they have any real slowdown in growth there will face a Hong kong style revlt from their own 1.4 bill people. they are facing famine from floods and mismanagement of grain storage. they are really on a tightrope.this is a good channel for PRC news that is more open than most. it is also blessedly short and no fluff pieces. you may like it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGGeNVuEY_8
