            I look forward to that podcast. Christian Zionism is a pestilence upon the United States, say no more than Mike Huckabee as ambassador to Israel.Then the traditional mainline churches counter Zionism with rainbow flags and female ministers.It’s tough being a christian now days.

                On the other hand, it is a good example of how bad theology has bad real world implications. The thought is the father to the deed.

                    I’ve got a serious question here; I’m not trying to muddy the waters; I’m honestly curious.We know that the s0d0mites have controlled the RC monasteries for decades now [and arguably for upwards of a millennium or more], but I never hear anything about the question of bulldykery in the RC nunneries.It strikes me that maybe 2 or 3 out of 1000 White females in the 21st Century might walk away from Cluster B and instead embrace the cloistered lifestyle of the nunnery.And it could be more like 2 or 3 out of 1,000,000.Obviously the priests are flagrantly messing around with one another, but I got to wondering what it’s like for the nuns.A couple of decades ago, there was an English pornographer, named Peter Acworth, who purchased the old “Armory” building in San Francisco, and turned it into a BDSM torture palace, for filming BDSM pr0n.And I wonder whether Bulldyke BDSM might be the sole drawing point for new recruitment into the RC nunneries.It’s very very difficult for me to imagine the average 21st Century THOT walking away from the allure of Cluster B, and instead choosing the cloistered lifestyle [sans Cluster B].Cluster B has a d@mned near omnipotent power over the 21st Century USA THOT, and it seems like BDSM would be about all that the nunneries could offer as an enticement to a 21st Century recruit.At this point, I wouldn’t be surprised if many of the old abandoned RC nunneries were already becoming literal BDSM filming studios for Bulldyke pr0n.PS: I am not trying to denigrate any loyal servants of the RC Church, I’m just trying to imagine the 21st Century personality types  [especially amongst the younger females] which would agree to living a cloistered life in the complete absence of Cluster B.My instincts are telling me that only vanishingly small numbers of 21st Century THOTs would agree to it.In fact, I would place my bet on “completely statistically insignificant, much lower than background noise”.

                            If the s0d0mites in the monasteries are fisting one another on a regular basis, then would it not stand to reason that the bulldykes in the nunneries would also be fisting one anotheron a regular basis?I hate to be so dadgum almost nihilistically cynical about this stuff, but knowing what I know about Cluster B, it’s very very difficult for me to imagine hardly any moderin women whomsoever voluntarily walking away from the Cluster B Pandemic and choosing instead a classical [i.e. utterly asexual] lifestyle in a nunnery.My gut instinct is that, at this point, Modernity [particularly in the guise of Cluster B] would likely be obliterating the nunneries.The Los Angeles Times wrote a Lesbian-Nuns piece, back in 1985:https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-05-01-vw-11784-story.htmlThe following year, in 1986, somebody named, “Judith Brown”, wrote another book about Lesbian Nuns:https://daily.jstor.org/lesbianism-at-the-convent/

                        I was once at a baptism, sat through the service beforehand. I almost burst out in laughter whenever I heard the falsetto-voiced closet case priest speak.Then when my parents sold their house 30 years ago, they sold it to who they believed to be were two sisters. Unbeknownst to my parents, the two sisters also brought along their defrocked pedo priest brother to live with them.Oh and there was this story about a Greek Orthodox congregation in Mansfield, Ohio. I guess they hired a former Catholic priest who was also a pedo. What were they thinking? (In his defense, I think he did like girls.)The Catholics have a huge problem with this. They are not only an abomination, but have also become a laughing stock.

            Funny thing is, folks decry how pozzed religious orgs have become, but it has been the traditionalist/right-est denominations that held out the longest.  Much longer than govt, academia, corporations, etc.  Funny that they are now capitulating to the PWC just as their most rock-ribbed parishioners are turning hard(er) right.  RW prots will come out OK, forming new orgs out of the ashes. LW prots will die out.  RCath may keep on zombie-walking.

                Pretty narrow view Mr. Rooster. Our Trad Cath community continues to grow because it rejects being forced to conform with trends. Some things are universal.You may disagree with our apologetics, but it’s difficult to ignore our long view of healthy, homogeneous societies not smitten with the latest fashion.

                    I have experience with RC organizations, to include current day.  To include some trad-caths.  I will stand by my evaluation.  The most lively portions are those trad-cath bits.  They will more or less split or be expelled, draining what little life is left.  I wish it were otherwise, but that is how see it playing out.

                        Serious question here; we know the monasteries are 100% s0d0mite, and have been for decades now, but are the nunneries also 100% bulldyke?It’s a serious question; I’m not trying to start a fight with anyone.I’m just trying to imagine grown women in the 21st Century living a completely cloistered lifestyle, with no Cluster B adulteration of their personalitieswhatsoever.I can’t imagine that there are more than vanishingly small percentages of 21st Century wahmen who would  willingly sign up for a life in the absence of Cluster B.I would guess maybe 2 or 3 out of 100021st Century wahmen might consider the possibility of life-long cloistered-ness.It seems like cloistered bulldykery would be about the only lure which the nunneries could cast into the recruitment pool.About 20 years ago, an English pornographer, named, Peter Acworth, purchased a San Francisco building, called “The Armory”, and turned it into a BDSM torture chamber for pr0n film-making.I’m worried that that sort of thing will be the future of the RC nunneries [if the BDSM crowd hasn’tcompletely overtaken the RC nunneriesalready].

            As far as Catholicism goes just attend a few on a irregular basis and you will get a pretty good idea of where we are at. Sponsoring a family member for Confirmation and did a six hour retreat. Statistics show none or few will return after ceremony. Average age is thirteen which means their parents don’t go now.

                What a shame. Much of that can be blamed on the Antipope Bergoglio, who has desecrated altars withgraven idols such as Pachamamaand his gravely erroneous statements on the faith. Pope Benedict didn’t properly resign and without a resignation or death of a pontiff, you can’t have a legitimate conclave.The odd thing is the antichurch and the real church exist in the same liturgical space.It’s up to the laity, not the bishops or priests, to let the hierarchy know that going against scripture and canon law being changed on a whim to conform to the “modern” day culture of grievous sin and evil is not acceptable.I’m also very angry that Catholic charities and the bishops have used the church as a racket to fill the country with culturally incompatible central Americans and other third worlders. Funny how when USAID got waxed, that went by the wayside.God created nations and as in the story of the Tower of Babel, the Lord didn’t want us all mixed together in an unhappy conglomeration of a country.Refugees are supposed to be temporary residents and actually fleeing tyranny, not journeying north to feed like parasites on the decaying husk of this once-great nation.

Yep. He’s a nationalist.  A Christian Nationalist! so no wonder the Regime hates Him and his.
The Tower of Babel on the Shinar Plains was a hi-tech contraption that got rapidly decommissioned . . . so now it’s Musk and Thiel contacting the stars, round ‘n around, nothing new under the sun.

            State of Christian churches in the U.S. is no mystery.  Although it is a Mystery.  :O)Largely gone the way of surrounding culture, because that’s how most folks do, in every age.  Women and ducats running the show.  Meaning homos good, Diversity good, guitars and bands, no hair coverings, no modest dress, charismatic and personality-cult preechers etc.  More like going to the fair, really.  Speaking of Carneys and Marks.As far as spiritual entities overshadowing the nation, that’d be the ‘female adversary’ or ‘female rival wife’ [Strong’s Hebrew 6869] cited in the first passage of Daniel 12 and commonly called the tribulation.  Can’t know what to do unless you first know your enemy.In every age there’s always a remnant, and there’s a remnant at this hour also.  There are scattered ‘prot’ churches that remain essentially faithful, cleaving to Scripture and not going afield after modernity. There is a hidden church extant also, of course.

                It’s feminized, what I call “happy-clappy-rock-band-Jesus church” that has neither the Gospel or any redemption. It’s just a useless multi-purpose center with no Eucharist and ridiculous “praise” music that is trite and silly.And the preaching. Oh, Jesus is love. No condemnation of sin. Just love and acceptance and all that. And oh, by the way, don’t dare be a racist. And love the 30-member family of Indians who worship 30 “deities” or the Musloids with their burkas as your neighbors. Love the disgusting sodomite or the weirdo dude wearing a dress because of Jesus. Never mind that Jesus would’ve made himself another cord and would be overturning tables at this “church.” Talk about a synagogue of Satan.And don’t forget the Schofield “bible” that requires these people to love Israel, even to the point of sending their kids to die for those folks who oppress Christianity in the Holy Land and use our money and bombs to obliterate Christian Palestinians.Christian Zionists are the absolute worst. St. Paul in his letter to Galatians, Chapter 3, Versus 29:And if you be Christ’s, then are you the seed of Abraham, heirs according to the promise.Yet the Jews are still God’s “chosen” people? I guess that whole new covenant established by the death and resurrection of Jesus in Scripture didn’t mean anything to them. Which makes them non-Christian. That’s a key belief that can’t be wished away because some lunatic said the Jews returning to “their” land was a sign of Jesus’ return.

        The real problem for Trump’s proposed reforms may be that they are simply be too little, too late. A border wall would have fixed immigration in the 1980s. It’s mostly irrelevant in a country with a majority foreign school-age population. Tax cuts, which were good for the economy in the Kennedy era, merely worsen the fiscal overhang we have now. Deciding China is our primary adversary could have been viable in the 1990s. Launching a trade war against them after we’ve shipped all our manufacturing over there is just plain dumb. Increased defense spending was at worst superfluous in theReagan years, but it represents the height of recklessness following the Ukraine debacle. An administration incapable of ending that conflict due to a misunderstanding of the realities on the ground, will be hard pressed to design a workable industrial policy for a Brazilian population relying on Argentinian finances.

                    Paradoxically, Pinochet did little to inoculate his country from the wokeness of its current politics. But then healso shut down the antisemitic press in Chile, so there’s that, as well.

                “Well said. Agree x 1000. It’s way too late to ‘fix’ the system.”Period! All of the above, AND: “We are evolved to be group-oriented, but Darwinian selection pressures have collapsed since the Industrial Revolution, and so a significant component of the Woke are high in mutational load. This is congruent with Woke being, on average, both mentally and physically unhealthy, and they display various specific markers of mutation. “ –Ed DuttonThis applies to much greater numbers than just the Woke. Women are at war with their own bodies. Tons of people are so mentally ill they believe they are fluffy bunnies and unicorns, yet dangerous, sexually ambiguous, flaying, covered with fishing tackle, screaming loud colors and massive tribal tats.Add in the Wall-E World folks.Glad they make it easy to recognize them. Cross the street, pay attention and get away. Mental instability is increasing. Personally, I eschew and keep my distance from most folks as their mutational overload and mental instability drips and corrodes.

            Right you are with everything you stated, so when they state they’re doing something for x reason, well you have to read between the lines.  Ford and GM stopped manufacturing cars in the US a bit less then a decade ago.  They stated it was due to cars being to expensive and not making enough profit, that could be partially true, but i think it has to do more with giving more market share to our asian allies and european friends.  That is why you see joe bob and every other chud driving a Mercedes these days.  If information is power, why would they ever tell you the truth and give you the same info they “trade” on?

            Trump giving tariff relief on the IT sector tells you how badly our manufacturing base has been gutted.
Like the realization about Pharmaceuticals and microchips, I think last week – and the response to it – will serve as a wake up call.  Repatriating drug making and chip making is a bipartisan effort.  When the car manufacturers almost collapsed in 2023 due to chip shortages, many things started to change.

        Interesting economic analysis as always.  Don’t have much more to comment.  So, hey, totally off topic, but – I wonder if anyone else was annoyed by the interracial romance in the Alien Romulus movie (he was a robot and her programmed “brother” but it was basically a romance). It one more movie where a self-disciplined competent black man makes sacrifices for the greater community, acts for the common good, places their honor above their comfort or desires (or even survival), and is in general the noble protector of white community and specifically white women, while white men are self-indulgent childish conniving cowards and evil-doers.Two other examples that immediately come to mind are Finn with Rey in Star Wars, Lieutenant Mattias in service of Elsa and Anna in Frozen 2, and GI Joe Rise of Cobra, where Ripcord gets Scarlett by taking on a suicidal mission to save humanity from nuclear destruction. It’s another modern trope like how most STEM geniuses in movies and TV shows for the past thirty years have had to be black, or how TV commercials in the last ten years have constantly shown White men as bumbling pathetic idiots getting schooled by contemptuous, annoyed blacks and women.

            Also, I forget the name, but there was some stupid horror movie a while back where a white couple went on vacation to some amusement park. The park turned out to be evil, and characters started being killed. It gets revealed that the white boyfriend/husband guy was the evil mastermind behind it all. When there were only two survivors left from the victims, the black guy heroically defended the white lady from her now ex, bravely and nobly almost dying the process. Then, at the end, after killing the white guy, the white girl sweetly falls in love with black guy. Like, could they have made it any more obvious. Many such cases!

                Every TV show and movie tries to randomly insert interracial relationships and it almost always is one particular composition. I also noticed that shows on the streaming services generally don’t introduce this type of stuff until the 2nd, 3rd, 4th show – almost like they are trying to get you hooked then they drop the propaganda. It’s actually gotten more ham-fisted and clumsy as time goes on, I watched a show on Netflix that had a black character in it that had NO place in the story and disappeared immediately after he got with the white girl, almost like the people working on the show had a mandate to insert this into the show but had no idea how to place it.

                    Agreed.My liberal ex was so uncomfortable by all the annoyed comments I made as we watched Ted Lasso season 2 and Zoe’s Extraordinary Playlist about the interracial love affairs being pushed that she didn’t want to watch them with me any more.I think I would be more OK with interracial relationships in movies and TVs if, after the initial romance and sexual excitement fades, the black guy lies to the white woman with complete conviction, runs up her credit card and drains her bank account, uses her car at times she needed it, gets her into a destructive drug habit, gives her an STD, runs around with other women behind her back, and/or flies off the handle and hits her, especially if she confronts him about the cheating or tries to break up with him. And then she breaks up with him, decides the whole thing had been a dumb mistake, says “Oh THAT’S why my Republican dad was so against this”, vows never to date a black guy again, and warns her girlfriends against it too. Like – at least make it realistic.

                        I have told my lady about TGR, white cultural genocide and white genocide. It helped her figure out why I would get so upset or just turn abruptly turn off a TV series. The latter went on for a while. The final straw was season 2 of Netflix Barbarien. It is the story of Arminius. In episode 2 they introduced a black female whose first scene, aside from being a negress east of the Rhine in ~50 AD, was girl boss explaining the Germanic heroic character exiled and giving up his love to support Arminius and the cause of his people. She was now his love interest. I apologized, turned it off and just explained to her that I refuse to watch the cultural genocide of my people. I asked her if it would be okay if Negros were portrayed playing King David, King Solomon, or Moses. Or, if it was okay if in China Chinese Emporers were portrayed as White or as Negros.She understood. Putting things in these terms helps people understand. It helps because the morality is that non-whites must be protected and elevated and their culture venerated at all times. When you point out that it is not only fair game but celebrated that ethnic Europeans and only ethnic Europeans are subjected to this, they intuitively understand that it is not only a humiliation, but a sinister and malevolent undertaking.I did acquiesce to watching White Lotus. This last season ends with all the White guys going on murderous rampages and the Browns inheriting and/or extorting money from the Whites. In the negro mother, son pairing, the college educated son exhorts the mother to ask the murderous White man not for 100K but for 5 million. They get it. The penultimate scene is them giving teeth grinning smiles as they boat away from the resort. The final scene is the extorted White man, smiling as his smoking hot young wife asks a brown guy at the pool to bang her in front of him as he loves being cuckholded. The only White man who is redeemed is a bi-sexual drug addict who checks himself into a Buddhist monestary to be lectured and rehabilitated by the Zen monks – while the non-whites cuck the white men and celebrate materialism and plunder riding off with their money.The message is clear. I am sure Wyatt Stagg would or will have a field day with that one.I didn’t say anything. I won’t be watching it again. I suggest all of us turn it off and if we permit our youth to watch these, to use their instinct for rebellion against the system and turn them on to people like Wyatt Stagg for some hard hitting red pills.

                    The interesting aspect of Netflix to me is that they buy a lot of media from foreign nations, particularly Asian.  The “poz” is world-wide!.  No, you won’t see a Black man often in a Korean TV series or movie, but you will see effeminate men with makeup, women who kick the crap out of male opponents, and of course normalized homosexuality.

                        You sometimes do see blacks in Netflix Korean dramas . . . it is very strange when they do show up and their role is to say a few words and highlight Korean “racism” against blacks.After that, they promptly disappear.Mostly the shows have all Asian casts, making them far better than the typical diverse Netflix show if only because they seem natural.A Korean show has a Korean cast, duh.In all but one case that I know of, overt Homos are a no go in K dramas, though yes Korean dudes are into skin care in ways Americans find (or used to find) light in the loafers.Several shows are excellent in terms of character development and story lines . . . But the feminist POZ often can be very strong.After watching a few, you understand something about what appeals to Korean woman as well as why the Koreans can barely get together and don’t have kids.

                        Relatedly, one of my favorite Mexican restaurants has several TV screens that are always tuned in to some Mexican sports channel. Naturally, soccer is always on. Anyhow, it’s amusing to note that even in corporate advertising targeting actual Mexicans, there is a wealth of nuggras in the ads. AINO’s Power Structure demands that not only whites but also Mexicans worship and adore the sainted savants from the Dark Continent.

                        Because the American Woman rules, and she does not approve of her males going foreign to get the sensible, faithful and loving wives and girlfriends that (feminist) American females cannot be.  Or refuse to be, whatever.
That tactic executes an effective end-run around collective female power and control in the U.S.
Men don’t want a competitor or a supervisor or a ‘partner’, they want a wife.  Don’t have ’em at home?  Gotta look elsewhere.

                            that makes sense.  white women don’t like the idea that other women out-women them in some ways.  Probably why white man/asian woman pairings are not depicted.  And if they are discussed, it’s in terms of the creepy white guys yellow fever and wanting a “weak” woman for oppressive colonial mindset perversions and whatnot.

                        White men must be kept demoralized and prevented from thinking they can find a woman who isn’t a fat, tatted up hyper-slut with blue hair. White women can’t be shamed out of being gross, trashy whores who look like they just walked out of a Ricky Lake** show audience. Our media worked hard to get White culture down to the circus freakshow level it’s at. They’re not going to let a bunch of petite slant-eyes drag White guys out of the gay bars and divorce courts.** Yeah Ricky Lake is a dated reference. Forgive me for not keeping up on trailer park culture memes. I have no idea who’s doing that shtick nowadays.

                    I watch little video, but read UK news. One amusing/annoying video I did catch was something set in (say) 19th century London, everybody in period costume. In one scene is seen a well-dressed Negro gentleman, complete with top hat. No, this wasn’t Monty Python, but it might as well have been. If UK’s society is as screwed up as the admittedly right-leaning press I read makes it out to be, it makes America’s society positively look like the 1950s in comparison.

                What you say makes sense. And, I have a perception that the disproportionately Jewish folks in Hollywood in charge of stories, dialog, plot, characters, and casting have gotten increasingly worse at their jobs as the decades go on, while the disproportionately gentile technical folks in charge of special effects, CGI, historically accurate backgrounds and props, etc have gotten better and better at what they do. I watch many movies to see what the latter group have created. Alien Romulus had some strikingly beautiful scenes, like for example (minor spoiler) the wow at the end when the space station disintegrated in the planet’s rings. I enjoyed Avatar for the CGI visuals of landscapes, strange creatures, futuristic interiors, and the flying around battle scenes, not for the naive anti-civilization political message.

                        Sounds like a good place to employ “malicious compliance”. Cast 13% blacks as criminals, 15% (or whatever) latinos as hired help in the homes of rich Joos, some % Asians as computer nerds… Actually, you could just do a story about a smart young White guy who likes computers as he stumbles around trying to get a job and endlessly faces hiring committees made up of AWFL HR bitches who keep asking him “Please tell us what diversity means to you”. Eventually, he gets frustrated and just starts selling meth – sort of a fresh take on Breaking Bad.I know, no one in that industry would dare. Except they’d make a fortune doing a realistic movie or series. I’m sure some of the people in Hollyweird are cynical enough to find this frustrating – dammit, we need to make another pozzed-out show with heroic blacks and wammen martial arts masters!

                        Thanks. It was worth the read for learning a new acronym, “AAFS,” and it was heartening that he mentioned anti-White discrimination has been policy since at least the Seventies, and black crime an issue forever.

            Methinks they doth protest too much.At any rate, since Trump’s miraculous return to the White House, the cultural negrophilia has only worsened. It is to the point now that almost literally every single person one sees in any cultural format is an African savage. And it’s not just at the corporate level. This sickness is now taking hold at the local level as well.When will the collective gorge rise from this glut of negroid imagery and provoke a recoil? I know, I know–not until bellies begin rumbling and the lightbulbs begin flickering and dimming. But I swan to goodness, white people’s lack of pride and judgmentalism is downright contemptable. We shouldn’t have to wait for hunger and intermittent utilities before we lash out at the Black Tide.

                There are glimmers of hope.  Movies being remade or sequels specifically to cast to be “inclusive” or make such a point too blatantly have failed spectacularly.  Comes to mind:  Snow White, Star Wars sequels, Ghost Busters (all female cast).
To me, this shows there really isn’t a large enough “die hard” audience for DIE in entertainment, but rather an all too complacent White audience that puts up with such in small amounts.
We here are more sensitive to these things and assume every one else is, or should be.

            A good rule of thumb is if you see a black person on the TV, change the channel.  If you see one in a magazine, turn the page.  If you see one on a catalogue, throw it out.  You won’t be missing anything.  I tried a mini-series on Moby Dick.  The first scene starts with Pip being beaten by his white master…That was all it took for me to change the channel.

With the exception of McClain, all the bad and contemptible characters were white, and the terrorist organization itself seemed to be an offshoot of the Nazis, dontchaknow. Too bad because it’s a good flick.

            That might have been what Trump was getting at, but given his ham-handed way of expressing himself, I doubt it. Anyone who took Buffett’s advice and had a cash position had an opportunity to buy the dip. Looking at the numbers, I don’t think the bond jitters were about unseating Trump. They were just people who figured they would have a little more notice before the equity markets gave them a dip to buy into, so weren’t sitting on liquid cash, but were sitting on bonds, which were basically flat.Give it a couple months and we’ll know better whether it was an attempt to control, or just an attempt to get in while the getting’s good.

        Yes, it IS too late to fix it.When I taught American Politics, I used to devote a week or so per semester to macroeconomics, government debt, budgeting, etc. Years ago I concluded that it was impossible to actually make sense out of it.Keneysianism ruled from the 1930s to the 1970s, but by the 1980s deficits had become chronic whether the business cycle was in recession or growth, so monetarism became dominant while the deficits continued to balloon.From 1961 to the present there have only been six years when the government has not run a deficit. The national debt spiraled from 3 trillion in 1990 to $36 trillion today. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones went from 3,000 to 45,000.We are now at a point where no palliative measures can be taken without wrecking the entire stack of dominoes. Government debt is such a big part of GDP that if it is curtailed it will cause recession, and the recession cannot be counteracted by deficit spending as Keneysianism requires.If monetarists try to control inflation by raising interest rates, that will not only cause a recession, it will curtail government spending because government cannot continue to borrow $2 trillion a year unless rates are near zero. Continued borrowing will undermine the credibility of the government in the eyes of investors, who will shy away from Treasuries, causing rates to rise.Supply-side tax cuts can  no longer be used as a stimulus with a $36 trillion debt that needs to be paid.The only way out is or inflate the debt away by debasing the currency, which will lower American standards of living appreciably by causing inflation. Expect some sort of gimmick like Federal reserve crypto to replace the dollar, seizure of 401(k)s, and a general increase in penury and a lower standard of living, coupled with military pullback from imperial obligations.

            Because the dollar is the global reserve currency, the US has to run trade deficits and a budget deficit, both of which eventually weaken the US to the point that whole Eurodollar system will collapse.
The Eurodollar system is inherently contradictory and guaranteed to fail – spectacularly. But, for now, there’s nothing to replace it with. That’s where we find ourselves. Quite the mess.

                    Trump has signaled that the US won’t continue to be the consumer of last resort. The RoW has to increase their domestic consumption to reduce exports to the US and increase imports from the US. The RoW needs to stimulate in a major way.
More domestic consumption (tax cuts, infrastructure spending, etc.) in other countries and a weaker dollar. Of course, that means lots of borrowing, which normally would increase interest rates, but govts can’t afford those higher rates, so central banks step in to provide funding.
Inflation ensues. Too bad. It melts away the debt and balances trade.

                        The turbulence will continue from the ensuing dollar crunch amongst foreign banks, as the Euro is having real problems of its own. Those guys’ hair is always on fire anyways.
Again, the Great Taking is designed for sudden collapse in both the Euro and the dollar, necessitating a Reset, that is, a “recollateralizion” using private assets (a bail in, a confiscation); that’s what the Euro was really designed for, not to smooth Schengen Zone trade like they said. Thus the continued insistence of the EU on Ukraine failure policy and Net Zero scams. Supposed to hit by 2029.

                    I also think that the hyper-looting phase that took place after the Revolution of 2020 was deeply disconcerting to anyone sane. Anyone with eyes saw the US had degenerated into a seething cauldron of racial resentment, hatred and rivalry. Moreover, the ruling regime was using it to attack its core population and take it to its demise.I think Covid was merely a cover for handling a massive bond market dislocation when huge amounts of treasury and private debt needed turnover but had no buyer. At the same time, the anti-reformers Z discusses saw the opportunity to bury Trump and the Historic American Nation with him. They went into hyper mass population replacement and mass looting at the same time.Putin likely saw this not only as his last chance to protect Moscow from a Ukraine armed and pointed at it with NATO at its helm, but a moment of chaos and depravity he could exploit to set up a borderland and buffer zone. The US sanction regime failed. The Regime probably gave up and Blinken, a literal son of Wall St., went about playing in bar bands singing subversive, anti-America folk songs in dingy Ukrainian bars as a sort of late Sanhedrin Bob Dylan revival tour. It was quite the nose dive.At least Trump and his oligarchs arrested it. Use the respite to calibrate your position and do some bolstering. I think Morgoth is right. The act of reform will, like Gorbachev’s Parastroika, will collapse the system as it cannot be reformed.

                        Much of this is chicken and the egg. Does corruption cause a state to become thuggish and dictatorial, or does a thuggish and dictatorial state lead to corruption? When systems collapse there are tells along the way, some seemingly unrelated to the outcome but inevitably a key part of it. Corruption certainly is present, but whether it was a cause or effect depends on interpretation.As an example of the consequences of corruption, after the seizure of Russian assets, foreign investors are faced with a Hobbesian choice: continue to play in what amounts to the only game in town or take the hit early and not risk outright theft?  And the little tells are the ones that add up. If the FBI can be sent to investigate profit taking by small investors, which happened with Gamestop interrupting a well-planned short, does reputed transparency even matter?I don’t know where things are on the timeline, but the accelerated looting indicates some think it is further along than is apparent.

                My understanding of the eurodollar is that it is the engine oil that lubricates the global trade engine.That’s the main product we sell, and why our “debt” could expand from $1 trillion in 1980 to $36 trillion today with no crash- the amount of oil used simply depends on the size of the engine.What made it dicey this week is China’s rollout of the digital RMB for trade settlement with 10 ASEAN nations and six Mideast nations. SWIFT takes 3 days and 6 bank clearinghouses to settle, the blockchain RMB is purported to take sevenseconds,with a 97% reduction in handling fees. I can foresee regional “settlement blocs.”Thus, the impending attack on Iran. We always attack nations that propose alternative banking; China and Taiwan are both too big to attack, but Iran is a major energy supplier to China, protector of Russia’s soft underbelly, and the general provider of Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis. (The shipping routes of the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea are thus affected.) Iran is a key weak link in both the BRICS and Belt.Iran has hundreds of shore batteries pointed at the chokepoint of the Hormuz Strait, while the Houthis point their rocketry at the Bal-el-Mandeb Strait, both are shipping chokepoints.We’ve not yet converted away from the petrodollar to a full “derivatives dollar”, that is, an asset backed dollar based on Lutnick’s nationalized assets as collateral for derivative holders with seniority rights on private securities (they can and will borrow against your assets, in other words.)My new Yemeni storekeeper explained the Houthis to me. There are regular Yemeni, and Houthis; it is very similar to Yankees and Confederates, even stemming from their civil war between their North and South (Their North is actually the geographic east, their South is what is south of the Hejaz, western edge of Saudi Arabia.) The Houthis would be analogous to Appalachian mountain men, as Yemen has hard mountains ringing its coastline.

                “Because the dollar is the global reserve currency”
It’s not that its the reserve currency, but rather that it’s the transaction clearing currency. Reserves don’t change much. Transactions are constant churn. Being the clearing currency means that the US has to run a trade deficit to keep injecting dollars, which they then borrow back at interest to keep the flow going.
That’s the real reason for trade barriers against American goods. To keep Uncle Sucker on the “borrow from the world, put the consequences on Americans, particularly American industries and manufacturers” hamster wheel.

                    Yeah, rest of the world is full of shit when they talk about the dollar being GFC (or clearing currency) giving us the exorbitant privilege. Sure, it has advantages, but the disadvantages eventually destroy your country.
There’s a reason that no other country is lining up to take over the dollar. No one wants to do that to themselves.

            Or we can work harder, save more and piss away less money on welfare and warfare. If we do all this and can grow the economy, we have a decent chance of success. If DOGE taught us anything, it’s that we can cut government spending massively without impacting services. Hegseth just unveiled a $1 Trillion Pentagon budget ffs!

                We can (and will) piss away less on warfare, but not welfare. We are in the same situation as the British in 1945. We no longer have the money for war, but we have a population that both needs and wants social services. Churchill did not hold elections during the war while he indulged his lifelong elite fetish for warfare and imperialism. As soon as elections were called in 1945, the public voted for Attlee, for socialism, and to end imperialism.Social Security and Medicare is the single biggest budgetary expense. When people are forced to choose between running a deficit to give money and weapons to Israel and Ukraine or giving Social Security and Medicare to 70-year old Midwestern whites, they are going to choose the latter.Hitherto those Midwestern whites have been loyal to the ZOG empire because it treated them well — military pensions, VA, disability, etc. When the standard of living drops and they see that the oligarchs are going to pursue Jewish and foreign interests over their own, they will vote for socialism even if brown people like AOC are the ones leading the charge.In the final analysis, Trump is not Hitler, he is Crassus. The Romans of the republican era could not fathom a marginalized Senate, an imperial consul, and internecine wars between the triumvirs that ultimately led to an empire controlled by barbarians, foreigners, and populares politicians concerned primarily with bread and circuses.But a few centuries later, that is exactly what happened.

True, and they are also the single biggest source of revenue. So far as revenue to expense ratio, there has rarely been anything as sweet a gig for the Feds as SS.

            Which monetarists do you think were involved? Chicago School couldn’t get any traction in the US, so they had to take their show on the road to Pinochet. Not even St. Ronnie was a monetarist.
You are absolutely spot on about the deficit. Spending absolutely has to be reined in. It’s not that you can’t get out of debt without inflating. People do that all the time. They have no effective way of inflating their way out of debt, so they live under their means and pay off debt.
It’s rather that you can’t get out of debt by borrowing.

                Paths developing have two options it would seem.  One, endure short term pain for long term gain.  The other the opposite.  People, being well—people, never choose pain and ironically that’s what they will eventually wind up with.

        Why does corruption in government always surprise us? Why do we expect anything else from it? Government is organized force. It takes our wealth and makes war. And we think honest men would do that work?Well, honest men have sincerely tried, but look at the results and ask yourself whether honesty has any inherent tendency to prevail in politics. War, taxation, waste, debt, inflation, hatred, hypocrisy, cynicism, social disorder. And also — amazingly enough! — corruption.As I often say, expecting government to produce good results is like expecting a tiger to pull a plow. After the twentieth century, in which the world’s governments killed hundreds of millions of their own subjects, everyone ought to talk about the state the way Jews talk about Hitler. Yet we still have high hopes for this beast, because, after all, the mighty tiger is certainly strong enough to pull that plow if he wanted to! If only.Joe Sobran

            Sobran cribbed from the best:So Samuel spoke all the words of the Lord to the people who had asked him for a king. And he said, “This will be the practice of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and put them in his chariots for himself and among his horsemen, and they will run before his chariots. He will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and some to do his plowing and to gather in his harvest, and to make his weapons of war and equipment for his chariots. He will also take your daughters and use them as perfumers, cooks, and bakers. He will take the best of your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, and give them to his servants. And he will take a tenth of your seed and your vineyards and give it to his high officials and his servants. He will also take your male servants and your female servants, and your best young men, and your donkeys, and use them for his work. He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his servants. Then you will cry out on that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the Lord will not answer you on that day.”

        Well, we have a $35 trillion national debt and a $2 trillion deficit; if you cut all non-entitlement, non-military spending to zero the government still runs a massive deficit (which is why, in part, DOGE was always smoke and mirrors).  The government also printed $11 trillion during fraudvirus (“COVID”) and gave most of it to the ultra-rich, causing the 30% annual inflation we all suffer from now.  So even radical tariff changes are not going to change this underlying picture.From another angle, though, the tariff stuff has *also* been smoke and mirrors.  Trump has been feeding what he is doing before he does it to his Jewish insiders like Howard Lutnick, who goes out and is making hundreds of millions or billions buying short-dated options, both calls and puts depending on the day.  The market rumors are simply market manipulation, both to the upside and to the downside.  This is extremely nasty stuff.  Here are two examples:https://x.com/drewpavlou/status/1910105304815292818?s=46https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1910084761865085243?s=46We know Trump personally approved this because he approved a tweet about what a great time it was to invest in the market 3 hours before his announcement about tariffs, causing the 9%+ spike in the market, which he thought would give his criminal allies cover from prosecution.Because Trump’s administration gutted the SEC (including closing down crypto enforcement entirely, from which Trumpcoin and Melaniacoin are extremely in-your-face criminal activities, far worse than Hillary’s foundation), nothing will come out of any of this.  The amount of graft is at a level and a scale never seen before in American history.  And we’re only 3 months into the administration!  It will get much worse moving forward.

        A thalassocracy, or empire built on control of the seas, cannot survive without shipyards or another power having more shipyards. Which describes Britain in 1919 and America in 2019. China has more naval ships in any metric besides aircraft carriers.The correct response would be for Congress to create a five, ten, twenty year plan to correct this. Congress as a whole is too corrupt. The Democrats would turn it into an anti-white pogrom. Republicans are too stupid, caught between unfettered capitalism and national security being an innate contradiction.So Trump, or any President, has four years to create change. Which is impossible. What Trump can do is whack the system so hard that the market is permanently bent to his goal.So he needs to alienate Europe and Japan so that THEY leave our military alliances. He needs to create so much uncertainty that the dollar loses value and manufacturing in America makes sense. He needs to create chaos around tariffs so that companies throw up their hands and manufacture in America.Otherwise, all those interested parties can just wait him out. Buckle up.

        Sadly I’m in the ‘too late’ camp.  The idea of reshoring would have been great in the dim past, but now I have a hard time seeing how the US can take up the slack.  I work in manufacturing, with experience across the automotive, medical device, packaging, and consumer electronics industries.  The common factor among them – the availability of workers with an IQ over 85 and a generally positive attitude toward showing up to grind out finished goods is very, very thin below the age of 50.This is easily understood – whether pay is high or low, working in the production of real goods is Low-Status.  Scenario:  Two guys competing for attention from young lady.  1st guy:  I’m a lawyer making 50k a year with limited chance at partner but I have a nice office uptown.  2nd guy:  I’m a production manager or engineer making 100k in the packaging plant in the ‘hood.  Odds are, poor lawyer has the advantage.   Of course, then comes the third guy – he’s making more than either of the first two as some kind of degenerate profiting from crime – and she walks out of the joint with that douch.Side note – with family life being the biggest/worst gamble you can engage in, why save this femocracy?Before the usual “AI and Robots” thing comes up, it’ll take a while for those to really deliver new wonders in a production environment.  The easy stuff was already automated years ago.  Replacing what human labor is left will require very flexible systems, which will be capital intensive.   It won’t be anything like flipping a switch.

        100%The system has to change, but a lot of people and countries like the system as it is and are going to push back. Even if everyone was on board, upending the old system and replacing it with something was going to cause a huge amount of chaos.Trump and Bessent are attempting the biggest change in the global trade and finance system since Bretton Woods, except they don’t have the power, control and cooperation that the US had after WWII. It’s a monumental task, one that absolutely needs the help of fed chairman. But Powell won’t play ball. He has to get on board or leave. No way around that.

            Case in point: Fed members, obviously at the direction of Powell, immediately put out the word that the inflationary effects of the tariffs probably would chill expected rate cuts. Yes, the tariffs would be inflationary, but the point and timing of that announcement was to bring as much pain as possible as quickly as possible to reverse the policy. It seems to have worked, too. The system cannot be reformed.

                Powell wants to be Volcker. He wants to be the guy who tamed inflation. But what if inflation is what the system needs?
Bessent needs Powell to provide liquidity when needed and, frankly, to keep bond yields down via soft form of yield curve control. That means inflation. Powell is refusing to play ball, which is preventing Trump and Bessent from implementing their plan. Something has to give.

                        It is not known and there is not statutory authority. The answer probably is “no.” The vaunted political insulation of the Fed depends on that answer, too. If anyone ever wonders why the much threatened, never acted upon audit of the Fed is viewed as such a threat, that is because it is the only clearcut political action that can be taken against it.

            Exactly correct.  The key is to temporarily flood the zone with monetary easing to eliminate the short-term volatility of the reforms.  Powell is either in way over his head, or is actively undermining the reforms.

                Powell if terrified to be remembered as Arthur Burns. He wants to be Volcker, the inflation killer. But Bessent needs liquidity and, probably, some form of yield curve control, i.e., money into the system which, naturally, is inflationary.
So, yeah, Powell is undermining the reforms because he thinks that he’s protecting his legacy. Trump and Bessent need him to play ball, but I don’t think that he will. Not sure how this ends.

                    Whether it is to burnish Powell’s legacy or otherwise (I think the point is to maintain the current system), this is exactly right. And the uncertainty about how it ends makes things extremely volatile.

                    Much as one might like to believe that, can you name any time, in any country, where that has worked?
Do you really believe that, for example, you will be able to buy a K-Car for 5 grand? Once Americans get used to paying $50k for the $40k imports, we are never seeing $40k again. Just like we are never again seeing $500 5-year old used cars for kids.

            China ran a $1 Trillion trade surplus with the world last year. The Yuan is fixed (within a tight band) to the Dollar. This is obviously unsustainable. But an entire generation of US capitalists, bankers, traders and Chinese Elites is deeply wedded to the perpetuation of this system. Breaking it is a generational process and beyond the power of one President. Trump would be better off focusing all his energy on DOGE. If we got gov’t spending under control, we could position ourselves to tackle this monumental change.

                    A recent DOGE anecdote.  We have a friend who *has* a 104 yo mother on SSI.  The mother received a notification for “proof of life” by DOGE (SSI).I kid you not!  The notice was for her (104 yo) to send them a “photo” recently taken of herself holding a newspaper with the current date and headline visible!  You can’t make this shit up.  In reads like a movie I saw a while ago, Russel Crowe in “Proof of Life”.Anyway, the entire family got together and with great gram seated in the middle holding the newspaper—all smiling.  The family photo was sent to all friends.

        I am not in favor of Trump’s blunderbuss approach here and I am not totally surprised it failed. But, the fact that he cucked on tariffs proves that the reform the system needs is impossible. The “broken-ness” is baked into the cake. The entire system is built on it being totally screwed up and the only action that can be done is to double down on it. In hindsight, the last time we had to truly fix it was 2008, if the government let the banks fail and eat the sh*t sandwich they made, then perhaps we could have emerged with a healthier system. But the government did not do that, Obama was elected to make the forever wars and financialization bipartisan, and he did just that.

        Given the Federal Reserve’s composition and its attitudes toward the American public, it is possible they intended to undermine the process.This has happened repeatedly. Case in point: shortly after the tariffs were announced, Powell and Co. made sure the sting would be felt even more by claiming the inflationary effect probably would preclude or chill rate cuts. This happened almost simultaneously with the change in policy. It was obvious why the cold water was thrown onto the expected cuts, and if you go back, this has been a pattern when the Fed has disagreed with any policy. Yes, the tariffs would be inflationary, but Powell wanted to make certain it was painful as possible. He wants the policy reversed, and he got it.Powell is a particularly political chairman, and anyone who buys the line that the Fed is apolitical is a fool. I disagree that he is incompetent, though. What Powell does is carefully calculated to achieve certain ends and benefit certain people. Agreed, though, that the system cannot be reformed, because those who can make it painful will do so in response. Precluding reform makes collapse inevitable. And when you consider something small like Gamestop or major like the seizure of Russian assets, why would anyone trust American markets now? I’ve thought the decline would be a long and slow process, but that has to be reconsidered.

        I may be a bit of simpleton, but I always glaze over at financial talk.  It bores me and I simply don’t understand it and it terrifies me that somehow everything hangs in the balance based on this complex financial system that I cannot begin to comprehend.It’s times like these when I come back to Uncle Ted who implored us that we’ve made society so completely complicated and artificial.  Heck, I even start having sympathy for the old American Indians.  Not because they were “noble savages” because they weren’t.  They were scalping each other long before the white man came ashore.

            The financial system(s) of the USA, UK, etc. and its (their) arcana are much less difficult to understand than what first meets the eye. Here in the USA, it has a scriptural basis in “this Constitution”, which begins with a pernicious lie. A relevant passage is found at I.8.2 where it reads that the Congress shall have the powerTo borrow money on the credit of the United StatesTake that away from the conservatards and other globalists, and suddenly their house will sway and shake alarmingly with every breeze. That day must come given the fact that governments and Big Finance are subsidizing our destruction.So don’t you think everyone could save a lot of time and needless frustration pouring over details by simply admitting that the power to borrow must be abolished and criminalized? And if so, that activism to this end is necessarily better than becoming distracted by and crippled through analysis of the details of the opaque financial system?Other constitutions, too, of the USA have their borrowing provisions which need to be eliminated. The UK has no written con like the USA, a fact which presents special problems for subduing the City of London. Still, neither the USA’s constitutions nor the UK’s unwritten con show any indication of being the law which their apologists make them out to be.Now if so called dissidents offer resistance to abolishing government borrowing, wouldn’t it be clear that they are not dissidents after all? Wouldn’t it be obvious that they are part of the problem and mere malcontents who seek entertainment?

The smartest are Chinese shysters and Indian scammers.  The best of the rest are Mestizos.  The balance are dreck.  America cannot be reformed or rebuilt with such raw material.

China, Russia, hell even Saudi Arabia have led the way.China began the move to Party controlled capitalism with their “To be rich is glorious policy.”  In short, they decided to split the profits with those budding capitalists who rose to prominence under this new policy.  But such had its limits, get too greedy and bend the rules and you got a quick trial and a bullet in the head at the local stadium.Putin’s greatest accomplishment may eventually be a recognition of how he wrestled control of essential national assets from the thieving oligarchs (thanks to a drunken and incompetent Yeltsin). I still remember seeing them in a cage in the courtroom during prosecution.  Billionaires all, but none too rich to be stuck in a cage like the common criminals they were.Saudi’s Crown Price locked his oligarchs in a hotel until they came up with a better split of the loot from oil revenue.How’s that compared to America?  Has any capitalist even been sentenced to prison for their corruption?  Few, if any, I can remember.  A family business can kill tens of thousands of citizens through their promotion of harmful and addictive drugs and at best they settle a class action suit for a small part of their ill-gotten gains. When in reality they should spend the rest of their lives in prison and their wealth confiscated.If we lift the veil of “corporate protection” from the owners and operators of the business and start making them criminally responsible for corrupt actions, we might see better results from our capitalist elite—especially the symbol manipulators who use a pen rather than a gun to rob the people.

                You define such and tell me. I tire of your “games” in commentary. You think you’re clever, but you’re not.There are any number/examples of forms of corruption and criminality that can be cited/noted in our capitalistic system. Most are not pursued where it counts—the people making the decisions for the company.To this effect, I noted one example commonly known and currently in the news, Purdue Pharma’s introduction of OxyContin in 1996.. From ChatGPT:…The Sacklers reached a bankruptcy settlement requiring them to pay about $6 billion to fund addiction treatment and prevention programs — but controversially,the deal granted them personal immunityfrom future opioid-related lawsuits, despite not admitting wrongdoing.As of 2024,the Sacklers remain a highly controversial symbol of corporate greedand the human cost of America’s opioid epidemic. The Supreme Court has been involved in reviewing the legality of the settlement, and the family has largely retreated from public life, although the Purdue bankruptcy plan — with that $6 billion settlement — is moving forward.

                    It’s hardly corrupt to transfer money from one pocket to the other, or to even use deception to achieve some personal gain, so long as you are not using power you legitimately have to transfer something of value from those who entrusted you with that power for a personal (or corporate) gain. An essential element is conversion, that those stakeholders who authorized you were deprived access to that money, good or service.Bribery can be corrupt, but only if the person taking the bribe abuses his authority to deliver on thequopart of thequid pro quo. That’s why corruption is hard to establish in anything other than public sector.The Sacklers were hardly corrupt — it was someone in the FDA who rubber-stamped the non-addictive claim. Someone somewhere in the judiciary who approved the settlement.Enron meets the standard, as does bog standard embezzlement, which usually is prosecuted.And you are smart enough to understand the difference, It gets tiresome when you pretend you are not.

            That may be the Achilles’ Heel of the Anglo-Saxon predilection towards pirates and robber barons combined with relatively weak central authority. When push comes to shove there’s no strong man to rein in the oligarchs as both the system and dominant political culture discourage such person from arising, except for a civil war.
The great irony might come with the demographic descent of USA into a world of ethnicities that could produce such figure (likecaudillofor South Americans). Those joking about the “helicopter rides” should remember that the Providence can be very cruel in fulfilling one’s wishes.

        Reforming the budget is not that difficult.  First, pass a balanced budget amendment.  Second, cut $500 billion from the military, $500 billion through DOGE elimination of fraud, $500 billion through across the board spending cuts, and then raise taxes/tariffs by $500 billion.  The tax increases could only come with a balanced budget amendment, or congress would simply spend the extra money.  This easily balances the budget.  You could negotiate between the four categories, but eliminating the $2 trillion annual deficit would be very easy.  This is what would happen in any company or family.  But the politicians and their financiers do not want it to happen for their own short-term selfish reasons.

                Totally agree.  Our current military budget is larger than the EU, China and Russia combined.  We have over 400 million private firearms, and more hunters than all the world’s standing armies combined.  We are impossible to invade.  Thus, 90% of our military spending is for the benefit of other nations, and the grifters in our political class.

Dilbert guy said the same thing during one (or more) of his videos, but tens of millions of invaders have poured in since the 1960’s. Most of the private firearms must be in the hands of retards, cowards, or collaborators.

                            “How many…did the trillions…stop…?Of course the correct answer is ‘few’. I have no quarrel with an argument that virtually all of the military spending is wasteful or pernicious. Instead, I call attention to the mentality of the typical American gun owner and the wrongness of your narrow application of the word invasion.“That’s…a different type of invasion”How different could it be when the effect(s) is similar?? Invasions are usually about plundering or settling conquered land with one’s own people. It hardly matters if the plunderers (including business people) or settlers invade unarmed while traitors or fifth columnist hold the weapons and protect the invaders from reprisals by people of the invaded land. There’s going to be a similar long term effect. It’s not merely the spilling of blood and guts that the invaded people should want to avoid. They ought to be thinking about preventing plunder, subjugation, and displacement whether guns are fired or not.On this view, the swarming immigrant invasionmustbe regarded more or less as any other invasion, but the American gun nut, being retarded or worse, offers almost no deterrence. It seems not even to occur to him! So it makes little difference to the long term outcome whether he has 400m, 40m, or 4000m firearms. The territory gets invaded and overrun in any case, and the Heritage gun nut is eliminated from the picture. It’s not much of a consolation prize that elimination happens slowly rather than rapidly, as could be the case when repelling an armed invasion by well equipped foes.

                                The State ensures the gun owners can’t organize, and without organization there is no way to fight effectively.  But even if they could organize, mobilizing the militia against migrants would mean fighting both the migrants and the Feds and maybe the US army sent by the State to protect the status quo.  The state wants these invaders.If a foreign state invaded with an actual army, the powers that be would take a very different approach.  Within days you’d have special forces guys helping train those same gun owners how to be insurgents, to protect the regime that hates them.  Our rulers would happily use us as volksturm cannon fodder to protect themselves.

            “Reforming the budget is not that difficult.”
You confuse solution with process/implementation.  Political will is not there. The family is a small hierarchical structure with no alternative except bankruptcy and homelessness in the face of inaction.
Perhaps a better analogy is the family with several credit cards, each one being used to support a lifestyle no longer affordable via earned income.  Each credit card over time being maxed out and the end of such a lifestyle drawing near.  The last credit card in the wallet is reaching its limit.

I would then say “Oh, you mean like the F-35 boondoggle?” or “how are the hypersonic missile programs going?” or “Any developments in air defenses or are we just going to use the 1980’s Patriot systems and 1990’s THAAD systems forever?”  I would then point to Russia’s nationalized defense sector and how they managed to build hypersonic missiles and advanced air defenses that are generations ahead of anything the vaunted privately held MIC has produced.  If the MIC isn’t reigned in, we’re going to be stuck with charlatans like Palmer Luckey selling crappy loitering munition drones for $1 million a pop in perpetuity.

        I say, embrace the fog of chaos, and wear that cloak with serious intent. And when the melee begins, make a difference. There is real joy in tangibly solving a problem.

            This seems to meld with my thinking. In short, we’ve tried everything else (or least what was possible given the politics of the day) and it has not worked, so why not try the “impossible/improbable”. I remember 9/11 and watching those people leap from the upper floors rather than stay put and endure self-immolation. Some say they committed suicide. I say they took a one in a million chance—their only chance.
Such is the situation we are now presented with.

        7/8ths of the budget is effectively off limits, being defense, entitlements or interest on the debt. That’s why I laughed out loud last week when Elon Trumpeted his “150 billion” in cuts (cue Dr. Evil meme). It’s a joke, and everyone sitting around that table had to pretend it wasn’t. That probably wasn’t hard for an ignorant slut like Kristi Noem, but Bessent was no doubt rolling his eyes.Half the country gets a government check, of one sort or another. The other half expects taxes to be only moderately extortionate. There is no squaring that circle in a liberal democracy.Paging Generalissmo Francisco Franco (still dead, unfortunately).

        “This would imply that normalizing the American economy is no longer possible, at least not through standard political processes, because the entrenched interests profiting from the system will not allow it.”Not sure about this. Team Trump could have handled this better, far better. They could have increased tariffs a bit — but not to the ridiculous level they did last week. They could have explained the rationale, and argued that is was part of a larger strategic plan to onshore manufacturing capability and as a consequence reduce unsustainable current account deficits. They did none of this. The only conclusion one can draw is that this “policy” — if indeed one could call it one — was purely punitive in character. Then when the markets, particularly the bond market, started to wobble, Team Trump beat a hasty and undignified retreat. The consequence is that the administration has scored an own goal, shot itself in the foot, and shown its credibility to be close to zero. Even among its hitherto ardent supporters.At the moment the rest of the world wants to have nothing to do with the USA. This realisation might be dawning on Team Trump itself. The USA is no longer the “indispensable nation” — not today and probably not in the future either. It needs the rest of the world more — and more desperately — than the rest of the world needs it. To put it bluntly, it’s becoming a leper.

            Fundamentally, economics, at bottom, is all about confidence. And a whole bunch of it was lost in the last week or two, which most likely cannot be regained (while the same people are in charge). They should have been able to recognize that and forge ahead, rather than back off after the damage had already been done.

Is it?  Or are you describing a con game, a ponzi scheme?  If i need something, say a hammer, and you sell it, i’ll buy it and if it breaks within a week i won’t buy another from you.  Try another vendor with the knowledge to test the handle of the hammer this time since yours broke in a week.  Now if i’m running a scam based on ever higher prices and amounts of debt, then yeah, confidence is paramount.

            I have to disagree.  Trump has a very short window.  Slow reforms always run out of time, and partially completed reforms are quickly reversed by the next president.  Slow is the worst of all worlds.  You get upfront pain, but not enough time for the reforms to work.  Stock market corrections of 20% happen quite frequently.  Trump’s main problem is having a Fed chairman who is either stupid or devious.

                Like@JackDodson says, it needed to be more targeted. There was no chance we were going to be able to onshore electronics manufacturing in his probably 1.5 years left to effect change.
Ideally, he would have focused on making company and capital formation less onerous instead of picking a fight with the world. We really can scale up things like CNC mills to produce even more CNC mills, and we still have enough talented workers to compete. We just can’t do it with all the dead weight losses.

                    I agree it will take a long time to onshore manufacturing, if it can be done at all.  But I don’t agree on being more targeted with the tariffs.  The main target is China.  All the rest is a lot of whining about nothing.

                        That’s what I meant by targeted. Rather than goring everyone’s ox, he could have limited it to China, though I don’t know enough about that to say. It just bothers me that I’m ending up agreeing with neocons and especially Navarro. Any time we are on the same side of anything, I need to go back and check my work.

                An actual diplomacy would’ve been more useful. One case after the other are showing that a PR-stunt foreign policy is severly limited in long-term effectivness and mostly acts as an opiate for the dopamine-starved supporters. The assumption that the USA can impose and lift sanctions/tariffs on a whim, without greater consequences (a major feature of the post-cold war US policy), appears to still captivate the American elite.
A good side effect of this drama might be a push for alternatives to the increasingly unreliable imperial system ofPax Americana.

        I am OK if Powell and a few oligarchs take one for the team _if they won’t get with the team._  Thing is, these wealthy folks will be OK if they get with the new program.  Just diminished in absolute terms, not destroyed, and likely not diminished in relative terms.  They will still be the most wealthy and most influential.Powell + Xnum of oligarchs sacrificed to ward off collapse or ensure a soft landing is a no-brainer.  Get the toxins/auto accidents/”muggings gone bad”/”lost” Epstein video warmed up and ready to do the necessary.This 90 day window I see as Trump &amp; Co working to convince the oligarchs and FIRE folks and deep state wankers to get with the program.  And re-code their trading programs to not all simultaneously jump off a cliff at the first sign of heretofore unfamiliar stimuli.Again, instead of the deep-state+oligarchs+managerial sorts ruling over ashes, I’d rather see them “vigorously retired.”  My sympathy for them has run out a long while back.

        James Carville, a political adviser to President Bill Clinton, famously said in 1994, “I used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or as a .400 baseball hitter. But now I would like to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.”

        It may be ‘too late’ if one takes into accounts the people, instead of the financial data.Just yesterday, on a fairly short auto trip, the most insane, inane and dangerous behavior was in full view. I doubt I even need to describe it … one vignette. I am in left lane, doing about 75 with traffic. Range Rover, dark windows, ‘smoked’ license plate cover comes zooming up my ass. Weaving, flashing headlights, dangerously close. Now there is NOWHERE for me to go … middle lane cars.Eventually Nimrod makes swooping lane change, I slow down to let him get in front of me, cuts me off, chassis of his vehicle tilted. He speeds off to repeat process.I watch this interview with ‘Casey Putsch’ on Tucker C. Now silver spooner, cackler Tucker describes his bonafides over and over, see he is a ‘car guy’. The Beer Hall-monikered, car ytube talker mentioned ‘Dieselgate’ and Tucker stops, “what’s that?”Candy O from the Cars, ahem, the fancy mulatto ytube talker is on this exercise chick’s chow, Jigglian Michaels. Candy mentions something about Saint George, and Jiggler does an ‘Elaine from j0-osih Comedy’ “get out! impression, ‘I was watching the video and thinking ‘get off that poor man” and a similar vapid, out of touch ‘get out” reaction to something blatant in the cultural millieu.Joe Rogan, the smartest man in the culture gave me permission by extension to say, “it’s RETARDS all the way down.”

            Well, at least Tucker can drive a stick, which is more than what 80% of “Americans” can say.  How he hasn’t heard of dieselgate is a mystery..  How dieselgate even happened is a bit of a mystery.  How in god’s name did they think they could get away with it?  But it does put the theory to rest that conspiracies don’t exist because people cannot keep quiet.

        “In fact, the financial system relies on clever quants coding models to exploit these small discrepancies between current and future prices to generate wealth.”
If you are doing a transaction where only a financial instrument is exchanged and you make money, then the other side has lost money. No wealth is generated only exchanged. Equal parts gain for the winner, equal parts loss for the loser. That is why this system will fall.

            Actually, the carry trade can be a benefit to society. If a company or farmer or whoever wants to lock in a price for a good six months from now, you should be paid something for providing that money and taking the risk that the price might fall.
Naturally, Wall Street warps that service, levers it to the moon and makes a negative to society.

            Financial engineering is a lubricant and is necesary for an advanced society.
Like oil in an engine, fertilizer and middle management, it is an expense.  Things which are designed well and are productive only use the minimum amount.
Too much and everything is gummed up.  Too little and everything seizes up.

            CoaSC and Mow Noname. Excellent points. These instruments and techniques do provide value. However, they are easily exploited and it is encouraged when the people executing them not only don’t see themselves as a part of whom they benefit but who openly hate them. It is almost as if the ruling class needs to hate us and our former country to justify savagely looting it.
I should be and am grateful for those who on balance use these advanced tools for our benefit as many do.

                    I see economic collapse as inevitable anyway, so as long as “DOGE savings” and every other resource are bartered for removing aliens, I’m ok with that. The problem is that resources we are sending to the less noxious jewish faction of Zionism (as opposed to the internationalist predator factions) are not manifesting in cooperation with the most important pre-collapse battlefield preconditioning: alien removal from European soil.

            The DOGE figure of $150 billion ain’t bad for a small team volunteering for a few months.  It’s almost 10% of the deficit.  I have to agree it will probably just be spent elsewhere, but the real benefit was cutting off the Democratic money laundering operation from USAID to their NGOs.

Challenge: Find a real thread on /pol/. Internet canary. It’s never been faker than it is today, and that fakeness isbought, almost entirely with American taxpayer dollars. Early DOGE activity coincided with a brief retreat of certain kinds of demoralization posts, but they’re back—withmassreinforcements.
All we really got was “USAID” added to the list of loser shibboleths. If you say it, they know you’re not one of them. That’s it.

        the current system is dying now, and cannot be fixed because there are no people who know how to fix it.  or replace it.  or do anything that works as intended.  not just here, but in literally every other country as well.  IMO this is because so many systems are interconnected, and there is no real understanding of how they interact.  spaghetti code writ large.

        OT: something from the podcast got me thinking.
Marxists thought they could reprogram people through economics. They did damage, but economics won.
Cultural Marxists (or whatever they’re called) thought culture was the answer. Likewise, but I’d say culture has won.
The current thing is biology, but my money is on biology. Thing is, they’ll probably try to genetically engineer utopians in the meantime. The whole trans thing is probably the beginning.
Each step is more repulsive, fails quicker, but does more damage. The dialectic goes on, needs to be done away with. It’s too ugly.

            You have it backwards, the problem is that China is no longer buying treasury holdings at the rate and size of the past.  I think Tariffs are a band aid.  Not to bring manufacturing back, but to replace lost purchases of t bills and bonds.  Though i might be spouting my “ideology” again 😉

        More economic advice from TheZman. But here are the facts. The Dow made its all-time high on Dec. 4 2024, the NASDAQ on Feb 19 2025, and the S&amp;P on Jan 23 2025. The sell-off was well underway long before Trump announced his tariffs.The longest running joke in financial journalism is that news causes the market to go up and down. The news explanation is always complete nonsense. All my life I’ve been hearing “Dow up—on GOOD inflation numbers,” “S&amp;P down-on BAD nonfarm payrolls,” “Nasdaq up-on GOOD Fed numbers,” “Dow down-on BAD energy numbers.” The chattering classes always have to have a reason for why the market goes up or down.Of course, there are reasons, but they are never the reasons the chattering classes want to believe. Everyday there is good news and bad news, and the chattering classes cherry pick whatever news makes them feel good about whatever happened in the market. And everyone forgets when the chattering classes are wrong.Last week, stock guru Jim Cramer warned that last Monday would be Black Monday and that the market would crash. Instead, there was a strong rally.Here is an alternative explanation. The fed closed the discount window to investment banks. Once the big banks were cut off from cheap money they began to unwind their positions. Thus, we had a sell-off at the all-time highs. The supply of other people’s money dried up, and it was time to cash in the profits to pay off the loans. Now, without cheap money, the big banks have to risk their own capital and they have decided to act rationally.And for the technicians out there, where do you think last week’s rally started? It started at the support/resistance line established in November 2023. The market makers did a level sweep just below the support line to take out all the stop-loss orders, and then rallied the market all week long.So far, we’ve recovered 58% of the drop from the all-time highs. Someone was buying the lows. Did the news suddenly change? Did the prospect more war, suffering, and pain suddenly disappear? No. Big Money sells the all-time highs, and Big Money buys the lows.Anyone hear that explanation in the financial press? Anyone? Beuhler? Beuhler?

        I get the sense that Trump was trying to force the Fed to get involved. His faction is going heavy into stablecoins, which could be an alternative money machine to the Fed, but I don’t know enough about economics to be sure.Anyway, the tariffs are not tariffs. The formula used to calculate them was reverse-engineered, and it has nothing to do with taxing imports to protect domestic industries. It should have been horrible optics when Trump declared “I’m protecting the American economy with tariffs! oops never mind, they’re on hold now that I’m getting what I want out of the negotiations they forced.”They’re just Biden-style economic sanctions.

        Oh, hell yes it’s too late. All that’s left is for the crying to begin. Trump may be stirring things up but he’s always been an afficianado of debt. He’s making ‘changes’ within the system…but he’s still part of it. The middle will not hold. There’ll be myriad attempts to save some sembelance of it, many in desperation towards the end, but in the end it all falls down. The only question is whether it goes kinetic in the process?

        Stellar, quite simply stellar, as always. Explaining the basis trade that caused a eurodollar shortage due to margin calls on collateralized Treasury futures in clear, simple language is a remarkable gift. But then, to top it off with the political ramifications…You see, the Great Depression had nothing to do with Smoot-Hawley or any of the routine tariffs that had immediately preceded it; those myths were simply FDR Democrats blaming Republicans.The liquidity crunch the Zman described is exactly how the Federal Reserve deliberately triggered the Great Depression.It stole the cash, then the gold.And after, no one could pay back their onerous debt, as the Fed suddenly got stingy.This one in 2029 might be for all the marbles; collateralizing the nation’s assets is exactly what Commerce Secretary Lutnick has been so enthusiastic about.Bonus! Blame Bush; the Iraq war was to over-inflate the economy. The Ukraine war was for the same purpose, to ignite a banking crisis in the EU, with NATO’s Atlantic Council coordinating the rollout of CBDC’s. (Remember, we were supposed to be under WHO global dictatorship this May.)Quote: “This is where it is going. It is designed to happen suddenly, and on a vast scale.”For the details, here is the link to the Great Taking. I finished it an hour ago. Not long.https://ia801304.us.archive.org/18/items/the-great-taking-by-david-rogers-webb/The%20Great%20Taking%20by%20David%20Rogers%20Webb.pdf

        Citizen correctly says that there is no alternative to the Eurodollar system, which Mycale correctly points out should have failed in 2008 but they printed their way out of it. Begging the question, is there any crisis that they can’t print their way out of? (Since there is no alternative). And we are then stuck in hyperfinancialized clown world for eternity. Since there is no alternative.

eta: I wouldn’t be surprised at all, btw, that the billionaires who donated millions to the Trump campaign did so on the condition of no prosecutions. Bondi is a joke and was put there for a reason.

        Terminator 3: Rise Against the Machines – It runs everything, it is self aware. Nothing you can do to shut it off. If you try to shut it off, it turns around and attacks you.
Sounds a little like this is what is going on in the financial system.
Much like what passes for our “democracy” these days (or republic if you demand specificity), what passes for our financial system doesn’t really track with what they taught us in school about it.

        I also wonder how much of the bond yield growth last week was due to China and others weaponizing their treasuries. The flight to bonds by institutional investors wasn’t enough to offset the dumping (I think).America is vulnerable when it comes to debt service.  Exploding borrowing costs might have been their return fire.  “Knock it off with the tariffs or we explode your debt.  It’s called a debt bomb for a reason.Watch for lawsuits challenging the legality of the tariffs and Trump’s authority to levy them.  It doesn’t matter that he has the authority.  The purpose of the lawsuits is to get the judiciary to block them.I think it is going to be very tough to change things. It’s necessary, but there is going to be PAIN.

        I want to know if China’s domestic consumption comes anywhere near to being:
1) self sufficient
2) approaching par with the US
That’s what the lefties like Howard Bloom were afraid of, that the RoW wouldn’t need us anymore.
3) how is that alliance between the EU Caliphate and China looking?4) South America and the Panama Canal?  Will the Chinese Navy take Cuba?

            Short answer is no, it doesn’t. Their per capita GDP is $12,900. Ours is $65,000. Granted, it’s a much larger country, but they don’t have widespread discretionary income like Americans do.Just like the 2018-19 tariffs, China will be able to fight for a time. But they cannot sustain it. And the longer they try, the more factories get moved out of China to either low-tariff allies or back to US soil.They lost the 2019 trade war. That’s why they unleashed covid, imo, with the help of their paid allies in the US.I read today that they stopped exporting certain rare earth metals. The only reason the US relies on them is we don’t mine it ourselves (eg environmental regulations). We have the ability to be a nearly perfectly self-contained economy.They don’t.  And the EU put them on notice that they won’t be allowed to dump their crap in Europe.

                To some extent, food, too.  They’re the largest food-importing country in the world.  Lack of farmland, poor climate, bad management.It’s the kind of place American farmers could make productive.  But they’re not capable of it, and they have too many people.It’s a country that, in my lifetime, was a symbol of a country where people were starving to death regularly.The only reason we lose a trade war with China is ChiComm infiltrators on US soil sabotaging Pres Trump.  That includes the industries suing over the tariffs and e-commerce sites like Amazon working to conceal country of origin and offset tariffs.

        Jim Carrol [Band] said it was too late 45 years ago 🙂 For ca. 1980 new wave/punk rock, his social commentary still holds up. Given today’s comments, for damned sure the comment about being so decadent until Daddy’s money from home’s all spent.

There’s an edgier live version with naughtier lyrics, like “It’s too soon, but a bullet’s gonna dance in the brain of Rev. Moon” (which fortunately did not come true.)

            The circa ’80 punks were the last boomers, angry at the other boomers who went straight from hippie to yuppie without acknowledging their “hypocrisy” (because there really wasn’t any).As an SF kid who saw him run for dissident mayor way back when, it seemswrongwhat an absolute regime stooge Jello Biafra is now. But it isn’t wrong. He was just a nerd, and they always submit.Only Johnny Rotten was actually cool—for as long as truly civilized man exists,Metal BoxandThe Flowers of Romancewill be regarded as the greatest albums of their time—and he remains unacceptable now.
