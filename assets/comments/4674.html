        The art of the deal. How to extinguish billions of debt while designing a regimen of austerity that looks harsh, without causing the plebes to rise up and hang the political class?Related, how do you get the Germans to take a haircut and pony up more loans in the name of unity, without causing the volk to turf out Merkel?I suppose this is an improvement over the Bundeswehr marching under the shade trees of Paris.

        You talk as if there were some alternative for the Greeks other than a few different variations of turd sandwich.  Please provide a brief description of that non-turd sandwich alternative.

            Yes there is alternative. They can turn to Moscow for help. Uncle Vlad would pay any price for a warm – water port. But then you would see Ukrainian scenario on the streets of Athens followed by an army coup and then a right wing government run by people whose names begin with Papa.

            If the Greek rulers gave a damn about their people, they would get out of the Euro, default on their debts to Europe, make a deal with Putin (navy bases, air fields) and go back to the Drachma. It would suck for a year, maybe two, but the Greek economy would pull out of it and get back to normal.

                Not quite true, Z. The Greeks elected a government whose policies were to preserve the way things are for the Greeks, without ‘austerity.’ I can’t see how things get better if Putin’s lot were in charge of the money: they might hand over fee for a base or two on the Med but if they wanted to make sure Greece carried on they would want say in their economy and policies. Can’t see Moscow allowing the Greeks to dispense generous cash handouts when that might not suit them at all.Also, what for the Greeks is normal? I thought this was it.

                    All of that may be true, but that reinforces my point about the nature of rule in the West. It’s no longer a game between competing factions trying to win the public over to their side. Today the people in charge have their agenda and the facade of democracy is just a show. It’s the bread and the circus. The Greeks can vote themselves silly and the results will not change. Their government is a fiction.

        There are those who believe the next wave will be apocalyptic and centralized authority will be collapsed.  They migrate to areas such as the American Redoubt and prepare for a survivalist lifestyle.  Who knows?  I figure the skimmers probably have that scenario covered and will surface in control anyway.  The best we can all do is live as well today as possible and hope for the best.

        I can’t say that I recognise your description of the current situation here in the U.K. My take on it is that most of us will be happy if all the human rights crap is dumped (new British bill of rights) and more powers are returned to Westminster, I believe they will.

            My bet is Cameron gets a bunch of promises from the EU about changes they will make to accommodate England. This will happen before the vote and he will wave it around as proof reform is possible. The vote will go his way and those promised reforms will never materialize. Instead, EU integration will accelerate.
Elections are just a show.

        Tocqueville, letters to an English friend-The spectacle now exhibited by England, in which a party finds no difficulty in maintaining itself in power by carrying into practice ideas which it has always opposed, and by relying for support on its natural enemies, is not of a nature to raise the reputation of your institutions, or of your public men.I perceive that we have destroyed those individual powers which were able, single-handed, to cope with tyranny; but it is the government alone that has inherited all the privileges of which families, guilds, and individuals have been deprived; to the power of a small number of persons, which if it was sometimes oppressive was often conservative, has succeeded the weakness of the whole community.Princes had…turned violence into a physical thing but our democratic republics have made it into something as intellectual as the human will it intends to restrict.The consequences of this state of affairs are dire and dangerous for the future.

            I agree.  The trend line I’m starting to see is that the skimmers finally figure out that they don’t need the marginal to be filthy rich.  Some days I think we are already in that territory.  If the message of environmentalism and feminism was “stop having kids,” then the message of the climate change movement is “just die already.”

        I’m at a loss where to even begin to answer your question, Z man.  Seven years ago, smart people were predicting the China and Japan were at the end of their rope.  That they couldn’t afford to buy any more U.S. debt to balance their capital accounts and keep their currencies undervalued against the dollar.  Yet Japan’s debt continues to sit in the prestigious “Zimbabwe zone” and nothing happens.The Dow industrial index is very obviously being manipulated to keep pension funds afloat.  No big deal.During the worries over the PIIGS, there should have been panics and bank runs.  Hell, in Cyprus the EU seized account holders’principal.  Just another day.As the EU population ages and small businesses shutter without buyers and farms go fallow for want of a purchaser, everything about history and economics I know of predicts a civilization crushing spiral of deflation.  Nope, business as usual.The skimmers seem to have eliminated the need to skim.  Maybe they have golden egg laying geese in their Hampton estates?It reminds me of the time I had a small infection on my arm.  Rather than just lancing the damn thing, I kept wrapping it and putting warm compresses on it so I wouldn’t miss any games or practices.  When the doctor finally did lance it, it was a real mess, took two days to drain, and I was pretty darn lucky not to get septicemia.
