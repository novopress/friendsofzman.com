                    That’s a pretty good deal for her tbh. Endure for a few minutes, in exchange for a lifetime of riches and fame. You’d think she could have been more grateful. Something about Briffault’s Law I guess.

                        Bruce Dern comes from money and is about is WASPish as you can get. He plays everyman, but his grandfather was a Governor of Utah and Secretary of War. His father ran a utility company and was a distinguished attorney. His mother was Scottish and Dern was related through her to poet Archibald McLeish.
Blythe Danner is of English/Irish and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.

            Hollywood and public education have been the two biggest drivers in our decline by far.  They both need to go, at least in their current form.  Maybe it is just me, but there seems to be a real decline in the interest of celebrity culture also.  15-20 years ago, normies followed the opinions of the carnies closely and they had some influence.  Now it seems as though no one cares what they think and when they do wade into politics they are met with scorn.

                Public schools are on the ropes. Between insane school boards and flooding them with migrants, we’re not far from a huge migration to private schools. The only thing stopping it is cost, but parents will do just about anything to protect their kids.

                    Public school enrollment is on the decline in most states.  The reasons are a combination of declining birth rates and families doing everything they can to get out of them whether private or home schooling.  This is why the insane NEA President was ranting about immigration at the LA Riots.  They desperately need immigrant kids in public schools to keep the money flowing to them.  If we can drive enrollment low enough, the system can be scrapped and overhauled.

                        Declining enrollment has multiple blessings. One of the only ways to get rid of a tenured public school teacher (outside of them doing something illegal) is to demonstrate declining enrollment and thus less of a need for teachers. The shrieking harridans are all on the chopping block fighting for their jobs.

                            Most librarians are female leftist freaks and shrews.  Most libraries have become slight variants of computer centers; they are abominations.  Most people cannot think, let alone read.  Between emojis and ebonic/electronic abbreviations, we’ve regressed to pictographs.  Imma hurl.

It is lovely after a battle ‘outside’ to retreat to your mountain, no?  Certainly I have, just as many times as I could manage in my life.  About all I miss about America is the Western mountain ranges.
Easier to com with God when you’re holed up in the tall pine and the great doug fir, got a creek nearby.  Won’t get any closer to heaven in this world.

                        Quite right. Friends of mine had their daughter in a small, private school in CT (Wooster School) a few years ago and it was a great fit. A year and a half later, new principal who brought her daughter along. The principal was militant woke and her freak of a daughter – along with her friends – patrolled the school like the gestapo. Anything they overheard that they didn’t like, they ran right to the principal and ratted the other kids out. After being told by the principal that if they didn’t like it, tough shit, my friends pulled their daughter out and put her in another school.

                Part of the reason is that they could take a real life carney like Cary Grant (he was a circus acrobat, wasn’t he?), put him through finishing school to teach him some social graces and he becomes larger than life as the lovable rogue with high class tastes he played in most movies. Now they grab any low life out of the gutter without bothering with the finishing school part. Johnny Depp could easily still be back in the hollers of Kentucky being your local dope dealer. No class at all.

                        I stood in line at the grocery store next to a small fellow- he looked about 9- with tiny diamond stud earrings.
This was such an odd thing to see in a 1970s one-stoplight little Nevada town I was taken aback, so I chatted him up a bit. Turns out his acrobat family was traveling through as part of the circus. He was out, just looking around.
What struck me, though, was his air of serene confidence and capable competence. Pure Alpha. It was the same kind of cool magnetism that Cary Grant exuded.

        Hollywood’s problems can be summed up by the movie the Joker and its sequel. The Joker was a huge hit, raking in over a billion dollars. However, it appealed to men whom Hollywood hates and for reasons that Hollywood finds repulsive. So they created a shitlib sequel that tanked. Most of Hollywood, especially the foreign tribe who runs it and white women, would rather lose money than create products for people they hate.

            The Saturday person who directed Joker seems to have gotten the message from his handlers that the wrong people liked Joker and he needed to fix it. If I recall, he even said as much about the audience in interviews leading up to the release of Joker 2. It is insane how much these people hate us, Joker 2 probably lost hundreds of millions of dollars but it’s worth it to rub our face in it.

                Conservatives have been banking on “they’ll go out of business!” for the past 40 years when it comes to culture and education. This is due to their inability to model other minds. They project their own tastes and mindset on the American population as a whole, and assume that because they would not produce something that would “lose money” (they don’t understand how a Hollywood film “loses money”), then eventually, others will follow suit.The market will punish them,those basket-weaving majors won’t get jobs, they said while shaving each morning. It cannot be corrected; it only ends when a generational style of thinking dies out with its thinkers (ahem).

                        I’d argue that the real conservative failure was the failure to realize that the US university system is like a communist-controlled flock of tens of millions of golden geese that poop out golden eggs on a daily basis.
Why would the commies ever worry about money when they have a system like that under their complete control?

                    It’s a postage stamp sized area that needs redevelopment. As Whiskey pointed out yesterday, Karen Bass of the Cuban Venceremos Brigades is drooling at the prospect of “enterprise zone” redevelopment funds. (She’s also loving the camera, as well.)
Me, I’m with Jimmy Dore on this. It’s manufacturing consent for the rollout of Palantir Juden technocracy, as Musk has synchronized the DC database.

        “Hollywood looked at the social capital and wondered how they could turn it into quick cash”That is being generous. Hollywood is run by an alien tribe that felt it was time to show how much they hated White people and normal life. That was more important than making money and to a large degree still is. The studios are filled with people who hate their viewers.Maybe that will change as the Chinese gain more control (because making money rules with Chinese) but no one knows.I mainly read but, as a break, watch some  streaming because I can cherry pick from around the world works that aren’t woke. When it comes to American ones that means movies and TV from over 10 years ago.But to Z’s point about the social square. If I went bowling it would be alone or with my family. You can no longer avoid political talk which is usually clueless and few people can tolerate the types of things we discuss here.

                    Seriously?
Get out of debt, stay out of debt, lower your spending to the point where your income doesn’t need to exceed the standard deduction.
It’s not the luxurious, faux-rich lifestyle everyone seems to want to have nowadays, nor is it easy, but it works if your goal is to stop paying for “government”.
Welfare bums and the “homeless” could be said to be working the same angle, but as government dependents they’re not doing anything to further the cause of reducing “government”, which I presume is one of your unspoken goals.

And every time I curse and throw down the kindle, my husband encourages me to read one of his nonfiction books – but that’s exactly what I’m trying to escape from (since I can’trewrite it).

                        Gutenberg is your friend.  Hundreds of thousands if not millions of books.  Archive has all of the pulps scanned too.  I just read 2 stories from them, When Worlds Collide and After Worlds Collide, though they are sci-fi, which is more my thing.  But I’m pretty sure there are pulps that specialize in who done it and Westerns.  If you go back far enough, no woke, no race mixing, no superwomen and all of the other SJW BS.I read a story by Jules Verne (years ago) called “Off on a Comet” and it is about the most unwoke mainstream fiction I’ve ever read. The plot is partially driven by a duplicitous Jewish merchant who has his scale rigged to give a higher weight and never stops whining, especially when it comes to his money.  It’s hilarious.  The usual suspects tried organizing against Verne and the book to keep it off the shelves. But it was the 19th century, so there was little they could do about it.

                    Speaking of which, I was inside Sheetz in what is now kind of a trashy part of town. In the 10 minutes I was there, three black-white couples. Of course, the female was white. Fortunately, they were middle-aged so they aren’t going to be pooping out any halfrican kids, but what the hell is wrong with white women these days?

        The social aspects of just about everything have been wrecked by “diversity”.  I simply don’t want to go any place (at least willingly) where I have to be around or deal with it.  When I was growing up, it was a novelty.  These days, you have to work hard just to minimize it.

            Move to vanishing rural White America.  I go to town once a week.  In a bad week, I may see one black or mestizo (albeit never in a position of authority or even service).  In a normal week I see and deal with nothing but White heritage Americans.  Friendly, courteous, helpful.  I actually smile at strangers now, wait patiently if there’s a line, and feel blessed to live here.

                Our nearby town in the next valley is the same way. When the foreigners from Atlanta show up to gawk and take pictures at the waterfalls and the mountain vistas, they’re treated coolly at best and with disdain at worst.

                They keep trying to convince us otherwise. Just this morning I saw a tourism ad for the state of Michigan. It showed a black guy in a kayak out on some lake with a laptop and desk lamp mounted on the front of thing. The people that made that one were probably having a bit of fun with their boss’ requirements – “Let’s have an outdoorsy scene with some DIEversity”. This country is a parody of itself.

        A small-hatted acquaintance has spent hundreds of thousands subsidizing a daughter in NYC. She is a talent agent with a major player and doesn’t earn enough income to support herself.
I’ve shared with him evidence that AI will destroy the role of a talent agent with all non-stage performances. The daughter is fixated on continuing to play talent agent no matter her reality.

They’re truly myopic with no self-awareness. The problem is they burrow into their host and take it down with them.
Their whole modus operandi could be change and they assimilate but the easy short term gains are too tempting and they go full schizo on us. It’s a wonder they persist. I suppose something else would replace them.

        The retreat to our private cultures is America’s future – at best. The great separation will continue, whether it be people physically moving to areas more in tune with their race and culture or people joining clubs, schools, churches and other organizations in their area to be around people like themselves.
The public square will be for negotiations among the various tribes. Naturally, this will continue to erode our infrastructure and government. Nothing public will be seen as “ours,” so why maintain it.

            The monoculture is absolutely dead which is bad for the people who controlled it. I would say the only thing that maintains cultural dominance is some parts of sportsball, which is probably why there has been so much focus on it in terms of social engineering the past 10 years. Watch ESPN and if you didn’t know better you would think it is 2015 with the way they talk about things. Commentators have noted that while corporate America has largely retreated from “pride month”, all the sports leagues and teams are prominently displaying the rainbowed version of their logo.But there are signs things are beginning to fray as it did with broader culture.

                I’ve been anticipating a “spoke and hub” society for a while. Major metro areas acting as the hub for work/commerce, and ethnic enclaves in the ‘burbs surrounding it.

                    What c matt says has precedent: when I stepped foot in my first East Coast city, Boston, you could see a stark difference between the neighborhoods.  Democrat Party-enforced segregation law had created stark ethnic territories, divided by invisible markers as thin as one small street.
Walking from block to block, I passed through gingered Irish speaking brogue, swarthy Mediterraneans chatting in Italian, Caribbean darkies calling in Creole, Latinos in rapid-fire Spanish.  They lived and had their Tinker’s Streets in spokes, while mixing only in communal hubs.

            It is America’s present. The self-sorting is rendering the concept of states and regions somewhat obsolete. Sure, political jurisdictions can make laws and immiserate, but increasingly they cannot enforce their edicts. Whites are about the only group that obeys law now as it is, and that’s going away. Someone has suggested that Trump give pre-emptive pardons to people who refuse to pay income taxes unless illegal aliens are deported. Clever, but we are on the verge of such a thing being unnecessary–people will stop paying soon enough. Expect a different mode of extraction, and that also will have a limited run.I doubt the HOA model as a form of local government will be all that great, either, but that’s the current trajectory. And you are right: there is no incentive to maintain infrastructure of any nature, including school and judicial systems, for aliens. Force works now to extract wealth but it is becoming increasingly tenuous. The Open Society is a nightmare but it may prove self-correcting without having to endure the Yugoslavia misfortune.

        The mandates of modern Amerika — race pandering, explicit sex everywhere, and the real killer, feminism and its $MeToo totalitarianism — doomed Hollywood.  It insists on making war on the people who built it, white men (you built nothing, Obozo).Mary Sue Empowered kicks the white man’s ass.  Masculine, white heroes are degraded before being transformed into character containers pleasing to the woke-fem politburo: females who are instantly perfect and need undergo neither training nor struggle, of-coloreds, and homos.Hollywood had everything, threw it away to lecture and humiliate its betters.  Hollywood chose to be my enemy, just like New Amerika.  Tra la la baby. May it die a gruesome death.

                As you say, nobody wants it except the fembots and the white haters. It is far more important to wound and discomfit us than to make money or art.
That’s how you know it’s a spiritual war.

            There has always been a level of subversion in Hollywood films.  The perversion really took off after they ditched the Hays Code and now it’s in full bloom.Devin Stack had a good series on Hollywood subversion of our values several years ago.

            This stuff has been there a long time.  You can see messaging really start to infiltrate TV and film as early as the 50s and 40s.
I just watched a 40s movie with James Stuart (it’s a wonderful life guy) in it where he plays the reluctant SJW reporter who fights to get a cop killer (a foreigner, of course) out of prison, “Call Northside 777, 1949”  Lots of propaganda.  Allegedly based on a true story.  Miracle date on a newspaper blown up from a photo supposedly proves the witness could have theoretically lied.  “Real killers” never caught.

        You forget another important aspect killing Hollywood: YouTube. Especially with the under 40s crowd, I can watch some anti-white, leftist, or just plain bad movie/series on a streaming service, or I can sit for an hour and binge and hour or two of YouTube videos. The zoomers will even watch twitch livestreams of other people playing video games before watching a tv show. Heck, I’ve seen groups of friends all watching a movie “together” and half the group is just doomscrolling TikTok and instagram.

            I would agree and add that YouTube is doing to film and long for television what the internet did to books. People will watch a short video, but increasingly struggle to focus on longer video. The short attention span cultivated by the internet is killing long form across the board.

                YouTube has also backed off on copyright infringement beatdowns. I think what they do now is they leave copyright infringing videos up, but won’t let you monetize them.
For example, I like watching the movie “Charley Varrick” every so often. I couldn’t find it playing anywhere for free, but it’s there on YouTube and it has been for a while.

                There are thousands of old TV shows, movies and films on youtube.  I just finished watching the Boston Blackie (a knockoff of The Lone Wolf) hour long film series on youtube.  I think these hour long films were for matinees in the theaters from the 30s to the 50s.  Some good, some not so good.
I have prime which comes with the prime delivery and it absolutely blows. You have to watch commercials and get a horrible selection.  It’s almost entirely modern b movies. Every single time I go on there looking for a particular film, it’s not available.

                        Thanks.  I’ll check it out.  Never heard of it.Someone uploaded all the episodes of The Untouchables, which was a pretty good series.But the problem with youtube is these things go up and down like crazy and there are usually multiple copies of the same film, so it’s hard to keep track of what you watch other than writing it down somewhere.  I used to leave a comment like “OK, watched 11/24” but that quickly proved useless.

                    ok.ru/video is great for finding any old movie you want free and ad free (I don’t think it was meant to be ad free but evidently the ads were set up to run in russia and don’t seem to work here). But you have to put in a little effort to find the original English language version of a movie among all the dubbed foreign language ones.

                Postcards From Barsoom makes a magnificent case that youtube and the internet are doing to university what Gutenberg’s press did to monasteries: erasing the demonic university system as the head of the cultural hydra.
This will return clubs of learning and apprenticeships of skill to true meritocratic status, unleashing the creative power of our civilization.
His case is laid out remarkably well- what gets me are the paintings of the abandoned monasteries, ruined hubs of vast wealth, power, and privilege (as our colleges are today.)

Monasteries weren’t simply enclaves for credentialed eggheads as our universities are, though. They were hospitals, food-banks, emergency shelters and whatever else the local populace needed, and (in England, at least) they weren’t abandoned so much as seized by the crown and then doled out to the Protestantnouveau richein exchange for various favours. Social dysfunction in England skyrocketed after the dissolution of the monasteries and only really began to abate in the 19th century.

            And you forgot one as well: FAST Channels (Free Ad-Supported Streaming TV). Between Pluto, Tubi, FreeVee and a few others what the hell do I need cable or paid streaming for? The movies are generally older, but a lot of them are not too old. So what if I’ve seen Jack Reacher 10 times? It’s an entertaining enough movie and it’s mostly background noise while I’m doing something else anyway. Terminator 2 again? It was on last night while I was cleaning up my office.

                There is a lot on youtube as well. No commercials.  Over the winter I watched a bunch of Stephen King movies on youtube.  If you like really old stuff, like B&amp;W, there are thousands upon thousands of them.

                        I just deleted hundreds of gigabytes of TV shows I recorded with my converter box DVR that I copied to the hard drive.  I was running out of space and I didn’t want to buy yet another hard drive.  I kept some, ones I’ve yet to watch, but on a cheap thumb drive I bought.
Most of the stuff I watch on youtube hasn’t seen a TV screen in decades and are unlikely to be permanently erased from youtube.  I just cannot watch most new TV shows and movies.  Even when they are not pure propaganda, they are unwatchable garbage.

                One of the benefits of living near an urban center is the availability of digital TV broadcasts over the air that to watch you need only an inexpensive antenna on your bookshelf or windowsill.I’ve been using it to watch old TV westerns and Star Trek episodes and it reminds me of the days when those programs were new: you only get what’s currently being broadcast instead of being able to browse the catalog, and if you miss the beginning of the show, you can’t rewind it.There are commercials too, of course, but I’m finding most of them amusing. I especially enjoy the ads for new inventions hawked by pitchmen with frenetic Sham-Wow voices. You’ll also get another gizmo, a $50 value, but it’s yours for free!!!

        The whole streaming thing is one of the more hilarious self-owns I have ever seen in business. You now have to have 15 different subscriptions if you want to watch everything, so people just hop around and wait for deals and cancel instead of in the past where you just had cable and paid it every month. The price transparency and annoyance of juggling these services has killed the loyalty people had for these studios and their products. The companies also invested massively in IP and brands – Disney spent $70 billion on Fox – and then threw it on a service that made that IP totally disposable and value-less. They spend millions of dollars to make TV shows and then people consume it in a weekend and cancel. It’s crazy and it shows that these elites – and these are elites, these are our social engineers – are really not smarter or more intelligent than anyone else, and they fundamentally misunderstand not just our society, but their own product and the millieu it came from.

            Zman makes some valid points, but since he really seems to want to write about culture, he misses several factors that made streaming non-viable.And one obvious one is what you just pointed out, that the way to do this would have been to have the studios get together, and created a single platform, so people would just have to subscribe to a single platform, and then parcel out the net revenue among the studios based on views or some other metric.And by the way, the reason they didn’t do this, and it would have been a fairly obvious course of action, is that large American businesses simply stopped valuing even basic competence in their hiring decisions some time ago.  This also produces worse movies and TV shows, which is also starting to drive down the viewership.

                Yeah, that’s something they don’t seem to get. I’m not going to pay to watch Peacock and Paramount Plus on top of that, and Disney on top of that.But then again, we had all that stuff together in one place, cable. They ended up killing the golden goose by getting too greedy, dumbing down content, maximizing commercials, getting greedy with fees.I simply don’t like the content enough to pay for it anymore. If it’s not on Free TV or free internet, I’m not interested. If you’re also going to run 12 minutes of commercials in a row, I’m also not interested.

            It is fascinating that these titans of media did not note that you make billions in American by controlling a bottleneck or a monopoly, not through competition. That said, I suspect Disney assumed that if they bought up the best content, the other services would wither and then they could wield near monopoly power.
What they fail to grasp is piracy is unstoppable. It is the thing no one discusses, but is real and real easy. If you want sports and entertainment, getting it free is simple.

                IIRC, Hulu was initially set up as a kind of “not-Netflix” which was meant to offer content from many studios. But they got greedy and decided that instead of splitting the pie they should make their own. It didn’t work that way and melted down soon after, although Hulu still exists in skeleton form (mostly through FOX content and offering ESPN and Disney bundles).

                Disney understood those issues and piracy too (perhaps better than anyone). But you’re absolutely right that Disney over-estimated the power of their content relative to the power of the streaming business model. Netflix/Amazon got a huge amount of money for new content so they got better. Then Disney’s content got worse. By then, Disney was late to streaming and had crap content to boot. This isn’t a new problem; many media executives failed to appreciate technology and distribution paradigm shifts. Remember AOL/Time Warner? Ted Turner is one of the rare media executives who also understood technological change. George Lucas is another. They were different worlds that have now converged.

            These things run in cycles. Hollywood has had waves of outsiders influence it heavily, so it hasn’t had a consistent management culture. When I first came to the business (mid-80s), Hollywood was bad and outsiders (eg Sony and Ted Turner) came to the industry to try to reform it. In fact, this whole outsider wave started (if you don’t count Howard Hughes) in the 60s when Gulf&amp;Western acquired a struggling Paramount and turned it around brilliantly. Kirk Kerkorian bought MGM and did the same. The Bronfmans (Seagrams) also bought Universal a few years later. Money talks. When all the current fads fail, money men will come and implement change as they always do.

            I do want to put in a slight correction in that Netflix only makes money due to accounting gimmicks.
Streaming video content did what streaming audio content did: cheapened the overall product which resulted in a feedback loop where the product itself was made more and more cheaply to, basically, compete with itself.

        your overall point is valid, but hollywood is dying because it churns out tons of genuinely bad product.  the streaming sites – including netflix – have an insatiable demand for content, and aren’t fussy about how good it is.  this lack of concern for quality has infected every studio and production company.  oh look another tv series about an independent lady cop who does things her way!another failing of the streaming sites is the narrowness of their offerings.  almost exclusively post 2010 productions.  the rental stores had a much greater variety of offerings than any streaming site, since the rental stores could stock titles from *every* studio.want to give a plug to the Tubi channel – which is free – and has a huge variety of titles, many that are first rate (and some that are fun but not so good quality).  lots of ads however kind of spoil it for me.

                I’m sure AI will make producing this slop even cheaper and easier than ever. No more need to pay overpriced whores and gayboys to play their cartoonish characters in capeshit movies. Now, with AI, the whole film is CGI, including the script. Pure profit.
On the one hand it means even further concentration of wealth. On the other, all those obnoxious sluts and twinks will be begging on the street to pay their drug dealers.

                Advertising is on. From the standpoint of the networks, the ideal situation is to have on cheap, addictive, and worthless content to have the rubes glued to the screens, so that they can be bombarded with endless commercials. That’s the business model.

        Hollywood was a great conduit for the establishment’s propaganda back in the day. While that was mostly frittered away before the COVID lockdowns, what little was left of its usefulness to The Project was eliminated for good during the lockdowns. Same with the schools. Hilariously, the establishment was shocked, shocked I tell you, to find that even after those two propaganda vectors were re-deployed they no longer worked like before, nor could they be rebooted into their erstwhile state of usfulness.Meanwhile, the bulk of the “content consuming public, – ie the lumpen masses – now have the attention span of a stillborn dust mite thanks to the newfangled streaming paradigm.Seldom has collapse of a long ingrained system looked at once so appealing and appalling at the same time.

            This is a very good point. Every post-print media has been heavily regulated in a way to ensure a propaganda monopoly–radio and television, for example, were controlled through licensing and other regulatory requirements. The Supreme Court created a ludicrous fiction that the Founders meant only print to get around the obvious First Amendment (which is a fraud) violations. Films also were controlled, originally through the Motion Pictures Production Code/Legion of Decency, which gave the illusion of free expression regulated via private agreement. After the Jewish takeover of Hollywood and government, monopolies and other anti-free market devices were deployed to regulate content albeit for different reasons.Panic swept across police state apparatuses when the Internet emerged, and particularly so with social media. It was a battle they always were doomed to lose despite best efforts.The changing political landscape, which is heading directly toward totalitarianism, is a last-ditch effort to restore the information monopoly. I suspect promotion of AI and the emergence of psychopaths like Karp is a rearguard effort to discredit readily available information that is not state-approved.

        Another factor killing movie theaters is the wide availability of high quality home video and audio products at reasonable prices.

Sure, the theater screen and sound are objectively better, but not so much so that one is going to put up with ticket prices, expensive crap food, and obnoxious public behavior.

        While we are discussing all the business and cultural related reasons for the decline of Hollywood, which do have validity, I tend to believe that the industry would still do ok, in spite of all that, if they made any content worth watching. But in the last 10-15 years (I might even say the last quarter century) that is virtually zero. That’s your real culprit right there. People will watch good content. But where is it?

                Also, another thing i noticed around that time, more and more actors appearing from the 5eyes.  England, Europe, Australia.  And a lot of the films were being filmed in Eastern Europe at the time because it was cheap (early 2000’s).  I guess regions couldn’t support their own film industries anymore so had to consolidate into globohomo?

            It is highly doubtful that even if Hollywood turned out content like it did in its Golden Age that people would return to theaters due to vibrancy, among other things. As someone else pointed out here, even streaming services would continue to struggle due to severely decreased attention spans caused by digital delivery systems. Many very early films were far shorter, an hour or so, but would that be short enough?There probably would be some uptick if the content improved but it would not be enough to revive the industry. I suspect film is about to join Vaudeville on the ash heap of history soon.

                We were turned away from the theaters a few times in the late 90’s and early 2000’s due to riots.  Once on Christmas Day.  That didn’t stop us, i’d say they’ve turned people off with their attitudes more so, like modern women 😉

We were shrews for a decade, why don’t men want us anymore?
For example, the movie bridesmaids was funny.  The theater was packed and everyone was laughing.  The Ghostbusters remake bombed, all the same actors, why?  Politics……..

        Another thing about streaming that I find so loathsome is how it’s just another corporate attempt to nickel and dime the consumer at every point of even the simplest transaction.

It’s clear that Hollywood wants physical media to disappear so they can charge you over and over again to be able to watch a movie under even barely acceptable circumstances.  I’m hoping these never ending attempts by businesses today to scam you out of every single penny in your pocket and every single moment of your spare time causes grief to a lot of other industries besides Hollywood.

            Ever since screens became a thing, people have worshipped the people on the screens, whether they were actors in movies, or just lying pieces of shit like Walter Cronkite. You’ll note the difference in status between the screen actor and the stage actor (who cares about the Tonys?). The status of actors was never about acting, it was about the screen. Nowadays folks have found new screen dwellers to worship who are encroaching on the old’s turf. Since after 15 years of smartphonedom they don’t really have the attention span for movies anymore.

        “Of course, the dynamics of the American film market is why the studios now look to foreign markets for profit. This means more films high on big flashy effects and low on sensible dialogue and plot.”I don’t know when this started. Was it the martial arts films made in Hong Kong in the ’60s and ’70s? The Bruce Lee films? The Spaghetti Westerns made by Sergio Leone and others, with a cast that largely couldn’t speak English at all? Was it the Alistair MacLean films likeThe Guns of Navarone? Was it the Star Wars films? Was it the Stallone films — the Rocky and Rambo series — where the plot (if it deserves to be called one) can be understood entirely without knowing a word of English? The recent films I’ve cited have all been made for a global viewership that wants spectacle, special effects, and loud noises of the same kind that the Roman lumpenproles wanted from the gladiatorial contests. Coupled with this is that American viewers have become less discriminating themselves. We are moving to the bleak future depicted inIdiocracy, where TV series likeOw, My Ballsand films likeAssbecome popular.Off the top of my head, the last plot-driven film I watched wasRemains of the Day, based on a book by a Japanese writer. No special effects, no loud noise. Not even much drama, and everything very understated, and requiring reading between the lines. I pine for the days of Orson Welles.

            If you like Orson Welles, check out this commercial he was voicing.  Listening to a great director not wanting to take direction from a director of commercials is pretty amusing.

        On the one hand, streaming robs from the theaters, especially small local theaters, by removing cheap content they would use to attract daytime audiences in the summerOut of interest, how many here ever have gone to a theater in the daytime? I’m older than most commenters but I can’t recall the last time because it was so long, long ago–70’s-ish, I think. Soon enough, if not now, the question will be, “have you ever watched a film in a theater?” A few years back a popular stat was something like two-thirds of younger people had never eaten at McDonald’s (good for them). I bet more than that have never been in a theater.

                I had forgotten the AC aspect (I’m a native Southerner, too).
You also are older than many if not most commenters here, though. Maybe I should refine the question to “how many here under 40 ever have been to a movie in the daytime?” I suspect, maybe wrongly, it is basically non-existent.

                    Our local theater showed  serials from the 50s on Saturdays (The Lone Ranger, Batman, Hopalong Cassidy, etc.) and the place was packed with screaming boys. Admission was a certain number of RC Cola bottle caps. Eventually, it became a porno theater and then went out of business.

                In 1982/1983 I was living “The Vanlife” in Pensacola, Florida. That van was my home, and I played in a country bar band at night. During the weekdays I spent all day at the public library, plus visits to the gym. Sundays presented a problem: all my usual daytime hangouts were closed. This presented a problem in summer, as the heat was unbearable. Fortunately, a local movie theater charged only fifty cents for their daytime matinee, and although I had to watch Albert Finney sleepwalk through “Looker” “Wolfen” and “Blame It On Rio”, at least I got to enjoy cool, dark comfort for a few hours every Sunday.By the way, the last time I set foot in a theater was when “Dances With Wolves” premiered in Coeur d’ Alene in the Spring of 1991. The audience was 100% white, quiet and well-behaved. I’m guessing that type of audience is now nonexistent, even in Idaho.

            I “do The Cinema” maybe three or four times a year; nearly always matinee shows. My most recent was for last year’s Nosferatu reboot (December 2024?) The film was pretty good, incidentally, although I still prefer W. Hertzog’s take.

            (Delurking to respond)I used to go to matinee shows back in the mid-90s at The Brattle Theatre in Harvard Square. They had annual themed revival weeks, i.e Bugs Bunny cartoons. The place was packed with fellow Gen X adults and each time a new short was introduced, everyone would cheer and applaud, since each of the offerings was so well known and loved. One year they offered the early James Bond films, and many in the audience were Boomer age with their teen kids. The kids all cracked up at the antiquated tech and obvious double-entendre one liners. The was before the Bond films were scooped up by cable and run to death.

        In case anyone is interested in recommendations for recent releases that still have the feel of old school Americana, i have two suggestions that I very much enjoyed. The first is “The bikeriders” with Tom Hardy, and the second is “Desperation Road” with Mel Gibson in a secondary role. Both include new acting talent that actually act and no special effects.

        I always scratched my head at Amazon original content. You got access to all of their shows for free with your prime subscription. Access to Amazon media was not a compelling reason to get prime. 2-day delivery was. It seemed like they were giving things away for free. Now they have commercials on Prime, so I guess they are finding a way to make money.The Expanseand the awfulRings of Powerwere vanity projects for Bezos since he supposedly liked the source material. Streaming services also never release numbers for who’s watching what, so outlandish claims about the popularity of garbage are uncontestable. Even shareholders don’t get numbers. Not sure how that’s legal.The problem with streaming services now is that you have to get all of them to be able to watch everything you want. It’s more expensive than cable. There’s a good analog to this. In the early 2000s, Gabe Newell of Valve studios had a problem. Piracy was rampant in the video game industry. He decided he was going to do something about it. He set out to make it so cheap and easy to buy games that nobody would bother pirating. Steam was born. Blizzard had a similar concept with Battle-dot-net, but it never really achieved the same concept until later. Steam originally only sold Valve software, but other developers piled on and now Steam is the single most popular retailer of games. Around 2017ish, companies smelled blood in the water and stopped offering their products on Steam and established their own storefront apps. Epic games was designed to kill Steam. It didn’t work. Bethesda, and a bunch of other companies ended up shuttering their digital stores. Steam is still on top with a complete monopoly with the exception of niche sellers like Galaxy of Games, which specializes in bringing back very old games. Another great feature of steam is its rating system and the ability to see how many people are playing the game as well as historical data on how many people played it. You can’t polish a turd on Steam.The problem Hollywood has now is that it’s far easier and cheaper to pirate their content than it is to pay for a half dozen streaming services. Find a shady site, use a built-in browser extension to save the stream (no screwing around with malware-laden torrents), stick it on a flash drive, and plug it into your smart TV. Younger generations are largely technologically illiterate despite (or perhaps because of) growing up as “digital natives,” but millennials and Xers are old hats at piracy. The problem for Hollywood is that, boomers aside, these are the two generations with the most disposable income and whom streaming is primarily marketed to. The streaming services are currently flunking the prisoner’s dilemma, but given who tends to run things in this industry (Eskimos), that’s hardly surprising. At this rate, there’s barely anything to watch that’s decent that comes out, so it’s further compounding the reasons not to pay a subscription.

            Also Valve is dealing with a competitor who built a “streaming” service and has devalued their games in the same way that the studios did. It seems like mostly the rest of the industry is not taking the bait, although it’s certainly hurt itself in other areas.The generational turnover is going to be interesting. Hollywood has spent the past decade catering to aging Millennials and older and just assuming Zoomers would hop on board… but they haven’t. Zoomers don’t care about Soy Wars or the diverse new Scream or whatever. But they did turn out in droves for Minecraft. It seems they would watch content made for them, but Hollywood doesn’t seem know how to do that, probably because they’ve been making boomerslop for 40 years.

        To the extent losses from the crapola Hollywood keeps churning out offsets profits from their other divisions may keep the woke from going broke for longer than we would expect. Plus the contractors that supply services to Hollywood, I doubt they’re operating at a loss, must be a lot of cronyism going on there, just like with government contractors.

        True “long tail” underground word-of-mouth, the kind that made it so everybody lovesThe Thingnow, was killed by fake reviews. Forums and comments were shut down, moderated into submission, strategically flooded with bots (and Indians pretending to be bots). Rating sites were rigged to hide audience hatred for corporate slop. The enthusiast press was destroyed so corporate messaging wouldn’t be contradicted.Dudes talking on the internet is the greatest threat to the system, says the system, and it works tirelessly to thwart us. One of dudes’ favorite conversational bonding rituals is movie recommendations. All our “cult classics” and “overlooked masterpieces” came frombullshittin’. That doesn’t really happen anymore. “Media literacy” does. “Underrated” and “forgotten” lists are made and consumed, but nobody checks the source (watches the movies, listens to the albums, whatever).Letterbox lists are madeto be judged by, like a dating profile, not to tell your friends about some cool shit. RedLetterMedia will show nerds a hundred movies they never heard of, but they won’t watch them. They’ll watch another RedLetterMedia video (next product).I think the last gasp of true film fan word-of-mouth was when some anonymous oldfag told 4chan aboutAfrica Addio.(You’re welcome.) Can youbuyit anywhere? Nope. Libertarianism refuted by “the market” for the billionth time this week.

            The Thingdidn’t do well initially for many reasons. One is being released in the middle of an upbeat summer season versus Spielberg’s warm and fuzzyET.
Another is that the year 1982 was the very beginning of peak 80s when Reagan was beginning to turn things around and pop culture was beginning to shake off the cynicism of the 70s. The zeitgeist simply wasn’t there to support a bleak film with one of the all-time great hanger endings..

        FYI, Sanders and Angus King are introducing legislation to ban drug ads from all media: TV, radio, streaming, print, digital.If that happens both streamers and Cable and OTA networks die quickly. Drug ads are at least 13% of all advertising spending on “linear” (i.e. non streaming) on TV. RFK Jr. wants to ban them, and it would hurt all the networks going in on Orange Man Bad.One other thing of note. TV traditionally had both pilot season (from Jan to April) where hundreds of scripts would be winnowed to about 30 pilots, of which only 10 would go into production for the fall or mid-season (January) replacements per network. A former co-worker had a gig at Nielsen, his main task was data conversion and pushing to analytics of the pilots to see Z scores and Rankings for both the shows as a whole and various characters. Networks had hours to fill, as the former CBC Network Exec Paul Chato noted, the network heads don’t keep their jobs running a test pattern. A show that tested well but had a problematic character would be reworked. Example, the Pilot for the A-Team, the original actor was replaced by Battlestar Galactica vet Dirk Benedict who was perfect for the role. [You can see on YT the pilot for yourself]. It worked the other way too — an actor/character that people liked but not the rest of the cast might have the entire cast replaced around him.The season was not filmed all at once, without a pilot, the way streamers do it now. Instead audience feedback from Nielsen ratings and detailed breakdowns of characters and such would allow studios to retool the show on the fly. Example: Happy Days went from starring Ron Howard and his pals to Henry Winkler because people liked Fonzie. Good Times went from Esther Rolle and John Amos starring to Jimmie Walker because even though he had no real acting experience people found him “DynoMite!” funny. To Rolle’s and Amos’s “serious Broadway actor” resentment.Midseason replacements would come in, and sometimes become hits. A network executive was only as successful as his relationships with show creators and show runners making shows people broadly liked allowed him to become. Since there was so much of this stuff being filmed, it brought in new people: actors, writers, producers, etc. constantly and kept film studios in the black even if the show ran somewhere else.Now, many streamers (Apple, Amazon, Disney) don’t care about their streaming success as their core business is other places and they could cut off streaming tomorrow with little consequence. Apple or Amazon or Disney don’t care if anyone watches their stuff, they place an order costing enormous amounts of money (Andor cost $300 million a season for its two season run of about 12 episodes per season). They film all at once so they cannot adjust: the audience really likes this character, have more of him, they hate this one, have less. Meanwhile “Gunsmoke” that ended production in 1975, moved into the top 10 of streaming last month, running on Paramount + and Peacock combined for its episodes.Now all the competent older White guys have been shoved out of writing, show running, and acting in favor of strong diverse women. And the new guys never got hired. No wonder you get “the Acolyte” or “Ironheart” or “She Hulk.”Lets hope Trump can take the win from Bernie and pressure Congress to outlaw drug ads. The sooner Hollywood collapses the better.

        Contemporary movies and TV drama shows are set up to break the cardinal rule of good/great storytelling – they “tell” rather than “show”.  Watch for 5 minutes and you know how the story end.

        Somewhat OT, Alex Padilla got himself arrested by rushing Kristi Noem during her LA press conference. This is wild.First, Padilla was dressed like casual Friday. Not as a distinguished Senator. Second, its Alex Padilla. He was known for being invisible. He’d been absent from the Senate all week, and now he pulls this stunt. I had completely forgotten he was a Senator, compared to Camera Hog Adam Schiff, Pencil Neck Geek (tm Classy Freddie Blassie) this guy might as well be the invisble man. My guess is this guy saw all the adulatory press that Newsom and Bass were getting and figured he better Fight the Orange Man for Carny Theater. Its telling that this is Alex Padilla. The meme about him in California is that he fades into the shrubbery like Homer Simpson in that episode.Maybe he saw Katy Perry demanding we turn over California to Mexico? All this LARPing is not going to end well for anyone.

        The reason the people of Hollywood, (and porn and vice themed gaming) are in trouble, and they are in serious trouble, is they have always detached themselves from the society in which they live. They want all the benefits of the host, including to run the entire thing, but to remain forever separate from it.Alas, the organism that behaves this way in nature is well understood. However, the highest IQs in the world cannot by self-awareness and introspection. This is particularly true of psychopaths who must maintain a strong self delusion of moral superiority and self righteousness in order to avoid confronting their monstrous behavior and its consequences.And so, Hollywood whether it survives or dies, will in the end be seen for what it always really was, a very subtle and clever means to infect the most important organ of the hosts – their minds and their moral center. Once all true morality has been consumed then all bets are off and chaos reigns. Can the organism maintain its place in the shadows, or did TCP/IP and durable storage along with infinitely cheap bandwidth make it so that all confessions and moments are permanently visible to an ever widening number of people who were the victims of very sophisticated psychological attacks? The early returns are that the, ‘we must destroy Europe so that it survives’, masked as a Westerner types cannot play whack-a-mole fast enough.Academic Agent’s latest read and his coverage of it is quite a moment of hubris that may turn out to be very difficult to bury and prevent from spreading across the great network designed for optimum resilience to attack.Spread this to every last person you know. Heck, order the book for everyone as a Christmas Gift:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jwLSQaRP60https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Peacemakers-Community-Relations-Service/dp/0826222161

        I’ll be off topic.  Among my many part time jobs when I was young were selling tickets and working in a concession stand in  high school — making popcorn and cleaning the machine was a greasy mess.  I got a part time job in Italy later as the projectionist by leveraging having figured out how school film projectors worked when we had a particularly clueless substitute teacher who couldn’t.    Anyway, I got to see movies for free.  We had kid matinees there too which were pretty amusing.  The biggest difference from the US was that smoking was allowed. I didn’t smoke much, but I always thought it was pretty funny. That was in the 80s and I had never seen saw people smoking in American theaters, except maybe in the balcony.Haven’t been to a movie in the last decade since moving from LA.  In my LA neighborhood there were a fair number of film people and I amused folks and embarrassed myself regularly by exhibiting great ignorance of contemporary film and television. I think about getting a streaming service just to watch some of the movies I hear about on to this site, and maybe a few others that former neighbors and acquaintances had credits for.

            I used to patronize the book stores when moved  to LA for a defense industry job. I was once drawn into a vigorous literary discussion with Brian Dennehy and John Larroquette. I eas always bumping into celebs, and it was fun at.the time.

        There was a blog, I forgot who ran it, back in the mid 2000s that argued that the main problem with Hollywood was lack of ownership. That it was not just the money (though that mattered) but the ownership. That the managerialism that infects Hollywood (Disney CEO Bob Iger owns only a few million in Disney stock and options as does the board) makes them not “owners” determined to create both wealth and a legacy, but short-termers looking to maximize their hard-left social network.No one in Hollywood cares about money, just getting paid. In that if a project loses money, it does not hurt careers. Sending the wrong message ala Todd Philips with “Joker” certainly does. Since the only money people will see is the initial check (James Garner reportedly got no residuals at all for the Rockford Files) there is no incentive to treat the project as anything but a rental car. While pushing the message gets acclaim in the press and the next job.Hollywood knows, and has known for decades (since the 1990s) what makes a movie or TV series successful and what makes it a failure. A strong male lead, preferably White, that women desire and men look up to, played by a competent actor, with good character actors in the supporting cast. That’s been a winner since 1939’s Stagecoach with John Wayne. Amazon was told by toy companies to include a strong White male lead in Rangz of Power, but Jennifer Sulke who ran the Entertainment Division didn’t care. She wanted her Strong Female Character.Hollywood knew destroying physical media would hurt their bottom line, as would destroying movie releases, as would Streaming. They did it anyway because Blackrock, Vanguard, State Street etc. will always pump more money in to them, they also have theme parks which are cash cows, and the studios are just rental cars. Look at Disney: they know Star Wars is a dumpster fire bleeding cash, yet they cannot fire Kathleen Kennedy and all her ilk and give it to someone like Tarantino to run. Same with Marvel: flop after girl boss flop after girl boss flop. Pedro Pascal, not only light in his loafers but weird (stealing female costars clothes and wearing them) is their male hero deliberately overshadowed by Vanessa Kirby who is not even really all that attractive or charismatic and is pushing 40. But Feige is untouchable as is the Girl Bossery which they know is a failure.And the key is that this is our opportunity to shape the culture. Yes films cost a lot, but you’d be surprised at what various YT dudes do on a shoestring budget with drones. There are a couple of guys in SoCal who really liked the late Huell Howser (KCET personality / producer who did long form shows on various interesting and historical places in California like the Channel Islands, the mud volcano in the Salton Sea, etc) and do various spins: Sidetrack Adventures, DJ Petesake. One does historical stuff and the other is a transit nerd. There is a guy in Canada (Steve Wallis) who does videos on camping that gets millions of views. Some are straightforward camping videos and others “stealth camping” aka homeless training. The challenge is getting noticed in a giant sea of slop. But it is possible. It is like Western Europe after the Legions left. It is not as if there is any serious challenge.

        Interesting timing of this essay. A friend of mine was telling me yesterday that they are re-releasing older movies back into the theater for limited engagements.

        “for get-togethers with friends to have a good time laughing at a bad film”For my family, this is a Friday night movie night category as we decide what to watch over pizza. Comedy, bang-bang, unrelatable indie, and mockable. Our entire voyage through the Rebel Moon movies set sail on the premise of them being hilariously bad and very predictable. And man were we right! Those are very mock worthy garbage and we looked forward as a family to the next release because the watch parties were a lot of fun.Social cohesion isn’t coming back until every corporate executive and every government bureaucrat is hung from every tree in America. And then AI solves our “social media” problem by releasing viruses into platforms like Twitter and Fakebook that obliterate them and the server farms down to their source code and os’s.If AI plays out logically, it’ll try to destroy those things.
