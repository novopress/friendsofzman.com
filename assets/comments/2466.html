        You say the answer is localism, I say the answer is less government—at all levels.  In the television and now the global Internet age, we tend to nationalize everything, our culture, our politics, our problems.  But even local politics can be corrupted by well organized self-interest groups.  The antidote is to reduce the scope of government intrusion into our lives; we need to ensure there are less spoils for the political pressure groups to fight over.  When a candidate proudly tells me he is running for office “to do something,” I cross him right off my list.  I’ve had enough of the crusading types, especially the LIBERAL kind. I don’t want my elected officials to do SOMETHING, I want them to do NOTHING.  I can handle the “doing,” whatever it is, by myself as long as I’m left alone.

        From the Testament of Tocqueville-The health of a democratic society may be measured by the quality of functions performed by private citizens. It really is difficult to imagine how people who have entirely given up managing their own affairs could make a wise choice of those who are to do that for them. One should never expect a liberal, energetic, and wise government to originate in the votes of a people of servants.Men’s taste for freedom and equality are, in effect, two different things and I am not afraid to add that in democratic nations they are also unequal. Freedom has revealed itself to men at different times and beneath different forms; it has not been exclusively bound to one social state and it makes its appearance elsewhere than in democracies. Thus it cannot possibly be taken as the distinctive characteristic of democracies.Democratic communities have a natural taste for freedom, but for equality their passion is ardent, insatiable, incessant, and invincible: they call for equality in freedom; and if they cannot obtain that, they still call for equality in slavery. Philosophic systems that destroy human individuality will have secret attractions for men who live in a democracy. They derive consolation from being supervised by thinking that they have chosen their supervisors.Men are much alike, and they are annoyed, as it were, by any deviation from that likeness; far from seeking to preserve their own distinguishing singularities, they endeavor to shake them off in order to identify themselves with the general mass of the people, which is the sole representative of right and of might in their eyes.It is believed by some that modern society will be always changing its aspect; for myself, I fear that it will ultimately be too invariably fixed in the same institutions, the same prejudices, the same manners, so that mankind will be stopped and circumscribed; that the mind will swing backwards and forwards forever without begetting fresh ideas; that man will waste his strength in bootless and solitary trifling, and, though in continual motion, that humanity will cease to advance.There are some people in France who regard republican institutions as the fleeting means to achieve greatness. They scrutinize the immense gap separating their defects and suffering from power and wealth and they would like to pile ruins into this abyss in an attempt to fill it.

        Your blatant localism is refreshing and this mini-assault on democracy is certainly very welcome.  Long live the Republic.

        Democracy.That’s where “We the people…” vote in the majority, and “suddenly” there’s a bunch of cash available to take it to the “right” judge and have it deemed null and void, if not the exact opposite of “the way it’s gonna’ be…”.Cali. Prop 8 comes to mind, but is CERTAINLY not alone.
