        The Ukraine is a sideshow. I can’t wait till Iran gets the bomb and the Joos are eliminated. Maybe another Nobel for Obama?

        “Victoria Nuland should have been publicly sacked so as to show the World Obama is not going to tolerate that sort of bungling.”
I think that the Neocons are the USG ‘Deep State’, there is no other explanation for why Nuland and the Kagan family still holds so much influence.

            I always thought the hysteria over Chuck Hagel by the warmongers was all about the fact he was right about Iraq. Hagel had his own defects, but he was first viewed as a traitor by the warmongers. he refused to go along with the war party. When it turned out he was right about Iraq, the warmongers never forgave him.American finds itself in the same spot the Romans found themselves in the Flavian Dynasty. Rome was predicated on constant expansion of the empire, but they had reached the point of diminishing returns. The expansionists could not accept and the realist struggled to find a way to square reality with Roman mythology. In America, the war party thinks the whole world can and should be democratized. The “isolationists” think that’s nuts, but they can’t put it in universalist terms.

        Right now apologize to nitwits.  Obama can’t begin to compete on the world stage because other countries have real leaders for better or for worse. They have beards and knives and that is just the women.  They see him for the weak boy-child that he is and every time he gives a speech I’m sure their translators go ” WTF, did he say that”?  Here, back home in the Amerighetto the press and lackys drool and fawn over him because ghey/racism/freebies.  That don’t play on the big stage.
