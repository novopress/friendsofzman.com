Indeed. I think spell checkers have become as much a nuisance as a help.

        The activists have to create a “hierarchy of intent”, (where they try to out-motive each other) because, well, they certainly can’t create a hierarchy of accomplishment, now, can they?

        The NYT is very deferential to their SWPL demographic, who like most hipsters don;t believe in concepts like racial differences

        Coates and Bouie are what I would call “nerd naggers” because their job of course is to nag nerds. To nag nerds you have to show you are one of them, because nerds learn to tune out non-nerds early in adolescence. So Coates writes a lot about comic books, and Bouie I don’t know because I never read him but his picture shows he’s a nerd. They aren’t really lower sorts or talents than their fellow writers because all these people are inconsequential losers or they wouldn’t be doing what they are doing.

            I call these guys ornaments. Progressive whites like to decorate their stuff with some diversity just to keep up appearances. Coates strikes me as a guy who maybe only suspects he is an ornament. Bouie seems to know it and just cashes the checks.
Coates is a real odd duck. I get the sense he is not emotionally stable.
