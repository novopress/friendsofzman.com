        Your post is mostly about Steve Sailer, but in the last paragraph, you say, “That’s why John Derbyshire’s argument does not work.”

        Re:  Dividing Lines, Right-Left, Up-Down
It was the genius of the Founding Fathers to create a UNION of sovereign states, each with their own parochial interests to manage mostly as they best saw fit, leaving the care of specific supra-regional issues to a weak central government. It is the persistent ignorance and arrogance of statist Democrats to dismiss that brilliant architecture in their attempts to forge a powerful nation-state in the image of long-failed European empires.

        “Maybe that’s the future, but in a feminized and timid culture, it is not the way to bet. Instead, everyone will voluntarily submit to an increasingly authoritarian custodial state.”
You are a wise man, which at this time has the same reward as the man who does a good turn when nobody is looking.

        A small point from the UK: our split between north/south (I am mostly here including the north of England with Scotland, against London and the ‘home counties’ around the capital) is one of opportunity, income and attitude.London has far more money, gets far more spent on infrastructure and decoration. It rules at the grace of Brussels and speaks for itself first. Consequently the south of the UK see itself as special, being the ‘decision-makers’ for everyone else. Actually, they are almost universally far less friendly and much more easily swayed by the excitable fashionable-issue crowd. Their giddy voice isn’t the voice of many others.That is the perceived issue in the UK, and one that spurs Scotland to seek independence among other things. ‘Southern softies’ are eager to give the wealth of the nation to others (some who are actively opposed to Britain and its traditional way of life), but not to those in its less affluent regions.The gap may be one of geography but it always comes down to attitude in the end.

        The divide can always be described as “us” and “them”.  Just jump into whatever group you desire or will have you.

        I think the real divisions in the US are ethnic/racial. The relevant groups would be at least:(1) the black underclass, especially Nation of Islam;(2) the Hispanic underclass (La Raza);(3) the white underclass;(4) American Indians;(5) the Amish;(6) orthodox Jews;(7) Somalis.There may be others. The important points is that these groups have a separate self identity that is more important to them than their American identity. They often speak a language different from English. They often reject the legitimacy of the federal, state and local governments and merely accede to superior force. They refuse to assimilate and do so knowingly.The black underclass is especially vehement in rejecting the legitimacy of white upper middle class culture and norms. But the other groups are rejectionist to one extent or another, too. Even underclass whites as indicated by the prevalence of Confederate battle flags, a rejectionist symbol.Since many of these groups are also regionally organized into compact, homogeneous areas, the potential for actual secession is real. The black underclass is dispersed among different cities, but within those cities there is no federal or state rule.However, I think that as in the Austro-Hungarian Empire it would require some sort of collapse of the center to be realized.

            Bob, I think of it this way. Take a bunch of people of various backgrounds and put them in a room. Barak Obama and Eric Holder walk in and are asked to pick out a group to talk with about their favorite subject. They are not strolling up to the homies in ghetto gear. They are not talking to the guy wearing a Dale Jr. shirt. They are gravitating to the guys in the J. Press golf shirts.The guy in the Dale shirt could own a string family restaurants in Ohio and be worth a million bucks while the golf shirt guys are front line attorneys for a second tier law firm. The Blue-Gray line transcends race, class, geography and income.
