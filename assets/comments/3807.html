        I had the same thing happen with a rental car. I had to turn bluetooth on to try it. It syncs with my iTunes and also the contacts on my phone. So, when I wanted to call my boyfriend, I could pick his name off the list. It was an interesting experience. And I cleared my phone (and all the others) off the car before I turned it in.If you owned the car, it would be handy, especially if you are on the road a lot. And it makes it less likely that people will get distracted by their phones. I suspect that most young people don’t have an expectation of privacy any way.

            I’ve had mobile phones since the days when they came in a leather tote bag. Hands free phones are the best for obvious reasons, but talking on the phone while driving is never a great idea. Our ability to concentrate while talking on the phone is much lower than even talking to passengers while driving. We need to use more of our brain on the phone than in person. Still, having the phone networked with the car is a nice feature until it gets abused, which it surely will.http://freebeacon.com/issues/feds-america-should-adopt-plant-based-diet/In Britain, the state is installing cameras inside the homes of parents with troublesome kids. We’ll be doing it in America soon enough. Except it will be Google or Apple, instead of Big Brother.

        That’s the same conference where William Binney, a former intelligence official, also spoke.Here is how he puts it, paraphrased excerpt from:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxnp2Sz59p8“We were coming into conflict with what I refer to as ‘feasting’ by the corporations that were leeches on the side of NSA and other agencies of the government, the ‘military industrial happiness management complex’. They were keeping each other happy: officials would retire from government, go to work for those corporations, the corporations would send people in to manage the programs, they’d get the contracts back and they’d feed some more.It’s a circle, it just keeps going round. The entire leadership at NSA was focused this way and they wanted no creativity, no innovation, no problem solved, “keep the problem going so the money keeps flowing” that was their vision statement, I just didn’t realize it.They didn’t want success, because that means you solved the problem, which they need to ask for more money to feed the corporations.”The same self serving “modus operandi” as seen in the war on drugs, poverty &amp; terror, keep it goin’ so the money keeps flowin’!

        Here is a private investigator talking about the state of privacy at the 2014 “Hackers on Planet Earth” conference:

Very interesting, directly from the horses mouth as they say…The message is essentially privacy is dead, get over it.
