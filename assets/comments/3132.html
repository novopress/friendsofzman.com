        […] great phrase I came across browsing through the archives of a new must-read, the Z Man.  The post in question is about the UNC cheating scandal, which you probably […]

        On academic matters, at most universities the faculty are charged with policing themselves, but when both the faculty and administration are corrupted, it becomes the job of the school’s Board of Regents to step in and lower the hammer.  Unfortunately, too many regents are political appointees who wish to avoid public embarrassment for themselves, the institution, and the politicians who appointed both them and the guilty-as-charged leaders of the school.  Too many waves and someone drowns.  Especially not good in an election year if the stench reaches deep into the governor’s office.

        Well, I worked my way through UNC in the 80’s and there were semi-covert lists of crip (not the gangsta kind) courses floating around while AA studies were always on the list the “Women’s studies” ones were prominently marked “no men!”
By the time I got out the AA/extension course scam was well known. Unfortunately I’d used my maximum of 40 hours on the other social distributions (Soci, Psych, Anthro) and couldn’t score an easy A.
And the AA “crip” in class courses required a hearty stomach if you were not of color, so I skipped that.

        If I don’t look at what’s going on, other than asking for reassurances that everything is going just fine, I don’t need to know anything bad. I can’t be blamed if I don’t know and anyway, I can reassure myself ‘there are procedures in place to deal with matters like this.’ If I don’t ask then the procedures need not be troubled.In my heart I suspect these so-called procedures are tissue thin and full of holes, but no one asks so no one needs to worry. There was a memo circulated about this, so I can now safely take the money and keep my head down and hope to get to retirement without any sh*t-storm spoiling my pointless existence.I am a conscientious and hard-working leader and on my watch, everything is wonderful and the future for me is secure.

        Did you read the latest Sailer article on Obama? I’ve read the Angelo Codevilla analysis on him almost four years ago and is similar to Sailer points, the conclusion is that Obama is a CIA brat, a accidental “Manchurian Candidate”.

        Plausible deniability. If you do not look, you cannot find. This is how our country is “ruled” today. A blind eye, heads in the sand, pretending the rule of law still stands. And this is one small episode.  Impending crises are nibbling at the margins of our collective psyche. Can you feel the unease?
