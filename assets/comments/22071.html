        What’s beyond the black pill? I’ve come out on the other side, gone through all the Kubler-Ross, emerged with eerie Zenlike calm, because I’ve realized: people want this. For every fraudulent Biden vote, there was a real Biden vote, because universal prosperity is a blind alley of human evolution. Homo twitterus. Now I know his the Neanderthals felt.

                One of the many reasons I retired from the professing biz was that I no longer saw the point. I loved teaching. I was one of those stereotypes who felt like it was almost a calling. If I could just reach *one* student… But one can only act like King Canute for so long. My blood pressure couldn’t take it anymore. Trust me: the 2020 graduating class *loves* Big Brother.

                    Teaching IS a holy profession. Unfortunately, the left has turned teaching into factory work where the end product is indoctrinated morons.

                Strangely enough, European descendants with Neaderthal gene markers overwhelmingly draw their Neanderthal genes from male Neanderthal/female homosapien couplings.
I guess there were a lot of fat ugly cromagnon chicks acting as baby-momma for Tay-Grok.

Unlikely. She was left to fend for herself or live on charity from the rest of the homosapien tribe. You see, Tay-Grok wasn’t bout to marry and get saddled wit providing bison meat for some kid he was pretty sure actually belonged to Jamal-Narg. And unfortunately, Jamal-Narg got shanked two seasons ago while doing a stretch up in Pangaea for a home-cave invasion.

        It’s simple: TPTB have no ability to run the show. They’re very good at taking advantage of an existing community’s social trust for profit, but they can’t maintain communities (except their own parasitic community).Modern technology has allowed a concentration of power not possible before. No king in the middle ages could watch everyone. No banker could control cut themselves in on every deal. Society was just too diffuse.But computers, television, the internet, etc., allow a very small number of people to control society. The problem is that this small group has no ability nor desire to maintain or, heaven forbid, improve the community. They only know how to leech off of it.They will maintain their power in the short run first by propaganda  and then by more hard power. But it won’t work. They’ll fail. Communities require social trust, and social trust can only be built and maintained by people who share a common heritage and culture and who feel a part of the community as a whole.Whites still feel this about our society even though that ship sailed long ago. And Whites are the only thing holding this society together. As Whites fall in power and numbers, so too will society. If Whites also start to wake up to their reality, society will fall even faster.Nothing can hold this society together because it relies on Whites acting as dopes. This can’t last either because they’ll start to run out of dopey Whites or Whites stop acting like dopes. No amount of smart phone propaganda can stop that.

                This will be even faster. Think Rhodesia, not Russia. TPTB would like to stop Rhodesia from becoming Zimbabwe because, well, Rhodesia was a lot nicer and richer. Unfortunately, the mercenaries that they brought in to defeat us have other ideas.

                    Goodwhites belief is like this:

The entire world of people is interchangeable, except with better cuisine. EXCEPT for European- descended whites, especially Christians, who are not Goodwhites. These people are evil and irredeemable. And they eat bland food.

It’s nonsensical. And that’s why their society will fail, because people are not interchangeable. Unfortunately everything nice will be destroyed in the process, and we might even be destroyed with them.

                        I call that the “LEGO brick theory”. That people, regardless of race, religion etc. can be snapped together like a LEGO brick to build any society desired.

            Yeah, I was just thinking the other day how goodwhite behaviors are only possible in a society maintained by badwhites.A strong wammin on the carousel in a big city… well it’s only possible when other hard working white men are holding society up. There are not many power women in Detroit, for instance.The whites at work break their back to keep things running… the non whites just shrug and pass whatever’s not done at the end of the day onto the white people. White people are suckers. But yeah, society is going to collapse because a) some white guys like myself have figured things out and b) we are a shrinking minority anyways.

                Yep, the speed and manner that this society fails is unknowable. Could take decades or longer. Is our future Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, Rhodesia or something else? Who knows.But the direction is assured so long as Whites keep falling as a percent of the population. Third world immigration and birthrates will cement the decline for the society as a whole, though your situation could be very different from the general fall.I think that Z is right. We’re probably looking at something like Spain at the end of the Roman Empire. State control will wain and individual areas will slowly take over more of the day to day running of things. Those areas could be very different from one another.

        I’ve resolved myself to being a slave; but I also think of myself as a wily peasant. This state of mind takes one away from any thought of being on top—or being frustrated when you figure out your effort within the system doesn’t get you to the brass ring. Let someone else chase credentials.Many of us white guys are smarter than average and perfectly capable to do just fine. You just need to quit negotiating with a rigged system and use your brain given the nasty circumstances. In my opinion this starts with doing the math of putting your labor through the W-2 system versus doing something else. I have the attitude that a few acres of cheap land in a rural area is a better deal. Make some stuff (meat and fermented products are always in demand), barter it where your labor isn’t skimmed, and at the same build a community through trading. Real labor eliminates all the fake labor supervisors in the HR office at the cube farm and you sleep better at night away from the grifters.

            i would advise young people to stay out of college (at least the four year kind) and go into one of the trades.  make more money, and more opportunities for off the books graft.  also, that kind of work can’t be sent overseas…

                But even around here those guys get undercut by by cheap, unlicensed imported labor.  Though on the positive side, a friend that owns a plumbing firm, does a good (and increasing) portion of his business cleaning up after the work of unlicensed, illegal contractors hired on the cheap.  Often when the house is going to be sold and the home inspector hired by the buyer finds all sorts of non-code compliant hack work that he won’t pass.

                    And the trades are now being undercut by the Empire of COVID.I have a relative who thought he was taking care of his future by going to welding school.  But he has been furloughed because there is no demand for the school buses he works on.

                            Its not really a joke. This may be your reality in a few months.You also might get your chemist friends to help you figure out a way around the ammo shortage too. Do it the legal way for now but once things go hot, laws are meaningless.

                            Back in the Gulf War this was called Hillbilly Armor and was used on US think skinned vehicles too.It might not be of much help though. The weapon of choice right now is the bomb drone, half a kilo of explosives on a drone makes mince meat out of most vehicles including armored cars which have thin tops.The Armenians learned this last month when the Azerbaijanis deployed these things an inflicted in a couple of months  more casualties than the entire USSR took in a decade of Afghan war.Drones aren’t super hard to make though so your smart machinist friends can learn to make crude ones with a payload just in case. Nice and legal  socially distant delivery for the nonce of course.If you haven’t see it,  go seeSlaughterbots.That tech is about ten , fifteen years out and smart people can make cruder forms now.Think thisTHEY sent A SLAMHOUND on Turner’s trail in New Delhi, slotted it to his pheromones and the color of his hair. It caught up with him on a street called Chandni Chauk and came scrambling for his rented BMW through a forest of bare brown legs and pedicab tires. Its core was a kilogram of recrystallized hexogene and flaked TNT.He didn’t see it coming.See also the Lock On’s from RunawayMake sure that tech however crude is on your side. Its a huge force multiplier allowing whoever controls it to act remotely.No need for thrilling heroics

                    That’s another eternal problem Zman didn’t really address – it’s not merely the global capitalists who want cheaper labor, it’s western Whites in general.  That’s why capable White tradesmen are so few and so dear, and why Pablo not only cuts the grass but ‘repairs’ the cars and ‘builds’ the houses, which are designed and made to decay with 5-10 years.  We need to learn to provide value for quality White service and think communally, not just of our own wallet.

                        Seeing a bit of the underbelly, capable white tradesmen tend to get snapped up by higher paying salaried jobs for developers and huge construction firms rather than stay on the line.  Why fight tooth and nail in the cold and wind for 100-300k a year, when you can sit at a desk for $125k salary with benes for GloboDevCo?

                        Cheap labor has been a national obsession since the founding fathers day. Hell we had the military bombing people back in 1909 because they struck wanting  better pay and benefits.If you are hoping for a small state, if you win forget it.Its going to require a lot of work and a large state  to break people of that habit and even with that, a lot of hard labor sentences and firing squads along with a hermetically sealed border till the message is  clear.Our Social Conservatives got gulled into thinking that economics and morality  weren’t related.They really are and as distasteful as it is to admit the Communists are correct in that a new morality has to include the way we relate economically to others. In other words, business regulation must also be moral regulation.

                    Our side ought to consider holding people who hired illegals over citizens or encourage mass migration of cheap labor as enemies of the new State. I leave solutions to your imaginationAnd I do  mean that past tense, its not like the other guys wouldn’t screw Ex Post Facto, we should too if only because such people will never be good citizens and will always be ready to sell out neighbors for a pittance.

        The system that is emerging is explicitly free of any moral duty to society, as it rejects the very notion of society.Yes, a strange one this. No moral duty to society as measured by actions, say: building houses for workers, encouraging family development etc. But the proponents of the system are indeed moral people – they signal their moral virtue in every dimension possible. Like everything in our modern age, style over substance has reached – and I think will continue to reach – ever greater heights.Put simply, we now have population that loves to invite government into it’s business. But, as the old adage goes: If you expect the government to wipe your arse, don’t be surprised when it starts jerking you off, too. Apologies for vulgarity, but you get the point.

            I dunno Orange Frog. Global Corp Inc. buys your politicians. Said politicians then extract your output and redirect it to housing, EBT, employment set asides and preferred access to academia for Shenequa and Guadalupe’s offspring. Then Mega-Corp and Media-Corp force feed you diversity ads and programming like you are a goose being prepared for foie gras.
They have their moral obligations… they just dont involve you or your family at all.

        In a society where we’re a plurality among minorities (probably headed toward minority status too, and faster than any official calculations estimate), any power we’ll have will basically be like that of Chechen clans or Afghani warlords, which is to say we can be a thorn in the side of our rulers to the point where they’re forced to withdraw, go around us, or make concessions to go through our territories. We’ll have a much harder row to hoe than some goatherds, though, as most of us lack basic skills (the worship of college here in the Anglosphere really hobbled us), and we also have a government which will once again be given free hand to send out settlers from the inner city to pacify our settlements and act as commissars and spies and damage our social capital (it’s hard to focus on anything productive when you have to worry about your kid getting his face mauled off by some ghetto pitbull every time he rides his bike). And Biden (who just broke his ankle playing fetch with his dog) will soon be replaced by Kamala, who will probably do this even faster than Obama did. HUD is basically going to be our Bureau of Indian Affairs, and we’re going to be getting a big bundle of blankets here soon. At least Sackler, the makers of the firewater, were recently punished in court.

            We’ll have a much harder row to hoe than some goatherds, though, as most of us lack basic skills (the worship of college here in the Anglosphere really hobbled us),Still. If it spares me from diversity and it’s hateful, slothful, vengeful commissars, I wouldn’t mind. Each day brings a new realization of the daftness of unrestrained modernity. I think I’d happily give up a lot of these ‘benefits’ that make me far more reliant on a centralized system in order for a break away from diversi-tyrants. Don’t mind being governed by a warlord (within reason), as long as he’s got my back I’ll pay tribute.

                Not to shill for anyone, but you may be interested in John Mosby of Mountain Guerilla. He discusses beating the rush and collapsing now, as well as the importance of building our tribes of choice.  He is behind patreon now, but his old blog is still up and a wealth of free info.  Worth reading as it relates to our likely future.

            It wouldn’t surprise me if we’re already minorities… well aside from the Boomers and Silents we are.
This is exacerbated by the fact that urban white liberals under 40 have basically stopped having kids. I know a Boomer lib couple with 4 kids – none of them have kids and the eldest daughter is like 36 now and not married.
Unfortunately when all of society has gone crazy there’s not much you can do individually… just have families and create networks of trusted people, and throw sand in the gears of the system in any way possible.

                        Lotsa proud boomer fathers left to enjoy the sunset with their grandpets.The elimination of moral duty to society at the most fundamental level was to subordinate creating more of that society to that of corporate service.Credentials over children. Building brands over building families.On the individual level, the fruit of the tree of progress promised boundless opportunities and freedom from moral duty to society; humility in favor of pride and status; self-actualization over grace.In globocorp society this means serving a husband is low status; serving a higher-ranking man in corporate office, however, is high status.Parents encouraged this path. Better to be self-sufficient than to be left at the mercy of a man’s ability to earn his keep.So the pretty lies of progress obscured the ruthlessness of trading naked options with nature. The wall indeed.Lawyerbishes bloomed and family formation wilted.Courtship became a social credit application; marriage a corporate merger. Children are liabilities but like good credit, one card is high status, three is prolish irresponsibility. Besides, there is plenty of time for that later.All the liberation, all the pride, is just a prison where credentialed inmates search for love through an app on their phones between competitions with those same men for status.The same men who couldn’t be trusted with their futures twenty years ago because equality or something.Instead of a wide open future with her people it is a narrowing path toward isolation and loneliness. Self-sufficiency is now wage-slavery. The alternative is to go backward, something the religion of progress forbids. They press on.Prying some away from the machine to embrace backward badwhiteness is a tall order. I tried for years. The only way is to build young men up – and away from the soul-harvesting combine of progress and pride.In defense of it all, French bulldogs do kind of look like babies.

                    Yeah that’s the thing – most of these single ladies will never sniff a management job. They bounce around from entry level job to entry level job. Which makes their excuse for not having a family all the flimsier.I’m in my early 30s and yeah, it’s pretty bleak out there even if you are physically fit and earn six figures. These ladies have been taught that something better is always going to come along…until it doesn’t and it often doesn’t.A coworker’s daughter had a mental breakdown recently when she found out she couldn’t have kids. She was beautiful and is now in her late 30s and simply waited too long.I’m guessing there’s a lot more going on like this than we realize. Even though female journalists like to share everything about their lives and are obsessed with their genitals, this is a story they’re going to keep a lid on it until it’s too late for millennials as they enter middle age.

                        This.  Coworker from way back when had the exacy same thing, spent 10 years climbing partner track, only to find out mid-30’d she had low fertility.  Smart, attractive, somewhat traditional minded but wanted to chase the boomer path and now she’s an evolutionary dead end. At least she’s married and happy with her cats…

                Urban white liberals not having kids . . . That’s a good thing, if conservative young people take up the slack.  Unfortunately, the Fed’s assassination of the dollar has made it difficult financially to have a large family.

                    My son and daughter-in-law are anxious to have children.  It’s going to be financially very difficult for them, and we’re going to help in any way possible.  And the first way is NOT providing ‘free’ daycare so my daughter-in-law can go back to work – it will be to offer $ so SHE can stay home and be mother to her own children.  A few half days a week watching the child/ren to give her some free time would be fine,  but I don’t want to be mother to my grandchildren.  I want to be granny.

                        A poster somewhere here asked about another’s definition of social capital. You statement of intent is a great answer to it. Nowadays, even social capital within family units has eroded – it is always good to see people reviving it. Good for you and best of luck.

                        How you help your children depends on alot of things. My advice based on recent experience:Helps when grandparents are clear about what they are willing to contribute. My sister, friends and myself have been surprised (after babies arrive) at the limits of grandparents to help after years of them asking/begging us to have kids. Feels like a bait and switch.Its hard these days, especially on the coasts, for women to entirely drop career for kids. Takes two salaries to sustain a family here.Young people need to be realistic regarding career and child rearing trade offs. Earlier they think this through the better. Careers that require grad degrees, lengthy training, narrow specialization etc are especially bad for starting families. I advise people to study things/do things that let them get paid with no more than an undergrad degree. Teaching, nursing, comp sci, engineering, accounting make sense from this perspective.

                            My sister became an M.D. and did well financially, also had five children.  How did she do it? She got married, got pregnant, didn’t get an abortion, got pregnant again, etc. In real life doctors don’t get fired for getting pregnant. Kids are a lot of work but well worth it; this is true whether or not women have professional careers.

                                My experience with MD degrees is that its a risky prospect for alot of people due to time required to get through program, uncertainty with admissions (med school, then residency) and financing of degrees. All these uncertainties combine to delay decision to have kids for most.Timeline might look like: complete undergrad (graduate at 21). Typically people do something to buff resume for a few years before med school (average entrance age 24). Then four year med school (age 28). Then 3 to 7 year residency (age 31 to 35). I know women that didn’t have serious relationships (i.e., date around but no real commitment) prior to residency as the unknowns regarding living situation made it difficult for stable partner relationship. If woman starts dating partner in late 20s, early 30s, when will they have first kid and how many kids will they have?

                            Oh, she’s more than ready to stay at home – it’s just a question of how much we can contribute financially and how much my son can earn.  He just got a new job at significantly higher pay, so we’ll see if her ‘worrier’ personality helps them save more money than his ‘it will all work out’ spending personality.

                                @3g4me, small tips to consider. I have found child care (daycare) cost scales with rent in my city. If your son ends up grandchild in daycare, I would suggest looking for childcare in lower rent neighborhood. Can save some money that way… Also, get son to read or listen to Dave Ramsey. His approach to money management helped my wife out alot.

                                    There is no way in hell my son would put a child in daycare, particularly not in a low-rent neighborhood.  Why on earth would you want the lowest-paid people watching your progeny?  Our children never went to daycare (Mother’s Day Out starting at age 3, but that’s quite different) and they appreciate that their school day ended, whereas too many of their classmates, even at Christian school, had to remain for ‘after-school care’ until 6 or 7 PM.  We did without plenty of things for me to stay home and our sons to grow at home in our care, not that of minimum-wage strangers.The money management issue is out of my hands, but my daughter-in-law is more frugal than my son and already seems to have influenced him more than I can.  Dave Ramsey has some good ideas, and some that are ludicrously out of date (the cost to buy, operate, and repair a banged up car are far more than he seems to think).

                                        If your child is in daycare in my city, the people watching them are the same regardless of the neighborhood. You just pay alot more for this service where the rent is higher. Good people can be found anywhere, but it requires interviews and close attention.
What you suggest is ideal of course. I am suggesting alternatives if solutions that fall short of the ideal are necessary.

                        I appreciate the sentiments but you are completely wrong about not helping your family.

As a new father who lives several states away from all our family’s relatives, it’s a challenge to raise kids without help. This is a big reason why urban liberals who want to have kids, rare they are, don’t have many kids – they are often transplants and daycare is pricey.

Caring for infants is a challenge and humans evolved in clans/villages where childcare was a shared responsibility. You put your family at an evolutionary disadvantage and are likely lowering the number of your progeny.

                            I have no clue how you interpreted my comment to mean ‘not helping my family.’  I have cared for others’ infants since I was 12 years old, and know well how much love and care and work they require.  I fully expect to assist my son and daughter-in-law, but equally expect them to be the parents and primary caregivers. I will assist when asked and however possible, with the exception of watching the children myself full-time so she can return to work – that’s where gifting them $ comes in instead.

                    Not at all wrong but in modernity its opportunity costs as much as actual costs. You can have a large family if you want one but most anything beyond the very basics is not available.Oddly enough Reason Magazine got it correct for once “maybe people don’t have many kids because they don’t want them.”If you have many kids , you had best be the type of person who wants to bust his butt for them and gets his satisfaction there since all the nice things, trips, movies (in the past) new vehicles, expensive hobbies aren’t available for you. You work for the kids alone basically.Most people don’t do this but instead  White’s K selected strategy says have a couple of kids maybe three which most Right leaning people do and give them the best of everything.Ths is fine if immigration is managed, as humanity in the broad sense is grossly past its social and physical carrying capacity.What’s wrong is not “low fertility” but economic migration into White lands and ratios. A healthy European derived ratio is around 25% of the human race, maybe a bit more. If we drop by one or six billion people, it matters not so long as our lands are ours, and we stabilize at that ratio or better.In terms of economics, I’d suggest reading Leftist economic critiques  prior to critical race theory (CRT)  Nearly every critique has a degree of merit though few solutions they proffer are  workable.We will have to make productivity over finance  and working/middle wealth distributions a cornerstone of anything we do. If we fail to do this , we lose.That will not be simple, the money boys will need to be removed from any source of power and I fear they’d use China as a stalking horse to destroy upstarts and CRT/mass repatriation  as the Evils of Nazism pretext.It still remains an utter necessity though to give warning , it may not increase the  fertility rate  by much if at all. That if it happens at all may well  take a lot of time. This is about ratios and a foundation, not immediate results.

                        The poor get a lot of assistance in the developed world and even than don’t have as high a fertility as you think.Using African American as proxy for poor the US TFR is 1.9 . Its above White and Latino but below replacement.Ultimately if you cram people into cities, you must learn to live with  less babies.In order to change that you need large scale economic and social reforms and to move people into smaller homogeneous towns where they can be born, live and be buried without leaving unless they want to and society should discourage it,To do this  you must have  stable well remunerated work for all IQ levels , heavy nearly extreme controls on finance and lower housing costs among other things.Socially  you need to make sure marriage is stable and the status bump from  family formation is  worth than the opportunity costs.That isn’t easy and if it cannot be done, work on making sure the US is Whiter/Righter/Better with closed borders until the economy and social changes support stability.

                There are 8 boomer siblings between my husband and I. The various marriages produced 13 offspring. The offspring, save 1, are of childbearing age, with several in their 30s. There are 4 children between them (plus a trendy adoption – don’t ask). We might get 2 or 3 more out of the mix, but most of them can’t even find mates. Catastrophic.

                    Yeah its nuts, the urban white fertility is about 0.5, as you mentioned.
When you look at general white fertility it’s about 1.6 across the USA, which means somebody is picking up the slack. Lots of white trash, Christians, and rural people must be having kids because its certainly not happening in my circles either.

                        The bulk of US White fertility is rural and observant religious folks especially Amish who double every twenty years!Its not Church Evangelicals though , they no longer have retention.Now where I live cheap California. I see a fair number of White babies but overall the TFR is low for all races.I know a some faithful  LDS people who had   3 kids, oldest now 30 , youngest like 25, no grand kids A Latino lady  who went from being one of three with adult age kids and not wanting any, preferring her daughter have more “Free-dumb”Now this  is not new at all. While the Baby Boomers has a higher TFR than we do and overall fertility rate, they tanked it in 1973 going to 1.8 and and sans immigration never going above that. That near half a century of low fertility.An example I know, One Lost/Silent generation with 3  Boomer kids . Among those, three Gen X kids and among those zero grandchildren any generation.A fertile  number would have been 9 Gen X kids with 9 Kids Gen Y  each and 9 More Z kids (these were older Gen X)A healthy number would have been 6 or 7 Gen X, 7 or so Gen Y and 6 or 7 Gen Z kids,This loss is some parts economic,   cultural ,opportunity  costs, and partially the fact that modern life serves no purpose. You exist as a consumer in a dead culture atomized from history and tradition and faith,Apparently  consumers while good for the short and mid term bottom line stop having kids and in the long term result in social annihilation. Who’da Thunk?In the end if they aren’t annihilated, the faithful will prevail though and The Amish/Christian/Orthodox wars of 2200 will be lit!

                        Dumb people aren’t really having kids in the developed world either.The only exception is the first generation of immigrants which is why Rubio et all are pushing an amnesty. They have run out of suckers to keep the system afloat and they’d rather burn in hell than raise wages.Ultimately though big brains, the 140 type and their 120+ allies are risking all our lives  anyway. If its not AI, nukes, a microbe much worse than COVID, nano tech, bad vaccines or something else these assholes are endangering all of humanity and if it takes a bit of a dumber species to spare the species, so be it.As for your point, in any developed society being smart carries a heavy cost. Not only do children themselves cost time, money and opportunity to do other  things smart people are socially isolated from the rest of humanity.Anyone 2 or more std deviations above the mainstream is treated as some kind of monster. This amplifies the fact that smart people tend to have the wrong psychological traits for reproduction.I’m in that category myself and even my average level of conscientiousness is a hinderance since it means a low chance of accidental reproduction.If we really want a lot more smart people and this is really not a good idea, there are three ways to get it.#1 A cultural shift to arranged marriages between smart families. This is jarring but safe,#2 Genetic engineering ala GATTACA where fetuses are selected by intelligence markers and health. We obviously aren’t there yet but its doable,#3 State arranged marriages based on algorithmic selection with egg and sperm harvesting used when individuals do not cooperate. Such children would have to be had by surrogates and raised by either the surrogate or adopted families not state agencies in order to lower the risk of sociopaths.

                    Natural for an urban society.Fertility in the US dropped every year since industrialism charting roughly as the US got more urban. The big trigger was the Great Depression where we hit modern fertility levels and didn’t get high until the economic boom of the late 40’s and 50’sThis boom was the best economy the US ever had and dovetailed beautifully with the faux ruralization of the suburbs where you could spread out and have some kids. We got briefly as high as an average of four,It wasn’t sustainable, that economy was gone by 1973 and that culture with it.So you get a natural rate exacerbated by the computer age.

                Russians are hard men with a serious legit grudge against the Chechens.Baring robots or revolution by the time our society gets to that point, it will be well not up to the task of doing anything that serious do to it being used for virtue signalling not warfighting.In any case the Chechen people will still win the war over time. They have double digit population growth vs Russian population shrinkage,

        The New Yorker cover, roundly mocked by the right, is the future that the tech oligarchs want for us.  A middle aged woman without children sitting next to her computer in a dilapidated small apartment, food strewn everywhere, pills next to her keyboard, wine glass in hand, pretending to be happy.

            Looks like the present to me.
Downtown Toronto is full of attractive young women… they all look miserable and lonely, but on the surface they’re “happy” which is the only level most people can interpret others at.

                women are NEVER happy when young
It’s a facade
If God wanted them to be happy who wouldn’t make them bleed every month in pain
Brings to mind another lie. The female “orgasm”. If women had an orgasm like a man has they’d be screwing every moment of the day. The fact they don’t says it all.  Intense pleasure does not an orgasm make.

                    Odd but interesting topic.My understanding female orgasm can be so intense that Le Petit Morte , the little death which is essentially transitory  unconsciousness after orgasm is associated with women far more than men.As for the menses, there are birth control pills that deal with that specially  and according to Web MD for most women simply using active pill during the placebo week does the same. There are some risks though.Largely in this era its the presence of vibrators than end up desensitizing women that result in weaker orgasms. It also requires a bit more skill and effort for a woman to orgasm than a man and I suspect sometimes mechanical aid do to biology.As for reproduction itself, The most curious thing is that our human reproduction peak starts well below  our mental development peak.Humans  are “adults” mentally somewhere from  25  or 30  and this is well into a woman’s safe/efficacious reproduction yearsThis suggests to me that our evolved reproduction strategy was more animal than evolved and meant to pop out enough offering for species continuance before we really thought through what we were doing.This matches at least some history in that in urban medieval Europe, marriage wasn’t common till the mid 20’s which meant that during many eras birth rates could not keep up with death rates.It also suggest that if at some point we need to encourage higher fertility, not only will we need social change but economic as well.We need people to be able to marry and start a family younger . It won’t be easy, ignoring social issues opportunity costs and hypergamy , making wages go up for younger workers  is nigh impossible in the current system.

        As you’ve alluded to before, these elites increasingly live in insulated bubbles.  In the olden days, the evil rich factory owners, still lived in town, albeit the nice part.  Now they exist in completely separate enclaves with little or no contact with objects of their transactional desires.  Was going back through some old private equity data for a project–at that snapshot, 14.5k industrial companies were under PE ownership and mostly are traded back and forth between PE investors.  A “fix-it” focused firm buys a company, gets it running well and profitably, flips it to a “stripper” PE fund that takes the improved cash flow, levers it up, pays themselves large dividends until the firm is sucked dry, goes belly up and then gets “sold for salvage”, sometime with the remaining assets sold to another PE firm that specializes in bottom feeding. Impact on society a tertiary concern when everything is financialized.

                He still lived in an age of “connection”.  I know guys that work in all three categories.  The first is pretty rare.  Usually firms that specialize in a narrow industry sector and are very good at reviving stale companies.  But not many of them.  The middle category is the most dominant and it is pure financial engineering.  But the “destruction” they engineer is not of the natural causes type, but rather intentional homicide.

        There are many platforms which encourage/require their users to spend their ownsocial capital, ostensibly for their own benefit, but also for the benefit of the platform’s owners.DonorsChoose is one such place; it’s a place where teachers can post projects that they want funded, which the school system won’t fund. For example, an art teacher wants to give crayons and paper to the students but it’s not in the school’s budget. The teacher doesn’t want to spend their own hard earned cash, so they go begging to the general public by posting a funding request on DonorsChoose. The website will skim 25% of whatever you raise, and require you to buy from their vendor list. The Donors get to choose which projects they donate to; all donations are also anonymous.They encourage you to get your friends and family to donate, to use upyoursocial capital, so they can skim their bit. What a racket.

                It’s a lot more than just “trust”; it’s whether or not others are willing to help you out, lend you money, bail you out.  Or do they blow you off because you’re not worth it to them. Did you buy at their kid’s lemonade stand?? then they’ll help push your car when you’re stuck in the snow. Donate money towards your students’ supplies?  Did you spend hours listening to them bitch about their life?  Quid pro Quod.

                One really granular example.  Over the Thanksgiving holiday one my kids found a binder clip with a guys operating engineer and contractors licenses, his CCW and D/L in the house we were renting for the holiday. Turns out he was out on the island doing some work for the owners the week before.  Made sure tracked him down and took the time to FedEx back to him on the mainland–since clearly he was “one of our guys”.

                Social capital is the value people give you, as you,  based on what you have provided to the community to date.  Have you given your extra veggies from your garden to the community church pantry?  Donated your experience mentoring someone?  Helped out the neighbors by watching their place, changing their tire, cutting the old lady’s lawn, etc.  Leveraging whatever experience and abilities you have now to assist with no current expectation of return is how to bank that social capital for when you need it.

                We used to call in “chits” but better way is to this of it as “chips”
Call in your chips.  IOW favors owed.  You help Tom fix his car over the summer.  He owes you now.  At some point you cash in.  If he balks, you then say “remember the time I helped you with your car?  You owe me, don’t you think”  And he agrees.
Basically, being neighborly and friends.  And writ large society-wide

                        As another example of what you’re talking about, in the US after 9/11 you saw lots of “God Bless America” bumper stickers. This outraged the AWRs who responded with “God Bless All Nations” bumper stickers. The AWRs hate locally and love globally, which is moral perversion.

            ANY project that involves public schools will never get a penny from me.  All dissident rightists need to bear in mind that the public school population in the US is about 65% nonWhite, particularly elementary age children.  Don’t fund your replacements!  They’re not going hungry; they are grifters and idiot emotionally incontinent White women are the stooges who financially support them.

                        Lineman,
Have you looked into any condemned or even movable older buildings for a school house? Also, Mrs. Penitent has some good knowledge about which homeschooling programs (essentially services individuals purchase into like a charter). Some are great, and help parents coordinate learning for groups of homeschool families and create environments and schedules so the kids from different families can get together… and some are scams.

        We’re truly in the Age of Quicksand. Justice has been replaced with emotional oscillation, beauty sullied by vile ugliness, harmony shattered by discord and all of it is permeated by a sense of frantic fleetingness.I’m feeling a definite animus out there that nothing is concrete anymore, everything relative &amp; arbitrary. What was a safe bet yesterday will get you in trouble today, solutions that used to be effective are now risky, to say the least.And so…we vanish into the quicksand, sink into a quagmire of nihilism and horror. I think the order of the day is camouflage and diving deep. Staying in the game, I think, is currently the best that can be hoped for…

            We’re moving from a Western moral code to an Eastern one. The only pleasures to be had in the bazaar come from haggling and getting one over on the other guy. Since this isn’t something decent people enjoy, all our joys and pleasures will have to come far away from the madding agora where all these monsters thrive.

                        I’m all for compiling a roster of addresses right now.
I don’t know if anything like this happened where you live, but I know several people who got anonymous letters in the mail this year that basically said “Thank you for having a Trump sign in your yard.  We now know where the racists live.”  There’s no reason a similar letter couldn’t be sent to the COEXIST crowd.

                            My future dream job. Immigration officer for urban hordes trying to get away from their nightmare cityscapes. During the interview, as I question suspected woke whites trying to flee, I occasionally pinch the tech weenie assigned to me to bring up their “deleted” Facebook accounts and peruse their past posts. I can smell the nervous sweat emanating from them and hear the fearful wavering in their responses as they realize they aren’t going to make the cut. Back to Diversitopia for you my woke lad.

                                Penitent man, we share the same fantasy job!  Seriously, I’ve constructed so many similar scenarios in my mind, being visa interviewer for the White ethnostate or potential refugee sorter for a smaller enclave.  I developed a hardline reputation on the visa line in Jamaica and ended up with the applications most thoroughly coated in obeah (voodoo) powder.  Didn’t help them a bit.

                                I’m always open to arguments about the strategic value in attacking the other side, but this bed-wetting insistence  that we forever cede the field to our enemies really needs to stop.  Sooner or later we need to fight, even if it’s rear guard  action.

                    When they say they’re for kindness, it’s pure cynicism. It’s like saying you’re against kicking puppies. The whole goal is try to reframe their hideous ideology as just and kind.
Although “kindness” is now looked at more skeptically since Ellen DeGenerate liked using that word often and now she’s known as the total opposite. A very small silver lining is that the left has fewer tricks in their bag since a lot of their own words they like to use are tainted.

                Meaning don’t cross the new social lines, or politically correct dogma, publicly. Doing so can get you unpersoned, unemployed, and unemployable.

        I have been thinking that society’s borders are very important and  show up everywhere in these reciprocal duties and obligations. These serve to create barriers to a dissolution, that thing which happens when everyone wants the same thing.One example is the old idea that nobles cold only marry other nobles. It’s a barrier, yes. It reduces freedom, yes. We view it as unjust. But that barrier acted to prevent the local alphas from taking the best commoner women, which absent that prohibition, they could do whenever they wanted. The prohibition acted as a restraint on the nobles, and also on women’s hypergamy.When you dissolve all barriers including the most primitive distinctions between male or female, you create a mass of undifferentiated and seething humanity. The problems that creates are considerable and solved only with the most brutal and primitive mechanisms.

            That’s an important insight, the role that class divisions have in constraining hypergamy.  Haven’t heard that angle before, kudos.

        At the end of the day we do indeed vote for all of this.  It’s actually better to elect an AOC to burn this era down (unintentionally) than Susan Collins or some decrepit Dianne Feinstein.  We keep electing the same people, and not because of Dominion voting systems, but because we’re stupid.  Especially with Senators.  They have a six year track record of betrayal and somehow at least 50.1% of the electorate sends them back, year after year.  By people with nothing.  They live in squalid apartments and trailer parks.  People who now watch Newsmax instead of Fox.  I watched it recently.  Zero critical thinking.  The same exact programming with a slightly different logo.  Most of the country could be eating bark from trees in a desperate attempt to survive and never think once to change up their voting habits.  Not that any vote matters on its own, but the collective stupidity is astounding.  People are easily led and easily lied to.  Maybe the middle class doesn’t deserve to be middle class.  They sure as hell don’t act like they deserve anything more than poverty.

                They’ll literally be foreclosed on, worse than 2009, with 401Ks vaporized, roaming the countryside and still be voting for these people.  The problem with the white middle class is that it’s no longer middle class, as defined by Max Weber and his “middle class morality.”   The middle class is now just as indebted as the poor, only with mortgages, has the morals of alley cats, popping pills and turning to the bottle. Their 15 year old daughters getting knocked up by the neck tatted 22 year old down the street who works on his motorcycle…or a black guy.  Not that this wasn’t happening 40 years ago.  That’s why they were rushed off to the abortion clinic, because a baby bump on your teenager still had a stigma.  Binge watching Netflix shows that are borderline if not outright Satanic.  Having to walk sideways through their living rooms from all the junk they’ve bought on credit.  I really don’t like these people and no longer root for them.  They need to hit the wall.

            NY14 went for AOC because it’s now a “Latinx” district.  People want to ignore tribal voting, but it exists. The most hilarious example in recent years was this Cook County judicial electionhttps://tinyurl.com/y5kl8nqh. Guy couldn’t win as PhilSpiwak.  Won as Shannon O’Malley.

        It’s funny how tech utopists want to create a walled garden of limited choices. It sounds rather Edenic, but for some reason humans have consistently chosen to operate outside the confines of utopian limits. Because human nature is immutable in this way, the attempt by tech companies to control people by their smartphones will eventually run into the issue of enforcing compliance. People on the margins will only be motivated by violence, not ostracism, and as more people are marginalized more violence is needed to maintain order, which becomes increasingly expensive and less effective. But yes, knowing how to code and manipulate patent law makes you an infallible genius.

            Lumping all ‘Boomers’ together to assert some allegation is as simplistic as any such broad generalizations. I’ve tried to live my life within Christian teachings, been married for over 50 years, served in the infantry in Viet Nam, enjoy my grandchildren, and am retired.  What exactly is it that I have to answer for and to whom, other than my God?

                You can answer for thinking you’re such a special and individual snowflake.  How many times have others posted NAXALT?  How many times does it have to pointed out that everything is not all about you, personally?  I may hate everything modern women and boomers stand for, but I’m a woman and a boomer, like it or not. Generational labels tend to be . . . generalizations.  Deal with it and drop the passive/aggressive stance.

            Just a friendly reminder that Trump signed every Omnibus Spending Bill they sent to his desk. Including the one preventing him from building a wall using any prototype, and the one that prevented him from deporting any illegal with a minor in their household. Each time he could have signed a Continuing Resolution, but chose not to.

                The way I’ve heard it described is that for the (((Left))) and its pets is that violence is like a volume knob from 1 to 10 they can adjust as needed.

For conservatives violence is like a switch that can only flip from 1 to 10 with great difficulty.

Once that switch flips though…

                People are starting to ask me what to do. It’s coming soon.

Plus government has lots of guns. Why should they be submissive to people who are making them irrelevant? Best I can tell they’re still worried about paying the bills. Much better for them to cut bait and make common cause with the people who don’t depend on them imo.

In the near future, what’s left of government will make a strong ally. Cities will be ripe for retaking, and with them, civilization.

                    Cities will be ripe for retaking, and with them, civilization.Yep but you will have to be alive and how the manpower and resources to do that which you will only be able to do if you have Community before hand…

                        Community is spot on as always. Cities are not civilization though, They are a technology that allows strangers to live and work together to generate more wealth.Beyond energy costs they also come at a terrible social cost . They shred IQ and reduce population do to increased living costs and more opportunities.We are going to need a lot of population growth to afford the  luxury of cities and that may not happen for decades.

                    The city issue will be a bit strange as many of them will have to be partially demolished and scavanged for resources.The reason for this is we will have had horrendous losses on all sides and we have a far too efficient and thus fragile food generation system.We’ll need to go back to nasty things like urban slaughterhouses and taking large chunks of arable land now in cities and making small farms of it.This might lead to larger family sizes but as we recover, any such bubble will be an illusion. Once people no longer need kids as labor or decide instead of the kids running the family greasy spoon (franchises are liable to be banned) you’d rather your IQ 120 son go to college, the TFR will than decline.This is predicated on a recovery being possible though. At the end of this mess almost everyone even if physically healthy will have serious trauma and things like hording food, distrust of strangers and fear of novelty will become normal.An armed society is a polite society but a society in which most people have PTSD is going to be very slow to recover.We know all this from the fall of the USSR, its still nowhere near recovery after several decades and something nice like the US bailing out Europe after WW2 isn’t going to happen. China isn’t us.

While I prefer rural living cities are centers of law culture and commerce. Unless we want to be Mongols we need them 🙂

                            If we retain our technolgy and the beneficial previous works like good law of the past, granted both questionable assumptions, we won’t need cities nearly as much.More people will be in agriculture do to the economic collapse and what factories we retain can be out nearer to smaller towns.As for culture, cities are again no longer needed as incubators with the tech for production and sharing of information being democratized,

        The emerging social credit system and “freedom passes” are what the new ruling class thinks will replace the social capital they have devoured.

        “The irony is that this was the approach favored by fascist movements, but no one dares mention that bit of history.”Because, like a lot of “fascism”, it’s just common sense. It’s no more essentially “fascist” than speaking German or Italian. Compare the way “progressives” promoted eugenics. (Canada has a Progressive Conservative party).It’s also “Christian socialism” hence the number of Euro parties with Christian in the name.In fact, it’s what any rational society would create; “liberalism” (Europe) or “libertarianism” (US) is the irrational outlier.Fun fact: I attended a Catholic college in Canada long before PC, but Canada still had lots of sensible socialism: strong unions, health insurance. I had a Hegel instructor who was an American draft dodger … from WWII. He was a German-American who had not wanted to fight his own people. I once asked him his politics, and he paused a bit and said with a sly grin: “Well, I was a Christian socialist, but eventual became a National Socialist.”Speaking of PC, in Europe, people can express their opinions without fear of losing their jobs (and thus their health insurance) thanks to labor unions, while American conservatives have been convinced (by whom?) that they are “freer” thanks to muh 1st Amendment and muh “right to work”. Outlets like American Spectator used to run articles about how sick people in the UK were dying by the 1000s in long lines for getting health care, and  joking about no one working in France because no one could be fired. They’ll collapse any day now!

            I mostly agree with this.  And we now have the worst of both worlds on healthcare.  We get to pay for health insurance now, without the actual care at the end.  A $6k annual deductible for most people is not actual insurance.  Either option, a socialist system or a full cash upfront system would be far superior.  But instead let’s blow it all on F-22s to bomb Ay-rabs for Israel.

                Trust me, socialism sucks regrading healthcareI know from Italy that you get all the africans and weirdoes plus the pensioners in the public system.  These are hospitals fromMussolini days and the doctors tend to be the bottom of the barrel. Anyone with a decent job opts for private care, and any decent job one of the main perks is private health insurance.  The best and newest facilities are private, and the best docs.The same would happen here.  Unless someone thinks  the Kardashians are going to be sharing their doctors with us and we’ll be bumping into them in  the same waiting rooms.Never going to happen. The best Doctors will go where the money is.  Everyone else will get the rungs below.  The upper middle class will likely form some kind of consortium to get the above average docs.  The poor as always will get the shit and the long waits and the rationed servicesI think we should consider forming a public system or clinics in poor areas to help with 90% of routine care.  Put the docs on the federal payroll like with public defenders, etc.  Young docs can cut their teeth there too, and allow nurses to take ouch of the burden.Then leave everyone else out of it and alone.  And treat healthcare as a form of income, so at least the poor pay taxes on it.  You get $1,000 in health services, well that’s treated as income, and adjust the tax brackets to at least get something out of them.Free ride is over.  We all pitch in.

                    The biggest issue is having a private path for when the socialism fails, which it does.  In some countries it’s downright illegal for a doctor to just hang out his shingle for cash.  In wealthy areas of CA many doctors are now on a cash basis already.  What I don’t want is to share the same hospital with losers, which is what’s going on now.  One person in one bed paying a million, the next one a homeless guy on Medicaid.  I don’t want to see these people when I’m well, especially not when I’m sick.  I remember seeing an Italian hospital getting off the Autostrade near Rome.  I remember saying “whoa!, I would hate to be in the death trap.”  Looked like a sad welfare project from the 50’s.  Funny I remembered that when you brought that up.

                        JR.  Exactly.  Follow the money.  When you can convince me that the rich and politically powerful will get the same health care you are planning for me (“free” of course), I’ll listen.  But the reality is that TPTB will in some form, “opt out”, and get better care and better results than us surfs.  All I want is the same chance.
Of course, that costs money and not all of us have such money—but that is the way of the world, and always has been.  I refuse to let egalitarian delusions be the death of me.

                        I hear ya.Why it’s becoming ever more apparent to me, and you all as well, that we need our own community.  All we really need is a town doctor for 95% of the stuff.  For the major stuff and how to handle that, I’ll leave that to the more intelligent among us.Even a medic who worked the war fields or a nurse are invaluable.  They can handle pretty much everything except major surgeries.I live in CA too. I have health insurance but pay cash at the clinic in Burbank if I need something basic.  It’s only like $150 for basic stuff.

                The health insurance system is fairly self-contained from a financial perspective. The money generated by the outrageous premiums and deductibles we suffer is being transferred to pay for free or extremely subsidized care for the ever-expanding pool of the poor. I used to be outraged by this, but the reality is that globalism has so completely destroyed the earning power of the working class that they simply can’t afford health insurance anymore.Biden has indicated that his “government option” will only be open to persons at income levels which would qualify them for medicaid under expanded Obamacare, but who live in states that did not expand medicaid. In other words, it effectively provides a federal override of a state’s decision not to expand medicaid under Obamacare. This will severely penalize the states that expanded their medicaid program, and I would expect them all to drop it.The Democratic hard left wants a government option open to all, which will crash the system. I’m growing increasingly in favor of this option.

                    If we can have toll lanes on highways where you can avoid traffic we should have a whole separate ‘Paying” unit at hospitals.  We’ll NEVER just abandon government sponsored healthcare.  So the best option is that once someone is stabilized in the ER, they go one of two separate wings.  The private wing with the butterfly garden and concierge service and all the best doctors, and the “public wing” for all the losers who abused their bodies anyway.  No different than a cruise ship with different areas for different people.  Some hospitals have the corner suites you can pay for, but that sucks because you’re still served by the same people.

                        Good.Private health insurance is often as not no better than socialized medicine and is part of the reason many drugs are so damned expensive in the US as to be unaffordable and we spend a lot more for health care than other nations.Greedy financiers are poison.Hybrid systems that have both elements and State mitigation of costs work rather well though , solid life expectancy and cover everybody.However because the Supreme Court considers money to be speech we cannot do that and our government is up for the highest bidder.Its hoplessly broken until we get a new system.

        All true, now go deeper. Where does this lead? Two archetypal possibilities. One, the gravy train keeps rolling because we truly live in a post scarcity world in which production is on autopilot and boundless (beehive model, drones subsist &amp; elites thrive). Or two, the economy crashes when governments run out of Other Peoples Money (but first, the elites hightail it out of town after grifting every possible dime of wealth). As in California and Illinois, what happens when those public pensions find that the cupboard is empty and all the 401ks also become worthless when the stock market crashes in unison? Yes, I know, more community organizing and voting will save the day!!!!

                    The “value” will evaporate when the demand suddenly plummets
Moral of the story: if boomers want their kids to inherit something, buy property and more the merrier.  Sure, leave some stocks for liquidity, and cash if you can, but millennials make are the folks secure you some nice real property.

                There is no Stock “Market.”  A market implies concepts like “price discovery.” What we have now is “injection of liquidity” (aka “money printer go brrr”.) As for RE, as long as we import 3 Million people a year, you don’t have to worry about the portfolio value of RE going down. You only have to worry about citizens being able to afford homes.

                There has been talk of such, wrt denomination/conversion to Treasuries.  But I doubt it.  Such would crash the economy and no one would keep paper currency or bank again.  Everywhere this has been done, economic downturn has occurred.

                My husband just shakes his head at his old co-workers who stuck with the fedgov, counting their pensions and stocks.  They really think they get to live the next 25 years the way the silents/boomers have for the past 25 years.  Regardless of voting/political machinations, demographics alone means they’re going to be wrung out and hung out to dry.

        Welcome to the emerging trans human paradigm.  AI is the new government.  How will the criminal enterprise cope with being replaced by brain chips?  Do they have the intellectual wherewithal to resist?  I’m pretty sure they are outgunned, in that respect.

        Add it all up, and seems to me we are in a place similar to early 20th century where the only option is to blow it all up in the war to end all warsarguments I would have with LIbs went this way.  I would argue that Yes, you can have gay men marrying, but then you upset a lot of people who are left steaming and stewing in private.   As these things layer up thicker, people either say screw it, blow it all up, or find me a strongman.  If the libs would have just taken things slow, let things develop more naturally.

            It seems the leftard takeover and corruption of society and our culture was fairly gradual up until the last decade or so.  Since, the degradation has gone into overdrive and a lot of people are looking around, thinking WTF and perhaps getting closer to a screw it all mentality and hoisting the black flag.

I see your point. There is a safe, natural rhythm to ‘progress’. Start changing things too quick and then tell people they cannot say anything about it does no one any favours in the long run. I think there was a Taki’s article by Jim Goad where he spoke about the possible reasons that so many mass shooters left behind lengthy manifestos.
Problem is, as we know, the average wokist is pissed off that you:

                there’s “progress” which is today’s world is forced on people
then there’s “change” which comes naturally and is a feature of life
Notice how the left has co-opted the concept of change and a person’s willingness to embrace it for political ends.  Man loves and needs change, say the change of seasons, the rolling of the world that brings new life.  But then these bastards stole even that form of trust and politicized it.

        Add on .. Macron is interesting. He was the great liberal anti-Populist international hope. After a near death with the Yellow Jackets protests over gas taxes he’s veered to the right accidentally against Muslims as he got into a slap fight with Erdogan over Libya (each has ambitions there). He’s outlawing Muslim organizations and deporting Muslim leaders.This could be an accident of his slap-fight with Erdogan. Or he could have inside info that his tax base has now collapsed and inside the Euro he must cut social spending that keeps Muslims relatively quiet and is readying himself for dumping them into someplace like Libya or Tunisia. He could solve a lot of his problems that way. He probably won’t but who knows?

            And as a teaser of things to come, here is a little story of TechLord minions and minor government stooges playing pay-for-play to arm themselves.
It should be noted that Apple Inc. and the Sheriff’s Dept. investigated themselves and found no wrong doing! The deal got soured when someone at the District Attorney’s office leaked the info to the Sheriff.

        Several things that are interesting. One, Rick Wilson wants Trump voters identified and “humiliated” and put in prison, with the help of Big Tech. The model being Cultural Revolution China which retarded that nation’s progress for 30 + years.Two, one Biden official plans a national soda tax, which even Bernie rejected. To be paired with plan meat, poultry, eggs, milk, and cheese taxes. Abolition of gun ownership and prison for blacks, and abolition of the police. Obama noted Dems should not mention abolish the police and AOC and the Squad told him to … shut up. Dems plan to abolish the US energy industry wholesale and there are rumors Biden will extradite some Special Forces and Generals to Iran for trial.This suggests two things: First that the primary objective of the ruling class is to humiliate and debase the Dirt People which not even Stalin or Mao did formerly. Each brutal dictator paid lip service to the “people” and ordered them depicted them as cardboard cutout heroics in Socialist Realism. They are convinced big data and money can buy them control. Second the US really is running out of money and needs to scare up taxes just like France has under Macron.

            Arguably, ever dictator in history was using or allied with lower class people in opposition to upper class people.  There are a few notable exceptions, but only a few, and they all devolved back to upper class oligarchy along the way.
