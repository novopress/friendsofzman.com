        Is this Popish arsehole worse than the Borgia? No, not really.
Me, I’m Catholic, still Catholic, despite this Pope being Satan incarnate, because the lesson is that it is the church, not the Pope, that matters.
This too shall pass.

            What was so bad about the Borgia?  They had mistresses, like many clergy at the time, as well as kings and princes.  They promoted family and pals to important positions, like… well, everyone today.  They were fat.  Anything else?  I’ve no idea what the state of their souls were, but we don’t know that about any present day popes either.  I know that they didn’t guffaw when common people said the Rosary, or yell at them that they were praying too hard, and they didn’t invite the Turks in to make themselves at home in Christian churches.  Overall, I’d take a Borgia pope over old Potatoface in the Vatican today, no question about it.

        My late husband was in the Maryknoll Seminary when he was 13, back in the 60s. He used to tell me that people would joke about the nuns and priests having sex, but it was really about the priests having sex with the seminarians. Unfortunately, those men are now in positions of power in the Church. And  yes, Vatican II was the start of it all. Think of all the years when anyone could go to Mass and understand it, no matter what their native language. It’s like the Tower of Babel now. You have  Pope that hardly ever mentions Christ. Jesus washed the feet of his disciples, not the feet of people from a religion actively persecuting Christians. I suppose the Church has survived bad Popes before.

            The church hierarchy is completely homosexual top to bottom (and in between).  It’s all a scheme to rook the faithful.  Pederasts to a man.  Just look at the demographics on who they were diddling…

                It’s worth noting that while homosexuals make up about 2% of the population, they are responsible for roughly 50% of all child molestation cases. Homosexuals began to infiltrate the seminaries in the early-to-mid 20th century. We shouldn’t be surprised that the child abuse cases finally began to surface in the 70s and 80s.

        That outfit has been dead to me for years.  Look at who is enabling Islamic I migration in your state, chances are it is catholic charities.  Throwing money in the basket on sunday is a sin, not sure if it’s venial or mortal.

            Please understand that the so-called “Catholic charities” that sponsor Islamic immigration are not funded by the Catholic Church. They are funded almost exclusively by Federal taxpayer money to perpetrate their could mission.

        I was seriously contemplating leaving the Catholic Church. Marxist Francis was the final straw. According to Biblical teaching, the Church will never disappear. I decided I’m here to stay despite being co-opted in the West. I will take the good along with all the bad. I will accept it is failing but I will ride that train until the end.

        Too bad Benedict resigned … the Argentine is a disgrace, incredibly shallow and posturing. Tell me, in what way are his ostentatious acts of public piety different from those that Christ condemned in the Pharisees?
Having said this, hasn’t the Catholic Church survived popes much worse than the Negro-toe-sucking Argentine?

        I know this is a bit off topic, but I find it strange how writers will mention the rampant pedophilia in the Catholic priesthood, but they don’t dare to mention the homosexuality part. I am in no way trying denigrate the Catholic faith- I am a Christian myself – by bringing this up, either. Nor am I criticizing you, Z Man. It seems fair, though, to point out that these homosexual pedos are only in the priesthood to be able to molest little boys and are not Christians. This never ever gets attention, and I believe this allows for more rot in the Catholic faith. Now, those same homosexuals, whether they have a liking for little boys or not, are out, right in your face as your gay head clergy guy, purposely helping to corrupt the church. There is a very popular gay priest here in the US… can’t remember his name… but I read something he had posted on his church’s Facebook page in response to someone who had politely objected to having their Catholic faith infiltrated by unchristian  gay folks, posing as leaders of the faith. His remark was vile, and sounded just like what you’d hear coming out of the mouth of some raging homosexual wearing nothing but a sock in a gay pride parade. Unacceptable, really.And, as I read further down in the comments, I see that I am not alone in my opinions. I thought that I would get banned for what I was saying, but no… this is why your blog is tops!

            Your question answers itself. The media covers up the homosexualist infiltration of the Church because homesexuals are a protected class that the media celebrates. Why, if they admitted that, they’d have to celebrate the Catholic Church as well! Given that the goal is to slur and denigrate the Church, the media focus has to be on child molestation exclusively. Of course, as I mentioned in an earlier comment, fully half of all child molestations are perpetrated by homosexuals, but that’s a little tidbit of information that has been buried in a hole so deep it barely sees the light of day. Someday of course, child molesters will be made a protected class, but until then, homosexual child molestation will be used as a cudgel against the Church.

            I’m not Catholic, so I don’t know all the ins &amp; outs of their traditions.  My 2 daughters attends/attended Catholic colleges, which, so far, are not insane like Marquette.  Marquette is Jesuit, for what it’s worth, so always inclined to be on the “edge” as far as holding to church doctrine. I would never send my kid there.My daughters’ schools are much more traditional.  Definitely lots of SJWs, sissyboys, metrosexuals, and other leftys around for sure, but they don’t make policy… yet.My Father-in-law is Episcopalian &amp; what you say is precicely true.  And very sad. Once a vibrant church, now dying. I’m amazed that people didn’t fight the homo takeover.  Did they not understand that it would kill the church?  Just a few old folks left in his church. 90% empty pews. Truly sad. Young families are not interested in buggery. Who knew?Back to the Catholic church..  there are outposts of traditional – Pre-VaticanII – churches out there.  Latin liturgy, Vulgate Bible, everything. Rome does not condone such “outlaw behavior”, yet they carry on.Also, some of you may recall the story of Ann Barnhardt, the sucessful Ag futures trader who gave up her business rather than be party to govt. fraud.  She is a very conservative, hyper-traditional Catholic who maintains her website from business days.A VERY intertesting site:http://www.barnhardt.biz/you will gain new perspective about what’s out there in Catholic land after reading her blog.  Hint: she likes skirts &amp; AR-15s.

        One should have known that the Holy Ghost had abandoned the Church when Bishop Roncalli took the name John XXIII, a notorious false medieval pope.

        This Pope is really horrile and is going to destroy the church.
I’m not Catholic but I did go to Catholic High School and sent my kids to Catholic High Schools.  More discipline, far less PC and related crap, a better atmosphere, etc…  My youngest has 3 years left.  I’m just hoping the rot spreads slowly.

As someone born at the very, very end of the Eisenhower Administration, I find myself saying that several times a day and with respect to just about every topic covered here by the Zman.

        Any religion that puts another person between the individual and Jesus Christ should be questioned. While I can appreciate the beauty of the European cathedrals, one must question the money that could have been used to feed, house and educate the poor and not just the stone cutters and artisans who built them. For centuries the Catholic Church was not about saving souls, but about control through guilt and ignorance. And when the church changes the fundamental teachings to lure in the masses and change from a perspective of guilt-ridden to guilt-free, it’s clear the message isn’t about leading people to Christ and redemption, it’s about putting coin in the church coffers at any price – even the souls of the mislead.

            The Catholic Church has been corrupted since it was founded.  It’s always been about money and power first, then saving souls second.  And that assumes you buy into their screwy ideas on theology, which I do not.

                The Catholic Church is a human institution, run by humans. Humans being imperfect, the Church will necessarily be imperfect as well. And the Church, having to operate in the temporal sphere, will become involved in temporal matters; it’s unavoidable. Money and power will be accumulated by any large human institution that is successful, and the Catholic Church is the most successful, longest-living continuously-run human institution on the planet. Nothing else even comes close. People complain that the church should “do more to help the poor”, but they forget that that is only one part of its mission– a part that, up until maybe 50 years ago, they did exceedingly well. Jesus was quite clear when He said that the poor you will always have with you, and that man does not live by bread alone. The Church must also glorify God on earth, which is why it sponsored many of the greatest achievements in art and architecture for almost 2000 years. Think carefully about that when you complain about the poor.The Cultural Marxists targeted the Catholic Church as part of its “long march through the institutions”, and Vatican II, “liberation theology”, and the homosexualist infiltration of the priesthood are the fruits of their work which have taken a terrible toll– but one can say the same thing about the rest of western civilization over the last century. The Catholic Church faces the same existential threat that we all face, only it’s worse because it is at the center of western civilization. It’s easy to say that Bergoglio is the problem, but really he is just a symptom of a larger problem. The good news is that Bergoglio is too corrupt and intellectually feeble to meaningfully change Church doctrine, but he can certainly undermine it, and is obviously working overtime at it. Given that the Pope is elected, this implies that the majority of the College of Cardinals is perfectly happy with Bergoglio, which is a horrifying prospect. The best-case scenario is that Bergoglio was put in office via election fraud. We live in dark times.

                    The following anecdote is too good not to be true…Supposedly Napoleon once threatened a cardinal by blustering “Your eminence, are you not aware that I have the power to destroy the Church?” The cardinal shot back: “Your majesty, we, the clergy, have done our best to destroy the church for the last 1,800 years. We have not succeeded, and neither will you.”
