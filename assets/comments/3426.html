        Late to this, so apologies, but then the tinternetz wasn’t working at our house…I don’t think the left hates Christians as such; what the left always hates is the majority currently in their own backyard. Right now that majority happen to be mostly white, mostly Christian, so the love they spread is for any minority who doesn’t have those labels. Ergo, the lefty-love is for brown-skinned immigrants who follow a cult which routinely despises the majority in their newly-adopted country.Also the left is quite safe in hating Christians. It is an easy-going sort of belief that allows itself to be denigrated without trouble. Of course, you can’t do that with islam so it is wise for the lefties to cosy up to them. You wouldn’t want to piss off a cult that demands you think nicely of them or else they will cut your head off, would you?Mind you, the day may come when the left gets all it wants and it finds their new ‘friends’ are now the majority who really, really dislike any minorities left behind and seem to have forgotten who made their way clear…

        The goal of the left – communists, etc. – is the destruction of capitalism and EVERYTHING that helps sustain capitalism; family, Christianity, freedom of thought, speech, etc., and the imposition of a totalitarian state imposed, by force if necessary, a government of, by and for the ruling elites.Towards this end, they will embrace ANY cause or ideology that will support this end goal. To wit, the ends justifies the means.This is why Stalin and no problem hooking up with Hitler, or why American and European communists had no problem accepting the extermination of millions by Stalin – “you have to crack a few eggs to make an omelet.”Radical Islam seeks to destroy Western Civilization and given that the enemy of my enemy is my friend, and that the ends justifies the means, it is a straightforward connection for the left to align with radical islam.The left understands that chaos, violence, disorder, mass murder, violent revolution is the ONLY way they will assume power, so they strive to create these very conditions. Embracing radical jihadists will help towards this endeavor.If millions die, no big deal; communists and leftists have never cared about this minor detail. What matters is the ultimate goal of total power.

        The modern Left has somehow come to believe that Islam is their soul mate in some way
At least some Islamic beliefs are weird inversions of Leftist beliefs, so that each finds the other familiar if not congenial. For example, the power of women’s sexuality. And, of course, both hate rival powers, primarily Christians and Jews.

        I may be too cynical, but Islam has never produced much worth worrying about and I expect that trend to continue. Without the US and Europe, Islam cannot flourish. If it gains control at the expense of the Occidentals, we will see first a steep decline and then either a Western revival (which will once again be overrun) or a whimpering end to humankind.

        My dad used to say to me “wishing don’t make it so.”  I guess these leftists didn’t have a dad like mine.

        Again, you break it down so simply that even a cultist could understand.“For this generation of Western radicals, ISIS is the Black Panther Party of their parents generation.”If only they could read it.

        True. The Left is in bed with Islam because the Left really, really hates White Christian America that much, with notable exceptions of course. The thing is, a person can be a liberal and still understand that Islam is a very real threat to Western democracies. But today’s Left seems either incapable of understanding, or is making a calculated decision vis a vis, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. But with friends like those, who needs enemies? The Left has engaged themselves in something that they cannot win. Short-term it plays into their disgusting plans to fundamentally transform this country, but they misunderstand the adherents of Islam. The Moslems are playing for keeps. One day the bell will toll for the Leftists,  and when it does they’ll find themselves at the point of the sword.
