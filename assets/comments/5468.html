        It’s actually Fiorina, not Farina. “Little flower” in Italian. She still sucks.

        Tell us the truth, this was a Carville column, wasn’t it?   Either that or you’re auditioning for a CNN slot.

        If Bush’s last name were Besh, he’d be playing golf with other former political hacks from Florida, and sitting on Boards for the rest of his life.Which is exactly where he belongs.
No more Bush’s. I’m done, and I cast my first vote for Nixon in 72′.
No more of this family.

        Bush can hang around for as long as he wants, it doesn’t matter. Anyone willing to vote for Trump is not about to hold their nose and vote for Bush. If Bush gets the nomination, I will not be voting for him.
Watched most of the “debate”, soooooo long, and to what end? Got tired of watching everyone take their shots at Trump instead of talking about issues, but thought he took it pretty well. And those faces he made were priceless! Your analysis, Z, was pretty amusing.

            So if Bush does get the nomination I can hardly believe you will cast your vote for Shrillary. Or you will stay home and not vote at all? There were many so-called evangelicals who rode out the last presidential election because they could not bring themselves to vote for a Mormon, or whatever idiotic reason they could conjure up. You can see how well that has worked out for us. I understand your frustrations, believe me. Our choices are always less than perfect, but do you really want 4 more years of this race to a morally and financially bankrupt Socialist state?

                I’ve played this game before. I’ve held my nose and against better instincts voted for people like John McCain. I voted for Romney. Millions of people chose not to vote, not because Romney is a Mormon, but because when push came to shove he revealed himself as a member of the Elite who was going to go along to get along.Do you really think that Jeb Bush is going to halt this country’s slide to socialism? He’s the flip side of the Hillary Coin. Almost nothing would be different if either one is elected, except maybe that Jeb wouldn’t steal furniture from the White House like Hill &amp; Bill did on exiting, however I do not believe that either one will be their party’s nominee. The idea of me voting for HRC is laughable, and if by some confluence of events the Establishment GOP maneuveres Jeb into being the nominee, no, I will not vote for Jeb. If I have to write in the candidate of my choice, I will, call it my protest vote, but I will not give my consent or my assent to leavings offered the country by the Establishment elites.

        Nailed it.  I think anything and everything that occurs on the Republican side is just the GOP doing it’s all to oust Trump.  They are now the party of anybody but Trump.

        I pretty much agree with your excellent analysis! Since I lived through the Sixties, I am expecting an assassination attempt on Trump, if he wins the nomintation. I think it was a good move for Trump to be conciliatory this time out to the other candidates. And I think it’s time for  him to roll out another paper, probably on tax reform this time. I suspect that all his policy papers will be written by Tea Party types. There’s a rumor that Bolton is writing a policy paper on foreign policy, but that could just be a rumor.But what fun! It’s a lot more exciting than Jeb vs. Kasich!
