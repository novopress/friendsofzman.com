        “Mischief from Russia in the Ukraine”???  Apparently you are unaware of the activities of our State Dept. in hiring neo-nazis and rent-a-mobs to overthrow the legitimate government of the Ukraine, and the subsequent murderous activities of those hirelings, against women and children in the East.

        Islam was failing the day after Mohamed invented it.  But it still spread across the Middle East,  North Africa, and into Iberia like wildfire.  Goat herding caravan raiders took down the most technologically advanced centers of classical civilization is a couple of generations.  (Eventually turning the conquered territories into failed crap-holes)
They used demographics, bullying and intimidation, raids, rape, and terror.  Worked back then and it’s working now.

Not bad as a zinger. Sounds good, but I’m not at all sure what it means. Care to elucidate here or in another item?

        If Islam is dying we should encourage that and not give root to new life by taking in Muslim lifeboats. We did not arrive at this time where we would even meet the Muslim trying to come up the drain until we began circling it ourselves.The point of the Austrian ultimatum to the Serbs was to make it so insulting that it would be refused, sparking war. But the Serbs threw a wrench into that and accepted. That could not deter the German plan for Pax Germanica.Adolf picked up Bismark’s brief a generation later.English historian EDWARD CRANKSHAW“The tragedy of Bismarck, apart from the profound personal tragedy of a man of wonderful gifts corrupted, was not that he subordinated morality to the supposed needs of the state: most other statesmen of his time did that, including Gladstone. The tragedy was that he exalted the amoral concept of politics into a principle; and that, as a corollary, because he succeeded with such dazzling skill through the nine miraculous years which culminated in the foundation of the Reich, his countrymen surrendered to that principle.”Sixty years ago I began reciting a pledge every school day. I would be obedient to the one universal State. It was a prayer, meant to correct the model of the Founders. One nation, not several. I could not know that. But for my obedience I would be protected from my enemies and be part of something powerful.  Not for fifty years would I fully understand how odious this prayer would have been to the men convened in Philadelphia.We become all that we are without knowing why.

        Many long years ago I took a course entitled “History of the Origins of War” taught by Donald Kagan, father of Robert, co-founder of the PNAC. The course was memorable and the unit on WW I was fascinating. The Kaiser was portrayed as a resentful relative of cousins George V  and the Russian czar, given that the Kaiser had a withered arm. Also in play was the possible naval rivalry.Anecdotal comment: I have  a significant number of Muslim friends made over thirty years ago, Sunni and Sh’ia both, and nearly all of them have become more religious and much more conscious of their Muslim identity. These folks are very well educated polyglots, all well-to-do, very cosmopolitan, but…

            You only think you have Moslem friends.
Qur’an (5:51) – ”O you who believe! do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends; they are friends of each other; and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend, then surely he is one of them; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.”

        On the fateful runup to WWI, let me recommend Christopher Clark’s “The Sleepwalkers.” It is eminently readable and still manages to show the great complexity of interests and machinations in pre-war Europe. Among other things, it does away with the fixation on “the Kaiser” as being a great villain. If anything, he apparently was a mediocre and even rather benign figure who had no great impact on how things developed. One should take care not to look anachronistically at WWI in the light of WWII and try to find a Hitler-ante-Hitler in the Kaiser.

            Agreed about the Kaiser. He is best understood, I think, as not very competent and overwhelmed by events. He needed a Bismarck, but he also needed to be a Monarch who would accept a Bismarck.

            Fritz Fischer in his book Germany’s aims in the first world war makes it clear that german territorial ambitions are to blame. They deliberately encouraged Austria to be inflexible towards Serbia which made the war inevitable.
Having said that there was no shortage of stupid leaders on all sides. Pride made French leaders unable to accept that they were second rate power compared with Germany. And the Russians feared German designs for eastern Europe .

                “They deliberately encouraged Austria”
So whose fault was that? Germany’s, or Austria’s? Kinda silly to think of this as a major factor.
Wars happen because it is in the interest of the ruling class, or because they incorrectly believe it to be. Avarice or stupidity, and usually both.

        How do you justify thinking that countless Muslims moving to an accommodating and fearful West in which they know they can earn (or simply receive) much more money as a collapse? Islam is rising. The power of Islam is rising within its adherents and thanks to mass muslim immigration, Islam is gaining a foothold in Europe and in the West. Actually, in Europe it’s gone way beyond a mere foothold. Europe is becoming part of the Muslim world, which means that its wars now take place, in part, on European soil.I put it to you that unless you can actually show that fewer Muslims adhere to Islam in Muslim countries, it’s impossible to credibly argue that Islam is collapsing.Muslims are getting more religious, not less. Again, the word “collapse” is inappropriate. If nothing drastic happens, Islam will conquer Western Europe and perhaps then they’ll wage war (jihad, actually) on Eastern Europe.You could say Islam is in crisis, that it’s writhing and kicking, but so long as the number of Muslims (and devout Muslims) grow, it’s getting stronger, even if its countries are weak and struggling in a religious earthquake in which sunni and shia techtonic plates collide.

            Yes, Islam is indeed rising. What you are forgetting, Zman, is that Islam is constantly at war with itself, even when it is at war with the infidel. And what appears to be an Islam-on-Islam conflict is better characterized as a conflict between middle-eastern Secularists and middle-eastern Islamists…and the Islamists are winning, hands down. Just about every middle-eastern secular regime has been overthrown, and Syria is fighting for its secular life. Iraq is nominally secular but de-facto Islamic thanks to ISIS. Egypt is an interesting case as they mounted an anti-Islamist counter-revolution, but who knows how long that will last.And, look at what the Islamist victories have meant for the non-muslim minorities in the middle-east– back in the mid-20th century, roughly 20% of the middle east was non-muslim. Those minorities have been gradually killed or driven out over the last 50 years, with the process accelerating since 2003; today, the entire middle-east is virtually 100% muslim. It is worth noting that all of this has happened with the active cooperation of the western elites– either on the battlefield (thanks, George W. Bush and Barack Obama) or on the cultural front (Bush dubbing Islam the “religion of peace”, the leaders of western europe throwing open the doors the Islam…and Obama, I won’t even get into, his open declarations of support for Islam are too numerous to document). Obama has singlehandedly ruined a gigantic swath of formerly secular middle-eastern nations.No, it is clear that Islam is not just surging, they are winning on every front they are fighting on.

                57 Moslem-majority countries so far, and counting. In one generation, Sweden will join them, possibly France. There are approximately 196 countries in the world. That’s a bit under 1/3, I believe. No country that has been conquered by Islam has managed to throw off that oppressive, civilization-destroying yoke without outside help. So yes, Islam is ascendant, once again.I’ve said it before, this is the Third Jihad. If the West doesn’t rally itself from its Leftist propaganda-induced stupor and give Islam a Super Smackdown, we will go under eventually. A culture that has forgotten itself has no reason to defend itself and falls to the “barbarian at the gate”. But this time we are actually importing the barbarians! And the barbarians are sure of who they are and what they want.

Not in Syria. There it’s the shia vs the sunnis. What a pity they can’t both lose.

                    In Syria, it’s a secular (Baath) dynasty versus Shia (Hezbollah) versus Sunni (ISIS) versus Sunni (al-Qaida).  Is there any “least bad” option?  Hard to tell.

                        Sorry Craig, but no.Assad is an Alawite, which is an offshoot of Shia, which is why he was so (and is) so closely allied to Iran (Shia) and to Hizbollah (Shia). Assad is not fighting the Shia Muslims. He is with them. And the Shia and the Sunni forces fight each other.  Meanwhile, some Sunni fight other Sunni, namely Al-Qaeda linked forces fighting Isis, over the strategy of Jihad, which is linked to theology but also linked to power, since the Isis people were part of Al-Qaeda and broke away.Al-Qaeda believes the Caliphate should come at the end and that fighting Shia should also come at the end and that right now Jihadists should join forces and fight the real infidels : )Isis had the novel idea that they should start at the end result, with a caliphate (conveniently run by them) and with in-fighting.

        Islam is at war with itself, and “we” are taking sides, the Iranian side to be exact. Obama’s middle name is Hussein, and since everything is all about Obama, one should be aware that Hussein is a Shiite name.  The name is derived from the name of a martyred grandson of Mohammed, and is central to the Shia faction of Islam.  Obama’s fierce introspection tells him to support the heritage of his “father”, which turns out to be the Iranian side of the Islamic food fight.  Just another tidbit to throw into the plot, as things get ever more strange and unstable.
