        Regarding big data, trillions of data is a lot to search and find something meaningful to be pro-active about.
But, where I think the danger in this big data lies, is the ability to filter it to down to a single person, maybe a CEO or a politician whom you have a differing opinion, for example. Now the dataset is thousands of records, easily scanned to find some bit that someone finds offensive — requiring the target to be investigated, fired, or forced out of office.

        You’re absolutely right that the real brains are in the private sector rather than in the NSA.  However don’t assume that because the pile is so big that it is not of any use.
Big data has been the name of the game and smoking smoking hot at startups here in the valley and at the big companies(google, fb et al) for the last 5 years.

        Speaking of police bullshit masquerading as science…How about the idiocy of lie detector tests?Here’s an excerpt from Penn &amp; Teller on the subject:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bScv6kfxRyE(This whole show used to be free, but alas no more. Still you get to see the uber-beta boyfriend and the scary girlfriend and other good stuff. )
And if you’ve never watched:“Don’t Talk to Police”A law school professor and former criminal defense attorney tells you why you should never agree to be interviewed by the police.

It’s long but worth everyone’s time.

        Hell, several FIB agents pleaded to investigate those Arabs learning to take off but not land in simulators. Jamie Gorelick refused them permission on civil rights grounds. Civil rights for alien Arabs. After 9/11 she was promoted several times to cause disasters at other government agencies, and made 18 million bucks on the way.

        There’s no way to process all that information NOW – but they are storing it. There is also no way to know when (or if) some new technology will be able to do it. Admittedly, it will probably be too late for any useful purpose by then. But the NSA will be able to say, “We told you so.”
