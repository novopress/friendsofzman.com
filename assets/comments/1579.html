        I’ve read Mr. Slim’s semi-fictionalized autobiography, “Pimp: The Story of My Life”, and it’s worth a read. Not exactly great literature, but decently written and very interesting. I recommend it — with a grain of salt.
One funny thing is all the black prejudice in the book against “high yaller” black people, but ten minutes with google shows that the author and all his friends we know about were very light skinned. But he was selling books to dark-skinned customers.

        The Hollywood machine, advertising and their associated parasites understand the way to pimp their product is to humiliate the buyer. There was a time in America when to be famous, you had to be talented, interesting or at least very proficient in what you did. Today however, we aren’t quite sure why celebrities are rich or famous. Why, they are just ordinary individuals like us who get more publicity. They aren’t very good singers, not much chop at acting, will never be remembered for their charm or athletic prowess. They are your next door neighbours but they are better than you! For what exactly, we aren’t sure but you aren’t shit compared to them so buy the magazine with them on it, tune in to the reality sleaze and spit on them with the rest of the community, mock them at the water cooler. It’s all an effort to smash the consumer’s self-esteem and make them vulnerable to the product.Your heroes are soon to be the pimps and whores, drug-dealers and thugs. You are nothing compared to them.Not even a conspiracy, this technique is known to be very effective and is rewarded within the marketing game.
