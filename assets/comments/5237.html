        White privilege? Doesn’t exist today. If it did you’d have light-skinned blacks and Latinos trying to “pass” for white. Instead you have the verso, because if you know the whole racial identity trope is just horse poopie, you know how to game the system.

        If you subsidize behavior, you will get more of it. It is easier to get into better colleges if you are black. Black-owned businesses are, in many industries, guaranteed set-asides. And, of course, blacks are allowed to engage in self-aggrandizing aberrant behavior not only without sanction, but reward for doing so. Etc., etc., etc.

        Assuming he dresses for effect I would need, I suppose, to see more pictures of him to make any assessment from the image you posted, but… Having black hair and a (skimpy) black ‘tash and chin stubble of a beard, with the attendant heavy black framed glasses, all helps to ‘darken’ his colour, but the giveaway must be the white shirt: against that his skin tone looks darker. I agree that he seems to have some black ancestry however.As for his rough time at school, I have to say some kids pick on other kids not because of skin tone but just because they are nerds, bores or simply pathetic. Harsh world, but there we are.But what intrigues me more is the idea that even a little ‘black’ in a person makes them ‘black.’ So does one eighth black ancestry mean, despite being seven eighths white, that a person is automatically regarded as black? I imagine in the fullness of time there will therefore be very few white people to torment others. Then we can see how much more happy the world will be.

            In America, the “one drop rule” was the standard through the middle of the last century. Basically if you had any black ancestors you were black. As a practical matter, that meant one black grand parent as no one was going to research you family tree.On the other hand, blacks applied a paper bag test. If you were darker than a paper bag then you were “full black” and otherwise you were mixed race. Later, the light skin blacks would use this as a form of discrimination. The “brown paper bag parties” were a way for mixed race, light skinned blacks to separate from other blacks.

                I like the brown paper bag test, which I assume is only possible if you have a standard set shade for said bags. Freelance baggers making their own shades would create havoc…

                That’s what kills me about all this “race is a social construct” stuff.  Ok, sure… but why then are we bringing back degrees of skin tone straight out of the 19th century?  If this were 1854, we’d be debating whether King was “high yellow” or an “octoroon.”  Seems like a rather odd way to go about building racial harmony.

        He’s not 100% white. He looks like he has some black ancestry, although a pretty small amount. I knew a couple southerners in the military who may have been 1/16 black.
