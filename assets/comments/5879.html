        Jonah Goldberg is an anti-French jerk. Who cares about anything he has to say?

        Are we really sure that 0bama isn’t religious? He really seems to actively dislike Middle Eastern Christians and Jews. When has he ever said a single kind word about them? Similarly, can you name a single action the administration has taken that has helped them in the slightest? His pro-Muslim sympathies, on the other hand, are well-documented– even though everyone seems to pretend they don’t exist. He’s at least nominally Christian, which would imply that at worst he’d be a completely neutral party and should be sympathetic to all sides equally. But since he entered public life, his words and actions have consistently been pro-Muslim and anti-Christian/anti-Jewish.It’s an ironclad fact that in 2008, the chances that an openly religious Muslim could be elected President would be exactly zero percent. So he certainly would have a powerful incentive to hide his Muslim faith, if he had it.Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. The “residual sympathies from his youth” argument simply doesn’t carry enough explanatory power. Frankly the idea that 0bama is a devout Muslim who is actively hiding his faith seems to better explain his words and actions over the last dozen years.Remember, it was Saudi money and influence that got him into Harvard Law School…and of course there’s that mysterious gap in his resume in the 80s. Plenty of time to make his Hajj and of course “visit all 57 states” of the OCI.

        And, confirming your worst fears, the pajama boys at Vox, have been talking with 0bama’s national security “inner circle” in the wake of the Paris massacre.  Their conclusion, not surprisingly, is that in the wake of a similar massacre in the US there’s really nothing that they can do:“What do you do when the moral and emotional stakes of an attack seem to call for war but there is no war that can be constructively fought?That’s a question Barack Obama’s national security advisers have grappled with for months, if not years, as I understand from conversations with them dating to before Friday’s Paris attacks. Many senior administration officials at this point are part of the permanent national security apparatus, but the core group of real “Obama people” has a surprisingly dovish self-conception, where they see themselves operating in a world in which demands for military intervention are constant and endless— from the media, from congressional Republicans, from foreign governments and their allies in Washington, and from the permanent security bureaucracy itself — but America’s actual ability to engage in non-counterproductive interventions is quite limited.”http://www.vox.com/2015/11/18/9751340/paris-attack-dont-do-stupid-shitWorth reading the whole thing – if you can stomach the self-justifications of an entire administration of Quislings.

        Odd that Goldberg, of all people, should miss this.  He is — or, I guess, was — one of the few talking heads who acknowledged that politicians arepeople,often very strange and dysfunctional people.  He was great, for instance, at pointing out what a deeply weird guy Al Gore is.  I thought he’d have a field day with Obama, since all you have to do is look at the guy and you can tell he’s seven kinds of screwy.  And anyone who has spent a few minutes around Oreos knows that their insecurities are a mile wide and ten fathoms deep….But then again, if he pointed out what a weirdo Obama is, he’d have to acknowledge the manifest problems with Obama’s opponents.  John McCain was a senile old lunatic who thought he could bomb us back into prosperity, Romney’s quite possibly an android, and Freud himself couldn’t scratch the surface of everything that’s wrong with Jeb.

        I have my own pet theories on 0bama and Islam, which I won’t bore you with except to conjecture here that the reason that young Barry was sent back to Hawaii by his mother was that young Barry had started to spend a good deal of time down at the local mosque and his mother wasn’t particularly thrilled with that.  So it was back to Hawaii with Gran, Gramps and Frank Marshall Davis (btw – how many VPs of banks, like Barry’s Gran, associate socially with notorious communists like FMD?  I throw this out as just one example of the rather remarkable incongruities that mark the president’s largely unexamined and unexplained biography).A rational explanation of president’s policy preferences with regard to Syria and ISIS has defied the credentialed experts, so that perhaps the lack of comment on yet another glaring incongruity may not seem so odd when there are so many to chose from. Still, I find it useful to compare and contrast the actions of the president when negotiating a US status of forces agreement in Iraq (petulant, pouting, and peremptorily dismissive) and the nuclear “deal” with Iran (sanguine, patient, and unflappable in the face of daily humiliations).  I know of no expert who would dispute that had a US status of forces agreement been in place the Caliphate would be, at best, but a sliver of its present dimensions.

            That blog has linked to me in the past so I would assume they read me from time to time. That is a very popular blog from what I gather. I probably should read it more often.

                That “British Intellectual” is a retard, then. Neither Marx nor Freud have the remotest connection to anything even vaguely resembling Christian ideas. Jewish, on the other hand– you could at least make the beginnings of a case, considering they were both Jews.
