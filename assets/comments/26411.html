        “…The core of the current crisis is that no one can honestly answer the question that is the basis of all human organization, who are we?…”
The reason no one can answer that question is that there is no “we”.  There is only them and us.  Derb has it right when he describes our current state as one of “cold civil war”.

            I too wanted to highlight these couple of sentences. but I would say, as a Gen Xer raised in the 80s, that at one time, I thought that the rules did make the people residing in the borders of the US a “we” in that we all respected these rules.
Of course, there were problems with the rules, affirmative action,  but it wasn’t bad enough that I mistrused the rules.
But the rules are breaking down, and maybe because the rules , or the “proposition nation” could never make a “we”.

        Speaking of experts, I’m sitting here at my kitchen table trying to slog my way through my engineering alma mater’s 2021 year in review magazine after 2/3rds of a good ribeye and a glass of Argentinian wine.
The content and writing is so horrifically bad I’m gobsmacked. All the talk about making fair AI and projects to help the poor that are cover for developing the worldwide slave grid are the mere beginning….

            What is an unfair AI?
The concept is ludicrous to the extreme. If I had junior programmers that spouted such stupidity I would get them moved off my team in a heartbeat. A denial of the mechanics of the way any of the neural nets or classification algorithms are trained on data is indicative of someone who is going to be a shit developer, producing shit code.

                    As I said. Anti-reality nonsense combined with algorithmic ignorance.
You have to feed the algorithms knowingly false data in order to produce a fake pre-defined outcome that mis-classifies the real world.
You are training kids to systematically and intentionally falsify data as accepted practice.

        Our institutions may be run by “experts,” many even credentialed, but that doesn’t make them especially competent or even honest. I go way back (to my teens, and I’m in my 60s now) reading some of Dad’s books. He was a paleoconservative. I have read more than my share of “alternative” views of the Fed. One thing Z forgets to mention in the cited financial crises (and many more he didn’t) is a dirty little secret: the Fed exists so that the rich can get richer. I’ll spare you the details, but they can be found in dusty old books, or probably, for free on line these days.Not strictly related, but an excellent example of endemic government corruption, abuse of power and (if he’s right, and I think he is), tens, perhaps hundreds of thousands of needless deaths over the years, I highly recommend Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s current bestseller “The Real Anthony Fauci.”One probably won’t go far wrong assuming that such corruption is endemic in most agencies Federal (or Federally chartered; that’s a detail not well known to many — the Federal Reserve System is actually a private corporation with enormous powers). As one writer once said (Gary North, I think): Whose interests does it serve? Not yours. Not mine.

        “Experts say” “Experts say”…the 2 most discredited words in recent memory. Never used to bother me but it’s almost like a red flag whenever I see it now, it’s always in the twitter sidebar and practically every story from the MSM. If Biden somehow runs again that should be his campaign motto, lol.

        Yeah, let’s get rid of the experts. I have a great idea that dovetails nicely into that: let’s bring back the religious oracles. They’ll solve our problems for us. Who cares about two hundred years of modern-day practice into economics and technology and science, after all? With Covid, it’s such an EASY solution we should be blaming these experts for fumbling it in the first place. F**k, they’re ALL easy solutions.

            Experts are only expert if their predictions repeatedly are more accurate than the average.
Otherwise they are less than useless at best and highly dangerous at worst.
Everyone who fails to cross this line should be booted from consideration without exception.

                Maybe we should make an agreement with the ruling class, not that we won’t put their heads on pikes but that if they do us a solid, we’ll move them down the priority list for pikings. As Arnold said “I like you, I pike you last”.

I can’t see it happening given the sheeeeep passivity, but there needs to be real consequence for the admin class that has destroyed society over this f’ing stupidity.

            I have been saying for some time that lumping England in with Canada and Australia is not always the wisest decision. The Coronavirus idiocy just has not been policed as aggressively in England the way it has in much of the West. Mask policy in my neck of the woods has ,at best, been advisory.

        “Most years, the Fed chairman has better approval than the president.”
Most people have no idea who the hell the Fed Chair is or WTF he does. If Mark Dice were to interview random bimbos and Negroes on the street and ask them who Jerome Powell is, it would be hilarious. Probably not one in a hundred would have the slightest clue… maybe not even one in five hundred.

        This column is a bit flabby, unusual for Z. The Misesians, as usual, called this economic charade as they’ve called similar ones in the past. Granted you can always say the sky WILL fall and one day be proved right, but the LRC/Woods branch of the Rothbardian tree pretty much always gets it right.To the larger point: “Who We Are” evolves. The children of today’s mojados from South of the Border will be tomorrow’s conservative upholders of Anglo traditions. If I were a white nationalist, I wouldn’t bitch about “what have they done to our country.” I’d draw on my people’s traditions, strengths and values, combine with likeminded others, and, with the means we’d have at our disposal, buy land, start to rebuild and network with our betheren as we hunker down for the long run. It’s the three F’s: family, friends and food and a church and community hall to go with it. If it was good for Paul and Silas, it ought, within reason, to be good enough for me.

            Excellent advice.  That’s how the Others do it, since they’ve been dealing with corrupt liars in their society since forever.
An Indian- in Philly, I think, maybe Jersey- told me his people never worry about banks or babysitters.
They pool their resources so they don’t need outside help, with its strings attached.

                Alzaebo:  Just interior strings – you owe your extended family and tribe or jati any favors and employment and payouts you can finagle.  How to build a corrupt, nepotistic, tribal society with no social trust and no concept of the common good, i.e. all non-White, non-Western society.
Come on Alzaebo, you’re smarter than this.  And using an Indian in Philly or Jersey as a source?  Why are you even willingly interacting with him?

Anyone with employees (all tribe, of course) is completely frazzled.Trust?  Heck, it’s more like a high-wire act.

                That’s how the Amish do it. Then again, they ALL work like animals, save every penny to the point of living a largely 19th-century lifestyle, and reinvest heavily in buying properties or starting businesses… but it can produce prosperity.

                    Lol. The Amish are cash-poor, have genetic defects from inbreeding, and a surprising number of them don’t own the land they farm. Ironically, their supply chains are just trashed as everyone else’s because they are just as reliant on manufactured goods. At least, that’s what two of my Amish neighbors have told me. It ultimately doesn’t matter whether you’re tribalistic or open borders: if your lifestyle is predicated on buying manufactured goods at any point, you are going to struggle the next couple years.

                        At the moment with dairy getting squeezed, I don’t doubt they’re feeling pressure. At the same time, I had a neighbor who owned 6 farms when he died, and I know of another guy who bought a couple of farms just to do something with the money he had. And farmland here goes for $20-30k/acre these days. Basically if you’ve got your eye on a rural property with with enough land to build a small horse barn you dread seeing buggies at the auction lol. Maybe that’s just my neck of the woods.

                What broke me of gold-bugism was a book by David Graeber (sp?) called Debt. Historically, debt was only possible in high-trust societies, and led to economic growth. Hard metal currencies only existed when trust was low, and only happened long enough to restore social trust. I would guess there will be a return to a gold standard in my lifetime, but I doubt it will be the panacea the goldbugs claim.

        Who are we?  To paraphrase the TDS guys, we are a large, Jewish owned shopping mall without borders.  Our reason to exist is to consume product and do into debt, and to stay in debt, eviscerated and severed from all history and culture.But the mall is getting old and seedy, and full of dangerous foreign thugs.  It’s not a nice place to be anymore like it was in the 80’s.  And each store now has the same Chinese merchandise.In hindsight, America will clearly be seen for what it was.  The refined pinnacle of a modern consumer economy.  A short period in human history where humanity thought it could come together as one big food court, divorcing itself from ethnic ties and tribalism.  But tribalism doesn’t exist for the good times.  All nations, over a few generations, go through bad times.  Fragile consumerism can’t get us through that.  The concept of the tribe is genetically engrained for a group of people to band together in times of scarcity.  We haven’t remotely had scarcity since the 1930’s.  A time of scarcity alone will unravel the country and send it into history’s landfill, with all the Chinese things we’ve bought.

            Your post made me think of a couple lines from the great Jackson Browne song “The Pretender.”I’m going to be a happy idiotAnd struggle for the legal tenderWhere the ads take aim and lay their claimTo the heart and the soul of the spenderAnd believe in whatever may lieIn those things that money can buyThough true love could have been a contenderAre you there?Say a prayer for the PretenderWho started out so young and strongOnly to surrender– Though I am no Jackson Browne fan, that, right there, is some dang fine poetry.

                “The core of the current crisis is that no one can honestly answer the question that is the basis of all human organization, who are we? It is no longer easy to say what it means to be an American. The commonsense that are the rules of society are no longer making sense, which calls into question the basics of society.”I am an orthodox Christian, but do any of the other Z-manians feel that we’re drifting into a new “yuga”, or age, wherein the humans who are born 50 years from now will be another species entirely? As a school teacher I’m finding that today’s kids simply do not relate to the world in the same way I did, circa 1983. It’s not simply that they “don’t” understand the important things. Rather, I’m getting the sensation that they can’t.Perhaps the reason the “rules of society are no longer making sense” to the folk of today is that they are literally a different folk. It feels like today’s world is sloughing off a worn out skin, and the new “skin” will look nothing like anybody has ever seen or imagined. And perhaps I am nothing more than a superfluous wart on the outmoded skin.

        ” Empty shelves and spirally prices are not what people expect from the expert class. Things that could be acquired in days now take months because the supply chain is a chaotic mess.”One of the guys who came up with the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect wrote a book either on “experts” or there was a chapter on “experts” and how they screw up everything they touch.  He used an example from the BLM.  They took over some land to “improve” it.  Of course, comically and predictably, everything got worse no matter what they did.  Housing projects are a good example. Allegedly “scientifically” designed and managed by “experts” and largely seen today as one of the worst blunders of planning ever in the US.But in the private sector, experts perform seemingly miraculous feats.  Maybe their systems aren’t as complex or have any degree of randomness the way a natural system has. The fact that supply chain ever worked at all is a miracle of central planning.There was a similar period of supply chain wreckage at the end of WWII.  There is a video on YouTube of a propaganda short-film made by the car companies (industry association) about why the car companies are so behind schedule and why so few new cars are being made despite the war being over for 18 months at the time. They blame supply chains. It went all the way to 1949.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTWYBoGkgJM

        Rather than the Fed being particularly great at its job, I’d say that, like America itself, the fed is burning through capital built by it predecessors. By the early 1980s, the fed’s fund rate was at an astonishing 19%. In addition, private and public debt was at ~160% of GDP.This gave the fed a lot of room to play with. At first, it just used interest rates. Every time the economy or market show any signs of distress, lower rates. Then, in the recovery, you raise the rates back up, but not as high as they were before the recession, which allowed the recession to keep going. This also allowed for more and more financialization, i.e., debt, which, of course, boosted the economy.When the Dot-com bubble burst, Greenspan dropped rates to nearly zero, causing the investors to look for yield which very much pushed the housing bubble and driving total debt to GDP to 370%. When the fed tried to raise rates back up again, the market and economy collapsed. The debt was just too high to service, and you had a good old fashioned banking crisis.The fed then dropped rates to zero for the first time since the 1930s, but it wasn’t enough because the debt was too high, so the fed printed money to save the banks. Again, they weren’t geniuses. They did what governments have done throughout history.But fine, the fed did what it had to do to avoid another depression. But the debt was still there and rates were still crazy low.This was the moment when the “experts” should have said, “it’s going to hurt, but we have to fix this. We have to get the debt down and gets rates higher. We didn’t a have crash, but the next ten years are still going to suck as right the ship.”But they didn’t. The fed kept rates at zero and continued to print money to keep the economy alive. After initially falling from 370% to ~340%, total debt to GDP flattened out. There was no great deleveraging. Households got the message but corporations and the government kept borrowing more.Everyone knew that the problem was still there. The fed had just avoid dealing with it. Hell, the stock market and economy started puking when the fed tried to raise rates to 2% in the middle of the best economy in a decade. Did the fed stick to its guns? No. It dropped rates again.Even before Covid the repo market collapsed and the fed papered it over. Again, avoid, avoid, avoid. These aren’t experts, they’re cowards. We were heading for a recession even without Covid. Indeed, Covid gave the fed some cover.Regardless, when Covid hit, the fed was out of weapons. Rates were already near zero. So, the fed went nuts with QE, but even that wasn’t enough. This time we need huge fiscal stimulus to go with monetary stimulus.You’ll notice that there’s a very logical progression since the early 1980s. 1) Lower rates at the hint of trouble, but don’t raise them to their previous high after the recession. 2) When rates hit zero, QE. 3) When rates hit zero and even massive QE isn’t enough, fiscal stimulus through massive borrowing, much of which is financed through the fed.But the experts have hit the end of the road, because option #3 is causing inflation (along with other things). The economy is pushing back for the first time. The experts were doing anything special for the past 40 years. They were just using up capital built from the 1940s to the early 1980s. They were trust fund kids who finally blew threw their money.Now, the fed and govt are stuck. The economy is addicted to cheap money, but when the economy goes into recession, it’s in such bad shape that it needs QE and fiscal stimulus. But that leads to inflation – and voters really hate inflation. But raising rates isn’t possible because the debt load can’t handle it.The fed and govt have two choices:1. Leave rates low and let inflation run, which helps lower debt to GDP but pisses off voters. Also, if inflation gets out of hand, you have a serious problem.2. Raise rates and tank the economy.“Experts” wouldn’t have put themselves in this position. They had 40 years and a lot built-up capital to run the economy and money supply smoothly, and they blew it.

            The fed’s track-record is terrible.  It blew up one of the largest bubbles in American history at the time, the 1920s and then sat back and did nothing as the world went into a deflationary depression caused by the bursting of the bubble the fed itself created.With the exception of portions of the 1930s, which were highly deflationary, the fed has been causing inflation for as long as they’ve been around.  With the exception of the war periods, there was no inflation from the 1600s till the creation of the fed. Prices fell throughout that entire period.The problem is that our system is now entirely built around “growth” and if it does not grow, at least nominally, the wheels come off. As I understand it, a single year could undo the nominal gains of the last 30 years.  That every Dollar of debt we have is some one else’ Dollar of asset plus interest income. While it might have taken you 20 years to build all the debt you have, it gets defaulted on all at once.  A little inflation is the status quo. A lot of inflation is better than deflation in their minds (and probably in reality).A LOT more damage was done between 1980 and today than what was done between 1913 and 1929. It’s not going to be fixed in a decade.  The entire country’s productivity  has been hollowed out, auctioned off and/or shipped to other countries.  There are 10s of thousands of former factory sites with either shells of a building or no building at all.  Not only the physical destruction, but the psychological destruction.  Americans actually believe we are now in the “information age” as opposed to the industrial age.  Try eating or wearing  or living in “information”

                The dollar being the world’s reserve currency affords the US some serious benefits, but it also helped hollow out the manufacturing base.From the early 1970s onward, we had to run trade deficits with oil-importing countries because they could only buy oil with dollars. Well, which countries import oil? Manufacturing countries.First, it was Europe and Japan. Later, it was China and other parts of Asia. We turned over large portions of the manufacturing to them to balance out the reserve currency system.The world should have reset the global monetary system after the fall of the Soviet Union, but nobody in Washington wanted to do that. In fact, they put the foot on the gas with NAFTA and letting China into the WTO.Idiots all around.

                    And that idiocy traces back to the Bretton-Woods Conference. They teach you in school the Marshall Plan was created to rebuild Europe, but it was actually to implement Keynesian economics and the US as the reserve currency. This implementation of the US as the gold backed currency inevitably led to deficit – how else could the world do business in US dollars without the US flooding the world with dollars? The Nixon Shock, and its resultant drop in demand for US dollars, led to the aforementioned idiocy. Certainly, though, for a time, there were major perks.

I have never understood why purported conservatives were willing to go along with a highly unrealistic “all growth all the time” model for our country and economy.  It boggles the mind that anyone would think that good times can last forever.

            Every word that Citizen of a Silly country said above is true, and very succinctly written.  Even worse, a substantial increase in interest rates will put that $30 trillion of Federal debt alone into a pyramiding death spiral (not including state, local, corporate, personal, etc.)  Heck, it’s nearly there on its own in a few more years.Powell is no better or worse than any of the other clowns that headed the place over the years, but I think in hindsight, in even wanting a second term, like nearly all the others in that position, he chose his own ego and vanity over common sense, which would dictate that “Oh wow, I’m sitting on a powder keg.  Instead of wanting a second term the door won’t hit me in the a ss on the way out.”  So instead of sitting in Bermuda, watching the implosion, he’ll be blamed far and wide, especially by the politicians, as the man who nearly single handedly (the ultimate lie) destroyed the middle class and sent the country careening into a depression.  In another year or two, he will spend the rest of his life as a villain being chased by mobs.

        But it seems the first 200 or so pages are about HIV and the conjecture that there is no causal link between HIV and AIDS.No, the bit about AIDS is later in the book, and I don’t think Kennedy says as much. He describes how Peter Duesberg – one of the premier cancer researchers in the world and who proposed the missing link – had his career destroyed by Fauci. Kennedy seems agnostic on the matter but is scathing about Fauci’s penchant for solving scientific disputes with personal ruination of dissenters.However, the handling of AIDS is not the only health campaign he criticizes and gives several examples of where a short-lived vaccine program – approved by the FDA and NIH – killed an order of magnitude more people than the disease. If I were to have kids today, I’d look very long and very hard at the vaccines I’d subject them to.But almost everything Kennedy describes is way beyond scandalous. I’ve read most of it on the internet before, but Kennedy, supposedly, had his book thoroughly fact checked.Be advised that it’s a fairly demanding read with lots of names, lots of medical Latin,  lots of acronyms for obscure NGOs, quangos, government offices and institutes etc. Here’s a convenient link to an electronic copy – no personal information required for download, wink, wink:htt p:/ / library . lol/ main / B8D919A7007CCAD84DEDB4AF4E523ABC

He describes how Peter Duesberg – one of the premier cancer researchers in the world and who proposed the missing link – had his career destroyed by Fauci.”Okay, thanks for the clarification. As I said, I’ve not read it yet. I am actually relieved that RFK jr is agnostic about the link between HIV and AIDS because I honestly believe that link will remain standing after the dust settles. As I recall, AIDS came to the attention of medical science in the late 70s or early 80s because gays in San Francisco started dying of various opportunistic infections, mycotic pneumonias and others, that were normally only seen in patients with severely compromised immune systems. Something must of course, have wrecked their immune systems and what would that be other than HIV? The immune system normally rebounds from pharmacological insults, that is why transplant recipients need continued immunosuppressive therapy. And AIDS is predominantly a suppression of helper T cells, a rather specific suppression. So it has a specific profile of immunosuppression. Which leads to, has there ever been even ONE patient who had all the hallmarks of AIDS (as opposed to other immune deficiencies) who was HIV negative? I have NEVER heard of one.So RFK jr. not nailing his colors to the ‘it’s not HIV’ camp, will probably be beneficial to the credibility of his book. And there are many questions to be looked at. Maybe Fauci is not the crooked bandit some claim. I am agnostic as to that for now. But there are mountains of things we need to sort through now, after the Covid mess.

He doesn’t really nail his colors anywhere, he gives you the quotes, the statistics and the sources without committing to one or the other, although a lot of shenanigans can be perpetrated by selecting those statistics carefully, of course.
I’m only about halfway through – most of it is a critique of institutional incest, insider trading and naked corruption more than of faulty medical research, although he gives egregious examples of that as well.

                As an aside, I remember the AIDS-scare which crescendoed when I was in senior high. I can’t say it scared me away from sex, but it certainly made an impression on me, since the campaign was specifically targeted at heterosexual teenagers – the demographic least likely to catch HIV.
Twenty years later, I heard a rare interview with one of the involved politicians doing a mea culpa. She revealed that out of five generations of targeted Danish high school students, only two (2) non-junkie, non-homosexual kids had actually been infected and none had died.

                    I think the incidence (new cases) of HIV among straight, non-addict ethnic Danes is almost zero now. It fell from quite low to virtually nil when combined retro-viral therapy, where Denmark was fairly strong early on, began. The HIV public information campaign was not well handled, on either side of the Atlantic.

                There was a guy back about 1990, Michael Fumento, and I think he was one of those willing to entertain questions about the link between HIV and AIDS. I don’t know if this book addresses it but in 1990 he wrote “The Myth of Heterosexual AIDS”
https://www.amazon.com/myth-heterosexual-AIDS-Michael-Fumento/dp/0465098037
ETA: Ah, it’s interesting digging around in 30-year-old controversies. According to this article, Fumento supports the HIV-AIDs link (of which the author is suspicious)

        Who are we?As a result of prolonged affluence, we are now a majority of parasitic fat-asses driven by the Comfort First Imperative and solely reliant upon the “magic pill” solution for all problems, large and small. That is why we routinely elect the worst of us to high office and then naively expect them to lead us out of the morass we’re in. And that is a foundational dysfunction that can only be cured by a major change in our environment, i.e. collapse and the return of real hardship, existential threat, and the rebirth of natural fitness selection. The weak must die (or at the very least, not reproduce) and the incentive for strength and intelligence must reemerge as the prime driver.Yakking will not change our environment and the curative collapse cannot be avoided. The best we can do is to make it happen quick and then aid the rebound so as to minimize the negatives. How do we do that? 4S &amp; focus.

            Agreed. I have a formula for it: “Americans are too rich, too secure, too sell-fed, and they have way too much time on their hands.”
Our problems are those of rich people who have no *real* worries or problems. I’m sure that “Gender fluidity” is not no the radar screens of the parents of hungry children in Syria or Iraq.
So our “problems” are manufactured; not real.

That designation as “consumers” moved from econospeak, to what “Our Elites” felt free to openly state. It is but a short step from “consumers” to “useless eaters”.

        The part that Z-Man left out is that they don’t care because they will suffer zero consequences. In fact, the incentive structure exists for them to further insulate themselves so they can pretend to be experts and continuing make bad choices.
Most of these “experts” are political appointees – whether in business or in corporations. They are wedged into their positions in ways that makes extraction expensive.

The collapse is well underway. It’s not going to happen overnight. It never was. The dominoes have begun falling, and there is no stopping it.
Events have now gained their own momentum and are beyond the control of any power in this world. Events must now go to their logical conclusion, whatever that is. The notion that anybody can now control anything is an illusion.

In the process, ideas like genius, inspiration, and especially faith were jettisoned in favor of trusting the process.

        There seems to only be a crisis of doubt of who we are among White people. Chinese Americans know that they are Chinese. Indians are Indians. Mexicans are Mexicans or Mexican Americans. Whites have been told that they are plain Americans but see Whites demonized and their country changing in ways they don’t like.Experts, most institutions and the press especially have lost a lot of credibility with our side of the divide. But they are more revered than ever by the other side of the divide. 10 years ago I knew no lefty who held the NYT as a holy publication. Now it is a sign you are a low IQ Fox News watcher if you don’t respect the NYT. Most of the left I encounter  now view the CIA as heros who are defending the country from insurectionists.

            That is because most of them have a sense of where they come from in that their homogeneous country still exists, so it is concrete as a reference.
Whites in the Us and lots of European countries have had theirs destroyed so have nothing to point to that is a unity and say that is mine.
Pointing at such is just pointing at lots of aliens who should not be there, but its difficult to see what should be there instead as those memories are mostly dead.

        Once upon a time we could “replace” the experts by replacing the politicians.  Think swapping Arthur Burns for Paul Volcker.  And that there was a difference in these “experts”.  Now, as you have pointed out, the “experts” have merged into a singular parasitic class whose interests (and rice bowl) are very different from the rest of us.  Success or failure is immaterial to them, failure only hits the “little people” outside the beltway.  So we’ll get a war in Ukraine since it’s made many fortunes (or good livings) for the technocrats and the politicians they are fastened to as an out of the way place to launder NGO money and bribes.  But as Ben Stein’s father famously said, “things that can’t go on, won’t”.  While I still believe in the “slow decline”, there are more points where things could go from May, 1914 to August, 1914 in a blink.

        Something seemingly minor happened yesterday that is quite foreboding for the Fed. Larry Fink, the notorious and vile BlackRock CEO, indirectly criticized the Fed for planned and long-overdue rate hikes, saying this will flatten the yield curve. In and of itself, this would be mere corporate self-interest rearing its ugly head.Here’s the rub, and it is a big one: Fink is a de facto part of the Fed, maybe its most important member albeit a purportedly unofficial one. He has been appointed by the Fed chairman to buy assets left and right, mainly bonds, and many of the purchases directly benefit his personal financial interests. Fink is a demonic force in the United States who wants to implement the Great Reset and turn the nation’s population into serfs. Inflation of assets, many that benefit him, force the serfs to pay more for the food and shelter he and his fellow robber barons control.Coupled with the (non-)shockingly underreported reports of insider trading among Fed members and people in Congress and the government, either a total collapse is planned or anticipated, and they are getting while the getting is good.

                That’s possible. Either Fink and Co. will ditch their assets in the near future or lay back and buy up even more once the economy craters and people with million dollar shacks get thrown out of work.

                Larry Fink (Blackrock) is also the #1 vector for corporate Wokeness.Vanguard/Blackrock won’t purchase or underwrite commercial paper- that is, corporate bonds- unless they submit to ESG (“equity, sustainability, governance”).Since Blackrock owns not only company shares , but also the shares of the investment companies that invest in those shares, he’s got both the top and the bottom (Joe Public’s 401k) locked in his pincers.Fink was granted this power when he bailed out the Treasury with a $7T loan in 2008; in return he has the Federal Reserve banks as his direct backstop now to buy up all the country- corporations, real estate, and land rights- eventually.Excuse me, I meant “invest in”.  See Whitney’s “Industry capture” comment below.******(Heh.  My spellchecker brings up “wokenwaffen”.)

                    This is why you need a business that  is either family run not publicly traded or still run by the founder (i.e. the Ford motor corporation when Henry and his son ran things). That way the esg parasites can’t go after you as easily.

        If nothing else, this Covid nonsense has destroyed the medical profession forever. Now admittedly I have always been one of those people who just won’t go to the doctor unless I just can’t stop the bleeding (or equivalent), but Ididgo, on the assumption that the doc will know what this cold is that I just can’t shake, and will give me the appropriate meds. The meds were always the primary thing, but I assumed there was underlying competence, too.Post Fauci, I’d take my aches and pains to a goddamn Santeria shaman before I let an MD anywhere near my bod. All the brujo wants to do is sacrifice a chicken to his primitive jungle god, and that’s not going to do any further harm (except to the chicken). The MD might frickin’ kill me. If I must go down to doc-in-the-box, I will have extensively researched the problem beforehand. “I’m presenting with thus and such. The appropriate therapeutics are X and Y. Please write me the scripts, NOW.”

            Even if you find a doctor who, for example would actually write up a prescription for ivermectin to treat covid, there’s a slim chance the pharmacy, at least the big-name pharmacy, would fill it.  That’s where we’re at now.  They’re controlled by the regime.

                I stopped at a small feed store, asked for Ivermection, she immediately asked if I wanted paste or injectible- then handed me three different brands to compare.
I got 2 tubes of edible paste and 2 bottles of liquid, $119.
The big places, Tractor Supply, Fleet ‘N’ Farm, are often cleaned out- but you can order online at their sites and pickup at the store.

            Just Rode the Rona last week.  Here’s what my doctor told me:
“Can’t see you because you tested positive.  There is no proscribed treatment for Covid 19.  Go home and isolate until you don’t have any more symptoms. Oh, you’re vaccinated, right?”
This, after 2 years.  Unbelievable.  Good reminder that doctors are highly trained technicians who follow a cookbook, not scientists.

                I once dated a woman who was a pharma rep. The things she talked about were mind-blowing to me at the time. Doctors, ultimately, follow a flowchart for diagnosis and treatment. That flowchart is for the most part the same sort of treatments that would have been prescribed 30 years ago (we figured out a lot of this stuff long ago). However, past that, it is heavily influenced by what reps are going through the door, how short their skirts are, and what “speaking gigs” they can give them. Doctors are not going home at night and reading scientific journals. They are not keeping up to date on cutting edge research and medicine. It is not what they do. So when the media trots out some MD to tell us that really this vax is super safe and necessary, he really is not to be trusted. The media is trading on an unearned reputation.Ultimately, keep in mind that even if a doctor really does have your best interests in mind, and even if he is incorruptible, he is ultimately reliant on the corrupted institutions like the FDA, CDC, and AMA to give him guidance. He faces very serious consequences for deviating from that and you know all those institutions have been looking for doctors telling his patients not to get vaxed.

                    Had a doctor buddy who made a point to read journals to keep abreast of changes in the field, but of course part of the unmasking of medical incompetence in Clown World is that these journals are only ever put together by “interested parties”.  It’d be like some GOP pol sitting down to read National Review for an “alternate viewpoint”.

                    All of what you say is true.  I’ve a spouse who was a pharma rep.  And yes, when age creeped up on her, she was “retired”.  Short skirts and tight asses rule.  But big pharma is not sexist, there were no shortage of “pretty boy” males in the ranks as well.  Everyone “selected” for this gig was an 8-10 on the hottie scale. And yes, my wife married down.  I ain’t no 8-10, perhaps a 5.Coming from an academic background I could not understand how a medical professional with even more time in school than I could be lectured to by what was in essence a low level sales person.  Boy, was I ever wrong.  Lazy bastards—all.However, one thing one has to remember is that if your physician fails to follow “best practices” as outlined by the hierarchy, he becomes subject to sanction and worse, lawsuit.  Not excusing his behavior—which should always be in your self interest, not his—just noting that it is all too easy to confuse the two.I have no solution.  You need to understand I suppose a bit about the subject (medicine) and have a sense for when you are being played by the doctor, but this is difficult for the average Joe.Whenever, I get readings from blood work and such that are not strictly in the norm (95% band) I simply ask “what happens if we leave well enough alone” or “what illness symptoms will I experience if we do nothing”?For example, not having a blood pressure within the new norm (120/70) will cause hardening of the arteries I am told.  So I said fine, let’s check for that condition.  One CAT scan later, all is pronounced “normal” for my age range.  Another person might have accepted a blood pressure prescription without question.  I win, big pharma loses.  Doctor doesn’t give a rat’s ass, he gets paid by me yearly, not by insurance policy.I have stated point blank that I will not accept “treating the numbers”, only direct pathology treatment.  So we never discuss getting the numbers into a range dictated by who knows whom, only what to look for when—and if—they produce a direct pathological effect. YMMV!

                ProZNoV:  “There is no prescribed treatment for Covid 19” because the government, big pharma, and Gates and Fauci have dictated that there be no treatment until you either get better, or you get so bad you can’t breathe.  At that point you go to the hospital, surrender your liberty to the ‘experts’ who ventilate you until you die.
And the handful of doctors who’ve shown some spine and genuine concern for the health of their patients are undergoing forced psych evaluations and/or losing their licenses.  When it’s a question of you versus their family’s financial security, the answer is foregone.

When at the hospital some time back for potential surgery, I had to sign a document acknowledging no pain medication will be prescribed for longer than 2 weeks (or 10 days, I forget) and if not in hospital, I would need to visit “their” hospital pharmacy to receive daily dosage of pain medication—but not to exceed the stated time limit!

            Well I am an MD and it brings me enormous heartache that this crisis will hurt the progress of medicine very substantially. The foundational basis of the Western medical tradition is what we call ‘evidence based medicine.’ The idea is sound, it is that there must be evidence that a treatment is effective. This is one of two reasons why there are clinical trials. The other important reason is to establish that a treatment is safe. In what may seem a morbid sense of humor, to explain why this is important I sometimes tell people that killing cancer cells is absolutely no problem. Cyanide does it wonderfully effectively. But people understand why that’s not a solution to oncology. Likewise, decapitation cures all headaches. And these illustrate exactly why one of the central commandments of the Hippocratic Oath are ‘first, do no harm.’ Medical therapeautics involve, to name a few things, sawing into people’s chests to cut their hearts, drilling into skulls to pick around in the brain and to introduce by various methods highly potent chemicals into the body. This is really dangerous sh*t when you pause to think about it. Hence ‘first, do no harm.’ We need to know what the heck we’re messing with here.Now what have my wonderful colleagues done in regard to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine? They have dispensed with the need to establish the basic safety of a very radical new medical technology, mRNA therapy (which is not, by current knowledge, ‘gene therapy’ but that’s assuming both that there is no reverse transciptase enzyme in the vaxx (guess one rumor thus regarding I’ve heard at least twice now) and that we know how it really works. Prions violated the ‘central dogma of molecular biology’ when they suddenly jumped out).They are also pushing for active therapeautics where there is no or very insufficient indication. I am here thinking of vaccinating children from Covid. Again, this needs to be seen in the context of being a very new technology. I am NOT indicting all vaccines, I’ve received plenty of vaccines, for yellow fever and what not. But these are old technologies and we have a fairly good idea of the risks of complications here. Prescribing a novel techology therapy on very weak indication is in my opinion, very, very shabby clinical practice. Yet, almost all my colleagues gingerly went along. I at first did too. Then I started reading.I am also astonished, now having read up on virology a little (this is not my clinical or research field) that ‘serious people’ could suggest or even believe that we could eradicate an RNA virus with hastely prepared vaccines (RNA, and retro, viruses mutate far more than DNA viruses because RNA is a less stable molecule than DNA; this is presumably why nature has selected for DNA to be the carrier of inheritied genetic information). You do not kill RNA viruses with immunization in this way and influenza and HIV are the prime RNA and retro virus examples of this, respectively.I am also repeatedly frustrated by the obfuscation and what must be disinformation, floating around in the professional medical literature on Covid. I sometimes resort to ‘dissident’ information to help gain a better picture of what is going on with the vaxx, exactly because the ‘professional’ literature is entirely confused and, a picture slowly emerging, some of it intended to be be misleading. Who have written the oceans of papers and labels and bulletins since this began? Judging by the (correct) use of scientific terminology and description of highly complicated molecular biology and biochemistry involved, it must clearly have been physicians or other biomedical experts. Just like you can’t get a literature major to deceive mathematicians about a math paper, much of the professional stuff was written by people who know about biomedical science. They probably believe much of it themselves but they make claims that I believe to be on shaky ground.Finally, doctors being predisposed to being very concerned with their reputation and ‘good standing’ with their colleagues, have begun witch hunts and ‘tinfoil’ accusations against those of us who are questioning what is going on. This turning on the ‘dissident colleague’ is ugly in the extreme and we all know that we are risking our careers, future jobs, future grants and funding etc. to question the narrative. Who the hell told these automaton dimwits that science even HAS a ‘narrative’. That is exactly what it is NOT supposed to have. A paradigm sure. A narrative?? Hell no! Nature is supposed to be our ‘narrative.’ Or, whatever it is we are doing, is NOT science!It is not entirely painless to concede that I am disappointed in my profession and in the majority of my colleagues. There will be much rebuilding to do at some point.

                    I do not know if it has any effect here. Ivermectin blocks a molecular pathway that some viruses use to replicate and if SARS-CoV-2 uses this pathway, maybe it has effect. I don’t know if it does.
It is a valid subject for a clinical trial I think. There have been some small studies and they are being disputed and discussed left and right. If it has effect it should NOT be used prophylactically (preventatively) because we would have resistance in no time flat. It should instead be used for the critically ill.

                    I wrote a reply a little while back, may be stuck in the spam filter?? Basically I don’t know that ivermectin has effect on SARS-CoV-2. It targets a molecular pathway that some viruses use to replicate and if the Covid virus is one of them it could have effect. It seems a valid subject for clinical trials. There have been some and there are many and long papers arguing for or against the results and conclusions. Currently there appear to be disinformation campaigns from both sides regarding ivermectin.If it does work I think it should not be used prophylactically because that would produce resistance in no time. It should instead be used for critically ill patients.

                    That’s quite alright, I’m rather angry at some doctors’ behavior over the last 24 months myself. But it is not entirely true what you are saying, medicine has seen significant improvement over the last 100 or so years. Ironically infectious medicine is probably the single greatest success story. Bacterial infections such as TB, sepsis (‘blood poisoning’) from innocuous scratches, stuff that many used to die from prematurely, were almost beaten down towards the end of the 20th century. This is no small thing. Sadly, we are now seeing a partial comeback of ‘consumption’ as TB was once called and other diseases, due to drug resistance. We’ve also become a lot better at dealing with heart and kidney disease.But corruption, careerism, bloated egos and other things are also coming home to roost. Western decadence has evidently not left medicine untouched and there will be a price to pay.

                        Thank you, Moran, no clinical experience of any kind.
Below I asked, asking again –
If anthrax is bacteriological, why did our soldiers receive…a vaccine?
Aren’t vaccines a prophylaxis for viral infection, while bacteria require post-infection treatment?

                        There are plenty of vaccines for bacterial diseases as well, e.g. pertusses (whooping cough), tetanus etc. They probably give the anthrax vaccine in the army b/c they are afraid of potential bioweapons. It’s not usually given to the civilian population so that may be why(??)

                I have been amazed at how easy it was for the medical establishment to be steered into debasement. There are many concrete assertions made around the covid panic by the establishment that are easily falsifiable by layman able to review scientific papers, never mind a doctor of medicine. Doctors know these official assertions are false, they know the measures being prescribed are ineffectual at best. It’s as if some NASA political appointee decreed that if everyone puts their pants on backwards the orbits of the planets will reverse direction and all the worlds astronomers and astrophysicists went along with it publicly. Our situation is worse of course because the prescriptions of the high placed political appointees are doing actual harm. The primitive superstition, the comically transparent scapegoating of unbelievers for the failures of the prophets, it is a monumental disaster for the credibility of medicine.

                Let’s not forget, not long ago doctors performed lobotomies, insulin shock therapy, and electroshock therapy. Doctors hack 1 million live babies a year into hash because this is supposedly a “constitutional right.” Doctors cut men’s penises off and administer hormones for the men to grow breast tissue. Doctors approved and prescribed Thalidomide, Vioxx and Oxycontin.
The corruption of medicine is not a recent phenomenon…

                Moran, as I posted awhile ago. Doctors are *not* scientists, they are (in the main) “technicians”.  Wife told me that, and then told me to shut up about it.  As I think upon it, she’s spot on, and we should not expect much more from the medical rank and file.

                    Hehe, for most clinically active doctors I would agree. Now there is no faster way to flatter a clinician than to call him a ‘scientist.’ But most of them, just like most engineers or state park biologists etc. don’t do science as in serious research.You also see this in the medical school curriculum. They gradually transitioned to ‘problem based’, later ‘integrated’, learning, away from the more traditional approach of pathology, pharmacology, microbiology etc. and then used recidencies to learn to put that together, under the supervision of attendings.This has gone hand in hand with more and more medical students being female (and most of the males being effeminate). Since groups regress towards the stereotypical mean, in the future we can look forward to physicians who are better at sym- and empathizing with you. But a whole lot worse at critical thinking and hard decision making.All those girls in med school today should, in a saner time, have gone to nursing school. They will be wonderful ‘advanced nurses with prescription pads.’ So, if I’m doxxed, I’m probably out of a job and today I probably wrote too much about what I do (there aren’t THAT many dissident docs). Oh to hell with this system.

                        Well, given that most everything heals itself a high percentage of the time (oldsters excluded), I can see where the feminine hysteric desires a good cry and a hug, rather than physical treatment or simply being told “You’re fine!”  Guys are probably getting that way as you’ve noted as well.However, since I don’t give a crap about bedside manner, it’s a real pain in the ass to have to research every damn thing before I get to the doctors office for a consult and perhaps a prescription.Have not yet requested an Ivermectin prescription.  As pointed out here, it is easily available from the Indians on the Internet, but they require the official prescription to be attached to request and payment.  From reviews the company is honest, but they ship from India.

            Severian:  I’ve operated on the basis of “highly skeptical of doctors” for years – primarily due to being a parent.  Growing up I had the usual (colds, flu, chickenpox, broken bone or two) but no chronic illness or long-standing disability.  My kids were both pretty healthy as well – but I learned that each had his own illness tendencies and reactions, whereas doctors always wanted to go by the book.  After the first few times, I knew when someone had an ear infection and spent money proving the doctor wrong.  I learned a fever always caused massive digestive disruptions for one son as the docs blithely prescribed expensive medications he repeatedly vomited up.My kids were then prompted, before we ever left the house, which symptoms to recite and which dates to use (feeling ‘x’ for ‘y’ days =  prescription ‘z’) so we essentially diagnosed our own illnesses and treatments.  The doctor’s visit and fee was the necessary toll paid to get the prescription.  My view on this hasn’t changed in years, and so when the scamdemic began I just shook my head and sat back to watch the predictable panic.

        We have a  problem where idiots are deciding who the experts are and which experts should be demonized, censored and banned.  Dr. Fauci is seen as an expert and giants in their field, like Dr. Peter McCullough, Dr. Robert Malone, Dr. Michael Yeadon and many more are cancelled by the “Fact-Checkers” on mainstream media sites.  There are plenty of experts out there, it’s just that they may not fall in line with what the regime is imposing on us.

                    While he is certainly a brave guy, there are also problems with Dr. Malone. For starters, while he probably is a first rate molecular biology scientist, he (or others) is somewhat inflating his credentials when it is claimed that ‘he invented mRNA therapy’. He didn’t single handedly. There were hundreds involved.
He is also now waltzing into other fields, such as mass psychology, where he has no particular expertise. Here he is just an intelligent person offering opinions. It’s going to take a while before we really find out what’s up and down in this whole mess.

                        I wondered about his phrase “mass formation psychosis.” If anything shouldn’t it be mass psychosis formation? Also, I’m not sure that believing the vax helps qualifies as “psychosis.”

                        When delving into human behavior explanations, we quickly leave “science” and enter the realm of opinion.  People are a tough nut to explain.  However, I give the concept and folks espousing such a bit of leeway.  Mass Formation Psychosis is as good an organizing explanation to begin to understand and discuss the phenomenon as any to date.

            It seems medical profiles are now resorting to political and judicial means to block the voice of colleagues disagreeing with them. That is just about as unscientific an approach as you can imagine. Many of the dissenters are probably wrong but let science, not legal means or big tech algorithms, sort that.

        “The core of the current crisis is that no one can honestly answer the question that is the basis of all human organization, who are we?”It’s a good question, and one that I started thinking about many years ago when it was already becoming apparent that my thoughts were massively deviating from the accepted norm. How can such a diverse (and not just racial diversity) society agree on anything? Much less thrive?It always seemed that the main things that would tear us apart were the standard two: race and religion. But it seems now that ruptures can develop between two people for the most trivial reasons: one is a vegan the other a vegetarian, one thinks that we should wear masks for the rest of our days and another doesn’t, The list goes on and on. And of course, Legacy MSM has a huge part to play.Perhaps a more pertinent question – on the local level – is “Are these my people?”. Maybe that’s the same sort of question, but I find myself asking it more and more of anyone that I meet. Are they ashamed of their history? Are they the same race as me? What do they think of home-schooling? Are they overly trusting in the government? Do they have a family? If so, how have they raised them? What is their opinion of multi-culturalism? Do they value God? Do they talk too much?The events of the last few years have made me realise that I am really on my own. Well, with the family. But that unit is on it’s own. And finding trustworthy associates is now a real challenge… a shame, because they’re sorely needed.

            Orange Frog:  Traditionally your excellent list of questions and concerns used to be eased by shared social customs and habits.  Even among kindred people various conflicts, both large and small, would always arise.  Local traditions and manners served to mitigate unnecessary conflict and smooth daily interactions.  That sense of public manners and courtesy was the first thing discarded by the left in the ’60s as “fake.”  Letting it all hang out, instead, was “keeping it real.”  So we lack even a local consensus on how to behave and what’s appropriate.  Add in the divisions of utterly alien religions and races, with not even the memory of shared history or traditions, and you’ve sown chaos.  I find it hard in the extreme to think that this was not by design.

            Heh. Just the title in the final URL posted is crazy. An army may come together to fight another army; i.e. a tangible enemy. But how exactly can ‘The Country’ do this against a virus.
It’s the meaningless rhetoric that is two-a-penny now, that is mimicked throughout other wings of government and business. With zero information content, window dressing for the plebs.

            Oh, yeah, and the Minimum Wage Priestesses in grocery stores performing the ceremonial purification of shopping cart *handles.* Never any other part of the cart; just the handles. I remain convinced that the evil spirits inhere only in the handle of shopping carts, and I know that because none of the Minimum Wage Priestesses ever performed the magical ablutions on cans of soup in the soup aisle, or packages of ground round in the meat market, and I finally realized that the particular evil spirit that causes the dreaded Covid-19 (“the invisible enemy”) cannot inhabit canned or shrink-wrapped goods.Which I regard as valuable knowledge.Science, indeed!https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48625/sonnet-to-science

                Superstitious behavior.  Here, they were sterilizing the shopping cart handles in the parking lot, in 110 degree sun!  The shopping cart handles being even too hot to handle without gloved hands.  Nothing, no virus known, could survive but for a few seconds.
At that point in 2020, I knew we were doomed.  The people were just too stupid, too cowed to deserve better than the scorn and abuse of their “elected” officials.
As the bully despises the coward, so those in power despise/abuse the compliant.

            &gt; What the whole idiotic farce has shown us–beyond any shadow of a doubt–is how staggeringly deep and broad *superstition* is in modern America and, indeed, in the whole world.
The swarmy “We Believe” lawn signs with the “Science is Real” and “All genders are real” slogans are baffling to your average person unless they realize they are not statements of reality, but magical incantations.  It’s so vapid it doesn’t even rise up to the level of articles of faith.  It’s primitive animism that is no different than the dance of a tribal witch doctor.

        Frankly I’m amazed it took this long — it’s a real testament to the power of bread and circumstances. For at least 40 years now, it has been a mantra that one must go to college to become an Expert Without Portfolio.Then one goes to college, and spends four, five, six plus years being told for a fact that there’s no such thing as a fact, that all “truth” is relative, and that everybody is where they are solely because of systemic this-and-that. Even though everything’s a social construction and nothing’s truly true, no one can ever be other than what they are, right now, forever, because at some time in the past some people did some things.Then one graduates, and is told that the sheepskin means one is now a Certified Expert, ready to handle whatever the world throws at you — what there is to know, you know it, and what you don’t know isn’t knowledge, for you have (just barely) passed college.How did we even make it out of the 1980s without some dumbass accidentallysittingon The Button?

        Robert Kennedy jr. wrote a book, The real Anthony Fauci. I need to read that. I assumed it was about Covid, gain of function research (deliberately making vira more morbid (dangerous), infectious or adopting them to a new host, in short the first genuine equivalent to nuclear weapons from the science of biology as opposed to physics).But it seems the first 200 or so pages are about HIV and the conjecture that there is no causal link between HIV and AIDS. I had NEVER heard of this conjecture in med school or later in hospitals or in research. Now, I am a lot more open to ‘tin foil’ ideas, in various areas, than I was two years ago. I am much more ready to say ‘bring forth the evidence and let’s just look at it and forget everything we think we know about why this can’t be.’ This is the effect of having been lied to repeatedly by ‘authorities’, both legal and professional.Still, this one, about HIV and AIDS I cannot believe. And I really want it to be wrong (I am also convinced it is. But the point that I am trying now to suspent pre-conceived notions of what is true and what is nonsense, which is actually hard).IF, should it be, true – which I still do not believe – then everything you learn studying biological sciences, is now cast into doubt. Imagine everything you read in science or engineering now has to be established from first principles and personal observations. That is the death of science, we are back to Galilei, maybe early electromagnetism (have fun deriving Maxwell’s equations…) When I read that fairly serious people are now entertaining the ‘HIV has nothing to do with AIDS’ conjecture (and that RFK jr.’s book is said to be full of references), it was like the floor opened up beneath me and below was only the abyss of ignorance. I need to get that book, I am convinced it is wrong here. And I fervently hope so.

            Please, don’t fret.  You need not reinvent the wheel.
Just do with HIV what has not yet been done with covid: isolate the virus and make samples available.
I don’t think either is a complete fiction;  I say they don’t want anyone to see what the bioweapons boyz been up to.

                    Forgive my abuse of comment space, but, in line with today’s, there were 5 research directions, 4 seemed to strengthen HIV lethality, one weakened it, so that was the one defunded and shut down.I’m surprised you’ve never heard of the original controversy, the ‘connection’ controversy.By root etc. I meant “descriptor”.(A D- minus grade just to allow me to graduate high school is the extent of my schooling, as everybody here can tell.

                        I honestly do not recall anyone questioning the link between HIV and AIDS. That was taken as a given, as firmly established knowledge. It is the equivalent of questioning the link between hypertension and cardiovascular disease or stroke. If such a link is severed we are sent spiralling back to square one in the relevant field. And must be suspicious of similar ‘foundational rocks’ crumbling beneath our feet. That is why I profoundly hope the HIV-AIDS link remains.I have of course heard of various ‘wild’ theories about HIV being introduced deliberately etc. But the technology was just there to do that in the late 1970s. Don’t forget, DNA technology, while certainly established as a science, was still in its infancy as technology back then.

                hehe anthrax is a bacterial, not viral, infection. The reason it is so ‘popular’ as a bioweapon is that the anthrax bacterium produces particularly robust spores. Spores are a metabolically inactive form of a bacterium, sort of similar to seed corns. I believe they’ve found infectious anthrax spores among Ancient Egyptian mummies. Something so robust, just waiting for you to add a little saline for it to ‘wake up’, is clearly a potential bioweapon. Except for that anthrax is a very different problem compared to Covid.

                    Ah, bacterial.  No wonder it’s so common.  Basque ranchers usually have numerous small scars on their arms from it.
Wait a minute.No wonder those ranchers don’t get vaccinated for anthrax, who ever heard of that?
Yet…our soldiers received a ‘vaccine’.A brand-new diagnosis, PTSD, was invented just in time for the FDA to approve Zoloft for its treatment.
Help me here, Doc Simba.If anthrax is bacteriological, why did the soldiers receive a ‘vaccine’?Doesn’t bacteria require treatment, not prophylaxis?

                        Vaccines are not just for viruses.  You can produce antibodies for any number of diseases.  However, we have (had) antibiotics for many bacteria infections in the past. But I am no expert in this matter to be sure.

            &gt; IF, should it be, true – which I still do not believe – then everything you learn studying biological sciences, is now cast into doubt.The insane lies of the mental health profession brought the entire medical field in doubt for me.  I had a new doctor tell me, with no self-awareness to how insane he sounded, that if you’re not pretty much over a parent dying in 6-8 weeks, you probably have a chemical imbalance and should consider anti-depressants.While there is a small percentage of people who react positively to medical treatment, anyone that separated from the human experience is not capable of being a good judge of action in pretty much anything.

                The mental health fields have been in deep trouble for decades. Psychiatry became too obsessed with neurochemistry and clinical psychology took the Kool Aid on Freud and all that nonsense.Some fields of medicine have seen real and incredible progress over the 20th century. Infectious medicine and cardiology/heart surgery are two important examples. Other fields such as oncology have had real but far lesser successes and less impressive overall gains and some, such as neurology, are still largely confined to diagnostics and supportive care for too many of their ailments. Progess has been real but very unevenly distributed across the various medical fields.

            You are brave to flip the switch which possibly removes the floor of assumptions beneath your feet. My salute to you, sir. The most painful experiences, besides the obvious big ones (death of a loved one, natural disasters, etc) are the deaths of beliefs, hopes, wishes. In addition to the RFK book, a few people are beginning to find “Inventing The AIDS Virus” by Peter Duesberg. And a few of those are beginning to uncover names like Antoine Bechamp and Gaston Naessens, to name only two. The rabbit hole goes very deep indeed.

        “Now we are a people wondering if there is such a thing as experts at all”.I am one of the people no longer wondering.  I am sure experts do in fact exist, but said expertise will be disregarded, discounted, disparaged, denigrated, defamed, or otherwise denied in the great cause of Equity – and ironically under the banner of Science.  At least this is so in the realm of politics.  Whether actual expertise continues to be permitted in other realms of endeavor and for how long remains to be seen.

        One other, very visible failure of the managerial experts you didn’t mention is our southern border.
The fact that the rulers are unable and/or unwilling to solve that issue severely challenges their legitimacy to at least a significant portion of the population.
Of course, the results are quite possibly, maybe even likely, the exact desire of the so-called experts.

            The southern border could be closed in a few days, IF the G decided to do something about it,OR got out of the way.One would be take the troops stationed in Europe and lace them shoulder to shoulder on the border. Shoot to kill anyone trying to cross. Problem solved after the first few kills.Two, would be to let the landowners take care of business and not interfere with the owners protecting their property.If a burglar was coming in your window, would you just let him in? I think not. Yet that’s exactly what is happening on the border.If anyone thinks my ideas are draconian, fear not. In the event of a societal collapse, it will be much, much worse.

        Our society has become too degraded in the past few decades for there to be any real semblance of cohesiveness anymore.  We’re now just a jumble of competing groups who all want their say in how things get done.  When some pajeet, jogger, muzzie, jew or beaner is opining on this policy, or that policy, it’s obvious we’re done.  How people like those came to be in a position of influence or power in the American public sphere is pretty much all we need to know about where things now stand.  The sad thing is former vast majority Whites were largely complicit in allowing this to happen and now all that remains is to see how bad it gets – and it’s probably going to get really bad, with the never ending, idiotic covid shenanigans leading the way.

            Industry capture seems to have affected all institutions in the West where the regulatory agencies are now owned by who they’re supposed to regulate. It’s very visible in the pharmaceutical industries and the CDC and FDA. They just trade all their executives back and forth. All our politicians have gotten rich in office. The media tells the people what to do at the behest of their masters. The Vatican which can be thought of the regulatory agency for Satan is now almost entirely in his power. What a time to be alive!

            While your point may be accurate, it is also a bit spergy. It ultimately matters not whether one classifies the U.S. as a “representative Constitutional republic” or a “democracy” or whatever else; like all governments before and after it, the U.S. is an OLIGARCHY. Any state of even moderate size will be run by elites. The notion that “the people” call the shots is just part of the civic mythology, i.e. the propaganda, designed to help the civilization plug along. The real question is this: Will the elites who control a given state practice some form of noblesse oblige? It certainly doesn’t appear so in the case of today’s United States.

                “The real question is this: Will the elites who control a given state practice some form of noblesse oblige? It certainly doesn’t appear so in the case of today’s United States.”Because our elite is an artificial elite; a contrived elite; and ersatz elite; a make-believe elite. My grandmother would have called them “jumped up.”They are not an organic elite. They didn’t grow or arise out of a given culture and set of historical circs. They were “decided upon” by this childish faith in “experts.” It’s a real problem. Zman’s article today is one of the most insightful of ’em all. Anyway, that’s why there’s no semblance of noblesse oblige. The whole thing’s fake.

The current administration hasn’t the will or a clue to do what is necessary to get back on track. The gods will reward them and us if more diversity and anti-racism is implemented. Even that smarmy fudge packer in charge of transportation is all in on racist overpasses blocking teams of black bus riders.
Nothing good will ever come from these retarded incompetents. Look at LA and the looted trains.

We did that in NYC nearly two years ago, at the beginning of the craziness.  There was a field hospital of tents put up in Central  Park; there was a repurposed hospital ship in the harbor for a month or so.  Tents are great! (sarc) .. what sick person wouldn’t want to live outdoors in the cold rainy springtime?  And the hospital ship treated a grand total of ..TEN PATIENTS!  before  it became superfluos.

                Hell, MSI re-released the GT 730 because of the shortages. Entry-to-mid range GPUs gamers would scoff as they upgraded for a few more FPS are hugely inflated. I put myself on the list for a MSI’s RTX 3090 Ti Suprim X but I don’t think I’ll see it for months.

                The lead time to design high volume products is many years. You don’t make changes to running designs until you can secure a delivery schedule for those alternate ICs. Even the low volume scientific instruments I design have become a nightmare to get built by the dozen. An of course you have to spin a new PCB too…

Putiing a stake in the heart of those techno-utopian bullet points is why the chip shortage will prove to be a good thing long-term.

            In a competent country, something like a chip shortage would trigger a national security crisis and plans to fund multiple plants would be debated in Congress within a week.
But no, let’s depend on a defenseless island country adjacent to our main economic rival.

                I’m again reminded of all the discussions from 2 years ago, which posited that the Holocough would be the impetus for large-scale repatriation of manufacturing to our shores.  That talk got squashed quicker than the notion of using HCQ or ivermectin to treat the coof.  Who gave that order?

        I think they’re probably are people that know things and could probably solve some problems in the ruling class but the maliciousness of these people and how much they hate us cannot be underestimated so it doesn’t matter how much they know or what they can do or what they don’t know. That’s all that really matters.And this is amazing. The insurance companies are going to see all this first. Now the question is will the billionaire class throw money at them to get them to look the other way?  I don’t know? do they have enough money to do that?https://freewestmedia.com/2022/01/14/life-insurer-refuses-to-cover-vaccine-death/

                    We may be referencing different cases. I assumed the article you linked was about the French billionaire who took out life insurance for his kids and grandkids.
He passed away, and the cause of death was listed as, wait for it, The Jab.
Insurer said, not so fast. He wasn’t forced to take an experimental drug. And doing so, amounted to suicide.
No payout for you!
The courts have so far agreed.
If I am referencing a different article, I apologize.
