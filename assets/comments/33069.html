        What term should be used for a person who likes Jerry Seinfeld, Sandy Koufax and Susanna Hoffs and has Jewish friends in their life, but also despises the fact that elite Jews hold incredible disproportionate power and influence over Western society and seek to silence those who point it out and question it, and also work furiously to drown White countries with Third World people?
“Antisemite” just doesn’t cut it.  A new term is needed.

            This is just normal thinking in Christian society for about 1500 years or so. Remember that these terms are used to define you. Like Z points out, nobody is really a “white supremacist” the way people talk about it, or even a “White nationalist.” Very few people they call “antisemites” have problems with Jews on an individual level, and even are acquainted with or friendly to Jews in their professional and personal life. Most people they call “transphobic” actually have a lot of sympathy for people who declare themselves transgender and understand this is a bad road they’re going down. Most people they call “homophobes” object to the hedonist lifestyle they live and understand how dangerous it is both for them and society (“gay liberation” got going in the 1970s and by the 1980s we saw the consequences of it).But for decades, conservacucks were so afraid of getting called this that they just bended the knee every time. I think this new generation doesn’t really care, and understands that these are labels that people apply to you as a means of control. This is even true of the term “white”, as E. Michael Jones has explained ad nauseum, at the cost of chunks of his audience. And while I think EMJ goes too far with it, I think at the core he is correct. They (A) define white as bad through a CRT lens, (B) wait until you call yourself “white”, then (C) destroy you. This was the framing of the struggle sessions of the first Trump admin and especially post-Floyd riots.

            Is this a struggle for national self-determination or not?If it is, then “loser” is the first term that springs to mind. I say this not unkindly, but merely as a statement of fact.If it is not, then this whole thing is a waste of time comparable to a Trekkie convention, so why bother to care?As for “anti-Semite”, I think that people who claim to be white advocates but use anti-white terminology are also losers.  People like Anglin and Fuentes may behave like counterproductive punks or worse, but calling them anti-Semites is a form of anti-white collaboration.The same goes for people who claim to be dissident white advocates but include Semites in their plans and meetings.Such people dissent from nothing but logic, reason, commonsense, existing reality and the historical record.  They set up themselves, and the nation, for failure.I used to think such people were either cowards or compromised.  But now I understand that it simply takes a certain level of intelligence, combined with stubborn arrogance and selfishness, not to see this fight for what it is.  Unfortunately these are some of the same qualities that send people down the trail in the first place.But it also comes with being born before, or having lived past, a certain age.  There is no fool like an old fool, and this thing is full of old fools who never understood what they were about and who need to get out of the way.

                Was right with you at the start. Not sure where the logic went awry, but might want to check your math. I think you probably dropped a sign somewhere.The first step has to be identification of the problem. One who sees Jews as a problem obviously must have identified some specific action that he wanted to do, but was prevented from doing so by inherently Jewish action(s). I doubt most people can point to even one such, but I would be happy to be proven wrong.Personally, I think Islam is a far greater threat than anything else we face, and I despise The Chimp for all the people he tricked into calling it the religion of peace. In what world? To say such a thing is to have no knowledge at all of Moorish Iberia, or the Ottoman Empire. Or north Africa. Gates of Vienna. What have you heard from the Sasanians lately? The head-choppers are the enemy, to this day, and, while Jews may not be your cup of tea, who else is even trying to do anything to keep them in check? Heck, the establishment is doing its best to turn the West into a caliphate.

                    The Western countries all suffer from having a small “kernel” of anti-White Jews and a much larger pool of elite anti-White Whites. The Jews provide money and organization, the smug “elite” anti-White Whites provide the legwork and man(really woman)-power to staff all the NGOs, government agencies, and corporate HR departments that work tirelessly for the destruction of our civilization. The AWW’s get out of bed, kiss their gay, tranny husbowives and start thinking “what can I do today to hurt people who look like me?”. Sometimes I really wonder if there’s any hope for such degenerate and self destructive societies at all. The task of just getting back to having normal, non-traitorous White people in charge itself seems monumental. Perhaps the re-Trumpening is a movement that way but I know better than to be hopeful.As for the Muslims, yes, they are and have been “the enemy at the gates”. The real problem, and why the West is succumbing to Islamization, is the enemyinsidethe gates who have money, status, and power, and are actually supposedly our protectors. A society infested with traitors can’t fight off an army of girl scouts, much less devout, fearless Jihaddis.

                        Agreed, to an extent. Yes, AWJs persuade AWWs to betray their own. But I don’t believe if we decided to deal with the AWWs as they should be dealt with, that the AWJs would help, or even shed a tear. And I’m not sure the AWWs actually need the AWJs to hate us.

            “Normal and not retarded”? Seinfeld is hilarious. Jews are great at assessing a situation and capitalizing upon it (see Punk and Glam Rock – I love Marc Bolan). At the same time, one must recognize that capitalizing upon situations in our modern world means a race to the bottom (see Punk and Glam Rock). And, certainly, we then arrive at the cusp of the global Svengali.

            Anyone who’s not a retard or a liar is some level of antisemite/”antisemite.” The term’s rarely conversationally useful. You don’t call people “omnivores” unless you’re talking about diets.As noted, what it really signifies is that Jews hate you, and they hate almost everybody. They hate Trump more than Hitler—because it’s not at all about others’ attitude toward *them*. Trump’s love makes them even angrier. So does yours. Seinfeld-posting will get moved up the ADL’s hit list. Ass-kissing every Jew on earth got Trump *negative* votes—and shot in the face.“Taking it back” might be worthwhile, to re-establish that being pro- or anti-Jew isn’t a moral question, if you think you can do that. They’re anti-you. Do you reciprocate? “Never relax?” Be a traitor (Christian)? Always remember who you’re talking to. Putting ANTISEMITE on your business card isn’t telling the truth about yourself.Z typically limits the term to the guys who talk about almost nothing but Jews. Z’s talking to *us*, so we know what he means. I use “JQ enthusiasts” instead, to emphasize that what defines them isn’t being antisemites. It’s being dorks. They never say anything we all don’t already know. Who ever *learned anything* from, e.g., Devon Stack’s anti-Trump shows? It’s just some nerd yelling at you—not at the Jews, at *you*—the same thing a hundred times.Just don’t do that. And you probably shouldn’tcall *yourself* anything. And if you have to add caveats, what you’re saying is wrong.

                No. This was ancient Israelites.
Jews are only the descendants of Pharisees and their religion is the Talmud. They did not produced Jesus, but they were and are his enemies. They did not write the Bible but the Talmud.

                        You are probably right. At least I know of no reason to believe you are wrong. I mean, I guess it’s possible that modern translations of the Septuagint are in error, or that the Septuagint is not an accurate representation of scripture, but I know of no credible arguments to that effect.
I think the Talmudic jews have gone astray, though.You have to deal with things as they are. From a Christian POV, those who deny Jesus as God are objectively wrong.

Properly understood, Christianity is the rejection of Judaism.

            “What term should be used for a person who likes Jerry Seinfeld, Sandy Koufax and Susanna Hoffs and has Jewish friends in their life, but also despises the fact that elite Jews hold incredible disproportionate power and influence”?
How about an “American”?

            I am in the same boat. I like all those you mentioned, in addition to Adam Sandler and Allan Covert, but I don’t like that Jews like Soros and the others in the Israeli lobby and on Wall Street have an outsized say in the affairs of our nations.
I don’t hate them as a people. I just strongly dislike that too many of the usual suspects are behind the anti-white pogroms and other nonsense.

        The language has been so corrupted that I no longer care what labels are used or by whom.  They can call me notsee, hater, anti or phobic whatever, and I just chuckle.  I smile at the reaction if I call myself a fascist.  While ethno-nationalist is a term I’ve used, it doesn’t feel totally satisfactory.  Only thing that really matters is the friend/enemy distinction, and that is quite clear.  People who can’t/won’t call the other side ‘enemies’ are the ones who are confused, weak willed, and always willing to lose – regardless of label.

            When I’m online and get called a “racist”, “homophobe” or one of the other myriad leftist labels, I generally reply that they’re using the word as a stand in for “bad person” according to their moral code, and since I don’t share their morality I’m not in the least bothered by the charge.  At this point they either slink away or their firmware glitches and they continue to repeat the charge as if no response has been made (this also tracks with the feminine instinct to have the last word).  I only do it once, and move on.

                I give you credit for even engaging in the first place; I no longer bother or care.  Not trying to ‘convert’ anyone.  If anything I say (and I try to be careful in the real world) leaves someone looking upset, I know where they stand – and it’s not with me.  As I said, friend/enemy distinction.  Quite simple.

                    There’s wisdom in that.
As I said, I only say it once and then move on.  Not because I particularly care about what names I’m called, but because there’s likely to be someone observing the exchange who is ready to shed their anti-white programming and could use a small bit of encouragement.

        Linguistic balkanization is a good thing.  It allows people to form up to focus on common interests.  And there are many interests as there are personality types.  On my saltier days, I tend to break it down into control freaks vs. individualists.  The collapse of organized religion tracks to this breakdown because it has been consolidating the control freaks and driving out individualists for decades.Either you’re an economic unit owned by the authorities and you do what your told or you are a rational actor, you own you, and the purpose of “authority” is to simply keep the peace.Anyway, the breakdown of the language tracks with the collapse of the old orders.  A lot of the people thought to sit on the left side of the room (think Glen Greenwald) have migrated towards the individualists.  And a lot of the people thought to sit on the right side of the room have migrated over to the control freaks (think Liz Cheney).It’s been fun to watch and I was just the right age to notice the shift really pick up steam during Bush 43, predict who would switch sides, and then see my predictions validated.

        The demographic problem is fixable, we just need the political will.  It can be considered “fixed” without perfection.  Perfection is likely not possible, but fixing it is.  There are very few diverse people in the US who would be stateless if we revoked their citizenship, plus many millions are flat out illegal aliens with no citizenship to revoke.  Mexico has foreign birth citizenship.  Any kid born in the US of Mexican parents are Mexican.  The same is true of some other ethnic groups.These people walked here and they can walk home.  A large portion weren’t even born here and aren’t even citizens.  The idea that we are just stuck with them is false.  Africans (literal Africans, not AA) can be shipped home. Arabs can be shipped home.Some form of this is likely to happen to some degree with or without our planning it and doing it.  The empire has attracted people from all over the world who are only here because its the empire.  When the empire finally falls, a lot of these people are going to flee and be happy to be back home.  Money keeps them here. It’s not home. They’re surrounded by people unlike them.

        All these taxonomic classifications have been essential to Z man’s sweeping judgements of people in the opinion space in the past. Now he’s wondering if this taxonomy isn’t in fact misguided, or obsolete, or even stupid.Someone asked me once, “Can there be a nice Nazi?” That is question-begging. It means, can there be someone nice who became a Nazi?, or, can there be a Nazi who became nice?In our degraded age, Noel Coward is mainly remembered as a homosexual. At a guess, Coward would have described himself as a patriotic English playwright. The taxonomy is flipped. He’s remembered today as a homosexual.Everyday people (and yes, this includes a bunch of Harris/Walz types in my own neighorhood) are not “shitlibs” in the Joy Reid sense; they’re just people; misguided politically, yes, but they don’t plan to burn shit down because they didn’t get what they wanted this one time.It is a sign of serious decay in society when people are tagged with their political and sexual preferences.

            It was a great term, but it was easy to anathematize. I think the issue with labels is they need to be fixed. Marxism can be debated, but only within the framework Karl Marx. Libertarianism can be stretched in every direction because it is not tied to a specific person and his ideas.

                    I agree with you. I’d add Rothbard with a big exclamation point, too.
But @Zman’s argues (rightly, IMO) that right-libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism are no more than a tiny splinter of a splinter, while the left-libertarians, playing on sloppy emotionalism rather than logic and reason, are much more appealing.
In today’s world, one cannot really discuss things like, for instance, the effects of tariffs, but rather only how they make one feel.

                When “alt right” was undefined and signified something like “all the anti-leftists who aren’t conservatives,” it was a useful term for us, a handshake across a lot of borders.
When it was made to mean “Richard Spencer and people who obey him”—a list that’s proven stable, unfortunately—it was a useful term for *them*.

            That’s the problem, they keep stealing our terms. Kind of like how the Left defines everyone as “racist,” “denialist,” or “white supremacist.” Taking that last term literally, I have no problem with it. Whites should remain the majority in America, and in a democratic re public, we’d set policy. Doesn’t mean we’d have to go back to Jim Crow. Not that that would be an entirely bad thing. Blacks were actually better off in those days, I think.

                They did the same with discrimination. To discriminate, in the past, meant to be able to discern differences (e.g., a discriminating palate). The journey of this word to its modern anathemic use is the story of the Left’s control of the morality writ large.

        Hmmmmmm….I lost all use for labels with the dissolution of the old Alt Right.When fags like Milo, Spencer and Vox Day started schtumping under the label I started looking for better digs.I am not happy with the idea of abandoning the Dissident label to the faggotry and clowns as it sets a terrible precedent. If they are allowed to take possession of the labels then eventually they will take over any label you come up with. I get that Dissidents are uncomfortable with policing their own ranks; lest the wrong people do the policing – which to me is what went wrong with the Alt Right. They had a lot of good ideas but they got washed away by entryist clowns. Like everything else, they succumbed to people problems, not ideological ones. I personally parted ways with the old Alt Right as a result of personality clashes more so than ideological ones.To me the Dissident is the disaffected conservative that THINKS. When I landed here I was greeted by a hail of rotten vegetables and froots thrown by angry conservatives but they also took time to listen to me and some were patient enough to take the time to explain Dissident thought thought process. And perhaps that is the appeal of the movement – the willingness to entertain the newbs and reason with them. All I ever got from the Alt Right was contemptuous dismissal by the cool kids – who werem more often than not – idiots and clowns.I am not here seeking a label or a group of cool kids to hang with, I am looking for intelligent men and women that reason and use logic. Not trying to slag our esteemed Blog Host – but the comments are as good and sometimes even better than Z at times. Call it whatever you want, Z – I am here for the long haul and appreciate your sanity in this world of madness.Have yourselves a great weekend fellas – and keep doing what you do.

                I worry that people might think that “Z” stands for “Zelensky”.  Also, I think there was some trouble a few years ago with “Z” being banned in European countries because it was supposed to have some connection with Russia’s battles in Ukraine.

        One of the things that use to drive me crazy, was when people found out how much I hated the Democrats and their agenda, they would call me a Republican.  Whoa.
That seems to have declined as many people have come to realize that the Republican Party is as much a part of the problem as the Democrats.
In some sense MAGA or Trump Voter is an improvement in that it captures the anti-establishment vibe of folks like me.

        On the small business quip here is an interesting one. Theil is clearly a major force behind this attempt to reform the GAE. Yet his big thing is how competition is for losers. Why? It doesn’t scoop up all of the money in the room and lead to unfathomable profits.
How is that any different than the current GAE? Where is the impulse to reform?

            Theil is unquestionably correct, based on the current situation. Government power is being used to create winners and losers in business, and everything else, for that matter.
It’s not a huge deal for Theil if government were defanged, and could no longer make or break peaceful people of the wrong persuasion. He’s already got his, and, from his POV, would prefer not to be broken. That may be his entire calculus, pure self-interest, but if it aligns with mine and every other producer’s, I’m not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.

        As for labels and political axes, the only one that seems to matter anymore is the divide between masculine and feminine ways of thinking and organizing society. On the masculine side you have honor, dignity, freedom for the individual, property rights, law and order, science and reason, love for God and fellow man. Then on the feminine side you have…the opposites of all that. Basically you have the spiral into nihilistic chaos, darkness, and extinction. We’re about 2/3 of the way down that slide to hell now.

        Somewhat OT or perhaps not “Morgoth” on substack (a very English gentleman) believes the UK will become a Woke North Korea as much of Europe and the US puts away the woke.Interestingly, Canada’s Trudeau enthusiastically says he’ll arrest Bibi, as does the UK’s Starmer. International Lawfare relies on these people and the Thermidorean Reaction in the US will likely seek to remove them as the UK has now targeted Musk.The UK’s Parliament has “summoned” Musk to “explain” his “disinformation” on X. The next step is an arrest warrant for Musk and the US does have an extradition treaty. Meanwhile Musk has called Starmer a dude engaging in Holodomor Tactics in his war on UK farmers, as former Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson, Mr. Establishment, has emerged as a chief critic of Starmer. So clearly this is a coordinated attack by Obama / Starmer to get Musk sent to a British Jail while “Biden” is still nominally President.Of course Musk is the Avatar for much of the Defense Industry, as SpaceX provides nearly all the launch capacity in the US and no American competitor can match the capacity nor the cadence of SpaceX launches. Thus any arrest attempt will provoke the Defense Industry / Defense Dept to protect its asset. [If you think Musk just “bought” Twitter on a whim instead of Defense Dept. urging avoid bridge sales.]Musk / Trump / much of Wall Street / the auto industry / much of the Defense are aligned in what is likely realistic nationalism; the idea that a nation has enemies, must deter them, requires something more than just Color Revolutions and International Lawfare when it comes down to it. A lot of defense people are alarmed at how badly China has violated the Monroe Doctrine in Latin America and weakness does not invite admiration.

            It’s not hard to picture a day when most whites have fled the British Isles. Not exactly a visionary prediction, UK is already woke NK except for lacking a closed border, which would be fundamentally incompatible with wokeness. So the Anglos, unlike the Koreans, will have an easy way out (if anyone will take them).

            I can see Trump issuing an arrest warrant for Stamer for interfering in US elections. There’s a prima facie case given his Labour parties 200 paid “volunteers” in the US to help Harris.I think it would be a hoot.

        I always appreciate it when you mention Libertarians, it brings me back to my activist days. Man, what a circus that was! Everything from LGBT and swingers to White Nationalists. We were even talking to the Warren Jeffs people, didn’t realize what a bunch of scumballs they were. I guess I enjoyed hobnobbing with the weirdos which probably makes me a weirdo myself. BTW, these days I call myself a populist. It’s as good a label as any, I guess.

            Populist is a good word. Allows both the “left” and the “right” to identify themselves in relation to the regime. Lately I see more leftists, or former leftists, calling themselves populists. I identified myself as a populist sometime pre Trump, back when it was considered a positive word, then it became a bad word when he got elected, now it is becoming a good word again. The Satan Pope has denounced populism, so we know we are in the right for embracing it, both in word and deed.

        Why did the cucks allow the insane SJWs to rebrand themselves as woke?They absolutely hated and despised being called SJWs.  The term is dripping with sarcasm and ridicule.  Woke has no such effect on them. It’s their word. They love it.
Labels work both ways.  They re-label us with labels we hate.  SJW is the weapon of the right that White Supremacist or Racist is the weapon of the left.

They don’t call themselves “anti-white,” for example. And conservatives get very angry at you if instead of accusing “the far left” of being The Real Racists doing anti-white (and, even more so, anti-Asian! look at this graph!) *racism*, you simply call them “anti-white.”Suspicious, eh?

        I’d label myself as an iconoclast.  I want to destroy every deleterious institution, policy and person who works against our interests whether they be on the ‘right’ or the ‘left’.  It’s a good all-encompassing term to describe my politics.

        somewhat OT: Blue Sky (conspiracy website mentioned in the podcast). And we now have Mt. Blue Sky (formerly Mt. Evans) the big mountain west of Denver. They changed the name in 2023 but I didn’t hear about it until this year. They claim it was what the indians called it but I never heard that before. And who made the decision to change the name? It’s all part of purging the past, the whole monuments business, imo. I have this suspicion it’s connected somehow to the weird murals at the Denver airport? We know there are underground labyrinths under that place as well stocked with goods and living arrangements. Something to think about, lol.

            They do this a lot, using “the Indians” as a diversion from the real agenda which is just cultural destruction. They pulled this trick with Mt. Mckinley, changing the name to Denali. I’d love to hear from any of the surviving native Americans if these retro-names are at all accurate or not. My suspicion is that a lot of them are just made up by White Karens and kooks. Then Goodwhites can make pilgrimages to these places and ostentatiously post pictures on Facebook using the new “correct” name. It’s just another way for the Clouds to flaunt their virtue online while humiliating the Dirt people and disparaging their rough and tumble ancestors who often risked their lives finding and mapping these places.

How vacuous, really.Make the missing remark!If a remark is remarkable, then make the remark. Otherwise you lied and the remark is unremarkable.

        Semantic confusion will continue because the establishment finds it useful to obfuscate differences, and hide their true affiliations and allegiances.
However, for better or worse we are on the cusp of a new socioeconomic order (the so-called “Fourth Turning”), which will inevitably create a different establishment, a different constitution (even if the meaningless text is retained), and different semantics.
Same confusion, though.

        We may be dissidents, but it connotes a limited vision. Is that what we aspire to be? Does that mean we don’t want to win? If we do win, then what are we?We need something that transcends the current moment.I like the term Occidental Man and the Occident. It is grounded in antiquity and reflects the view of who we are as a people and binds us to our ancient homelands using the language of our people into the mists of time.Occidental Traditionalists. Traditionalists for short.Of course, what is our tradition? Well, our tradition is Occidental Nobility. That is, for us nobility is not a caste or a class by title, but by action. Western man distinguished himself from other aristocratic orders/traditions by uniquely making it about action. There was a hereditary element, but it wasn’t solely hereditary. Everyone in our society has/had agency.A fatal mistake of the 20th century was adopting Universalism. It was easy to do. Occidental man dominated the globe with a civilization far more advanced than the rest of the world. So, when we described, “the world”, or “mankind” we were really describing ourselves as we straddled the globe. This led to a conceit and a flaw that then took that language and led us to open up our societies to anyone and everyone. These early 20th century conceits and flaws invited upon the Occident and its people invasion, loss of territory and the crisis we face today.I think right and left take the anti-Traditionalist framing. That came from the French showdown between the anti-Traditionalist egalitarians and the Ancien Regime – the feudal aristocracy.Of all the thinkers who has been most forward thinking in an attempt to put forth a vision, Guillame Faye has done this the most. Archeofuturism may not be the full, final vision, but it is a good first stab.Our task is to put forth a vision for the order we want to control and govern and live in as we move through demolishing the evil of the 20th century regime. So, we stand in a jungle with an immediate task of carving a path. We need to envision the other side. We can look to the past for inspiration, but we must formulate and express what we want as a future. As we move toward that vision we will be building the networks and patronage systems that entice and bolster the best of our people. As we strengthen we can extend patrimony to more of our people and be selective as they will be eager to join.A White homeland is not vision enough. It must be described in terms of the order itself and the benefits and aspirations it will be capable of realizing.We must move beyond conventional political thinking. Our civilization is being choked out by vicious and powerful people. We are not giving up on it, but the fight is both within existing politics and more and more in building our own thing in parallel and tactically and strategically supplanting FDR’s failing world civilization with our Occidental Imperium.As European people we all face the same struggle and plight. We will fight locally but over time our networks will have to extend across our continents to share and magnify our strengths and assets as we fight for our lands that are the physical and spiritual foundation or this new Imperium.I think we should call it The Fifth Occidental Imperium. The pre-Greek Aryans are the first. The Ancient Greeks the second. The Romans the third. Northwestern Europe the fourth.What we build next will be the fifth. Let me know how that sounds.

            In hindsight, 2016 was definitely the dog catching up to the car. But I think that in 2024 we have a much better picture of our enemy, their tactics, the scope and limits of influence that Trump can have in the White House, the path forward, and what can be done. As Z points out in his podcast, something as simple as pushing for a return of free association would be huge. Pete Quinones has talked about busting the myths of World War II and even something like that, just getting it into the consciousness, is enormous.

                The various Yamnaya descended Steppe Aryans. Their language, Proto-IndoEuropean is our mother tongue. They went into Western and Eastern Europe, Anatolia, Persia and into the Himalayas. The Egyptians also have their DNA so it is assumed they were the warrior priests of that empire for at least some portion of it as well.
Sanskrit and Latvian are the two closest languages to Proto-IndoEuropean. Latin and Greek are also direct descendants.
Hope that helps.

            I always liked “race realist” but certainly that term will scare the normies. My wife is the perfect barometer. She’s very conservative, but if she flips out, I know normie will flip out as well.

                “Realist” always has bad optics because it carries the connotation that you are part of the “truth” instead of one of those idealistic unicorn farts types.
White ethno-state? That ship has sailed. Anyone who claims to be a “realist” of any flavor needs to start with a frank admission of where we are, and a realistic path to a better future. Though it’s the path I took, since I don’t see a realistic way out, going Galt is no better answer for a race realist than it is for a libertarian.

                    White ethno-state is perhaps unachievable, but nonetheless an idealistic goal statement that lends itself to discussion of compromise or partial achievement.  I believe it’s been mentioned here as a possible (lessor) alternative to the ethno-state the return to “freedom of association” as once was the norm in the US during my early childhood.  Of course, that has largely been prohibited due to Federal legislation and SCOTUS decisions.

                        Freedom of association, sure. I think that’s possible. Bizzarely enough, probably because hispanics hate blacks. If we don’t screw this up (like we tend to do) we can turn hispanics against blacks and have a smaller problem to deal with.

                    I do not see the realist label as having bad optics. Realism is based in truth. Like the obvious truth that men are men women are women. Race like the human condition are real things. Looks like it, smells like it, feels like it. It is what it is. Recognizing the truth does make you part of it. Optics aside realistic understanding of obvious or underlying truth is exactly that. Truth. Realism is based in truth. It is a foundation that gives us the proper understanding to know better. If an ethno-state pops up I’d think about it. Otherwise freedom of association should be enough. We are too diverse as a country to think otherwise. I’m all in for going Galt. If you can. If you can’t change it better to keep it at arms length or avoid it if at all possible. Some things cannot be changed. Better to know that instead of beating your head against a brick wall. Keep your head up and your helmet on. If we can keep the federal government from taxing us into oblivion, holding them to enumerated powers only and synthesize the empire down to be as small as necessary we could take a deep breath and progress from there. Fine tuning is a good thing. Move on to more important stuff. Whatever label we have it is constantly changing. I am a dissident. I am a realist. So I search for the truth. Finding it is a journey. It changes everyday. If the label Dissident Realist connotes negativity it does so only to the uninitiated. Those that do not understand things fully. So what? Self interest is not the same as selfishness. Viewing the world with dissident realism guiding my way works. For me. We are all figuring things out as we go along. Good luck to us all. Regardless, I still find Russian Supermodels wonderfully entertaining.

                        “Realism is based in truth.”
That’s begging the question. Is it, in fact, based on Truth?
Not just “truth”, as in whites are smarter or less prone to violence than blacks, but “Truth”?

                            Truth can be invisible to almost everything but honesty. Maybe it’s better said that Realism is based on honesty and that is what finds the truth. In all honesty Ukrainian Super Models are nonetheless Super Models.

                Race Realist is my go to as well.  However, it is not inclusive enough to span all beliefs that I hold—but for the big one and the most commonly discussed, it works very well.  I am not afraid to mention it to “Normies” either as the conversation dictates.  Basically all my (few, I admit) such discussions involve the pernicious concept of equalitarianism.  Oddly, few—if any—seem to disagree that we’ve got a lot of stupid and/or crazy people out there.  From there it’s a short trip to discussion of “groupings” of such stupid or insane people.

            Right now, can’t beat plain-old Nationalist. Ramzpaul used to say this was what he was, and I think it’s the best and snappiest label until something else comes along.You can be a civnat or WN. Christian Nationalist. Turkish Nationalist or Tibetan Nationalist. Quebec Nationalist. It can be broad or narrow. It’s vague, but with a bite: ALL peoples deserve a homeland. It is normie-friendly (Oooh, the Irish deserve their own country!”) and progressive-friendly (oooh, the Palestinians deserve their own country!”) yet repels progressives (Ooooh, white nationalism is Nazism!”) while forcing them to reveal their anti-white bias. It also removes the liberals and globalists, including Richard Spencer.

        The term “dissident right” is too non-specific to be used as a proper noun. The first one to employ it as a go-to for “our thing” was Greg Johnson (I missed that time Derb coined it) and he never meant it as anything else than a handy descriptor.I don’t know where Z’s fixation with giving it title status comes from. Aren’t the TRS guys, Amren, V-Dare, the crackpots at Unz, esoteric Hitlerists, asf. all on the right and all dissenting from some aspect of the current status quo?Of course they are, but Z wants to rob the English language of the most common descriptor for the above, capitalize it, and claim it as his own.

        Good show. The labels people put on have long been problematic. The basic problem is that what “Right” means to one person means something completely different to another person. This is exacerbated by the mass perfidy problem you discussed earlier this week.Very interesting ZMan. I had you for a person who supports mass deportation.Could you make a show about what it is you envision? Do you think we have a demographic problem? What is/are that/those problem(s)? What other problems does that create? What do you propose as the solutions assuming you and a faction you had on your side had full power to enact those solutions?I think this would be a great podcast.

        Canada does have a federal Green Party, and most of the provinces have one as well. They’re small, though in a few places they’ve ended up supporting a larger party in a minority government situation.  I think there’s a Green Party in the UK as well.

        The recent election of Donald Trump goes to show you that many people are against liberal policies, but have been voiceless in a media landscape that tilts overwhelmingly left. The public disenfranchisement of these men is striking when you consider how much money they have cumulatively to spend. How is it possible that left-wing ideology can trump the almighty dollar?We live in a world where reality is divorced from its presentation, as the mainstream media struggles to stretch the truth till it snaps. I find it amazing that Fox News even exists. If you didn’t know better, by watching TV you would assume 95 percent of the population was in favor of gun control and abortion and drapes the gay rainbow flag over their front lawn. Perception is everything in life and, saddled with an imperfect view of the world, we struggle to make sense of it all.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

                The exit poll diviners say hispanic males were close to even between Trump/Harris. And Trump also got the biggest share of negro males of any R since 1960. I think it’s just fewer of them being willing to vote for a woman president, and as soon as the Ds nominate another man (if they can bring themselves to) then they’ll go back to voting D. However, if the Ds can’t bring themselves to nominate another man, and I think that’s a real possibility, I don’t think they’re even capable of having a conversation with themselves about whether or not they should, then that keeps the door open for the Republicans in the future.

                In 2024, the “legacy, wealthy, masculine” unions backed out. The 2020 “deal” was: “We’ll make sure that ‘this thing goes Joe’, and youze cut it out with the weirdo shite.”
And TPTB proceeded to “ramp up the weirdo shite.” So THIS time…
And that relationship (legacy unions and Dems) will never again be as it was pre-2020.

                Black, female and heauxmeaux, yes. Hispanic, no. It’s really quite amazing that, even though there are quite a few more Messkins in America than Hutus, the former are almost totally absent from popular imagery compared to the latter. I imagine resentment of this fact is one thing that has pushed Hispanics rightward.

                    I read morons who sometimes claim that Shakespeare was a composite or someone else or whatever retarded modern theory. The bottom line is, When you read Shakespeare’s works, you get a consistent sense of the man behind the words. There is one man, and he is whoever wrote those words.Now, Z is no Shakespeare (who is?), but you definitely get a sense of the man behind the words. I don’t know what Z looks like or his bio, but I have the sense of the man. That is the ultimate AI detector. For reference, here is your query in ChatGPT (note that the substance is similar but the style is clear):“The term “dissident right” is a relatively recent addition to political discourse, marked by its deliberate vagueness and lack of a universally agreed-upon definition. At its core, it describes a spectrum of ideologies and movements on the right that reject mainstream conservative politics. However, the specific beliefs and priorities within this group vary widely, making it difficult to pin down its meaning. For some, the term signifies dissatisfaction with the perceived compromises and ineffectiveness of traditional conservative parties, particularly in addressing issues like immigration, national identity, and cultural preservation. Others see it as a rejection of globalism and neoliberal economic policies, favoring instead a return to localized or nationalistic approaches.This lack of clarity in definition is compounded by the diversity of thought within the dissident right. The label has been used to encompass everything from libertarians critical of government overreach to nationalists advocating for stricter immigration controls, and even more controversial ideologies that align with far-right or authoritarian tendencies. This ideological breadth makes the term a catch-all phrase rather than a precise descriptor. Critics argue that this vagueness allows harmful or extremist views to hide under the same umbrella as legitimate critiques of modern conservatism, leading to further conflation and misunderstanding.The ambiguous nature of the term also serves a strategic purpose for some of its adherents. By rejecting rigid labels, members of the dissident right can position themselves as outsiders or disruptors in a political landscape they view as stagnant or corrupt. This positioning appeals to those disillusioned with both mainstream right and left politics, creating a sense of identity rooted in opposition rather than coherent ideology. However, this fluidity also undermines the term’s utility in serious political analysis, as its meaning shifts depending on who uses it and in what context. As a result, the “dissident right” remains a polarizing and elusive concept, emblematic of the fragmentation and flux in contemporary political discourse.”To wit: You are damaged goods, Frank
