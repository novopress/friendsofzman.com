        Rufo is the latest in a long line of colorblind CivNats who decry identity politics for every group except Jews. According to him, Peterson, Sailer and others, everyone – except Jews – should be individuals, never acknowledging that we are literally a product of our ancestors and their culture and that we should fight to preserve both.Rufo and the others then attack anyone who points out their hypocrisy, even as they take money from Jewish interests. I dislike the Jewish elite but I understand them and what they’re trying to do for their people. I truly hate Rufo and his kind.

                What I hate is that they wrap their treachery in a moral cloak.
There is no group that defies and undermines colorblind civic nationalism more than Jews. Yet, none of these guys notices (even the self-described great noticer Steve Sailer), much less criticizes Jews.
Guys like Rufo and Sailer are either fuc$ing liars or fuc$ing stupid.

                    I am not following politics but I do scan headlines and YT videos and comments.  May just be limited to places I look, but I’m seeing a LOT of the standard  talking points being pushed by both left and right of late.  The usual “we’re all murkans” and it’s ‘stupid’ to divide people by race.  Lots of pious posing on both sides, but even the Lugenpresse seems to have been instructed to push the ‘unity’ message.  They are desperate to keep Whites from rediscovering that self-interest and tribal identity are innately tied to human history.

                        Yes. Oct. 7 made Jews realize that the Left’s identity politics, which they supported, wasn’t “good for the Jews.” As a result, they’re letting their Left minions know to tone that down.
The Right minions continue their idiotic colorblind civic nationalism.

                    It’s much easier to weave a tissue of morality than a cloak of facts. Deploy the shibboleths that activate the key emotional impulses and, viola, you’ve wrapped yourself in a chatoyant Civ-Nat flag with a lovely star-of-David-bedizened kippah that nets you a sack of sheckels and praise from the Leftist-Right. Pointing out unpalatable truths, on the other hand, puts one on a much stonier, obscure and threadbare path.

        A year ago, when elite universities were allowing students to protest Israeli genocide, Bill Ackman, a Jewish billionaire, claimed his eyes were awakened to the anti-White bigotry rampant on college campuses. Ackman needed a shabbos goy to give his campaign the air of legitimacy, and he chose Chris Rufo. Chris Rufo waved around Claudine Gay’s bloody scalp and idiot conservacucks cheered it on, claiming that yes Ackman may be a Jewish billionaire, but look right here, he said he cares about White people and we need allies! Well, look at this, Rufo is throwing one of his own people under the bus to satisfy his patrons, and he is not ashamed to say so explicitly. In fact, he might have been ordered to say so explicitly. Unfortunately, this is true of all conservatives, even ones that have done good work – like Chris Rufo. As for moral clarity, ironically it is the guy who Rufo is slagging who has it. He sacrificed a cozy, long career in conservacuck circles by talking about the one issue that he was ordered not to talk about. We are stumbling headfirst into a nuclear war and supporting a genocide because these people lack the courage to speak up.

        I think Rufo’s is a fair and honest letter: he’s putting his cards on the table that he just supports Jewish interests period and that’s a red line item for him.I think that’s a position that isn’t tenable — the way in which anti-semitism is manifesting now is due to over-the-top deleterious Jewish behavior (look at Mayorkas, Blinken, Nuland, etc.), and circling the wagons is only going to make it worse. Confronting bad Jewish behavior is necessary if one hopes to lower the rising temperature, but that would require some deep introspection and some very hard questions. The Jewish community never does this.That said, Rufo’s last line is correct imo – Brunet/Karlstack had a route to some decent money as a Shabbos goy social media figure, the bridge is burned, and he’s not going to make any money going the Fuentes route.

            I’m thinking a Trump win might be bad for the New Right / D-Right. If Trump pulls this off, all these e-influencers will be dancing like Israelis on 9/11 and thinking that everything is saved, much thanks to themselves of course. The “clever” ones will start pivoting to “maybe Kamala wasn’t so bad” like Spencer did and Hanania and Fuentes are primed for doing. Then Twitter stops being fun again as stupid takes sides.Meanwhile, the adults with money will still be sending theirs to Heritage and Glenn Beck and the purple-haired leftists will be planning a counter attack. Israel and their running dogs will carry on despite who wins, and judging by the amount of Semites in the New Right, this will retard things further.I’ll say this about the alt-right: at least they had the G*d damn good sense to retreat into their caves and do weird under-the-radar stuff, rather than whore for likes and follows. They had the actual system against them; they know what’s real and what isn’t.

                    Trump would definitely end up as the fall guy if shit gets sideways — economic collapse, war for Israel, etc.
He’d be vilified as a latter-day Herbert Hoover and it would be a one-party state for the next 80 years…

                        I suspect demographic change—now baked into the recipe—will produce a one party system for the next 80 years.  Little to nothing from the Rep’s can change this.  Trump is the last hurrah.

                            “Changing demographics” and the propaganda suited to them have produced a one party state already. Trump sends the system into outright madness by beingsomewhatuncontrolled opposition, the feeblest revenant of the defeated people. Before him it wasn’t a real possibility. The regime’s ghost-story villains, fascism and nazis and etc., of course never appeared except in fantasies and hoaxes. Then suddenly,actual vampire. (They can’t see that he’s not one. The “jump scare” is too intense.)

                            Properly put. While I didn’t think so initially, apparently the 2020 election actually was stolen and likely to prevent a chimp out. This time a calculation may have been made the chimp out is worth it, probably to benefit Israel. Either way, our votes will not decide the election.

                        “unless he’s promised the Power Structure a buffet of Levantine carnage”That could be a key factor, sadly. Academic Agent believes that the Ruling Class is divided into two factions: the “Techno-Globalists” and the Zionists. And he sees signs that the Zionists have had the upper hand recently. If he’s right, and if they currently favor Trump,andif they have the ability to affect the election, Trump might get in there.I’m hoping that Trump wins, at least to somewhat slow down the damage that we’re currently seeing at the border and elsewhere. To give a bit of a breathing space at least.

                            Whatever one’s views of Trump and his presidency overall, I think it’s difficult (and disingenuous) to argue – as many do – that his presidential pardons were not a talmudic disaster.  Lots of crooked Jews likeRubashkin and now Philip Esformes.  So yes, I agree some of the Zionists are backing him, and think another Trump term would be a disaster for White racial interests.  A Kamala win would be a catastrophe, but I think we are going in that direction regardless of electoral playacting.

                Trump, for us, is about maneuvering room.  Respectfully, regarding the phrasing below by MyS, it’s not about “…saving the system from itself ….”If the Left / Elites / Ruling Class (whatever) gains full possession again of the formal seats of power, they will likely move quickly to ensure their position can never be challenged again.I believe that, if they do order into action the Big Cheat, they will simply accept any pushback as a cost of doing business.  Who’s going to administer any real repercussion?  The Republican Party? The courts? Congress?  Academia? …. Media?  None will, and if they did, it would not matter — using previously acceptable methodsThey’ve taken decades to build their machine and complete the initial movements of their assets.  They are there, now.  All they need to do to disrupt any possible public pushback is to take their actions “under color of authority.”Yes, it’s not Trump who will lead us into the Promised Land.  But that’s not his mission.  His task is to lead us to the river.  Like Moses, he is not the Messiah.  He will not be the one to take us across to whatever lies beyond.  Success for him, is just to get enough of us there, and to squeeze out of our people a small cadre of true warrior leaders.  from our perspective here, we will hope (OK … as they say, “hope” is not a plan), that both the people, and a capable, charismatic leader will take over — a leader, I would condition, who has the courage and endurance clearly demonstrated by that one, admittedly fallible and often frustrating, yet still remarkable man.

                    You’ve described it as I see it also.  If the Ruling Class wins this year, they will keep the borders open with impunity, encouraging as many future Dems to migrate in as possible, along with doing all kinds of other things to consolidate their power.  I liked very much how you described Trump as the man leading us to the river.  I still think he can fill that role.

        I’m not a “conspiracy theorist” but let’s not forget that Buckley was CIA, like current “conservative” radio host Buck Sexton.
The CIA of course ran Operation Mockingbird. You can’t discount the possibility that “conservatism” has been controlled opposition for sixty years… hence the “purges.”

            Maybe but I subscribe to Z’s greed motivation. If you look at the very early National Review, assuming it hasn’t been scrubbed, and you find a lot of what would now be called “anti-Semitism” and “racism.” Buckley was a staunch defender then of the right of association and was staunchly opposed to “civil rights.”
Buckley threw Buchanan under the bus the nanosecond the price got right. Drag $10,000 bills down a Greenwich thoroughfare…

            America has been a cryptocracy for sixty years, at least.  The intel agencies have far more power than the Demoncraps or Repugnicants, per se.  The old families and old money were invested in the Ivy League societies and sub-groups.  The Identity Totalitarians slowly are taking over, even as the rank-and-file of, say, the CIA morphs from patriotic white men to women/feminists and the of-color brigades.

        They aren’t conserving anything. They are clinging to an ideal that is used to destroy its manifestation. They aren’t conservatives. Nor are they on the right. They are leftists.The right and left are terms that have a specific meaning that comes from the French Revolution. The Left were the supporters of the egalitarian order and/or opposed to the dissolution of the Ancien Regime. The Right were the supporters of Tradition and its Order.Does Rufo support Tradition in the classical sense with a time horizon of thousands of years? No. He has one toe in the 90s and the rest of his being fulling moving, (progressing), into the future.The best thing our movement can do is stop calling itself Dissident. We are not Dissidents. We are Traditionalists and thus we are The Right. I think we should even leave behind the left/right framing. We are simply Traditionalists who seek to establish and preserve and cultivate the Highest Functioning Order – that is Western Civilization for Western Man. We must frame this in order to frame the friend/enemy distinction.Calling Rufo a rightist or a conservative is conceding that his ilk can continue to call themselves a “new right” when they are really the 80’s left. When we commit to this framing we muddy the waters. It is time to stop. We must assert that our way is the way of optimal spiritual and physical health from the top to the bottom of all official and emergent hierarchies in Our Order.It is time that Rufo/Rubin/Peterson/Williamson/Brand … … be exposed as just a different flavor of anti-Traditionalist aka Leftist.

            Rufo can’t (seriously) answer the fundamental question: Who are your people? (He’d say Americans, which is why he’s a child or a liar.)
His Jewish patrons can answer that question.

                A while back Rufo was asked by a black interviewer what was so great about being white. What should have been a slam dunk for Rufo flustered him instead. White people created Western Civilization, philosophy, modern science, classical music, classical art and architecture, etc., all of which have been extensively imitated by non-white people in the sincerest form of flattery.  QED.

                    That answers the question of what makes the white race great. However, that’s not the same thing as how great it is to be white. Right now, with our lands being overrun by dusky savages and our civilization being subverted by race traitors and Jews, it is decidedlynotgreat to be white.

            Outstanding comment. We are traditionalists to the bone. We think the West should be overwhelmingly white to name one important issue. France should be overwhelmingly ethically French and so on and so forth. Men and women should not compete with each other, excessive aberrations especially in the sexual domain have probably been forcefully been marginalized for very good reasons in the past. And generally we don’t think our ancestors in olden days were idiots or savages so their customs probably made sense even if we don’t always see why immediately. And important things should not be changed without compelling reason, profound consideration and humble prudence

        Brunet has had a tendency of attacking people to gain clout for himself. In the past he has  went after Martin and Auron MacIntyre (who made a comment that boiled down to “Brunet is an emotional retard and Rufo’s tut-tutting over Israel is ridiculous”). Also, a Hanania endorsement is a kiss of death.Simply put, we can’t take these e-celebs seriously as any leader of a movement. The best ones understand this and stay in their lane. While some are good at persuasion and optics for our message, and watching the monkeys throw poo can be fun, nothing is going to be fixed through these dumb beefs.Lucky for us, Rufo is the best Con-Inc has for gatekeeping, and he can’t do squat.

Faux News is full of men and women like this.
Would you rather be right or would you rather be rich?
Until you’re in that situation, you don’t really know the answer.  So it is with all temptation.

        The left-right debate is about who hates the past the most.That’s truly profound and it had the side effect of making me laugh.I won’t diminish the prominent role of raw greed, but moral and ethical cowardice along with a pronounced form of Stockholm Syndrome animate quite a bit of the goy grovel. In addition to digging the shekels stuffed into his pocket, Buckley loved the admiration of those who put it there and winced at their criticism. As you point out, he was a larger-than-life figure while Rufo is basically a sad footnote on the internet; Buckley also was inherently evil rather than a mere prison snitch.Among the reasons you will not find the essay version of IN SEARCH OF ANTI-SEMITISM online is much of what it criticized has been confirmed. Although it still cannot be emphasized very much, Buchanan’s (Irving’s, to be accurate for the most part) historical recounting of the war has been quietly confirmed to various degrees in academic circles.As the new politics puts this pathos in the rear-view mirror and Buckley’s old rag produces the latest CONSERVATIVE CASE FOR (fill in the latest unhinged progressive movement), the World War II mythos slowly dies but its proponents fight desperately to fan the embers. Just as those who do so are losers, the cause itself is losing and soon will have no relevance. Rufo-type fifth columnists abound in this now-occupied communist hellhole and it pays to choose friends wisely, but glasnost is on the horizon. Embrace the panic.

            Rufo is the one-trick-pony who puts together plagiarism charges against the “intellectual left”.  He’s erroneously credited with taking down the former diversity-hire president of Harvard (so that the people who actually got her canned could continue to hide behind a curtain).

                Nailed it. Rufo provided the cover and became the target so that those with the gold could threaten Harvard in the shadows. Take note that Gay was a beloved anti-white racist beloved by the same donors right up until she refused to take a truncheon to students who said unapproved things about Our Greatest Ally. A Tribeswoman was inserted into Gay’s slot, and it is likely the anti-white shenanigans are gearing back up. There is no way Gay’s ineptitude as a DEI hire, if not her plagiarism was unknown until October 7th.

                    Based on what we have seen over the years, plagiarism is rampant in these minority academic circles and likely approaches 100%. Of course, nobody really cares about plagiarism, when these people submit their work it can be checked for plagiarism like it is for high schoolers, everyone knows it is going on. Yet… this is useful for the elites as they have this person on a very short leash and can yank it at any time, similar to the petty corruption from all these minority politicians (like Eric Adams, putting his mayorship in jeopardy over some first class flights to Turkey LOL).And it was a Tribesman named Alan Garber who replaced Gay, as for the DEI, if I recall correctly he was part of Harvard’s DEI committee, so yes, obviously, the firing had nothing to do with anti-White animus or anything like that.

                        Exactly. Seems most or all these faux pas’s we seem to hear of, like for the current Dem VP choice, are easily discoverable in the age of the Internet. Therefore, the logical conclusion is that they *were* discovered and pocketed for future use. Purpose is to control/blackmail the individual who obtains power when necessary.
It’s as old as J Edgar Hoover when he remained in office waay past mandatory retirement through repeated Congressional extensions/waivers.

                If I am correct, she didn’t get canned in the sense that we would understand it. She stepped down from her post as President, but she is still employed in her other role(s) and collecting her $900,000 annual salary.She was never punished for the intense anti-White, anti-Occidental, anti-American iconoclasm she engaged in during her reign as President. Nor was any of the institutionalized anti-White curriculum and moral foundation repudiated and made illegal when Ackerman and his buddies came in.This connects with an earlier comment about how it would be wise to lower the temperature on the part of a certain group. The Regime’s entire basis is that it is anti-White. Every day this is proven by what they will denounce, what they will pretend-punish, (like Gay retaining her $900K sinecure(s) after being, “fired”), and what pogroms will not be arrested. So the burner remains on high and the curtains are dangerously close to the flame.We haven’t been reckoned with yet. A lot of organizing remains to be done, but with backs against the wall you can sense that a storm is gathering. Do not fear it. Be it.

                    Another good example of how these people are never held accountable. The institutions currently still have a lot of money to throw at those like Gay whose incompetencies and evils are revealed, and are forced out of one position or another, only to land on their feet somewhere else. I wonder how long it will take for that money to dry up, and what will happen then.
And it’s not just in the USA of course. One of the most stomach-churning examples for me is the former New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern.

                            My Christian faith tells me that they will be held accountable ultimately, in a way that’s not to their liking.  But that sure doesn’t stop me from wanting to see justice done in this world!  And you know what?–with the way so many of those people are so far out of touch with reality, I sense sometimes that they will come crashing down from their big heights for all of us to see.  Maybe not, but this web of lies which they live on can’t last forever.Tucker Carlson recently interviewed a journalist Mark Halperin who thinks, from his own direct experience with them, that the Neocons actually believe their own nonsense.  In a way, that’s a lot more dangerous than people who prop up the Military Industrial Complex for their own material gain.  But it also means that, like the Communists, they’re living in a dream world which can’t last.  I just hope we see the downfall of all of this.

                    “…like Gay retaining her $900K sinecure(s) after being, “fired”)”.Every academic (as opposed to non-academic, non-PhD) taking a high level academic administrative position accepts a tenured appointment within an academic department as well as the administrative position.This is a de facto “golden parachute”.  Most often, when the academic serves his “time” in the administrative position, he resigns and takes up residence at his tenured department—without pay cut!  In my former university, this happened all the time, especially at department head level, with college Deans, University Presidents, and the like.It was somewhat of a scandal when the newspapers and then the legislature finally caught wise.  I believe a *new* policy was then established that one reverted to the more commonly accepted wage scale when one took on less responsibilities.  However, I was never at a level where I examined “the books”, so who knows?Harvard, with more money than god, probably has a similar process firmly imbedded within its system.  As far as I know, Gay was not fired—as in dismissed for cause—but officially resigned.  So she was able to remain as a tenured professor in her department. There is also the aspect of her race (which is why she got to be President), so docking her pay would simply raise the ire of Blacks.  $900k is a cheap price to pay for silence on her part and to put the scandle to bed.

                        “There is also the aspect of her race (which is why she got to be President), so docking her pay would simply raise the ire of Blacks. $900k is a cheap price to pay for silence on her part and to put the scandle to bed.”Bingo! This is a racial patronage network with traitorous Whites in a very strange position in the sordid coalition.This was more theatre. I still think this angered blacks who want to not just be at the head, but run the entire show.The interesting part of the coalition culling came in the primaries of Cori Bush and Jamaal Bowman. They got primar-ied by the one group that cannot be criticized. Not sure what the consolation prize is/was for them if there was one at all. They will pop up as commentators or administrators somewhere in the patronage network.In the short run this is all fine and dandy. However, feathers will be ruffled and once you are forced to show your hand and your only means to keeping your coalition together is bribery and threats you are already on the road to making enemies who are biding their time for when you start to run out of money or the costs exceed the benefits.As this phase has been entered, you can bet the overt White dispossession will be the table that is feasted at. This will only create more enemies.I am waiting for some intelligent White people to come to the Reparations Debate/Party armed with the records of who financed, provided logistic support and across the Ottoman world and North and South America enabled the trade.Name the names and show the profits and trace them back to their descendants today. If that happens, and it needs to happen, then we will see the coalition have some interesting, “discussions.”

                            So as a practical matter, I’d say it would be the local trade associations, co-ops, civic and private clubs to hobnob with, in building up a Grange coalition of interests.
Them’s the customer list to cold call.They have things they want to get, and have things they can offer. As well, it would offer parallel economy opportunities for /our people/.  These are mature, established orgs operating under the radar.

            Left and right are slowly being ignored into extinction. “Where have they gone? I must hurry after them, for I am their leader..”. and to think it was the illegal immigrants who opened our eyes. They drive with no license, no insurance, if arrested, prison is a vacation for them. They do what they want and the authorities cannot interfere. Once you realize you can do without most things the government provides, it’s very freeing.

        An example if I may. Dan Bongino loves Jesus. Just ask him. He will tell you that . . . often . . . and with visceral verve and an impassioned exclamation. And then in the next sentence, he will praise Israel for exterminating the vermin Amalek demons known as Palestinian women and children. It matters not that IDF snipers shoot children in the forehead as sport or burn patients alive in Palestinian hospitals or kill off entire civilian neighborhoods in Beirut. Dan is as morally pure as the wind-driven snow in January. Praise Jesus, Dan the Man.

            It’s been my experience that every single Christian who loudly tells you how much he loves Jesus is just doing it as a mask because he’s a pedophile, malignant narcissist, psychopath, or just a regular old asshole.
Wasn’t there something Jesus said about people who pray loudly in the streets instead of silently at home?

        These internet personalities and their silly feuds are entertaining to some, but it’s just feminized slap-fight ridiculousness to me. If they generally have a gripe, they should go to the Thunderdome, “two men enter, one man leaves” and settle it like gentlemen.
But they won’t. It’s all about the fake world online where people talk smack in a way that lets you know they’ve never been hit in the mouth and would cry like little female dogs if they were struck.

        Ironically, the stuff Rufo fulminates against (DEI/transgenderism) are basically Jewish ideological creations. Pointing this out will get you exiled to the fever swamps of the internet and Rufo knows this. I suspect he is trying to create some cover to deflect the Jewish hostility his work would normally create. I am skeptical that this strategy will work. Normally, opposition to Jewish ideological efforts (e.g, DEI, transgenderism, Zionism) automatically makes you an anti-Semite and saying nice things about Jews will not absolve you.

            Agree 100%.  At the moment, Rufo seems to be comfortably part of the Manhattan Institute/City Journal, which features such wondrous intellects as Claire Berlinski. God knows what else he has done to ingratiate himself with them.  He will minutely have to watch his vocabulary from now on.

                    Yes, MacDonald has done some good work.  One reason I highlighted Berlinski is because she seems to have clearly risen because of nepotism, and she has offered some howlingly awful conclusions over the years.  And she’s not the only one there like that.

                        Haven’t read City Journal for I guess a decade now. Has Berlinski bugged out from Istanbul where she was under highly effective deep  cover pretending to be some kind of flaneureuse cum deep thoughts scribbler for the obvious Israeli no such people? Hopefully she tripped over a rune in Haggia Sophia and skedaddled screaming back to Brooklyn.Ah no… A peek at Wikipedia puts her in Paris. Well, it *is* Cosmopolitan.Actually given that she left Turkey just after an attempted Turkish Spring and has also along with her brother done a stint living in Thailand (*) there’s a strong likelihood that there’s more to her backstory than meets the eye.*Thailand, Laos, Cambodia attract huge amounts of Israeli tourists flush with cash and in need of a vacation after finishing their initial mandatory conscription term. Big Israeli clandestine involvement especially in Thailand ostensibly to help protect the local tourism industry from Arab terrorism, but they’re up to all kinds of other things too, of course.

                            HA! You seem to have a good grasp of La Berlinski. I vividly remember her making grand, penetrating conclusions some years ago about Turkey, based on what all of her Turkish associates were telling her, who, she let slip, were all pseudo-intellectuals (my term) that she met with in the Istanbul or Ankara cafes. Supposedly they had deep insight into what was going on all around the country, but she, and they, were obviously off base, and out of touch with people outside the big cities.There was also her rant about how the German rock group Rammstein was the next incarnation of the Nazis (the same Rammstein who have sometimes put themselves out on left-wing limbs, and played up to LGBTQ multiple times. Not to mention their use of giant phalluses in concert, etc.). I guess the image of 6 bare-chested white German guys on an album cover was enough to give her Semitic self the vapors. And led her to fantasize about panzers plowing through the Polish countryside, etc.Interesting about Thailand! I didn’t know that. I’m sure that sex tourism is not on their agenda. :-/

        I think these beefs are a pretty standard aspect of the emergence of a new movement. On the Israel thing, I think Rufo is pro-Israel, Brunet is anti-Israel and McIntyre is steadfastly “not my fight” regarding Israel. The future belongs to the young people. Eventually, when the largely pro-Israel Boomercons fade away, the Millennials will speak. Not surprisingly, a lot of smart Jewish money is backing Rufo. He’s a businessman. So it fits. But I’m guessing the long-run center of gravity for Millennial “conservatism” will be McIntyre’s view. Our foreign policy is an expensive failure. “Morality” aside, we cannot afford this crap anymore.

            The movement will evolvetotally naturallyinto what about it suits the regime: neoreactionary obedience to tech/intelligence executives, upper middle class replacement by “high IQ” immigrants—a retvrn to meritocracy after the madness of DEI!—and as a sop to the white religious a repeat of the left-feminist “Christian right” boomer censorship campaigns of the ’80s-’00s (which will just happen to banfascismandhateas well as free teen boobs and two rap videos).

        Rufo: It does not require a complex calculus to conclude that, in terms of both national interest and basic moral reasoning, America should support Israel over Hamas.The entire purpose of statements like this is to short-circuit the process of doing a complex calculus regarding the issue, to shut down debate.I’m with George Washington, who, in his letter to the Hebrew congregation in Newport, Rhode Island, established America’s friendship with the Jews, in beautiful terms: “May the Children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other Inhabitants;while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and figtree, and there shall be none to make him afraid*.May the father of all mercies scatter light and not darkness in our paths, and make us all in our several vocations useful here, and in his own due time and way everlastingly happy.”George Washington also said:“The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is in extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little political connection as possible. So far as we have already formed engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us stop. Europe has a set of primary interests which to us have none; or a very remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics, or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities.”“Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a different course….“Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor or caprice?“It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world; so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it; for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing engagements. I hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs, that honesty is always the best policy. I repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed in their genuine sense. But, in my opinion, it is unnecessary and would be unwise to extend them.”*American Jews long ago ceased to “sit under their own vine or figtree.” Instead they have worked to impose Jewish power and morality upon the nation in which they reside, but under the guise of secularism.

            moral reasoningHis tweet has the word “good” in it something like ten times, so he’s moral. And good and rational are synonyms. Q.E.D., racists. Join antifa!A conservative who favors Israel for whatever reason has available to him a variety of arguments from history, religion, race, etc., even libertarian-economic “imperial realism” if you’re feelingsuper American—expansivelyreductio. Real Anglo-conservatives know all this and ignore it. Their claim is that the Isrealis are, to a decisive degree, “us,” creedal brothers in Western Civilization. Of course they aren’t. Ask them. But it’s a conservative claim—not of goodness but of sameness, of siding withyourself—that an old Derb kinda guy might actually believe.(Viewed as dimly as conservatives should be disposed to view them, the quasi-polity called Palestine is uncivilizable because it’s made of Arab idiots and the nation called Israel is cynicallyanti-civilizational because it’s made of Jewish psychos, so we should root for maximum casualties. But conservatives don’t talk like that anymore. Too old-fashioned.)Rufo doesn’t have a conservative sensibility, any sense brotherhood with other guys, not even with Israel. He has the shitlib inverse of it: “You’re not aweird loser, are you, siding withthem? I bet you wore a Rorschach mask during covid. Doormen don’t let you in many parties, do they?” It’s girly.

        ‘They start by agreeing with the central premise of progressivism, which is that all people are equal and infinitely malleable. Hierarchy is therefore a construct.’The truth is that nowhere on Earth, or in heaven, is anybody equal. Nobody is ‘equal’ to anybody else.  Equality is the foul great-grandson of the Jacobins, which they termed egalite.  It is the fundamental Lie.Hierarchy is the way of all Creation, but the inferior hate hierarchy, because naturally they come in last in the face of it.  So both the Left and the Right cling to the lie of egalitarianism, because both the Left and the Right are led by the inferior.  The state of the nation is evidence thereof.

        I’m not an avid follower of Rufo (although he seems like a decent guy who’s doing worthwhile work), and I’ve never even heard of the other guy. So this column is the first I’ve heard of their “controversy.”I’ve noticed, however, that whenever the anti-Israel charge arises, conservatives trot out Washington’s Letter to the Hebrew Congregation like it’s a slam-dunk endorsement of  unequivocal American support.But the letter is much more temporizing than they pretend. Here’s the concluding paragraph (which Chris Rufo quotes in the tweet to which Zman linked) with some usually ignored clauses emphasized:“May the Children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, CONTINUE TO MERIT and enjoy the good will of the other Inhabitants; while every one shall sit in safety UNDER HIS OWN VINE AND FIGTREE, and there shall be none to make him afraid. May the father of all mercies scatter light and not darkness in our paths, and make us all IN OUR SEVERAL VOCATIONS USEFUL HERE, and in his own due time and way everlastingly happy.”This is arguably the opposite of a “minoritarian” perspective. It envisions a society where a minority identity remains separate and distinct from the majority, serves a useful purpose within that majority, and has to merit the majority’s good will.Earlier this week, Zman ran a headline reading, “Washington Was Right”—and maybe this is one of the matters he was referring to.

As terrible as GAE management has been for the past twenty-plus years, the USD is still the cleanest dirty shirt in the hamper by quite a margin.
The extremely difficult problem for the individual is positioning themselves in advance for the day the USD is no longer the cleanest dirty shirt.

            I’m skeptical of BRICS. First of all, it’s a creation of American bankers, who started classifying these countries in this way to identify “emerging” markets in the 2000s. There’s not really that much right now that ties most of them together at the moment, although certainly American incompetence and belligerence has done much to tie Russia and China together. Secondly, as of now, most of these countries are basket cases. South Africa is in total collapse. India is… India. Brazil is turning into some weird judicial oligarchy and is still very much under the thumb of the Monroe Doctrine and CIA as we learned during the last election. While there is no doubt that Washington DC/London/Paris are sweating Russia/China, BRICS as an entity? Nah.

            Arguing that BRICS is the future is about as valid as claiming the West has a future. Both ignore demographics. Brazil is a largely Africanized/Indigenized nation with a European minority most evident in the south of the country. Russia following the Soviet break-up has a declining Slavic supermajority somewhat analogous to America of the 1980s, and seems equally oblivious to its being in any way significant. India is a jumble of ethnicities whose inherent contradictions were once mediated by a strict caste system, but which since independence has undertaken to uplift its lower castes by affirmative action. China is an overwhelmingly Han society that has regained the global status it enjoyed up until 1640, and explicitly defines itself as such. South Africa is a failed state after the end of Apartheid rule, whose less than 10 percent population of whitesis being slowly strangled by quotas on hiring and business ownership when not actively killed or driven into exile by black hooligans, yet still accounts for 90 percent of taxes. The well-informed readers of this site can draw their own conclusions.

                BRICS at the bottom of it is simply resource extraction, an export market for PRC manufactures, and a currency in which to transact both of these without Shlomo taking his customary cut.The PRC (and to a lesser extent, I suspect, but non-zero extent nonetheless) Russian ruling elites are smart enough to say one thing for public consumption whilst doing another for realpolitik considerations. The only danger would be that they come to believe their own BS in time and open their borders to the Brown Hordes. I don’t see that happening anytime soon. Meanwhile they can use the public-facing story of BRICS to belabour the West for its various hypocrisies. From their perspective, what’s not to like? Come one come all Fuzzy Wuzzies and Heathens Without the Law and join in our new trading bloc and stick one to the Gringos.It’s fair deal for the Fuzzy Wuzzies and Heathens because they get to sell their rocks and crops and oil and gas for a fair-ish price and get back perfectly serviceable Huawei phones which don’t spy on them any more than do Google phones or iPhones. They also don’t get compulsory anal sex and troon propaganda.

        Buckley knew there were loads of cash waiting for him if he denounced the paleoconsAs did the Most Reverend Dick Neuhaus at First Things, who had fought with Tom Fleming at Chronicles a few years before and gotten into arguments over keys to buildings, etc., etc. He didn’t have to worry about that after his spat with Fleming. Cash Money Productions cut him a check.These clowns spent incredible amounts of energy helping Bill Clinton and the New Left into office in the US. Those of us from that era, I hope you spit at the mention of these names as I do. And then they had the gall to run the idiotic Clinton impeachment hearings in the House in 1998, which cost them the majority and had no chance — none — of succeeding in the Senate. NATO bombing Serbia? Not a peep. Turning Iraq into a satrapy? Not a problem, either. These were not serious men.It’s been like that ever since with the GOP, save for Bush and Cheney going on a murder spree for a few years.

        A friend gave me a book to read, How the Scots Invented the Modern World, by Arthur Herman. Fascinating stuff. Earlier, less famous figures of the Scottish Enlightenment presaging the woke, the soft, the polite, the locust, even Marxism, according to the author.
My friend asked me, “Did we do this?” Yeah, I think we did— by mistake, by assuming our ideas are universal. I think it’s the Anglosphere take on civilization, still being worked out.
Anyway, good book. Don’t know if it’s well-known, and I’m only about 100 pages into it, but I recommend it.

        I opened this essay genuinely hoping to read about how regimes in the past systematically exiled or killed their enemies in the government and broader society after rising to power.
This was good, too.  So consider this a reader suggestion.

                Hard to believe they won’t try to stop Trump from taking office.  But, if he somehow prevails, a purge is going to be needed.
Democrats are big on the reeducation camps and gulags.  I’d like thought on how our side could do this since our value system is different.

        I’d never heard of the other guy, Rufo I have heard of, he is useful in collecting some scalps.No, Rufo is not a savior. But we need to be realistic about our situation and our goals as non-Elite Whites. Our nation is gone. America is never coming back. There will be no ethno-state as mass third world immigration has irrevocably changed places like Springfield OH and Charleroi PA to a third world hellhole. And chain migration will only make it worse. There is enormous money to be made by subsidized third world labor on your tax dollar, so it will never ever stop.White people’s situation is that of someone whose house got destroyed and Insurance will not cover it for political/social reasons. So we are all living in our car. Our goal is not to get the house back — that will never happen. The goal is to move into a nice RV instead of a barely moving car.As such, survival is the name of the game. We can’t be picky, or let old grudges define us. Even when they are legitimate. Saturday people are divided just like us, they have their own version of cool Wine aunts, and those threatened like Ackman. He understood it would be only a matter of time, from chasing Saturday people out of the Ivies to seizing his stuff. So he is a convenient ally in that we will be first before him. Having him apply brakes is good.I live in SoCal. I have seen this first-hand, tipping to non-White majority and explicit anti-White stuff as a result. So that is my perspective.

            Reasonable take, but I suggest there is one huge fly in the ointment. California has had the rest of the United States act as a brake on its worst impulses. When the United States falls officially (vs. the unofficial version now), whether this time, 2028, 2032, whenever, there will be no brake to safeguard the van down by the river. It seems likely there will bede factoseparations or whatever at that point as survival mechanisms. If you listen closely to Musk and to a lesser degree Ackman, they acknowledge as much. They at least pretend it can be stopped, but reading between the lines, they are wanting to slow it down, albeit for wildly different reasons from most and even from each other. Some of the people I know in SoCal (this is not you, I realize) really don’t appreciate how close the same tipping point is in the rest of the United States.

        So a new politics is coming. Perhaps. But it’s difficult to imagine what that may be outside of the centuries-old Left/Right dyad. If anybody has a clue, I’d be interested in hearing it.

        The Soviet purges were actual, hardcore, no-bullshit purges. Then, they killed you outright or dragged you off to the gulags. Americans have a ways to go to match that feat. Let’s imagine, for a moment, a future liberal purge of conservatives … ***The sun sets over the mountains. FEMA Camp 15 is open for business. A train pulls up at the station, disgorging prisoners. These are the white-collar political prisoners of the second Kamala Harris term of office. Cameras are recording this for posterity.A 40ish man, who looks like a banker, has a giant letter “J” pinned to his back. It stands for Juvenile, meaning he is being childishly emotional about one of Harris’ government programs. In this case, Banker Man protested share your vehicle with a trans person legislation.Whips crack in the air. The banker is driven to his knees, his shirt rent by half a dozen slash marks.
