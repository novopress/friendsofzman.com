        It’s tough to get over the Democrats going on about how he helped to start a gay club for students at the school he taught and coached at. Now, maybe it’s another exaggeration, maybe he didn’t actually start it. Assuming he did, though, I guarantee that the parents of the school did not see it as the stunning and brave move that the DNC claimed it was. It’s a very strange thing. The serial lies and exaggerations also point to him trying very hard to cover up the reality of his life and situation. Also somebody doesn’t go from teaching in some Minnesota backwater to the potential VP of the USA by accident. It doesn’t work that way. Somebody and something has been pushing him along. I wouldn’t be surprised if there are some very disturbing skeletons in his closet, skeletons that of course the intelligence agencies and foreign lobbies know all about and use it against him. This is, ultimately, how the system it works. The reason why so many of our leaders are weird perverts and broken people is because they are the ones that can be easily controlled and manipulated. Nobody can look at someone like Lindsey Graham and say, here is an honest and upfront man speaking from his heart. He’s probably the most obvious example but on some level, they’re all like this.

            Even today, yet even moreso in the 1990s when it happened, is there any man who is not a pedophile who decides to run a gay club for the high school kids? Normal heterosexual men do not do that. Ever. Even homo men would be reluctant to do that, because they fear the blowback. Perhaps some pink haired shitlib woman would do it, because she thinks it’s stunning and brave, and today’s culture has convinced her it’s virtuous (although the culture wasn’t really there yet in the 1990s). But only one kind of “man” does that, then or now. Tim Walz is a pedophile. 100%.

                “is there any man who is not a pedophile who decides to run a gay club for the high school kids? Normal heterosexual men do not do that.”
I could see a non-pedo charismatic ultra-liberal man doing it to show what a fearless pioneer he is.  He’d have to have the big personality to get the idea over without being embarrassed about it.

                    Maybe today, arguably. Perhaps. Here in clown world where such is more normalized. There might be 1 in 10,000 hetero men who would. But a quarter century ago? Not buying it. Pedo, 100%.
It is only because we are here in clown world, when it is more normalized, that more people are not seeing this for what it is.

                        I tend to agree. It’s just not something a normal person would ever think of doing, ever. I don’t even think they would do it now, let alone 25 years ago.  The gay school club thing is by far the weirdest and most peculiar thing on his resume, yet of course it is the one thing the GOP refuses to discuss, because, according to the pornstar with face tattoos that they brought on stage during their convention, the GOP is totally great for gay people. I can’t wait for the article on National Review arguing “the conservative case for men starting gay clubs in the schools they work in.”

                Oh yeah.  Tampon Tim was recruiting when he put tampons in the boy’s room.
What are the two big names of those queer pedo organizations in schools, GLSEN and another one, that got traction under the Clintons?  And that white-haired lesbian lunatic or two who was girlboss of the Education Dept.?

            Herein is the strange tale of Communism in the USA.The secret to the Kamala, Walz, Hillary, and Obama camps is that they are Maoists, not Marxists.The Soviet Marxists infiltrators focused on class.The Chinese Maoist infiltrators focused on race.Communism’s role and success is because it provides an alternative framework for a competing elite.Religions begin as alternative political movements.Thus, ‘ideology’ is a nascent religion- that is, an alternative moral axis based on an anchor and a narrative- that eventually leads to an alternative culture, drawing alternative breeding (marriage) schemes and creating its own economies (ladders of opportunity).The Soviet leftbehinds’ were marooned in the West when the USSR fell apart. Like our own Cold War mummies, their careerist’s areas of expertise are all they know, so they continued doing what they did, organizing colonial cells in academia, student unions, and union halls. Eventually their unions funded the traditional framework of the Democrat ward heeler, a robust frame of local domestic organizing, networking, and patronage.The Chinese, being Plan B of the globalists, picked up the slack after the Fall.The Maoists were of the Angela Davis types, who used nonwhite race, rather than corporatism, as their anchor. Their influence formed under Vietnam, just as the Soviet Marxist cells formed under WWII.Hillary’s technician, Obama, like Kamala and Walz, had been groomed since childhood as a red diaper baby.As American corporations offshored, the Chinese alternative funding roundabout grew colonial cells in such places as Nepal or Arkansas, with its 1000 Chinese front companies under the Clinton governorship.The Chicago DSA (Democrat Socialist Alliance) took the Pelosi/Reid Congress under President Obama, fronting for West Coast Silicon Valley and Chinese Red Chips under the secretive billionaire Democracy Alliance.As a result, neoliberal money shifted away from the dying Rust Belt Marxist (economic) union neocommunism towards a Maoist (racial, identity group) orientation.They went Woke when the USSR well dried up and the Chinese fountain opened.A competing technocratic oligarchy has formed. The Thiel/Musk Palantir mafia has thrown in its lot with Trump. It is attracting elites such as Dimon, Ackerman, and Madeleine Adelson. Note that this competing elite has a different cultural flavor. Let us hope it can contend with the Intelligence statists, the PostMarxist (postmodernist) credential bottleneck of academia, and the corrupt hypocrite PostMaoist politicals.

                p.s.- Racial politics is what made Mao a modern Emperor Qing, the great tyrant who united China by ending the wars between China’s many ethnic kingdoms.Mao was a nobody on the Long March during the Warlord period brought on by the kosher coin of Judaic opium capitalism and Bolshevik Soviet communism.Mao brokered a deal with a local warlord whose army was four times the size of the beleaguered Long March forces, preventing the Communists’ extinction and bringing him to prominence within the nascent Party.His grandchildren, the Red Princes, now rule from behind the scenes as a shadow dynasty.  The many ethnicities of China are united as a thousand flowers blooming under the firm hand of his monarchy.

                    It’s fascinating to note the difference between CCP racial and ethnic agitprop and American.  The Chinese love to produce media that demonstrates the thoroughness with which (insert minority people) have accepted amd benefited from the Sinicization of their homelands.  Meanwhile, we engage in equal parts self-flagellation and admiration for the clearly superior culture of our victims.

        We’ve simply reached the stage where the politicians are openly actors. People could (sort of) pretend that Bush II was in charge. People even somehow believed that Obama was in charge. But few believed that Biden was in charge and no one will believe that Harris or Fudd is in charge.The shadowy and foreign oligarchy that has run the show for (at least) 25 years has tired of pretending that it’s not in charge. You can see it in Biden’s cabinet. Unfortunately, it really is an oligarchy so, while it’s in charge, there’s no head of the oligarchy, so its rule is confused and disjointed – outside of support for Israel.

            We’re reached the stage where the cabinet are largely actors also. Every layer of accountability is turning into a figurehead role. This isn’t just government either. The CEO of my company is clearly an actor, and does what she is told. Basically any figure who goes out in public you need to assume is an actor for someone running things in the shadows.

                Yes. Biden’s cabinet are also actors. But there’s a reason that they’re almost all Jewish. The tribe is tired of pretending. I don’t blame them. It has to be annoying to pretend that you’re not in charge and that some rube goy is running the show. At the very least, the actors should be your people.

                I’ve related the tale before of how my former part-time state rep was clearly a sock puppet hired by someone else to do the job.  As well, just recently a local oligarch (using the term *very* loosely) expressed an interest in a town-council job, which I thought was big of him, until I realized that he was probably asking on behalf of whatever clown he was going to have run for the position.The long and short is, I would be shocked if even half the people who represent you at the very local level came by the idea to run for office on their own.

                    I was routinely approached to run as a national candidate in my 30’s-40’s. Somebody hadn’t done their homework because I had been a Hillsdale republican since birth and used to do.the.hay rides and pumpkin carvings on Dave Stockman’s parents’ farm. Despite my years pursuing an education U.Mich at Ann Arbor, I have never experienced a desire to be leftist or queerbot. I attribute some of this to my dad compelling me to.martial sports beginning in the second.grade. But it was always the small hats, especially “mentors,” who were feeding me bullshit that I would be “dynamite” in politics. In fact, I suck at politics and hate the field utterly.

            Yes, that consensus is spreading well outside of our sphere, too. Lefties have expressed complete satisfaction with real power resting in a machine they can’t really define. People will put up with the oligarchy/autocracy being fully in charge as long as they are fed and housed. It is hard to wrap your mind around the sort who would degrade and debase themselves and pretend they have power bestowed by the constitution, blah, blah, blah, but there are no shortage of people ready, able and willing to get a role in the big show. As you may recall, footage emerged of AOC successfully reading lines to snag her role as progressive congressactor.  No one even bothered to challenge the authenticity of the vid. As you note, this always has been the case but the wrinkle is hostile aliens comprising the ruling cabal. It is potentially deadly to be in their employ or among their preferred constituents, but another feature of the present is rank stupidity so the ensemble largely doesn’t have a clue the series might be cancelled kinetically at some point.

                People will put up with the oligarchy/autocracy being fully in charge as long as they are fed and housed.﻿Not so.Did the regime emergeweakenedfrom the times of our people’s greatest misery? For example, from approximately the beginning of WWI to the end of WWII, Americans were unprecedentedly misgoverned, impoverished, andkilled—by their rulers, openly acting against the expressed popular will. Result? “The post-war consensus,” i.e., all that we see—and a very near future technological hell in which we are never again allowed to see.People will embrace any system thathurts other people. Their own oppression, pain, and even death are irrelevant. Orwell was very rarely right about anything, but he was right about the biggest thing, the climax and point of his great “prophetic” work—and that’s why it’s the1984quote that no one ever quotes: “Do it to Julia!”Right accelerationism, from um-um-um-um-umming Nick Land explainers to comment-section wishes that “we” be hurt more and more until finally we rise up—when we all know that wewon’t—is exemplary.

                    WWI to the end of WWIIDisagree. Even in the depths of the Depression people largely were fed and housed. Russia and Germany in recent history and many examples before and since indicate hunger and poverty are about the only reasons people rebel. Deprivation alone can be managed but only to a point. While the trope about peasant revolts failing is superficially true, the rogue elites only overcome ruling factions when there is sufficient cannon fodder, and that only materializes if life is miserable. It has happened all through history.The Depression did lay the foundation for the total state, but it also was an acknowledgement that crumbs had to be thrown to keep a lid on things.I don’t follow you on how people will embrace systems if they hurt others. It is true, but how does that make them overlook personal hunger and exposure? Truly interested in understanding that aspect of your reply.

                    Hemid’s important point though, is the driving power of luxury beliefs.Remember, it’s only a transient fad, and only becomes a true luxury belief, when it extracts a painful cost on one’s lessers.
It proves itself as a status marker of real power when you can hurt someone without retribution.
A status marker is important only to those around you, whom you know and who know you.  Alphas at the top of the tree have a limited vision of only their near competitors.  The lessers in the lower branches are mere scenery or a statistic.

        “… so maybe it can last.”The hard limit to how long the crazy can last is population replacement to the point where the shooters of the klown world empire do not exercise armed control. The case of theVenezuelan gangin Aurora, Colorado is a metastasizing seed of what is to come.An area gets filled with aliens. None of the aliens have the slightest respect for rule of law of any kind, except for that of the jungle. Some of them are armed and impose their own order at gunpoint. We call them ‘gangs’ as if the mere label makes them different from any diverse police force. There aren’t any Americans around to contest them, because we all left.Klown world shooters working for state and imperial government agencies are too busy protecting the oligarchs and their servants to spend resources exercising control over alien populations whose only purpose is to be showered with fiat welfare money to buy goods and services from transnational corporations. The oligarchs are happy as long as the fiat money is instantiated and distributed, then spent nourishing their transnational institutions. Who exercises local control is irrelevant to the oligarchs, as long as the aliens all agree (at least implicitly) to use Shlomo’s international financial system.Besides, these aliens are by any metric, including their own, not Americans, so exercising sovereignty over them would be racist colonial imperialism. The little patches of land on which they live will expand, eventually joining together in a multiethnic jigsaw puzzle of warring micropolities which have only two commonalities: a shared currency and a shared welfare system.Collapse is the cure, and pitiless reconquest will be righteous justice.

            There is simply no percentage in enforcing the law against these people. Any move against them would be just a sunk cost, with no ROI. On the other hand, think about the largely middle class J6ers, and how much in fines, asset seizures, legal fees and court costs their prosecutions have generated.

            Spot on, great comment. People must strive to be in one of the jigsaw pieces populated and protected by their own. Fragmentation and dissolution are well underway already, and all the Glorious Five-Year plans in the world cannot stop it. Those Venezuelan gangs in Colorado, by the way, are just the logical extension of the narcostates forming to the south on the border. There are neighborhoods in the shadow of D.C. run by these types, too. I wish them happy hunting in the nearby Imperial City and hope and expect their operational capacities will expand in the near future to Martha’s Vineyard, Silicon Valley, and lower Manhattan. Numerica is the land of opportunity now for armed sociopaths and assorted violent criminals with a larger footprint than an AI image. Numerica is neither a nice place to visit nor live. Just ask those who brought it to fruition and who live as far as possible from their life project.

            Yes. Note the police are happy to show up at your doorstep for any of the various pretexts they use and kill you if they see a gun even if it is held at your side.   However they seem reluctant to engage criminals openly marauding through private property armed with long guns.

                    As soon as an immigrant, legal or illegal, arrives in this country, they qualify for all sorts of public spending on food, housing, Obamaphone, medical assistance – GDP line goes up. If they have kids, the kids go to school at $XK in funding per – GDP line goes up and teacher’s union gets that much more power. They can get all sorts of lines of credit that really makes you an American in 2024 – credit card, auto loan, the whole deal. All that stuff creates more money out of thin air, which makes GDP line go up. If they use a stolen Uber account to deliver food, that makes line go up and makes more money for the big company.I think it is wayyyyy more than $1500 to MegaCorp and they feel *none* of the downstream negative impacts. I think it is why state governments like CA and NY keep coming up with new ways to hand money over to illegals, it all helps the lines go up.

            For all the headlines painting Aurora as a previously peaceful suburb impacted by Denver’s sanctuary policies . . . bullshite.  Even back in 2020 the place was only 61% White, and 20% were foreign born.  Mestizos are not White.  They do not create functional, lawful societies.  But don’t worry, it won’t get this bad in your nice suburb, because . . . reasons.

        When you think about the freaks that spoke at the RNC convention you realize we are all in on this. 1985 me would never believe the spectacle of modern politics would look anything like this. I guess I can take solace in that Trump is just  a Bullshitter with some good leadership qualities. As I was telling my old special forces and astronaut buddies the other day, there is nothing authentic anymore.

                The RNC was, unbelievably, more of a freak show than the DNC. I am paraphrasing, but Nick Fuentes said the RNC was a bunch of freaks talking about normal things and the DNC was a bunch of normal people talking about freakish things. He nailed it. The RNC was really, truly strange and it was like they were bending over backwards to convince the spiteful mutants to come support them.

                    Yep. For some strange reason, they were appealing to the freak show and spitting in the fact of their voters. Again, I didn’t watch, but the speakers weren’t just bizarre, they were calculated to insult the audience.

                        When Reagan was running for governor even, much less later for President, the question spoken was about the specter of a grade B movie actor being qualified to run for election and lead. At least we had some prior vetting with a term in office as governor.Now we see Hulk Hogan being given a speaker spot at the RNC to perform his tired old schtick of ripping off his t-shirt and screaming at the audience. But why not, his hero, Trump, got into the same business himself before running for President with Ed McMahon, owner of the WWF—or have we forgotten.The whole business of democracy now is really show business, an act put on “every period of years” for the rubes. We were much better off in the Middle Ages where actors were (rightly) considered a step about prostitutes in the social hierarchy of the day.

                                Ironic isn’t it?  The MA lead—through harsh Darwinian selection—to the Industrial Revolution, which in turn shortly thereafter lead to a cessation of Darwinian selection, a decreasingly fit (smart as well as healthy) population, and now portends the very collapse of Western society.
It took a millennium or so after the “Dark Age” to reach the Industrial Age, but a little more than 200 years to get to where we are now.

                                    Right. And I think you could foreshorten it further still. For while anti-Darwinian conditions have reigned for about 150 years, it’s only over the course of the last 60 years that their dysgenic effects have manifested fully. Western Civilization–over two millennia to build and half a century to destroy.

Maybe. Would an evolutionary dead end recognize the truth before it dies out? Or would it wither away? Some extinction events play out over the course of years, others over generations.

                                    Thought we’d seen the end of Darwinian selection, too, but recently another thought has been rattling around in my head. Maybe we are seeing the exascerbation of that process. Where it goes asymptotic.
Clearly white virtues as DR sees them are maladaptions to the current environment. Maybe the question is not how we can get normie to see the light, but rather how we can change the environment to favor those things we value?
Or we could just die out, I guess.

                                    Those two things may indeed be incompatible. Male hierarchy is necessary to crawl out of the primordial goo and compose the 5th Symphony, but it spontaneously collapses when everybody has an icebox full of lasagna and unlimited access to girls doing unspeakable things in front of the camera.

                        I’m still amazed that the GOP was this open about putting on a freakshow. I mean with the tranny stuff raging people are still looking for an alternative to the Democrats’ culture war on everything decent. How did the top Goopers not realize that the whole show they put on would enrage their own voters? I expect degeneracy and celebration of everything stupid and immoral from the Democrats but until I found out about the GOP convention I still thought the GOP was at least still pandering to sensible, conservative people.

                    The DNC had the Central Park 5 gang rapists speaking.  There is not a single person in the elite who believe their BS “I dindu Nuffin” routine. All are guilty as sin.  The movie made about them is even more at odds with realty than the conventions.

                        I think I missed that part. Maybe they put them up early (and yes they were all guilty). Obviously the story about them is fake, but in 2020 they got the racial injustice angle, the White lady tears angle (the prosecutor was a White lady, actually a fellow-White, but no matter), and the muh evil Drumpf all in one story.I certainly wouldn’t say that my characterization is universal. The Democrats are the party of the spiteful mutants, after all. Yet the DNC made a concerted effort to hide that part of it. Even when it came to their most horrific policy (endless abortion on demand), they focused on normal people, like White women with White husbands, who had to get what they deem was medically necessary abortion. The RNC by contrast let their freak flag fly.I know most people here did not watch them both, and honestly that was a smart move for your sanity. But I did, and the contrast between the two was really bizarre.

                            I didn’t watch either. I only saw bits and pieces from people uploading the clips for the purpose of criticism.
One of the gang rapists, the guy who was beating people with the pipe (as testified by many others) is now either a city councilman or in either state or fed legislature. They called him a representative of Harlem. Each one got multiple millions.  It’s absolutely disgusting.

                                If only Bernie Goetz took walks in Central Park instead of riding the subway…. 😉
Of course, that wouldn’t happen.  It only happens in movies like Death Wish.  Even as a young boy in NYC, everyone knew that Central Park after dark was a “no go” zone.  The only folks entering the park after dark were themselves of criminal ilk, or simply oblivious dolts.
The “gang of five” even if not responsible for the alleged rape were simply up to no good.  Of course, if one believes George Floyd was “wronged”, then one can believe anything.

                                    Not only did they do the rape, they were also beating and robbing people.  In their own words, they were “wilding.”  That was their primary reason for being there.All their confessions are on youtube.  Each one saying ‘I was there, but I was doing this lesser thing (fondling her breasts, holding her legs down…). But my friends, they were the ones actually raping’  One of them even said “this was my first rape”There was also forensic evidence against them.  They only even came to the attention of the cops because the woman managed to badly scratch one of their eyes.

                                        But as I read, the *real* rapist confessed and he was connected with DNA evidence to the rape.  The City doesn’t pay $41M without an airtight case of false imprisonment.  Again, nothing says these 5 were little more than criminals, just that there were enough holes in the case that should have been picked up on and avoided.  No expert here, but ChatGPT summarizes as follows:”…Exoneration:•	The True Perpetrator: In 2002, Matias Reyes, a convicted serial rapist and murderer who was already serving a life sentence, confessed to the crime. His DNA matched the evidence found at the crime scene, and he provided details of the assault that only the perpetrator could have known. After Reyes’s confession, the Manhattan District Attorney’s office conducted an investigation that corroborated his account and found that he had acted alone.•	Vacating the Convictions: Following Reyes’s confession and the new evidence, the convictions of the Central Park Five were vacated in December 2002. The boys, now men, were exonerated after spending between 6 and 13 years in prison.…”

                    I didn’t watch the whole thing, or even all that much really (who could bring themselves to) but the impression I got was that it was supposed to represent the triumphant pajeet takeover of the GOP, and Trump wasn’t supposed to be there. I’m not saying I believe that, I certainly wasn’t expecting that ahead of time, it’s just the impression I got.

                    It’s a reflection of reality. Dem is a hypocrite, Rep tries too hard to be cool. Very white, very middle class phenomena. It’s still middle whitey’s country. That we’re told otherwise is what makes it look bizarre.
edit: maybe the fundamentals (the people) are that strong, maybe that’s why the show goes on, maybe it would be an easier mess to clean up than it seems. Haven’t quite reached the tipping point? Idk.

                    In a way, it makes sense: The RNC base is normal, so to attract “new” voters you need to put on spiteful mutant show; the DNC base is spiteful mutants, so to attract new voters you need to put on a normie show (of sorts).
It is about poaching the other side’s tepid voters.

                    As I mentioned many times, the Indians are coming. Right now, they know that the Jews run the show, but, unlike whites, they just look at Jews as another tribe. They’ll bow down before them for now, but the Indians are working hard to create their own power base and funding.King Cobra and other Indians will not be satisfied as well-paid help. He wants a seat at the table, but he knows that the Jews likely won’t give it to him, so the Indians are building their own table.Of course, whites, being the rubes that we are, are oblivious to it all. My goodness.

                        Read into how the Indians took over the Antwerp Diamond Trade and pushed the juice out. Anyone who thinks they aren’t going to try to do that everywhere is not paying attention. The top of the heap Indians like King Cobra are (A) very intelligent, (B) tribal with a very high in-group preference, and (C) have a religious and cultural heritage that leads them to believe their DNA is blessed. In other words, they aren’t that different from their competition, except there are a lot more of them.

                            Exactly.  India is a subcontinent of *many* peoples.  There are a few “high caste” populations that have done very well there.  For example, “…the Parsis, also known as Zoroastrians, are sometimes referred to as the “Jews of India.” This comparison is drawn because, like the Jewish community, the Parsis are a small, close-knit minority group with a distinct religious and cultural identity. Both communities have historically played influential roles in commerce, industry, and philanthropy, despite their small numbers.”I’ve encountered many Indians in my time at the university, don’t underestimate them.  They are a cut above what they left back in India.

            Having an actor running as President did seem a little weird in 1979, but by 1991, the dems briefly dreamed of Jerry Brown/Linda Ronstadt in the White House and Arnold seemed a natural fit as Gov of CA. Twelve years from now, Paris Hilton’s purse dog will be fit for the All-Important Smashing of the Glass Ceiling.
Speaking of astronauts, will Elon please send that lady astronaut a rubber band for her space mop?

        Amanda Gorman, official poet of the US – what a joke.  Though hardly an expert, I would guess poetry’s zenith was the 19th and early 20th centuries.  It’s been in decline for a long time, and now with a magical negro exclamation point to highlight its utter demise.  Just another worthless black that White libs**** can wet their pants over.  This day and age is sooooooooooo pathetic.

        &gt;Amanda Gorman, the official poet of the United States, whose poetry is nothing more thanemotive nonsense. As John Derbyshireobserved, it fails to qualify as poetry. It is why an incoherent simpleton like Kanye West can pretend to be a genius musician, despite lacking a shred of musical ability.If you read Kanye lyrics and then Amanda, it’s clear Kanye is the far superior artist. No, this is not praise of Kanye.Amanda Gorman is the comfortable black woman for white progressives in this generation, and took up the mantle Maya Angelou left. Her job is far easier too, since there used to be a small poetry subculture in years past, but now no one cares about poetry anymore.

                Kanye started out as a part of the corporate machine, doing the work that gets credited (by the public) to celebrities (actual credits are accurate legal documents). He was greatly oversold for a while, but he had a real gift. His talent as a producer was for having somewhat odd taste that “resonates with” fans of normal boring pop rap. He was every poser executive and aspirational consumer’s dream: corporate avant-garde.One of his crimes was that he could finish a whole production just screwing around with his friends, the business had obligated itself to sell whatever he made, and whatever he made sold by the ton. He was such a sure thing he was effectively “outside pissing in.”Was. Then some things happened.

            Another odd thing about Timmah: If Walz actually likens himself to Elmer Fudd he’s actually highlighting his bad 2A stances. In the gun world, a “Fudd” is the kind of gun owner who is very proud of owning “hunting” weapons that don’t look scary and is just fine with banning the “assault” guns that are often even the same models as the ones he owns but with different trim and furnishings. In other words, he’s either a hypocrite, an idiot, or both.

        I come for the commentary; I stay for the quips (There is nothing authentic about Harris, not even her DNA – hehehe).Several months ago, I was teaching poetry.I was really pleased that, when I exposed many young folk (for the first time with depth) to the quality of some of the great poets (Yeats, Frost, Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Byron, Browning, Milton, etc.), they picked up and independently analyzed a classic work of his or her selection.I am thinking specifically of Robert Frost, possibly due to inaugural readings. You contrast even some of Frost’s lesser works with the absolute garbage that was the Biden inaugural poem, and you cannot help but recognize that the world has lost its objective mind. Frost, much like Gorman, used an assumed identity (for Frost, it was New Englander; Gorman, “Black”), but he at least did so with substance and style. The slick emotive veneer that Gorman employs, as Derb noted in that link, does not stand up to even the most cursory of readings. Poe was sonorific, possibly at the cost of depth (see Yeats), but at least the poem stands up to scrutiny, partly because of Poe’s brilliant mastery of metre. And then you read something akin to “Nothing Gold Can Stay,” and I cannot help but think of how far our art has degraded in 100 years. Perhaps the poem illustrates in practice our downfall, and discusses in content the inevitability. I don’t memorize too many poems, but I definitely memorized this one:Nature’s first green is goldHer hardest hue to holdHer early leaf’s a flowerBut only so an hourThen leaf subsides to leafSo Eden sank to griefSo dawn goes down to dayNothing gold can stay.Contrast with:There’s a poem in Charlottesvillewhere tiki torches string a ring of flametight round the wrist of nightwhere men so white they gleam blue—seem like statueswhere men heap that long wax burningever higherwhere Heather Heyerblooms forever in a meadow of resistance.Sigh…

            What I perceive you describe—and decry—are the lack of “rules” for this new type of “poetry”.  Not only is this new stuff no longer rule based, it does not even acknowledge a very good understanding of the English language and vocabulary.  Simply a stream of consciousness. A blithering psychotic in an asylum can produce much the same as we see here.
One only need read, “The Lays of Ancient Rome” written by Thomas Babington Macaulay—published in 1842–to see my point.  Warning, to read such is to heighten despair wrt our present day decline as a society.

                I think the lack of rules are indicative of a lack of substance and skill. The Wasteland typically is in free verse, but it still has the clear marks of learning and discipline and depth. Eliot is far from my favorite, but I cannot ignore that there is something beyond emotive babbling.

        if some Ashkenazi from Ukraine can magically turn himself into an Israeli of the Bible by converting to Judaism and learning Hebrew and convincing outsiders with such a story, then why can’t a man become a woman?  Come up with a story about hormones or how you were born a boy in a girl’s body.  If it’s all the mind, then why not?This is the mindset that rules our country because the liars are in charge, and every goy who wants to get ahead and has to come up with lies of their own.

        Why is the war in Ukraine important? Because the West needs to loot it in order to keep the plates spinning for a few more years. Once Blackrock is denied access by Putin’s military, the house of cards begins its downfall. The Euro dies first and the EU Central Banks go down with it. Reality then becomes a cruel bitch and the audience in the political theater start throwing rotten vegetables at the actor politicians. Then it’s either instigate nuclear Armageddon or unleash the Africans to reek havoc. Anything to distract from economic disaster. Buckle up, rocky road up ahead.

        This reminds me of the old Air Force joke about why the engineers wanted a monkey along with the astronaut in the NASA tests. The monkey’s job was to bite the man if he tried to override the program and actually fly the spaceship. The whole thing has been programmed behind the scenes by nerds working for oligarchs. The media is there to bite any “politician” actually trying to govern. I think Zman would call this the triumph of managerialism.

The UK had a similar black poet a while back too, he may have been worse than the US version, always on the telly with his boring and predictable opinions
Since the US and UK have their terrible black poets. I assume we will have one in Ireland soon enough

            She’s 26 now, was 22 when asked to read her “poetry” at Biden’s inauguration. Was chosen as the first “youth poet laureate” of Los Angeles when she was 16. Got her first book published at 17. And a negro. Guarantee you she thinks she got there on natural talent.

        When the masses can be fully placated and narcotized by the carnival, it only stands to reason that the vast majority of public figures, especially in politics and show biz, are fictive carnival freaks. The subjects of AINO are such a degraded and easily amused lot that they’re getting what they deserve and they like it. And that, I’m afraid, is why Insane Clown World is not yet running on vapor.

Those were halcyon days.  What we see here today is the homage “mediocrity” still pays “meritocracy”. Soon that too will be gone as the last vestiges of a dying society forgets what meritocracy even is among the populace.

            Just wanted to mention that I hope everyone reads the link Z provided to that piece of short fiction. 25 pages is a very light lift. I marvel at how prescient many of our forebears were in their speculative fiction and predictions of how awful the future could truly become.
That one for being written in 1909 hits scarily close to the mark of what the world is starting to closely resemble.

            Point taken, but are you really going to say the amount of falsehood generated around Vance is comparable to Kamala?
I think that you’ll find that many here hate both parties, but for different reasons.  I certainly do.  Nonetheless, the media maelstrom of mendacity manufactured for Kamala is truly unprecedented, to the point of being physically disorienting to me.
The media has obviously decided to generate an alternative reality and substitute it for the real one.  Is the sky still blue?  Does 1 + 2 still equal 3?  I honestly don’t know.

The presidential campaign still has over two months to run.  It’s possible the Harris campaign will eventually have Timmy play dress-up and insist everyone address xir as “Tammy” in an effort to gin up voter turnout in blue precincts, where they think those sort of hijinks are “brave and amazing.”

        People used to downplay, deflect or try to deny embarrassing things about politicians they liked but now its very common for them to claim anything to the contrary is fake news without flinching. This isn’t exclusive to leftists either, during the Trump era people routinely lied through their teeth about him even though it would’ve been beneficial to criticize him.Its like the masses have come under a spell of toxic positivity where everyone pretends they exist in an alternate universe where rainbows beam out their eyeballs &amp; anyone who points out observable reality is the personification of evil who must be stopped. This always existed to a degree but now we’re at the point where people will point to the sky &amp; claim its neon pink then call you a loon for saying it’s blue.Underneath it all it feels like a mix of extreme desperation, coping &amp; Stockholm syndrome. It’s like people cracked &amp; are disassociating from reality in a twisted &amp; depressed mirroring of the detachment the narcissistic idiots running the West are experiencing.

        from Livys war with Hannibal ; book xxvii.
Rome’ consuls Nero and Livius were about to engage Hasdrubal, Hannibal s brother. A lot was riding on this battle and so the mood in Rome was tense…The senators and people never leave the forum and:
(t)he women of Rome, helpless as they were for any practical purpose, turned themselves to passionate prayer, wandering from shrine to shrine, and giving the gods no rest from their vows and supplications.

            My only bone with it is Kamaltoe is not hapa (half White, half Asian).  But I get the temptation for alliteration.
Half-wit is more accurate but too generous.

                Maybe his YT feed is similar to mine. Yesterday they had a video “celebrating” all the dead influencers who were doing the “fat is beautiful” shtick. Then again I’m a heartless bastard who likes cruel stuff like that. If we all had to pour out a 40 every time a fat black rapper died, we’d need a case of St. Ides every week. Between the gunfire and the fried chicken few of these guys will make 50.
