        They can switch jobs, they just have to have the new company sponsor them, and the green card time process starts anew.I think we’re due for a bubble bursting in Silicon Valley.  Using this article as a reference:http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/magazine/silicon-valleys-youth-problem.htmlIn tech, you can either go work for companies that make infrastructure(Cisco as an example), or you can go work for some app company. (This is an oversimplification of course) The young people want to go work for the latter.  I work in the former, and it’s true that it’s hard to find young people/millenials that want to do something non-glamorous.  Instead they’d rather be ‘changing the world’ with some app that revolutionizes dog-walking, or solves some other trivial problem urban hipster problem.So from what I see, we bring in plenty of H1B folks, as working on infrastructure software is considered boring grunt work, and they’re more than willing to do it of course and are qualified to do so just by sheer brute force numbers.  India’s population being what it is.  This can’t go on of course, eventually the VC money going to 22 year olds is going to dry up.  I foresee a crash and many out of work app developers in the coming future.  They’ll be forced to try their hand at other less glamourous areas of tech.  They’ll hit a snag though when they see the jobs have all been taken or outsourced already though.

        Oh, and one more thing…  as long as we America keeps hoovering up the top .1% of the rest of the world, they ain’t going to fix their own problems.  They should be leading change and producing wealth in their home countries, not slaving for corporate America.

        Why aren’t we calling the H1B visa program what it really is?  Bonded labor and a violation of the 13th Amendment.  Poor Rajiv or Zhu get picked up for a STEM job and they are indentured servants until they get their green card or decide to go home.  They can’t change jobs.  They get paid below market.  If they complain about pay or working conditions, they get canned and sent home.  I’ve worked in a company where one of the divisions had become an H1B sweatshop.  Everyone was miserable.  Most were doing substandard work.  Our competitors in this area mopped the floor with us.  It wasn’t good for them, the shareholders, or the rest of us.  Their presence just pumped up earnings for a few years as our cash cows slowly became dogs and we failed to launch any of the new technologies we needed to stay competitive.

        The flip side of this however:  I applied for a position over at Roku for a position, I was absolutely perfect for(on paper anyway).  Sure enough, I got a call back from their internal recruiter right away.The recruiter was from India, and spoke poor english.  She had a hard time comprehending my skillset and experience.  She mixed up the position I was interested in, for a different one.  Of course, she gave me the “We will consider you for other positions” rejection line at the end of the call.I spoke with some other colleagues, and they have seen the same thing too.  There is speculation that many of the Indian recruiters, will deliberately be obtuse and difficult for non-Indian candidates, so they can claim that they tried to hire native Americans, but just couldn’t find any with the right qualifications…

            A cou8ple of years ago a firm was finally prosecuted for fraud over this. They were hired to recruit for tech firms. They would place ads in trade publications, round up resumes and screen applicants. They would report back to the hiring firm. Of course, they never could find enough local talent. This fact was used by the tech firms to get more H1B1 visas.
It turns out the firm was never placing the ads or screening applicants. It was a scam.

        I work in tech, and have multiple H1B folks on my own team. (Note, I’m an individual contributor, not a manager).The hard part about all this at least from my corner of the tech world, is that engineers are not fungible.  That is to say, software is so specialized, you can’t take someone experienced in say SaaS and then ask to go work on custom linux kernels.  Even though they are both classified as software engineers, they may as well be in completely different fields.I don’t know if companies need to be more flexible or what, as obviously you’re not going to find your perfect candidate for a given position.
