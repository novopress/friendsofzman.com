        Why are they not in jail?
Simple: there are two Americas…. one with laws for you and me, and one with laws for those in power.  This has always been the case to some degree; the difference now is that those in power don’t even care to disguise that fact.
In a more thoughtful, civilized country even if no laws were broken (Gobsmacker’s point), there certainly would be resignations and terminations at the CIA simply due to the impropriety of it all.
We’re not that America any more.

        What laws were broken?  Offhand, none that I can see. The agency and the Senate committee had come to an arrangement by which committee staffers could view secret documents using the computers that were provided by, set up by, and run by the CIA at CIA HQ.  So the CIA violated this gentlemen’s agreement.  Did the agreement include a penalty clause?  Not likely.  Not to defend the CIA, but Feinstein is just bloviating.
