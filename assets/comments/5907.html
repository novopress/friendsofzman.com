        Dear Z,Have been reading your articles for some time now.I think you are quite brilliant.This latest – “My Theory of Everything: Part IV” – is even more brilliant than usual.I think you are quite right.Absent an existential threat or need to expand geographically, we have become the nation you describe.We can only pray that this time around the Puritan/Yankee/Progressive crowd receives a defeat commensurate with their hubris.Thank you for your clear mind and excellent writing ability.

        Few writers can see over the horizon and make sense of what gathers there. Mr. Z is one of the few. The very few.

        Z-man:  This one should have been titled“The Ascent of the Cloud People, the Early Years.”The author couches his argument in terms of the diverging per capita incomes in U.S. cities, but he is really chronicling the rise of the elites as they successfully lobbied for the repeal (or reinterpretation) of laws that promoted small businesses and discouraged monopoly formation.This is the question I keep asking myself: Would the elites, having harnessed Promethean power, and seeing themselves as an “elect,” bring down Promethean fire upon their perceived enemies if they thought they were about to lose power?  Most of the ones I know seem just kooky enough to push the button labelled “Gotterdammerung” and take the rest of us with them if they thought their little party was about to end.

        Z, this is an astonishingly good metaview of US history in just a few hundred words. I would only add that the progressives greatest victory was the final overthrow of the old Constitution and the founders ideal of limited government in a bloodless coup during the reign of FDR, and its replacement by the ever-burgeoning administrative state through which the progressive utopia will one day be realized.  That utopia, as currently defined, is one in which all society will be rendered, once and for all, into a “safe space” devoid of bad thoughts and bad thinkers.If you haven’t read them, you and your readers may find the following interesting:The Rise and the Rise of the Administrative State:http://www.nesl.edu/userfiles/academics/Friedman/THE%20RISE%20AND%20RISE%20OF%20THE%20ADMINISTRATIVE%20STATE.pdfandThe Transformation of Liberalism, 1964 to 2001http://www.nationalaffairs.com/public_interest/detail/the-transformation-of-liberalism-1964-to-2001andThe Post-Protestant Ethic and Spirit of Americahttp://www.aei.org/publication/the-post-protestant-ethic-and-spirit-of-america/They confirm much of what you have outlined above so succinctly.

        “We are in the down side of a very long cycle that is now heading for an end.”In Europe, and perhaps across the pond, we are heading for a new Dark Age. Western Europe will undergo huge changes, and progress will become a matter of staying alive until the next harvest and hoping that the walls hold out.If it is one consolation, then it is all the self-obsession and whining, the crackpot non-thoughts of lazy lefties and the whole of the the brain-dead celeb culture, will be gone.So too will many millions of people disappear who didn’t deserve to be fooled and used and ignored, though many of them naively went along with it all because there were free things (of no importance whatsoever) on offer in exchange for a small cross on a piece of paper. There will be survivors, and they will vow we never go back to the times that led to the fall.Sadly, humans being humans will gradually after many, many years — but only after a renaissance — slowly begin to return to stupidity, vanity and deceit. So it goes, and so we go.

        As everyone else has said, this is a very well thought out summation of our present times. My favorite line from your essay is this one:
“This time the plague walks on two feet and demands to go on the dole.”– Damn, that is beautifully expressed and I wish I had thought of it first!

        A “completed” NWO may well be another “Tower of Babel” ; an unaccomplished monument to hubris, but a NWO failure will result in another feudal dark age.If a NWO is “successful” ………. then nation states go the way of tribes into history and some form of cohesive tyranny must enforce compliance.And at some point revolts emerge to start it all over againI am a resistor to the emerging USSA, which will lead IMO, to a regional break up of our Empire, and may well help, inadvertently, the NWO creation.But a simple mind like mine must take one step at a time and the tyranny in my face must be confronted and defeated, what comes next is what comes next and up to the next generation.

        “The dream of global government where ruling elites are untethered from national loyalties will never materialize.”  That won’t stop them from giving it their all to bring about this dystopia.  I think they will get to some middle stage of cooperative regional feudalism. Democracy is all but dead in Europe and near dead in the US.

        My only objection is the minor mention of the War of 1812, initiated by the US to erase a plausible threat to the north from the power the US had just separated from 36 years earlier. Britain was thoroughly tied up dealing with Napoleon, so it seemed an opportunity. Except the US has never much liked overtly starting wars, so this understandably ended in a draw. So this doesn’t fit the role you assigned it. But in a way it proves your point in other ways, that the USA never developed an imperial attitude, not even with this venture. And perhaps this accounts for America’s schizophrenic to-and-fro between the 2 parties.

        –“It did not take long before the people understood it was their destiny to conquer the continent.”–
A little late to the party but if the above quote is accurate we still have some work to do.Only question is what to do with all those useless Canucks and Mexicans?
