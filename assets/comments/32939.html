        A much bigger question than ‚ÄúWill there be shenanigans‚Äù is ‚ÄúWill someone more competent than a mongoloid on a slanted roof take another shot at Trump‚Äù? He‚Äôs going to need the papal plexiglass bubble from now on. He might also want to keep someone around as a burger-tester, maybe Lloyd Austin or Mark Miley since both men look like they can put them away.If I were one of Trump‚Äôs enemies right now, I would frankly be very, very worried about the possibility of him being killed. Trump is the first American politician in my lifetime‚Äîmaybe the only one‚Äîto have genuine organic support among the people.I personally hope that Trump turns out to be motivated primarily by a desire for revenge, that all the paranoid fantasies of the Dems are realized in early January. The idea of seeing Rachel Maddow manacled in some rat-infested Bastille warms the cockles of my heart. Actually, if Trump were to deport everyone at MSNBC, the New York Times, and The Atlantic, quite a few of America‚Äôs problems would go away. One sh*tlib or neocon does more damage than a thousand Venezuelan gangbangers, or a hundred Haitians roasting Jack Russel terriers over rotisserie spits.It‚Äôs all frankly sad, as it really didn‚Äôt have to come to this. There are far fewer Halloween decorations around my neighborhood this year than last, or the year before that. You know people‚Äôs faith / the social capital is at an all-time low when people can‚Äôt even work up enthusiasm for Halloween. Then again, because my ‚Äòhood is working class, people actually have to budget those big lawn displays and plastic pumpkins filled with candy into their budgets. This is of course misinformation, though, as Paul Krugman informs us the economy is thriving. My misinformation is also, no doubt, anti-Semitic.As to whether or not political violence is on the horizon, we‚Äôll know soon enough. If antifa begins rioting, causing billions of dollars of damage and razing cities to rubble, we‚Äôll know everything‚Äôs a-okay. If some grandmas in their Rascal mobility scooters with little American flag pendants start going to the Capitol to protest the results of the election, we‚Äôll know we‚Äôre in the grips of fascism.

                Spent the weekend with the folks:  They watch Newsmax.
Agitprop?  Of course!
Also:  no race mixing or non-traditional couples in the advertisements.
So that was nice.

                    In chess terms, normies are the pawns. And as any good chess player knows, pawns, when used correctly, are the most powerful pieces on the board. A bunch of normies showing up in the Capitol to take selfies scared our rulers more than decades of Larping by the Richard Spencer / Stormfront types. There‚Äôs a lesson there for anyone not too daft. Forgive me for sounding a little Frank Capra-ish/Pollyannaish (Christmas is still a couple months away) but honest and decent people can defeat powerful forces if those forces have grown degenerate and lazy enough in their corruption. We seem to be reaching some kind of push-comes-to-shove inflection point moment.

They possibly can, but it requires them to do nothing.  Literally.  As in completely drop out of the society run by those forces. Out of their economy (a particularly difficult one), social circles, volunteer organizations, entertainment industry, etc.
It‚Äôs lot harder to do ‚Äúnothing‚Äù than you think it is.  Possibly the best ‚Äúbang for the buck‚Äù dropping out is military service (voluntary or conscripted, although I think conscripted would concern them more).

                            But it‚Äôs ‚Äúhard to do‚Äù for a reason. Doing nothing sucks.We are social creatures. We love our families and communities. We want them to do well and thrive. We don‚Äôt want to abandon them.Doing literally nothing is really not possible.  In order to support yourself, you have to pay taxes and support them. Such a large portion of our enemies either work directly for some level of government, or at most 2 connections away from directly working for government.  Take HR workers. Theoretically they work mostly in the private sector. But if not for government regulations and rules, there would be no need for a big HR department.  They are parasites.I‚Äôd like to see mass peaceful orderly protests in places like DC with at least a million people carrying plastic toy pitchforks and LED battery operated torches.  How would they react to such a symbolic protest, I have no idea.  But it would send the message that patience is wearing thin.

                That‚Äôs the social element I mentioned. Robert Putnam, author of ‚ÄúBowling Alone‚Äù noted the ‚Äútrick or treater‚Äù effect, but of course had to ignore the cause. He knew diversity and social cohesion are inversely correlated, but also knew he wanted to be put up in nice hotels and get decent speaking fees, and there‚Äôs only room in that ecosystem for one Charles Murray.

        It‚Äôs likely the last real presidential election for legacy Americans. The demographics and voter fraud will be too much to overcome for any GOP candidate in four years, certainly in eight.The Harris campaign is run by incompetents, while Harris is stunningly terrible. Even Dems acknowledge this. Trump is the finest campaigners since, at least, Reagan. Yet, the race is still a toss-up.What happens in four years when you have more typical candidates? What happens in four years when Georgia, Virginia and Arizona are all a bit more Hispanic? What happens as white Boomers die off?What happens is the GOP loses no matter what. Maybe, just maybe, the GOP can pull off one more victory after Trump, one last Hail Mary, but, overall, it will be over. At that point, we move toward the next chapter in American history, a chapter where legacy Americans are marginalized and no longer have a say in who becomes the president and, thus, the Supreme Court.In a very real sense, the America that‚Äôs existed since the 1600s will be over.

                        Texas was officially 39.7% non-hispanic White in 2020.  Today ‚Äì easily down to 36%.  All the old White repukes (backers of such ‚Äòstaunch‚Äô cuckservatards as Kay Bailey Hutchison, John Cornyn, and Greg Abbott) are dying off.  The state is chock full of Californians, Han, and subcons.  No way Texas ever secedes.

                            You saved me the trouble. I will note, though, that Texas is vast and large swathes of East Texas and West Texas are unlike the state as a whole, so that does not preclude intrastate troubles and friction. Also, as dismal as it is, the cartels could effectively come to control the Rio Grande Valley and perhaps Houston (this already is happening on a limited basis). Texas is a deeply troubled state but Austin, as is the case with D.C., may find itself limited in exerting complete authority.

                                That‚Äôs exactly right. We can write off the Metroplex, Houston, Austin and San Antonio. But West Texas and rural North Texas still have a very large white population and there are plenty of Messkins who would, I believe, support secession rather than continued subserviance to the Blackberry Fruitcake Empire. Texas as a whole probably won‚Äôt secede, but it may very well fracture and what its component parts do is anybody‚Äôs guess. At any rate, utterly declarative statements about a very murky future should be subject to extreme doubt.

                                    In addition to Texas, when you look at many if not most other states, you can see the same playing out. The first troubles, when they pop off, almost certainly will be intrastate. Places like Colony Ridge or the situation with Haitians in Ohio were supposed to mitigate the opposition, but over the long haul the invaders dumped into far-flung places will migrate to urban areas with more gibs. We absolutely are in uncharted water, but we can dimly see the lines developing. For all we know, to be clear, places being ungovernable are baked into the cake for the wannabe central planners.

Unfortunately, White hispanics (those with 85% or more European genetics) make up probably less than 10% of the hispanics in Texas.  So would bump it to 40% White at most.

                        As the federal govt becomes less competent and less respected by whites, I suspect that states or regions will take on more responsibilities. How far that goes is anyone‚Äôs guess.

                            Spot on. Equally importantly, the wherewithal for the juggernaut of a federal government won‚Äôt be there. Devolution is inevitable. At least to the level of individual states but possibly extending even further to more local modes of governance.

                        My prediction (which requires a hypothetical Trump victory) is that the first to go is Vermont. Or maybe Rhode Island. Perhaps even Oregon. Hawaii also a possibility. Heavy corporate presence in CA, WA, MA and other shitlib states would prevent them from seceding, at least initially.

            Seems to me that over decades political parties change their policies until they find something close to a 50%/50% split.  No party is currently advocating repatriation of blacks to Africa or women not being able to vote (unfortunately), because they would get 5% of the vote, although those were within the Overton Window in the past.  I‚Äôm having a hard time imagining exactly what policies the Republican party (or whatever the relatively right wing party is) will have to get ~50% of the vote in twenty years in a white-minority nation, but my guess is that they‚Äôll come up with something.

It will take decades for either party to fully realize that the Dems can‚Äôt lose the presidency. The GOP will simply think that it‚Äôs a bad run.

                    The Republican party is a national entity.  The California branch is more lib than the rest of the nation ‚Äì no one running for the state legislature in a city or suburb is going to rum on putting the ten commandments in school rooms, or even repealing gay marriage ‚Äì but isn‚Äôt going to have a completely different platform that the national one.  I imagine that if California seceded and became it‚Äôs own nation, Repubs and relatively moderate Dems would probably form a party with a platform (something like, smaller reparations) such that it captured about 50% of the vote, with more radical Dems (massive reparations) in the other half.

            This is a depressing prospect, but I think you‚Äôre right and it has me seriously considering what to do and where to go with the rest of my life.  In another 20 years, I‚Äôll be an old man.  The prospect of spending the last decade or two of my life where nothing works in a country that hates me has me seriously considering if it‚Äôs worth leaving now before things get much worse.  I know there really aren‚Äôt any good options as far as where to go, but I‚Äôve traveled enough to know that there are many places better than what the U.S. is today.  A part of me wants to stick around and fight because leaving feels weak, but the country seems too far gone for us to reverse any of the trends discussed daily on this blog.  There‚Äôs also the prospect of the government confiscating whatever wealth I have while persecuting me for any wrongthink.

                I think the best-case scenario is a complete collapse of the federal government and the states step in to take over most of its responsibilities, as the Founders intended. What reemerges is greatly weakened and stays in its lane (foreign policy, defense, coinage, etc).The worst-case scenario is nationwide anarcho-tyranny ruled by a certain small minority and administered by various dusky underlings. Imagine an incompetent and corrupt version of the Dominion from Star Trek DS9 with the tribe acting as the shape-shifting Founders, the talented tenth of various dusky Third Worlders as the Vorta and the sub-80 IQ remainder as Jem Hadar muscle to keep the rest of us in line.I‚Äôm personally hoping for option A. Let the shitlib states disintegrate into chaos.

                I know there really aren‚Äôt any good options as far as where to go, but I‚Äôve traveled enough to know that there are many places better than what the U.S. is today.I am unqualified to suggest what you should do, but I think there‚Äôs wisdom in comparing what you‚Äôve seen with your own eyes to the fear propaganda that American pop culture and news puts out in order to make us afraid of the rest of the world.  My first trip to Latin America came with severe culture shock, but the several subsequent trips have made it clear how unrealistic my initial risk assessment was.  Now it feels more like the America of my youth than this place.White civilization is headed to the dust bin, thanks to the (((usual suspects))).  We can go down fighting to the death, or we can accept it and do the best we can for ourselves.

                A part of me wants to stick around and fight because leaving feels weak, but the country seems too far gone for us to reverse any of the trends discussed daily on this blog. There‚Äôs also the prospect of the government confiscating whatever wealth I have while persecuting me for any wrongthink.You are 100% correct but read a couple posts here and you will see that there are 2 main elements at play here. Either a) people still holding onto some fantasy LARP ‚ÄúAlaska and Texas will secede from the Union‚Äú. Right  üôÑ  or 2) they are simply still in normiecon griller mode (Trump will save us!) in spite of all evidence pointing away from that being reality.At the end of the day it makes little difference whether you are self-deluded out of simple ignorance or existential terror it shows that even in dissident circles denial is strong AF. There is comfort in having hope, I get this, but no one is coming to save you.You sound like you have enough balls to take action and have a very sober and level headed understanding of the situation. I strongly advise you act on this.That paragraph I quoted in the opening you stated is my lived experience. I took a tremendous hit to my life and financial situation for nearly 10 years because I engaged in wrongthink in a extremely liberal hive zone. I was an ‚Äòearly adopter‚Äô of anarcho-tyranny that we now see writ large across everywhere including those poor f-ckers rotting in the dungeon in DC for the J6 debacle.I was extremely resentful when this happened to me, losing 10 of my primary earning years and becoming unemployable due to criminal charges because you had the temerity to verbally offend a brown person is a very bitter pill to swallow.  Today, I consider this a blessing in disguise because it gave me grim focus on a goal. Get out. Period. There is no future for the European descended in a place like that except as tax cattle and second class citizens. (See: South Africa)Also, there are nowhere near enough hard people to do the type of grim work required to right this ship which is another reason I simply opted out. Those few that take a principled stand receive NO support and are made example of. Why take the risk when you are surrounded by jellyfish and cowards? Like you, I have several decades to ‚Äúold age‚Äù and simply refuse to spend the ‚ÄòGolden Years‚Äô living as a hated minority in my own country surrounded by self-hating whites who gladly wear their chains.After nearly 5 years and tremendous effort and expense, I just completed my citizenship in a 2nd country and now have access to live in 27 other countries as well pretty much indefinitely. So for the US election, I hope we can do something dramatic and that Trump becomes the fascist they want him to be. If you are going to be accused of it anyways, may as well become the thing, right? But on the other hands, I spent 6 months this year living abroad and hearing different (European) languages so part of me has a ‚Äúnot my problem‚Äù outlook too.You will hear many people tell you (even some in this very topic) that things are f-cked all over the place and just as bad. That is a lie told by people who haven‚Äôt been anywhere. I have 6 stamps on my passport that tell a different story through lived experience. Are these perfect places? NO! There is no such a thing, you will trade one set of problems for another anywhere you go. But dodging omnipresent negro violence in every major city, a population that hates itself and wishes to commit slow suicide, and complete tribal control of the nation are not on the list in many places.

            ‚Äú‚Ä¶the race is still a toss-up‚Ä¶‚ÄùDon‚Äôt believe the polls.  That is the first problem.  They are all bought and paid for.  He who pays the piper calls the tunes, as they say.  You will in this week see them close in upon the winner.  That is because they are at this point ineffectual for what the were paid to ‚Äúpredict‚Äù and are attempting to recoup some semblance of credibility for the next electoral season.  This is common and understood.For example, in 2016, one national poll had Clinton 10-12 points ahead of Trump 10 days prior to Election Day, then began to issue updates showing Trump gaining.  By the day before election the had Clinton ahead by a couple of points‚Äîmargin of error.  Those in the business knew there was no such thing as such a change so fast in public opinion ever recorded‚Äîshort of a Black Swan event.

            The only way to prevent this is a massive deportation of all those here illegally or who have obtained citizenship fraudulently. This will require massive law enforcement, possibly the military, possibly lethal force, ignoring judicial orders, and arresting those who obstruct the process (including Republicans). It will require removing those in the federal bureaucracy who obstruct the process (there will be large numbers). The corporations that fund both parties will oppose the program. Does anyone think that Trump has the gonads implement such a plan? Remember, he couldn‚Äôt even deport the Dreamers, who are blatantly here illegally. Of course, his nitwit daughter and son-in-law would have the vapors he if he proposed such a plan and he listens to them and their stupid advice.

            2016 was the supposed to be the start of this shift, TV anchors openly gloated that changing demographics were making the GOP irrelevant. Bush was supposed to be the last white male president, ever.Trump threw a wrench in those plans by ignoring the normal GOP script, gaining millions of untapped working class white voters.By 2028 (unless Trump deports 40 million people), the demographics will be so dire that even with the working class whites coalition, the GOP will not be competitive.Trump himself is just a blip in the radar, but what he did do was stir up discontent among the white Dirt people. Whom were previously just sliding into irrelevancy in silence. It will be hard to put that anger back into the bottle. Trump will reverberate for at least a generation, but it remains to be seen what the impact is.

                Trump is inadvertently waking up a lot of whites to the fact that the system is rigged and hates them. So far, those whites remain good colorblind CivNats and only think of reforming the system. My suspicion is that they‚Äôll stay that way. They‚Äôll be Christopher Rufo types.

            What happens is the GOP loses no matter what.MHO: The pretense of the two party system is dropped and the GOP goes the way of the Whigs.  But, in its place, the Dems become like the Communist party (that is, officially there is one party, with various factions vying for power/position within).  In a sense, we already have that with both parts of the uni-party now.  In that case, everything shifts to the primaries as the consequential election, the main election being mostly for show if it continues at all. Of course, this is pretending that elections matter.I hear that in the before times, Texas had a very split Democrat party with a rather sizable conservative wing.Where to White man? Perhaps one of the Democrat factions that survives begins courting us.

                Not likely. The Dems, whatever wing, are the anti-Badwhite party. I suppose that it‚Äôs possible that a wing of the Dems could go after blue-collar voters, which would include whites, but there won‚Äôt be much enthusiasm.

        I‚Äôve posed this question to a lot of people, and havn‚Äôt received any halfway-decent responses. The U.S. has a $2 trillion dollar deficit sitting on top of a $35 trillion dollar national debt. It has persistently high inflation that it can‚Äôt solve without hiking interest rates much further, which it can‚Äôt do because then the economy would fall apart. 20 million illegals were let into the country in the last four years alone and there are 50+ million illegals overall.If Trump wins he will likely try for some actions ‚Äì there *is* a national level intra-elite competition happening, which is below the level of our international central bank owning financial class control which is unified ‚Äì but the fundamentals are locked in place. The Fed cannot raise rates and cannot lower them without major consequences. Trump will not evict 20 million illegals. In other words, his presidency if he wins will result in the continuation of neoliberal feudalism and a massive decline in people‚Äôs quality of life. If you have an argument against this, one that takes into account Trump‚Äôs first term (where the deficit ran at 1.5 trillion per year and he printed $11 trillion during fraudvirus and he evicted no one, where he pushed endless ‚Äúlegal‚Äù immigration) I am open to hearing it.This isn‚Äôt, of course, an argument in favor of the 90 IQ anti-white brown hooker, who is a joke of a candidate.My (quite pessimistic) analysis is here:https://neofeudalreview.substack.com/p/pre-election-framing-the-fifth-legal

                Yes, 100%. Remember the old saying , ‚ÄúBe careful what  you wish for because you might get it.‚Äù If Trump becomes president again it is difficult to see how he accomplishes any more than he did in his first term. The debt and the deficit and the 30 million illegals will not disappear on Inauguration Day, nor will the Deep State that successfully backstabbed him for the past eight  years.And about that wall he promised to build? LOL.Personally it has been my belief that they will let never him win again, either through voter fraud, an October Surprise, lawfare, or assassination. Or all of the above.I will nonetheless vote for him. If for no other reason it would be my middle finger to his enemies.

I go back and forth on this.  I understand the visceral hatred for him (or at least what he represents in their minds) is a strong force to stop his victory by any means necessary.
On the other hand, he does serve useful purposes ‚Äì especially for the tribe.  Also, if tptb still desire some buy-in of the normie public, letting him win might be a convenient relief valve. Who knows.

            Neo-Feudal, you are right:  These problems cannot be fixed.  But before the entire edifice collapses, a vote for Trump is a chance to give a middle finger to the folks who are responsible for the mess.

        When you‚Äôre running against Hitler you have a moral obligation to steal the election, with a clear conscience. Or, if you‚Äôre just saying he‚Äôs Hitler and don‚Äôt really believe it, then you‚Äôre a liar who is dishonest enough to steal an election. This was also true in 2020. Multiple D governed states, PA, MI, AZ, NC, and also R run GA have announced it will take days or weeks to count the vote. Does any R, let alone Trump, ever win when the counting takes days or weeks?OTOH Trump has always outperformed his polling, and this time his polling looks pretty good. And we get the signals from the clouds re: newspaper endorsements (isn‚Äôt it entertaining how much the priesthood at WaPo thinks their endorsement matters? How else will anyone know they are anti Trump?). It seems they will have a harder time convincing everyone it was legit if Harris wins than they did 4 years ago. So maybe they let him win and be the fall guy for the inevitable crash that‚Äôs coming. This view suggests, or requires, some ability to control the fraud from the top. But once you train and organize a democracy fortification army, you can‚Äôt just turn it off by flipping a switch. Unless you really do control the dominion machines.As I‚Äôve posted before, I‚Äôll vote Trump just to add one more to his popular tally, for the sole reason that this is the only legal means I possess to make shitlibs suffer. I do it for that reason alone. I don‚Äôt expect him to be able to change much for the better even if he sincerely tries, nor am I under any illusions that there can be any salvation or renaissance for this long dead republic. But if a Trump victory inspires the ‚Äúleft‚Äù to unrest that snowballs into the civil war that finally ends the evil empire, so much the better. And that‚Äôs a real possibility. You know the right isn‚Äôt ever going to start it.

        The only thing that matters is preserving the American Nation (the American people). This includes not just our people as a majority but also our local territories. This means a total halt to immigration and mass peaceful deportation as well as whatever-is-required cartel uprooting and banishment.
Clearly Trump is the only hope for that. Even if he wins, it isn‚Äôt a guarantee. Do Americans have the will? Does Trump and his new friends have the will? Do they even have the desire?

            That is all a pipe dream. If they even allow Trump, he will deport no one. Violent negros will get more platinum plans and juice will get even more preferences and protections. Meanwhile, working class Whites will get squeezed further and life will get harder.

        I posted this here last week, but posting again for those that didn‚Äôt see it.  Might post again later in the week too:It‚Äôs my impression that some people here don‚Äôt intend to vote, either on the perception that it‚Äôs a waste of time because it makes no difference (policy never changes no matter who is in office, they‚Äôll rig it anyway with fake votes), or because it actively harms by giving legitimacy to and participating in the GAE.But I do invite anyone reading this to vote, especially if you are registered (or can still register) in a battleground state.1. Obviously 2017-2021 didn‚Äôt ‚Äúmake America great again‚Äù, but it did slow down the constant hate-driven anti-normal-people warfare of the Obama and Biden regimes2. There are ways a Trump presidency will make a tangible difference. One example: if Cackles wins, the nightmare will continue and perhaps worsen for the Jan 6th prisoners (as well as the zersetzung of so many others like Guliani, Eastman, etc). If Trump wins, the Jan 6ers will probably be released.¬†Those literally tortured good people deserve that.3. Even if the Leviathan is gonna Leviathan no matter who is gets elected, most people on all sides interpret a vote for Trump as a middle finger to the Beast4. It‚Äôs a two or three hours if you have long lines, but for me and probably many others, it‚Äôs like half an hour. You could easily spend more time dealing with a clogged sink on a given day.To me, consistently each election voting for the candidate available who is closest to ‚Äúbased‚Äù/the populist right is like putting a tool away after using it rather than leaving it out on the counter, or taking a break during the work day to walk around the block instead of play a game on one‚Äôs phone. By itself, it‚Äôs not going to change much, but living a good life consists of many small actions like that. We can all wait for an American Pinochet suddenly arriving and in one grand swoop setting everything straight. But, meanwhile, what are the actions, however small, that we can take in the war.The regime has been hemorrhaging legitimacy for years now, and I suspect that they would probably rather let Trump win the election (and turn to other efforts) than resort to obvious rigging.Also, for people in non-swing states ‚Äì many libs make a big deal out of the total national popular vote, and there‚Äôs armies of just-nationalized peasants in big cities who can‚Äôt speak English and are on public assistance to run up their numbers. You could help counterbalance that.

            I would say Point 1 is incorrect. The first Trump term did not slow down the insanity, it inspired the ‚Äúleft‚Äù to increase it. In fact, the 2016 result was the thing that really mentally broke them and sent them over the edge. This suggests a ‚Äúlie down and take it, they‚Äôll be harder on you if you fight‚Äù mentality, but they‚Äôre so deranged now that it doesn‚Äôt really matter anymore whether or not you ‚Äúfight,‚Äù they will be vindictive either way.

                In 2021-2024, the Federal Dem regime has taken huge steps towards destroying the country ‚Äì1. importing who knows how millions criminals and other peasants and spreading them around swing states, extra-white states, and sparsely populated red states2. use the FBI, DOJ, and other mechanisms to jail and otherwise destroy right wing public figures and activists3. spending trillions we don‚Äôt have and triggering a massive spike in inflation4. spending money on DEI bs instead for say infrastructure5. dooming the US economy by forcing the rest of the world out of the dollar-based world economy with stupid sanctions on Russia because Bill Browder and Larry Fink want to make money off of the resources of the Ukraine (and Russia itself).A Hilary 2017-2021 regime probably would have done many of the same things, except four years earlier.1 and 2 would not have happed if Trump had been allowed to win in 2020, 3 less so, 4 less so, and 5 probably not.

            Yep. Mitch McConnell announced recently that he expected the GOP Senate would spend more time fighting Trump than Democrats. That told me that McConnell thinks there is at least a possibility Trump would be allowed back into office, so it is necessary to pre-announce his opposition to anything someone ostensibly in his own party may propose.

        I think the biggest procedural issue is whether you assume the fraud (which is a given at this point) is bottom-up or top-down. 2020 was bottom-up. It was an emergent phenomenon ‚Äî various poll workers Did What They Had To ‚Ñ¢ in order to Save Our Democracy ‚Ñ¢; had the shenanigans taken place somewhere like Venezuela, even the Left would‚Äôve laughed at how transparent it was. My contention has always been that it‚Äôs psychologically impossible for the Left to go all-in on top-down Fortification ‚Äî ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt rig elections,‚Äù the emotional logic runs, ‚Äúbecause that‚Äôs what BAD people do.‚Äù The most they‚Äôll ever do top-down is what I think they‚Äôll do after December, or whenever Al Franken‚Äôs car shows up with enough Harris ballots in the trunk to install her: Australia-style mandatory voting. That way, the people who Do What They Have To Do ‚Ñ¢ will only need to tweak the algorithms a bit ‚Äî the counts will be over by 11pm on Election Night, and it was a squeaker, but hey, whaddaya know, the Democrat won.

            Why can‚Äôt it be both? It‚Äôs not a coincidence that the needed to win districts in the swing states went their way, usually after a break and reset in counting. That indicates top down. But make no mistake, you know that many a local Shaniqwa, Lupe and Becky took it upon themselves to ensure lots of ballots were fortified for democracy. This go around the question will be how much top down will be used, but I don‚Äôt have any doubt there will still be a metric ton of bottom up from the left because after all, they are battling literal moustache man.

            I think it was a blend of both in 2020. Ballot harvesting in PA, for example, is a top down institution at this point. It has been going since before Trump arrived in 2016. It energized and augmented in 2020 by the groundswell of ‚ÄúBy Any Means Necessary‚Äù activism. In a place like Georgia it was mostly bottom up, helped by official incompetence.Institutional vote rigging is a double edge sword. In Mass, when Kennedy died, they had a special election to fill the seat. Scott Brown, a Republican, won a close race with 52% of the vote. In 2012 he lost to a Fake Indian, despite getting more votes than in 2010. The reason is the party machines in Boston, Worcester, Springfield and Lowell did not come out in 2010. They were run by mayors who hated the 2010 Democrat nominee.

                In the before times, people like the AP ran stories like this:ALICE, Texas (AP) ‚Äî In 1977, Associated Press reporter James W. Mangan‚Äôs exclusive interview with a South Texas election judge who detailed certifying false votes for Lyndon B. Johnson nearly three decades earlier made headlines across the country.With the win by an 87-vote margin in the 1948 Democratic primary runoff, Johnson, then a congressman, easily defeated his Republican opponent to take a seat in the U.S. Senate, and he eventually ascended to the presidency.Mangan spent three years pursuing the story, which pulled back the curtain on the victory that had drawn suspicions ever since election officials in rural Jim Wells County announced the discovery of uncounted votes in ballot box known as Box 13.Headlines across the U.S. that accompanied the story included: ‚ÄúPolling Official: Phony Votes Stole ‚Äô48 Runoff for LBJ‚Äù; ‚ÄúLBJ‚Äôs election to Senate ‚Äòstolen‚Äô‚Äù; ‚ÄúTexan Claims Fix in LBJ Election.‚Äùhttps://apnews.com/article/lbj-stolen-election-box-13-mangan-c818e478ec509c65585d3094bda69f96In the after (2020) times, even a whiff of a mention that elections could be ‚Äòstolen‚Äô would put one in the crosshairs of giant multinational corporations from social media on down, have one disbarred, prosecuted‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. out driving in ‚Äòthe country‚Äô yesterday and saw a vomit-inducing giant banner at the local demo-rat, sold-out small burg campaign HQ ‚Äî ‚ÄúHarris-Walz We‚Äôre Never Going Back‚Äù ‚Äî with the usual smatter of their signs that happen to also indicate another cash-strapped hamlet near a blue shitlib capitol ‚Äî was ‚Äògentrified‚Äô by the L Gee Bee Q crowd.Looks like they would be okay with ‚Äògoing back‚Äô to stolen elections.

                TPTB in 2020 were worried about the amount of outrage it had generated, and decided to put its thumb on the scales. After all, Normie Boomercon isn‚Äôt going to riot let alone secede, but leftists are so emotive they can‚Äôt be trusted not to force a brutal crackdown. I initially discounted that fraud had occurred at the scale it did, but when the motive for widespread cheating became apparent it made perfect sense. This time around, it doesn‚Äôt seem like TPTB care all that much, largely because there just isn‚Äôt as much passion involved. Of course, that doesn‚Äôt preclude emergent behavior from the bottom up, which is probable. The question is whether it will be determinative.

                    I meant boomer as a mindset, not a specific age group. Boomers, as such, had no direct role in the 1965 Immigration Act. The voters are nowadays largely ignored in any event. Trump at least talks about their concerns.

                Quite right. The entire history of the New Left‚Äìand not just in electoral politics‚Äìis of a completely amoral, the-end-justifies-the-means approach.

            Lancaster is a Republican county. We saw similar efforts in Arizona during the 2020 election. It‚Äôs the honest election officials who are going to jail there. Arizona missed its chance to clean up their elections when they still had a Republican governor and legislature. Instead, they allowed themselves to be goaded into opening them up to fraud. In power Republicans focus on passing tax cuts, accommodating alien migrants, appointing non-white officeholders, and demonstrating how anti-racist they are. Then, when they inevitably find themselves out of office and under indictment, try to raise more money from their dazed supporters in order to try and recover the situation.

        Trump very well may be allowed to win, and it does not matter in the long term. Still there are good signs from the electorate, such as:Voters have blown off the warnings of incipient fascism. It may not be too long until they think the actual thing might not be so bad since the current form of totalitarianism does not work to their benefit. The important part is official propaganda is dismissed.Disgust with the system is widespread and deep.People largely tune out the noise‚ÄìI think most actually don‚Äôt give a hot damn about the election outside of punishment one way or another.As Citizen points out above, this election or perhaps the next time will be the last election in which the GOP will be nationally competitive. That may be liberating. White people will be forced soon enough to decide how invested they are in the system, and if not very much, how to opt out of it. People are voting with their feet even now, and that only will increase after November 6 regardless of who wins or ‚Äúwins.‚Äù The whites in the nomenklatura will be ousted soon enough (this explains some of the rogue elite), and they will become part of the unclean despite their best efforts. This is the final curtain for even the zombie version of the United States.

            That has been on my mind too, that we are finally seeing some cracks in the WW2 mythology, the Hitler booga booga no longer carrying the weight it once did. Perhaps due to overuse.

        ACT BLUE money laundering.Something like $80 million went into Kamala‚Äôs reelection campaign virtually overnight when she announced.There were then stories about how Act Blue was using FEC donor lists to launder cash via small donors.I checked my own info:  to my incredible surprise, Act Blue piggybacked on my information to make a $.25 donation and another $25 donation back in 2019.  (I‚Äôd donated to Trump when I was ticked about the impeachment crap)Catching and jailing those responsible should be TRIVIALLY EASY.  It‚Äôs just comparing databases.  There‚Äôs probably billions that have been masked by this.Check out the link.  You might be surprised.https://checkmydonation.org/

        1) voting is pointless; it‚Äôs still rigged and fake and gay.2) i hope trump wins so as to hopefully ease cost of living and avoid WWIII nukes flying; and put RFK in power3) there will probably be terrible media and police sanctioned BLM/Antifa rioting again4) Trump will again be stymied by the cathedral at every turn; they may engineer an economic collapse to make him the fall guy5) Trump cannot and will not save America.

        I agree with those who say voting doesn‚Äôt solve our problems long-term, and also agree that the rigging will only get worse and might make voting moot.That said, I suspect there might be an upper fraud limit, and also that Trump in office could buy us some more time to prepare for the worst.  Going out to vote for the Orange Man won‚Äôt cost me much time, and I‚Äôll get to see whether as many degenerates show up at the polls as when weed was on the ballot here.  Could be interesting.  So, at the risk of legitimizing the immoral system, I‚Äôll participate one last time.I need all the prep time I can get before stuff breaks loose, if only to maximize my comfort in exile (whether internal or external).  If we buy more time, then perhaps more good folks will manage to bug out, and/or form alternate communities.  That has some value in my opinion.

        The destruction of public trust is intentional. Get everyone to hate everyone else and you get visceral anger begetting violence and mayhem. Then spin a media campaign that the plebs demand a return to order; and voila, in march the mercenary jackboots to save the day for a covert techno-tyranny. Next, ruthlessly crush dissent and lockdown the sheeple with a CBDC. That is our future unless we fight back. And not against each other, but focused on the root of the problem. Lamppost time.

        The owner of the LAT is Patrick Soon-Shiong. Born and raised in South Africa, he makes his billions off of Abraxane, used to treat breast, lung, and pancreatic cancer. So the man has certainly done some very good things.His daughter, Nika, is the one who axed the endorsement of Harris. She is very angry at Harris over the lack of action to punish Israel over Gaza and the Palestinians.Now, despite being born in South Africa, no one would confuse either her father or herself as anything but Han Chinese. Why does a Han Chinese woman whose father is a billionaire get angry over Gaza? The same reason the Filipino daughter of a Philippines TV billionaire gets angry over Gaza at UPenn and leads the student protests over it.Status. White dudes have been chased away from power and status in LA since Mayor Yorty left. Sine the 1960s. Rather it has been the Saturday people that these daughters of powerful Asian billionaires resent. And that realignment has been happening with astonishing speed. The coalition of the Ascendant: Alphabet plus people, billionaire asians, blacks, muslims etc. have decided to vote Saturday people off the island. Who in turn have boarded the Trump liferaft. Example: Hollywood went from being run by Saturday people to being run by black and alphabet people in about the past six years.Steven Speilberg can‚Äôt do his Blackhawks movie or a Star Wars movie, Leslye Headland, Weinstein‚Äôs former personal assistant, gets a Star Wars series.[Related: the NYT has prep articles demanding Biden invoke martial law, refuse to certify Trump if he wins, and do a Fujimori self-coup.]

            Putin is a much more consequential political figure of this century than Trump.  I wouldn‚Äôt even consider them in the same league. Putin brought his country back from a humiliating defeat/collapse and economic malaise to become a world superpower again in around 20 years.  Other than intangible items like ‚Äòwaking up the normies‚Äô or bringing attention to the Deep State, what has Trump actually done?  Genuine question, how could you even compare the two?

        I‚Äôm fully convinced Trump is winning, but for reasons somewhat outside yours.There are forces in action that are inevitably leading to bad ends. This is regardless of who is in office. First and foremost, Russia is going to win favorable terms in the Ukraine conflict in the next two years (tops). This is unavoidable. The west is going to find the terms repugnant because it will be all of the demands the Russians have stated clearly over and over. With trump in office, the news will bleat over and over how Trump bent over for the Russians because he loves Putin. Russiagate 2.0, the reboot. There will be a recession (we‚Äôre likely already in one), Trump certainly isn‚Äôt going to cut back the deficit much, so that national debt and international dedollarization is going to continue. If a pile of foreseen disasters land in the trump presidency, they can kill populism once and for all, and pave the way for Newsome or Whitmer.

            Agreed. Z likes to draw parallels with the Russian revolution and the French Revolution, and there are certainly similarities. I think it‚Äôs going to be something more akin to a mix of the Spanish Civil War/Irish War of Independence. Currently reading a great old book on the Spanish Civil War. It‚Äôs a topic Americans know precious little about, and the little we think we know often comes from the perspective of the communists that fought. A fascinating aspect about the Spanish civil war was how the liberal republicans almost entirely joined the communists and anarchists against the church and traditionalist forces. An aspect we see all over the west today.

        I am only barely interested enough in this upcoming election to read Zman‚Äôs commentary on it. In terms of policy, it is irrelevant who wins. The country and the culture will continue spiraling in the same perilous direction regardless of who the Puppet-in-Chief is. The main effect of a Trump victory will be to fool people into believing we‚Äôve miraculously reversed course. Our momentum will nevertheless remain unchanged. If anything, should Trump prevail, it might actually hasten that momentum by breathing more life into the progressive animus that plays such an important role in our trajectory.No man on a white horse will be riding in to save you.

            I bet I win the most downvotes today. Even so-called dissidents can‚Äôt help but fall for the ‚Äúvote harder‚Äù ruse. It seems that a mere handful of us have advanced to the other side of the farce known as electoral politics ‚Äî the side where we reject the dog-and-pony show outright, if for no other reason than to avoid being played for a sap. More of you should come join the admittedly tiny few of us on this side. I promise you it‚Äôs not nearly as cold and frightening a place as you appear to presume.

                I‚Äôm totally there, and I agree you will get lots of downvotes ‚Äì but if you‚Äôre like me, you won‚Äôt care.  What counts is acknowledging reality, not upvotes from people high on hopium.  ‚ÄúIf we just get the right people in office . . . ‚Äù  ‚ÄúTrump will clean house . . . ‚Äù  etc.  Demographics are destiny.  Mestizos are not White.  Indians (like Usha Vance) are not pro-White American patriots.  AINO is about 53% White.  But go ahead and knock yourselves out folks, and vote harder yet again.

            WK,You can hold all you positions and still vote in each electoral cycle.The delusion is thinking that it is an either or problem instead of a both and problem.
Yes, there is no savior coming. Yes, local affairs and local organization are your most important efforts. It still doesn‚Äôt mean that opting out of the National Political Show is the smart thing to do. It is literally the least you can do ‚Äì casting a ballot.

                Even if the election mattered (which it doesn‚Äôt) . . . the odds of my one vote affecting the outcome of a presidential election are probably roughly the same as me winning the lottery. I don‚Äôt play the lottery. And I don‚Äôt vote. I know the odds.
Voting is mainly about the ego of the voter. It‚Äôs about little people who don‚Äôt matter much getting to believe for a moment that they are consequential. They are not. The technocrats who dominate the system will do what they want independent of any suggestions from the peanut gallery.

                I salute you, 3g4me. By and large, most folks who are interested enough in these topics to read about them will feel a need to continue investing in the, as you rightly dub it, ‚Äúhopium‚Äù of voting. I try not to condescend to such believers. Their faith in the system against everything else that they know is a bit innocent and charming to be honest. However, it‚Äôs hard not to sneer at Charlie Brown after the millionth or so time he‚Äôs missed that football Lucy was holding for him.

                    My view is just that ‚Äì Charlie Brown and the football.  After months of ZMan posts and thousands of comments about how corrupt the polls are how corrupt the media is, how debased the voting registration system is, etc., people still just cannot break those bonds instilled andreinforced throughout their lives:  That their vote matters, and that we live in a ‚Äòdemocracy‚Äô where Joe.

                    For many of us who are considering voting, faith in the system or belief in Trump has nothing to do with it. Our rationale is far baser. On the off chance that the vote isn‚Äôt subverted profoundly enough to fortify Our Democracy, and Trump therefore does return to the Anti-White House, our enemies will be in mortal agony. I know this. I have family members who will be in dire jeopardy of miocardial infarction if Trump wins. This alone may be ample justification for going to the well one more time. Then again, maybe not. I remain squarely on the fence. At any rate, not everybody on our side who votes is a credulous sap.

                        Ostei:Your comment runs parallel to my view that Trump is a middle finger for both his most passionate supporters and his fiercest haters. His haters think that the middle finger is pointed at them which is egotistical, as most such people don‚Äôt register on Trump‚Äôs radar.Now I will admit to having been guilty of road rage a few times in my past. When I was much younger and more cavalier, I even flipped the bird to other drivers maybe three or four times. There was a brief satisfaction in such action. The vindication was nevertheless short-lived. And my infrequently extended middle finger did nothing to improve the general state of driving.I have no objection to you voting purely out of spite. I just don‚Äôt see much utility in it myself. But have at it if that is your wont.

        The changes to our voting system have made fraud easier than ever and harder than ever to prove. Plausible deniability is built into the system, as in 2020. It is the joker in this year‚Äôs presidential race.

        One little bit of interest lately is the performance of Trump‚Äôs media company stock,DJT over the past month or so.  It‚Äôs nearly quadrupled and might portend a YUGE victory.  Now what might be accomplished afterwards is the big question ‚Äì probably not a hell of a lot, but. From my perspective, it at least would represent a big FU to all the libs***s in my and others lives.  That‚Äôs worth a little something‚Ä¶

        ‚Äú‚Ä¶as the base condition is assumed to be corrupt. We may never trust our elections again due to the 2020 shenanigans.‚ÄùIn general, a good commentary.  However, I must maintain from a measurement standpoint, you can‚Äôt ‚Äúadjust‚Äù for shenanigans.  ‚ÄúShenanigans‚Äù is basically noise, or error and as such unknown and therefore not ‚Äúadjustable‚Äù.  All you can do is expand your confidence intervals wrt electoral prediction‚Äîmargin of error so to speak.Since the electoral effect of shenanigans is pretty much impossible to ferret out (and therefore measure) due to today‚Äôs judicial system indifference we must turn to other means to insure popular will prevails in the ‚Äúfranchise‚Äù.  This means restructuring/improving the process, rather than challenging the corrupted results.The current means Rep‚Äôs are using to circumvent‚Äîreally overcome‚Äîcheating by the Dem‚Äôs is to attempt to swamp the Dem‚Äôs with votes at the polls, using increased registration, early voting, and such.  They‚Äôve in essence bought into (accepted) the current corrupt process and use campaign tag lines such as, ‚Äúbeat the cheat‚Äù and ‚Äútoo big to rig‚Äù!  Unbelievable, and short sighted.  As Z-man has noted, the corrupt election process will adjust to produce the *new* number of fraudulent votes needed‚Äîwhich is far easier than to produce new legitimate votes needed‚Äîto win an election.Now, none of the above‚ÄîI admit‚Äîis likely, but is the only way to *fix* the current corrupt process.  A ‚Äúwin‚Äù for the Rep‚Äôs in 2024 just buys time before the inevitable permanent decline into completely fraudulent elections into the foreseeable future.At this point I usually say, ‚ÄúBrazil here we come‚Äù, however that‚Äôs unfair to Brazil as their ballot process is less susceptible to shenanigans than ours in many ways‚Ä¶.

        it [the 2020 election] was an election that featured many never-before-seen anomalies. For example, Arizona, another swing state, saw a 38% increase in voter turnout.
I wasn‚Äôt surprised by that at all; I expected it going in. I‚Äôm convinced that in 2016 there were thousands of Clinton supporters (or perhaps merely Trump haters) who didn‚Äôt take the trouble to vote because they were sure Clinton had it in the bag. Four years later, they were saying ‚ÄúIf that !@#$% wins again, it‚Äôs not going to be becauseIdidn‚Äôt vote!‚Äù.

        Two possibilities‚Äîaside from the obvious, the TV simply lying about the result. (The courts have held thatmedia callsare final election results, criminal to dispute.)One: Trump has been sufficiently neutered that he‚Äôs allowed to be seen winning the vote, though not by the amount hereallywins it, which istoo hot for TV. The fraud is to conceal a landslide, not to defeat it. There are signs of this, of Trump having been made acceptable (with a bullet), widely noted by both sides (black- and white-pilled). Righties who keep one foot in nerdy respectability will credit their clever-boybut actuallys, like Whitmer and Shapiro not having their hearts in the steal, etc. They are wrong.The question then is how soon they kill Trump after the election, toget on with‚ÄúTrumpism without Trump‚Äù and Make America Indian Again. I say Christmas. There‚Äôs no betting market that will let me wager on this. Libertarianism refuted.Second scenario: This time, rather than pissing around again with pretending there was an election and the capital is under siege and staging weird horror-movie night rallies to install their favored Democrat, the military simply rolls on Mar-a-Lago, and shortly thereafter on the rest of us.
