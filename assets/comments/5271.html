        Bingo, Dutch! So many just don’t get it.  [Sigh…]  Friends – but especially ALL but one close family member – are experiencing just this, “myotahapea,” [missing Zman’s fancy punctuation thingies (thingys?)] as they watch me cheer for, promote, stand up with, and yearn for MORE TRUMP!!!Thank you, Roy L., for the fast definition as I was waiting for our warp-speed-challenged Gore-created interweb to locate one… [Not only were we promised “transformation,” “Electricity rates” that would “necessarily skyrocket,” but didn’t we also get as part of this butt-kissing (butt-kicking… same same with the elite we group -cough cough- elect every couple or four years or so) that “net neutrality” would allow everyone the same $hitty internet/cable service?!?]

        In short, If Trump is really the big “F-you” and the middle finger to the powers that be, why do TPTB give him so many opportunities, in so many contexts, to give them the finger?  They really don’t get it.
I do not know how all this will play out, but I enjoy seeing the “right people” squirm.  Fox News has been unmasked as a member of the club.  That is not a surprise, but it has been fun to watch them lose their cover in such an awkward fashion.

            Ratings, baby!  Ratings.
Every time Trump flips a media figure the bird, they get umpteen zillion views and clicks.  The country is even angrier at the media — most definitely including Fox — than they are at The Establishment.  But the media doesn’t see that; all they see is their numbers going up.
[That’s an excuse of sorts, I suppose, for why they don’t see what’s happening.  I have no excuse at all for the GOP.  I mean, I know they’re the stupid party, but this is too-stupid-to-remember-to-breathe territory].

        The Republican leadership is ideologically liberal and out of step with the base.  Trump is merely the messenger the Republican base has chosen. He is bringing a warning. Depending on how the messenger is treated, the base might well stay home in 2016, and the Democrats might will the Presidency and both Houses whomever they nominate. We might actually be witnessing the demise of the Republican Party.

        Yeah, I had to look it up. Geez, Zman don’t let this poet thing go to your head.I read Nat Review every day. They are very upset about the trump business…its like watching people get the rug pulled out from under their feet.I don’t much like the trump. Blowhard a……. Is the phrase that comes to mind. But he sure has struck a goldmine in the dirt pile the gop pretended didn’t exist. I was a Scott walker supporter, but he’s become absolutely flummoxed on how to bridge the gap between the big republican donors, and the angry crowd of peasants. Myself, it’s hard to just pretend it’s a joke as you watch 200 plus years of constitutional history swirl around the drain.We didn’t even come close to Romans in longevity did we?Tim

        After the weekend political shows, I don’t know if I’m more sick of seeing Jeb or Christie. I do know that I won’t vote for either one. I do notice that I pay more attention to the buying of politicians than I did pre-Trump. Did you know that Tom Steyer is buying up Latino politicians? I suspect they will be the brown verison of Sharpton and Jackson. And they will deliver about as much to their constituents.

        Trump’s reply should be, “bring it”. The GOP Establishment is just not getting this. It might be a squeaker, but Trump could pull out a third party win if they try to deny him the nomination. Look at all the polls. Who would vote for Jeb? About 7% of the queried populous. He’s going nowhere and I’m already tired of seeing his earnest but-it’s-my-turn-to-be-president face.
