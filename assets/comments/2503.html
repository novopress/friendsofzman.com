        “They would burn down every church in the country and ban the religion entirely.”
Certainly some of the Left would be in favor of that, though I think the more cunning ones would prefer to keep a neutered, Church-of-England-Lite around as another medium to manipulate the masses.  Something vaguely spiritual that pushes the Jesus-was-a-Socialist meme but doesn’t dwell much on absolutes or God.

        Most evangelicals I talk to still believe they can take over the Republican Party.  If they want political clout of some kind, leaving the Republicans and forming some kind of conservative third party is the only avenue.  They can then throw support to any candidate who walks the talk.  True conservatives would come forward this way and conservatives are still the largest segment, something like forty percent of the electorate.  I’d love to see politics become interesting again.

        Cdjaco, you are referring to most of the non-evangelical mainline churches in our country today, correct?  The ones who preach “something vaguely spiritual that pushes the Jesus-was-a-socialist meme but doesn’t dwell much on absolutes or God”. Yup, sounds about right. “Coexist”, dude!
