        That does not mean climate science has not accumulated a lot of useful data that allows for some preliminary conclusions, but this is not physics.
——————but what about theoretical physics? I suppose the problem with Climate science is that it’s being used to push a political agenda, whereas you don’t see that with physics.

            but what about theoretical physics? I suppose the problem with Climate science is that it’s being used to push a political agenda, whereas you don’t see that with physics.That’s one major problem facing climate science. Too many in the profession have tried to cash in by whoring themselves out to political interests. I think the other is they tried to have their debates in public. That’s allowed the media to drag in all sorts of entertaining wackos to pass themselves off as scientists.The good news is the tide seems to be turning a real scientists are getting control of the field again.
