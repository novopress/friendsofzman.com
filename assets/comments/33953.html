        Liberal democracy was always a cover for something unnamed lurking beneath the surface. Now we call it wokeness, but whatever it’s called, it’s based on envy, revenge, and the urge to subvert and destroy. It is deceitful except for the appalling occasions when it isn’t — when the mask comes off. The fact that liberal democracy seeks to hide this disgusting thing as it crawls to the surface, keep an eye on the real thing hiding underneath, not on what liberal democracy purports to represent.

            it’s based on envy
It is not a coincidence that at least four of the ten commandments deal in some form with envy — whether murder, theft, adultery, or coveting, they all involve wanting or taking something that doesn’t belong to you.

                It was (I think) Gary North, a Christian oriented economics and politics author of the 1980s, who wrote a book about the consequences of envy. A key takeaway I recall, and I’ve never heard stated exactly the same way elsewhere, was his opinion that unlike the other Seven Deadly Sins, envy was the only one that could not be placated.If you’re angry, you can attack, injure or kill.If you’re lustful, you can have sex.If you’re a glutton, you can eat.If you’re slothful, you can take a nap.If you’re proud, you can…I don’t know..feel superior to others maybe.If you’re greedy, you can gain more stuff, by means fair or foul.But if you’re envious, you really can’t do anything to lose that affliction. It’s not quite jealousy, because that implies that you could become an equal of who or what you’re jealous of, or perhaps steal his property. But if you envy, you implicitly acknowledge those are impossible. Even if you harm or destroy the object of your envy, your sense of inferiority remains.It’s sort of like being parched with thirst, and only having salt water to drink.

                    Superficially, greed is quite close to envy except that greed (and the other sins in the list) is mostly about externals while envy is concerned with essence. I’m greedy for more money. That’s an external thing. I can get money by working for it or stealing it. Problem solved. Envy is not about what things you lack but about lacking certain attributes in your essence.
This is why some kind of apartheid became absolutely necessary once Western man encountered the other races in a big way starting in about 1500. The alternative is endless war and strife.

            ‘It’s based on envy, revenge, and the urge to subvert and destroy’Can’t be repeated enough.  Woke is the weaponization, principally, of female spite and resentment of maleness and masculinity.  Instead of a complementary, traditional relationship with the masculine, the feminine instead resents the existence of the masculine and seeks — as you note — to subvert and destroy it.Secondarily, Woke stems from of-color resentment of the accomplishments of white males.  So women and of colors are the obvious choice by the ‘powers and principalities’ (Ephesians 6:12) for destruction of white male civilization, what’s called the patriarchy.  The part of the Civil Rights Revolution not paid for by government was financed by private elite instruments, e.g., the Rockefeller Fund.‘The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy’ (John 10:10)You do not reason the thief and the murderer outta your house, put it like that.

            I’m sure many have written about that thing lurking under the surface. I specialize in Nietzsche so I’ll share my understanding of his writings. The crucial flaw of Liberal Democracy, indeed dating back to (at least) the Enlightenment, is the basic ideal of egalitarianism. Turns out that equality is a rather tenuous goal, and that a hierarch, a rank order is usually what’s found in a society. And not just human ones.Closely allied with these ills of civilization is Nietzsche’s concept of a Slave (or Master) Morality. That’s a lesson for another time.Nightshade would be very much on board with TomA’s “envy” and “revenge” as goals of the slaves. Also about the sneaky aspect. I’m not so sure about the destruction part, although nihilism and the inversion of old values is a key concept in his writings too.Please don’t get me wrong; I am as much a “griller” who loves, at least in theory, the dreams of equal protection under the law, democracy and all that. But I’m old enough to recognize some structural flaws in that Neuschwannstein Castle that we so dreamily worship while we’re flipping our burgers in the backyard.Men are not equal, nor shall they become so.

        Apartheid in South Africa was necessary in order for Western Civilization to exist in that faraway outpost of European society. As a result of our feckless zeal in taking it down, that white society is in grave danger of disappearing entirely. However, the type of Apartheid that is now being formed in Europe (and Australia and NZ) is going to lead to the same destructive end that it has already led to in SA. By contrast, though, taking apartheid down in Europe will save Western Civilization…what’s left of it.

            Converting Europe to SA-style Apartheid wouldn’t be bad. SA Apartheid was, after all, a reaction to a massive flood of illegal immigrants that the native (Afrikaner) population failed to eject.
Ejection would be better.

                    No details are given about the Anthony family history. But life must be pretty good if the can live in a $900K home, albeit rental, in a gated community. More’s the pity that teen son apparently was in the habit of toting a knife to track meets and felt the need to defend his life by stabbing some random white boy to death.Perhaps he feared for his life from all those crackas at his school, I don’t know.The family has raised several hundred grand for his “defense” but somehow a brand new car (and pizzas) have been delivered…one would think their priorities might be a little bit different. Heard the term “optics”, guys?You can take the Negro out of the ghetto, but you can’t take the ghetto (or jungle?) out of the Negro.Karmelo will probably cop a plea to some form of second-degree murder and will only serve a few years. After all, he’s a minor and we must be easy on him.https://nypost.com/2025/04/16/us-news/karmelo-anthony-renting-900k-home-in-gated-community-with-family-bought-new-car-after-release-on-bond-in-austin-metcalf-murder-case-report/

                        He wasn’t carrying the knife to defend himself. He wasn’t squatting in the tent to find some shade. He was there to claim territory by intimidation first. When Metcalfe asserted his claim to what was his, the feral negro escalated the territorial dispute and established his claim by stabbing Metcalfe in the heart.The feral negro and his family are remorseless. The entirety of blacks in America are staking their claim to our territory by refusing to adhere to our moral laws and our legal system. This wasn’t a murder. This was self defense. It is very simple and obvious. That tent and anything that they claim is theirs is theirs and they will make the ultimate act to back it up – violence and killing.  They will then back it up, not by acquiescing to the white man’s system of laws and justice, but by brazenly denying its legitimacy and using one of their own on the inside of it, to subvert and destroy it.That is the reality of what is happening before our eyes. Ethnic Europeans need to heed the wake up call and see things for how they are. Perhaps they do, and they lack the courage to take the necessary actions to ensure their survival.

                            History, “his  story,” teaches cruel lessons regarding human achievement. Some groups develop, and others remain stagnant. The latter instantiate a sense of group entitlement to the achievements of the achievers. It’s envy combined with misappropriation. Crispus Attucks was the true George Washington and Robert Goddard was actually a black jew. Karmelo was clearly raised with this sense of entitlement, and these incidents will continue until and unless society rejects it.

                            The joggers arent the problem as they never have and never will defeat any organized force of europeans.  They would be cowed and pushed back to whatever reasonable limit in a week.
The problem is their protection by the small hat lawyers and activists that we allow to infest our system and turn it against us.  These people also destroy our own will to protect ourselves (see the dad in this case). The small hats are the primary real enemy, nons are just a weapon they frequently use.

                        I would suspect, albeit I know nothing of the case, that this Anthony guy is a textbook example of “regression to the mean” we’ve spoken about recently.His parents most likely have the exceptional ability to control their violent tendencies, and to that extent were able to maintain an upper middle class lifestyle.  Unfortunately their offspring’s (Anthony’s) DNS reverted to his African past—and he decided to knife a White guy who “dis’d” him.A violent response in excessive proportion to the non violent interaction presented by the deceased White victim.  However, all too commonly found in the Black ghetto’s of this country.  As they say, you can take a Black out of Africa, but you can’t remove the African from the Black.

                            Compsci:  Anthony is not an example ofregression to the mean – he lives in a single-parent home and his fambly moved to Frisco (initially a very White and still very Asian suburb) with subsidized housing.  His school is half south and east Asian.  Guarantee he is in remedial classes, like all the noggers who first came to the area after Katrina.  He was seen sitting under more than one school’s canopy, going through other students’ bags.  He’s a typical rabid POS nogger, who is supported vociferously by other noggers and financially by leftist whites.Living even in a supposedly ‘nice’ suburb does Whites no good (ask the Georgia family who had a nogger smash their window in Monday night saying he was going to kill them all).

                                I stand corrected.  Of course, we should have known better than to dump such folk into a benign environment as you’ve described.  Let a wolf into the henhouse, and you get a lot of dead chickens.Not to blame the victim, but I now wonder just if the White boy’s father ever gave his son “the talk”.I remember sending my daughter off to university waay back when.  The instructions were absolutely clear: Never, ever interact with Blacks—especially at “parties”.  Never attend any social function where you can see them in any number.  Never be alone anywhere with any of them on campus or off.  Especially avoid any scholarship athlete—White or Black.Not sure what she did or if she did.  She survived.  However, there *was* a graduation party held at our home for her group of friends from the honors society.  Yep, one was Black.  The most wimpy, 5 foot tall guy, with great big glasses like Steve Urkel from Family Matters.  Parents were working class from Chicago.  Dirt people like the rest of us and rightfully proud of their one son.   I let that one slide.  😉

                                    Compsci:  Good job warning your daughter unambiguously.  I understand letting the one ‘slide.’  Problem is, all of them have some boyfriend or cousin or half sibling’s girlfriend’s ex who is a standard nogger and a problem.  Better to avoid them all than to take the risk.

                                        That is correct.  In my case, these folk were invited by daughter.  Difficult to crash the party.  On the other hand, the “nose of the camel” is to be avoided.  But looking back on it, we have photos, this was the craziest bunch of “nerds” you ever did see.  These people, one and all, were what we’d term “losers” in life’s social lottery.  I remember thinking just how stereotypical the whole affair was.  You could have set up a movies camera and produced a comedy show.  😉

                                    No – the original place his fambly was living in (at the time he murdered Austin Metcalf) was subsidized – could have been Sec 8, or some state or county deal.  The $900 k home is being rented for $3500 a month, paid for by donations.  And that is the fault of GiveSendGo, which I will never use again.

                This.  The northern border of 1960’s South Africa was too long, and the terrain too varied, to protect the young, thriving Republic from the inevitable invasion.
“Apartheid” was just the global Left’s derogatory term for the multiracial Republic’s effort to mediate the crime resulting from the millions flocking to SA’s wealthy, techologically’advanced Urban centers.  Nelson Mandela was a terrorist and the first “community organizer,” and his virtuous legacy is a complete farce.

                Because once the Roths types use the British army to seize the gold and diamond mines, they didn’t want to pay Afrikaaner workers a decent wage for pulling raw wealth out of the ground.

            In the long run, racial apartheid is necessary for what we have known as western civilization to exist anywhere. South Africa is just a case study, microcosm of how that works on a smaller scale, but the same forces operate on larger scales/stages, and longer timelines that are somewhat relative to the larger scales.

            Apartheid created an extremely sophisticated and advanced civilization in South Africa, with doctors like Christian Barnard creating the first heart transplants…But the liberals, mostly jews, communists, and women, managed to undermine it with their support for ANC violence…Now it is sinking into oblivion, with the rich people all having paramilitary protection, and the rest of the whites facing extinction…

                I think the attacks on Western civilization is not specific to simply “Western Civilization”.  Of course it’s a great example.  However, if we look anywhere that races and culture intermix—especially when one is demonstrable superior to the other, we see agitation, conflict, and outright violence.  Be it the Hutu’s vs the Tutsi’s, or White’s vs Blacks here.  The mixing of the races and cultures is problematic at best.

            Lately I’m come to the conclusion that Brits, and possibly Western/Northern Euros in general, have reached a point where they have been so peaceful and comfortable for so long, they have become effete, masochist, and cowardly. Surprising that it took so quickly, given the destruction of Europe a mere 100 years ago. I wonder if white people have something in them that grabs hold of ideology and takes it to the max. They seem to have no brake, at least most of them. Certainly not so-called Conservatives. When something starts rolling in white people, it takes a world war to stop it. We are possibly seeing that with Liberalism.Luckily, white Americans seem to check ideology better than most white people. Why? I don’t know exactly. We certainly have our Yankee moralists, but they aren’t a majority, and Americans don’t readily follow despots. (That is why there is so much Trump hate – they think he’s a despot.)

I’m no tough kid from the Gorbals, but they make me look like Studs Lonegan. The only difference in the US is there is stlll a hardy remnant of kick ass folk who won’t go down without a fight.

                “Luckily, white Americans seem to check ideology better than most white people. Why? I don’t know exactly.”The American Dream. Americans (those worthy of the name, anyway) ask themselves, “If I work my ass off, can I give my kids a better start than I got?” then don’t make excuses. They just go out and make it so. The bottom line is always staring you in the face. If it’s not improving the bottom line, toss it. Since most of what we call ideologies don’t improve the bottom line, we consider them luxuries, at best.The less ambitious, or those who “sell out” to get the inside track can indulge themselves with ideologies that don’t work. The rest don’t have time for it.

                I don’t think it’s cowardice.  I think it’s an increasingly thinning patience over the frustration and desire to make it work.  We were told we were all going to hold hands, sing kumbaya and march into the future.  We tried, we really did.
Instead we’re being parasited upon, bullied and slow-genocided, and our bankster controlled government is complicit.  Still, not to worry lads, the Saxon WILL begin to hate.

                        I’m the most unlikely person to have changed.  But I did.  In my late 40’s even.  The evidence just didn’t add up.  In retrospect I’m lucky I had a niggling feeling (if that’s the phrase) that something wasn’t right.  So I never fully relaxed.  But yes.  People can change.  Our people can change.  And once the preference cascade happens the change will be overwhelming.

                    If correct, this is evidence of an extreme naiveté and gullibility in our people, which needs to be addressed at some point.  I hope you’re right though – as embarrassing as the gullibility is, it’s much better than cowardice.

        There is a lot of literature and movies that imagine the UK as an authoritarian or Orwellian state with a gloomy and supine people. For most of my life I thought that this content was created for English speakers as a window into what we are most certainly not – but it was also a warning of what we could be.Now I hate to realize that this was in fact a warning: there was always a streak of timidity to the Brits, and of going along with whatever shit was dealt to them. “A quiet desperation is the English way”. This was always there to be exploited by tyrants. Good thing Americans got the hell out of there centuries ago.

                    SomeBoomer brains may think that way, but I as a “flagship” Boomer (born 1946) most certainly do not and never have. Then again, I left the company of my US contemporaries a long time ago to live contentedly in Franco’s Spain. Now I live in South America where the Boomer brain is focused on other things.

            The UK is/was a highly stratified society. As long as it was completely white, that worked out extraordinarily well. Once there was enough diversity to exploit, not so much. And to be clear on this point, the United States is infinitely worse demographically than the UK, but it does have more of a history of dissidence, no matter how faint that has become. The worst possible world, though, is a stratified society that uses a minority to oppress the majority.

            Yes, the timidity thing seems to be a feature, as seen in the refusal of the British Royal family to quite literally save their Russian relatives in 1917, letting them get slaughtered in a basement by the Bolsheviks, saying “tut-tut” as the world gasped. Actually, what King George V did not want to highlight was the fact that all these relatives, himself included, had mostly German blood, sort of like 250 years ago when another British monarch named George III, also of that lineage, sent English soldiers to the colonies to put down their American cousins in the Revolution. BTW the Battles of Lexington and Concord are to be commemorated this coming weekend! Raise a glass in toast!In 1917 there was a World War taking place, and Germany was the enemy; the British royal family even changed their name from Battenburg to Mountbatten, and became the House of Windsor, dontcha know. I remember when Diana Spencer was “affianced” to Prince Charles in the early 80s, many commentators pointed out that she had more English blood than he did. She also was related to Winston Churchill, and he of course had an American mother!

        “Almost forgotten now is Tommy Robinson, a street activist who opposes the importation of Muslims and other immigrants.”
Tommy opposes Muslim immigration period. He glories in non-Muslim immigration from India, Nigeria, or wherever. Also, he really, really loves Jews. The latter return his affections by having him arrested when he tries to attend their rallies in solidarity.

                He’s a working class bloke who came by his activism honestly when he saw his hometown, Luton, taken over by Pakistani Muslims. He tried to deflect the relentless attacks against him by defining this as a strictly religious issue. Thus, his love of non-Muslims and Jews. Apart from two very Semitic looking fellows who fly in from Tel Aviv and Perth, Australia to help lead his public rallies, this attempt at universalism has availed him nothing.

            Tommy is open about supporting Indian immigration.  As for Muslims, correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe what he wants is assimilation for Muslims, not deportation.He has also been accused of getting himself arrested in order to drive a fund-raising campaign. Not sure if that’s true though.

                The man’s risked nothing, this is his livelihood. He was at a luxury resort in Cyprus during last year’s upheavals. I’ve faced down reds with road flares and acrylic shields, had photographs of me, my vehicle and plate circulated on their message boards, been handcuffed and had home visits from the pigs over pamphlets and flyers, the works, andI would feed “Tommy Robinson” his teeth without a second thought.

                His imprisonment might be the most immoral of all, considering how many other Britons are doing far longer for less. An acquaintance of mine was sentenced to 18 years for possession of meme edits of Christchurch footage and some odds and ends nobody would bat an eye at stateside, later increased to 23. Meanwhile he’s given fines andserial short stints, sometimes for things that are actual crimes in any context, in between stretches of globetrotting Zionist agitation. Ever wonder why that is?

                    A quick question to ChatGPT shows that 23 years is a bit longer than the average sentence for *murder* in the UK in 2024.  That’s got to tell you something about priorities.  Verbal violence is held in higher distain than physical violence.  Of course, I suspect—as noted—this refers only to one particular race.

        White native Brits have known their days are numbered for decades. Regardless of who’s in office or which party is running things, it’s been decades of failed economic polices, massive deindustrialization, massive immigration and now with an open 2-teir police enforcement.Many Brits and Irish I’ve spoken to about their situation are leaving if they can and heading for small towns in Italy, Spain or France and encouraging their children to leave and find work in Australia, Canada, Asia or the US. Anyone with decent skills seems to have a fair chance with thousands having already left with no intentions of returning.Unfortunately, the days of countries needing well educated English speaking engineers, technicians, doctors, etc., are long gone. Asia has done a great job of educating the training their people in the US or the UK and returning home so whites need not apply in places like Hong Kong or Singapore or Malaysia.The idea that the UK is 6th in GDP is nonsense. London might be, but the rest of the UK is declining and faster than you can say UKIP.

                Talk, hell. The State of South Australia, for example, opened what was originally represented as Covid quarantine camps early into the tyranny. People who refused the vaccination were sent there. To be fair, even now Britain isn’t nearly as bad as Australia. And this is not new at all.
*eta: It isde factoillegal in Australia now even to mention there were concentration camps.

        The way the UK has formalized anarcho-tyranny and firmly established the natives as second-class citizens in their own country is… new. I mean, even when Soros DAs were doing it in our cities, they didn’t say so explicitly the way that the entire UK governing institution is doing right now. On top of that, the natives now officially have no recourse through legitimate means. The bureaucracy certainly doesn’t care, but if they vote in a way the elites don’t like, they will just invalidate the election and throw the representative in jail.

            The overt, parading masonry of the British royal and noble classes is unusual, providing built-in hegemony and organization.  If one wants to install a tyrannical system like Woke, all that’s left is to appoint co-opted state functionaries.
Thus Theresa May, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Theresa May, Gordon Cameron, Keir Starmer and the guy with the wild hair that people thought was cool for a while, but turned out to be just another traitor.

        Trump has said he would favor imprisonment in El Salvador for Americans who commit certain crimes.   If that is ever instituted you can bet the policy will morph into sending Americans there for “hate speech” or “misinformation.”
IMHO the war on whites and their civil rights will continue in spite of what JD Vance says.

You can bet those five women also have lots more bastards by lots more guys.We do need to have children, lots of children, both for our own happiness and our own future and for our future as a people… but we’ll never outbreed the nons (so long as they have our food and medical care keeping them alive anyway).Ultimately they have to go back to their own places because pure population growth is about the only math based competition they can possibly ever win

        “Woke” may be waning in Trump’s America, at least temporarily, but certain subjects are becoming even more taboo. Darryl Cooper apparently got the call. To be fair, he basically admitted on twitter that they threatened his children.
This why the incels are on to something. You can’t be in this game if you have a family- not in the face of neo-Lanskyite Murder, Inc. You have to be like Fuentes in his bunker, or Z in the fortress of solitude (I’m sure Z will appreciate the comparison!)

            Yes. To fight in this war, you must carry minimum collateral that can be weaponized against you. The enemy prefers to target your loved ones, job, bank account, reputation.
It is a warrior-monk calling, exactly. A church militant. Little wonder that the enemy labels those monks ‘incels’, concentrating fire on them and ascribing to them every negative event occurring in North America. Especially females experiencing Bad Feels.

                        I never said anything about family men assuming unnecessary risks, my own days on the front line are largely behind me and it is very much a young, single man’s game. But such men must also eventually matriculate, having a family has never exempted anyone from having to fight for them in at least some capacity, and without them the fight has no point. The yahoos he’s talking about are more akin to a gaggle of anti-SJW degens circa 2015 than koryos/mannerbund types, and within the substantial context of his own self-admitted life trajectory and preoccupation with women, he’s full of it. Thomas Rousseau might fit the bill better as far as the minimum of family entanglements, but he’s no monk.Nick Fuentes is just a (barely) closeted homosexual.

                    You strike me as a Tradcon who relishes in the idea of men sacrificing themselves for thankless, disloyal women or your personal political agenda.  MGTOW simply points out all the land mines modern society sets out for men to step on and destroy their life.  Maybe that doesn’t bother you, maybe you’ll say they should just ‘man up’, but it is precisely people like you that ensure young, single men stay that way.

                        I’m closer to a Stakhanovite than a tradcon, though I’m not one of those either. I don’t relish the thought of anyone sacrificing themselves for thankless, disloyal moids, I’ve had more than my share of them and their attendant travails myself. But that really isn’t MGTOW’s pitch, it’s bait and switch, like reductionist boobs who would have us believe the first mammoth hunter to barter meat for shelter invented capitalism. Most manosphere figures past and present belong in their own gulag down the river from the one for unrepentant whores.

                If the trends hold, we’re going to have a large and growing group of unencumbered men to recruit from.  I find myself granting more leniency to commentators that have families specifically because I understand they have mouths to feed and may have to temper their message.  Thus, it is up to us ‘warrior-monks’ to really push the envelope on the controversial topics.

            Haven’t kept up with the Cooper news recently, but I found it kind of impressive that the hit on him was just totallymade up. Anyone could always have checked, simply by listening to him. Nobody did.His worst flaw as a commentator on 20th century politics is that he’s aninsufferableHolocaust sentimentalist. He literally cries when speaking of the eternal innocence of the Jews—especially the mass murdering ones.So they got him with “neonazi,” “Hitler apologist,” etc., the whole list. Even Derb just fucking lies about him.A reminder, in case Trump’sbecoming imaginaryhasn’t really sunk in the lesson, that what you actually do and who you really are doesn’t matter at all. You will be made symbolic. You are whiteness.

                Cooper may have turned tail and that’s unfortunate but to get to this point he came on a huge public forum with his own face and his own name and told a LOT of truth about WW2 (the most sacred of all their high holy days).I havent ever experienced the entirety of the infernal machine and its golems turning an angry eye towards little ol’ me and I doubt anyone else here has either, so I’d be cautious about being too hard on him.  He spoke out and took an unimaginable risk directly provoking the most evil and powerful people on planet earth and that deserves credit whatever happens after

Then figure in that soon, if not already, I won’t be able to travel there (or probably anywhere by air) without surrendering biometric information.Boarding passes and check-in to be ditched in biggest airport shake up. Which I’ll probably be subject to anyway next time I go to renew my driver’s license.But anyhow, this notion of morality driven foreign policy is now and was always ludicrous.  De Gaulle was right, nations have interests, not friends, and trying to pretend that we have shared interests when we don’t is also ludicrous, which is the result of declaring some nations to be our permanent friends (i.e. NATO). “Allied” with people who hate us. Because democracy, or something. All we have to do to bring out their true feelings about us is elect the wrong president. To hell with them.

            One of the manyreasons I did not travel to a Fulbrightreunion in England back in theoughts (besides being being broke) was that I was genuinely afraid of being banned from entering the country due to my online posts in the US.  Aside from the fact that Irefuse to fly anymore, I would not travel to the UK today – if you are not concerned with being arrested or refused entry, you should be.  My past experience is that their immigration officers are far more serious than ours.

                    I think it was 30 years on some of the things he (most likely) wrote, and they were in obscure forums, too. Some weird back-in-the-day forums. lol He probably doesn’t even know for sure that he wrote some of the things, but suspects he did. Yet, CNN had the posts.
That was one of the biggest takeaways from the whole affair, besides being like, “Damn!’ lol on some of the things he posted. It was that somehow CNN had all these 30 year old posts from obscure forums back then. Pretty wild.

        Apartheid, or some other caste-based system such as existed in New Spain, is quite literally the only way Western civilization can endure within formerly European countries like South Africa. Today’s abuses of human rights in Europe are an implicit acknowledgement of the incompatibility of diverse populations forced into proximity with one another. Just as Jim Crow laws meant that blacks couldn’t behave as they wished in the white-dominated South, the British cannot live in accordance with their ancient customs if they are to be “welcoming” to immigrants. It’s not so much about rights as it is about who gets to decide, to paraphrase our highly-respected essayist. You want to live in a Western society, then it’s got to be run by Europeans—sorry José.

TLDR, they suck because their best and brightest and most heroic died in the mud 100 years ago.

        The bonds of kinship and friendship between the US and the “Olde Country(s)” have been weakening at an accelerating pace in the past 50 years.The Immigration Act of 1924 set targets to represent the US population nationality/ethnicity of the 1890 census.The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 ended that, thank you very much.  (also encouraged family based immigration).As the country becomes a hodge podge of ethnic micro colonies (see, 90 foot bronze Hindu idol erected in Sugar Land TX, or the exclusively Sharia law/muslim only community development also in TX)….It’s hard to relate to my own “fellow citizens”, much less European countries that self-immolate every 50 years or so.They are not us.

            ‘We’ are not us anymore either.  I’m willing to bet the number/percentage of White Americans who actually share the majority of my political, economic, and social views is about the same as those Europeans who do – i.e. quite small.  I would not be so quick to write off all native Europeans.  Yes, I’ve met the worst of them (a German woman married to an American who was vocal in her anti-American hate and nonexistent security concerns in a then east bloc nation) and many of the best – basically decent, cultured, friendly, and helpful people on whom the very concept of a ‘heritage American’ is based.

            “how do these native euro politicians and political parties expect to remain in power, when the 3rd worlders they are importing will throw them out at the first opportunity?”Let’s not assume that they aren’t suicidal, that they don’t seek atonement through self-destruction. Our subcontinent has had a morality of guilt tripping and masochism for more than 1,000 years. The new doctrine of original sin is not nearly as different from the old as many readers here would like to believe.The pretext for it was changed, and the class of those with the stain of originated original sin has been reduced from all of humanity to only “white” people, namely, Caucasians, Slavs, Magyars, and so on. Further, there’s no opportunity for redemption, only for atonement, and the latter is to be accomplished though willing acceptance of destruction.

                Suicide bombers aren’t suicidal. They value something else over life. Sometimes it’s a future vision or a philosophy, and sometimes it’s simplyyour death.
Europe’s politicians may believe the strange American things they say to justify their misrule. It’s not necessary that they do. And for us to think that they do, we have to believe what they say. We shouldn’t.
They’re not visionaries or philosophers. They’re mere criminals—notpetty, but mere.

        American Apartheid is 60+ years old, targeting lower-and-middle class white men and boys. This mass disenfranchisement is self-servingly called Being on the Right Side of History. Herstory. Itstory.The corporations openly and proudly discriminate against them; the courts are fem-prog star-chambers, cacklehouses; State and Federal government disenfranchise them with undisguised glee and much preening.Top of the Apartheid stack is Women. Then children generally (aka womenandchildren). Then household pets. And finally on the bottom males, with strong emphasis on white males: these need to be Taken Down a Few Notches and Put in their Place. Over and over and over.Europe runs the American Game Plan, largely out of Bitchdom Brussels. The U.S. needs to clean its own house before pointing fingers at Ms. Europa.J.D. is the only Trump Administration official having the vaguest idea of American Apartheid, having experienced some himself. He needs to back up his European speech with more verbal pressure combined with hard policy proposals. Make American Apartheid his 4-year priority.I don’t think Trump would back this, as he was born into wealth beyond apartheid, and is a quiet feminist and liberal.

        America’s Cold War moral crusade for American Values, Western Values, Freedom, Democracy … … was just a facade. It was the excuse that let the empire and its dispossessed citizenry pretend it wasn’t an empire. The reality is, the core moral pillar of this empire was, ultimately, anti-White and anti-Western (by definition).For the GAE to resume this crusade is a non-starter. It was never sincere. What the crusade must be, the only one that will reverse this tide, is a crusade for the ethnic European people of the world. Anything short of that is starting with an apology that we can see the hostile outsiders will only see as more permission.Some sinking ethnic European society must be the one who stands up for its people. The more powerful that society is, the more likely it is to be the shockwave that creates the tidalwave of identitarian fervor that is our only salvation.Snippet from the guys at Imperium Press today that outlines the intensifying tribal war across The West.“We are of course in that sweet spot today, all across the West. Western elites are well aware of this, and are actively working to “solve” the problem. The “solution” to the threat of a mass movement will involve one of two approaches: either a) fragmentation can be rolled back, or b) fragmentation can be accelerated. The former approach is what people in the radical right like Martin Sellner have been calling for, in the form of “remigration”; the latter approach is that being advanced by the governance structure of Western countries. This is what the Great Replacement is all about: Western elites are deliberately and actively pushing our societies toward being too fractured to explode. The Great Replacement is not specifically about anti-whiteness, though in ethnically white countries it necessarily takes anti-white forms. The Great Replacement is more precisely about keeping elites in their positions of dominance, resources from being radically redistributed—and above all,it is about keeping society running.As multiculturalism has begun to fail spectacularly—in the assessment of Western elites themselves—sovereign authorities have played a gambit of “controlled demolition”. They have pushed society downhill toward a chasm, but rather than hit the brakes, they have decided to jump the gap, and so have put the pedal to the metal. They are doubling down like Pentheus inThe Bacchae, awareon some level that their chosen course is catastrophic, and that very awareness drives them to hysteria when confronted with the evil that they have wrought.”

                I mean, it happens here too. The RNC used its first night invocation to pray to a foreign demon god instead of Jesus Christ (who, IIRC, was never actually mentioned by anyone, in any prayer or otherwise, at that conference). It isn’t just about religion, either – remember last year when the Biden admin put out a statement about “Trans Day of Visibility” on Easter Sunday?

        We could be experiencing peak “Woke EU” these days. They simply cannot afford this level of idiocy going forward. You cannot import this many savages and have a functioning economy while supporting an enormous pension/public healthcare burden. This is true even if defense spending is nil, let alone the 3% Trump wants from them. Something’s gotta give. WWII is a distant memory here. The younger Americans don’t care about Europe and many don’t have ethnic ties to it. NATO won’t make its 100th birthday. As I’ve joked here before, the next King of England will be a Sultan.

                Exactly. Additionally, given Europe and the UK are infinitely better off demographically than the United States, there is more hope for our brothers there, and if they are able to shake off their oppression, it would inspire our brothers here to emulate them.

                    I agree CW. I wasn’t proposing to save anybody. The ones who will be saved are the ones who will save themselves and who will find and band together with the others who have the will and agency to do so. I estimate that will be about 30%. That is a good number who can and will take over a territory and use it as a base for many generations of renewal and then upward resumption of our destiny.At some point another 10-15 may come knocking on the gates when living in a separate sleeping quarters/prison-cell to survive each night of nogvasion becomes too problematic.

            There are glimmers of hope. Germany is turning away so-called asylum seekers at her borders, for instance. It’s a start, but they have a long, long way to go to restore anything like a semblance of what existed even a few decades past.

                Glimmers huh. The recent German election changed nothing. Le Pen has been chained. In Spain, the guy used trickery to maintain power. Starmer rules with minimal support. Although I read that a neo-Fascist group has formed in Milan to harass migrants, so maybe that’s a glimmer……

            European and especially UK wokeness is a product of the American empire so as our empire collapses there’s a chance that some of the countries there can shake off the woke chains. Basically, the US ruling class finances and supports their counterparts in the UK and Europe. Without that support, Europe’s ruling class is on its own and can hopefully be replaced by populist natives.Of course, our ruling class will (rightly) fight hard to avoid that outcome. If even a few European nations started really kicking out the wogs and keeping more from flooding in, while at the same time rejecting the Green fascism you see in Germany, that country would become a rally point for our own White dissidents – “why can’t we do it like xxx does?!?!”European, UK, and American dissidents should become a mutually bolstering triad of peoples, sharing tactics, strategies, and ideas across the ocean.

        Interesting that “political prisoner” is a term which is never used by western government media outside of the Uhigers in China.  This is not an accident.
By every consistent measure, Tommy Robinson and effectively all of the January 6 protesters are/ were political prisoners: enemies of the state.
For some reason, Israel is allowed to support a final solution to the discrepancy in their treatment of their muslim/ Christian neighbors.

        The arrests of non-citizens criticizing Israel has already demolished any credibility he could have had on thisIt is now becoming a serious problem for firms that rely on international travel to conduct business.  Employers are having trouble getting their international branch associates to travel to the U.S. for projects because those employees have publicly criticized Israel in their home countries.  They are free to speak at home, but they could end up in a detention center for an indefinite period before being deported if they risk traveling here for work.If you don’t believe the left won’t use this precedent when they are back in power, you get another “fell for it again” award.

            The “left,” if and when it returns to power, will be possessed of an unholy vengeance, regardless of what the Trump admin does or doesn’t do. Backing off from this or that policy will not change that at all. If anything, it is all the more reason to double down. Although like you (or any reasonable person), I am not a fan of punishing people for antisemitisms.

                Definitely! Locking people up for opinions is absurd. (Tossing them out of helicopters for certain opinions, OTOH… 😉 )
Situational awareness should be a thing, though. Right or wrong, current American policy has a hard-on for what it considers “antisemitism”. Same with machine guns and tax evasion, even though I am opposed to those policies, too. But am I willing to spend a decade in an Argentinian embassy for coloring past those lines? Nope. Certainly not just to be a keyboard warrior.

            Look, I detest Israel and Trump’s zionism, but enough with the “the left will use ‘x’ against us” when it’s ‘their turn again.”  The left originated the whole damned playbook!  They already used every aspect of lawfare – arrests and imprisonment for praying and speech, prosecution for thought, and every possible exercise of ‘legal’ power against Whites.  They did and would and will do this in any event, because they hate Whites and want Whites dispossessed and ultimately miscegenated/dead.  To unilaterally disarm and proclaim defeat because the other side might use one’s rules and laws against one – where the hell have you been the past 75-100 years?

The whole original article was about using moral authority to protect individual liberties
As soon as I criticize Trump for not respecting liberties you guys kick in with
”let’s be tyrants before the left does it to us”
Actually I would prefer Trump be tyrannical on immigration, but you guys can’t have both ways.
You can either be a tough guy and save your country or you can be a preening moralizer to Europe.

                            The Isrealis didn’t need a pretext to genocide the Palestinians.
They could have done it anyway, but they are barely keeping their image together even with the pretext of 10-7.
Had they started bombing Gaza totally out of the blue- it would have been infinitely worse for them.
So I hard disagree with you, pretexts do in fact mater and lack of pretext does restrain the left.

                Despite the OP’s concerns there’s no need to wait for the left to have their turn with it for us to become collateral, the current administration is on the fast track to doing it themselves. There’s calling danger close artillery down on your overrun position in final defensive fire, and there’s hurtling headlong into your own creeping barrage. The likely casualty ratios are not acceptable, and the ammunition being expended is being diverted from other, worthier efforts.

The Ulstermen might be okay if they can stop seeing themselves as kindred settler spirits to the yids and cooler heads among them and their different flavored Gael counterparts can come to an accommodation.

                ” To unilaterally disarm and proclaim defeat because the other side might use one’s rules and laws against one – where the hell have you been the past 75-100 years?”This argument is absurd.This policy is not helping U.S. citizens, it is a high risk move that gains us nothing and activates the left to take revengeI have watched the Patriot Act get turned against conservatives.  This is act was passed in the heat of the moment after 9/11 and would not likely have been implemented by Obama at a later date if Bush had failed to support itSo yes, stupid tyranny does give the left an excuse/tools to be tyrannical against us.If the “tyranny” was for a good cause, like say executing judges who block deportations I would be willing to take the chance because that involves an existential issue to our survival.Once again Trump is taking a shot at the king and missingHe is the absolute worst flip-flopping cuck you could have elected, and you will pay for it.

                    To use the Patriot Act against Americans was the intent of the Patriot Act all along.
To a paranoid D.C. bureaucrat, everyone is a potential scary “terr0rist” and he lives in total existential dread of being fired from his cushy government job for failing to identify you as one.
“They hate our freedom” as George W. said but he never said who “they” were. I’d assume that they were his foreign employers who parachuted him into the White House to serve as their errand boy for the 9/11 publicity stunt.

        Serious question. How bad does it have to get before we hoist the Black Flag? How far down this path is the point of no return? When the time comes, will it be berserk mode, lynch mob, street riot, civil war, or something entirely new and modern? Or will we mewl meekly to the slaughterhouse as sheeple? Methinks a Braveheart will arise and it will be bloody. Live or die, it will be a good day to grasp the broadsword with both hands.

                I often wonder about this myself.  Time after time we say “it can’t be done”, yet we have a historical record of military conflicts where it *has* been done—to us, and we had the largest military in the world at the time.
Are we not better, tougher, smarter than rice farmers in a paddy, or goat herders in the mountains?  If not, then perhaps we deserve the “inevitable”.

        The policies are created by white people and enforced by white people (the white police). It is another reminder that the agents of force (police and military) feel solidarity with those who sign their paychecks, not the people they are supposed to protect. BTW, the beginning of this were the laws criminalizing “Holocaust Denial” (i.e., any quibbling with the whole gas chamber/6 million thing).

        Great essay but what you recommend likely will not happen. The hostile elites who run the United States oppose civil liberties in a fashion identical to their European counterparts; quite often, they are of the same ethnicity. American elites seek to maximize profits at the expense of all other considerations, and will do nothing to promote human rights if that interferes with the bottom line. Opposition to South African apartheid, which was a proper and justified policy, arose only when support of the Praetoria government became too expensive and a hinderance in the Cold War, by way of example.American elites have not fully emulated the European totalitarians, at least yet, because it would hit them in the pocketbook domestically because of American resistance. So the current program is to exploit/cooperate with Europe as much as possible, maintain occupation troops there in the event of a peasant uprising, and to act in an opposite manner in their base country until/unless the day arrives that open authoritarianism can be inexpensively imposed on the United States. The Biden Administration gave a taste of what that would resemble, and states and local jurisdictions would be well-advised to make preparations to extract an extreme cost if/when it happens.If this take is wrong, that will be known immediately once Britain requires Musk to hand over user information. Gab has resisted this and pulled the plug in the UK, but Torba’s platform is a fly and X/Twitter is an elephant. And if we see that type of resistance from Musk and others, maybe there will be Color Revolutions in Britain, France and Germany to take out the totalitarians. I wouldn’t bet the farm on it, though.

                Bad writing on my part. The policy OF apartheid was proper and justified. American opposition to that policy arose only once it became an issue the USSR used to gain power, and also once it became expensive to maintain relations with Praetoria.
Editing and clarifying now.

        No, more than ever America must break ties with any nation in the Eastern Hemisphere-yes including Israel- but especially England and Europe..., who are in any case too weak to be saved.  Impossible to save those who don’t want to be saved.In particular anyone who can get beat by Starmer and his pet feral Bobbies is beneath contempt or any redemption.

        Almost forgotten now is Tommy Robinson, a street activist who opposes the importation of Muslims and other immigrants. He has been in jail for so long that people have forgotten about him, which is the point. No one seems to know why he is in jail, other than that he says things in public that the government says white people should never say, not even in private. In the United Kingdom, like many European Union countries, you can be sent to prison for private speech.Mr. Yaxley-Lennon has been in jail for approximately six months and is, today, in the headlines of dozens of newspapers for losing his appeal of the remaining year of that sentence. The man is a shill, an embezzler, and inveterate gambler by his own admission, with a long history of punching right and making common cause with hostile aliens to decry anti-Semitism. He deserves worse from any one of us here than he has ever got from the British government.

        China has much more free speech than any European country, with the only limitation being that it’s unwise to criticize Xi or the CCP, although constructive criticism within the CCP is permitted by Xi….And that’s why they are kicking the West’s butt in technology…

            “…although constructive criticism within the CCP is permitted by Xi…”Really?A quick review from ChatGPT:“The moment you’re referring to happened at the 20th Party Congress in October 2022. It was an unusual and widely discussed scene: during the closing session, Hu Jintao — who had served as China’s president and party leader from 2002 to 2012 — was unexpectedly escorted out of the Great Hall of the People in front of the assembled delegates, with Xi Jinping sitting impassively right beside him.”Not to post all details, but it appears to me the same old, same old from communist party types and quite typical for China from Mao on.  I suppose Xi could accept criticism and rivals if they are neutered sufficiently.   😉

        I have only read the title of this blog post so far, but it reminds me of a term I coined during the Covidiocy: Vaccine Apartheid. (Heck, Z’s commenter are so smart that someone above could have already used the term and I haven’t yet read it)…And I enjoyed using this term with a small local theater where I wanted to take a course. Because I hadn’t had the clot shot, they weren’t allowing me to participate in the class.Then a few months later I wrote an email to them again, again asking sime: “Are you guys still operating under your Vaccine Apartheid rules?”Naturally I got no response.Bur it sure felt good.I live using that word precisely BECAUSE it is so emotionally charged.So if we use it purposefully to push other peoples’ buttons, it can be a joyful experience.Joy.Remember that term, from the Cameltoe campaign?

        OT: saw a Jared Taylor article on Unz this morning talking genetic engineering as eugenics. Only lefties want to be ugly, weak, and stupid lol. Out of the loop, wasn’t aware it was already that political. Comments weren’t too warm, thankfully.
Biology (God’s tech) will win, because we’re not dealing with it on its own terms, i.e., breeding. I’m cool with good breeding, call it eugenics if you like. We’re treating it like our soulless man-made tech, and that’s a grave mistake imo.

Certainly, but possibly not for us (Whites).  If the government here is in control, they may only allow certain modifications to the embryo.  For example, no girls vs boys selection, no IQ selection, etc.  Such is the insanity of the present populace/politics.
Other countries, example China, may not be under such constraints.  Smarter Chinese are probably suboptimal for America.

        Free speech is a double-edged sword. There are valid criticisms of it. You have to think for yourself, be your own authority, not be a sheep or an NPC. Call it revolutionary, I suppose it is in the extreme. Still, it’s something we Americans used to negotiate.

            Completing the thought (break’s over!), I’m fully over on the demographic side of things. We negotiated it, because it’s our culture. You can say it, but everybody knows it’s over the line. Somebody might even call you out, no big deal. Other people don’t have that, Europeans even, apparently.
We’re right at the tipping point, last gasp or not.

        Billy Strings: ambassador of deathLast week I made an impulse purchase based on a breathless substack post praising Billy strings as the savior of American music by a guy typing as “ringleader”. After spending $150 for me and a friend, I thought I’d better get to know some of his music.I needed to get out of the house and  that I don’t regret, and it was around my people, but the show was boring.Every great band or performer is so not simply because of they are masters of their instruments and have a good voice: they must have a unique sound or catchy original songs.Billy strings had neither. I don’t think I would care or be writing this unless a guy calling zimself Tucker Carlson didn’t say this:“to see Billy Strings become a venue packer, a BIG act right now… I don’t feel like creativity, art, has been completely destroyed and eliminated in the United States.”Bluegrass that morphs into psychedelia or other genres like jazz is 50 years old. David grisman, was doing it in the late 70s; bela fleck and mark O’Connor in the 80s and after the Grateful Dead left a void in jam band fan’s lives by prematurely breaking up, “space-grass” had a life in the 90s. I think the most similar artist to strings was Larry keel. Keel was a virtuoso guitarist who went off into long improvisations and added reggae to his cover lists: he loved bob marley.A guy like keel and strings have had three tricks up their sleeves: high energy fast picking that sometimes left the key of the song to give it a sophisticated exploratory feel; this is interesting for maybe 10 minutes.The next thing they have is covers. They have to have songs to play fancy solos over, right? So they pick popular songs (bluegrass or whatever, keel did a lot of reggae) and do their flashy solos over top that. That’s interesting because these are great songs and it’s nice to hear great songs played well. There’s nothing wrong with that. Both keel and strings do this.Then there is the last trick: original songs.  There is no way you are going to be a stadium act, like strings is , without original songs. Guys like keel had mediocre original songs and played coffee houses or at best theaters like all self respecting bluegrass acts.So how does strings sell out stadiums ? Billy strings original songs suck. Look them up for yourselves: Dust in a Baggie, Richard Petty , Everythings the Same (the video of this howler even seems to mock 1950s white america) They have no melodic interest, no hooks, and no variety. The lyrics seem written by a 15 year old.His sound is old fashioned, in some cases 50 years old, others, like 40. His guitar playing is fast but I bet Nashville has a bunch of guitarist who are as good  as he. In fact there is a guy on YouTube playing one of strings solos with one finger. . Strings  voice is excellent but nothing more than a stock country voice.So, Larry keel, Marc O’Connor, and Tony Trishka did the same thing, why are you complaining, Mr ya? Because they didn’t fill stadiums and no one called them the savior of American creativity. So why is it that strings is making 150k a night while Larry keel gets a free meal and the tip jar?My humble opinion is that America, the American people, are so soulless and dead inside, that Billy strings is an outward manifestation of our poverty. He is a traveling  gravestone appearing around the country announcing our emptiness and it resonates with us.That stadium was filled with our people. Not one African, not one Arab, not one Latino did I see. What’s more, one of the light effects was the Star of David i kid you not.Now I’m not actually criticizing Billy strings. He’s just doing his thing, I think it’s boring, but he is a fantastic singer and guitar player. I’m only saying his popularity is due to our poverty, not his merit.Nothing will ignite our people if our people don’t think they exist. So what do you get? Billy strings, ambassador of death.Now, it’s possible that this sad uncreate period we are living through could end, it’s possible the American people could positively identify themselves as a people and thus produce culture, but warmed up 90s spacegrass  isnt a sign of that.This is the most interesting song it’s has and it’s not that interesting:https://youtu.be/N5ZCbrcjrA4?si=rWaC19KjzsWr8uw0What was the topic?

            Mr Ya – Have you ever checked out Tony Rice, perhaps the greatest bluegrass guitarist ever?  He covered many Lightfoot songs in the 70s and 80s giving the songs totally new arrangements with bluegrass flair. Lightfoot was one of the greatest song writers ever IMO, and his music and lyrics coupled with TR’s arrangements, wicked instrumentation, and his soothing baritone voice are something to behold. Suggest you check out especially three albums from the 80s: Cold on the Shoulder, Me and My Guitar, and Native American.   Enjoy.

                    Agreed.  The Tony Rice covers are just a more uptempo bluegrass arrangement of Gordo’s great songs.  And TR has some of the best bluegrass impresarios supporting him (David Gresham, Vasser Clements, and Jerry Douglas).  I strongly recommend giving these songs a listen.

                I’m a semi-professional guitarist/composer/multi-instrumentalist. I’ve never heard any of these Yeggs; I should probably keep things “as-is”. That said, I remark that the “general rot” of modern Country Music (and American popular culture in general) is indicative of…?

                    I didn’t say these songs were popular.  I said they were good.

            You got a bunch of downvotes but I get what you’re on about.  There is very little originality or creativity in modern America.  Some of this is due to woke and feminism, and some is due to, as you say, the general cognitive and creative decline of our people.

                One of the first singers I dropped due to personal politics over entertainment.  Can’t stand him any more.  He also went South (sold out ?) after second album,The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle, but it was good while it lasted.

                    I enjoyed some of his tunes and saw him in the late Eighties at Shoreline Amp. during my Career Phase in San Francisco.
Then he started talking about how boys and girls all should use the same restroom and boom, I don’t play his stuff anymore. I could have tolerated some leftism from him, but then he showed me he was a Convert, imbibing and disseminating every single tenet of their religion.
