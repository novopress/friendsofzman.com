        Trump’s 2nd major pitch to his base (his first is that he is Donald Trump and everyone else is not) was that he understood how DC worked after his first term and had a plan to fix the problem. None of his enemies really believed that, because they think he is stupid and just wanted to be President to “enrich himself” or something (which makes no sense, because he’s already rich and the feds would have been happy to let him slink away in silence to Mar-a-Lago after the 2020 color revolution). Obviously they were clearly wrong as this as been in the planning stages for years. The tech bros have infused his operation with a level of competence that we haven’t seen from ANY government operation in decades, while he has managed to keep a firm hand on policy. Obviously the blob is upset, and it will counter, but the momentum is not on their side. It’s not like they are competent at anything. I read a post on Reddit yesterday where a guy whose entire career is in “international development” is up the creek now. In other words, he does no real work, has no accountability, can’t do real work, but nonetheless has a cushy lifestyle sucking off the government teat. If these are our enemies, then we should be positive.

            I’ve never understood where the, “Trump is stupid,” meme came from.
Certainly, he does often speak in a brusque, salt-of-the-earth manner.
However, one doesn’t become a billionaire, international real estate mogul, and international celebrity for over four decades without a high level of intelligence.
On the flip side, I’ve said for years that all these liberal arts degrees are based on nothing more than four years of worthless word salad in the communist indoctrination camps called, “universities.”

                I’d be surprised if Trump’s IQ is below 150.

                    There are people who rate him that high via questionable logic and analysis, but I doubt it.  He is however, not a dullard.  I’d say he was, at his prime and given his Wharton School experience, around 130 give or take 5 points.  However, that was then, this is now.  As you enter into your 60’s and 70’s (Trump is late 70’s) your IQ declines. “Fluid” as early as late 20’s and “concrete” into the late 60’s.Fluid intelligence can crudely be interpreted as putting together facts and ideas into new forms to create discovery.  Concrete intelligence the accumulation of facts.  Concrete intelligence rises until 60’s, then declines.  We find any number of Nobel prize winners receiving their prizes at advanced age for discoveries made in their 20’s and 30’s.Trump may be an exception here, but I’d not count on it.  I don’t require the President to be “the smartest guy in the room”.  I expect him to be the dumbest guy in the room having surrounded himself with the best and the brightest.  Trump needs only that he be able to spot and select those people.As to intellectual decline into old age, I see such in myself.  It is a fact that the brain grows smaller with advanced age.  I have the MRI’s to prove it.  I no longer make many decisions spontaneously as I once did, but rather sleep on it.  So far, better decisions have been produced with longer wait times.  This never was the case in my youth.  But as the body slows down, so does the mind.  Of course, that never stops one from talking/writing gibberish all too readily.   But then again, I’m not the President and my musings are meaningless.  🙂

                        The subjects of his IQ or personal morality don’t interest me in the slightest. What I find fascinating are his drive and resilience. I cannot imagine what it would be like to have literal nation states pulling all the stops to destroy me and pick me apart. I find myself needing naps after a hard day of yard work… and I’m a quarter century younger. Is he just “built that way”? Does narcissism make him immune to the tidal waves of attacks? Ego? Beyond my ken.

                            Some people just seem to be born with more energy than the rest of us. I’ve observed this all my life. And it doesn’t appear to have anything to do with the outward appearance of physical fitness.

                            I don’t know if it declines, I just think you don’t have tolerance for stupidities. Who’s going to sit and focus on some IQ test at my age? I have better things to do.

                                You and Ray may be the exceptions via the reasons cited, but there are many studies which confirm this in different ways.  As always, the comments are made to reflect the average person or normative exemplar.  There are exceptions or outliers to most any finding such as this.You get old, your thinking skills as measured by most IQ tests diminish.  If for nothing else, they are usually timed scores on tests.  Hence the comment of “sleeping on it” for a better decision making process.  Then of course, there is the aspect of wisdom, which comes from age and experience.  That too is often a good compensatory mechanism in old age.

                        The rapidity with which Trump responds to new information reminds me a lot of my dad. Though not the impulsiveness. I’d bump your estimate 10 points. 150? Hard to know. The smartest guy I ever knew told me he saw how little reasoning ability most people would have to have to match him. He just could not accept that it was an unbridgeable gap. It just looked to easy to him.

                        3 points each decade after hitting 40. That likely refers to the “fluid” while the “concrete” intelligence remains the same (until doddering time). You know what you know and struggle to learn what you don’t.

                    There’s no chance it is.It’s out of fashion now, but nerds on the internet used to point out, over and over again, that to a genius (in IQ terms), the typical midwit—a respectably credentialed professional or Job Creator™—is likely to seem literally retarded. “To the physicist, the chemist appears to have Down syndrome.” Stuff like that.It’s not quite true. Actual idiots have outbursts of insight and some difficultly learned wisdom about everyday life. The above-average never do. When they think they do, they’re repeating something they don’t understand. They’retrulystupid.Trump is one of very few present-day public figures who doesn’t give that impression. His mistakes come from personality flaws and axiomatic errors—being an obsolete boomer businessman, basically—not incapacity. People who think he “rambles” (just like Biden!some of our guys have started to say) areslow,the conversational equivalent of illiterate.I think it was Neil Oliver who pointed out that Trump talks like a “great character,” as in a great novel. Bad writers hate him! (They do.) He makes a unique andimitableflow of words, like he’s come alive fromThe Pickwick Papers. I remember thegood studentsat school complaining that it was too hard to read.

                        “I remember thegood studentsat school complaining that it was too hard to read.”Today’s students find a restaurant menu too hard to read.  That’s because no one reads any more.  When I was in HS, we had to read Shakespeare’s plays.  Reading—difficult reading—requires not only IQ, but practice.  In the modern era of electronic devices and ubiquitous media, no one reads.  Most likely because it takes too long and we only have 15 minute concentration intervals—but also we have a huge influx of non English speakers as well.  It’s been shown that multilingualism in the home is an obstacle to English proficiency.Here in my Hispanic burg, the last reports were that only 22% of students were at State reading proficiency levels, and only 13% at State proficiency math levels.  I believe that was for grade school.

                “Certainly, he does often speak in a brusque, salt-of-the-earth manner.”Here’s the thing. I am a [Big City Hard Accent-ville], not from [Uptown part of said City]. I can slip into the ‘tongue’ of my youth easily, when I want to. Based on the audience.I can also step out of it, just as easily.So, dealing with some weakling neu-male, say, no accent. Or maybe, to make them release urine into their Depends, hard accent. On an everyday basis, nice soft tones.Who is to say Trump is not at least as verbally equipped as nobody little old me? Is that really too hard to fathom? What is the collective IQ, verbal IQ of the American audience?Third Grade.

                    This is just “spoiled grapes” talking.  There are variations of Musk hate throughout the Internet.  Seems all successful people attract haters.  Musk’s history in the tech field belies such idiocy.  He was a genius when he arrived in the US and has been successful in any number of tech endeavors, which illustrates his abilities.  He is however a dreamer and often out of touch with reality (MHO) with some of his outlandish ideas.  That’s fine.  We need those people as well.  As long as he’s willing to put his money where his mouth is…

                Z has talked about this before. It’s about whether or not you adhere to the official state religion of liberal democracy and progressivism. There is a whole set of beliefs and speech that comes with it, and it is constantly evolving. It is why say the entire liberal establishment got on board with transgenderism at the same time, or all of the sudden became ardent defenders of “our sacred democracy.” They believe anyone who doesn’t go along with this is stupid, quite frankly. Well, stupid or a con man, because that’s the only possible way someone could not believe in this. And we are seeing a lot of this now. Go on websites where fed workers are discussing the situation amongst themselves. These beliefs have not gone away, and I do think they all underestimated Trump and the anger at them that has been building for years.

I was not alone in disliking the kweer, but thought it good politics to thank him specifically for the gay rights glossary. My thanking the kweer for the glossary offended him.

                For most people, liberal arts degrees are like the European tours upper-class children used to take before coming back home to take on adult responsibilities.  I.e., they’re a luxury.  The idea that society at large should fund those vacations with their taxes is absurd.I’m as guilty as any of them, I suppose, having a bachelor’s degree in philosophy that I paid for using the GI Bill benefits I earned as a REMF in Vietnam.  Didn’t lead to any gainful employment, naturally. It was only because I later taught myself to program in C that I was able to have a useful, productive career.

                The Floridian Wiles apparently being so effective is causing me to get a little bit optimistic about the Floridian Bondi, a longtime associate of Wiles, who I hear was pushed by Wiles for the AG job. So far we’ve heard very little from Bondi, but perhaps when we do, it will be significant. I really should know better than to get my hopes up.

            Long rant incoming, buckle up—Those type of people you describe as the “international development” Reddit cry baby are absolutelylegionin the DC area and its surrounding swampy suburbs. Armies of paper pushers, NGO do nothings, feckless bureaucrats, all of it.Being that I am sadly ‘from’ the swamp though certainly not OF the swamp I know at least 4 Nice White Ladies (NWLs) who fall squarely in this camp. All highly educated middle aged women. The kind that proudly put their “no human is illegal, hate has no home here, and BLM” signs in their yard. The all live in Arlington or similar areas where no illegal beaners, violet negros, or their other ‘pets’ they so proudly support can afford to live. Luxury beliefs all the way down.The 4 of them have spent their entire lives in the cloud as lesser functionaries. Strongly imbibing the vapors of sh-tlibbery and its attendant belief system, messaging, rituals, catechisms. I.E. They have “religion” whether call it as such or not, it is 100% a secular religion. Likewise, with this massive freeze on the unending gravy train the 4 of them are all having massive anxiety attacks and have likely upped their anti-depressant doses massively. I have some passive confirmation of this through friend of friends channels, social media, etc. USAID, International Rescue Committee, etc. They have an existential fear now they have never known, and though I know some of them personally and they are “good” people in the very lefty misguided sense, I’d be lying if I didn’t say I have a certain amount of schadenfreude watching them experience what “Tuesday” in Appalachia looks like finally.Basically, groups of young and middle aged liberal white women who have never known a day of hardship in their lives whose feet have never touched the ground in some cases turning their natural mothering instincts and altruism outwards to black and brown aliens who care nothing about them in return. Teach them how to build a well, how to rotate crops. In 6 months, it is all in disrepair. Oh well! Just give them food and water so they can breed prolifically like rabbits. Try teaching roaches rotation farming, it is about the same success rate. Yet they go about their world destroying mission with vigor by letting Africans breed FAR beyond their natural limits because ANY day now, they will learn how to keep that well from running dry.As Doogie Howser so astutely pointed out in Starship Troopers while reading the Hive Mind of the Brain Bug in the finale– “It’s afraid!”Trump learned the lesson as old as time and first made famous by Machiavelli, then later made famous by Sonny from the Bronx Tale. As a leader– “Is it better to be loved or feared?” Ideally, it is better to be loved but it requires high social capital, someone following the “Queensbury Rules” of governance, etc. Democrats are a loose collection of aggrieved tribes, spiteful mutants and sociopaths. Trump attempted to be loved, it cost him dearly. So now he will be feared. And as Sonny explained, “If you have to choose, it is preferable to to be feared. Because fear lasts longer.”Like Africans, the Middle East, and other ahem “tribal” roots, the strong man that provokes fear is the only power they respect. He came first as the Lamb, he comes now as the Lion. Better late than never…

It really was always this simple, huh? Conservacucks spent years talking about shrinking the government with complicated tax plans, entitlement reforms, and things like this and never getting it done… While the right answer was always “just freeze the money lmao”

        Spot on analysis. What Trump is doing, or trying to do, at the Federal level needs to be done at every level of government, education and private business. Making the country work again – where we will lead tech, our planes fly without falling apart and fires are successfully fraught – will require major overhaul not just saner hiring practices.Most organizations of any type are no longer about what they were originally designed to do, they are just jobs programs and an opportunity for useless people to push pet agendas.The mess in LA with the fire is a great example. Forest management is no longer about preventing fires, it is about showing allegiance to Mother Gaia. The LA fire department is headed by strong independent lesbians named Kirsten with no real experience of fighting fires. The LA fire commission has no one on it with a background fighting or preventing fires. The head of the water department is a strong independent woman making 750k per year but with no strong track record of accomplishing good stuff so the fire fighters had cool trucks but no water.This plagues private industry too. Silicon Valley was once the promised land for white nerds. Now it is increasingly India West with the business side filled with strong independent women. Not surprisingly, China is pulling ahead of the US in most tech areas in spite of what Americans might think. In China they still get smart men together to tackle an issue. We used to do that but seldom do so anymore.

The country has tanked since the strong independent women took everything over.  The nation not only fails to use its most potent resource boys and men — it disenfranchises and demeans them, then crows about its morality and righteousness, and far-seeing wisdom.
The solution is obvious, but unpopular.  For now.

                MXGA = GWOOX. Make X great again means “get women out of X”. That’s the brutal truth no one wants to admit. As long as it’s getting done it’s not so important to say it out loud but doing so would encourage and empower those who’ve tried everything else.

                Women have proven to be far more adept at destroying than building. It used to be that the greatest source of untapped talent were working class and poor white males. Now middle class males have joined them.
Alas, white men are obsessed with making women happy more so than any other group of men on the planet. Women despise men who try hard to please them thus the destruction of white countries.

        This is all music to my ears. This is a major chunk of what some of us call “the deep state” — the part that is under water and is not as easy to discern as the visible part of the iceberg. Let me sing hosanas in praise of Trump.
On a side note, let me also comment that this time around Trump seems to be a quieter, more subdued, and more deliberate man. This is not the Trump of eight years ago.

                    Perhaps, but I’m charitable wrt Trump.  He’s learned that there are *no* friends in the swamp call Washington DC so he brought along his own friends.  Once he assembled his team, he was freed from 90% of the BS he attempted to navigate (make deals with) first term.  No more “mister nice guy” doe not equate (to me) as vindictive.  He simply has no need for what we term as “the swamp”.  He’s not a politician and suffering fools was never his claim to fame.  Quite the opposite.

            The Academy, especially the Ivy League and the Eastern government-prep private institutions, are another hyrda-head Trump must attack.
That’ll be a chore because much of intel and finance derive from there.  The venerable money, the Atlantic secret cliques, dug in as deep as the country is old.

                I agree, but as we saw with their response to the pro-Palestine protests, the threat of loss of funds has a huge impact on Ivies. No one is more aware of the deadweight there than the admins.

                FedGov could pretty much starve academia–including putatively private institutions–if it chose to. Disbanding federally subsidized student loan programs, alone, would be a torpedo amidships the USS Indoctrination.

                    Agreed.  But to put a finer point on it, the torpedo is not that students would no longer be subsidized, but that tuition inflation would no longer increase at twice the rate of inflation.  The subsidies do not help the student, but flow directly through to the college administrations.

                    This is the best way to attack the University Leftist monolith, starve it of students.  This will be difficult.  The loan system is interpreted as promoting higher education and its “golden ticket” to success in our economy.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Somehow that fact has to be accepted before radical change to the program will be accepted.It’s not just the national budget that’s at stake, it’s the very essence of the advanced educational system that’s at stake.  As standards decline to allow students of “average” intellect admission, the graduation of worthless, mediocre degree holders increases.  This is not the country’s benefit.

        There’s a part of me that hopes President Trump steps back from the Ukrainian conflict and says “F-that. It’s not an American problem so let the Europeans deal with it.”To which I would say “Bravo!” No US funding to Ukraine. No US weapons. Nothing.Our Eurocrats are the dumbest bunch of know nothings that have only mismanaged Europe to make it’s citizens poorer for decades. Always expecting America to provide ‘free’ security and solve all their military conflicts (Bosnia). But happily spending billions of tax payers Euros on failed social programs, exporting billions to various 3rd world countries while at the same time importing more and more social welfare recipients from abroad and ignoring their own citizens at home.Trump needs to treat Eurocrats like the spoiled children they are by simply ignoring them. Which may be exactly what he’s doing. If NATO countries don’t pay their agreed 5% by the end of 2025, then the US is out of NATO. Period. It’s no loss for the US and I fully respect the decision. There’s nothing President Trump needs to say he hasn’t already said before. There’s no need to fly over her just to repeat himself.NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte from the NL and President Alexander Stubb from Finland openly stated recently that Trump is right about NATO. He was right in his first administration and he’s still right today.No one in Europe imagines for a second that Putin will roll into western Europe. Russia is not our natural enemy and everyone including Putin else knows it. Putin wants nothing more than to recoup old Mother Russia and get on with doing business with the West. Unlike China, Russia is not an expansionist empire. Why American neocons can’t get that through their heads is beyond reason.If Russian Ukrainians in the Donbas want to break off from Ukraine and become another state of Russia as part of the conflict resolution, that would be perfectly fine with every European country that is currently housing, feeding and supporting Ukrainian refugees.Meanwhile Trump should keep doing what he’s been doing – taking care of Americans at home and putting America first.

            The US caused the conflict in Ukraine, so it would be nice if it ended it too. But stopping the flow of money and weapons to Ukraine would be better than nothing.

                Ukraine has been trying to join NATO since @2004. The Midget leader said he never intended to abide by the “Minsk Agreement”. My thought was, you need to learn to speak Russian. NATO in Ukraine has always been a hard red line for Russia, rightly so IMO. This war is on Ukraine. They stupidly allowed themselves to be used as a way for the MIC to make a little profit and launder some money.If the US said; “If NATO allows Ukraine to join, the United States will immediately withdraw from NATO” there would not likely be a war now.I don’t see the point of us being in NATO now. If there is a problem in the world we find unacceptable we could tell them as communication is instantaneous now.Not our problem; sort it out, would make a lot of problems go away.

                    Ukraine does not have the ability to act independently. To say that “this war is on Ukraine” is like blaming a child. Europe in general has very limited abilities to act independently, because all countries there are vassals of the US, though not as pathetic as the Ukraine.
US is a vassal of somebody else (Zelensky’s tribe), but we all know that.

                        Nonsense. Zelensky chose, of his own free will, to have hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians killed. That’s on him, no matter how much you might like to lay the blame elsewhere.
He accepted the houses, the villas, the cars, the bank accounts, etc., in exchange for setting all those people up to get killed. Don’t ignore his culpability. All he had to do is say, “No.” Vicky would have probably have had him killed, yes, but at least he would have died without having betrayed his countrymen.

            The European political class is in far worse shape than the American political class. The main reason is politics in Europe has evolved to reward those who are best at currying favor with Washington, especially through the various extranational entities. I suspect one reason the Trump admin has frozen out the EU ladies is to encourage national politicians to take the initiative.As far as Ukraine, the key to making a deal is the willingness to walk away from the deal entirely. This is fundamental. If there is no deal you want, then do not waste your time. Right now, I think Trump looks at Ukraine and does not see a deal he wants. He is happy to stir the pot to see if something floats to the top, but if not then he is fine with no deal.The one thing the Russians want when it is all done is recognition from the West of the final result. They want the signature on a piece of paper for the security framework that comes out of this. Trump may just put that in his pocket until he needs something from the Russians. Meanwhile, they can keep doing what they are doing in Ukraine.

                It sounds like the Russians want a complete overhaul to the security framework in Europe, not just a band aid for Ukraine. I doubt Trump and the EU are up for that.

            “American neocons”
(((American Neocons))) are not American in any sense other than paperwork.  They shouldn’t be here at all, let alone in government making their ancient ethnic enemies our enemies.  Russia ain’t the Soviet Union.  I have nothing against them. No American has any reason to hate or fear Russia.  Granted, they ain’t my people either, but not being my people is not a reason to hate them.  We should be closely allied with them along with the rest of Europe.

                I had a roommate during college years, a jewish female raised in SoCal. Like many at that age she was exploring her “roots”. We were chatting one day talking about our class loads. I mentioned one of my better courses was a Ancient Rome class and she lost her ever-lovin mind. Scree in Valley Girl accent.

                Russia *requires* (1) a demilitarized Ukraine; (2) a permanently neutral Ukraine (meaning permanently neutral *and* not in NATO); (3) a de-Nazified Ukraine; (4) a settlement of “the Odessa question” (and they *might* be willing to let that remain in the Ukraine…or maybe not; that might be negotiable, but I am only guessing; and (5) the *total* withdrawal of *all* NATO forces from Russia’s frontiers, *esp.* Finland and the three Baltic States but also Moldova/Moldavia; and this ignores the fact that Norway has a frontier with Russia. None of these requirements is negotiable. And sooner now rather than later, Russia will be in a position to dictate terms although–and again I am guessing–they might negotiate partially on 4 or 5 or both, depending on the military situation on the ground when/if negotiations can begin. This is going to be a tough nut to crack unless Trump can pull a hat out of this rabbit. And he *could* do that simply by standing aside and letting the Russians have what they require. Their requirements are entirely reasonable.

                WillS’s “If NATO allows Ukraine to join, the United States will immediately withdraw from NATO” is unilateral action, that is undoubtedly the best place for a Commander-in-Chief to start. Let the EU fund NATO.

        I hope that right now Trump administration people are pouring over and finding tangible records of egregious misdeeds.I thought that the top thing a Trump administration could do if it were dead serious would be to run its own media campaign from the White House that makes FDR’s old Fireside Chats seem small and disorganized.Imagine a White House podcast/webcast every night or every other night that detailed how this shadow government works. On the immigration bit you have the receipts of HIAS, Catholic and Lutheran charities and every ridiculous NGO on the payroll to fund and carry out not just an invastion of our country, but an ethnic war of colonial resettlement. I think this project would document this and show that this is exactly what this is.There would need to be a balancing act. How angry do you make the hornets? How cornered do you make these snakes? I do think such a campaign targeted at The Great Replacement would be eye opening. Even White shitlibs would have to take stock of what they have done. New York city schools only 15% White. LA schools only 20+-% White. Fort Worth is only 35% White. Show blacks their future as a minority crowded out by a much larger new plurality.I think this would be healthy and it would punch these guys in the teeth and do the one thing they fear most – be caught in the shadows with a gigantic spotlight on them. This would unleash a fury because the scale of the evil and the crime is that unprecedented.There was an impromptu press conference with Stephen Miller the other day. It was great because he kept these shitlib propagandists on a back parking lot and came out to meet them. One white traitor asked the classic leading question/propaganda statement and Miller did not take the bait. It was about ICE coming into a school. He outlined the epidemic of child trafficking, minor sexual assault, prostitution, drug dealing … … unleashed on American children – often their ethnic pets. When he was done the person filming the thing on their phone panned out to that womyn reporter. She looked stunned. I don’t know for sure, but she looked like a person who has been hit upside the head with the truth and consequence of what they have done. She was dazed.In any case, Trump has an extremely powerful tool at his disposal and an extremely ugly set of truths and facts that he could package and present to the American people on a regular basis. Were he to do that, post-America might have a chance at becoming New America. Time will tell. Someone very smart in his team has to have thought of this. Rolling something like this out would radically exacerbate The Regime’s legitimacy crisis and could cement Trump/Vance as the only legitimate reformers.

New America will be a non-white country unless there are mass deportations of American citizens. I don’t see how you do this without breaking the constitution but then maybe that’s the final threshold. I don’t think Trump has the inclination to do this,or the time, so then the question is who will?

Exactly, so it’s going to take more than 4 years and you  start to think about post-Trump. I mean, enjoy the present iconoclastic Trump and his adventures  but…
I don’t think JD Vance is the man to take things to the next level. He operates within the boundaries established by better men.

                            He also has an H1b wife.And what will the midterms bring? Trump is not very likely to deliver on his economic promises because that area is fraught with “land mines.” The Executive Branch does not hold the purse strings.  And the Congress is *not* going to stop spending, and the President does not have a line-item veto, although Trump, I believe, would not hesitate at this stage of the game to veto entire budgets since he is a lame duck now.And if he is truly serious about these tariffs, that will blow up in his face. The carrot of tax policy would avail FAR more than the stick of tariffs,soI fervently hope that tariff talk is just more of his trolling.

                                You are right, he cannot keep all his economic promises because they are contradictory. Booming stock market requires low interest rates, but that also causes more generalized inflation. And inflation will get worse that much faster the more they try to hold down rates.
The Fed just got too greedy. Had they contented themselves with being deca-millionaires, they could have done so without noticeable consumer inflation. But then Congress said, “Hold my beer.”
Agreed on tariff. Hope they are foreign policy sticks.

                                    Yes. He also cannot keep his mass deportation slow/stop immigration promises. He wants a booming economy which means more jobs and with data centers and energy that means construction and heavy industry.He’ll have to induce professionals to change careers to blue collar or he will have to force it through mass cuts to welfare and castle burning of the Dem patronage networks. That would be great. Will he do it? Will NGO attorneys and “journalists” go build data centers and operate LNG industry jobs?If they have no other choice yes. That would be ideal.I wouldn’t count on it. Thus, massive numbers of blue and white collar legal immigrants are coming to continue TGR.

It does not. But until a sufficient number of us understand that, the “only” answer is migrants.

                    True, but one thing that must happen is that steps must be taken to make sure whatever is done, cannot be undone by the left when they get back in.

Which means what, precisely,? The left does not care one whit about laws. It doesn’t care about the Constitution. Short of wood chippers, I don’t think there is anything you can do to stop the left from undoing things.

                The correct answer is “the people themselves/ourselves,” because you are right in what you say.
And this *must* happen–shall happen–most likely surrounding the 2032 election cycle, if only b/c so many normies still believe in voting. The way things are going, I’d not be surprised if it turned out to be the “blue” states that seceded.

        No more Mister Nice Guy. Trump-45 was too nice, too trusting – always willing to compromise. He was rewarded with insults, slander, massive disrespect, Special Prosecutors, two impeachments, bogus law-fare, and two close assassination attempts. They even called him another Hitler, not just once, but a million times. And yet by some miracle, he survived and returned to office.
Now Trump-47 gets his revenge. I hope it continues and accelerates for the next 4 years. The commies deserve it.

        The best indicator that Trump is well and truly pissed is to be found in Melania’s facial expressions. She looks like a Red Sparrow hiding 3 shivs and a mace under her skirt.

        “No one can say who banned normal light bulbs, for example, because the policy bubbled up from the network of extra-government entities of environmentalism.”
I thought this last night while listening to the new press secretary (who is a real pistol by the way) pointing out we were about to send $50 million worth of condoms to Gaza.  Who came up with this idea, and who approved it?  We will never know.

            …the new press secretary (who is a real pistol by the way).
She made my day when she answered the birthright citizenship question by confidently asserting that if an illegal immigrant gets into the country and has a baby here, that doesn’t subject the baby to U.S. jurisdiction. She’d have done better had she included *legal* immigrants as well, but, “baby steps,” no pun intended.
Trump should consider Riley Gaines to replace her in the event something or other causes her to resign before his term is up.

                    The laser-like focus on *illegal* immigrants when it comes to “birthright citizenship” is a huge mistake! Illegal immigrants are of course criminals, by definition, but we’re talking about “birthright citizenship” here, not the criminality of foreign and/or alien parents of American-born children belonging thereto. When Senator Howard (R MI) explained how section I of the fourteenth amendment would work and be applied going forward, when he introduced Section I to the full (39th) Congress, he explicitly *excluded* legal and illegal immigrant children alike, from qualification. …

            The official story Republican shills have been given is that the condom supply was anarms dealbetween Hamas and institutional American antisemitism.You see, the Palestinians use the goat-skin condoms we send them—you’d think for standard lefty NGO population control and buttsex-facilitation reasons, but no!—to float bombs into Israel. Surely you remember this happening.It is alarming that American Zionism and its conspiracy theories are becoming so strongly sex-themed. That’s how “antifascism,” now the state religion of the West, got its first real emotional foothold—in pornography. The fantasy of exploding pagers blowing off Arab testicles may have been a turning point.

        When I lived in Arlington, Virginia, two of my neighbors were grant writers. We didn’t talk shop much, but they noted that it was part skill in writing the grant requests and part networking. One worked for an environmental NGO, the other for some political NGO. Both did well.
I remember being a bit surprised to learn that the grants were from both the govt and private individuals/corporations/organizations. I just thought that these organizations were funded privately.

            What is the difference between a grant writer and the guy who begs for money at red lights? The latter seems like a more honest and honorable profession.Arlington, Virginia is a really nice place to live. The idea that somebody can live in a place like that solely because they are good at begging for money should be mind-blowing. The amount of grant requests the vast majority of people in the private sector have written in their lives is zero. It’s not a real skill. But if you say the right things and support the GAE regime, you too can be given this fake job and live a life of relative comfort. This is what needs to end.

                Related to this, it is only in recent decades (say post-1970) that the DC area has become the highest income metropolitan area in the US.  I recall looking at this post-2010 census, and the DC area boasted 13 of the 20 highest income counties in the US, and I suspect this has advanced further in the 2020 census.  This concentration of wealth around the Imperial Capital is a recent phenomenon, shifting wealth away from places that used to produce things (e.g., Detroit).Most of these wealth-siphoners around DC richly deserve to be re-educated through hard labor.  Deep down they know it too.

                I agree. I’m simply pointing out an anecdote showing how big an industry it is. I mean, two people out maybe ten neighbors in the grant writing business. That’s insane.
However, I would disagree that it’s not a real skill. There are good and bad grants writers – and those good grant writers brought in millions to their organizations. You and I can hate that all of it exists, but it was a skill – a skill used for evil but still a skill.

                Beggers have skillsets, too, and there is a hierarchy based on who knows the best way to capitalize on pity and fear. Grant applicants have a similar skillset, which in large part is knowing (a) what The Current Thing is and (b) how various agencies want to respond to The Current Thing. Academia led the way here, and note that even in the provinces the digs around colleges and universities are quite nice.

                    The Indians who work at scam call centers in New Delhi have a skill too. The question is if the juice is worth the squeeze.

It gets even worse too, now they take the community they just finished hollowing out and decided to fill it with Haitian migrants who eat your dog.

                I met a couple in their mid 30s in L.A., their business was setting people up in NGOs. They did dozens every year, since a nonprofit by law only need spend 3% of its money received on whatever cause or project it headlined.
They worked from home, from their $2.5 million dollar home(2007 prices)

            The hybrid public/private grant was the direct result of the Con, Inc.-ballyhooed “return to federalism” that began as far back as Nixon. It predictably became a way to avoid political scrutiny. The skillset basically is legalized fraud. Grant writing is the middleman writ large. The public funds, which always become the bulk, are syphoned off in the most creative ways imaginable.

                Sure, it was insane. But once it got started, it became a self-perpetuating machine. Politicians and bureaucrats authorized the funding and then went to work for those NGOs. Rinse and repeat.

                    The template was perfected in colleges and universities. Identification of (a) The Current Thing and (b) how government agencies and corporations wish to respond to The Current Thing can make it rain. My best mate currently is winding down a project to examine the impact of DEI on X Ivy and has been floating AI-related grant proposals for several years. He’s shameless and very successful and privately ridicules those who pony up the funding. Cynicism is quite helpful.

                Yep. Both grant writers had at least a master’s degree. Neither started as a grant writer. They got jobs out of college with an NGO doing whatever they studied but started to help out writing grants for their area. As those grants succeeded, the NGO started having them write more until it was a full-time job.Btw, neither worked for their original NGO. They were hired guns at that point, a valuable commodity. Also, it wasn’t just writing grants. They’d need to go to conferences or to various other organizations to suck up to donors or govt agencies, so they needed people skills as well.

                U of A is a top 20 research institution.  Basically that means that faculty are charged to produce grants rather than teach students—especially in the sciences.  The third leg of the triad is community service, but that is often an after thought or left to others who don’t write grants in the “soft” sciences.If you are a faculty member in the sciences, the goodies used in your research are obtained via government/private grants.  That includes your tenure if you are lucky enough to secure one of those slots.  The aspect of government grants as a source of university funding is huge.  Indeed, there are dept’s—chem comes to mind—that actually accept faculty that entirely support themselves on grant funds.  The faculty member receives a title, office/lab space, administrative support and the university/department gets a cut of the grants he writes.Big business.  When I left, the U of A, LPL, had just taken over the Mar’s Rover project.  This itself was estimated to be something like $100M over the course of the effort.  There are others like the Space Telescope and such.

                    Agreed. But the fact that they have that life of relative comfort and normalcy is a weakness. They can’t really fight a guy like Trump who comes in and uses his authority to shut down their gravy train. He’s already put them on the clock. They can’t wait until President Kamala comes in 2029 (lol). They can only go so long without being forced to do something else, and that time frame is a lot shorter than it may seem. Even if the gravy train gets set back up again, they have learned their position is far more precarious than they surely thought it was.As we have talked about, so much in the imperial capital runs on inertia. This is yet another one.

It’s ok to use “him” instead of the pretend-common-gender pronoun “them.” OK not just here; you should do it everywhere and always. We must reclaim our language and her proper grammar from the semi-literate Commie mobs.

        This ties into the green door post on AI. Thanks to technology, the oligarchs can now envision a world where they are not dependent on the managerial class to work their will, and thus do not have to share power with them. Bureaucrats will become as unnecessary as H1b coders or migrant farm workers.
The problem is, so will everybody else.

            Nah, it’s not that bad. AI is mostly going to take out the paper pushers and the middle managers. And, of course, grunt level coding. If you are one of those people who makes a difference, whether you are pulling wires or producing vision, you are good. If you make a living at a keyboard, you need to take a step back and honestly answer whether your position is safe.

                I’ve been reading about AI since I was a teenager in the 80s.  Great AI was always just around the corner.We have a bunch of examples of AI “hallucinating” and just making shit up.  ChatGPT routinely just makes stuff up whole-cloth.  It has invented fake citations in court cases.  Like “See Grimms V Smith” and the case simply does not exist anywhere.  Keith Ellison, the AG of Minnesota just filed a suit about how ChatGPT does this and irony of all ironies, parts of the suit was generated using ChatGPT (blacks never cease to amaze)!  They’ve all been programmed to be shitlibs and that includes Chinese AIs.  Not only are they shitlibs, they’re communists.It’s good for some things, but I don’t think we are in that much danger at least for right now.

                AI is a tool, not a crutch.  My greatest fear at this time is that those people it replaces will be replaced with people of less understanding of the job and greater reliance on the AI provided them.  This may work wonderfully —until it fails spectacularly!

                I’ve noticed two new bits of conventional business wisdom emerge lately: White men are too “emotional” to trust with employment, and no one is less valuable than an “ideas guy,” i.e., a saboteur.Maybe thesefactshave been invented to harden the present arrangement against reform. That story is easy to make up. The case for “AI” refutes the case for infinite jeets, but they’re still needed to replace white workers, who are thisdual hazardof entitlement, etc.But I think it’s worse than that. Boiled to its essence, the emerging job of “AI” is to take the place of human judgment. So it’s the people capable of judgment, people whovalueit, who are being removed/repressed make room for it.You may be called upon—your true vocation!—to twist two wires together, white man, but you can’tdecideto do it.

                    “…no one is less valuable than an “ideas guy,” i.e., a saboteur.”The first is true, but definitely not the latter. Apple would probably have died out without Steve Jobs. And the corporate culture, supporting Steve, prevented saboteurs from dominating the direction of Apple.“Boiled to its essence, the emerging job of “AI” is to take the place of human judgment.”Yeah, well not in my lifetime. Likely not in my kids’ lifetime. AI can’t do anything more than respond with what it’s programmed to say. Which is why entry level coding and middle managers and bureaucrats are easy to replace with AI — given any situation, it’s easy to figure out what their response should be.Human judgement in general? Sci Fi, for quite a while into the future.

        I am beginning to wonder if there is any presidential act that can’t be delayed or countermanded by some random judge. From whence came this power? Why is it recognized?I remember approving of the last Trump admin’s actions at the outset, before it was brought to heel within a few weeks or months. By about May 2017 it no longer was the Trump administration, for practical purposes. I recognize that it’s a better start this time, I’m not all negativity. At the rate we’re going, it will only take another month, tops, before the opposition’s heads just explode, or else they begin an overt secession movement. Either is a welcome development. Yesterday on the front page of reddit there was a big thread about California seceding. As ever, they are what they claimed we were.

Trump just needs to take a page from Bidet’s playbook. Basically ignore the court by issuing the same proclamation, but with a few different words. There’s a real task for AI — prepare 100 different variations on the same deportation order, then have his staff review them and issue them as fast as the previous one is enjoined.

                        In this particular case that doesn’t help. Because it’s the grant writers who have the choice of obeying the president or obeying the court, and if they choose to follow the court, the president has no recourse. Unless he comes up with a new, never before seen way to fire bureaucrats.

            “From whence came this power?”
From the Marbury v. Madison decision of 1803.
“Why is it recognized?”
B/c our legal system is based on precedent. Why the staunchly anti-federalist President Jefferson acquiesced in that ruling I do.not.know.

            The entire concept of an impartial judiciary is broken.
People are not stoic meat-bots. The Vulcan race is a Star Trek fantasy.
The only humans even close to that ideal are benevolent male despots with so much money, power, and women that they are essentially impossible to influence via those vectors.

        Z, your writing just keep getting better.  My concern in your latest piece is not that Trump is on the right track, he is, but that the work in front of him is vast.  It has taken decades for this sprawling octopus of agencies to embed, and it will take years to weaken and dismantle it.  He only has four.  But this is not enough, doing the job right requires a systemic change that makes its regrowth less likely. Perhaps Vance can continue the good work.  Let’s hope so.

        The most surprising aspect of all this has been the revelation that the oppressive state apparatus is not nearly as securely entrenched as thought, and relatively few individuals have been responsible for most of the severe corruption. Apparently this made it far easier to identify the sources of the cancer and where to apply radiation first. Yes, there has been a tremendous, nay, shocking amount of planning and thought put into what needs to be done, but it also is obvious that Oz had a glass jaw visible to those who counted.Closely related, elected officials have retained much more power than I once thought. It seemed almost all had been ceded to the administrative state, and while that was the case to a large extent, it wasn’t nearly to the total degree I thought. Crow is on the menu.While I find Curtis Yarvin ludicrous, his suggestion to pay off the miscreants to go away was rock solid and those dismantling these systems seemingly realized it. Initially the hardest hit will be Northern Virginia property developers, but over time Leviathan itself may be cut down to size. I’m not a believer that the crisis for whites is politically soluble, but this has been totally unexpected and a complete surprise. Very tempered optimism is in order and however things are resolved this is a move in the right direction for what comes next.

        Cogent assessment.
The Hydra’s moolah freeze gives the Trump admin breathing space to analyze the enemy from an adjacent position, prior to the next strike.  Get them worried and skeered, bleating to one another on the phone, then signal the artillery.
Chief difference from 2017 is aggressiveness.  He is attacking this time.  Last time he was a metal duck at one of those carnival booths.

        The courts have already stayed at least some of his freeze on funding.  The question now is will Trump do as the Democrats always do?  They always say, ok we will obey the court but then they continue on as they did before and ignore the courts.

                Income tax is the steady income stream the federal government uses as an asset to justify the creation and financing of infinite debt.
In industry, you see something similar on a smaller scale when a private equity firm buys up say, utility companies as their form of steady income to justify their ridiculous debt issuances.

                    Exactly,exactly,and many thanks, Geese.What is missed is, I think the term is Net Present Value– that is theanticipatedyield used to price the asset today.
That steady anchor is used as collateral for debt, which is how bonds work. That, and, as Micheal Hudson points out, income tax was invented specifically to cover war loans.
War loans used to be a bet on a king winning; if he died or lost, the bet was lost. Once repayment was pinned on the citizenry, it didn’t matter…in fact, it incentivized war loans to both sides.

        Regards Ukraine that appears, at least to me, a very dangerous situation for Trump.  He needs to stay as far away from that as he can but that may become impossible.  The Russians are never going to accept what has been put on the table by NATO and the U.S.The art of the deal won’t work when you have no bluffs left and the other side is winning spectacularly.    However the neocons and Zelensky are always capable of mounting a huge false flag event.    Trump likes to win.

                    You bet. When Putin learned of the extent of those labs on his border, he launched the SMO. This was right at the end of the Plandemic, which brought them into the highlight.
p.s.- the target ACE2 receptors in the cell are present most highly in Caucasian and Asian populations, so yer darn tootin’ the Slavs and Chinese freaked right out (while developing their own non-mRNA ‘vaccines’ against an undefined threat.  It’s like trying to pin down next year’s flu vaccine.)

                    I have no idea whether Trump is savvy enough, but certainly some of his people are. The US has no interest in Europe. If he is really interested in America First, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with letting Putin take the bio-weapons bit in his teeth and give him free rein. Worst case, it comes back to bite the neocons, globalists and CIA.
Sounds like a win to me.

Maybe trot out old Obama the Lightbringer and have him start talking up his “leading from behind” then a rout, a-la Bidenspeak in Afghanistan, can become a “victory for the ages” and we can all make a omelette, even if it takes ‘cracking a few eggs’ being sure to note them thar orbs do not come cheap these days.

        “Trump has answered some questions about the Ukraine war…”Not sure if others have picked this up while listening to Trump’s comments on the Russian-Ukraine conflict, but Trumps knowledge is 180 degrees off base.  Whatever Trump claims to know, he is being misinformed—profoundly.  His musings are little better than what we heard from the Biden folk since 2022.The commentators we often cite here, Ritter, McGregor, Johnson, etc have even commented upon the misinformation Trump spouts in interviews.  There is no way one can begin peace talks with such a misimpression to the ground situation and Russia’s ability and intent to continue the war.  Under estimating your enemy, in this case Putin, can be fatal.

            Trump has said some positively wacky things. My hunch is he is doing a version of shit poasting to see what sort of reaction he gets from the various players. Right now, there are no good options for him in Ukraine, so stir the pot and see if something interesting rises to the top.
I also suspect Trump would like to put off talks with Putin. There is little to be gained from a meeting right now, so put it off until when there is something to be gained. A little crazy talk buys some time.

The best option IMO is cut off all funding. Then monitor, forget this promise of ‘ending the war’ in five minutes. In fact, all foreign wars can be conducted minus our funding. The MIC can focus on their new AI-enabled machine-gun armed drone dogs to patrol the US borders like a junkyard dog inside the chain link fence keeps the parts ON the stacked cars within.

            Trump needs to somehow determine what the minimum Putin will accept is.  This is difficult with all of the neocons telling him lies.   I would imagine it is something along the lines of:  Guaranteed no NATO in Ukraine ever.  Not sure how to get that done.   Russian occupation to the Dnieper (buffer zone)  and formal recognition of the four new Russian Regions.It will probably also require Russian military inspections of all shipping into Ukraine at land ports and sea ports.  This if Ukraine wants to keep their Odessa Port.   Maybe some sanctions relief and the return of the Russian funds in the West that have been seized.Then Trump declares victory and says he has saved most of Ukraine.

        I’ve been calling for – and predicting this – for months. Years, really. The name I gave it in 2017 was Operation: Decapitation. You can’t run a #resistance without Generals and without Money.Fire (or reassign) the Generals and target the money. I think I even wrote here a month or two ago that Trump would need to target the money flowing into the illegal immigration NGOs and then subject them to legal scrutiny (audits). When they lawyer up and start filing lawsuits…start targeting their lawyers…and then bleed them dry of cash filing expense lawsuits.It is absolutely correct that Trump is targeting the core of the #resistance in the shadow government. But that is just the first of several phases. Notice that targeting of the ACTUAL government (USAID firings) ramped up once his cabinet picks were approved. Hegseth hasn’t even gotten started yet. But Rubio immediately went to work removing heads.Hence the full-on hysteria about Hegseth, and now RFK Jr. today, and Tulsi/Kash later this week. The Senators and permanent government now see what is happening, and they can see what these cabinet picks are being ordered to do. And those cabinet picks are DOING IT.  Their resistance to this is limited to screaming at nominees which only increases voter angst about the Senators and improves Trump’s polling.  The Republicans in particular are in a real pickle.  They simply cannot be seen rejecting Trump after his landslide win.As it turns out, these nominees aren’t just going to be Trump’s MAGA warriors. The hysteria over their nominations distracted people from the hundreds of executive orders. Sure, Trump might lose a few of those in court, maybe even retract some. But that’s like bugs hitting the windshield at 80mph. Yeah, it’s messy, but we’re going to make it to the game on time.
