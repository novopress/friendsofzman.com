        The Republicans are the Whigs, and this is 1855.  Seriously.  It‚Äôs a facile comparison, but it‚Äôs true for all that.  Back in 1855, you had four options: Rabidly proslavery, moderately proslavery, silently proslavery, and other.  The Whigs were ‚Äúother.‚Äù  Back in the days they‚Äôd been the heirs to the Federalists, but programs of internal improvements and tweaks to the banking system just didn‚Äôt turn America‚Äôs crank anymore when there was a huge, looming, cataclysmic issue at hand that the entire political class resolutely refused to talk about.  And so, by 1852, both parties were reduced to running on whose candidate looked spiffier in a Mexican War uniform, and by 1856 the Whig Party was gone.  The good news: They were replaced by the Republicans, who really did have a radical new program to offer.  The bad news: 1856, the election in which the Whigs disappeared, went to an utterly atrocious Democrat who had no business in politics, James Buchanan, because nobody was ready to roll the dice yet on political upheaval.  The worse news: The next election was 1860, and some unpleasantness followed.  Now, I‚Äôm not saying Hillary isdefinitelyJames Buchanan ‚Äî so far as I know, Buchanan never sold state secrets to our enemies for slush fund cash ‚Äî but I‚Äôm saying that, if Buchanan had had his own email server‚Ä¶.Buy ammo, is what I‚Äôm saying.  Interesting times ahead.

            If only this were 1856. Women did not vote, nor blacks, and ballots were not printed in two languages.  No one on government assistance voted because there wasn‚Äôt any. Actual issues were discussed without restraint, well and badly, while universal suffrage is a progressive machine and nothing but. Discussion is limited to blogs, and perhaps even there not for long. Trump, an opportunistic  crony capitalist Democrat, threw two bombs and we cheered, because that is what we are reduced to.We act as though the Republican Party has betrayed something when that something has not existed since 1865. The Pledge of Allegiance itself  is a betrayal of everything before 1861 and we think of it as a conservative oath. We‚Äôre fucked, trapped in 150 years of accumulated myths. That whole republic thingy tries men‚Äôs souls. This way is easier, all you have to do is lessen your grip and relax the anus.

                No analogy is perfect, alas.  üôÇ  But again, look at your complaint.  It‚Äôs very similar to the plight of the ‚Äúothers‚Äù in 1856 ‚Äî national politics was run by slaveholders, for slaveholders, despite the fact that only a tiny minorityof Southernersowned slaves and the majority of the nation as a whole was at least mildly bothered by slavery.  Certainly a whole bunch of people felt ‚Äúreduced to cheering‚Äù when the Whigs won a few seats, or occasionally the Presidency (though when they did, their candidate wasalsoa slaveholder).  This has all happened before.

                    Universal suffrage rules the field. Progressives have mastered it and control media, academia, and permanent government. It is in the Progressive nature to touch everything, when the conservative nature is to leave them alone. The fight is not only unequal, it is non-existent. If liberty were to be reintroduced to politics, it will not be incrementally.Tocqueville‚ÄìI am of the opinion that, in the democratic ages which are opening upon us, individual independence and local liberties will ever be the products of art; that centralization will be the natural government. The pleasure it procures them of interfering with everyone and holding everything in their hands atones to them for its dangers.Not only is a democratic people led by its own taste to centralize its government, but the passions of all the men by whom it is governed constantly urge it in the same direction. It may easily be foreseen that almost all the able and ambitious members of a democratic community will labor unceasingly to extend the powers of government, because they all hope at some time or other to wield those powers themselves. It would be a waste of time to attempt to prove to them that extreme centralization may be injurious to the state, since they are centralizing it for their own benefit. Among the public men of democracies, there are hardly any but men of great disinterestedness or extreme mediocrity who seek to oppose the centralization of government; the former are scarce, the latter powerless.

                ‚ÄúTrump, an opportunistic crony capitalist Democrat, threw two bombs and we cheered, because that is what we are reduced to.‚ÄùOpportunist? Hardly. Opportunists hang around, looking for favorable circumstances and a lucky break that they can take advantage of. Trump has crowbarred his way into this race, fighting the media, the GOP establishment, and the democrats. Absolutely nobody is on his side, except the voters. Just because Trump makes it look easy, doesn‚Äôt mean it is. He is swimming against a fiercer tide than any presidential politician since Reagan‚Äôs first run in 1976.Crony Capitalist? Well, if he is, he‚Äôs the first crony capitalist without any cronies. The New York City establishment has despised him since the 1980s‚Äì that ‚Äúshort-fingered vulgarian‚Äù stuff goes back 30 years when Spy Magazine, the favorite read of the 80s Smart Set, used him as their go-to punching bag.Democrat? How would you know? He has never been involved in politics at any level until this year. As a New York City developer, I‚Äôm sure he donated to, and associated with, plenty of Democrats; how else would you do business in that town? As far as his relationship with Hillary and Bill‚Äì hell, staying close to those two is just common sense if you were in his position; ‚Äúkeep your friends close, and your enemies closer‚Äù as someone once said.

        The intellectual heavyweights that the Republican Party may have had recently, like Ron Paul, have been pushed out. Thing is that Republican Party accepted the New Deal, Social Security, Big Government, Big War Machine, Big Subsidies, Big Bailouts, Big Secret Treasury Looting, and they have no positive intellectual message left with which to battle socialism and Keynesians (talk about voodoo economics!).The smart ones, the genuine ones, are at minimum libertarians, and Austrian economists. The free market dynamics are the best weapon against poverty, and libertarian principles (the non-aggression principle, or voluntarist action) the minimum common denominator, minimum requirement for a society at peace.That means the Christian thinkers who get Biblical instruction instead of war worship and Muslim and cult bashing. You‚Äôd think the Great Commission would result in missionaries infiltrating Arabia with Bibles and fellowship with secret churches in Arabia instead of  joining the Army to kill them.

        Your way too optimistic about the Vichy Republicans.   Look at their ratings and over a third of the Vichy GOP are really conservative Democrats.   Another half are the dreaded moderates, with no principles or beliefs.   Only a small number can be called conservatives.   The one hope is that the mask has come of the dhimmies.   They are Marxists pure and simle.   Unless you are a social outcast, a loser, a government employee or a member of the leech class there is no reason one would vote for a dhimmirat.

        The framers of the Constitution never envisioned that a member of Congress would not have a real job; e.g., self employed or having some other private sector job. They envisioned individuals in government as having temporary roles there and then resuming their ‚Äúreal‚Äù jobs (not in government).There really needs to be term limits for members of Congress ‚Äì for starters. But nothing will change until the money spigot to DC is shut off permanently. Repeal of the 16th Amendment (ratified in 1913) ‚Äì implementation of the personal and corporate income tax ‚Äì  would be a good start.Less money tossed at the crooks in DC would greatly help diminish their power and influence.Also repeal of 17th Amendment to the Constitution (enacted 1913) would restore the election of US Senators to Congress as a responsibility of each of the STATE legislatures. This action would once again provide incentive for the US Senators to be responsive to their respective states and hopefully decrease the power of our tyrannical, repressive, unconstitutional govt. of, by and for the ruling bureaucracy.Not that long ago a US Senatorial candidate from Kentucky? Tennessee? West Virginia? held a fund raising event for left wing millionaires in MANHATTAN !!! Give me a break. These upper west side commies would join the Nazi party before they ever stepped foot in the the state this Senatorial hopeful wished to represent in the US Congress.Direct elections of US Senators by their  state legislatures would help reduce this affront to democracy.I do not mean to come off as a snob or elitist, but many voters have zero clue about economics, history or political issues; they simply do not bother to look into things with any depth.  If they did, Bernie Sanders (a communist) and Hillary Clinton (a criminal, cheat and liar and married to a serial rapist) would have ZERO support amongst the electorate and not be bamboozled by the propaganda arm of the democratic/socialist/communist party ‚Äì the mainstream media.The worthless, incompetent, bumbling, negligent republicans do zero other then bend over for the democrats. They are useless. Cruz (and Rand Paul) exposed this scam which is why they are/were Public Enemy Number 1 and 2 for the republican (i.e., democratic party ass kissers) party elites. (And the elites are shocked !! shocked !! that a loose cannon like Trump is popular ).Returning power to the states will produce winning and losing states; but it will force many states ‚Äì if cut off from federal largess if federal income taxes are eliminated or drastically reduced- to either become economically viable or literally die, as they COMPETE with other states to raise the economic fortunes of their citizens. And it will at least provide the opportunity for denizens of dying states to move to growing and economically friendlier states.Yes, folks can do that now (witness the flow out of NY, NJ to the SE USA, etc. ) , but the millstones  of federal taxation and federal repression are ubiquitous across the USA.Do not forget that a very large portion of federal tax dollars goes to pay the welfare benefits of the hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens that California (and other states) INVITE into their states. They can do this because the federal govt (US taxpayers) shoulder a very large portion of these costs. I seriously doubt California and other states would maintain these policies if their own taxpayers ‚Äì and ONLY their own taxpayers ‚Äì were on the hook for the costs of providing the living/food/clothing/welfare benefits for these illegals.

            Interesting that America‚Äôs founding fathers were expected to work.
Here in the UK parliament essentially ran from about six at night to just before midnight, simply because MPs were expected to have jobs outside the Palace of Westminster. It is only in fairly recent times that the House has come to be seen as a sort of club for people who have no clue about what work is and thus no idea of what ordinary people do. It‚Äôs a fair bet that members of the risible ‚ÄòEuropean Parliament‚Äô in Brussels have much the same outlook.

        I discovered your website about 6 months ago ‚Äì and I found that many of your insights (a) caused me to think differently  about some issues, and (b) were in agreement with my own read on the same issues.Having said that, your opinions are diminished by your failure to use appropriate grammar ‚Äì it‚Äôs not hard, as I‚Äôm sure you know from your intelligent analyses ‚Äì I taught in a Title I school in D.C.; I learned basic grammar and spelling from my public school teachers on Long Island in the terrible 50‚Äôs; is it so hard to try to get the spelling and grammar right? Unfortunately, to me, it represents a laziness that isn‚Äôt reflected in the quality of your thinking.Keep up the great analyses!

                On balance, I would rather read something decent and thought-provoking, albeit with the odd typo, than something perfectly presented but intellectually void.

                    My view is that this is the most casual of platforms. That means I get to be creative with my sentence and paragraph structure in order to keep it conversational in tone. If I‚Äôm writing a user manual for a shop vac, then I use a style and tone appropriate for that. Spelling/typos are just a part of it. I catch what I can in the first re-read and anything that jumps out afterward. It‚Äôs a blog, not a manuscript.One of things you notice reading comments is that there is a segment of the population that is unraveled by spelling and grammar. They are like the people that have to wash their hands every hour or alphabetize their canned goods in the cupboard. They don‚Äôt read and comment for enjoyment. They read and comment to correct spelling and grammar. It‚Äôs a form of madness.
