        Oh, FFS, people, own up to your own culpability.
Stop buying Chinese shit, they stop making it.
Stop buying Amazon, buy from your local mom&amp;pops, and the Amazon vans stop rolling.
This whole shitshow is people catering to the choices you and your neighbors make.

        I don’t know if there needs be a draft to round up the fleeing White men; I wonder if, instead, squatting will be normalized as was rainbow teachers, tranny rights, or criminal release.  Dispossession is dispossession, and dispossession is conquest.

            Your words make me want to fight, as futile as that fight may be under our current situation.  Good Lord, what will I do?
You don’t want to waste your big burst.  Charging the machine gun turrets and all in a frenzy of futility…

            Squatting mostly affects wealthy people with &gt;1 home they visit infrequently.  The practice will be quickly ended because it affects the wrong people.
Somewhere deep in the bowels of government, someone is looking for a way to force Americans to house illegals.  No doubt somebody in said government has made the argument that the Constitution only prohibits quartering troops, not illegals.
We are being ethnically cleansed, though.  Can’t protest, that’s a crime now, for example.  Even when they blatantly steal an election…

                It’s not that complicated. Congress passes a law saying you’re required to house illegals (or whomever), president signs it, and it’s law. As you say, it’s not unconstitutional.

                It probably will be done via taxation prior to outright confiscation. Biden is proposng upping the capital gains tax to roughly 50 percent for those who earn a million. OK, yawn. But that is just the opening shot. Quartering as the new home mortgage interest deduction?

        Our troubles are mostly due to the chosen.  Sure, there are other factors, like greed for cheap labor and personal corruption, but the chosen are the most consequential factor.  We must address this.After that, white Nationalism, where Christians and non-Christians separate and pledge to mutual self-defense.  The government should incentivize traditional sex roles and monogamy.  If some lady is gifted in a masculine way, like Leni Riefenstahl or Amelia Earhart, then let her do her thing, but treat her as an exception and don’t glorify her.We must be willing to nullify the obnoxious exceptions, especially homo men.The economy should be assembled to provide the jobs that are most satisfying to our people.  Few people like to work, but if manufacturing jobs are more satisfying to most of our men, then set up the economy to provide those jobs.  The nerds and the elite will construct tech jobs as a complement.  But the Death Penalty for finance jobs.It’s probably best to outlaw most of the stock market except futures for businesses that produce something in uncertain seasonal conditions.If not something like this, then we’re probably going to fail.

            Finance has its place, but finances supposed to facilitate the workings of the economy. Finances become the tail wagging the dog. The incentives that are making that happen need to be changed.I pretty much agree with everything you wrote except for the part about homo males. I agree with not glorifying the activity or encouraging it, but at the same time, we all have a limited time on earth. We shouldn’t go out of our way to make anybody fly miserable we don’t have to. I wouldn’t be so hard on them, I was just make sure we make our kids understand that it’s an undesirable behavior.

                That is a pretty bad Google translation/autocorrect. Let me try again:Finance has its place, but finance is supposed to facilitate the workings of the economy.

                    TempoNick:  Meanwhile, they make everyone else miserable with their antics and demands.  They are not naturally happy people, and need attention and admiration from normal people to reassure themselves that they are special.
Your pious ‘tolerance’ is what got us into this mess in the first  place.

                        I’m not at all a tolerant person. I’m just somebody who doesn’t care. Abort to your heart’s content, have butt sex to get your heart’s content. No to get off my nose and I’m not going to let politics get me in a lather over it.
I’m also not for making people’s lives miserable unnecessarily. There have always been homos, nothing you can do about it other than strongly discouraging it. I think our society is a little more advanced than the ones who throw them off of buildings, don’t you? Shouldn’t you have some humanity toward your fellow man?

                        @Nick, I was more or less with you right up until the last couple sentences.
No, you cannot “tolerate” any amount of evil. I’m not saying drag them out of their homes and string them up, but I am saying you can refuse to sell them jack. If they choose to respond by moving back to the blue hives that spawned them, fine.

You discriminated against men in that part, and I downvoted the entire comment, which I’d’ve up voted without that lack of equity re the two sexes.

            Don’t have a problem so much with the stock market per se; it is the insider trading, scams, and bailouts (aka corruption) that cause most the issues.  In particular, Congresscritters’ immunity from insider trading prohibitions.

        Since my other comment got eaten, we know several things.1. The Regime through State/CIA affiliated NGOs spent a lot of money (and in the Ukraine bill will spend billions more) recruiting out of Latin American and West African prisons the worst of the worst military age men to immavade the US and funded their every step. Why? Manpower obviously but for what?2. The Regime has gone all in on Transgender in girls locker rooms through the WH Title IX declaration. Even the most lunatic woke Cool Wine Mom does not want her middle school daughter molested by weirdos in a dress in the locker room or bathroom.3. Trump’s conviction and jailing (and Epsteining) is a slam dunk by late June at the latest complete. The Supremes have been told by that Admirals/Generals amicus curae brief to not intervene or “else.”4. Ukraine’s ability to raise men is pretty much over and their front is collapsing, so too is NATOs ability to send munitions including the US very limited. Pretty much all stocks are out and the $$$ cannot magic up dead men or magic up new factories with new workers to build munitions.5. The US is sending “less than 60” advisors and France, Germany, and Poland have sent thousands of troops while Macron urges Europe “not to be cowards” and institute a draft to send (their White men only) to die at the Russian Front. A former UK Defense minister has called for a NATO-wide draft including older White men for defense work.6. The real power behind the throne is the Intel Agencies, and Big Army, the Navy and Air Force lost out post-Reagan and the pattern until recently has been Intel color revolutions and occasionally Big Army beat-downs of tomato cans. To keep budgets up, “peace dividends” away, and avoid anything but continual growth for their families and friends.7. For some reason I can’t figure, the Intel Agencies and Big Army seem intent on fighting a BIG WAR in Ukraine against Russia. First with whatever we can scrape together with the Regular Army, and then with a Draft.8. The Draft will be like Ukraine. Those “migrants” will be the manpower to snatch up White men and send them to the Russian front. Bonus: eliminate YT. That at least seems the plan from Intel and Big Army.

            Replying to my own comment, the complication is that domestic elements are moving to defenestrate ((())) out of the Ivies, again. And eventually (since they feed into there), Wall Street. That is a direct threat to the dynastic interest of (((Wall Street))). Ilhan Omar wants her kid as the big shot, not Larry Fink’s. Simple as that. [FT reports that Larry Fink is spending half a million a month of Blackrock money on security].The Dynastic interests, the most powerful, may just have the Wall Street (a money laundering operation for Intel) work with its faction to replace Brandon with Trump as long as Trump plays along. The Dynastic interests have the money, but the Black/Brown people at Columbia, Harvard, Yale etc. have the people, manpower, and power advantage (Obama, Jarrett, Holder, Oprah, etc) over ((())).THAT is the complicating factor. The inevitable splintering of the Coalition of the Ascendant as White dudes recede like Elves leaving Middle Earth.

                    Probably most of them. And the damage will not easily be rectified. The game the Intel people were playing with assassinations in Moscow of Darinya Dugina, the mil-blogger, and Crocus City Hall attacks not to mention numerous Black Sea attacks on Russian shipping was not going unanswered.Note too we have about 1,000 service men and women in Niger being held hostage along with those at the Embassy, and Djibouti is about one big riot from over-running our base there as the people and government have sided with Yemen (and yes China has a big base there also).Things can go very south, very quickly on both fronts. Hostage videos, dead military personnel, Africans dragging dead bodies around on video, it would Mogadishu / Black Hawk Down times ten. And we have two enemies with means, motive, and opportunity to make that happen now.

        If the Russians can undertake offensive operations like you are saying, then its even worse for the West because the Russians retain the initiative.  Every day without a negotiated settlement hurts Ukraine and the West more that the Russians.The Western Progressive Elite is so used to pushing around their own people and never giving an inch that they can’t conceive of actually negotiating in good faith to achieve the least worse result.It might have been an undesireable outcome to give Russia what it was asking for three years ago.  But now Russia will get what it was asking for at a tremendous cost of Western blood, treasure and prestige.  Sure the Russians have paid a price, but that is a reckless and foolish way to conduct affairs.

            I’ve been toying with the idea lately that what we are seeing in foreign relations is the same behavior that you see in hardball business tactics. You can vanquish another business, but it’s hard to keep millions of people down for long. I hesitate blaming the Jews for everything, but I do wonder if the Jews have too much of a hand in foreign policy and whether we witness the same behavior we witness from them in business.And the other thing is that the American propaganda we grew up with about being the shining city on the hill. That’s over. They’ve turned too many people who swallowed the Kool-Aid like me into cynics. This country will never be the same.

russia didn’t have blacks on plantations and they defeated the nazis.
So it’s hard to call them racists and nazis and make it stick.

                Reasons why liberal-globalist Jews hate Russia and why Jews provoked a war between the West and Russia:1. for the same reason why they are getting into conflict with China, and why they go after any self-determining local government – because it is not part of the GAE and therefore not under their Jewish control2. for Putin taking Russia back from Jews, ending Yeltsin-era complete massive financial and natural resources rape by the indigenous Jewish ex-Soviet oligarch financial pirates and by Bill Browder, Larry Summers, and other Jewish Western financial pirates.  Jews constantly make it plain that they hate Putin and want regime change in Russia – i.e. they want full ability to own and exploit Russia’s massive natural resources again.3. for stopping Israel’s planned destruction of Assad and Syria, and for being in alliance with Israel’s enemy Iran4. because Russia has banned homosexual propaganda and activism, which is one of liberal Jews’ very most favorite things5. for Stalin taking Russia back from Jews, putting an end to the reign of terror of the fanatical Jewish original Bolsheviks (by, of course, unfortunately, starting his own reign of terror)6. for centuries of lethal ancestral Tsarist-era Jewish/Slavic ethnic conflict

                    Turkey, for instance, officially frowns on Palestine, yet Turks still do roaring business supplying Israel with concrete and oil transhipments.  Turkey still depends on reliable IMF loans.  Turkey still gets a piece of Syria’s oil and grain.Ukraine isstill getting paidby Russia for the gas pipelines.  The Eurodollar system is still held hostage by the West, on top of $325 billion of Russia’s money.  That’s a lot of rubles after conversion, for a country smaller in population than Mexico.This sort of double-dealing goes on in every country.It’s just hard price negotiation.  Rulers have to accept tradeoffs, because not one of them holds all the cards.Do you think Blackrock doesn’t already have a favored general in place, as a sword over Zelensky’s head?  Blackrock is now the primary dealer for the Federal Reserve, just as the Rothschilds saved the Bank of England’s bacon a time or two.  The ability to make a potential deal has its own price, the value of a card not yet shown.

                Agreed.  Which highlights the ludicrousness of the media’s allegations that Russia was hell-bent on taking Kiev.
“OMG, the Russians are gonna slaughter ‘Krainian peeps in the Keev!” was the refrain for nye on four months.
Hogwash!
WTH would Russia do with a combative, indigent city of millions?  Really?  In today’s media environment?
Of course, taking “Keev” was never a Russian priority, and so, our ‘mainstream’ media has lied to us again!
Anything it takes to get its war.

        I read all the comments up to this post (129). I take it as a given that Russia doesn’t care what happens in the US elections. Therefore, they are just going to continue doing what they are doing. Sometime this summer they are going to achieve their goals in the Ukraine. Any negotiations are off the table, as top Russian officials have already stated.What happens in the US elections is anyone’s guess. Who knows who will be sworn in in January. It may be Trump, Biden, or some wild card. The intel blob is preparing for any eventuality. They are going to continue doing what they do until they are stopped. The liberties of Americans will continue to be threatened until something breaks in the increasing chaos and then, probably in late 2024 or next year, “there will be weeks when decades happen.” Then and only then will the grillers wake up and panic breaks out. Start preparing now.Addendum: Just my pet thesis, but the intelligence and surveillance blob is almost certainly preparing for an accelerating storm of deaths from the Covid “vaccines,” which will cause the economy to crumble before our eyes. Also, the ATF and the rest of the security apparatus is proposing new regulations at this very moment. Again, make your plans accordingly.

            I doubt the intel blob is preparing for any eventuality. More likely, they have already decided (or been informed of) what the eventuality will be, and they are preparing for that specifically.

            “The liberties of Americans will continue to be threatened until something breaks in the increasing chaos and then, probably in late 2024 or next year, “there will be weeks when decades happen.”The problem with this thinking is the idea that the solution (or at least the beginning of a solution) is somehow inevitable and baked into the cake.  This system may die next week, but it could also limp on for decades.  Worse, it may “die” in the global sense, but not bring any significant changes inside the country, other than us all being poor. You still get the trannies but you cannot afford to live a decent life. Everyone has to take the bus and live in ze pod.Optimism is good, but it is only really good if we are shaping our own future and not waiting for some inevitable event that will rush in the glorious new future or offer an opportunity to fight.Maybe there is a giant network of right wing people who have all the ducks in a row so that if the balloon goes up, we will able to have organized resistance.  But AFAIK, no such system exists.  If things are truly as they appear, if some kind of “civil war” breaks out, anyone who decides to participate is going to be slaughtered.

                @TarsA very sane and realistic comment. I don’t see a civil war happening.  Only when there is absolutely nothing left to lose will people consider entering a conflict.  It will result in a lot of chaos.  Instead of us against them, it will more likely devolve into various tribes and clans just shooting anyone they don’t recognize.  There will be carnage.That being said, I don’t think any of that will happen.  In fact, I think the left will use time to slowly grind the White population down to nothing.  There are already not enough actual “Americans” to really do much.  In another 40 years, there will be almost none.  This former country is completely unrecognizable from even 20 years ago and no one is going to do much about it.The only thing you can do is wait for it to topple over.  Support anything that leads to the destruction of these “United” States.  Separation and secession is the key and know that the state you live in is actually your country.  Stay away from ferals and other low IQ savages.  Tribe up…

That’s not really true. People will jauntily enter a conflict not realizing that they are playing games with life and death, and will continue being obtuse about things even after the bodies start stacking up like cordwood. The Ukrainian situation certainly teaches us that much. Sometimes it takes people years to figure out they’re at war. The American Civil War is another case in point.

                I don’t think that a resolution to the current situation is baked into the cake, I’m only stating what I think is most probable. And I’m not advocating that anyone “participate,” but only that people take steps to survive coming shortages and obviously, to protect oneself and one’s loved ones against looters and marauders. Remember, most people in civil war situations sit it out if they can.

                Any such fight will be initiated by the Left not the Right.The Left is good at organizing  such things and many Rightists wander about dumbstruck than people can be told to get a pallet of bricks ready in case of trouble or to get tents in a certain color. It seems like some conspiracy when in reality 10 year old kids with smart phone and cash can do itThis lack can change whether authority wants it or not, thus the reaction to J6 and C-Ville  but leave me alone individuals no matter how superior the fighters will lose to those who are organized and  want powerAgain that can change but in any case, the Right has no common values no interest in power and treacherous leaders but  it will defend itself, will evolve its defenses but won’t start anything

        The Brent Spence Bridge is the I-71 / I-75 bridge connecting Cincinnati to Northern Kentucky. It has been over its capacity and a death trap and they’ve known they needed to replace it for at least the last 30 years. Even with the powerful Mitch McConnell in the Senate, they weren’t able to scrape up a measly 1.6 billion dollars to replace that bridge, even though 90% of it is in Kentucky. But they’ve got an open checkbook for Ukraine all because we’ve got a neocon cancer in our government and they’ve got sick fantasies about resurrecting greater Khazaria whether they realize it or not.And the Republicans don’t understand why the base is livid?

                Mitch, I have heard, was gently eased out of the Army because he was caught with his pants down with another soldier not a female. He knew the right people and was being groomed for politics after his Army time was up. He hasn’t changed and has to do whatever his masters tell him or else. I don’t know much about Kentucky politics but I suspect he has had his last couple elections fortified for him as has Graham.

        Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan believe in a recent interview that the Intel people control everything in the US and the West. Various Zerohedge articles make the same point. If you read between the lines of Putin’s complaints about “they” deep sixing his proposals to Clinton and Bush, it points to the Intel people. Who Chuck Schumer says can remove Presidents. Lt. Col. Vindeman, the Ukranian Shadow Defense Minister and National Security flunky, believed Trump should have been impeached for “ignoring the inter-agency consensus.”Since the Traumatic fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the Intel Community along with the Army (the Navy lost post Reagan) has had the following formula to avoid a “Peace Dividend” that gutted the Navy and Air Force: conflict requiring periodic “big Army” intervention against a shambolic regime (Iraq twice, Afghanistan). Lots of “ninjas” who fast rope out of Blackhawk helicopters and cheap drone missiles blowing up shambolic third worlders. Internal enemies and those opposed to the spending and GROWTH of the Intel people are labeled traitors etc. No real high intensity war like Korea or Vietnam. [I believe their avoidance of this has now shifted, permanently, for reasons I don’t understand but I can see the shift.][I admit this is just speculation, but the Regime is very opaque in what it wants, and the real power players.]Since 2021, this has gone into overdrive with the massive importation of young, military age men specifically recruited from criminal gangs into the US for a purpose. The NGOs importing the immavaders have intel people all over them. They are funded by State/CIA/Soros (same difference). Where Soros ends and the CIA begins is unanswerable.The plan as I see them telegraphing: A. Trump convicted by end of May. B. Trump “Epsteined” in prison by early June. C. Reps put up Nimrata Randhawa as designated loser ending all political/cultural resistance to the Regime. D. Massive troop deployments of regular Army to Ukraine by mid-June. [Like Ukraine billions there will be no one to oppose them]. E. Some sort of “emergency declaration” by late June / Early July to allow the Regime total control including seizing houses for “immigrants” etc. F. A draft enforced by all those young, criminal, military age men going around in vans and abducting White guys JUST LIKE UKRAINE. G. The draft will be for EVERY White guy capable of activity, and will be for industrial production as demanded by the UK’s former defense secretary in statements several months ago in the FT. H. Some sort of massive US/NATO offensive to push back the Russians and inflict defeat upon Putin. This seems “the plan” from what I can see. NYC is now filled up with West African immigrants demanding better food and that people learn their languages, they are even taking over HS soccer fields during games because they can, and know THEY are in charge as the Regimes door-kickers and jackboots.Clearly, the Regime is not worried about the election. The recent “put trannies in girls K-12 locker rooms” Title IX order shows the Regime has the election in the bag. Guaranteed. Even the most deranged cool Wine Mom does not want her daughter molested by some weirdo in a dress in the Junior High Locker Room. So Trump is predictably a dead man walking. It is the sort of Color Revolution thing the CIA specializes in, “covert action” squared.Muggeridge’s Law corollary: think of the most insane, stupid, and evil thing our Regime could do. Then expand on it. That’s their plan of action.France and Poland and Germany have already sent combat troops to Ukraine and Macron is calling on European leaders for a continent wide draft and “don’t be cowards” to fight Russia in Ukraine. We have sent “advisors” to Ukraine already, which means tens of thousands of combat troops are already there as the official numbers of “less than 60” means in reality, over 20,000. The eventual bulk of US combat troops are going to be experiencing heavy, heavy casualties as the US is not prepared for the type of high intensity, near peer adversary warfare that is Ukraine. Hence the need for the Draft which is a two-fer, eliminating YT which is key objective of the Intel Community.Complicating factors: as was utterly predictable, having run out of YT to hate and take the place in the elite factions, places like Columbia are now trying to run (((certain people))) out of there, and after that Wall Street (Hollywood has already done this mostly) as the black/muslim coalition looks at the spots taken by ((())) faculty and students and figures those belong to them. Like Karen Carpenter’s diet plan and Jim Fixx’s jogging habits, the coalition of the Ascendant hate YT plan worked gangbusters until it didn’t.[Biden’s biggest risk is not electoral but elements within Wall Street associated with the Intel Community deciding that the Coalition of the Ascendant will come too soon for (((them))) and deciding to deep six him and install OMB or backup DeSantis instead. Hence his “on the other hand” comments out of the WH about the Columbia jihads.]I certainly could be wrong and hope I am, but that is my pessimistic take on things.

        Military sources say the army is forty percent short of men—I forgot to note that the History Legends guy on YouTube spoke about this and how, even though the units are short 40% they’re actually short close to 100% in terms of frontline troops (as Z does reference here).  A lot of the troops in the “back 60” are either incapable of frontline work, or (quite likely) they bribed their way to be there and will be in no mood to get moved into the trenches.

        I like to share something personal that is relevant in this context. Some of you already know that I am an excellent chess player. Most adults, who know me, think I am the best in the world, and I always brag about it. Modesty is not a disease I suffer from.Every once in a while, I challenge some elementary school kid and defeat him in chess. I also mock him non-stop about how stupid and inexperienced he is. Actually that is quite true. Third graders these days are really dumb and cannot play chess against the smartest player in the world.A few days back, I challenged this guy running our local gas station. He looked Slavic (semi-mongoloid) and therefore is obviously dumb. I invited a bunch of my friends to watch the game that would lead to his humiliating defeat.  As expected he made some stupid moves, and I mocked him in my quintessential style. What does a gas station guy know about chess anyway?Later it turned out that his bad moves were actually quite smart, and he is about to win the game. But I still have some surprises for him. We bet $200 for the game, but I pumped $300 in my SUV that I won’t pay for. Later, when he is not watching, I will throw rocks at his gas station window so that he loses more money.I am the best !! I am the greatest !! I am the “shining city on a hill”.

        For a look inside this absolutist point of view look no further than Landsey Graham’s recent “rebuttal” of JD Vance:https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/21/graham-slams-vance-ukraine-math-00153519Graham’s “evidence?” He went to Ukraine and the Ukrainian general staff assured him that if they sent more money they could win the war. They told him the new conscription law would bring more than enough manpower to win the war, therefore it must be so. Nevermind those pesky facts and diving into the numbers. Come and listen to the Ukrainians!Now we could believe Graham is either A) lying. He knows the situation is dire, but he’s on tge tit of the MIC so he’s got to keep the money flowing. Or B) He’s an incredibly stupid mark. He doesn’t understand the Ukranians are lying to him to just try and suck every last dollar out of their benefactors before they collapse. I lean towards B with Graham, but there are certainly reasonable arguments for both. What I do know is you can place Graham up there with Mitt Romney for people that deserve the French Revolution treatment.

            If Graham were deliberately lying in contravention of the known facts, in all the pro GAE warmongering pronouncements that he has made over the years, then a lifetime Oscar would be a woefully insufficient recognition of his acting skill. He would put Olivier, Brando, and Day Lewis all to shame. So I’m with you, I think he actually believes his own bs.

            I love the Seymour Hersh story last week that claims CIA director Burns (now a Cabinet level position) flew to Ukraine in January to tell Zelensky directly to stop stealing so much money and start spreading it around the lower echelons before he had a mutiny on his hands.
Good talk. I guess that was enough to fix it, because we’re going to send infinity dollars.

                    Hersh writes what he’s told to write. His stuff is straight from the intel community. Some of it is modified limited hangout that makes you believe he’s his own man but he writes some things that are press releases straight out of Langley.

        The fate of Ukraine is kind of beside the point. It’s not as if the “fall” of Ukraine would be the end of anything, with respect to the struggle between the GAE and Russia. Just lines on a map moving around. Renaming of some part of the map, when the time comes. But the struggle will go on. Nobody can afford to walk away.Which begs the question of whether or not either side is capable of winning, and what it would look like if they were. Yes, the GAE’s armaments production is inadequate, but that doesn’t mean Russia is capable of blitzkrieging their way to Germany anymore than the GAE is capable of marching on Moscow. I don’t think a military victory is possible for either side.So the war will go on, until one side or the other loses enough political legitimacy to cause something to change. Sort of vaguely like 1917, maybe, although not necessarily with the revolution happening in the east.

Bro.
There are a solid 2000 years of Anglosphere history in London which will have to be removed to at least Wales [if not all the way to Greenland itself] before we can talk about glassing London.
We will glass NYC long before we will even consider glassing London.

                Almost certainly they don’t want to. But they, like the GAE, are in a position from which they cannot disengage, regardless of who “wins” in Ukraine. So they can’t end the conflict without inflicting some sort of defeat on the west, or waiting for the west to implode, which could take a long time, who knows

                    “So they can’t end the conflict without inflicting some sort of defeat on the west, or waiting for the west to implode, which could take a long time, who knows”
the conflict will end with china beating usa.
till then russia has to stave off the european chiuaua countries. And by stave off I mean bomb them like US did Yugoslavia.

            The GAE survived a 20-year stalemate/phony war in Afghanistan. I doubt it can withstand another, particularly if the economic situation seriously erodes. It seems Russia has done well economically since the war. Regardless, the side that can politically best sustain economic pain will prevail a protracted fight. Based on available data, that would seem to be Russia.This may be a miscalculation, but it seems Russia does not want western Ukraine territory, let alone a blitzkrieg to Berlin. The GAE wants to carve up Russia. Which seems more likely–Russia absorbing the eastern half of Ukraine, or the GAE dividing up Russia? To ask the question is to laugh.

        Connecting dots.Yes, existential desperation is the order of the day in DC. They are going all in. They must kill off the Trump candidacy one way or another. They must reelect the pants-shitter as a figurehead so that the real powerplayers can implement the final solution. Expedited tyranny is the only way for the parasites to survive the coming transition to a multi-polar world. They don’t care how much fiat currency must be printed because the dollar is going to die anyway. They are counting on most Americans being unprepared for the collapse and then using the ensuing mayhem to justify a jackboot crackdown. The plebs can stop none of this.We are wired by our ancestral DNA to survive the fall and emerge fighting when the time comes. We should do this smarter, not harder. We should focus on the root of the problem. We should disappear into the fog and then come out to play in the most unexpected way. Innovation, work ethic, and determination is our birthright.The pathogens must go. Do or die.

        Alternatively:The Donks are done. Stick a fork in them. If they cheat in the next election the possibility of blood being shed is high. Were I an American…I’d put a few riflemen and observers on the mail in ballot boxes and the first mule to show up and stuff them…gets shot or kidnapped and beaten to a bloody green pulp. But that devolves into fed-poasting.The play here could be to drag this out until the election with the establishment loudly proclaiming glorious Uke bravery and victory all the way. Assuming a Trump win… he will instantly move to de-escalate and negotiate. The Donks and media slobs will frame it as the treasonous Bad Orange Man snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, and easily 1/3 of Americans are stupid enough to believe it. Such a play allows them to drop this mess on the incoming Repubs and absolving themselves of the blame for it. It is what I’d do in their place. It also will bolster the anti-Trump cucks and RINOs in the Republicans. Expect fags like Ben Shapiro, the NRO, etc. – to have a hay day.But whadda I know? Matt Bracken over on Blab has a post up that says there’s elements of the 101st Airborne and some fwench assets being deployed in Odessa as we speak…All I know is the Donks command the media and twitter mobs… but they have absolutely no control of the situation. Nothing they get involved in ends well for anyone except for the grifters…

            Yep, got to have those “trip wires” in place.  Nonetheless, doubtful the American public will buy off on a tête-à-tête with the Russians.  Yeah, a good percentage will wave the flag—until the economy sinks fast upon the realization of war and total financial collapse of the GAE upon completion of the event.  This would definitely be the acceleration event many here have hoped for.
The bottom line is as always, war is as much an economic undertaking as a military undertaking.

                    Yes. I have to believe that The Regime has lost too much credibility in order to mobilize the only men who will be conscripted not just to fight, but to fight effectively in a trench in the WW-I of the 21st century.In the end it doesn’t matter what I believe. I hope that they have done so much damage, and opened up so many fronts in their war of conquest, including the war against Heritage America, that not nearly enough men will go and fight for them.Conscription could be a moment of truth. I could see a scenario where the geriatric Vietnam draft card burners who run The Regime now, have the tables turned on them by the grandchildren, nieces and nephews of the patriots who went off and died in Vietnam while they turned off and tuned in. It would be poetic justice.It would be the end of it for The Regime. Staggering losses, opening its society to invasion, undergoing compounding inflation and unable to raise an army that is not fighting for anything other than a paycheck.We can only hope, as this continues to play out.

        The government here really seems to believe it’s 1917 or 1941 and they can marshal the resources and population to tip the balance to all that’s “good, beautiful and democratic” in the world.  However, back then, this country was run largely by competent White men, the population was largely White and most people had faith in the government.  None of that is true anymore and it’s not even close.  At this point, there’s nothing the GAE can do to alter the current trajectory.  The $64,000 question is will they realize it, or be forced to, before it’s too late?  Current trends don’t look promising – incompetence, evil and darkness are descending.

            Resources, not likely but possible.  Population even less likely.  I am morbidly curious to see the reaction to a GAE draft.  Given no politician up for election in this cycle even dares broach the subject pretty much gives the answer.

                At attempted draft would cause the country to explode. It is about the only thing as of now that would. Ukraine is running out of troops right now. Even more than the lack of armaments, that’s the gorilla in the room. There may be alternatives explored ranging from immivaders to farming it out to…coming up blank there. But, yeah, a draft would be unimaginably volatile, although that certainly wouldn’t preclude one given how erratic the Regime is.

        The corollary to the question “Why has Ukraine not yet lost” is “Why has Russia not yet won?”We know what Russia’s goals are — 1) to reclaim the Russified territories in eastern Ukraine and Crimea, and 2) to prevent the remainder of Ukraine from joining NATO.It has achieved the first already; how can it achieve the second? By leveling Kiev and threatening to level the rest of Ukraine until Ukraine sues for peace. Why has Russia not leveled Kiev? Presumably because Russia thinks this will lead to NATO or NATO-backed Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil, expanding the war dramatically.Is the Russian strategy simply a war of attrition, then? It would appear so, but this does not answer Z’s question of how it ends.Perhaps the Russian goal is to bankrupt ZOG, similar to the way the Reagan administration helped bankrupt the USSR by backing the mujahadeen in Afghanistan…

            The quickest (and surest) way to bankrupt ZOG is to put in place a currency to challenge the dollar.  Likely, it would be a joint venture backed mostly by China and Russia. But that is tricky, given China depends a lot on US markets, so a USD collapse would likely affect China significantly.  We are in a Mexican standoff of sorts.

            They have achieved both.  The NATO Secretary General said so a couple of weeks ago.  Now, Blinken is still out there saying Ukraine will be in NATO, but the fact that he was countered a day later, by NATO, speaks volumes.  You have the likely winner in 2024 also saying there’s no need for Ukraine to join NATO.Russia has achieved most of its goals.  I think they might simply be grinding now to eliminate Ukraine as a viable force on Russia’s borders and to cause a political collapse that sees Zelensky deposed.  If they’re patient, they might well get a pro Russian replacement…And, by bleeding the US dry (equipment, money), they make it harder for US adventurism around the globe.  The “threat” of America providing weapons is now shown to be a hollow promise.

                One of the reasons those Russian territories were attached to Ukraine was to keep pro-Russian sentiment in the majority. It’s going to be interesting to see what the sentiment of rump Ukraine is going to be after this war is over.

                    They have to watch out for peasant revolt.  I’m sure the Ukrainians know Zelensky is a puppet.  The citizens living under puppet regimes of the past have typically not treated the puppets well in the aftermath.
Probably why we got a blizzard of weird news about Zekensky buying multimillion dollar property in the West.  I’ve never believed in coincidences.

        It’s hard to believe that the DC people actually believe all the nonsense they spout, but their behaviors seem to indicate they do.
I saw a thread on 4chan the other day talking about the idea that Homo sapiens had developed a parasite similar in kind to slave maker ants like Polyergus.
Initially I thought it was just another /pol/ schizo thread, but I reconsidered after seeing video footage of Congress this weekend. You could practically see the brain slugs jiggling while they chanted “Ukraine!”

No one likes losers, especially Americans.
That attack on Iran was pathetic.   Plus hezbollah is going to whip their asses.  Forget Iran.
Iran hit a military base in Israel.  I don’t see how anyone can understate how bad that was for Israel.  Imagine a missile hitting one of our bases.  It would be 9/11 turned up to 11.  Double that.
Once the idea begins to stick that Israelis are losers, it’s game over.

            I’ve taken heat here before for this, but Jews always have been the junior partners to the Puritans. Yes, they are extraordinarily powerful and vicious, but they lack the discipline and stability of the Yankee and as a result cannot be paramount. That take may be wrong, mind you, but either way the sun is setting on their perch in the United States. It is not without irony that the feral children of the Puritans are giving them so much grief now, and those they used as weapons against us have been turned on them.Some yesterday were calling for the National Guard to be deployed to campuses. That’s something. And it didn’t happen.

            Don’t know where you get this idea of why people are turning on Israel because they are “losers” now.  My observation is it’s because the mask has fallen, and the true psychopathic nature of Israel has been laid bare, along with the noticing of their undue influence in the GAE.  In other words, as 109 times before, they have overplayed their hand.

                Depends when you were born, I’d guess. ‘Loser’ Israel would be very disillusioning for some. Maybe even scary, as a lot of people tie the blessing of Israel to America’s fate. (Just felt a little sick tapping that lol.)

        My sense of things is that Ukraine is to the U.S. what Afghanistan was to the USSR
This may be the thing that bleeds us dry.   There is no way we can finance a major war effort in terms of artillery production and the like and replenishing our stocks and also coming up with new stuff without bankrupting the country.  Especially at these interest rates.  The infrastructure is already falling apart.  The social fabric is pretty threadbare.  And if the government only cares about war, I say it’s our Afghanistan.

            The Soviets only lost 15,000 men in Afghanistan, about the same as the US in Afghanistan, so not very similar to the Ukraine…The main problem to the US is that the Ukraine war has destroyed its credibility across the board, as US weapons fail to stand the battlefield test, and the sanctions have boomeranged badly, and Putin has become much stronger with a booming Russian economy…

                Say what you will of the Russians in Afghanistan, when they left they took all their people and equipment with them. One of their generals was in the last vehicle that crossed the border on the way out.
Contrast that with how AINO left.

            America’s Afghan moment will probably be Taiwan and not Ukraine. Russia is a proxy war and a loss could be blamed on NATO or Ukraine.  There is plausible deniability of a loss.Taiwan will not be a proxy war. It will involve America directly. It would be a loss that doesn’t like we just got bored with it like Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam. It would be a loss with carriers on the sea floor and lots of planes shot out of the sky.

                I don’t know that any war will be the GAE collapse, aside from one directly on our soil.  What could hasten the collapse is the collapse of the USD.  Perhaps these wars will be an indirect cause of the USD collapse, but the USD collapse could happen without such wars – e.g., if a BRICS currency ever gets going and the GAE printer can no longer go whirrrrr.

        Absolutely brilliant post today.
“This is an irrational position, as the Russians have no reason to change course. If anything, they have new motivations to find additional pressure points on the West. Based on recent statements, the Russians seem to understand this.”
It’s just outright stupid. Not just stupid, but nogger stupid. It’s like a moron playing a game of chess against a grandmaster. The empire is drawing to a close with morons at the helm.

I tend to agree.
Couple that with Russia’s strong air defenses and network of functioning fallout shelters and I don’t think a GAE nuclear attack would be all that successful.

        Ukraine is the hill that the GAE has chosen to die on. They will never give it up, because to do so means the end of the Bretton Woods order. Either Putin falls or the GAE does.The only question is whether NATO troops will go in before or after the election. My guess is that they would prefer the latter, but if Biden looks hopeless come late summer, they could use war to justify de facto martial law. They won’t cancel the election, but the censorship and “ballot security” they put in place to prevent “Russian interference and disinformation” will amount to the same thing.

            The hill for the GZAE to die on is called Zion. At most only the GLAE (global liberal American empire) will die in Ukraine. Jewish billionaires, the American Defamation League, the Southern Parasite Law Center, the HIAS, sundry rabbis, and so on are already plotting and playing their moves for the transition.

        The Russophobes in the dissident right are really in coping mode, bleating out how we mustn’t forget that “Putin started this war.” That is a close analog to “Hitler started the war” being used as an excuse by the enemies of nationalism—or anyone with a sense of European identity whatsoever—to justify the total destruction of Germany, the slaughter of her civilian population and the subjugation of an entire country to permanent occupation (the Ukraine conflict may even be leading to a resuscitation of the Morgenthau Plan).

While the Second World War has been effectively weaponized by our ruling elites, the Ukraine conflict is a good example of the degree of foolishness on the part of some dissidents, and their utter failure to learn any lessons from that period in history.

                That may well be true for most of us here. You could get a different impression from the folks at the Scandza Forum. My point is for all the obsession with this period of history it’s surprising sometimes how little has been learned from the disaster—either by the left or the right.

        Even though Afghanistan is oft-mentioned, what is never mentioned these days is the United States’ misadventures in Syria. The USA triggered a color revolution and ended up in a full-blown proxy war with Russia, and Russia won. This is without dispute. Obviously there was no introspection in DC after this defeat, nobody was fired, nobody was pulled off policy detail, and they just kept plodding along. Yet I am sure Russia learned a lot from it and they put it into use in Ukraine. Bottom line, they learned the USA is more bark than bite, and is really good at firing missiles at weddings and paying Israel to drop bombs on children, but hardly up for a real war. Not too much of a surprise when so many in charge are women and soyboys.Democrats are going to blame the Ukrainian collapse on the Republicans. They will say that Orange Man Bad made the GOP stall the negotiations and if Zelensky got that money 3 months earlier he would be in Sevastopol right now. This will play well with the base but the base also includes all of the media and most of the federal bureaucracy. Republicans will just meekly shrug and blame Marjorie Taylor Green and Matt Gaetz.

Not sure what you mean by this.  The results of the German version of National Socialism were pretty impressive until the usual suspects rallied the rest of the world (or at least the most powerful of the rest of the world) to destroy it.  And destroy it they did.

                    Gideon:  Counter Currents is hardly representative of the dissident right in general, let alone Zman in particular.  CC went off the rails about Covid and Ukraine – akin to ‘citizenist’ Sailer and a guy called Aesop.  That’s a rather oddball coalition – but it’s not the dissident right.

Most dissidents and other rational people in general want peace and our brothers and sisters to stop killing one another. The outlier is CC, and when combined with its Covid positions, it seems to only go in the wrong direction when the rubber meets the road.

Agreed. But an even odder coalition may be that of European nationalists with their globalist leaders. Don’t really follow them, apart from Fróði Midjord, so I’m no expert. Like Z, I mostly ignore people when they “go off the rails.”

I put them on spam, but the bastards still filled up my voicemail. So I got a new phone, and let the telemarketers fight over who gets to leave me a voicemail that I delete unheard.

Plus all the commentators.  All the smaller blogs associated with these larger blogs also express neutrality or pro Russian sentiment.

            You started with an invalid point, there are no Russophobes to speak of on the dissident right. The DR doesn’t really care about Russia and surely isn’t fearful of it. For us Russia is an example of how to turn around a dying society and culture, that’s all. Normie stuck in the Cold War is Russophobic, we aren’t. I certainly never thought the nationalists were our guys, they were easily recognized as semi-retarded dupes and tools of the thieving oligarchs.

        If the Russians do prefer Biden over Trump then they may play along until after the elections to save Biden the embarrassment of losing another war.

            I guess it needs to be asked: if a foreign leader hated GAE and the legion of idiots that make up it’s subjects, and, wanted the absolute worst for them, which leader would they prefer?
The only thing that can be said, maybe, is that the current arrangement is so unpredictable as to be quite dangerous.

                Because Biden is a treasonous economic, military, cultural disaster, i think that America’s enemies are cheering him on. Why confront America militarily when they are self destructing. Just be patient.

        The Russians know how to deal with neocons and beat them, probably because they’ve spent a lot of time with them in the past. Most people would call it quits and move on, but neocons hate looking bad above anything else. The war will continue, the neocons will get beaten again, and we will all suffer because of it.

        Putin has publicly stated recently that he doesn’t really know who’s in charge in the US. He has also stated that it doesn’t matter who is President. So I’d say he has a pretty good grasp of the situation here.That said, why would he negotiate? He’s winning. The Chinese have to back him up, or else they will get the same treatment. And he cannot trust anyone here to negotiate in good faith.The logic of war is emergent, like any other dynamic mass human interaction. What might have worked one year ago may not work now. When you add emotion, sunk-cost fallacies etc., the trajectory becomes very unpredictable. Cold logic suggests that Putin will stop at the Dnieper in the north, take Odessa in the South and then call for a peace conference. But our cruel historical experience teaches us that any damn thing can happen.

        When Afghanistan collapsed, not a single general was fired, no politician paid a price, no NGO was audited, no money was returned by contractors for unfinished infrastructure projects, no Congressional hearings were held to determine what went wrong and to prevent future debacles.
That was 20 years of greased palms (only with blood, not grease). They’re doing it again in Ukraine, and when the grift stops there, it’ll start up immediately in some other unlucky nation.
People complain about how corrupt Ukraine is; they’re  mere pikers compared to the US military congressional industrial complex.

            Even using Biden-bucks, $60 billion is a LOT of money which is being stolen from the Imperial Capital.Say that 1/2 of 1% gets re-routed: think you could make some friends with $30,000,000?  Think 100 Republican Congressmen would say “no” to a $300,000 contribution, whether in cash or in kind?

                Personally, I hope the crooks (both here and in Ukraine) steal as much as possible of this “aid” money. I know it benefits some really bad people but in the long run, stolen money can’t buy weapons to drag out the lethal conflict. Massive graft also sets up some good propaganda opportunities when and if the tables turn. You wouldn’t need to lie or stretch the truth. Just a nice documentary with a film crew touring some MIC oligarch’s 15th “summer home” in some lavish location would be all you would need to convince everyone of the need for the harshest penalties imaginable.

                I think after 8+ years of Trump talking and failing to live up to expectations, it’s time to stop trying to find excuses for the man.I know what you mean, but (assuming you are right), his actions are just too pathetic, too spineless and too lame. He has this brash, straight talker, fighter-for-the-common man public persona, but he always betrays, makes the wrong choices and shows his lack of convictions. He’s not even entertaining anymore.

Like his dad, all they do is talk and grandstand when they have a point they want to make. Name somebody who would be better not at just talk, but at having an impact. None to my knowledge.

                I am kind of over it, to be honest. He’s blasting every day about how Dems are the real antisemites and we need to back up Israel no matter what and Jews need to vote for him because he supports Israel. While it makes a lot of sense for him to say this right now, in the end, his best case scenario is that Jews end up giving their money to him instead of Brandon, but what will they get out of it? And when they get something out of it, what do I lose? I voted for the guy in 2020 and 2016 but am strongly considering sitting this one out.

            Fascinating how this got meme’d into people’s sense of reality. I went looking for stories quoting Trump supporting these deals and found nothing. He has not had much to say about it. Yet psy-op agents like Michael Tracy have been pounding away at this on Twitter for a week.

                I have to admit that the source I read was also quoting Tracey:https://archive.is/vckep
So maybe you are right (and I am wrong).My excuse is that given the amount of alleged 4D chess played by Trump over the past 8 years, this would fit the pattern neatly.

                        FWIWFox:Former President Trump’s Ukraine loan idea could be what unifies Democrats and Republicans in the Senate as they look to provide aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.BBC:The speaker is also planning to bring a Ukraine military aid bill to a vote next week, months after existing aid funding lapsed.When asked about the issue, Mr Trump said: “We’re looking at it right now, and they’re talking about it, and we’re thinking making it in the form of a form of a loan instead of a gift.AP:Johnson understands he needs Trump’s backing to conduct almost any business in the House — including his next big priority, providing U.S. aid to Ukraine to fight Russia’s invasion.In a daring move, the speaker is working both sides to help Ukraine, talking directly to the White House on the national security package that is at risk of collapse with Trump’s opposition.Doesn’t look like Trump was opposed.This could be just narrative building, but Trump would certainly say something if he were against it, right?

                            Nothing he is Trump saying anything. A few weeks ago he mumbled something ambiguous about Ukraine, but that is as far as it goes. Everything else is vague claims to having read the man’s mind.

                        @Hun:“Trump would certainly say something if he were against it, right?”Again, if he actually did this, I would not be surprised at all. That said and to answer your question, no, not necessarily. Why would he go on record either way beyond the vague comments you quoted?Just as the Left always bribes a Republican or two to claim something is “bipartisan,” they want to spread the blame for Ukraine far and wide. Whether Trump provided them the cover or not does not matter.The rubber will hit the road later this year if Ukraine collapses and calls are made for NATO intervention. Trump likely will be forced one way or another then to state his position. I wouldn’t bet one way or another. My biggest fear is Trump either voluntarily or otherwise will be as a Judas goat to try to lure white American men to fight in this meatgrinder at that point.

                        Yes, I alluded to this in my other comment. “Trump would certainly say something if he were against it, right?”To me, this is actually damning and it fits the theory that he supported it secretly, while trying to keep plausible deniability publicly.Or he is making a calculated decision to stay out of this, which shows his lack of character.

                        There is nothing to be gained by him saying anything. I do not trust Trump at all, but he’s been incredibly disciplined of late. That old line about the prospect of hanging focusing the mind may be relevant.

                        Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.Ukraine aid is massively unpopular.  If it was popular, it would have passed 7 months ago.  If he wades in, the spotlight comes off OBiden and onto Trump.Trump’s position on Ukraine is that if he’s elected it’ll be over in 24 hours.  He’s not running on this or that funding issue.Also, I think there is some fear that the Speaker will be removed and replaced with Hakeem Jeffries.  A bill would be immediately advanced to remove Trump from the 2024 ballot.  The Senate would pass it.The Supreme Court told them they could do this.Trump is better off protecting Johnson.  $60B won’t change things on the ground and no sane person thinks Trump wants war in Ukraine.He’s safe from that issue because when he was president there was no talk of war in Ukraine.  Better to be remembered for that.

                Trump’s oddest quality: Nobody hates him honestly. Even the best-observed list of his failings has to have one weird lie or perfect misjudgment in it. Many, many people’s way of relating to him is by adding more “misinformation” to the pile.I know a similarly cursed guy in everyday life. Even his own wife’s negative impressions of him aren’t true. When he corrects her she remembers she’s wrong about him, but the same wrong idea always gradually fades back in. And *everybody* lies about him. I’ve never figured out what causes it. All he has in common with Trump is that he moves his hands kind of effeminately.Dude’s weird *somehow*, so make up a reason—a moral reason.

                Trump would support the funding to Ukraine because he doesn’t want himself or the GOP to be blamed when Ukraine collapses.  Yes. its a waste of $60 billion but that is a small amount considering what 4 more years of Biden will cost.

        Why fight for a regime that declared a war on the American people unofficially in 2016 but officially in 2020? Any douchebag in uniform, serves for or votes for thee regime on the Potomac, the Hudson or off the west coast is ultimately a nothing, a stooge. Who in the republican party still falls for that patriotic bullshit, guess a lot from their threats against johnson who fucked up his career. Don’t understand their mindset unless they love being the bottom for the new deal regime. Watching ukraine flop this summer and watching their lies, propaganda, their explanations, their narrative, end in nothing will be glorious.

            I grew up near Johnson’s district, not in his shithole state thankfully and have watched it from afar for a while. I had never heard of him before he became Speaker, he was just an inconsequential backbencher who was elected in a district where Satan would win running as a Republican. He looks like a creepy little pervert so I imagine he is easily blackmailed but I have no sense of his electability after all this. The district is mostly evangelical so the support of Israel will likely go over well but I can see problems with the Ukraine aid during campaign. Hopefully he will be primaried but I doubt it and I’m sure the Dem running, if any, will be too much to take for the people there. If it were me, I’d vote for the Dem no matter who.

        Sevastopol harbour has taken a big hit, one Russian vessel ablaze. Unconfirmed reports that it’s the Kommuna, Russia’s largest salvage ship which has been in constant service with the Russian Navy since 1912.According to Mark Warner, chairman of the US Senate Intelligence Committee, there are a fair number of ATACMS in the first delivery tranche for Ukraine, they’ll be in-theatre in under a week.A Slovakia citizen launched a crowdfunding campaign to contribute to buying shells for Ukraine. Otto Simko is a 99-year-old Holocaust survivor and veteran of the 1944 Slovak national uprising against the Nazis, was a key organiser. In 48 hours the campaign raised over €2 million.Some pretty apocalyptic lines coming out in Russia on Telegram and in some milblogger circles, including those cowed by Girkov’s arrest. They believe the new funding deal, the loss of $350 billion in assets to Europe (even if only temporarily until the war ends, but seem resigned to it going to Ukraine) and more have made the long-term strategic outcome of the war for them much more doubtful.

            Reminds me of a scene from the hbo miniseries john adams. Ben Franklin was doing his diplomatic rustic bullshit in the French court and the French aristocrats were singing songs and waving American flags showing their loyalty to the new American cause. Within less than 20 years, that government doesn’t exist with a great majority of those aristocrats and the king beheaded, dead or exhaled and Europe succumbing to 20 years of wars that accomplish squat and shit. A fitting future for the American regime that will come for supporting a dumbass empire and using their citizens as fodder, just as the French did and wasted their capital in a passing match with the brits.

        In the minds of our rulers, collapse of Ukraine is better than a negotiated surrender in which Washington is at the table.A collapse can be blamed on others – Ukrainians weren’t brave enough, the Republicans waited too long to pass the spending bill, China was helping Russia, Russia was mindlessly throwing human waves at Ukraine, etc. Blame others, walk away and have the media never speak of Ukraine again.But negotiations are an admission of failure – our leaders’ failure. Also, the negotiations would take weeks, maybe months, so it would be in the public view day after day. Finally, there would be the signing of the document with our leaders signing their names to all of their broken promises. What’s more, they’d be doing a deal with a guy that they’ve said for two years is Hitler without the mustache.No chance.The administration will pray for Ukraine to make it to November and then blame everyone but themselves when Ukraine finally collapses. The media impose a blackout on Ukraine after a day or two of being forced to report on it and Americans will move on to the next thing.That said, Ukraine will go down as an important turning point in the Global American Empire. The world went into the conflict with the US as the global hegemon, but we’re coming out of Ukraine in a multipolar world, even if the US refuses to accept that reality.

                If a million men perish, there is little hope for a resurgent Ukraine.  Similar to the USSR after WWII, there simply will not be enough men for the remaining women to maintain a replacement population.
Perhaps that’s a part of the plan to restock Ukraine with a new (non-White) population?

            Exactly, great comment.You never hear any concrete plans to achieve a Ukrainian victory. At most, we are treated to nebulous generalities such as the Spring offensive. Actual metrics would allow evaluation of progress and success. I’m not talking about the Help and Ho’s in Congress, who really revealed themselves as greedy children in the employ of their masters, but from the military itself. Given its degraded condition, this may be as simple as not wanting to endanger future employment and promotion opportunities.I agree this is the turning point. If there were to be future honest historians, the pending loss in Ukraine, coupled with the US-supported ethnic cleansing of Palestine, will mark the Empire’s last hurrah, much as Suez did for Britain and France. I have to conclude with the usual warning that the possibility of the psychopaths getting the upper hand an unleashing a nuclear war remains quite real, which throws into question whether a history even will be written.

                I was thinking of Suez, but I don’t think that it’s that bad for the US. That wasn’t just the end of the British as a world force but their submission to being a US vassal state.The US is still a major world power, indeed, the most powerful actor. We’re just not so powerful that we can defeat the others. Our reach is farther and our ability to put pressure on other countries is still beyond China and, definitely, Russia, but we can’t make other countries outside of region submit if they don’t want to. We’re now a regional power.What’s scary is that the US and its tribal rulers will now be forced to treat other countries as semi-equals. We’ll have to negotiate and work with other countries rather than telling them what to do. What’s more, we’re going to get called out when we try to pull our usual shenanigans, like color revolutions or sending our fleet somewhere.As we’re seeing in the Middle East, the Israelis and their American cousins don’t play well with others. They seem incapable of working with others and negotiating in good faith. They seem unable to just be regular people who mind their own business and try to build up the society in which they live.I’m with you. I’m concerned that our rulers will do something crazy out of frustration of not getting to manipulate the world into doing what they want.

                    Suez was when UK and French Clouds had to accept the reality. Others already had. A long-passed friend who was policymaker in the former said the British upper class still LARP’ed like it was 1925 until they were humiliated.
And, yeah, the British and French Clouds then were nowhere near as deranged as today’s versions.

                Jack Dodson:  As you probably recall, I initially took issue with your concerns about nuclear war.  While I still find it unlikely, I now concur that the situation and players are crazy enough that nothing is off the table.  And Israel definitely seems determined to provoke something, perhaps realizing the GAE is definitely in decline and thus wanting to utilize what’s left of its wealth and military power while the opportunity still remains.While people on this side of the divide generally note the lack of future time orientation and delayed gratification to be the natural habit of sub-Saharans, I repeatedly see this same type of thinking from Israel and ‘American’ neocons.  People who ought to know better – about Ukraine, GAE politicians and promises, Covid – just remain stuck on stupid.  The normalcy bias just continues to amaze us.  Husband is still almost the only one at work who didn’t take the vax – everyone else even vaccinated their minor children.  He doesn’t talk politics at work although most know where he stands in general.  But everyone else – at work, old school friends, etc. – just keeps on planning as though NOTHING will ever change.  Insanity reigns.

                    Normalcy bias apparently includes a belief in eternal physical life now. People talk about how the Imperial Japanese and elements of the Soviets and the Nazis were complete fanatics, but the GAE normies are in the same league. I cannot get past that within the span of about a year, people were masked and trembling in dark closets, and then emerged, puffed out their chests, and literally dared to be nuked. I don’t find a nuclear war at all unlikely when these type people are the norm. We had dinner with a couple of these types last night and they might as well have been paranoid schizophrenics. It is very rare I interact with this sort any longer, and after the passage of time to come back into contact with that mindset highlights how deranged they are.

            Yeah they might be able to sell that crap domestically, but even mud-hutters in the Middle East and Africa have figured out the score.  Only nations/states with no other choice like Europe, Taiwan, and Israel are still hitched to the GAE truck going over the cliff.

                Oh yeah, I’m talking domestically in terms of the PR hit. Around the world, they understand what the US defeat in Ukraine and US impotence in the Middle East mean.The US is still a monster power, particularly with the dollar, but we can no longer force countries to bend to our will. We can still apply a tremendous amount of pressure, especially economic pressure, but we can’t outright force a decent-sized country to submit.In a sense, we’re going back to being a regional power. We can tell Europe, Canada and Mexico what to do, but outside of our region, we’re much more limited.

                    Citizen:  At this point I seriously question whether even Mexico gives a f*ck.  It’s basically run by the cartels, who are organized throughout the US as well.  They have people and pot growing in national forests and on Indian reservations.  They have stash houses for sex trafficking in suburban neighborhoods across the country.  They blatantly decide when to let people through to go north, they have refused to fulfill their water agreements under a 1944 treaty (add drought-decimated Texas citrus to Florida’s killed by frost last year).Canada is even further in the grip of Klown world than we are, but I don’t even know how much of that is ‘pressure’ from us as opposed to money and power from the WEF and world bankers.

        Hitler in the bunker hysteria combined with access to thousands of nukes is not an ideal situation. I was reading Annie Jacobson s new book on nuclear war and the people she interviewed are legit experts. Nuclear war is worse than I thought and maybe that’s why key information was conveniently declassified to allow the publication of the book (I assume anything with NSA, CIA AND Pentagon stamps on it is released with an agenda in mind). OTOH, the top ppl must have been told of the same things in her book but maybe they didn’t register with the elevated clowns??

            The last time I read about nuclear war I was a teenager. When the USSR detonated the “100 megaton bomb” (57 mT, akshually), the New York Times printed a graphic of the blast zone centered on the Empire State Building which included our house 25 miles away.
I read Anne Jacobson’s book last week.
Nuclear war hasn’t gotten any better since 1961. Our leaders, and the people who chose them, have just gotten stupider

                    I suspect that the outwardly cavalier attitude about a nuclear exchange exhibited by the GAE regime is intended for Russian consumption. Wouldn’t be the first time the GAE propagated such a story. 40 years ago they had much of Europe quaking in their boots over fear of a nuclear war, but it was all (or mostly) bluster, and it did give the Soviets pause. They haven’t forgotten that. I think it’s a mistake to assume that every single action of the “Biden” regime is just idiots throwing poo.

                    After the recent “scamdemic”, I’m less concerned about the bomb than the official reaction to it from the federal, state, and local authorities—and I’m not discussing retaliatory strikes.
Imagine a strike on an urban area of relatively minor radius and damage followed by a mandatory evacuation of the entire population of that urban area.  Not really possible and would definitely cause more fatalities than the original strike—but so did the closing down of the economy and quarantine of the population due to Covid.  Hopefully people are more wary this time around wrt our authorities knowing better than us.

                        The key takeaway of the Jacobson book (and any child of the 60s knows this already) is that s second sunrise over DC or NY or Kips Bay IMMEDIATELY opens a book with a range of choices that have to be made in 3-4 minutes, and all rational choices tend toward a massive exchange (use ’em or lose ’em) resulting in billions dead and critical atmospheric and resource damage, During the 3-4 minutes the key decision maker may be dead or location unknown. The legal President may be the Postmaster General.When Iran nukes Tel Aviv or Pakistan nukes Mumbai, this particular escalation sequence may not be automatic.But Jacobson demonstrates nicely, with many interviews with people recently in relevant roles, that a limited exchange among the US, UK, France, Russia, and China (any two of the above) is probably impossible given response options in place + inevitable chaos.

We wallow in official stupidity here, but there are still level-headed people in government…and even people on the Joe Rogan – Elon Musk – Tucker Carlson axis of sanity (though not necessarily /our guys/ of course) walking the halls of power. More crucially, I think the power is not in the hands of the media or political class like it once was…it has shifted to transnational agents and billionaires…and I suspect that most of these people are men, and not dumbasses.I predict they will put in a few phone calls and scuttle the process when things really start getting close to nuclear war. War is good for business, but nuclear war is bad for business. And they are usually a few steps ahead of, and know more about, the world happenings than even the most autistic dissident you see on Substack.

                    I have to think that’s true. Intelligence and insanity can coexist but the smarter Globohomo ppl must be thinking that can’t be allowed to happen

        The Ukrainian Army is breaking right now and small units are surrendering whenever they have a chance.  That kind of collapse can pick up steam quickly.
As Z points out, there’s nothing in the warehouse left to buy with all that printed money (tanks, anti-aircraft missiles, artillery shells…).  If France or the U.S. puts a light-infantry brigade in Odessa, they’ll just be a speed bump for the Russians because they’ll face the same shortages.

            Although the Zelenskyy government’s secret police would stop this in a pretty horrible manner, a good response to a Russian invasion of Odessa would be for their local officials to declare Odessa an “open city”—thus saving the infrastructure and the civilian population.

            One need only consider all Russia needs do is remain hunkered in  position, swatting away whatever wunder-waffen and volksturm come at them, and they win the war of attrition.
The Ukrainians and the West have no options beyond that.  Can no one in the West see that?  Really?  Sane rulers would negotiate NOW.  But then sane rulers would have negotiated before the war.

                The Russians have quietly transitioned to offensive operations (reportedly took Ocheretino today).  But whenever they hit heavy opposition, they hunker down into a defensive position while artillery and drones smash the Ukes and, if possible, another unite flanks them.  Their execution has become very impressive.
