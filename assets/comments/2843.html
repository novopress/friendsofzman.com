        I would normally agree with your assessment of Ebola. A hemorrhagic disease confined to the dark continent. But clearly something has changed. During this outbreak, many doctors and medical personnel have not only contracted the disease, but have died. This includes Western doctors and personnel. Has the virus mutated in some way? Or have people become complacent, assuming they cannot contract Ebola because they don’t eat bats? Is the vector changing in some way? No one knows the answer to these questions, at least not yet. I’m slightly alarmed that we are sending soldiers to assist with containment or support. Why? Is the situation so dire that they require the help of the US instead of from Europe?I am not convinced that Americans need to panic about Ebola, but the situation does raise many questions. I will be watching the evolving situation with great interest.

        Alas, Kipling while long forgotten is still on the mark:http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Readings/gods.htmlThe Gods of the Copybook HeadingsAs I pass through my incarnations in every age and race,I make my proper prostrations to the Gods of the Market Place.Peering through reverent fingers I watch them flourish and fall,And the Gods of the Copybook Headings, I notice, outlast them all.We were living in trees when they met us. They showed us each in turnThat Water would certainly wet us, as Fire would certainly burn:But we found them lacking in Uplift, Vision and Breadth of Mind,So we left them to teach the Gorillas while we followed the March of Mankind.We moved as the Spirit listed. They never altered their pace,Being neither cloud nor wind-borne like the Gods of the Market Place;But they always caught up with our progress, and presently word would comeThat a tribe had been wiped off its icefield, or the lights had gone out in Rome.With the Hopes that our World is built on they were utterly out of touch,They denied that the Moon was Stilton; they denied she was even Dutch;They denied that Wishes were Horses; they denied that a Pig had Wings;So we worshipped the Gods of the Market Who promised these beautiful things.When the Cambrian measures were forming, They promised perpetual peace.They swore, if we gave them our weapons, that the wars of the tribes would cease.But when we disarmed They sold us and delivered us bound to our foe,And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: “Stick to the Devil you know.”On the first Feminian Sandstones we were promised the Fuller Life(Which started by loving our neighbour and ended by loving his wife)Till our women had no more children and the men lost reason and faith,And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: “The Wages of Sin is Death.”In the Carboniferous Epoch we were promised abundance for all,By robbing selected Peter to pay for collective Paul;But, though we had plenty of money, there was nothing our money could buy,And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: “If you don’t work you die.”Then the Gods of the Market tumbled, and their smooth-tongued wizards withdrewAnd the hearts of the meanest were humbled and began to believe it was trueThat All is not Gold that Glitters, and Two and Two make Four —And the Gods of the Copybook Headings limped up to explain it once more.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of Man —There are only four things certain since Social Progress began: —That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mire,And the burnt Fool’s bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire;And that after this is accomplished, and the brave new world beginsWhen all men are paid for existing and no man must pay for his sins,As surely as Water will wet us, as surely as Fire will burn,The Gods of the Copybook Headings with terror and slaughter return!
