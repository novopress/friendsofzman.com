        I appreciate what you do, Zman.  Over the past weekend, I worked in an office by myself and listened to most of your previous broadcasts on youtube, one after another.  I‚Äôll listen to them all and then relisten.  You are extraordinarily profound and I continue to learn from you and the others who post on this blog.  Everyone, keep up the good work.

        Any podcast that opens with reference to the Defenestration of Prague is worthy of high praise.  I have listened to every one of your podcasts and find them overall to be witty, incisive and superior to so much of the drivel that is spewed across the net.   Keep up the good work.

            ‚ÄúDefenestration‚Äù is one of my favorite words.  Several years ago had a dev project we were working on with IBM‚Ä¶.typical of IBM they brought a gazillion people who did nothing to every meeting.  Finally I pulled their PM aside and told him he had a limit of 7 people per meeting‚Ä¶all excess attendees would be summarily defenestrated from our 35th floor window.

        Here is why Clinton and Obama and all the big fish are headed to prison (or worse).  They have raised the stakes so high, that Trump has no choice but to ensure they are smashed permanently.  Otherwise they will get him after he is out of office.

        What Theforgottenman wrote, with bells on it.  I appreciate good craftsmanship.  The content is interesting, too.
==========================
Regarding the Bohemian Revolt segment, two words:Byzantine Empire
If nobody _expects_ the Spanish Inquisition, everybody _forgets_ the Byzantine Empire as the other part of Christendom and ‚ÄúThe West.‚Äù  Whether as a counter-example of how Western Civ is done or as the unbroken repository of Western writings going back to the ancients.
The tribe has their ‚ÄúNext year in Jerusalem,‚Äù but I find more stirring, ‚ÄúNext year in Constantinople.‚Äù

        I was watching a German news show‚Äôs coverage of the Iraqi elections, and they interviewed the guy who threw his shoes at George W. Bush. They asked him if he regretted throwing the shoes, and he said that his only regret was that he didn‚Äôt have more shoes to throw. He‚Äôs regarded as the Iraqi Nathan Hale, pretty much. ‚ÄúMy only regret is that I have only two shoes to throw for my country.‚Äù  Years ago I was in Sadr City, which is like a borough of Baghdad, and makes the worst American ghetto look like a daycare center. When we came through, sanitation workers were literally wearing hip waders and using push-brooms to slosh the blood from a recent attack into the gutters. I‚Äôm telling you now that the difference between Saddam and Sadr is the difference between John Gotti and El Chapo. Killing someone like Saddam or Qaddafi is like slaying the zookeepers and releasing all the animals. The Middle East is like ‚ÄúChinatown.‚Äù Try to do ‚Äúas little as possible.‚Äù

        Another great podcast Z.  Always feel a little bit better after listening to it.
Kind of like a recovery program üôÇ Nice to know there‚Äôs other people out there that think the same.
Well spoken with a sense of humor to boot !

        You can Google image search Letitia Chai and find pictures of her in her bra and panties while she stands in front of the classroom. She‚Äôs a decent-looking Asian chick with a bit of a plain jane body. Z-man aptly points to her behavior as an example of feminism‚Äôs wackiness. Chai‚Äôs antics offer a nice illustration of how half of what feminism claims to represent contradicts the other half.

            Unless it‚Äôs light colored underwear it‚Äôs not really underwear.  Not in the embarrassing sense underwear is meant to be.  A black sports bra and dark panties is a cop-out.  She wants credit for going true undie?  Sorry, no dice.

        Another great podcast! Really enjoy them. By the way, re your Kansas item, ‚ÄúOlathe‚Äù has 3 syllables, not two, and the a is long. It‚Äôs the county seat of Johnson County in the Greater Kansas City area.

        I appreciate Z for challenging Enoch.  We can‚Äôt afford intellectual complacency.  Mike believes we must exclude all J*s and Z thinks we can partner with some of them and cannot appear mean-spirited to normies.  I agree that it would be a boon to have those capable J*s as allies.  In theory, there may be individual J*s who will support us without treachery but in practice how do you screen for them?  J*s are one of the most ethnocentric and devious peoples in history.  Even trustworthy J*s will probably have kids that revert back to the anti-white mean.

            This is where the Internet can be used against the J-left. Social media history, occupation, etc. A question like ‚Äúhow do you feel about Israel defending it‚Äôs borders with deadly force?‚Äù and other such things (BDS perhaps). Maybe take a page from Identity Evropa and screen people. Personally I think we should do everything in our power to encourage aliyah.

        ‚ÄúGain‚Äù is the sensitivity control. Turning it up will make things more distorted, but also bigger-sounding in the overall mix.

        Thanks for another great podcast. One of my weekly listening pleasures.I had to laugh quite hard during the crab picking segment. The Eastern Shore has been playing the H1A game for several decades.  IIRC they have a group housing setup for the workers and most importees are female. The hours are long and the work tedious. The humorous part was imagining the welfare queens working 6 days a week and not eating half of the product.Quite a lot of the crab places in Baltimore City and the suburbs are kept afloat by using SNAP benefits to pay for the crabs then charging a buck to steam them. Of course the locals then toss the consumed crabs wherever. Nothing like working in an alley on a hot day with crab remains rotting nearby‚Ä¶

        The house was quiet, i tried one more time to listen to the podcast.  My very poor hearing has not been up to the task before.  What a pleasant surprise!  Closed captioning!  Thank you!

        A little late to the conversation, but Gain is basically volume depending on where it‚Äôs applied ‚Äì before or after a given effect or nothing more than thru the channel. Best with your new equipment, but a general rule is to check 250k and reduce it to a degree to make the mid-range (your voice in this case) sound better. Back it down a bit and see how it sounds to you. There is much more to be had with a few simple rules on any basic gear.Good luck and please present a detailed list of gear for a more detailed opinion. I have access to a very talented long time engineer who‚Äôs opinion is free.

        In unrelated news today, in the wake of a school shooting, the left has been harshly ripping the beloved boomercon/Charlie Kirk meme of ‚Äúattractive white woman holding firearms‚Äù. The gun rights movement is descending into farce as any sense of responsibility is disappearing. No matter how hard they try, some US upper middle class thot is not an equivalent to ‚Äúgirls of the IDF‚Äù.

            On a related point, left-wing teacher unions will never support allowing staff to receive training to conceal carry in the building. The GOP has been whipped by several teacher strikes this year, and the unions will be a key momentum driver for this November that they were not in ‚Äô16.
The proper solution is to pull the troops out of Korea/Japan following a peace deal. Use those funds to provide a school resource officer to every building in the country.
