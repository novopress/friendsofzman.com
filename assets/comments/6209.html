        Denial of reality can only bring death and destruction of the larger culture. If what Matt Bracken posits comes true, the blinders will be coming off for nearly everyone this year. Bracken has posted his essay in many places on the web, but I read it at Gates of Vienna.

        Once again, we witness an unprovoked attack on one of our public servants and what do we get from the mayor of Philadelphia in return for our trouble? A lecture on “tolerance”. TOLERANCE! What a complete imbecile! The Mohamedan cannot suffer the infidel but we must learn to welcome these 15th century barbarians as they attempt to take over our civilization and replace it with Sharia law! It’s simply unbelievable!

        If I get a vote, I want to see the worst instincts of the German people taken out for a spin.

        The Germans as we know are capable of killing on an industrial scale, it will end in tears…I hope.

        I live in a rural village in a South American country to which I emigrated more than a decade ago. The nearest group of persons of African or Muslim origin is located on the other side of a mountain range some 140 miles/230 kms away, and when I came there were none within perhaps 560 miles/900 kms and that was one of the main reasons I chose the place. I lived in North Africa in a Muslim country for 3 1/2 years and was always treated with courtesy and kindness, still have Muslim friends from that long ago and far away time, but I did not to choose to remain there. My dtr-in-law and thus my grandsons are mesitz@s, but utterly unlike the urban rabble one hears of in the US and Europe. I’m of European origin, born in the USA and will not return to either, likely not even for a visit.This video was a shocker, and not because of the truck driver´s attitude. I’ve concluded that what is taking place is indeed an invasion and should be halted and the rabble repressed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=382njADcWvEIt’s sad, really, for the well-meaning and decent folk among the Muslims, but they will privately concede that the Europeans are committing a suicidal error by allowing this to continue. Sadder still is continue it will.

        There have been mass hallucinations in history — witchcraft, Satanic child abuse, end-of-the-world expectations — but they were about perceiving imaginary things.This may be the first mass hallucination involvingnot seeingactual things, like the Muslim war against the non-Muslim world. The facts are there; our own Baghdad Bobs, like this dunce Mayor Kenney, are blind to them. The only parallel is hypnotic subjects given a post-hypnotic suggestion that a person in the room is not there; the awakened subject will behave exactly as if the person really isn’t there. But the analogy is inexact, since (a) “programming” under hypnosis must be performed, and (b) it is done on an individual basis, and doesn’t affect millions of people worldwide.Cultural Marxism is a mass hallucination.

        Addendum: The police officer who was nearly killed by a muslim in the line of duty (and from what I have heard was performing a line of duty that didn’t involve confrontation or enforcing anything at that moment the wretched Koran wouldn’t approve of) may vote Democrat and believe that diversity soothes all. But after this the officer may equally think that welcoming lunatics and their attendant death cult into the States is a thoroughly bad idea. Likewise, other people whose task is to safeguard the law and security may be thinking much the same too.The helmeted German police who massed under orders from the elite to subdue a legitimate protest against the barbarian invasion may have had loved ones assaulted by the muslim mobs, just as in the UK there are soldiers who were dismayed by the reaction to the open murder of British soldier Lee Rigby on the streets by muslims. At some point all these people will turn and not follow the orders to suppress the white and glorify the brown and black. Once that tipping point is reached, I imagine the Great Crumbling will take place very quickly.

        What happened to the (happily, fortunate) police officer is a form of Emperor’s New Clothes, with people seeing something that doesn’t exist in the misguided hope it is really there. Refusing to accept that a person who was trying to end not only your life but also that of your family, friends and even the way of life of a culture is a strange form of blindness.This condition (or flaw in the human mind) has probably existed through history, but the curious thing today is the vast numbers who — like this mayor of Philadelphia — are required to fervently believe, at least in public, that acts of violence by one group do not represent anything ill-intentioned… even though this group continually repeats similar acts of violence. It is one thing to accept in a battle that the person trying to run you through with their bayonet is as scared as you and it is a matter of kill or be killed, but that acknowledges there is a war being fought.We have, perhaps for the first time ever, a one-sided war. One side openly and repeatedly declares they are at war with you and ours, but the response our supposed leaders continually take is a blatant refusal to believe that any conflict is taking place. One wonders how it would have been if Stalin had said, when Hitler’s troops invaded, ‘Oh, they don’t mean it. It’s only just the words of a few people who don’t understand the true nature of socialism, so I will continue to love my German friends and welcome them into my home.’Saying that Islam is nothing to do with violence may sound nice (and naturally be approved by the agents of the death cult who seek to undermine the west) but it doesn’t alter reality. The correct response, which I may not see in my lifetime, is: “If you want war, then you shall have it.”

            Ordinary cowardice is a large part of this pathology. These monsters grew, a little bit at a time, because our leaders did not have the guts to say NO.  They were too busy fighting over the massive loot pile that big government has become – the (D)irtbags  dared not offend their supporters, the others were drug to the same level.  Selfishness and stupidity, the story of human nature.

        I’m not sure what the “worst instincts” of the German people are. I know what we are supposed to suppose they are, but we are plowing new ground here.

Merkel is a US puppet, what she did will destroy the EU.

        I’m trying to understand Merkel, when she replaced Gerhard Schoerder years ago as the German Chancellor she was being promoted as  “America” (Neocon) friendly) Right-wing ruler.
