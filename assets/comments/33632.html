        The EO abolishing affirmative action could have been done by any of the GOP administrations before Trump but wasn’t. Kind of makes you think that the GOP wasn’t all that opposed to discrimination against white people at all, except rhetorically.

            “Jobs Americans won’t do” wasn’t a GOP invention, but their voters fell for it much harder than the other side’s. They invented a race-unrealist mythology in which everyone but white people is diligent and hardworking, eternally gratification-deferring, devoted to the cause of Our Job Creator—and of course “naturally conservative.” The left calls non-whites ourmoralbetters, because they’re not white. It’s axiomatic (made up). The right maintains, equally without evidence, that they’re all justbetter.It started plausibly, with the Japanese worker cast as our superior and inevitable replacement. (Remember?) They are marginally smarter than us, probably, and they’re nice to share a city with, but that wasn’t the story. Their “better” (for business) qualities were being more fatalistic and in thrall to management, constitutionally averse to challenging the righteousness of any hierarchy, no matter how irrational and useless it becomes. Not true, but true enough. They can seem that way. The point was that they be the model for Americans, the one we fail—our race fails—to live up to, and so we deserve to be destroyed.Importing every Japanese person probably wouldn’t hurt us at all, so they never tried that. Instead they transferred those mythical qualities, all that Japanese worker superiority to you, to Mexicans, to Indians—toeverybody. Haitians! Even Haitians now.Executive orders won’t erase this delusion, inculcated over half a century. All but a tiny fraction of conservative/libertarian America believes in it—trulybelieves it. Of those now in power, or ascending to it (or seeming to), only Stephen Miller doesn’t. One guy.

                I remember back in the day Republicans used to say in response to critics of globalist “free markets” something like, “Our American workers can compete with anyone in the world!”
Talk about a back-handed compliment. Instead of protecting the livelihood of its citiezens, an elected official exhorts them to work harder and at cheaper prices than EVERY worker in the world! And the reward for victory is, as always, LESS MONEY!

                    The idea was that America could always outcompete because it had people smart enough to run cutting edge capital machinery. Largely, we still do. But companies have taken their capital elsewhere. Why? America became a bad place to build capital. The ratchet effect.
Hard to believe that in the wake of atrocities committed by the judicial system to the likes of NRA, VDare, Alex Jones, and Trump, there is a single person who doesn’t realize the same kinds of forces have been brought to bear against business.

                    I know someone who works for Giganticorp. If he wants to promote someone, he has to create a new job, post it on the careers page, and (in theory, at least) make his outstanding worker compete for that new job.
The reward for an excellent worker is to compete with the world for his reward.
Yo do not hate them enough.

                        Yep, and go to Reddit’s depressing job hunting pages and see the other side of this. You’ll see all kinds of people complaining about being ghosted by companies that probably already decided to move an existing employee into a spot but had to post it online first to jerk around a bunch of desperate job seekers and then ghost them all. I’m sure this whole rotten game is due to some sort of diversity rules that say they need to recruit outside people if the company staff is too White or male or both.It’s hard to work up much sympathy for anyone who’s a regular on Reddit though because they’re all such whiny little libshit fags. Still, the practice is offensive and only helps feed the eldritch evil that is HR.

                    The term “free market” like nearly anything must be placed in context. If freedom means the absence of government regulation, the US has rarely had anything resembling liberty of markets. Consider the fairly simple cases of trade quotas, tariffs and the like. There’s a reason that, say, sugar costs many multiples per pound in the US as it does just south of the border. Avocadoes cost $1 each here; you can probably buy ten for that price in Mexico (at a guess.) Yes, I know there are arguments – many of them valid, I would even concede – for regulations. Imported goods are, at least theoretically, required to meet certain sanitation, health, quality and other standards. But what’s never stated is that a major reason for the existence of such restrictions is that they protect a domestic market, which is merely an indirect way of saying someone who has economic interests and provides campaign contributions to politicians to insure their domestic markets remain insulated from foreign completion.You could make similar arguments for labor. Whether we like it or not, it’s a fact that – by [third] world standards – the American worker isgrosslyoverpaid. To a large degree this explains the exodus of factories and indeed, nearly any work easily exported. As I think has already been stated, the desire for cheap labor has been the major reason for many ills in our nation’s history, and that’d even include centuries ago when there was little government regulation (chattel slavery says “Hi”). It’s also worth noting that these short-term gains (for the rich) almost always leave a mess for future generations, as our 13% of population being obsolete farm equipment shamefully illustrates.Some of the arguments above are why I never fully embraced Libertarian ideas, such as open borders or no tariffs. I don’t know whether, or to what degree, restrictions on the importation of goods or of “guest workers” is actually good for our nation overall. But I’m under no illusion that those laws are crafted to reflect the interests of the wealthy, and not of the average citizen.

                        “I’m under no illusion that those laws are crafted to reflect the interests of the wealthy, and not of the average citizen.”I think you meant that theabsenceof those laws reflect the interests of the wealthy. We used to have such restrictions and they were actually enforced. The current neoliberal orthodoxy, advocated by the “Left” and “Right” alike, is why we no longer have such laws or just don’t enforce them.Whether the change in focus of the Left from worker’s issues to their support of the whole forest of pomo perversions and feminism was deliberately engineered by the wealthy or was just a stroke of good luck for them arising out of mid 20th century Continental philosophy departments is hard to say. I don’t know how good the evidence is one way or another. What is clear though, is that Left and Right now support the same set of neoliberal policies that benefit no one but the wealthy and certain “designated victim” subsets of the non-wealthy (women, gays, homeless, etc…). It is out of this revolting orthodoxy that our uniparty and that of the UK and other European countries arises.

            Before he was slapped into line, the last of the Old Lefties, Bernie Sanders, opposed increased immigration.  He said, correctly, that “Open Borders” was a right wing position.  The Wall Street Journal always advocated the free movement of labor as well as capital.Its always surprising to find woke people surprised that heavily Laitino border counties voted for Trump.  Cesar Chavez railed against the wetbacks who were brought in by (Republican) farmers as scabs to break his union.Since the time of the robber barons employers have understood that diversity means disunity and a disunited work force is exactly what they want.

                Sanders was right. And not just him, even Clinton understood that illegal immigration lowered wages and undermined unions. Immigration has always been about importing cheap labor, going all the way back to bringing in Irish drunks who were paid in whiskey to dig the Erie Canal.In the past, poor immigrants were needed to line the pockets of the capitalists. The new wrinkle for the modern age is that today, the Democratic Party needs poor immigrants to keep the welfare state grifts running. They need constituents who vote for gibs to keep their bureaucrat-administrator CSEA constituents employed and to maintain patronage appointments in the bureaucracy.

        “For fifty years everyone in Washington pretended that these agencies were a fourth branch of government. Trump has stopped pretending …” …..Those administrative agencies were unaccountable to elected officials. By being unaccountable, that meant that our votes had no meaning and couldn’t change the course of our government. It was impossible for this situation to go on and the entire impeachment spectacle, where Colonel (((Vindmann))) essentially proclaimed that the president was subordinate to the “interagency consensus,” hammered that home.Imagine that. Your vote means nothing. The people you vote for are subordinate to civil servants and that’s how they operated. That was an unsustainable situation.

            Obama signaled this at the end of his term. When discussing the horrors of Orange Man Bad, he said that the American “institutions” are strong enough to withstand attacks on it. That was the first time I remember hearing a government person talk about institutions like this, but this was the attack line they went with and continue to go with to this day. The entire Democrat party fell in line and that is why they are now in love with the FBI and CIA, because those agencies declared their fealty to the Democrat party and were handed the now-important “institution” label. So yes you then get to the point where traitors like Vindman (of course, calling him a traitor implies he once had loyalty to the USA) will proclaim that the “institutions” are really in charge and we are expected to accept this arrangement. Of course, we all know that this is how the government actually works, but it’s an unofficial arrangement, and unofficial arrangements can be broken.

                Like everything else, I think the reasoning behind the establishment of these institutions was solid. You can’t run this government on a shoot from the hip basis, so there needs to be some kind of a baseline just to be able to deal with the rest of the world. They just didn’t think through all of the pitfalls and how to make sure that there were appropriate checks and balances on their power. I’m glad Trump is smashing them to bits.

                    Institutions (bureaucracy) rises to fill in the gaps for weak leadership at the top.  In the case of Congress and the Executive branch, this was inevitable given the quality of our elected candidates and the massive size of the Federal government.
Yes, something’s got to give, but in reality the size and complexity of government must be reduced for any lasting change.

        A new fascinating, but not surprising, twist to the DOGE drama is the Republican counterattack against it. DOGE is showing that the Federal government is primarily a money laundering scheme so what do the Republicans do? They vote to increase the budget. That is just who we are as a people! What we don’t do is return any money to the people in a rebate, whether 5k or 1 dollar, because our brand is built on fiscal responsibility.Think if all those poor. bureaucrats, lobbyists, families of politicians who need high paying jobs, etc! Protecting them is the true meaning of fiscal responsibility.Will be fascinating to see how Trump responds.

            I will say it’s not all Beltway scum. A lot of people getting fired by DOGE work in the hinterlands, think of say the Department of Agriculture, and a lot of those jobs are in red states and red districts. And those jobs are, relatively speaking, much better for people than government jobs in say New York or California from which there are many more options. I feel like Republican Congresspeople who represent these states and districts actually do have a duty and obligation to stick up for their constituents, and I also think that DOGE needs to understand this. Trump gets a lot of support from these areas and a lot of us want to see the government slimmed down but this is just the nature of politics. Reward your friends and punish your enemies. Firing a probationary meat inspector in Iowa is not doing that.

                Only about 15% of direct federal employees work in the DC area. The sometimes stated desire to scatter them throughout the country already happened. That 15% doesn’t include “NGO” employees though. Those are the ones who really need to go.However, the new hires, the “probationaries” who are being let go, well, if they are new and probationary that means they were hired in the last year or 2. Which means they aren’t white and aren’t men, and in overwhelming likelihood are not anything resembling “conservative.” So that politically, nothing is lost by letting these people go. Although I’m not really sure what is gained either, in most cases. The people causing problems are farther up the food chain.

                This is an old ploy, best illustrated by the MIC. The military deliberately spread itself out into every State such that it built a constituency dependent on its local spending. Whether through bases, or production factories, every State will lose $$$ when the inevitable cutbacks occur. This given us an almost untouchable military budget, which we are seeing has produced little in the way of strength against our enemies.Pain will be felt everywhere. We cannot avoid the pain, only spread it around as fairly—and proportionally—as possible. Cut first, fill in the excesses later. Otherwise we’ll be in the same position 4 years from now.

                    To some extent, it’s an old ploy, but you actually need, say, park rangers working at the park, and the parks are more in red states than blue. You need meat inspectors at the meat factory. It’s not quite the same thing as putting a weapon parts factory 200 miles away from the other parts factory when they could and should be next to each other, but it just so happens that each part factory is in a different Congressional district.I understand that we are all going to feel pain from the necessary restructuring. I also understand that Republican Congresspeople will hear that federal employees are getting fired in their district and will complain about it. That’s kind of how it goes. It’s relatively easy to find a Trump voter who got fired and it’s trivial for CNN to write an article about him – it’s great meat for shitlib twitter.That said, it does seem so far, that, unlike the prior Trump term, they don’t seem to really care about this stuff and the sob stories the press is putting in.

There, she was told she’d have to serve one year of probation.On Valentine’s Day, she was fired for “performance,” ending a quarter-century of service.

Our local ranger on the river got promoted to a new position last month and got caught up in the layoffs.  She’s a pretty girl, ought to find herself a husband.We will still see her on the river, she told the news she’ll have more time to hike and float.  She’ll be fine.

My friend was a LT who taught nuclear power.Never really understood it – except that it was in a district that, politically, must have been punished for something.

                    Back when the libs were snickering about how red states were sucking more from the federal teat than blue ones, my response was to compare the situation to carpetbagging in the Reconstruction era.  All that money came with strings attached which overrode local culture and interests, and the people getting it were essentially an army of occupation.
Maybe it was a dumb idea on my part, but no one ever offered a reply.  I still think I was on the right track.

                        Even more so on the private side.  Goldman Sachs placed their operations center (10s of thousands of of personnel) in Salt Lake City and helped turned the place from conservative to liberal overnight via the a massive transplant of libs, Jews and queers from New York City.Defense contractors and consultants in the far DC suburbs would be another example…turned Virginia from red to blue with not even a perfunctory rest at purple.On the international side, look at Ireland.  Ireland circa the 1990s was a poor and parochial country, but also proud and traditional and Catholic.  Then came the international tax shelter status, and then came the corporations and then came the hedge funds and then came the gay Hindu prime minister and same-sex marriage and abortion on demand and the third world immigration and (curiously timed to quash Irish sympathy for Palestine…) the random stabbing attacks.

                        Lots of truth there. Missile bases and bomber bases are heavily skewed into the Great Plains and high desert. So are Indian reservations. So are “federal” lands. And don’t forget all those miles and miles of interstate highway that get damaged by trucks bearing freight from one coast to the other. Not many stop in the middle, since there’s so few people there.

                Slashing the DoD (in charge of aggression) and the intelligence agencies (in charge of spying on the American people and toppling foreign governments) makes sense.  Slashing the Forest Service (in charge of protecting our wildlands) not so much. I hope the DOGE boys and Trump start finessing their game a bit. The Forest Service is mainly staffed by white males, not girls or soyboys. N.B.: my son works for the FS as a geologist (he has not been slashed).

                    I worked for the Forest Service awhile. Decades ago. It was loaded with girlbosses. The smokejumping and technical gigs mostly were filled by white men.
Anywhere else they can hire a female, they do, just like the rest of fed and state gov. And like everywhere else, Team Woman controls the office environments, organizes speech ‘improvements’ (political codes) for Service-wide adoption, and all the rest of the woke totalitarianism.

            Two separate issues here (I agree with you on both, btw): 1. cost-cutting; and 2. rebates.Johnson and the congressional cucks dislike both because they eliminate graft opportunities. As far as the rebate proposal, which is politically genius, it involves direct payments, which are difficult to skim. The only way to make rebates politically palatable is to tie them to something that can be skimmed and/or laundered: military increases, “aid packages” to Israel and Ukraine, and so forth. Johnson is a beta male, weak and pathetic and treacherous, possibly gay and blackmailed due to his so-called “black son,” but he is first and foremost a thief, and theft is the bipartisan consensus.As for cutting costs, there are in fact some things that benefit our people that should be preserved–parks and so forth–but as for the Karen slush funds, these go to facilitate mass migration and other such evils. Those need to go, even if they don’t increase efficiency.

Yup.  Most men in Congress are of this sort, the type of male that women want in power, not the type of male the nation needs.

            I totally oppose this rebate.  The money should be used to pay down the debt and more importantly, not borrowed in the future.
It is likely this would cause another round of inflation.  The government is borrowing like a trillion Dollars a quarter!!

                    I have no clue who is holding the bonds.  But a large chunk of it is probably being used for collateral for something else.  To what extent foreign central banks and foreign banks have the bonds either clear or as collateral, I also just have no clue.  But if we start failing to pay the bonds, new buyers will probably not show up.The simple fact of the matter is the gov budget is way larger than the total taxes collected.  There is nothing to “refund” since every single penny tax payers paid was spent.  Even if they found 2 trillion in fraud and waste, this would still leave a 2t Dollar deficit next year.  AFAIK, we are borrowing 1TUSD per calendar quarter.

                    DOGE can cut $1 Trillion of future spending annually and all it would do is cut the deficit by 40-50%. That’s how bad it is. As of now all it would do is send less money to the bankers going forward. We don’t need a DOGE dividend we need DOGE to stop the government from spending in this out of control way.

What most people are missing is that Ukraine to Russia is like Canada to the USA, but with a far longer history. There is no way we would allow a hostile power to pull off a takeover in Canada like what the USA tried to pull in Ukraine. Would we stand for Russian and Chinese soldiers on the Canuck border?

                        The leftwing faction of the CIA stabbed JFK in the back on that one, so I suspect they were just setting him up to lose in the first place.
Maybe that answers my question above. The Cold War was not only the lifeblood and career of many an apparatchik, it was also a stable balance-of-powers.Besides FDR and Stalin being socialist finks, that is.Cuba was a marker to keep the Cold War intact. It ended, and Islam took its place. (But still, post 1990…?)

                    Why didn’t we swat Cuba though?  That’s been the daily bread for our overt/covert force projection since Smedley Butler.  I really don’t get that one.  Bautista had strong unions, universal healthcare, schooling, hospitals, investment-friendly, all the usual things the Left calls fascism.Bautista just wouldn’t suffer Communists was probably the problem.
The Cuba question never really added up.  An “agreement”?  With whom?

                Obliquely. However, for most of the Ukraine’s history it was either Russia itself (Kievan Rus’) or part of Russia/USSR. There is, therefore, a rather power irredentist argument to make for Russia annexing the Ukraine. Canada doesn’t have that sort of history with America/AINO.

        FDR did pack the court, he just did it in a different way than he wanted to do in 33.  By the time FDR died, all 9 judges were appointed by FDR, plus hundreds of judges across the US.  All of the judges wrote the most important decisions which were taught in law schools.  They all had clerks who would go on to be judges and lawyers and law professors.  FDR corrupted the law far more than is recognized.

        ‘A carnival of subversion’ is an apt description of America in the late sixties and seventies.  Pedal to the metal for intel elements guiding media, especially television.  We lived through an inundation, a saturation, of Prog and Feminist propaganda.
Now it is the cultural air we breathe, mostly unconsciously.
‘You can’t have multiple religions and also have a religious people.’
You cannot.  It is the ultimate tribalism and cannot last.  When Christianity (at the popular level) ruled the towns of the U.S., the nation was a far better place.  Much more insulated from the widdershins paganism of D.C.

I got 20+ years on you but man, I started looking liked hammered crap around 60. You’re good to go, just keep doing what you’re doing (and it better include bicycles).

        The vast majority of these agencies exist for the purpose of being glorified welfare handouts &amp; shylocks.Its hilarious when environmental agents show up to do compliance checks on construction sites in the ghetto. You got bantu subsidized by taxpayers who destroyed the infrastructure that’s being fixed, there’s litter everywhere &amp; they’re sitting on their porches barbecuing, fornicating in broad daylight &amp; shitting in the street. That’s the backdrop as these agents stroll up to make sure there’s no oil leaking from the machines &amp; dump trucks aren’t overweight.It doesn’t matter if you’re pristine as far as the regs go either, they showed up so they’re gonna invent some reason to fine you even if it’s totally fraudulent. Then your choice is to pay it or take a day off work losing money &amp; pay a lawyer losing even more money to fight it. Naturally the courts themselves have a vested interest in getting their own skim so best case scenario they’ll lower your charge to something else so they’ll still get a cut.I thought to myself why not just send us a bill &amp; save a ton of money not having these people around getting paid but that’s not the point. Then I thought why not just expand welfare instead of having this whole wasteful infrastructure in place but then there wouldn’t be environmental theater.Same goes for the politicians who created &amp; vote to fund these agencies, they really care about the environment, you see. Then there’s the fact every one of these employees are loyal to the system the same way bantu are.Finally there’s the sadism angle, all these people get off on lording over the working class, not only are they doing their part for Mother Gaia but they’re also sticking to those backwoods blue collar workers.Its amazing people see this &amp; think we’re just individuals, if not for hierarchy being hardwired into us these people would’ve been overthrown a long time ago. The denial of human nature was what allowed such a perverse system to run wild. The fact they parrot the lies of the people financially enslaving &amp; ethnically cleansing them shows just how strong the hierarchical instinct is.At this point I’m convinced you could put satan himself in a perceived position of authority with his horns, claws &amp; barbed tail in full view &amp; the average person would blindly follow orders from him. I mean that’s not that far fetched when you look at the scores of conservatives who treat monsters like the bantu as misguided saints. Those people have seen the same things you &amp; I have, difference is they’re physically incapable of overriding that follow the leader instinct.

            Your reminder that these administrative agencies have deformed into judge, jury AND executioner. Z was far too kind in his description of what has transpired. Also, unless the reversal of CHEVRON becomes reality, they literally write the rules these thugs enforce, so lawmaker, judge, jury and executioner:

                “these administrative agencies have deformed into judge, jury AND executioner.”Yep, there’s no shortage of examples of this from the ATF in particular though thats no doubt because of the subject matter drawing eyes to it. USDA loves showing up to farms with SWAT teams &amp; I only know that because I know a lot of farmers &amp; both former &amp; amish still in the community. Every one of these agencies is armed to the teeth with even less oversight &amp; transparency than regular cops- ATF doesn’t wear body cameras, for example. When they kick in someone’s door &amp; kill the homeowner you just have to take their word for it that they announced themselves when doing their pre-dawn raids that end with the homeowner being riddled with bullets.I really don’t pay attention to the Supreme Court anymore, after they cucked on getting rid of affirmative action- something virtually nobody except negroes support- I started actively ignoring it. There’s only so many times I can hear “its happening!” leading to nothing before I lose interest.I did hear something about Chevron a while back, that they nerfed it or something but even if they did our wonderful system is setup so every single little policy has to be individually sent through the courts. That plus the court completely cucking on their Bruen ruling shows these rulings are basically meaningless, the Supreme Cowards will never willingly dismantle anything important.On a side note, on Bruen, I like that they ruled the government can decide whose dangerous &amp; disarm people, that stemming from a case of a dangerous spic. If he’s dangerous why is allowed to walk the streets? Conveniently that question was never asked. Bruen should’ve defacto ended Chevron but they did the “well we didn’t akschually mean it like that” about face.They also won’t touch the concept of standing, so the government can violate the law at will &amp; the courts will say “how does it affect you PERSONALLY?” Thus allowing them to do whatever they want with zero consequences.George W Bush was able to shred the constitution creating secret courts &amp; expand mass surveillance, for the benefit of the government of course so its fine. But it sets a precedent I think, the way to end all this is to just dismantle it &amp; when the courts inevitably start crying about it just ignore them.If Trump really wanted to he could even weaponize the very same “but the national security” excuses they used against us against anyone who stands in his way. He’d risk being assassinated but that already happened so what’s there to lose? Legally speaking he could assassinate anyone under the guise of national security, now I don’t expect him to do that but it shows just how much power is sitting there before him he or anyone in his position could wield. They created a gigantic hammer that can be used on anything, all it would take is for someone to use it for the benefit of the people instead of against them.He seems to be on that track but how far is he willing to go with it? Not getting my hopes up but he has no shortage of options to completely nullify the judicial system from the equation. They’ve set forth so many precedents &amp; arguments justifying illegal policies they’d have to twist themselves into a pretzel in front of the public to turn around &amp; say “no not like that!” So he’d have the support of the public for sure &amp; given he hasn’t even done anything that crazy from a legal perspective &amp; they’re already crying about a constitutional crisis his enemies will look like they’re yet again crying wolf.I do hope that this is a sign that we’re inching closer to having people on the right who are willing to behave exactly the way the left &amp; neocons did to enact their agenda. God willing this isn’t just a one term fluke but the beginning of a paradigm shift.

                    There was no turning back once the individual agencies had separate armed SWAT squads and itchy trigger fingers. It is so ghastly that we cannot wrap their heads around it. Yes, the “Right” is there, but there is no small chance that one administrative agency attacks another administrative agency’s thug team and a firefight breaks out between them. It is a miracle it has not happened already. The likelihood is an outlier agency’s goons rub up against a “Right”-cleansed one. How in the hell did this even come to such a point? I think as enjoyable as the last month has been, we are in an incredibly dangerous internal period of transition.

You gotta admit that’d be pretty hilarious to see happen.
I could definitely see thoroughly rotten institutions like the FBI &amp; ATF going off the reservation &amp; doing something like this.

        There’s a caveat to the slavery issue…Slavery was a BIG issue with a relatively small minority in New England..But what caused CW1 was the power of the Northern industrialists, who inflicted the punitive Morrill tariff on Southern imports and exports, mainly to and from England, to protect their own markets..Lincoln blockaded the Southern ports, which was intolerable to the rural agricultural South…Most people in the North did not want blacks moving there, because of the competition for jobs between the existing labor force, Irish gangs, and blacks…Lincoln said that the South could keep slavery forever if it paid the tariff….but in fact, slavery was dying rapidly because it was cheaper to pay the Irish immigrants…

        I was reading the comments regarding people who have lost their jobs.The week after my twins were born, I got booted from a maintenance job in a public high school. Good pay; supposedly hard to lose.The reason? The person in charge of the whole operation needed a job for his “Uncle”. I was the last one in, so I got cut. When I pleaded with the guy, explaining I had just had twins, his response was,”You’ll figure it out”.I did. Somehow, someway, my family and I survived. We laugh about it now.The crybabies who are weeping and gnashing their teeth, will get over it as well.

            My list of things for Trump to accomplish:1-stop the chemtrails2-stop outgoing remittances or tariff them3-free the farmers from the chokehold that Syngenta, Monsanto et al have on them, requiring them to only purchase seeds from the big corporations and fining them if they attempt to grow anything else on the land that used that seed.4-stop all Federal ag subsidies, no more paying people to grow or not grow or raise or not raise things. No subsidized school lunches, no money for sugar growers.5-Term Limits, appointed positions, 8 years lifetime total, elected positions 12 years lifetime total.6-If Congress can give itself a 10% raise with only a quorum, on a Friday night before a 3 day weekend, then Congress shall also increase SS payments by the same percentage at the same time.7-No vaccines for newborns. Used to be no child was vaccinated until they began school.8-Fired Federal employees seeking to regain access to the government teat can only apply for positions one grade LOWER that what they were previously at, and no retirement benefits until they had been in that position for 24 months. The goal is to make private employment more attractive.9-Free the one time felons. If a felon has been “good” for 7 years and their previous conviction was for a non-violent crime, their records should be automatically purged so it doesn’t show up on a criminal background check, this allowing a great swathe of potentially useful AMERICAN workers to find employment.

                    The biggest court case in the United States between a grower and agricultural biotech company wasBowman vs Monsanto. Bowman is a farmer from Indiana who, according to the court documents, “appreciates Roundup Ready soybean seed”. He bought Monsanto’s seeds and planted them for the first crop of the season. However, for the second and more risky crop of the season, he bought seeds intended for human or animal consumption from a grain elevator and planted these in his field. He then applied a glyphosate-based herbicide, effectively ensuring that the entire crop consisted of Roundup Ready soy plants. Monsanto discovered this practice and sued Bowman.

        Part of this dovetails with something I once heard from Ohio Supreme Court Justice Paul Pfieffer, who I remember is being something of a populist Republican. Some law student asked him about the Constitutionality of something and he just rolled his eyes. He scoffed, “Constitutional? If ‘they’ want something to happen it’s constitutional. If they don’t, then it’s unconstitutional.”Pretty accurate assessment. When “they” liked what was happening in the administrative state, the court gave the administrative state a lot of leeway. Now that the administrative state has been going too crazy for too long, the courts are going to rubber stamp pulling those powers back.

                    No, they aren’t. But many of the people who were able to get to know Trump through them probably are. Melania probably has a second cousin who is high in the Slovenian government and Ivana also has high placed family friends and relatives and whatnot as well. I bet he has heard an earful since Clinton decided to bomb Serbia.Don Jr. used to spend his summers in Czechoslovakia. I bet there are a few people in the government who have them on speed dial if they need something.And in those families, a lot of them discuss these sorts of things at the dinner table. It’s fun banter.

            Excellent question.  Who are these new advisors?  Were they there during Trump 1 and now Trump 2 listens to them.  Or is there a new cadre?  Really fascinating question.  Whoever they are, they are wonderfully hidden from public view.  This seems even better as I am always suspect of those who like the limelight.

                    It was so bad in 2016 that Trump couldn’t find a Trump person to run his office, so he had to turn to conservacuck Reince Priebus. The fix was in from the start.
I don’t know what lurks in Susie Wiles’ heart, but she has spent a significant amount of time working for Trump and seems to be on board, and Trump also wisely kept her around after he “lost” in 2020.

                    She kind of scares me. The iron lady does get revenge on people who snubbed her. As in, making sure they lose elections or don’t get appointed.
Still, all pro and a tight ship. Nobody gets past her. People were freaked by the Zionism of Trump’s picks, but that, I think, speaks to a positive: everybody on the team is ideologically aligned.(Plus, the techno cabal backing Trusk is Jish. Powerful friends.)
Effective. Tight. On the same page. Lethal if backstabbed.I’d say you’re spot on that choice.

                Yeah, I saw that Vance post and thought those ideas sound pretty familiar. Vance people must be reading Z. Apparently, they’re doing more than reading Z.
I have to say that I did love the target of Vance’s attack. Ferguson is such a pompous D-bag. He’s the globalist’s court historian.

        Great show Z, and an important idea whether you coined it or someone else.The most revolutionary part of the past month for me has been the realization that for the first time in my life, my government is being run by a leader who is an actual human being, not an egregore created by a bunch of managers and bureaucrats.As hard as the problems facing us are, it is…heartening each day to know that someone is going to try and do something about it, rather than just hoping for am act of God to save us all from our collision course.Side note, it seems very possible that Trump is going to have Treasury issue a competing currency against FRNs. Whatever they are doing moving all this gold back from London has to be the Treasury. If he can kill the Fed he instantly becomes a top 3 Potus.

                I doubt more than a few people know for sure what the plan is, he seems to have learned that lesson term 1.
But when I see billionaires and governments making a bank run for their gold coins the way they have been since the inauguration, it tells me that as a peasant I should be looking for cover.

        It was a good show, Z. I and I’m sure pretty much everyone else has seen a lot of it for ourselves… but sometimes it’s a great way to clarify and simplify so that you can articulate it. Simplified further, it’s a power struggle.
Could this current power struggle trigger a civil war?

            Trump, either by conscience plan or not, has been careful to carve out massive exceptions for the military in cost cutting. I’d say it’s lessoned generally. Plus, this is an issue where most people who doesn’t have a government job are fine with the cost cutting.  It’s thousands versus millions.

                A good insight. Griller McNormie of course is as much an unabashed supporter of muh Defense as he is of muh Israel. A few things are currently off limits to Doge and I’m guessing those are two biggies. Nevertheless all power to them for rooting out and at least exposing the vast corruption elsewhere.

                I was listening early this morning and heard “BOHICA” and that it was a term from the South Pacific.  I thought instantly that it was a term used throughout the Navy, not just in WESTPAC.   I really need hearing aids.

1) You have the archetype of the ideal enforcer; broad shoulders, thick neck and the physiognomy that says you could end someone’s life with your bare hands.  Every group needs one.

                As someone who thinks elections generally do not matter, these little touches of reality make me realize how overstated that is in many respects. Political arrests would have exploded, no doubt, although I have nothing against them when “my” side is doing it to “them.”

                        I expect multiple indictments and arrests as a direct result of the massive fraud being revealed. A republic with elections only can last as long as one side thinks if it loses the worst-case scenario will be the winner imposes its will via policy sans imprisonment and murder. That has ended. DOGE probably is a disguised way to extract revenge via very real crimes that would have been ignored a few years ago. Make no mistake that this has nothing to do with Republicans outside of someone under that banner being a victor. This is a revolution disguised as a legal process. It very well may explode. Nothing was held together once the intelligence services attempted a coup d’etat via the intelligence services.

        Is “ignoring the elephant in the room” the same as Mokita?
I agree that it is not one word.

            We generally look at “ignoring the elephant in the room” as an error or defect in our reasoning. Mokita looks at it as a neutral or positive thing.

                Delusion rather than an illusion, then, and that’s exactly right. We live in a nation built on a delusion that has become untenable due that rotten foundation. Some people did some things and some people with lots at stake woke up, probably too late but hope springs eternal.

        Not sure if it was a good show?
The revelation of chancery courts, and that the role of Houses and Senates, are to resolve first the hierarchy of actual power is amazing. Society must have structure to function as society.  The war on aristocracy was born in the war to replace monarchies.
The 17th Amendment replaced the hard merit system of already rich men being able to gain a stake in their society.
We replaced a natural elite with prostitutes who get richafterelection, a guaranteed way to corrupt the entire system making it suitable for outsider control.
