        ‚ÄúNo, they were concerned about the orderly working of society, the faith of the people being a big part, the part concerning the Church. Fumbling through it was their responsibility and their burden.‚ÄùI‚Äôve spent to much time arguing this online. üôÇ The medieval Catholic church *is* the outlook of science full stop. Do not pass go. It‚Äôs easy to worship science when it‚Äôs evolved forward into almost magic. It looks like a waste of time and effort in 1300AD to anyone but a Catholic, to whom it looks like finding more proof of their worldview.The idea that Galileo triumphed over the Church and that scientists slaved away in hostile conditions is a scenario fit for novels, nothing more. That situation actually describes science for Islam, who would abandon all science after the Incoherence of the Philosophers was published.

        ‚Ä¶Here you go Gunnar:
IQ roughly equals general cognitive ability, also known as ‚Äòg‚Äô.
Below I have provided links to Linda Gottfredson‚Äôs work.The second link provides a chart showing Gottefredson‚Äôs expectations for job and life potential for people of different IQ‚Äôs as well as different races.All of this is highly un-PC of course.http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/users/reingold/courses/intelligence/cache/1198gottfred.htmlhttp://www.thefullwiki.org/Linda_Gottfredsonhttp://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/2005g-jobs-life.pdf‚Ä¶

        Right-wing naivete. In politics I see it most often expressed as a confidence that the sane and rational politics of learned experience will of course prevail‚Äìafter progressive politics has made a wreak of things‚Äìbecause it is after all the only thing that works. But progressive politics don‚Äôt succeed because they work, they succeed because progressives understand the true and instinctive nature of people, and enjoy playing the game of manipulation and power equally under plenty or in ruin. The totalitarian mind did not grasp until the twentieth century was well on that the democratic mind was the one which was most vulnerable to agreement.‚ÄúTo the revolutionary mind the American vista must have been almost as incredible as Genghis Khan‚Äôs first view of China‚Äìso rich, so unaware. Why should anyone fear government? Its cruel and cynical suspicion of any motive but its own was a reflection of something it knew about itself. Its voice was the voice of righteousness; its methods therefore were more dishonest than the simple ways of corruption.‚Äù‚ÄìGarrett, 1939

        Interesting. I know that intelligence is correlated with success ‚Ä¶ but ‚Ä¶ what I have wondered, and never been able to find the answer to, is this: What does IQ measure. It is a percentile measurement, but what does it measure?I know that I am a 6-6 man, and that places me in a certain percentile. The percentile tells me my height compared to the rest of the population, but the measurements tells me a specific number of inches off the floor the top of my head is.If I have an IQ of 120, I know that I am in the 90th percentile. But 120 units of what? I know that I am six inches taller than a six foot man. But what is my 120 units mean compared to someone with 100? I can run 100 yards in 20 seconds. That places me in a low percentile. I know how much faster other people are.But I have no idea what an intelligence unit is. It is not speed of calculation. It is not accuracy of calculation. In that case, someone with an IQ of 75 could eventually do advanced calculus, given enough time, just as a cripple could crawl 100 yards given enough time. Difficulty of problem solving? OK, but what difficulty?One thing I have never seen is a chart that indicates what a specific IQ corresponds to in terms of intellectual abilities. Once we know that, then we can determine the educational and social policies that we should follow.

        Excellent post‚Äìone can only hope Sailer and similar types find their way to it. Egalitarianism is the reigning ideology but its strength does not come from logic and evidence. It comes from giving lots of status and power to people who lack the qualities to rise under almost any other system.
And, as you point out, absurd egalitarian notions are pervasive even among people who are harmed by the Cathedral.
