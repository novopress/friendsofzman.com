If they have women on the faculty, and more importantly if they’re Episcopalian, they’re Christian in name only at this point.
Get a load of the black prof spasmodically flapping his race card around. Ten faculty members were treated identically, but in his case race is relevant. Because Race Card!
That being said, Dunkle is clearly a maniac and an incompetent.
He and his SJW-tard faculty deserve each other. In a small room, for all eternity.

        That seminary is an architectural gem. One would think he’s in Europe while seeing it.

        Well, it seems the faculty has a valid number of points here – it’s a Christian institution being moved in a decidedly non-christian direction. At least, so it seems by this account.Will the faculty be replaced by secular types more interested in un-conversion? Must stayed tuned.
