        He’s pretty much right about “Nixon Derangement Syndrome.” I’m old enough to remember how it was very bad, although I think Trump DS is just as bad.
As was outlined recently in an interview with Tucker Carlson, the Democrats got away with lots of rule-breaking against Nixon, including hidden, illegal stunts to get their way. Possibly a “deep state coup.” Woodward and Bernstein were quickly presented as moral paragons, as in the movie, “All the President’s Men,” which was widely lauded. In reality they were lying journalists who, it seems, were also extortionists.

            Somewhat of a coincidence, I started reading Jonathan Aitken’s bio of Nixon yesterday. I usually dislike the “early life” sections of biographies, but this one is fascinating. Nixon’s childhood and youthful accomplishments, as a student and as a hard worker, put to shame the pseudo-achievements of our “elites”. As a high school senior, he was recognized as the most outstanding academic achiever in California, and received scholarship offers from Harvard and Yale. Due to family economic constraints he had to turn down these offers, to help with the family grocery store, so resigned himself to attending hometown Whittier College. It was the Depression, after all.I am looking forward to ploughing through this book. I’ve always been sympathetic to Nixon, primarily because as a young teenager, I saw the abuse heaped on him, very similar to what Trump has been subjected to. The glee with which the Media and the Democrats tore him to pieces made me, at 13, a lifelong hater of both. That said, I’ve never troubled myself to learn much about the man, aside from reading a couple of books about Watergate.

                And he was virulently hated by much of the Ivy League crowd, the media, and others in lofty positions. He also drew their hatred with his anti-Communism. And he was probably smarter than most of them.  I’d like to read that Aitken book and am glad you recommended it.I think he had a mixed record as president. Positives are that he got the USA out of the Vietnam War (which he almost never receives credit for); he developed detente with the Soviet Union, which some Cold Warriors didn’t like, but which I think was good considering America’s weakness at the time; and he helped morale by tapping into the widespread desire for more law and order with his “Silent Majority” speech, etc. (helped with this by Pat Buchanan).As with Trump, the alternatives, such as McGovern, were much worse.

                        Yes, a lot of it.  Kids nowadays are being taught the biggest lies of all–the Howard Zinn version.  It’s contributing in a big way to our downfall.

                    “He also drew their hatred with his anti-Communism. And he was probably smarter than most of them”The parallels between the two effects, TDS and NDS are pretty clear. I think the thing about both men that infuriates Leftist snobs is not so much that these men advocated “wrong” policies but that they did so while being perceived as gauche and declasse. They also clearly appealed to the type of men who work with their hands but also many who do tricky engineering jobs. Also, both were quite clearly very smart and didn’t fit the “dumb hick” stereotype. This offended the already highly feminized Left because if you look at jobs that require strenuous mental or physical work, you see a bunch of men.I think this also explains why the Left went nuts over Nixon and Trump even when they actually held positions that were traditionally left of center. Nixon’s price controls and Trump’s Negrolatry come to mind. The fundamental divide in this country for the last 50 years has been a class and sex war and Trump and Nixon both got on the “wrong” side of it.

The winners write the history books.
We’ve gotta win this war before you’ll see any honest books being written about Saint Richard Nixon.
And much of the original material has likely already been destroyed by (((the Deep State))).
Particularly the files which are damning to (((the Deep State))).

                Trump and Nixon were friendly. Given that so many Nixon people were in Trump’s inner circle, I’ve always wondered if Trump wasn’t Nixon’s revenge.

        Sweet. Thanks. I’d sent him an email asking where it was going to be but hadn’t heard back. Assumed he was busy figuring stuff out. The podcast is now live in my app (Pocket Casts).  Any chance that the missing episodes from the two weeks between July 19 and August 9 could be added?
