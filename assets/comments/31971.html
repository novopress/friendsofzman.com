        I was in the First Gulf War (90-91).  Everyone who watched the war on TV thought it a cakewalk.  They didn’t see the ports in Saudi Arabia operating 24/7 for 6 months to unload the equipment for an army corps.  We were successful enough that the neo-cons got it in their heads that our military was invincible.
That giant Cold War army no longer exists and the Russians aren’t going to allow that kind of logistics build up.  But nobody in charge wants to hear any of that kind of reality.

            Looking back through history, it is clear the GAE internalized many experiences from the Gulf War that are really not applicable to battling a peer-level adversary.

            We are seeing signs out of the Pentagon and DoD that they recognize this reality. As things stand, NATO could not do what the Russians have done over the last two years, in terms of mobilization of resources, transition to the new type of war and upgrading their industrial base. It will probably take years for the State Department to come to terms with this reality, if ever.

            The same thing happened when we foolishly invaded Iraq. We have restrictions on flight hours that were instantly waived in the war zone. Some of our C-130 aircraft used up 10 years of normal flight hours in a few months. God knows what happened to our strategic airlifter aircraft, the C-5 and the C-17.The thing that most people don’t understand is that sealift is crucial. The American-flagged merchant marine is almost non-existent (thanks Jones Act) and our sealift command ships are often in terrible shape. Also, during the Clinton years, they sold much of our shipbuilding infrastructure, such as drydocks, overseas. Mainly it was to please coastal NIMBYs who didn’t like icky shipyards obstructing the view of their BS lofts.And if the Russkies want Europe, it’s there for the taking. The German army is a hollow shell, as are the other NATO armies. The so-called peace dividend after the Cold War gutted the militaries of those countries. We haven’t done a REFORGER in years to reinforce them and would anyone support such an effort here anyhow? I don’t think so.

                Dr-
I’d love to be a fly on the wall to listen to the aircraft maintainers at various GAE airbases.
This is because the analysis by open source flight trackers makes it appear the regime is flying the wings off the existing fleet.
Not good combined with the fact there is no significant replacement aircraft production planned.

                    As someone in the defense industry, I can tell you that has been the case since the 1990s. The stupid “no-fly zone” over Iraq and the Balkan misadventures started the forever wars that pretty much wrecked our fighter, transport and tanker fleets. Wonder why the wings are falling off F-15s and F-16s? That’s why.

Thanks for the insight.
I spent a couple decades in the comms portion of the MIC.
Based on that experience, I am not at all surprised Russia is owning the EW space.

                Russia doesn’t have the manpower to occupy Europe. Its a hell of a lot better off than in the 90’s but they didn’t get a baby boom either.

            Correct. The neocons still think it’s 1991 and have no idea – even after the last 2 years – that warfare and the geopolitical system have changed forever.

            Hells bells – they ALL are, Sid. Turdo is off his rocker, the Brits have some sabre rattling pajeet for a prime minister, and the Germans and Euros are taking orders from menstrual girl bosses.

            Agreed. But the more history I read, the more I wonder if the past was much better. Churchill was a brilliant leader, but he authored the Gallipoli disaster. FDR administration during WW2 was a hive of grift and corruption eerily similar to today’s bloated MIC. Napoleon lost a half million men in Russia. Etc. etc.

                “Churchill was a brilliant leader”
He was a good speaker and he had a sonorous voice. But that’s about it. If memory serves he was out of sync with the British establishment during the ’30s, which wanted a modus vivendi with Hitler.

                    No doubt Churchill disliked the Germans, but was he correct wrt to Hitler?  I say yes.  The “modus vivendi” mentioned seems to been a failure with Hitler pressing for more and more “concessions” while obviously breaking the terms of the WWI Treaty of Versailles and rearming.  As I said the other day, in hindsight, had the allies pressed Germany, i.e., Hitler, in the 30’s early on, WWII might never have happened.

                        Churchill’s mother was a j00ess.

[Don’t ask me WTF kinda kabbalah-istic symbolism the seven-pointed star was meant to symbolize.]
Here’s a picture of her with her two sisters:

They’re obviously j00esses.
The fambly was so j00ey that they hired a j00, named (((Stephen Heller))), to travel all the way across the Atlantic ocean simply to give her piano lessons in the New World.

                        Chamberlain was much more astute in his analysis of Germany in the interwar period. Churchill might have been correct about the threat of Hitler, but the biggest flaw in his thinking was ignoring the reality of the post-WWI European political dynamic. The root problem was that France wanted to treat Germany like a conquered territory but simply didn’t have the manpower to do so. In essence, the French basically expected Germany to pay reparations because that’s what the treated said, but simply didn’t have the political and military force to back it up if there was conflict. Chamberlain was correct in pushing for more equitable treatment of Germany because the political reality was that France was basically equal to Germany in manpower and production, so the peace agreement should reflect reality. The reality of Churchill’s bluster was that the English standard of living would have to drop the German standard of living to deal with the threat of Hitler. History is what it is, but an equitable, rather than punitive, peace treaty would have pretty much kept the Austrian painter on the fringe of politics, if not in the world of art.

                            No argument there wrt the “unfair” peace accords, however I’d say the French lacked will to enforce the treaty, not ability.  There was a time early 30’s when Germany had little of the might shown in 1940 to fight off a French invasion, but the French had cold feet and attempted to deter/protect via their famous Maginot Line.This lack of resolve on the part of the French was further shown in May of 1940.  The French were hit hard (in that short time frame lost about the same number of men as did the US in *all* of WWII), but when the British left, simply capitulated to the Germans—hence the quip of “cheese eating surrender monkeys” when referring to the French.Again, resolve shown years before would have quashed the whole war before it started.  It was simply a battle wills, which the French lost and the Germans—via Hitler—won.

                        “As I said the other day, in hindsight, had the allies pressed Germany, i.e., Hitler, in the 30’s early on, WWII might never have happened.”
But how would the “allies” ( Who were the “allies” in those years?) have pressed Hitler harder? Please make specific statements, not a speech.
If you suggest that Britain should have sent troops to Poland dissuade the Third Reich from annexing part of Poland, my reply is that the British Army was too weak to defeat the German army at that time. It would have been worse than the events of May 1940 for Britain.

                        He put us on a permanent war footing (we have been a war footing since about 1940). He vastly increased the size and scope of government. He appointed all 9 judges on the Supreme Court.  As you say, he created the GAE.If someone asked me “would you go back in time and kill baby Hitler” my answer would be, “No. I’d go back and kill Wilson, FDR, Churchill and Stalin”I suppose it is possible that all these forces were far bigger than 4 men and that the past is inescapable.  OTOH, it is hard to overstate the role these men played in shaping our modern world.

Where does the empire go next? Which is just another way of asking, who will be the world’s banker? Who will finish the transition to high tech? Nobody seems to want the ring, but somebody will end up with it, or the whole world takes several steps back.

                        You know, I thought the Asian wife thing was kind of a redneck fetish, but I’ve noticed a lot of Jews do that too, like Zuckerberg. Maybe they’re working their way east back to Khazaria.
And then there is that line of thinking about the fact that Jews got their money by intermarrying with WASPs. Maybe that’s what’s going on with the Asians. Mitch McConnell seems to have gotten on that train as well.

Right now, no one can think of a post-GAE financial “system” because they all have their hands in the till.  Yeah, collapse will be painful—for the dirt people, not the elites.  From what I hear our elites are getting rid of dollars for commodities (Bill Gates likes farm land I hear) so are countries like China (for gold).  If the current news be correct, I hear China has just bought/transacted oil for yuan—not dollars.

                Churchill is an interesting historical character. Apart from his stand against appeasement in the 1930s and his leadership in 1940, he got almost everything else wrong.

        People never have appreciated how close we are to nuclear annihilation. Throughout the Cold War, public discussion of a winnable nuclear war was verboten. Such insane musings have been commonplace of late. This Regime is in thrall to Neocon madmen and we are closer to nuclear war than ever thought possible. This is the cost of an alien and hostile elite able to bribe and cajole corrupt and stupid policymakers, and is a lesson for whoever comes next to never allow a certain tribe of intelligent but unhinged Bronze Age savages into their land.When the unthinkable begins to be reality, what will happen to that unshakable confidence that all it takes is one more escalation? Can the West accept defeat in Ukraine, or will they have no choice but to go bigger?There is no doubt as to the answers. Putin operated under the same delusions as Western Rightists that this cabal is not batshit crazy. All that ever was required is one serious punch in the mouth and either Antifa or the GAE immediately would have curled up into a fetal position and whimpered. The problem is those punches should have been delivered long ago. Now that the depth of the psychopathy and hubris are known, those who should have thrown punches years ago are hypersensitive and looking for one false move. The formerly restrained parties very well may react with all the power at their disposal when the lunatics lunge like the feminine bullies they are once again in expectation of no response.God help us. I have estimated the odds at more than fifty percent but at least some nuclear escalation almost is inevitable now.

At least in the 80s people were concerned about nuclear war and horrified at the prospect of it breaking out.
Now, if people talk about nuclear holocaust it’s the same tone as a sportsball game or Sunday BBQ. It’s sickening.

                The Cold War kept a lot of guardrails up and injected some sense of stewardship and responsibility into decision makers.  It didn’t hurt that most American leaders had WWII military experience well into the 80s.
Now we’re ruled by people who are delusional, alien and have never suffered any kind of consequence.

                    Conversing with my wife about Ukraine and Russia I was about to say, “I don’t want to alarm you but the outcome of all this could be devastation for everybody involved … .” The words died on my lips. Could I honestly tell her not to be alarmed when I am near petrified? Of course we don’t want people we care about being deeply upset, but at times telling the truth as we perceive it may be the better course.The Cold War kept a lot of guardrails up and injected some sense of stewardship and responsibility into decision makers. It didn’t hurt that most American leaders had WWII military experience well into the 80s.That’s right. The U.S. juggernaut hasn’t fought an equally strong opponent since WWII, or Korea of you want to stretch a point, referring not to N. Korea but Communist China. (North Vietnam? Itsmilitaryforce wasn’t what eventually drove us to give up.)No, our boys and girls and now half-and-halfs in uniform enforcedpax americanaby bullying comparative weaklings (Afghanistan, Iraq, etc.) in conventional-warfare terms. We were the kid who ate a box of Wheaties and fancied himself a baseball Hall of Famer. And so our blustering neocon psychopaths think we’re invincible come what may. They can’t imagine our proverbial irresistible force meeting … y’know.

The president is an impotent figurehead, and probably has been since the end of WWII. The wages of a foreign elite in control of policy are proving quite high.

                    6 minutes or 60 minutes, makes no difference.  The planning has always been to be able to sustain a “first strike” and retaliate with adequate—and terminal—response to the USSR.  As long as one leg of the deterrent triad remains.  As far as I know, our sub fleet remains viable in today’s environment to retaliate after a first strike.  A Ohio class,Trident II sub has 24 missiles (MIRVs) that each split into 8 independently targeted nukes.  The “throw weight” in megatons is astronomical.  192 nukes should be enough to take out every population center of Russia and then some.  We have more than one Trident II Ohio class sub—between USA and GB, 14 of these monsters last I checked.Fun fact: the US Navy names their sub’s after US cities.  The first or so of these monsters of mega death rolling off the “assembly line” was to be commissioned the “Corpus Christi” (Body of Christ) after that city in TX we all love.  The s**t hit the fan so to speak and the sub was renamed officially “The *City* of Corpus Christi”.  😉    I, being somewhat of an old school fiery Christian, always thought the original name was pretty good and in keeping with our tradition.

                        Indeed.  We’ll blow them all to hell.
Small problem:  The US only has about 50 missiles capable of intercepting ICBMs.
They’re 50% effective.  At best.
The whole war is over for both sides in a few hours.

                        Maybe. But the Russians have shown themselves to be vastly superior in the field of missile technology. It’s inconceivable that they haven’t applied this superiority to their nuclear capabilities as well. Russia would suffer badly, but the West would probably come off worse. Also, with the aforementioned missile superiority, the Russians have a much greater ability to take out our “leaders”. If push comes to shove, let’s hope they are the ones who die and that most of us plebs survive.

                All that on the pretext of perpetuating obvious lies such as the preamble of the Constitution. Who can be so confused that he denies the prudence of winding down the USA? The replacements ought to be discouraged from having any loyalty to the DC and the so-called “States”. Decolonize Hawai’i. Let Mexico absorb California if it can. And so on. If any portion of the USA endures, it ought to be no more than a toothless sliver of land between the Appalachians and the Atlantic Ocean, Florida excepted.

            I doubt it.  I have confidence Putin will manage this without nuclear escalation.  I most certainly do not believe things would go from 0 to 100 (where 0 is no nukes and 100 is strategic nuclear weapons use) in a very short period of time.
What is possibly concerning is if Xi decides that now would be a good time to take care of Taiwan and open the Asia theater.  But there are serious doubts that China is anywhere near ready for such an operation or that it will be in the near future.

                    Yes, but this is why I think it is important to recognize that we won’t go from 0 to 100 in a matter of hours or even days.  Using strategic nuclear weapons means all of the ground based ICBMs go up, up and away. This is full scale, hundreds if not thousands of nuclear weapons being launched and the end of Western Civilization.

                “I have confidence Putin will manage this without nuclear escalation.”
He’s not the one who has been escalating. It’s the US and its Europe satellites that have. Putin has been reacting. If the West continues escalating, he will continue reacting — maybe up to the nuclear level. If he does just remember who to blame.

                    It takes two to tango.  I just don’t see Putin sleepwalking into strategic nuclear stockpile exchange.
Russian nuclear doctrine is out in the open. They have a no first use nuclear posture, at least as far as strategic nuclear weapons are concerned.  While the US does not have a no first strike policy, I really don’t see them using them first.  These people understand what a strategic nuclear exchange would mean.  Their cushy lives would be over and they know it, probably better than anyone else.

        For decades during the Cold War, strong, brilliant men put their all into finding a balance into defending us against communism without starting WWIII. It’s a sign of how far and fast we’ve declined that we seem to have a bunch of grifters and blithering idiots simply blundering us into it out of pride, arrogance, and stupidity.

        I’m always fond of watching videos of idiotic tourists getting too close to bears and buffalo and receiving a quick lesson the danger of wild animals. The arrogance and stupidity of these tourists is startling.
NATO is like those tourists, poking the Russian Bear. I hope they don’t find that bears don’t like to be bothered.
The war is done and a negotiated settlement is the only way to avoid more bloodshed, which our demonic rulers apparently love.

        “Making Macron the first visit suggests the Chinese know he is a simpleton who is easily flattered, but also the driving force for escalation in Ukraine.“What the Chinese could offer the Europeans is a way out of the trap they have built for themselves with the Russians. They can get to pretend to be important figures by cutting a deal with China to end the war in Ukraine. Of course, this would mean breaking with Washington, so it is a long shot.”The Russians have been offering conciliatory ways out to the Europeans and Americans for years to no avail. Flattering the fork-tongued Macron will probably not serve any purpose — Macron, Sergeant Scholz, and Sunak are all bum boys of the US.On a side note, my admiration and respect for the restraint and patience for Putin and Xi is matched only by contempt and disdain for Western “leaders” like Biden, Sunak, Scholz, and Macron. If there is a nuclear war I hope these scumbags get wiped out first.

            I think the Chinese are hoping to avoid a sanctions war right now, so they are courting the Europeans to slow down that process. They know what the Russians know and that is the war in Ukraine ends with the end of Ukraine. Even so, it is worth the jet fuel to try and drive a wedge between Europe and Washington. That wedge is France.

                The thought that China might be able to broker a deal is the first ray of hope I have seen in this mess.  With everyone in the West is obviously bat-shit crazy.  It is up to a serious country like China to talk sense.   This is something to be very much wished for.

                Interesting to note the interplay between Katharina von Der Leyen and Macron. She’s obviously been assigned to him as a minder to make sure he doesn’t stray too far. Macron just announced France is not at war with Russia/Russian people and she all but contradicted him after both met with the Chinese foreign secretary. Remember when she flew with Macron to Beijing and Xi kicked her out and met only with Macron?
Don’t know what exactly, but there is a rift opening there.

                How? The terminal disease called egalitarianism, that’s how. In the mad rush to engineer Potemkin equality, all brilliance and greatness are crushed as a matter of course, while stupidity and incompetence are promoted, particularly if the stupid and incompetent are Hutus, deviants, and Persons of Vulva. A civilization programmed by a deranged ideology produces a demented power structure.

        The answer to the question of “what next” is to be found in the video I posted yesterday showing Biden shitting his pants while walking from the White House to Marine One. You can see the embarrassment of Jill Biden in the background while Biden coyly smiles with the release of his bowels. This is the symbolic archetype of the pseudo Mafiosi Tough Guy leading the Deep State and its EU minions.
What does it mean? The West will blink and back down.

        I see the Ukraine war as a continuation of the Afghan war, which was simply about raping the American taxpayer on behalf of the transnational security state under the propaganda pretext of war.  There’s a reason Ukraine began only six months after the end of Afghanistan.  Julian Assange said it best in this 30 second clip here:

Both Russia and Ukraine are controlled by higher powers pursuant to the below chart:

The war really can’t be properly understood except in this context…

            The chart is poorly designed and obtuse but it is entirely accurate. Assange had it right, too: money is being stripped from American and European taxpayers and laundered to foreign elites, who then convert the fiat into hard assets. They are anticipating the dollar cratering even if there are no signs to support that just yet.

        The madness stops when Americans throw the neocons out. Not making the mistake of overestimating people. Even normie seems to think life is a game. Normie just wants to eat, get drunk, and be entertained, so I can’t imagine what it’s like in the clouds. I think people with a say are still capable of contacting reality, especially at the brink, but the question is if they still have the guts for it, or if they’re content to go out as a bunch of losers partying to the end.

        “Even so, it is enough of a fig leaf for the Russians to pretend they are not NATO soldiers.”And this is Russia’s conundrum. It’s clear they do not want to escalate, so they grant Nato all these little freebies and concessions (on what is and isn’t an actual combatant.) The problem is that the leadership in the West being what it is, views each concession as an invitation to push the boundary a little further until next thing they know they’re chest deep in the quicksand (aka the Russian war machine) and that when the panic starts: flailing their arms about (or reaching for big red buttons to push).I can only hope that history remembers Russia as the side of reason and Nato/globohomo as the insane ones.Lastly, part of me wishes Biden (or whoever) sends a few divisions of negroes, mestizos, homos, and trannies over there, because they will likely never return.

                I agree. I was in the Navy in the 70’s when nuclear war with the USSR was an every day possibility. We had weekly drills on what to do in case of war and it pretty much consisted of bend over and kiss your ass goodby. Since the Soviet collapse the reality of war has faded into collective memory and a new generation has had their ideas of WW3 framed by video games and TV shows where plucky survivors hammer out a new civilization. Sorry folks, that’s not reality. In a mass retaliation event(MRE) + 10 years the fertility rate for the 35% who survive radiation poisonings (these are 1970’s numbers) will never be up to replacement rates, so in about MRE +100 years basically the age of man is gone.

This.  Its why the escalation is partly Putin’s fault.  Earlier declarations of red lines, and then doing nothing when they were crossed, has created a real dilema.
Its best to never declare a red line.  If they enemy crosses one, simply react.  That lets the other side know you are serious, and that they are in a “fuck around and find out” situation.

        I do not think any of the world leaders think WW3 is right around the corner, but they all have huge incentives in convincing the world that it is.The U.S. and NATO leaders can use the threat of WW3 to justify extending and expanding their money laundering enterprises.Putin is about to start his 5th term and is more popular in Russia than ever.Xi Jinping is the most influential diplomat in the world and China benefits from being able to trade freely with both sides.I feel about WW3 much the same way I felt about Covid. They may all be competitors/enemies, but they all have powerful incentives to cooperate to keep the fear going.

        Let’s not forget that the Biden Cabal desperately needs a distraction right about now. They keep show trialing Bad Orange Man, and his popularity keeps going up. They’re going to have to Fortify the almighty hell out of the election no matter what, but it’s about to get ludicrous. And then there’s the fact that they actually published the League Table of the Progressive Stack — what Covid was to medicine (the own goal to end all own goals), the hamfisted response to college Hamas protests is to the rest of the Apparat.The Biden Junta really is stupid and shortsighted enough to believe that a nice neat little war is just the thing to get everybody back onside. We’ll all rally ’round the flag, because ‘Murrica — fuck yeah!! (Sadly, plenty of Grillers and Normies really will, but as their average age is north of 50 they won’t be of much military use).

        Republican party is suffering from a spiritual crisis. It has become a giant grifting machine that churns out slogans and collects money. It stands for no value and allows lockdowns, death-shot mandates, J6 political prisoners rotting in jail, burning cities, but always ‘stands for our greatest allies” in Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan and worries about “the left destroying our country”.
I do not think the situation is sustainable. The spiritual battle between Christians and anti-Christians will come to the fore sooner or later.

        This is like wondering if they will come to their senses and stop with the BS attacks on Trump and acting like insane tyrants.Not gonna happen. They’d rather America burn than let the people elect Trump. They made that rather clear during Covid, didn’t they?In the same manner, they’d rather have nuclear WW3 unless Putin (and the rest of the world, but especially Putin), comes and bows before them or takes a knee, they seem to like that gesture the best.In any matter, I have no doubt that they are willing to destroy humanity and maybe the Earth rather than not get their way on everything or having someone they don’t like being in power. They are that petty.They hold the whole world hostage, basically and the world is getting sick of it, with good reason. They are nuts!

            Exactly. It is the same dynamic–psychotic hubris. The current CIA director was Obama’s ambassador to Moscow. He told American officials not a single political faction in Russia would accept NATO membership for Ukraine. He obviously is being ignored. There certainly must be “Biden” advisors telling his handlers to lay off the astonishingly vulgar and ham-handed lawfare. They also are being ignored even as “Biden” becomes weaker.
It is truly dangerous. There is little doubt they will burn down the world if they don’t get a pony.

        Looking at People Magazine for Davos, aka the FT, it looks like the Plan, such as it is, would be conscription and massive human waves against the Russians to create a North / South Korea situation. A “Frozen Conflict” that allows them to claim a win.That at least is the plan. The reality is that any such mobilization in Europe and the US has serious costs. In Germany, France, and the UK having most (White) military men away at the front (let us just imagine it happens) would pretty much guarantee an uprising of the Aloha Snackbar variety to establish a Snackbar regime. Russia would certainly help plan and instigate that — the Snackbars are broadly aligned with Russia and against the Euro regimes. Here in this country we would see the stuff aimed at the Met Gala yesterday times 1000.Yes the bureaucrats are slobbering over Wartime rationing, controls, etc. for a total wartime economy, but we don’t have the slack industrial capacity of 1940 — we have the pretendian Louis Vuitton luxury boutique manufacturing of luxury missiles that cannot scale up. Rather than cratering Russia’s economy it would crater ours which is already precarious depending on China for most manufacturing. Most retail, fast food, entertainment, consumer vehicle manufacturing, and more would simply cease to exist in Wartime controls.We don’t have the men to send — not regular army, not conscripted. We don’t have the supplies including small arms at scale to send with the men. We don’t have the ability to supply them across an ocean nor the shipping capacity. We don’t have the air defense to protect our supply depots in Europe from hypersonic missiles. The F-16 our mainstay still is good for shooting down drones and cruise missiles non-hypersonic at $2 million per Sidewinder missile. But once they are out they are out — no resupply. No pilot training programs at scale. It just is not sustainable so they will absolutely do this.The massive failure of the US/NATO in Ukraine assuming it can avoid nuclear escalation is likely to produce regime change across the board in the West. As people see how weak and useless the regime really has become.

        Maybe they take control of Odessa and dare the Russians to attack.
I’ve had that thought, that deploying NATO troops to Odessa would salvage what rump state might be left while fortifying their own regime in Ukraine.  It would also free up a bunch of troops that could be sent to the front (in theory).  The limiting factor though is that the logistics of the situation would be pretty horrible.

        There’s strategic advantage for Russia to wait until the election.  If Trump prevails, no WW3.  If Trump loses or is overthrown, we get some weird version of WW3, but 1/2 of America refuses to comply.  Russia takes out our enemies for us or the Government Party launches an unpopular war and risks Americans shooting at them instead of the Russians.
Whites, who have been discouraging military service, will likely react violently to a draft.

                Trump has repeatedly promised to end the war in Ukraine “in 24 hours”.  That’s not something he can easily be  manipulated out of.  I do think the CIA and DOS will disobey orders.  Military action may be required against both agencies.

Can you imagine the US holding negotiations with Russia and China while they full well know that our government is staging a Color Revolution aimed at destroying the country?
How could you even be taken seriously by rivals? Seems like a total pushover just at the time that our Empire is falling.

        I am not a fan of the posture of the Claremont guys. However, their understated analysis indicates that the GAE’s hand to play is extremely weak. They imply that Ukraine falling will drive the Europeans away from the GAE. A) The GAE brought them along and the EU got nothing more than a terrible economy and a very terrible draining of industry from Germany that they may not recover from. B) The GAE’s hand is so weak on so many fronts that the EU gynocrats walk away from Washington and figure the Eurasian alliance is a better deal from them.It looks like Blinken doing his best Muddy Waters performances won’t be enough to entice the GAE’s allies to stick around.Things could go haywire one way or the other once Ukraine falls officially.I pray that the young Frenchmen, Englishmen, and American men turn away from the regimes in droves. Why fight for a hostile ruling regime that is dumping the third world into your homelands and using your money to do it. I hope the emerging crisis for the falling GAE precipitates the opportunities needed for reclamation of homelands and sovereignty in them. It is going to be a rough ride.Look for the GAE gynocracy to fold and eventually negotiate terms that cede control to China. Perhaps forces in the Levant are behind the scenes negotiating their way into being in control of the American satrapy.In the meantime, this article explains how and why diversity is so important in our Congress. Cori Booker is slobbering all over Karp and the boys. Searching around, it isn’t just Palmer Luckey who has moved into Silicon Valley moving in as the defense contractors of the future. You have Karp and Eric Schmidt is going full steam ahead on his cartel of defense contractors. I bet SV is going to run the Propaganda and Digital Opiate system as well as control the military technology.As promised this article is short but extremely illuminating as to why Cori Booker, Kyrsten Synema (sp?) and their ilk must have representation in Congress. Karp and Co will steamroll this cadre of sub-midwits. As more diversity floods into Congress and statehouses, it will only be Our Strength if you are a part of the SV info-military-tech cartel.Things are heating up.https://responsiblestatecraft.org/defense-tech-startups/

        Did anyone else watch the recent Paul Craig Roberts interview on Dialogue Works? I normally don’t own with PCR, but he is the only one who has been saying the things I’ve been saying regarding the Ukrainian War. Too many people in the alternative space are uncritically adopting the views of The Duran,viz.that Russia’s time-biding approach to SloMo works in their favor. I do not agree with that. I think that the key to de-escalation is destroying the Ukrainian government and that Zelensky and Kiev should have been targeted long ago.

            One reason Russia did not send a million man army into Ukraine is they did not have one to send. PCR simply does not understand what Russia has been doing for the last two years. The transition from battalion to division level organization, for example, is not something you do in a week. Training  700,000 new soldiers and revamping your military to handle tens of new volunteers every month takes time. Then you have the technological revolution on the battlefield to contend with for which there are no ready answers.

            I don’t entirely disagree. There are noises about pivoting to Klitschko, but that is difficult because Zelensky has been built up as the face of Ukraine.
I’m less in tune with theDuranthan I used to be. It’s tiresome listening to Mercouris get the vapors because he can’t grok the idea we are headed for nuclear war.

                The Russians will not deal with any of the Ukraine leaders now. Once they officially labeled them as criminals, that was the end of any chance for these guys to escape alive. Russia is a legalistic place. Unlike the West, they take their rules seriously. Once they officially labeled these guys as criminals, there is no negotiating with them.I suspect we may see a coup this month. Zelensky’s term officially ends May 20. I can see the ultranationalists launching a coup attempt, which may explain why those unites have refused to be thrown into various meat grinders. On the other hand, I can see other factions rising up to dump Zelensky hoping to cut a deal with the Russians. The gas Princess comes to mind.

It’s impossible these days to amass the kind of forces needed for his kind of action without it being destroyed a long time before it reaches the point of concentration.

        So let’s say for the sake of discussion that (((they))) have made a deal with the Orange Man to allow him to be president again, in return for support of our Greatest Ally. Which I find quite plausible. The question is whether or not this would include his support for continuing the suicidal “strategy” re: “Ukraine.” Perhaps it does not. Israel does not appear to care a whole lot about Ukraine.What I’m getting at is voting harder, while not a solution for all or even many problems, could actually be the thing to save us from war with Russia. If armageddon or ruinous escalation can be delayed past November.

                I think you miss his point – if OMB agrees to drop Uke to focus on helping Israel genocide the Palis, maybe our Zionist rulers allow him to be Pres.  That seems to explain OMB’s rhetoric of late – signaling he would make such a deal.

                Israel never provided Ukraine with weapons
Jews in Israel licensed production of Tavor rifles to Ukrainians, and Azov battalion members got their hands on some of those. This scandalized a few “human rights” Jews in Israel who protested to their government. It so happened also that Ukrainians obtained Israeli armoured vehicles through some surreptitious route intended to preserve plausible deniability in Israel.

        Can somebody help the slow kids out?
The war nerds I listen to are using terms I am unfamiliar with. There is supposedly the doctrine of “Combined Arms Warfare that was supposedly perfected by the Germans in WW2, and adopted by the Allies after the war. Supposedly there is a new doctrine of something called “Integrated Arms Warfare” – and the Russians have mastered it while Globohomo still functions under obsolete military paradigms.
Do any of you fellas know what Integrated Arms Warfare is? And what the difference between the two terms is…?

            forgot to add the precision strike aspect of it (another outcome of integrating satellite communication and microprocessor-programmed control of the hypersonic weapons).

        I think the worst possible outcome to the Ukraine war from the point of view of the neocons would be a Chinese-mediated peace settlement.  If that happens, China would be a factor in not only the Mideast (the Saudi Arabia-Iran reestablishment of diplomatic relations) but also in eastern Europe.

        As much as I hate to say it, Europeans being “our people.”On its face it would seem smart for Europe to lean in towards China, since the GAE has used Europe as a political pawn to squeeze Russia and payed a heavy price for it. Europe has suffered more economic / political strife than Russia caused by the U.S. sanctions.Especially regarding fuel.China is the world’s manufacturer, the U.S. produces nothing of value the Europeans can’t get anywhere else including China. The only thing Europe needs form the GAE is its military. China could offer as much foreign aid as the GAE.Where it could turn out to be a bad move for Europe is if China’s intentions are to use a velvet glove approach to gain Europes favor, then after weakening U.S. influence in Europe, tighten its grip on Europe. Europe is between the proverbial rock and a hard place.Trump 2024!

            About 40 years ago Gore Vidal predicted a future where China would rule the world, the US would be its farm, and Europe its boutique.  Not looking bad as a prediction but he seems to have thought the USSR would just collapse into nothing.  Not unreasonable, that was on track,  but then Putin happened.  Well, as a wise man once said, predictions are always risky, especially about the future.

        When viewed in a certain light, the Ukraine adventure is an uptick in Neocon strategy. It’s a lot like Tom Sawyer charging the kids (Europeans) to whitewash his fence. Conversely, it shows the epic stupidity of this generation of European politicians. In the old days, the US paid for everything.

        The insanity among Western “leaders” is breath-taking. They have learnt nothing from the last two years. There is a palpable sense too that the Russians have had enough of being taunted and talked down to by people like Macron and Cameron. I live in Europe and have a family, but I almost – almost – hope they do take out some relevant targets here just to teach them a lesson.

        It would be a really long shot and if it ever happens Washington will probably take it as a declaration of war.

            It’s a great book, but I’d rather die in a Global Nuclear Holocaust than watch Lex Fridman.

        2 days ago (Orthodox Easter) Zelensky announced that Ukrainians are G-d’s chosen people.I have a confirmation for Zelensky: yes, G-d chose them for annihilation, according to His promise to Abraham: “I’ll curse those who curse you”.Ukrainians did unspeakable cruelty to Jews for 200 years, but could not be punished before they became a nation for the first time in their history in 1991.

            You mean “unspeakable” retaliation against abusive Shemitic supremacists who never needed to establish colonies in Europe.Now let’s think about the first person singular pronoun in the quoted passage. Was it not inserted by spiteful priests of the master priesthood nation? Israel, you see, has been narcissism on stilts since its obscure beginnings, and this crybully is nothing if not a vindictive fool. The god, a literary character, speaks for the priesthood (of no authority) and its loyalists.Be of good cheer, though, hannahless one. It will be all over for the master nation, Israel, within just over 200 years. Meanwhile, dwell on the fact that shamayim is imaginary, as Apollo reminded anyone who was paying attention about 55 years ago in December 1968. k’vod shamayim, therefore, is childish superstition. The destiny of Israel is to fade away to nothing like fog in morning sunshine.

                If you read the Bible, much of it is about God punishing Israel for disrespecting Him. Why would they (Jews) leave all that stuff in there for thousands of years if it wasn’t true? The Bible does not exactly paint Jews in a good light (or any of us – none of us non-Jews are any better). I don’t believe priests or anyone else inserted stuff.Also remember that the Arabs (descendants of Ishmael) also share in God’s blessing as a “great nation”.Here’s an interesting channel:MiniPix US V53 16×9 VO1 (youtube.com)

                    Why would they (Jews) leave all that stuff in there for thousands of years if it wasn’t true?That material was added by clever guys who had some understanding that their posterity would stray from the plan for world domination (Pslams 2, Isaiah 66) and so need to correct their course. Military men are capable of the same thinking, but they are in most cases still just foolish brutes, at least in western Europe, N. America, and, of course, Israel.All Bibles reek of origins among common, fallible beings. They have a multitude of errors including bad geography and cosmology (shamayim is imaginary), bad anatomy (the heart is just a blood pump), bad politcs, nationalist narcissism, and, most importantly, egoism (Ex. 3:14) elevated to a supreme principle of existence. So why are these errors perpetuated? The ideologues of Israelism are basically the same as any other ideologues. They’re pig headed, but these ideologues produce many children. It’s also possibly true that every possible arrangement of matter is necessary in some world, but this is a topic for another blog.

            So good.  Bone-chilling accurate, a perfect example of what is spoken in the prophecies.This is why the Christians will never see the meaning of things in the same way,Thank you Anna dear.Now, from BigCountry’s point of view (an American military blogger):“Recently there was a vidya circulating out there of Two Recruiting Commissars who were forced to dig their own graves, and then got blasted by Farmer Petrovich with a 12 gauge.There’s also another one of a bunch of Romani (gypsies) storming a Recruitment Center to ‘rescue’ one of their own who got snatched up off the street… they destroyed the office, and beat the ever-loving fuck out of the CommissarsAnother factoid: Seems the majority of the Commissars are of a particular tribal affiliation. Who’d a’thunk it?”
