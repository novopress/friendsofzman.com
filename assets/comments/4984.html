        I love that he used the overrated Mad Men show as a exemple of this failed system, Mad Men isn’t really about the glory days of WASP America.

        I bang on about this a lot, but the ideal is Al-Beeb. The BBC’s license fee is enshrined in the nation’s law: you have to pay for the state propaganda machine whether you watch it or not, and the penalty is a hefty fine or even jail.Better still, the organisation once foolishly called ‘Auntie’ gets to levy their tax on anyone who buys a television set, or a device capable of receiving BBC’s mostly left-wing output. Even if you bought an old telly to use as a bookend you get a semi-threatening letter within days, warning you of the dire consequences of not having a licence. (When my daughter went to Uni and we bought her a TV and a licence, the ‘authorities’ made small error on the address of where the TV was to be placed. As a new student at the university, she didn’t immediately register on the paid license list and so she got the cursory warning letter. Actually, she got three  before we sorted it out.)From Al-Beeb’s point of view, they get a guaranteed income even if the viewer watches everything but the BBC. No wonder Al-Beeb shit bricks whenever anyone mentions a change in the funding method, usually making them rattle on about ‘quality’ programming at risk while quietly ignoring that they couldn’t wait to kick the highly popular but politically incorrect Top Gear into touch.They also feel the need to grab a share of monies involved in internet provision. It hurts them to have their stuff watched for free.

            I was only vaguely familiar with it.  I am quite sure 99% of Americans are wholly unaware.This shocked me:  “…..Since 1 April 2010 the annual licence fee has been £145.50 for colour and £49.00 for black and white.”That’s twice as much as my car registration, and I live in California!Man…you guys lurched full totalitarian-socialist after the War  (Though I admit the direct effects, piled upon the even greater devastation a generation earlier, were many times greater than we dealt with stateside, to be sure.)Somehow knowing this actually LESSENS the genius of Orwell for me.  You didn’t have to be some great savant in the late 40s.  All you needed do was step outside, look around and put pen to paper.   Heck…that’s just a good parlor trick.   LOL

                Supposedly Britain in the mid-forties, freed of the burden of war, swiftly voted socialism in because — according to some — the nation was tired of ‘the warmonger Churchill.’ Well, that’s convenient left-wing view for while Churchill may not have made great peacetime Premier, he was far better than the envious, hypocritical loons Labour dredged up with all their nationalisation plans. Churchill wasn’t PM when war broke out in ’39 so it was hard to see how he could be blamed, but blame is always the mainstay of the left so no surprise there.As for the size of the licence fee, Al-Beeb love it but always want more. The only good thing is multiple TVs in one house only require one licence fee for the whole home, but I bet that irks Auntie no end.

        That’s why the big urban mono-dailies got as jacked as they are. They were monopolistic content bundlers as well but for in depth news as opposed to the more superficial crap you got on TV or the radio. Where else were you going to get box scores or some vague clue of what was going on in congress or the state house circa 1985.

        In addition to receiving programming to display to the viewer, most cable TV boxes send data back to the cable operator, including a serial number for the particular set-top box; the cable operator knows how many households, and exactly which households, are watching any given program at any given time. The revenues they send back to the content providers (a particular cable channel that is) is dependent on those viewership numbers. In turn, the cable channels pay revenues to each show’s production company.So there may be quite a bit of cross-subsidy going on, but there is also a lot of money being paid sort of directly to each show’s producers, based on the actual viewership.All of your viewing history is available to the cable companies; every time you switch channels, the cable company knows. You are never watching anything on cable anonymously. The revenue models depend on that.

            That’s not how it works in America. ESPN, for example, get $7 a month from every cable home whether they watch or not.
