        Wow, I though the Cruz/CFR connection was only floating around the conspiracy sites like INFOWARS.  Looks like POLITICO figured it out:http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1011/A_pit_of_vipers_also_his_wife.html
Cruz is the biggest of frauds.  He recently told a crowd of Jewish donors that he “was not all that conservative”.  He very publicly threw the Middle Eastern Orthodox Christians, an imperiled minority that has been in existence long before Muhammad crawled out of his cave, because he needs Sheldon Adelson’s bucks to run for President.  The conservative cultists who have been drooling over this guy are going to be shocked if he ever achieves real power.

        I’ve predicted for the last year that once Obama commits to executive amnesty, the next shoe to drop will be a border security bill.  Sure enough:http://rt.com/usa/211611-republicans-immigration-border-bill/When that passes, Manchurian Conservative Ted Cruz, who despite all his rhetoric is in accord with the leadership on immigration, and who’s wife, as member of the Council of Foreign Relations, was a member of a task force advocating for the North American Union (http://www.cfr.org/canada/building-north-american-community/p8102), will pronounce himself satisfied.  At that point, some version of the Gang Of 8 immigration bill will be passed, and Obama’s executive action will be codified by Congress into law.
