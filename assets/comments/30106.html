Hey, hey, there, Bub. Did you fail to remember that this is Pride Month? It’s the “United States of Anal Sodomy” and don’t you forget it.

                        The Z-Man: “The people who run the government are all hired men with the time horizon of hired men. None of them have ever built anything or even left footprints on the beach. The point of their existence is to never be tied to anything, so they can flit from one opportunity in the system to the next opportunity, building the resume for the next job.”Structurally speaking, the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, passed during the administration of Chester Arthur, has played a near-omnipotent role in all of this.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendleton_Civil_Service_Reform_ActBut reading the Wikipedia history [likely filled with revisionist propaganda] makes it difficult to draw a perfect analogy with current events.It looks like one of Jimmy Carter’s very last initiatives [before leaving office in January of 1981] was the gutting of the “Professional and Administrative Careers Examination (PACE)”, which was at the heart of the merit-based system.The argument was that PACE was “racially discriminatory as a result of the lower average scores and pass rates achieved by Black and Hispanic test takers”.Wikipedia also indicates that, in the current day, only about 10% of all federal workers lack lifetime sinecures.The other 90% are almost impossible to fire.Muh guess is that Arthur &amp; the GOP were anticipating the rise of a post-Reconstruction Democrat Party, and were solidifying their political sinecures in anticipation of the inevitable return of the Democrat Party [s/p Reconstruction].Indeed, a few years later, Grover Cleveland won the first of his two presidencies, and likely would have sacked yuge percentages of all GOP civil servants, but instead was stymied by Pendleton.The supreme irony now is that many folks have compared Trump to Cleveland, and arguably Trump [in his first administration] faced precisely the same psycho-sociological obstructions as did Cleveland.

        We didn’t hire President Trump to run the organization, we hired him to drain the swamp, which, as the saying goes, is hard to do when you’re ass deep in alligators.
Yep the swamp’s still there but because of him, far more folks can’t help but see and smell it now.
I don’t have high hopes for the nation, nor for civilization for that matter, but I’m willing to hire, once burned President Trump again to slow down the fall.

            His first presidency only inspired them to greater furor. Accelerating clown world. Multiply that for the second one, if it were allowed to happen. The danger of civil war doesn’t come from a disgruntled right. We have amply demonstrated that we will lie down and take it. It comes from an enraged left that absolutely will not accept a second Trump presidency, and they will have all the backing the cathedral can give them.
Maybe we should get it over with. I won’t argue with that. But we should be very clear about what we’re getting into.

        Zman, suggest you expand your Gab post regarding de-weaponization of the DoJ into a full post here. I’m always dumbfounded when I speak with conservatives who push for de-politicizing the government (as if it’s possible), and their knee-jerk reaction when I state that the proper response is not to de-politicize, but to implement an activist, right-leaning government policy when we’re in power. Throw lefties in jail, hang some of their leaders, go after the business interests of their financiers, etc.This is one explanation for the ratchet effect of government policy. They move the ball down the field. We take a knee for four downs, then return to defense where they left the ball on the field.

        Kind of off topic but kind of on: I used to puzzle over how Trump managed to run economic policy, (i.e trade sanctions on China) while he apparently wasn’t allowed to run anything else. That is, if the permanent regime had denied him everything else, which it had,  how did he manage to get his grasp on that?And the answer, as shown by the Biden admins harsher sanctions on China, is that he didn’t. That was the GAE agenda all along. Trump’s economic people were globohomo’s economic people. Bear in mind that Mnuchin and Soros have a lot of history together.I don’t think Trump was every really president at all. He was just a guy living in the White House tweeting. Who sold a few pardons on his way out the door.

                The last two anyway
I think there are certain initiatives they need a president to sign off on that Trump wouldn’t sign. That was the rub. Whereas Biden will sign anything they want. They can do a lot of things without presidential permission, most things, but not everything. Of course any initiatives of Trump’s own were pretty much DOA, unless they involved letting black people out of jail.

                The power of the presidency isn’t a magic wand, but it still exists. Somebody with the brains and the cajones and the willingness to actually do something with the job, could use the bully pulpit and get something accomplished.
Trump just wasn’t interested in all that heavy lifting, and he also never understood the historical and cultural forces that elected him. He thought it was all about himself.

        “The resume of the Washington man is a list of places and people with whom he has a connection. Where you are and who you are with is what matters in Washington.” – which is why they can never be “made the fool of.”  For all Trump’s thousands of shortcomings, he was good at that, which is why they hate him so much.  If your resume is your work, you have no talent.  You are a talentless hack with an easily dented ego.  The more talent you have, the more you don’t care about being made the fool of because you know you have the brains to back up your life and lifestyle.  Some of the most talented people actually enjoy being made the fool of.  They would have loved to have been roasted by Don Rickles, which is basically the act Trump was putting on.Nuland and Blinken, like their thousands of underlings, are made of crepe paper.  The minute you point out their lack of genius, you have serious problems.  The swamp is a swamp of petty, untalented narcissists.

        “…they do no work in the way in which people in the dreaded private sector think of it. The resume of the Washington man is a list of places and people with whom he has a connection. Where you are and who you are with is what matters in Washington.”In other words, these people are simply jackals feasting on the carcass of a dying empire and looting the profits of other people’s work. It’s like this everywhere — private sector, nonprofit sector, medicine, law, and academia, etc., not just in politics. Even the officer corps of the military is like this now.I found this out the hard way. I stupidly believed that the purpose of going to college was to study a specific body of knowledge important enough that others would pay me for it. Wrong! The purpose of college was to do bong hits in the frat house with the congressman’s sons so you could get appointed to a position in D.C., or to marry some sorority sister you were banging and then inherit her father’s business. I literally knew a dude who banged every chick in his dorm and ended up marrying a JAP and inheriting her dying father’s business. I met another dude as he was lighting a bowl of dope who later inherited his father’s trucking company. I’m sure all his Trump-voting drivers who do the actual work get piss-tested every month.Elites don’t go to college to learn anything. They go to college to make connections with people who are “somebody” socially and politically. The common denominator is that none of them do any real work — that’s for immigrants and Trump-voting white trash.“Work” for these people consists of hobnobbing and having the right social and political attitudes to fit in with the class of people who have the power to rip off someone else’s money and put it in their pockets.

            Very well said.  I would add a second reason for going to college.  It is a massively overvalued IQ and punctuality test you can hand to employers, who cannot legally check you for those things because they are racist.Modern universities are basically museums funded by taxes on students (through tuition), and taxpayers (through Pell grants and loans).  The university design is hundreds of years old, and was meant to train the top 10% in general studies to make them well-rounded leaders.  It was never meant to force accountants and engineers to waste years of their lives studying philosophy, history and literature.The whole system needs to be blown up, and replaced with two year professional trade schools for white collar jobs.  But those who are taxed to pay for the current structure have no political representation.

                An IQ test that shows you likely have a propensity for not thinking for yourself and that reflects how many practice exams your parents can force you to take.A University was originally the means to:a) permit long slow inquiry into historyb) exhange ideas and objective proof and use good faith argumentation to properly interpret that historyc) cultivate the arts and sciences and theologyd) preserve knowledgee) use all of the above to train elites so they could be prepared to be highly effective statesmen and/or highly effectively advise themf) Not be the sole means of education and training as aristocrats were also trained in martial arts; agriculture; arts and crafts …g) demonstrate competency through action that shows the skill can be performed wellh) be a very small and truly elite group of peopleWe turned college into technical training centers where very little of the technical training translates into the skills used on the job. Occasionally the pedigree of the institution says something about the ability and the utility of the ability of its degree holder. That seems to be inverting in many realms of pseudo-study and increasingly in realms of once serious study (law and now medicine)When corporate America concluded that St. George died, (they think he was murdered) because he and all blacks were not given white collar jobs and college degrees we saw how rotten to the core the Universities were. All of these managers are more identified with their alma maters than their country if they identify with their country at all.True story from a recent dinner with in-laws. The twerp whose balls live on his demonic wife’s closet shelf always brings up politics. I entered the dining room to a discussion on immigration. He had once before argued for giving illegals drivers licenses so that they could get insurance so if he got in an accident with one he could get paid by insurance. A real genius.This time his argument was, “Give me your tired, your poor …” In other words, a college educated man saying that a slogan on a statue place by an activist 100 years ago is how our system legislates. His even stupider wife claimed that the Republicans are causing the crisis by letting the migrants in and sending them to the cities.These are college educated people who live in an extremely prestigious enclave. A third grader has a better knowledge of civics than these people. They don’t think. They just see where the power lies and parrot what the power squawks at them.We must become the power. Then those who want to promote treason in the form of mass illegal immigration, must bear the consequences of doing so. First, we can teach them civics in middle school so they have a fair chance of not getting through college thinking slogans on statues are the law of the land and to avoid being in serious trouble with us for wanting to hand Oximel a driver’s license so he can get auto insurance on the one in a million chance he might get in a fender bender with you. (Opinion read in the NY Times brought to you by AllState)Perhaps, best solution is he shouldn’t be here to get in a fender bender with you. We can teach that kind of thinking in grammar school – save university for elite thinkers who do not have to be taught such basic and reasonable and easily drawn conclusions. (Teacher notes that little Twerpus will make a good and reliable worker but should not get the franchise, and, by all means, never let him near a University)

                    Recent college graduates seem to be full of “alternate facts.”
I did get civics in middle school. Maybe even elementary, can’t remember for sure. Was in the 80s. If I was one of the last ones to receive this, and I suspect I was, that would help explain a lot, wouldn’t it.

                    I had a similar discussion with a liberal friend of my wife.  She is a prosecutor in a county of about 2 million, so pretty intelligent (you would think).  Somehow we got on General Milley committing treason by promising China a heads-up of our top secret foreign policy strategies.  Her view was he had to do it because Trump is crazy, since she believes he threatened them with nuclear weapons.  I asked by what process a general can take over foreign policy when he thinks the president is crazy.  Well, you know, when it’s obvious like with Trump.  We moved on to my belief that the feds had people stirring up shit in the crowd on Jan 6.  She said that didn’t happen because Christopher Wray testified that it didn’t happen.  I will never talk politics with this woman again.  The parroting of MSNBC is off the charts, and these people never hear anything contradictory.

They never hear anything contradictory because they are TERRIFIED to hear anything contradictory.
(((The Narrative))) is their psychological security blanket.
Without (((The Narrative))), they would be psychologically naked, helpless in the face of the encroaching circle of psychological wolves [Truth Facts] enveloping them and preparing to devour them [psychologically].
They are psychological herd creatures.
The sunlit meadow is their home.

            As you experienced first hand, routine college admittance has morphed into one of the great brakes on social mobility.Even one generation ago, but especially two – three generations past, it was common for a doctor to marry a school teacher, nurse, or even homemaker whereas today, doctors are most likely to marry other doctors.  (Social mobility actually figured heavily into popular culture, as reflected in movies and much of TV dramas and comedy.)A glance at today’s society/weddings columns reads like “Match for Bureaucrats”. It seems like almost, to a one, every DC bureaucrat is married to a mirror image of itself.

                I have long been on record [for the better part of a decade now] warning that Ivy-League/Seven-Sisters styled selective mating would result in rapidly escalating preponderances &amp; statistical intensification of the genes for grotesque Personality Disorders.
As an example, one of the classical pairings in the psychological literature is {Narcissistic Male}x{Borderling Female}.
You go through four or five consecutive generations of those kinds of Personality Disorders mating with one another, and by the end of the Century, you could very likely be looking at outright sadistic psychopathy in the descendants.

            I posted something similar a few days ago, that all work above say the middle class layer of society is just socializing to advance oneself through connections and securing sinecures.  The highest class of professionals actually doing stuff would be something like doctors and engineers, but at that level they’re intermixed with the pretend workers.  Like an engineer will have to answer to a blue-hair whose job is to check their code for proper pronoun sensitivity.  Just like the frat guys you speak of, the blue-hairs don’t know anything either and just go to college to have the proper connections to secure a good do-nothing blue-hair job.

            Great comment and completely true. Hierarchies simply based on lucky birth, connections and backslapping work until they don’t, and then they implode. The United States is well down that road now. Further, the “elite” (laughable) surplus was on full display during Covid. We learned that you really don’t need four diversity directors no matter who their daddies are.

        This might be my naivete but some businesses being under state control might make them better as opposed to worrying about costs.
Disneyland sounds like a place that would be fun to enjoy of there was a 1000 person cap per day. That way it would be more enjoyable. You could also book years in advance to experience it.
The park would have to be owned by the state of California for it to function that way.

        The Japanese, at least (not sure about recently – they seem to have the same sort of economic betrayal problem as us, and not sure about China): They still have a bit of a feudal mindset.When an American company tells you to think of them as a “family”, they’re just cynically manipulating you in the most vomit-inducing manner. The Japanese might actually mean it in this weird extended-clan sort of way. You’ve been adopted into some distant-cousin/servant sort of position in  the XYZ clan. They’ll take care of you as one of their people, and you’ll take care of them. (And work yourself to death, and go to the 8PM on Friday office party, since these obligations go way beyond normal transactional boundaries.)In America, your family is your family, the company is just where you work for a living, and verbiage to the contrary is a con job to infringe on your boundaries.

            Yes. But there are the American globalist companies that entice you with overflowing cupboards of candy, candy posing as health food, catered breakfast, lunch and dinner, laundry and car services … …You can tell the bugmen because they get these jobs and tout these perks as if they are some special person who has been conferred a bonanza. All that is is the confession of an infantalized person who likes life with Mommy and a cupboard full of treats who takes those crumbs in exchange for working very long hours. For the few whose 18 hour days translate into huge sums for the company and thus bonuses and high stock valuations that they themselves can use to buy time back, that is a bargain worth striking. For the low-level person who deludes themselves into thinking the company thinks they are special for exchanging their time for unlimited Skittles and gluten-free daily lunch options, Reality’s knock will someday greet the greeter with a very harsh reality outside.Know your worth to the person whose valuation matters most in life – you.Great post today and excellent comments. The death of America was pronounced the day that Bush-II told Americans to go enjoy Disneyland while he fought the, “War On Terror.” The infantalization has become all pervasive as the carcass is ravaged beyond all recognition.

            If you had a Japanese salaryman’s wife who’d popped out the statutory 2 kids and mutated into sack dress maza-mode, you’d probably be happier (relatively speaking, you understand) going out on a Friday night doing mandatory socialising with the boss and co-workers.

        You see the same thing in the private sector.  Like all the publicly traded companies who borrowed money to buy back their own stock based on the low interest rates when they did it. It seemed to me, granted an ignoramus on the topic supply and demand would bite them in the butt. They drove the stock up while buying it and would drive the price down when the inevitable happens and they sell it.  The difference would be higher interest debt.Or how the banks bought record low yielding long term  bonds to back their demand deposits. A demand depositor can demand their money at any time for any reason.A banker with 30 years experience has never worked in anything other than a falling interest rate environment and a low interest rate environment.You would think with 30 years of low and or falling interest rates, our productive capacity would be at an all time high. There’s never been a better time to invest in plant and equipment. Yet, even our most basic infrastructure is decaying and in places, third world infrastructure.

            “Like all the publicly traded companies who borrowed money to buy back their own stock based on the low interest rates when they did it.”That’s LBO security. Or at least used to be. Now that the giants like Blackrock seem not to care how much it costs their investors to destroy companies they don’t like, it probably doesn’t work as well as it once did. Changing the fiduciary responsibility of corporations and hedge funds is taking us into new territory.“There’s never been a better time to invest in plant and equipment.”So long as you don’t put it in the States. As the dollar wanes in dominance, the government is going to demand a larger share of everything they can get their hands on.

            This is why I often say that in order to cure the accumulated mass of economic ills, the policy which would do the least amount of damage to the common man would be a high rate of inflation and aneven higherrate of interest. Monetize the debt while forcing capital be ultra-productive.There are winners and losers to every shift in monetary policy. With this scheme, workers and savers would win big and the stock market would get eviscerated. The only publicly traded companies to survive would be the very leanest and meanest ones who could afford to raise capital in the equity markets by offering extremely high rates of return. In essence, it would amount to clawing back the wealth that was transferred from the working class t Wall Street.

        Good point that America is ruled by hired men and, increasingly, hired women, with no true investment in their actions, and no consequences for their failures.  Queen Victoria New Land an excellent and horrifying example.
However, that’s not the ‘root of the current crisis’.  That would be rebellion against God, with the principal manifestation of that revolt the inversion of the male-female order and relationship.  From this the other modern ills stem, particularly in America, inheritor of Lady Libertas, leader of all revolutions against God.
You got to fix the male-female thing first.  That is what’s dragging the place down.

                She like to be called Toria.  When I said ‘Queen Victoria’ it wasn’t poetic speech.Mama’s name was Goulston.  Family dropped the ‘h’ for cosmetic reasons. :O) NYC product, who could know?  Another rich, snotty, fat, apostate Jewish hag — empowered to the gills — leading the Monstrous Regiment against Father God.  And towing the nations down with her rotting bulk.Toria born into dildo daddy’s money, started at ultra-elite Choate Rosemary Hall, then Brown you get the idea.  Began life in mondo-privilege, slated from getgo for high office in the gynarchy, has never known want, discomfort, or refusal of her orders.All the Woke-Fem Junta knows is doubling down.  Admitting error is not a feminine option, just need to administer a little more force is all.Toria embodies all that is wrong with New Amerika.  She thinks the same about me.

Agreed. That’s why they freaked out so much when the swaggering, arrogant, macho, braggart Trump pimp-slapped Hillary in 2016.
But the Fempire struck back and arrested Trump on over 70 felony charges and got a $5 million award for some fake “rape” allegation.
The problem does not lend itself to any easy solutions.

                Trump enraged the empowered feminine in America and threatened the covert matriarchy.Big, male, white, conservative, feisty and unapologetic.  The very embodiment of what American women both fear and despise.Worst of all, as the Pink Wave rose to crest everywhere in America, the big male white conservative hater stole the Presidency away from the global Champion of Bitchdom, Kankles Klinton.Outrageous, inexcusable, and the sisterhood does not forgive, hounding him every moment of his tenure and undercutting every policy move, often via Ivanka.  Kathy Griffin with the head was their rallying totem.Donald wasn’t indicted because of war opposition, but because he offended against the skankocracy.  Now he must be shown his place and be made to pay, like the J6 ‘insurrectionists’.  Trump is an object-lesson: don’t stray from the plantation.

Remember during the campaign, what enraged the sisterhood the most? It was the ‘grab by the puzzy’ line.  Not only was Donald not grabbing the rotting puzzys of DC hags like Clinton and Pelosi, Donnie could pull young, hot chicks left and right who were, as you note, disposable.
THAT is unforgiveable in a gynarchy.  The hate still burns in their hearts this very moment, because of the attraction/non-attraction thing.   The political stuff is secondary.

                    Sorry. Not what I meant. I have nothing against unions per se. Well, except for government unions. If you are drawing a paycheck from the government, then both sides of the “arbitration” have an interest in stealing more from the taxpayers.
But what we have are privileged unions, with government laws and regulations supporting them. To the extent they do get supported, I mean. It’s always to the benefit of the exceptional to seek to avoid being unionized with slackers.

                        Are there any unions supporting their white, blue-collar employees?  Any that are advocating for no more DIE, no more worship of the alphabet people, no more lectures and trainings designed to push an anti-white agenda?  I haven’t heard of any.

            Ironically, only a different kind of regulatory state could have protected those exported jobs.
On second thought, if the business owners cared about their people, then a regulatroy state wouldn’t be necessary, but we are a long way from that.

                Management sets the tone—why kill yourself trying to implement the owner’s vision when the owner will not share the rewards with you? Why suggest a more affordable or efficient process when there is no benefit to you but only to the owner? I’m not surprised at all that so many real workers are simply marking time, dragging the anchor, working to rule etc, because they don’t feel valued at all, and forget about the “we’re all a team” bs! As far as most managers go, I wouldn’t walk across the street to spit in their hair.

                “if the business owners cared about their people”The owner of the company I work for is German. He’s high-handed at times, but he takes care of you, because he knows who’s making money for him. Otoh, you’re expected to be a good soldier. I suspect that’s a German characteristic.I also suspect what’s seen as exploitation is an Anglo characteristic. I don’t suppose that’s necessarily bad, but it requires the little guy to stand up for himself.Look at America. We’re supposed to be mistrustful of government, a little uppity, a little rebellious. Which of course means the government is expected to take advantage when we aren’t vigilant.Lulled to sleep by postwar prosperity and the myth of FDR, we have only one half of that equation today, although that’s changing.

        “You also see this in how the people in a business think. The person who has been with a company for a long time will often take the long view. This is exclusive to privately held companies, where the owner is directly involved. Those long-term employees take on the owner’s time horizon. The people who move from job to job are opportunists, making what they can from their current situation and then moving onto the next opportunity in which they make little investment.”It’s the MBA mentality. You can see that most executives these days move from one corporation to another, with no real emotional investment in any, and concerned only to pad their resumes. But it goes deeper than this.A society that is not based on ethnicity is going to be based on short-term and expedient transactions, with no-one willing to invest emotional and material capital in essential infrastructure. That’s arguably the root problem with the USA. It’s not a problem for either China or Japan. In other words the MBA mentality is just an outgrowth and extreme case of something rooted in US history. Recall that in the old days American businessmen used to take care to mix different ethnicities together on the shop floor so that no one ethnicity could be predominant. The ethnic glue would strengthen the hand of labor. When everyone is a stranger to everyone else, there’s no real solidarity. As Wilmot Robertson argued in “The Dispossessed Majority”, a nation has never been allowed to form and coalesce in the USA. Americans are supposed to be a “nation of immigrants”, and thus with no real bonds among themselves. A lot of the dysfunction we see in the US is a consequence and corollary of this.

            This is true. America can only be understood by realizing that it started out as a pirate outpost of the British empire and has been a lawless province ran by criminal gangs ever since. There never has been a real country here. I know some commenters will disagree with that, but it’s a big part of the reason why they feel like they have no representation. What they thought of as “their country” was more of an incipient country-idea than an actually existing reality.Many American children, just like many other children in the world, are born with a normal desire to know and love their own homeland, their own people, their own little corner of the world. But Americanculturedemolishes this and either temps the corruptible specimens into serving the POZ or crushes out what refuses be assimilated. The most helpless, hopeless person in America today is man of small means who simply wanted his mother to not be whore and his children to not be playthings and fodder. When you realize that all the might of the empire is directed towards destroying those who are basically good at heart, you understand how satanic the whole thing is.This is why we must give thanks for the example of the Russian economic miracle. The world sanctioned Russia and Russia, instead of collapsing, got stronger, because they built an economy that was based on resources and production rather than on monetary games and redistribution. We now have proof that the POZ is a money waster, that it can be overcome, and that normal people are better off without it.If only the regime would sanction us too! But we do not have to wait for that to get the regime out of our lives. We can take small steps to start removing ourselves from the debt-based system and into the real productive world. Russia is the example that provides direction, edification, and hope, and this is why they hate it so much.

The regime need not take the lead, it is already underway courtesy of BRICS.  Once we can’t print money to pay for crap we don’t need, austerity will naturally follow.  We’ll need to produce goods and services others need and will pay for.

                The world sanctioned Russia
The ZOG sanctioned Russia.  Some big players ignored the sanctions (China), others found ways around it, some mindlessly obeyed.  But it is true that Russia had something the rest wanted.  The ZOG doesn’t really have much to offer in way of real goods, thus must resort to force.
But without China giving the middle kingdom finger to the ZOG sanctions, might have turned out different.

That’s ultimately true, but the effort’s been made, though never finished.
I imagine part of it has been the restlessness of a young nation, but most of it is probably the tide of history. It’s an age of globalization and commerce, hostile to nations.

But with the defeat of the Ukrainian puppet state, the party is about to end. Hardship will arrive like a sledgehammer and a lot of deadweight will fall be the wayside. The urban parasites will turn on each other when food gets scarce and then migrate into the countryside in search of new victims. And this is where we must learn from how Russia is conducting itself in Ukraine currently. When the zombies show on the horizon, you must be well prepared, efficient, and surprising. You must give them a clear and unambiguous reason to go in another direction.Do this, and you will have earned the right to survive.

        Woke up to read the local rag praising the mayor for caving and agreeing to set up “designated camping areas” in the city.  Suggestions are for them to go in the most beautiful public parks, because water/toilets/they deserve nice places to stay too, because apparently fentanyl is better when you’re ruining public spaces you don’t pay for.Every city above 1 million residents attracts a “professional managerial class.”  Their primary goal is to trade-up to the next position.  City leadership, state senator, national Congressman/Senator, then the bully-of-them-all, POTUS.  Go as far as you can, then cash in.Rule 1: Never, ever do anything controversial; always play “compassionate to the masses”, make decisions/policies that will destroy your city in 5-10 years when you’re long gone, but look good now.Sigh.  Our managerial class doesn’t hate us, but sees us as a stepping stone to the next level.

            Perhaps “managerial class” should be replaced with “sociopathic/psychopathic personality type”.  The aspect of using people to obtain personal goals is a hallmark of these types of personalities.  In this case these folk are attracted to government and their entire electorate is used to further personal gain.  And no, these folk do not necessarily stand for election, but they surround those who do.

        The beneficiaries of short term thinking indeed.   Notice that the managerial elite are only just now waking up to the fact that their war making machine is broken.    They exported nearly all of the infrastructure necessary to wage war with China or Russia.I am sure the neocons never considered such a possibility, their pointy little heads being so stupid and evil.   So now they threaten with nukes.    Lavrov responded to that by basically saying if the nukes start flying the U.S. should not think they will be spared the consequences.   The missiles can fly to America as well.I would suggest that Lavrov or Putin need to make another statement to Israel as well.  That is if the nukes start flying not to worry.  We have plenty for America and Israel.

        This NY Post article is encouraging for the simple fact that it’s yet another few inches gained as the tide comes in.Watching the Tuesday circus in Miami and listening to media poohbah pronouncements about the gravity of the moment, I recalled a conversation with a friend about the indictment of Donald Trump.He repeated a phrase he had heard recently: “We’re not voting our way out of this.”“This,” of course, is a reference to the great divide tearing America apart, and Exhibit A is a Democratic president’s willingness to use the Department of Justice as a weapon against his leading Republican rival.Two phrases, “we’re not voting our way out of this” and “the great divide” that are very familiar to people here.  The former can’t be underestimated; it’s the belief that has to be accepted before anything will change.  Unless and until it begins to spread among normies, there can be no hope.  So to see it printed in a rag like The Post has to be seen as a good thing.  It needs to fan out and be repeated over and over until it’s accepted as an inviolate truth.https://nypost.com/2023/06/13/millions-losing-faith-in-our-system-over-trump-biden-divide/

        I think that it’s a bit more nuanced. The group that (for the most part) rules us today did, indeed, take the long the view. They don’t call it the “long” march through institutions for nothing.Generation after generation worked to increase their influence over society and their ability to control politicians through money, media, blackmail, etc. And they were incredibly successful – and a lesson to the DR.But unlike the business owner, their goal wasn’t to build something that would last and would benefit the world. Their goal was to protect their people, which they believed could only be achieved by marginalizing the people who built the country and to profit from what they built.However, they never really had much of a plan for what to do after achieving that goal and that’s where they find themselves today, which is why they have become short-term thinkers. They have no plan for where they go from here other than to stay in power and to continue damaging heritage Americans, so they jump from one current issue to the next.

            That wasn’t “long term” though, if they were thinking long term they wouldn’t have imported a bunch of Indians to supplant themselves.  The fact that they all sang from the same hymnal was their strength, even though the hymnal just had the banana phone song in it.

                        Exactly. The usual suspects don’t usually fare that well when they go up against other similar groups.
The usual suspects’ success over the past 500 years is mostly a combination of 1) having the field to themselves in Europe and America and 2) the success of whites, which the small hats feed off.

            The group that marched a long ways to gain power had a long view, but not a long enough view.  They’re known for their high IQ, but weren’t smart enough to realize how good they had it in America, surrounded by high-trust, low outgroup-preference White people.
They pushed too far, opening the country to the clannish, low-trust, more violent Third World, who this group will now live amongst and compete with.
While it seems like long-term thinking, really it’s short-term thinking.

                It’s a little of both.
Like so many before them, they brought in mercenaries to defeat their hated enemy only to find that the mercenaries are beginning to realize that they can take over themselves.
That’s the next chapter in the country’s history.

        “They gnaw away at the assets of the owner but resent that the owner exists.”
Ultimately, the Left/ Bolsheviks/ Vikings/ Normans/ Turks/ Mongols/ Huns/ Vandals get their wish.  The enemy is conquered and Alaric/ Bonaparte/ Stalin/ Truman sits upon the imperial throne.
The only question remains is if the new ruler eats until the host is nothing but bones and ash or if they get off their bum and, heaven forefend, treat their new realm like an owner.

        There’s a tragic irony in that the nations where individuals have the best long term planning abilities also have the lowest fertility rates. A more impulsive national character, however, results in at least a sustainable population, and often growth and expansion into conquest.The owner/operator class was the nobility, those born into power rather than hungry for it. This was overthrown by the bourgeois who could always imagine being ruled by aspiring talent, never cheaters.Shockingly few ever question the motivations of those interested in certain jobs. They never notice the Department of Defense is full of warmongers, and the DoJ’s Civil Rights Division is full of racists, or the Federal Reserve is full of gamblers, or that CPS is run by pedophiles. The idea that these jobs should go to random people (a king is just a random guy born to be king, by accident of birth) never occurs to the modern mind.The modern mind might just come to an end when someone who wants to see the world burn gets a job managing the nuclear weapons, and that will be that. No one will see it coming except the monarchists.

That is now. Yesterday Z linked a piece from some AEI psychopath who wanted to give the Ukies nukes. He is not an outlier and just said the quiet part aloud. The only reason the hideous madness in Eastern Europe has not gone nuclear is due to Russian restraint. Anyone who lived through the Cold War notes the bitter irony in that.

There is no “Bitter Irony” in that. The USSR didn’t fly halfway around the world to start wars in Korea and Vietnam, and incidentally murder 3mm Lao and Cambodians just because.From Wilson onward the only check on Washington’s militarism has been economic disaster.Happened in the ’30’s and ’70’s and is about to happen again.

                Well, that restraint on the part of Russians worked to our advantage during the Cuban Missle Crisis as well when a Russian submarine,  under depth charge assault, refrained from torpedoing their US Navy attackers for fear of setting off WWIII.

            “We” did sell a lot of real estate to Japan (since resold to China and miscellanous Arabs), and management did try to further sell out the workers by importing goofy foreign ideas. Old guys will remember the movie Gung Ho, a comedy about a factory taken over by Japanese managers. In world release it was called Working Class Man because the title only made sense to Americans. The Japanese management fad quickly passed because it turns out that the only part of their business culture that’s compatible with American management *attitudes* is the part where employees work forever for nothing. “Work like superior miniaturized Japanese drone! No vacation but death!” isn’t very motivating.

                Funny that “gung ho” is taken from the Chinese language. (Means “work with”.) Hollywood always confused East Asians.
Speaking to the differences between Japanese and Chinese work cultures, the Japs (as far as I’ve gathered) are much more “drone-like”. Japs are like the British of East Asia, with their tea and their quiet desperation. The Chinese are the Continentals…diverse, quarrelsome, and prone to mass psychosis.

                The Japanese drone worker is a phenomenon worth noting, but also worth noting is that Japan did not rise from the ashes of WWII simply by working harder or longer than any White man.  Look up and read the history of W. Edwards Deming.  In 1950 he was invited to Japan to talk about his ideas (rejected in the US) concerning quality control in production of goods.What got Japan where is was in the 1980’s was their decision in the 1950’s to build back better and produce the best products obtainable in whatever field Japan competitively entered.  It worked.I still remember when I was a youngster, the slur “Made in Japan” used for most anything cheaply made and easily breakable.  Twenty years later, the best of the best goods were made in Japan—TV’s, car’s, instruments, cameras, etc.  all because of an American whose ideas were rejected in his home country.

The Japanese *are* very different from their other east asian cousins, but they most certainly did benefit from and rebuild their post-war economy due to the widespread availability of cheap labor producing goods for export back to the west. You might be too young to remember the time when all the cheap, easily broken and highly disposable trinkets all said “made in Japan”, just like they now all say “made in China” (or Vietnam, etc.)

        In the corporate world, unlike the government, the short-sighted managerial mindset is reinforced with periodic layoffs.About 5 years ago I was laid off from a company I had worked at for 12 years with 4 promotions.Looking around during the process saw several others like me – people who had soldiered for that place through good times and bad to build it up.  All cashiered to save a few bucks and make room for our diverse replacements.  Made us all feel silly for working that hard and not constantly looking for the better external opportunity.

            Correct.  It is why I have zero loyalty for my company.  I participate in nothing.  I do not attend all hands meetings, I do not participate in social activities or any DIE related things.  I couldn’t give two shits about my company.  I care only that my skills can continue to develop through the work I do and that my check clears every two weeks.  When each check clears, it buys them another two weeks of my commitment to them.  At the end of that two weeks it completely expires until the next check.  Once I’m gone the company could burn for all I care.It’s funny, because I feel the same way about AINO.  This so called “country” can fuck right off.  It hates me so I hate it.

                You realize those two week checks are from the previous weeks you already gave?  Once the check clears, it’s not that you now owe them nothing, but they just now stopped owing you.

            For better or worse (seems like it’s some of both) the younger generations are the ones who have finally seen through the bs en masse. They have zero loyalty to their corporate masters, nor should they.

                I don’t believe our corporate masters are worried.  They have an “App”, Mexican or subcon for those roles.
Over the last 10 years, GloboBank has eliminated or offshored every single entry level job in my department and laid off the most productive Boomers.  At least the new manager is a lesbian, so that’s nice.

        This is the old IBG YBG problem: No one in business cares about consequences five years down the road – the manager tells the subordinate that within that time frame, everyone will have moved on. “I’ll be gone, you’ll be gone.”

        It is no small irony that the largest problem is a small subset of self-hating white people. They are the managerial state and jealously defend their right to be so. That is going away now as the demographic replacement they engineered starts to consume them along with everyone else. Gavin Newsome can degrade and debase himself all he wants but it is highly unlikely any puppet in the Oval Office, especially one from Team D, will be white. That might happen one more time but seems a stretch.And those who will replace the white managerial class will be even worse and usher in the fall of the United States. It will die from dysfunction, not revolution.A Spanish or Han-speaking Jackson, Mississippi, is the future and that assumes the psychopaths don’t ignite a nuclear holocaust.

            Some of them are self-hating whites.  And some of them look white but belong to a different ethnicity that truly loathes whites; these people have modeled anti-whiteness for actual white people and taught the later to hate themselves.
