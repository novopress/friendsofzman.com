        Cohesion versus chaos. All high functioning societies are cohesive because they embody endemic trust and you can work all day instead worrying about getting stabbed in the back. A society disintegrates when you have to constantly look over your shoulder instead of focusing on productive pursuits. This is a natural law like gravity. It doesn’t care if you disagree.

                    My general impression after some discussions is that most all competent people notice, but fear to speak out. In such organizations where diversity is considered a “strength”, those diverse elements—there by dint of diversity rather than competence—are isolated into positions/functions where they do the least harm.
This seems to have worked after a fashion, but is a short term “solution”—only so many of such folk can be accommodated until the drag on the organization becomes life threatening.  Not only life  threatening to the organization, but also life threatening to the people dependent upon it.

                Yeah, I love that.  On vacation passing though Baltimore to the wife, “Boy honey, this place is really, REALLY strong!.  Lock your door to keep the strength out.”

                Diversity is our strength and water won’t wet you. Anybody with two eyes connected to a brain recognizes the lie.  So why does it persist? Because of its political utility. Leftism. Globalism. Profits. Grrrr…I know I’m preaching to the choir, so excuse my intrusion and please read on for to find more edifying commentary than my own.

                    Why does it persist? Bullies.,Case in point: A man got on our “neighborhood” website to express concern and make everyone aware that CAIR had a representative at the last school board meeting.He was immediately met with 50 posts calling him a racist and asking him if he was trying to spread fear of the Islamic kids. This was all done by white women who live in this immediate area.He’ll never do that again. He won’t change his views but now he knows never to vocalize them again.And in 20 years or less, the elementary school will be ordering prayer rugs.

                I think that jig was up long ago, Jim. Even a Yesterday Man like myself was suspecting the existence of the Matrix back in the 90’s. Ask any boomer that went through a divorce or family court… or got replaced by an affirmative action vibrant at work, or was in the wrong place at the wrong time when a spontaneous group of youths decided to have a round of the Knock Out Game.I believe our esteemed host’s analogy comparing our society to cellular biology isn’t bad, but I think it might be better served to scale it up to the evolutionary level: Organisms that don’t fight for their survival die.Pozz and political correctness are not survival traits.

                    Yes the will to fight is the will to survive.Infections can alter the ability to even generate the will or even to alter the will from self-preservation to that of self-sacrefice. We are infected.The pozz parasite has altered our collective immune system. Not only has it rendered it unable to detect other invaders, it has actually inclined to invite more. Even as we step over the rotting flesh of our own people.When the parasite toxoplasma enters a mouse it neutralizes the mouse’s innate ability to detect cats and fear them as predators.The result is the mice wander around with their defenses shut down. They are dumbed down to the point where a cat confronting them generates no fear response. They get eaten.So then the parasite can reproduce in the cat. The Cats get fat and propagate. Parasites have new hosts and propagates.Mice wander around with the flu – and then without fear until they are eventually eaten.The interesting part is that even after a mouse’s immune system has cleared of the parasite, the lack of fear persists.The alterations of the parasite continue to effect the mouse’s behavior.So there is not only great danger in the infection of the pozz while it festers, there are likely people who will never be normal again even IF we are able to clear it from our culture; they will always be a threat to the tribe. This is how I see the leftist mind: infected, likely beyond repair.

                        Amen Brother…Isn’t it ironic that the thing that fights infection and disease is the “white blood cells” but like a doctor will tell you if there isn’t a lot of them doing it in unison then the disease or infection will overcome the host… Which brings us back around to Community once again where white people can work in unison to keep infection and disease contained or killed off…

                        To complete the analogy, it has been said—and there is evidence for this—that we all develop cancerous cells on a regular basis, but that the cancerous cells are detected by the immune system quickly and eliminated.  However, as we age, the immune system weakens and the spontaneous cancerous cells are not eliminated and we are stricken.
So, as societies go, what is now our physiological age and is our societal immune system now so weakened that these societal cancers spring up with greater and greater frequency.  Is this our natural end?

                            Yup. You could say job #1 of the immune system is preventing tumors, ie, rooting out sedition.
Another way cancer beats the rap is by false flag, let’s say.
Cells have signal proteins on the cell membrane that declare themselves. There are immune cells that go around reading these proteins.  If something doesn’t belong they call in reinforcements to destroy it. Sly cancers disguise themselves. Others grow so aggressively the immune system can’t keep up.  Or like you said the organism is too weak to fight.  *If I remember my biochem.*

                            Compsci, to flog the point even further, individual cells also have the built-in self-destruct button should they become weak, infected, or otherwise susceptible to cancerous growth.This autophagy is built-in insurance against cells getting all uppity in their progress.The stressors of hardship actually encourage this function, make the cells more efficient, make the body more robust.The sick or weak animal is killed by the stronger in the pack. Thats the immune system.But in many cases the weak, sick, or injured will also crawl off into the woods In the middle of the night to die alone. That is autophagy; the cells individual program to sacrifice itself for the greater good.With a fat, sedentary population with very low survival stressors, our cells – and our people, are weaker, more susceptible to infection and cancer.All the low-calorie, HIIT, ketogenic, and fasting regimens popular of late seek to reproduce the scarcity-stressor effects that keep individual cells efficient and the body as a whole stronger.People on the individual level will need to embrace their own fitness of mind, body, and soul or the whole will continue to falter.In a time of gluttony, distraction, and abundance we will have to encourage and support a healthy community as much as anything else.

                        As people get older – their attitudes harden.What that means is that – as you said – many people are “gone” and beyond repair.For many others – their natural defense and learning mechanisms likely still work – but, if those mechanisms are fed false feedback – they can never “learn”.Remember that old saying ” some people learn by other’s mistakes, some people learn from their own mistakes – and some people never learn …” ? .Well the never learn contingent is the beyond repair portion of the population you’re referring to.  The “learn from other’s mistakes”  are the people you don’t really need to worry much about – as the globohomo/socialist experiment falls apart they will look and watch and learn from the decay.The real question to get answered is:  How to best apply a beating – so that the attitudes improve on the “learn from their own mistakes” portion of the population.Right now – the globohomo left is trying to gain a monopoly on beatings,  so that punishment for not following their edicts can be applied – and so that punishment over-rides the “natural” punishment that the world would normally apply – for following their edicts.If the globohomo is ever going to be defeated – then punishment must be started getting applied to those who follow their mandates.

                    I’ve been thinking that there is a deep connection between the concept of life itself and the concept of a boundary or border and that this can actually be applied at the level of human societies.To digress a bit, it’s been proven that throwing together a few simple compounds that were present on the early Earth and zapping them with electricity you can generate a surprising number of “biological” molecules including amino acids, sugars, and even short strands of RNA. The problem with going from a pre-biotic soup to a cell is thought to be one of concentration. You must force the various bio-molecules together in a very high concentration. To do that you need a permeable boundary (a membrane) that selectively allows food, waste, and energy to pass in and out while keeping the cell contents inside. The membrane is the essence of life. Tear open a cell membrane, allow the contents to spill out and foreign matter in and the cell dies.Organisms that don’t fight for their survival certainly do die but so do those that can’t maintain a distinction between self and other. Even in human psychological development there is the need for the child to develop this distinction between self and world. If the study of anthropology, psychology, sociology, and history weren’t so hopelessly pozzed it might be possible to incorporate these ideas from biology into them and perhaps even build mathematical and computer models of societal and individual growth (and death).Seen in this light the actions of our ruling class can be viewed as an attempt to merge a group of cells together into an organism by simply tearing all the internal membranes open. It doesn’t work that way.

                        There is a reason you have a skin, a rapidly regenerating protective epidermal layer. There is a reason that DNA is enclosed within a nucleus (a WALL) inside every cell instead of free-floating in the soup like the other organelles. Complexity must be protected from unplanned undesirable interactions or it will be destroyed. The complexity of life is enclosed within a nested sequence of walls that scale with dimension. Putting it another way: nature, or the mathematical understructure of reality, imposes STANDARDS in order for complexity to evolve.The very essence of leftism is to destroy standards. They are at the core of their beings self-hating anti-life.

                        Kind of OT, but there’s the second law of thermodynamics, which describes the natural tendency of ordered systems to break down. So what orders them?  Life. Life isn’t just something that exists in a cold universe. It’s the opposite, ordering principle that works against entropy. Never read that in a textbook, it just occurred to me one day, take it fwiw. Seemed more reasonable to think of life as a principle of reality than something that dies, because life just keeps going on.I never understood why science thinks everything is dead stuff when the reality of life is all around.Life orders and organizes.  It’s the thing that divides.  Death is the gray goo.Edit: thinking about it, this is a flashback to my scientific materialist college days. I think this thought is what brought me back to faith, because I started asking myself questions about what life must actually be.

            Most societies even homogeneous ones are not high functioning past the tribe/clan level .Some Asian societies can be forced to order and a some European societies Christendom and  onward and Japan are naturally high order.This is not a natural condition though as Robert Howard sagaciously notedBarbarianism is the natural state of mankind. Civilization is unnatural. It is the whim of circumstance. And barbarianism must ultimately triumph”And note for almost all its history save the last thousand years or so, most of Europe was barbaric.  Empires like Rome  of course can force men to order but in time they die.As for the current situation well.The current Puritan obsession with work and stuff and achievement  needs to go. Men work countless hours a week to fuel the money mania of Oligarchs and to feed complexity that is poisoning usWe zip here and there and there and here making every place exactly the same and wrecking our ecology, using up irreplaceable “easy get” energy and wasting resources on a countless scale.If this actually made people happier, healthier and maybe wiser, it could be worth it. All it does is make Poz.Making the inevitable collapse pleasant ought to be our job which means homogeneous societies and an emphasis on family, stability and the like not more BS

        You can track the precipitous decline of the States directly against integration of the foreign body with the entirety of its host. Whereas it was growing, but still isolated all that changed in the 60s and we’ve been slowly dying of cancer ever since, though the speed of the disease is rapidly increasing now.Is there any argument that the 50s-60s were the height of the US civilization? Massive prosperity, massive technological innovation, fairly harmonious culture (before ’65), etc. Once ‘civil rights’ and the floodgate of foreigners were opened whites could no longer focus on technological advancement exclusively. You had to also worry about safety now and then later not offending anyone. The amount of lost time, productivity, knowledge advancement, civilizational boosting, and technology between 1965 and 2020 is incalculable.We did our moon shot in ’69 and now we have to hitch a ride to space on Russian rockets. I wonder why? Russians are a homogeneous white nation. NASA is a hodge podge of diversity hires, pajeets, etc. That well oiled high functioning culturally similar machine that it was in the 50s and 60s is long gone. Since we are not allowed by TPTB to excise the rapidly metastasizing cancer the only potential solution is separation. I think anyone with eyes and a functional brain can see that.Lastly, a quick aside, the ‘food truck and kebab stands’ crowd needs a hard slap in the face. If the BEST reason you can think of for importing 3rd world mud people is that they have better food you are likely a limp-wristed lefty sh1tlib. What a sad reason to destroy your heritage and national integrity. Like nobody can make a f-cking taco or put a bunch of meat and veggies on a skewer right? (See: Molly Tibbets father who used this EXACT ‘defense’ of why we need more immigrants. He traded his daughter’s life for a taco truck.)

            Is there any argument that the 50s-60s were the height of the US civilization?Depends on what you mean by civilization. The problem with the Mad Men-era was that it ushered in the culture of consumption, mass television brainwashing, women fleeing the kitchens to divorce their husbands and so forth.Now, I wouldn’t venture a bid as to the greatest decade in US history, civilization-wise, but I figure we should look before 1914. Just a marker: The Last of the Mohicans was the top bestseller in the US for more than a decade when it was published. You might argue its literary qualities, but it is not an easy read; your average 19th C. dirt farmer had little to do in the evening but read – I bet Americans were more literate then than they are today, if you include the diversitarians.

                The peak decade can be argued depending on the preferences of what makes “peak”.  To me, more importantly, what behaviors, policies, and institutions build up and strengthen the culture, rather than tearing it down?
We have seen cultural teardowns in the U.S. beginning in the 1850’s, the 1910’s, and the 1960’s.  It is not so much the peaks as the direction of the processes, IMHO.

                Years ago, when my great aunt died, helped my grandfather go through our old farmhouse figuring out what to do with the contents.  One thing that struck me were the number of books, most owned by my g and gg grandfathers.  History books, gazetteers, law books, literature.  Kept many of them.  These were farmers that were educated in a one room school house that still stood about a mile and a half up the road.  Yet even with bare middle school educations, they took great pains to read and learn, even if self taught.  Kept as many of them as I could haul back home.

                    That was typical. Before television, every farmhouse had a well-used and treasured library.
Have you looked at grade school primers from, say, about 1920 or before? They’re beyond the level of today’s average high school students. That 19th century farmer with his 4th grade education was better educated than many of today’s college graduates, and had a mind more interested in exploring whatever knowledge it could find.

                    My Carnegie-built library “modernized” several years ago and so sold off large quantities of books.  I purchased dozens of history books.  What you read in a history book from the first half of the 20th century is completely different than what’s printed today.  I was also able to score some adolescent-level history books.  They blow away anything that kids get today in their “social studies” (how I despise that term) classes.

            Apex, good point.  I treat such responses—immigrants open great restaurants—as a “tell” of sorts.  I immediately know I am not talking to a serious person (actually a stupid, ideological person) so I don’t waste my time.  There are many such “tells”, but that’s another thread for another time.

                    There seems to be a difference between elite Leftism and what I might call “Folk Leftism”. The young white people who accumulate in hipster enclaves in the cities are practicing the latter. As with most folk religions, there’s a lot of “magic” in it. So the usual response is “well of course I can follow the recipe but only a REAL insert-dirt-worlder-here can make insert-favorite-food-here…”. It’s a variant of what Z has called the Magic Negro meme.

            Good call, Apex.  You’ve skewered the lamest and most cucked of the lot.  Foodie culture is a different kind of sportsball for a different kind of fan.  At least sportsball had some proletarian elements.  Foodie culture is like soccer fandom.
No offense to Euros, this is an intra-American thing.
In our country, soccer fandom is first and foremost a virtue signal that you are not like “low class” fans in more white and blue-collar rooted American sports like football and baseball.  Negrolaters who are NBA fans are a different sect with similar motives.

                    I hear that, Whitney, and have yet to see that in the bible. (I am still on my first pass through it, though, and stand to be corrected if necessary). I wouldn’t be surprised if those are the words of some cucked fake Christian signalling to the left. If I am in error on that – my apologies. I have a homosexual militant SJW daughter and all I can do for her now is pray. After the way she treated me and her mother… let’s just say that God will have mercy on them in His realm. In this one – I want nothing to do with them.

                        There are a few places where it is present – the various times Israel rejects God, gets squashed, returns to God and gets raised up again.  In the NT, parables such as the prodigal son. lost sheep, lost coin give a similar message.  However, beware the preacher who pushes forgiveness without true repentance and amendment of ways – therein lies the “cuck.”

                Homosexuals are essentially parasites.They cannot reproduce naturally – without lying about who they “are”.I’ve been hearing for years – from homosexuals – about how homosexuality is “normal”.  Well I guess they have a different definition of normal – than I do.Confronted with the constant blatherings of the homosexuals and their word games – I was forced decades ago to consider exactly what the word normal must mean – in relation to human beings, and came to the conclusion that “normal” especially in relation to homosexual behavior must mean “ability to reproduce absent extraordinary measures” – or – by taking into account the homosexuals claim that their BEHAVIOR was normal – whether they could reproduce if they exclusively engaged in that behavior.In all of medical science I could not find one instance of a human egg spontaneously growing inside a man’s butt, nor any instance when a human embryo was brought to full term in the lower intestines and then birthed thru the human anus ( butt baby ).I was therefore forced to come to the conclusion that homosexual behavior is not “normal”.A couple of decades later – I actually came into contact with some male homosexuals – and found out they had kids.  The backstory there was that essentially – they lied to women,  got them pregnant with children – and then left shortly thereafter to “find themselves” – as homosexuals.So basically what happened is that these male homosexuals lied to women about who they were – in order to propagate their genes.  Another trait I noticed about these men – is that they lied about all sorts of other things as well.  One of them in particular would say things like ” all men are really gay”.  Which was a lie he told himself and others – probably to mentally justify who he was – to himself and others.I know religious types constantly revert back to the morality of homosexuality.  My problem with that is that in an age when traditional morality is being subverted by left (and right) – having that as the only fall back position seems like an exercise in predestined defeat.There has to be a more in-depth defense against globohomo.  And I don’t think you need just rely on morality to make the argument that homosexuality is not “normal” .

                    Men are very physical and visual about the sex thing.  Most men, no matter how they are socialized around it, find the idea of a gay male sex act as seriously “Ew, you’ve got to be kidding me”.  The culture can bang away all it wants to about rights and tolerance and acceptance and celebration, but one cannot socialize away the “ew” factor.  Which once again is a demonstration of how much our culture attempts to ignore human nature in the ways it goes about things.  The typical male, away from the public posturing to keep his job or to demonstrate his “wokeness”, cannot change the “ew” that he privately holds.

        Historically the American approach to outsiders was a bit more complex than that.  When outsiders showed up in large groups – Italians, Irish, etc., they also ended up in ghettos.  Getting out of the ghetto and being accepted into mainstream society required accepting (or doing a good job of pretending to accept) the values of mainstream society – which often took a generation or two.  Walking around dressed like a European peasant and failing to speak English got you shunned by neighbors and employers.Now that carrot and stick approach to assimilation is gone.  We are supposed to “celebrate” people far more alien than the European peasants – not shame and shun them.  And many of them have no intention or ability to assimilate.  Either they belong to a truly foreign religion or are just too dumb to ever fit in.

        It took the better part of the 20th century for white, European immigrants from Ireland, Poland, Italy, etc to successfully assimilate into American culture and they were at least trying. It caused a great deal of strain in my dad’s family that he didn’t marry a Polish girl.
Our new immigrants, welcomed in by the millions by America-First President Trump, have no interest in assimilating or becoming American. They simply want our stuff without having to deal with the people who created it.

            As we fall to less than 50% of the population, the brown horde will be America and what it means to be American.
American no longer means what it once did. People need to let it go. You aren’t an “American” anymore, at least not in a spiritual sense. It’s not our country anymore. We have to accept that, and move on mentally to create something new.

            Did they ever though?To this day, Minnesota, where Swedish immigrants clustered, is characteristically cucked-out and polite to self-injury.There is no such thing as assimilation. There is integration, whereby the foreign nation mimes the host convincingly enough no longer to stand out as out of place, ensuring a tolerated presence. There is intermixing, or amalgamation, where separateness is not erased either since the resultant nation is different from both preexisting ones, neither of which surviving if the phenomenon is widespread enough. A third option is subjugation, where either nation establishes dominion over the other such that the threat of competition is neutralized through a system of formal or informal hierarchized cohabitation. The fourth and final possibility, called cleansing, involves rolling back the ingress or displacing the host.

            New year’s eve I was in a small town. Tiny, but close enough to wealthy white exurban communities to exist comfortably in the bubble. The types of towns that regularly make the ‘best cities to live’ ‘…raise children’ etc.At this restaurant/bar having dinner, surrounded by blue state boomers; those persistent leftist types that transcend economic station. The retired teachers and private finance types, united in their desire to see Progress; the prius parked next to the Tesla.No young families. No kids at all actually. But for one. The barkeep’s baby. A toddler.The barkeep, who just acquired the restaurant as of Jan 1, white lady, looked to be in her 40’s. Short hair, some purple. Tattoos. Generally large but not obese. I’d say typical American girl but I loathe admitting defeat.Her baby was brought in by her husband and his mother to visit while she worked.They were Africans. Not AA, but legit from the continent. The baby, of course, cute as can be what with the approved diversity genes and curly little fro.The boomerlibs at the bar could not get enough of him. Doting. Passing him around. Doing the usual things.Their own grandkids somewhere else of course, or perhaps in the form of boston terriers, as many were the “‘my grandkids are french bulldogs” bumper-sticker types.The Africans could not have been less enthusiastic about the whole scene, moving from indifferent, to annoyed, to outright expressions of disdain.All of which was lost on the boomer crowd gathered around to pay tribute.These lottery-winners, refugees or peace-corps prizes, or whatever, have struck white gold. Yet they could not hide their negativity toward the place, these people, and having to be there among us.Maybe it was an off night for them. But I have seen this time and again in my time working with ‘refugees’.They say resentment is the number one predictor of a doomed marriage. The dad and the mother-in-law had it pouring out of them.Meanwhile, the wife was beaming with progressive pride, while the boomers, all well-to-do white folks, were somehow immune to picking up on the repeated signals of hostility and disgust.This microcosm of diversity is our strength was my intro to the current year. Watching legacy americans fawn and preen while literally handing the future over to Real Americans who hate them.

        The Sports/Entertainment complex facilitates this self-deception.  Imagine a group of adult males at a bar.  Instead of talking about any number of important topics (like this one) they talk about the latest Star Wars movie or the NFL Playoffs.  Sports/Entertainment is a conversational safe zone, with the weather being an intro.  It’s also a conversational blow-up doll where time is wasted talking about meaningless things while the world burns around us.  As Americans we’re raised from day one to be adult juveniles, going into insulin shock five minutes into a laser tag game, watching plotless CGI laden movies. The outsider being a man who’s bored with being a child, who hasn’t missed the plot.

We live in an infantilised culture.Exactly so. My biggest problem with taking Vox Day seriously as a conservative or whatever he is, is that he promotes poz culture. I appreciate (in principle – I haven’t seen the end product) his re-editing classics for children in comic book format, but the critical word here is “children”.If you’re 25 and still a comic book buff, you’re not a serious person. Also, men wearing latex in a professional capacity should not be your role models.

            Sometimes the genome will change – a mutation – due to internal forces. Genes just make a mistake when they replicate. The genome can also change due to external causes. Cigarette smoke. Radiation.
The menome (did I just invent a word?) can change too. Memes are sneaky little mutants that are generated in academia, are highly contagious, virulent, and spread rapidly. The classroom. Television. The media. Thusly, some deadly little meme such as “Diversity is Our Strength!” begins its attack on the menome.

        We are not a species that does well with scale.  Communities used to be made up of a size where all the fathers could get together to talk about problems the community was facing in a decent sized barn.The mass movement into cities was bad enough, but then someone got the idea that what we really needed was to bring together foreigners from all over the world into one spot with relatively large amounts of anonymity.  This anonymity is one of the reasons crime has always been far worse in cities than in the country side. Not the only reason, but an important reason.  Now they want to take that level of anonymity and dial it up to 11 with foreigners that can all hide out in ethnic ghettos and criminal gangs can organize around ethnicity.  Then they can prey on other ethnic groups.  Then law enforcement can be re-framed by the criminals as ethnic based oppression.  Then there’s the ethnic based grift and fraud.Then they have the nerve to claim that this is not only a strength, but our GREATEST strength.  I just hope that when the SHTF, the right people get got.

                The prepers are the worst.  They really think they can hide behind a gun.  Most of them are really just larpers who view “prepping” as a lifestyle you can order off Amazon and learning the 10 most difficult ways of starting a fire or stocking up on really overpriced processed foods.  They can’t sew or cook or fix a car or a 100 other useful things in the apocalypse.The idea that they need a good solid community all together in one space just never crosses their minds.Of course they are prepping for the most unlikely events.  If you live in Western NY, prepping for blizzards probably isn’t a bad idea along with prepping for floods in the South East or Earthquakes in commiefornia, but most of these guys think or say they are prepping for large scale grid down or collapse of transportation Mad Max stuff.This is probably just another manifestation of clownworld.

                    Tars, preppers are good for Us on the whole, guys who for the most part have the iconoclasm and resolve to step away from Clown World.  Some are simply misdirected.You’re right about those, guys who don’t develop a versatile skill set based more on self-sufficiency than battle-tactics and guys who fail to see that numbers are how you best develop that skill-set as a community, the “do it alone” preppers whose vision of the future is a cabin on Ruby Ridge rather than a home in a small town.Of course those are the types you see depicted in media.  The real-life prepper community is a lot more serious and sober-minded.

                        I agree they are mostly good guys and probably not outright hostile to us.I’m not getting my idea of what a prepper is from the TV. I haven’t watched TV since about 04 or so. I get the impression from YT preppers.I grant you that a lot of the channels think they are a YT star and should make YT videos for a living, and so grifters are more prevalent, but a lot of these channels pushing knives, flashlights, packaged meals and fire-starters have pretty large followings. Someone is watching them.I made the mistake of getting into a back and forth with one telling him there were probably old people who didn’t prep in the event of the apocalypse, who know all kinds of things you don’t know and would be worth their weight in ammo and wouldn’t each much.  Of course, I might as well have been banging my head into a wall. Just knowing how to can would be a big benefit. Knowing how to smoke meat for preservation. Making butter etc.  But they think prepping for these highly unlikely events means buying junk off of Amazon made in China.

                        Lineman—Interesting observation. I am trying to reconnect with old friends who I had lost contact with.
Last week I visited one such friend in the South. He and his immediate family are living in a place where they connect with no one and don’t try.
I see a perfect Ruby Ridge situation where they are taken out easily in a strike that can happen at any time. This guy is smart and prepared but it is just him and his family.
When I left I told him good luck but I will not be contacting him again.

                Lineman, you need to read something on Michael Collins during the Irish fight for independence. I’m reading “The Squad” (and the intelligence operations of Michael Collins) by T. Ryle Dwyer. It’s a darn insightful book on how the IRA organized to fight the British. I find it inspiring, and I say that as someone descended from the Ulster Scots Irish prods. TimNY

            Scalability is something I think about often.
The US republic is scaleable…to a point. Clearly, we’re well beyond anything that our current Constitution is capable of managing. Hence, constant ad hoc “band aids” from courts, from federal bureaucracies, executive orders just to keep the plates spinning in the air.
“Self government” for 330 million people who don’t even share the same language is impossible.

        Freedom of association implies the inherent right to exclude.Somewhere, in all the “can’t we all get along” nonsense, and dozens of federal court decisions, the idea that someone, somewhere, might not get to be a part of a group they want to enter became the worst thing ever.If I could wave a wand and get in the way back machine, I’d make freedom of association the number one law of the land, inviolate, and unchangeable.Even lefty platforms like Twitter acknowledge this: users can block viewers, have private platforms, etc.But put that into place in the real world?  Never.

        “A society of strangers is not a society, but an ad hoc collection of people living outside their natural society. There is a word for such an arrangement. It is called a prison.”This is what makes our current predicament unique, prison on a civilizational scale:We have a ruling force (a minority) that has disassociated itself from its natural base (a majority). If they go too hard at dissent they will attract attention to it and help it spread thanks to resentment and other innate forces they cannot control.  The growing sense of a need to act as a group to protect group interests for whites has grown to a point where attempts to control it are all temporary Hail-Marys.  You can control for a 5 year flood, pretty well for a 10 year flood, for sensitive areas in a 20 year flood…then what…The pressure builds.The legacy population has a growing sense of its diminishing position in the society their ancestors built. But they remain tight-lipped or pretend it’s no big deal to avoid painting a target on themselves. So the pressure builds as the ruling forces, unable to restrain themselves, keep ratcheting things up.  The pressure builds.The outsiders left their natural lethargic cultural settings to live among strangers so they could accumulate stuff unavailable to them or harder to get back home.  Having never lived among strangers in a strange land they are finding out it has a lot of drawbacks, very stressful ones. So their resentment increases their volatility and inability to fit in. They make more and more demands and receive more and more accommodations. This gives them a false sense of power, believing it is them driving the agenda…so they push harder and harder.  The pressure builds.After 3000 years of running more or less the same scam they were were certain they had finally grabbed the brass ring. A ruling hand on nearly every lever and every knee bent not in fear but in holy acquiescence to what was considers acceptable and good.  Then a few of them let the veil drop too too early and their old enemy – being noticed – reared its head. Act…Overreact…Scream the magic words.  The pressure builds.On this side of the pond there are no nationalist parties to absorb the growing resentment so the pressure builds unabated. Maybe at some point the ring masters may decide separation is better than the alternative. Probably not. Interests have become too deeply vested.  The alternative is probably inevitable.

            There are lots of things to notice these days, but a culture that is declining, not growing, devolves into a free-for-all over who can grab the various brass rings of power and wealth, as everyone goes around on the merry-go-round.  It appears to me that this is where our situation lies, these days.

            YY, I think the sheer scale of America makes a “national nationalist” party untenable.  We could make an impact in formal politics on a local level, on a long timeline maybe even state level (to the extent states matter now, having mostly been reduced to administrative subdivisions of the Feds).  That said, the scale of America also makes it difficult to hold together under an enforced mono-culture.Building for Balkanization is the solution.  These analogies are always imperfect, but there’s an archaeo-futurist parallel here to the feudal succession to Imperial Rome.  Common-sensically enough, one thing I’m getting from a lot of “collapse” reading (working on Orlov on flight home) is that a deliberate, informed and planned collective response to collapse is preferable to simply hoping it won’t happen.We don’t know yet how collapse will happen or when, but we know enough to say it will happen.  Why not plan for it?

                I agree. Both the collapse and the response to that collapse will have a regional character.  Which is why you should do as I have and leave California.

        North versus South segregation:I was in the Marine Reserves.  In my first unit in Massachusetts suburbs, there weren’t many blacks and they certainly didn’t segregate themselves.  Then I moved to North Carolina.  My new unit is Greensboro was about 50% black.  The first time I walked into the drill hall, the white Marines were all in a group on one side, the blacks all in a group on the other.  I thought “you have to be shitting me”.

            Actually, it’s common human behavior.  Put a small number of any group into a larger group and they’ll, by necessity, socialize with the larger group.  Get enough numbers in the minority group, and they’ll split off by themselves.  Had a number of S. Koreans at a private school and the S. Koreans kept to themselves.  Talked with the S. Korean teachers and they pointed out there were too many S. Korean students at the school.

            The old line was that whites in the North would treat blacks as equals, but they did not want to love near them. Whites in the South were fine living next to blacks, but would not treat them as equals. This remains true even today. It’s why blacks think Boston is a racist city. They instantly pick up on the physical separation.

                There’s a great quote from Gone With the Wind that shows this attitude very well (I expurgated this to bypass filter…)….“My nurse, my Bridget, has gone back North.  She said she wouldn’t stay another day down here among the ‘naygurs’ as she calls them. And the children are just driving me distracted!  Do tell me how to go about getting another nurse.  I do not know where to apply.”“That shouldn’t be difficult,” said Scarlett and laughed.  “If you can find a darky just in from the country who hasn’t been spoiled by the Freedmen’s Bureau, you’ll have the best kind of servant possible.  Just stand at your gate here and ask every darky woman who passes and I’m sure–”The three women broke into indignant outcries.“Do you think I’d trust my babies to a black n-?” cried the Maine woman.  “I want a good Irish girl.”

        It sounds like the Zman has been reading Hilaire Belloc recently. The introduction of his 1922 work ‘The Jews’ describes the problem and possible options in the same way as this post. Of course, Z’s identification of the broader scope of the challenge of diversity is a useful extension, and also is a good reminder to the subscribers of ‘magic jew theory’ that this is a generalized problem, not just a specific one related to a specific race of people.“That problem is the problem of reducing or accommodating the strain produced by the presence of an alien body within any organism. The alien body sets up strains, or, to change the metaphor, produces a friction, which is evil both to itself and to the organism which it inhabits. The problem is, how to relax those strains for good and to set things permanently at their ease again.”

            Funny, but I was searching my memory banks for where I read similar discussions of the role of outsiders. I thought maybe it was de Maistre, but I could not find anything similar. Then I thought maybe it was Sowell. He wrote about middlemen minorities. Not really the same thing.
I gave up as I had to get going, but Belloc was who I could not recall. Good catch. Thanks.

                “That’s a fault.”Not necessarily. While it’s true that it’s a general problem, in the US it IS mostly – nearly entirely – one ethnoreligious group. What’s local matters most.So if you’re in the SW US and concerned about venomous creatures, then the rattlesnake and the scorpion are your main problems. Sure the blue-ringed octopus is more lethally venomous, and the platypus more absurdly poisonous, but no one could possibly fault you for focusing on Mr Rattler and his buddy Mr Scorpion, seeing that the other noxious creatures are in Australia.Not that I’m calling any group of poor eternally victimized, by definition always blameless, persons snakes or vermin. Duh.

        Some members of various minority groups are afflicted with what I call “resentment of marginality.”  They have a grudge against society because they’re out of the mainstream and that’s why they’re prone to adopt radical ideas and get involved with radical groups.A member of a minority is typically more conscious about being out of the ordinary than a member of the majority.  A man who is 4 feet tall is more conscious of his height than a man who is 6 feet tall.A Black resents seeing White angels on the stained glass windows at church and  American history is largely White history.  A Jew resents that Christmas is a Federal holiday and the inclination of Christians in the past to defend their interests.  I recall reading somewhere about the 1950s British belief  connecting homosexuals with Soviet spying.  The “mewling minorities,” as I call them, blame White Gentiles for their problems and shortcomings and also resent the fact that they are not the mainstream and in charge.

            This fits with my definition of “white privilege” as actually “ white obliviousness”.  We live in a historically white-dominated society filled with white institutions, and accept our heritage environment as a fish accepts living in water, without much thought about what it is or how it works for them.A problem we have today is that people like BLM are intent on eliminating the white person’s obliviousness to how things have been.  To “wake” whites through intimidation, and either threats or actions of violence, does not exactly send the message that where they want whites to go is a place that whites would want to go.  Is BLM doing everyone a favor here, by not sugarcoating where this all goes?

                Right.  Our host with the most was redpilled early, living in Baltimore, where Whites are a minority.
Since WWII, Whites typically fled darkening neighborhoods, pushing deeper and deeper in suburbia.  Sooner or later, you run out of places to flee to.  Being nice to not nice people only emboldens them.  I think that normies don’t want to think about where this all goes?  They don’t want to think about a future where White people are a despised minority in our own country.

            The multi idea with Anglos, Dutch and Germans (not counting blacks–they were slaves) is a whole different ballgame than the multi idea with Somalians, Guatemalans, and Pakistanis.

            Beginning in 1848 the US received a huge wave of immigration from Germany. Millions of new people with no cultural connection to the American Revolution or British customs settled in the North and upper Midwest. In the 1850s a new political party was born, self described as radical this new party had a new conception of what America was. This party won the 1860 presidential election setting off a war in which their side made extensive use of immigrants. Ultimately the new comers won the war, indoctrinated the idea of  a “proposition nation “, reversed the bill of rights on the states and refounded America in their image of a centralised top down managerial state.Essentially, these immigrants became colonizers simply due to the weight of their numbers. It happened again in the early 20th century with the result that the democrat party flipped from being  the conservative party to the progressive liberal party leaving no political room for original American ideas at all. Now our politics is people with shallow roots and weird names debating how many foreigners we should call Americans each year.

                Both my parents grew up in the rural Midwest.  One thing I recall was that there were still towns that were “German”—all the Lutheran churches were there.  Then there were the “Anglo-Scot” towns that featured Presbyterian, Methodist and a smattering of Baptist churches.  There were virtually no Catholics.  My mother ended up learning all the Catholic stuff since her best friend was one of the few in town and had no one to study for her confirmation with.

                    It was like that when I grew up in Central Minnesota long ago. There were Catholic towns  (German, Polish, Czech) and Lutheran ones, Scandinavian. You could guess which type just by looking at the church.

                Yup. Essentially Bismarck won.Here, have some carefully selected highlights from that Oh so reliable source:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck
” Bismarck created the first welfare state in the modern world, ….., he allied himself with the low-tariff, anti-Catholic Liberals and fought the Catholic Church in what was called the Kulturkampf —”

            The immigration racket is hardly new . One of the grievances the Founding Fathers had was that George wanted to keep Germans out as he didn’t want to rule over them#7 “He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.Basically the Founders were greedy for land and greedy for more citizens to both grift off of and to build an economy and when the King said “We have enough I can barely keep up with what I already have, whelp time for civil warI mean when I read the Deceleration of Independence the thing that stuck out is not “muh freedom” but how self serving and circular  it was.

        Gone to the movies lately? 1917 is a good flick on the self destruction of western man. Interesting way to shoot the movie with one long take and no edits. However before the main event wading through what Hollywood has in store for us like black women James Bond 007’s and Nazi hunting multiculturals led by Al Pacino on Amazon Prime is disheartening.I am afraid the parasites have already gone to far in the destructive process for western man.World War 1 might have been the beginning of this phase?Not gonna get out of globo homo easily at this point in history I am afraid but we gotta start somewhere. At least more of us are seeing the danger for our civilization  I think.

            WW1 was definitely the catalyst for so much of this.  We have yet to recover from it.  All of the major turning points for where we are today happened long before most of us were ever born.  By the time I was born everyone was already staring at mood rings in post Vietnam self indulgence.  Where do you go from there?  Nowhere but downhill.

            I’m convinced it’s something to do with the Germans. I don’t know what it is or whose fault but the creation of Germany seems to have destabilized Europe in a way it never recovered from.  The other powers want to keep them down, they react by trying to take over.  Even with Rome, it was Germanic people who were the wrecking ball.  Very interesting.

                Europe has always been unstable, and the Germans get singled out for the era of you-know-who.  That said, and having lived there for a bit, Germany in the ‘70s was a remnant of the old, in which place and identity were very big things.  Your hometown was indicated on your license plate, in the first letter or two, and it mattered.  Who you were and who Germany was in the scheme of things was very important.  That was overlaid with, particularly among the young, an unrooted and more nihilistic attitude.  Hence the arrival of the EU.  The young adults of the ‘70s have grown up and taken over.

                You may be right.  Europe seemed a more stable place when the German duchies were independent.  If the Prussians decided to war with the world, the Hessians and Bavarians would just shrug. Probably doesn’t help that Germany was united under the most militaristic and controlling of the territories.

                    Europe seemed a more stable place when the German duchies were independent.Europe is “stable” as long as Britain manages to maintain the “balance of power”, which is to say, always fight against the largest power on the Continent as to prevent a unified Europe.When Spain was the most powerful country in Europe, Britain fought Spain. When France was riding high, Britain fought the French. So when the Germans became the most powerful country in Europe, well, they made an enemy of Britain. After Germany was defeated, Russia was the biggest dog in the yard.The stability of the Pax Brittanica requires alot of warfare.

        In “corrections theory,” they categorize the goals of a penal system as protection of the community, punishment of the offender, retribution for the victims, deterrence of potential copycats, incapacitation of the offender (preventing recidivism) and rehabilitation.And yes, these overlap somewhat.  Redundancy in the persecution of vice is a virtue in this harshest of “critical” theories.Executing offenders satisfies all goals but “rehabilitation.”  Incarceration allows for rehabilitation at the cost of undermining the other five goals.  Yet we persist in preferring the shackle to the rope.But unlike the Central Park Jive and the murderers of Tessa Major, there is no rehabilitation for Us in Weimerican Justice. Once you No Black, you can’t go back.Judeo-Cromwellian Wokeness offers Our Guys only the rope.But they’re just whistling past (yet another) imaginary graveyard. Cancel Culture is a cargo-cult ritual of virtual execution, our Marvel Comics eternal comeuppance.In the same way that I used to wish away the inconvenient poor and creatively destroyed as a libertarian, Wokies simply wish us out of existence without confronting the hand-dirtying detail that still, we persist.This blind spot is One Weird Trick we’re looking to exploit in jail-breaking for the sticks.  Out of sight, out of mind.   Once we’re Cancelled, we exist only in their Outer Darkness.“Mission accomplished,” they assume, with the same arrogant disregard for the devilish details that forever hung that phrase around W’s jug-headed neck. Iraqis and Afghans by sheer Will to Live beclowned W forever and will soon Get Their Countries Back.Anything they can do, based Whites can do better.  It’s not as if we’re facing drone-strikes &amp; SPECFOR search &amp; destroy missions.Yes, it can get worse, but for the inevitable nay-sayers who see only death squads and FEMA camps for future TRS pay-Chads and J-woke preppers, I ask you for the 100th time “what’s your better plan?”

            No drone strikes…yet.  There is an idea that people can isolate themselves behind the lines of a “forbidden zone”, some far-off place where they can do their thing and everyone buying into the “woke” thing can do theirs.But remember that being “woke” means you don’t just live your own life according to certain principles, but you force everyone else to do so as well.  That’s where the drone strikes on the forbidden zones come in.The response to all of this is for different people to do different things.  Some move to the forbidden zones.  Others live semi-openly in the occupied territory, and build little enclaves there.  Others go deep and dark, as solo operators, doing whatever it is that they do.  Some provide outreach, others provide transit away from danger, or a safe space in which to land.  No one knows how things will play out, but being prepared for many different scripts is the way to go.We need to do it all, and different people will have different roles.

                Agree Dutch, said much the same before.  This isn’t to say there’s only One Trick, but merely that it’s One Trick we can and should use.I do think that we tend to overestimate the long-term willingness of our opposition to do scaled-up violence here at home, especially if it begins to upset their own cushy lifestyles.  The US hasn’t suffered from what we’ve traditionally seen as a “war footing” since the Vietnam draft.Remember that the second-biggest driver for anti-war sentiment in Vietnam beyond the draft was the media coverage including unprecedentedly-graphic footage of casualties.I’ll be semi-contrarian in saying that, contra the usual expectation of “kids raised on violent video games.” the two-plus generations raised on comic-book depictions of violence and Star Wars visions of conflict wouldn’t hold up well in the face of this happening here on a large scale.Sub-rosa drone strikes might fly for awhile but it’s going to be hard to keep the wraps on that stuff in a land where even homeless guys have vidya-ready Obamaphones.

I agree, but note that empires with monocultural ruling class can remain intact with authoritarian rule for a long time. It is when the ruling class itself goes multicultural that doom comes on black wings. Ruling elites then spend energy disputing civilizational mission rather than faction balancing proles.

        Totally OT, but I just thought folks might find this amusing…The other night I dreamed I was walking down the street on Ventura Blvd in Los Angeles (in the Valley).  It’s one of the only parts of LA with a pedestrian street scene — people walk around shopping and so on.  It’s also near the neighborhood where Steve Sailer lives.Anyway, who should walk past but Steve himself.  He was only about 15 feet away, so I called out to him – “Hey Steve, I’m a fan of your stuff!  You got five minutes to chat about issues?”He kind of shifted back and forth, sort of uncomfortable, staring at the pavement, and made up some excuse.  “Yeah, um, I’d really love to chat, um, but I, uh… I gotta take my dog, to the uh… thing.”  Then he bolted down the street.Even in my dreams I get snubbed.

        Great post Z-man. But the thread is even better. Congrats to the posters here.I find that the basic unit of society is the family. The extended family could be called the “tribe” or the “nation” (the real meaning of the word). Mankind was made to live in his own tribe.I don’t think we have any freedom at all if we do not have the freedom of association and the freedom to “tell it like it is”.For the above reasons, and so many reasons given in the great comments above I am afraid only violence lies ahead of us in the USA.

                The other thing that was striking is that virtually the entirety of the hotel staff was what I’ll term “miscellaneous Slav”.  All but the housekeeping staff spoke impeccable English, but were from all over SE Europe.   Far higher proportion than in the past.

                I believe there’s a Freudian connection to this.  Western men (let’s face it, white men) were totally emasculated years ago.  As white women survey the landscape of sad eunuchs around them, they want to import savage men.  They secretly fantasize about being raped in the dark corner of a metro station, being taken by some brutish foreigner, even if he’s an inbred mongoloid.  They’re desperate.  “Okay!  Have your way with me!.”  Instead they mostly go home and stare at their cats scratching the cat condo in the living room.

        “Human society is an organism.” Hmmm. I doubted the analogy…until I read it’s NOT an analogy:ORGANISM, noun1. a form of life composed of mutually interdependent parts that maintain various vital processes.2. a form of life considered as an entity; an animal, plant, fungus etc.3. any organized body or system conceived of as analogous to a living being: the governmental organism.4. any complex thing or system having properties and functions determined not only by the properties and relations of its individual parts, but by the character of the whole that they compose and by the relations of the parts to the whole.

        Always looked at outsiders like parasites. Latching onto their white host, sucking out their lifeblood ( finances ) preventing them from raising their own children. Draining their victims to raise their own parasitic offspring.
Of course globohomo plays a part in our demise. Letting the vermin eat us alive in hopes that they may raise another batch of obedient consumers.

        I know that it’s axiomatic on /ourside/ that people naturally self-segregate, but sometimes I wonder if it’s actually the case. Hear me out. People self-segregated in the past not because they were consciously self-segregating, but because it was very difficult to pick up and move the family. It was dangerous to travel. There wasn’t common currency or Fodor’s or Google translate, and xenophobia was of course rampant. Now it’s rather easy to travel, most governments open their arms to foreigners (or “investment” to placate the xenophobes) and people do it by the truckload (literally) and almost every large city is multicultural to some extent. I know that people of a feather tend to cluster together after they move to a non-native space, but they still quite willingly rip themselves out of their cozy jungles or pastoral steppes to live in what /ourside/ calls vibrancy.I am not arguing in favor immigration or migration, but it seems that a fairly large minority of any given population will choose to live among people not like them, given the chance.

            Economic incentives (both ‘work’ and ‘welfare’) drive a lot of the migration. As for heritage folks that willingly move into diversity, most are childless, unmarried, or gay. It’s a lot easier to live in diversity when your children aren’t subjected to it. There’s a reason that ‘good schools’ is a code word among real estate agents.

                “Good schools”, the shorthand term for self-segregation into preferred cultures via buying into a “good” neighborhood, if one can afford it.  No doubt one reason why schools have been targeted for desegregation for decades, and now, more directly, section 8 and other neighborhood bust-ups.  At some point, “good schools” will be one of those odious terms that good people should not use…

                That’s true. But I was thinking of families primarily. Most of the diversity I see in my home town are families. Third-worlders are attracted to white societies because they function. (They would be attracted to East Asian ones too, if they’d let them in.) So it’s possible that families would rather live where it’s secure &amp; opportunistic over ethnic reasons. Whites think in terms of the cozy &amp; happy homeland because we have cozy &amp; happy homelands, and we may project that onto other peoples. Somali or Burmese peoples don’t give an F about their ethno-states, they just want “good schools”.

                    Yes, immigrant families that want a piece of what we prefer to live in as well, and they pay up handsomely for the privilege (as the rest of us do, if we can).  I do not hold it against them, and I would do (and have done) the same.  But others, seeing themselves on the outside, typically by the economics of it, choose to tear it all down instead.  Remember the pool party in McAllister, TX a few years ago?  Whatever it started as, it turned into a neighborhood cultural teardown exercise.

Untrue. They bring their clan conflicts with them into the new world. And they care about their ethno-states a great deal. This is why Ilhan Omar is the US Representative to the Somalians, not to her little district in Minnesota. She strives to be as “other” as possible, to never let anyone forget she is not a native born American.

                        Ilhan Omar is a manifestation of what happens when immigration overwhelms an area, and the crowd takes over from the occasional individual.  A family moves into an area, and little often (but not always) changes.  Ten families move in, and the neighborhood takes on the characteristics of the people that moved there, every single time.  So the question becomes, what is the right number of “different” people to tolerate moving into an existing neighborhood?  The number seems to be shrinking all the time, I know it does in my own head.

                    Marko, a lot of that is a function of cultural compatibility and critical-mass numbers.  A handful of immigrants from a widely-divergent culture like Somalia keep their head down and enjoy the “good schools.”  This is what I saw with Blacks in Denmark.If and when that group gets large enough, they start flexing to change the community at large to accommodate more of what they want and push out that they don’t.  This is what I saw with Turks and other more established Browns in Denmark.  See also Islamic facilities and no-dogs, no-alcohol cabs at Minn-St. Paul airport.It’s not a good-bad thing in the moral sense, it’s just how people are.  It’s why we don’t “hate” immigrants, we simply want what’s best for our people.  Negative vs. positive identity.

                        I see that. I remember reading somewhere that if the immigrant total reaches between 20 and 30 percent, you start getting flexed on. Major League Baseball is a good example. It’s probably somewhere north of 30 percent now, and basically it’s now a mix of Dominican slumball and country hardball, with the Latin peacocking getting more egregious.
