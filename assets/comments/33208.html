        It is a cluster, no doubt, and as images emerge of Christians being raped and murdered by clients of the United States government, Americans will grow even more hostile to its brutal and retarded Regime and Our Greatest Ally. But one group possibly does benefit from the chaos: those who want to destroy Europe and Western Civilization via mass migration. Human flight from Syria is about to get dialed up to 11. But even the Burn It All Down ghouls may get slipped a green weenie if a new burst of Syrian refugees further inflames European tensions over refugees. The State Department and American intelligence services are without doubt the most dangerous incompetents in world history, and no one seems able to curtail their fuckery.

            Strange that Christian communities in this region stayed intact for over 1000 years under the Ottomans (supposedly a strange and hostile empire of primitive steppe people that toppled the last vestiges of Rome) and precursor states… yet as soon as the West and Fellow-West got its grimy mitts on these regions, the Christians were done for.
I do not say that as a fan of the Ottomans. But they seem to have been far better stewards of this region than whatever this current post-WW1 version of the west is. I guess it is Amalek thinking.

            Unfortunately it seems that the US can stomach an infinite number of Christians being murdered/brutalized.  I don’t recall that kind of thing sparking much outcry in my lifetime, let alone useful policy responses.  Perhaps this is because the (((media))) goes out of its way to memory hole such events.

                Something I dramatically underestimated was the importance of Musk’s acquisition of Twitter/X. The images of the ongoing ethnic cleansing of Gaza have turned people sharply against Israel for the first time in our lives; TikTok is being banned for this reason despite other claims. The unfolding savagery in Syria cannot be hidden, the horror will be blasted out, and that makes it different from previous United States-sponsored Christian genocides. The Regime lost full control of propaganda and that has put it in a precarious position. Public opinion largely doesn’t matter, of course, but some buy in remains necessary.

                    Someinformation that could make one an antisemite is allowed to proliferate on X,someanti-Jewish rhetoric is allowed to ensue, andsomeare allowed to “fight” the resulting “neonazis.”(For example, the account StopAntisemitism, which Elon has granted a special dispensation to dox and threaten other users, sometimes does so using information that hasonlybeen given to X. Anyone care? Hesaidthe purpose of his acquisition of Twitter was to transform it into the site of everyone’s universal digital identity. Yours is “antisemite #933847.”)This state of angry disputation calls for state intervention. So the incoming administration prioritizes he nationalization of Republican states’ recently adopted anti-free-speech laws re: the Jews. In a few months, America will have hate speech laws covering everyoneexceptnon-Jewish white people. We won!Some actors in this show may be unaware of their roles. Elon is a nerd, so he may totally dissociate his fantasy self-image (Tony Stark, free speech crusader) from his true self (bitch on Shapiro’s leash at Auschwitz).

                        The horse has left the barn, but, yeah, that’s the plan however late in the genocide. Elon on Shapiro’s leash is an image not going away soon, as an aside.

                But that’s not a very good explanation. If The Chosen were behind it, why would it serve their interests to memory-hole events that would move the marginal people towards anti-Islam?
If one has to believe in an uber-powerful human foe, muslims are a far better candidate, somehow using their magical powers to convince an increasing number of people that head-choppers are fine people, and that The Chosen are the real foe.

                    I suppose the (convoluted) rationale for this is that The Chosen are backing *these* Muslim head choppers and by the transitive property these are “our” head choppers doing the Lord’s (and by the same property, America’s) work. Of course they’re only a name or alliance change away from being the bad kind of head choppers. Let’s say they cut a deal with Russia, which is quite likely at some point. They instantly become “bad” head choppers. Believe me American Christian Zionists absolutelyarethis stupid.You gotta cut these guys some slack though. I mean what are you supposed to do?NOTchop off heads??? Yeah, right.

                    The head-choppers are no threat to the migration racket nor the war racket. Who runs the migration NGO racket?
Did 2000 synagogues burn down in the last few years?Are rioters marching or is migrant housing being built in Chosen districts?Have yeshivas gone from white to nonwhite?
Are Chosen activists and politicians leading public campaigns against refugees of the neocon wars? Or are they fiercely defending both, while claiming “Chosen most affected”?
“Chosen girls in Rotherham”…yeah, right.

                I wish I could totally blame the media, but the fact is, Christians themselves have totally internalized the commands of their oppressors on this. Christians will rush to defend some Ivy League Jew who got his feelings hurt on campus (there is one who spoke at the RNC and is now becoming a conservative celebrity, despite the fact that he literally said he was a Democrat during his RNC speech), but will not defend dead or oppressed Christians in the Holy Land or Middle East. They will not say a word about Christians getting spit on in Jerusalem. They don’t do it. And, the thing is, if you look at what Jesus said, this is just the most cowardly and craven behavior.

                    Someone really needs to compile a virtue-level chart showing exactly how holy each of the many factions in the ME is from an American Empire PoV. It should probably be an interactive chart that can change in realtime to show who we’re supposed to bomb. They can use it as a screen saver at the State Dept and CIA.

            IMHO the Israelis will benefit mightily.  The military aid from Iran to Hezbollah has been cut off.   Since Israel now has positions in the south of Syria it is only a matter of time until Hezbollah is not able to fight and Israel will take Southern Lebanon to the Litani River.The major Western players don’t care about chaos in central Syria as long as Israel is expanded and the proposed oil pipeline from Qatar and Saudi Arabia to Turkey can be built.    As to “adding a lot of new costs for Israel,” that is never a problem as the U.S. funds anything they need.   Trump will happily print money and/or provide troops for them until the U.S. collapses.

                    I could see Turkey taking about half of Syria in the medium term if they decide to.   If Turkey struck quickly and did not try to over reach too much there is probably not much NATO could do.
I doubt they would try to take on Israel.  At least not in the foreseeable future.

        “In other words, this scheme was obviously stupid, but the main players did it anyway.”Which explains how Western governments got ten million people killed in the trenches between 1914 and 1918 over nothing.The thing about the Deep State is not simply that it has tentacles and spooks trying to pull the strings. It does, and there are plenty of examples.The other main feature of the Deep State — or any exclusionary, hierarchical, bureaucratic structure that dispenses power and money — is that it is insular and self-referential, and anyone who voices a dissenting view is either punished or purged.Hell, it was like that in the academic world, which was supposed to be about the free exchange of ideas! What do you suppose it is like in the military, the intel community, or the State Department? One does not get to bechargé d’affaires or a member of the General Staff by contradicting a superior or by saying “Hey, what if this plan is wrong?”To say that these people are “high on their own supply” is a truism.These types of organizations also select for ideological compliance. The “conservative” approach to almost anything, particularly foreign governments, is to “let sleeping dogs lie” and to “not make the perfect the enemy of the good.”  Sure, there were things about the Assad regime that may have been unsavory, but is a Hobbesian power vacuum any better? Perhaps only if you are an ardent Zionist, or a zealot who believes in the “America is the indispensable nation” bullshit that has to micromanage every single thing in the entire world in the name of democracy and feminism and gay rights.Seems to me that the 19th century British imperialists were a lot better at this than the 21st century American ideological imperialists.

            The Iron Law of Bureaucracy applies just as well to the managerial class. After three years of fighting in Ukraine, conventional wisdom about future wars has not changed inside the Pentagon. The reason is everyone is tuned to defend the system. It is their nature to view heterodox opinions as mortal threats. The same is true in every area of the managerial class.In my youth, I was tasked with fixing a problem department. The main problem was one location that lost money like crazy. I found out that the lease was due to expire in the next year, so I suggested we close the location. It was as if I suggested we all get naked and roll around together. I got my way and they took the credit when it worked.

Good point.
The colleges have been ideological tyrannies of feminism, homo-ism and P.C. for 4 decades now.  This is entrenched and yes, it damn sure WAS and IS a conspiracy.  D.C. is all of that, and ever-so-much more.

        I’ve been calling them The Wizards of Smart for, officially, decades now.The so-called “Arab Spring” (a Bill Kristol / neocon term) ended up causing the worst refugee crisis since ww2.  It also is the main source of various European nationalist movements. At home, “the stimulus” and its “shovel ready” jobs, was another adventure in proving that all the macroeconomic textbooks they hand MBA students are dead wrong.Masks and vaccines and social distancing? Check!Indicting and trying to jail a presidential candidate? Check!Collapsing the Russian government through a proxy war in Ukraine? Check!Just because they’re powerful doesn’t mean they’re smart.

        I don’t disagree with the essay overall, but regarding the famous razor, hasn’t it already been established that there truly is a lot of malice among the decision making class?  Incompetent – yes – but malicious also.  Can’t this be a case of having a little from column A and a little from column B?When the vile Newland (Kaganovich) glibly says things like ‘screw the Europeans’ and stuff about burning up all the Ukrainians like so much worthless cordwood, I am inclined to assume both ill-will and casual/psychopathic disregard for the wellbeing of others.  Maybe ALL others.   Could it be that chaos and mayhem is ‘acceptable’ so they don’t care how much they F up?

            “Incompetent – yes – but malicious also.”
While I acknowledge the usefulness of Hanlon’s Razor as a heuristic to restrain paranoia, it is also has a history of convincing gullible whites to explain away serious threats.
For example, it is probably true that our elites really hate traditional whites and this hatred underlies massive immigration and DEI. Yet most conservatives still deploy their version of Hanlon’s Razor to avoid this awful truth.
The world is complex, outcomes can have many causes, and paranoia rarely helps, but Hanlon’s Razor has probably done more harm than good for traditional whites.

        Hanlon’s razor is a metaphysical assertion, that is – it is not derived from evidence, but is a meta-theory that structures what counts as evidence and how that “evidence” is interpreted.This is always possible – indeed trivially easy to do.A metaphysical assumption can never be disproved by evidence. In practice, once accepted, the Hanlon meta-theory will Always explain-away malice as being instead something else.The effects can be seen in interpersonal life, as well as politics and sociology – when, for instance, the victim of genuinely malicious abuse by a sadist, has no difficulty in explaining it in terms ofincompetence, neglect, or ignorance – to which could be added insanity, or “random” bad luck. There is no end to the number of ways in which people self-blind to evil.Once Hanlon’s razor is accepted, then malice has in practice been ruled-out as a cause, ever and anywhere – and indeed evil itself is eliminated.Hanlon’s razor (implicitly, although seldom stated as an assumption) is one reason why The West has become a willing victim, a civilizational case of Stockholm Syndrome – we have developed an infinite capacity to excuse those who are purposively and strategically destroying us. .The reason why people nowadays spout Hanlon’s razor is related to our society’s deletion of genuine religion (including from the churches). If one doesn’t believe in the *reality* of evil in the world, then clearly each and all possible manifestations of evil Must be explained-away as… something else.

            Interesting views…it recalls when Nietzsche (and no doubt others) that argue that an e.g. a criminal is not guilty of his crime because he was the victim of circumstances beyond his control (or whatever); basically the old free will vs. deterministic arguments, I suppose. For all my love and study of Nietzsche, this is one of his themes I don’t agree with…I personally believe there is something to “free will” and ability to choose. Those who excuse everything to determinism, events beyond an individual’s control are, in my view, being just as dogmatic as the paranoiac who thinks that everything that happens is by some hidden, treacherous power. Both are extremist views making categorical conclusions and from my learning, a categorical claim is most likely to be wrong (simply because it claims to cover all cases) and thus requires the highest burden of proof to be validated. I’m just an amateur at all this but I wager that even if we could agree on a definition of intent/malice/etc. it’s still stupidity/incompetence causing the bulk of mischief in this world.

            Bruce, you add depth to Z-man’s definition.  In fact, both of you are correct, and form a “well rounded“ interpretation.  One that I admit I was missing.From ChatGPT:”…LimitationsWhile Hanlon’s Razor is a helpful principle, it is not a hard rule:•	Some actions are genuinely malicious.•	While the simplest explanation is often incompetence, there are times when malice must be considered, especially in repeated or highly suspicious circumstances.•	It shouldn’t prevent a balanced investigation into motives.Hanlon’s Razor reminds us to approach situations with logic and kindness, rather than jumping to the worst conclusions.“

            Well, another reason it is spouted is because there isn’t much that can be done about it that would not involve high risk to personal status.  Waiting for incompetence to eventually cause its own collapse is a little easier to morally swallow than saying it is evil.  Evil tends to demand a more active response.

                    I’m talking about explicit regime policy and actions. Redlining is a natural flow of investment to areas where it produces a return, and withholding of investment from where it doesn’t. Nothing necessarily to do with the regime itself. Disparate impact is also a natural outcome (I believe we’ve been over that here before).

            This is true, but the flip side is also true — malice on another’s part is impossible for humans to prove because we have no way of knowing what he is thinking.
There is plenty of evil (and Evil) in the world, most assuredly. But there is also plenty of incompetence. I think it comes down to experience. If you are besting incompetence on a daily basis, it’s easy to whip out the Razor.
But if your lived experience is different, and if the other is incompetent…

        Trump’s first major test will be resisting the enormous pressure coming from the usual suspects to bomb Iran. All the Syria episode did was to inform Iran in no uncertain terms (after Libya, Iraq etc) that nuclear weapons must be possessed in order to avoid regime change. And even then, they’re no guarantee (look at that Pakistani dude Mr. Khan in jail). If he gives in and bombs Iran, we will have 4 more years of the usual MIC-sponsored chaos.

                        Hegseth is a Freemason. His Chi-Rho tattoo isn’t because he’s Greek Orthodox. They’re allies of the Zionists and the reason why he has backers coming out of closets everywhere to sell America on our latest “last, best hope for peace” or whatever.
It’s a safe assumption that any politician that has attended an Ivy League, is a member of at least one secret society. Hegseth has three that I know of: Mason, Koch Clan &amp; Bear Stearns alumnus.
“What friends did you make along your path to political success?” is not an idle question.

            I think he will.  Iran is just another endless war project.  He’s more likely to strangle them economically and use the monetary savings to rebuild this country, pay for deportations, and replenish military stockpiles.
Considering how many of our weapons didn’t do much good in Ukraine, which weapons get replenished might get some scrutiny.

        What’s also interesting to watch is the responses. Moscow quickly made a deal with HST to allow the Russian forces free passage to their bases on the coast, and to keep the bases until Putin decides whether they’re worth keeping. The Israelis took some more of the Golan Heights. The Turks are obsessed with the Kurds. The Iranians went home and are getting even closer to Moscow. The Biden regime is cynically taking credit for bringing “freedom” to Syria, while creating even more chaos before they leave. Trump? Who knows?

            The Russian response has been interesting. They are far more concerned with the Turks screwing around in the Caucuses. They might be thinking that a civil war in Syria will draw the Islamists from the Caucuses out of the mountains and into Syria. The collapse of Syria could be a blessing in disguise, if they play their cards right.

                I’m inclined to think so, if only for the reason that a lot of people seem to think that these rebels will become compliant little American and Bagel lapdogs for some cash and prizes from the Clowns In Action. These guys are not idiots, since they see what trusting the Americans gets you in the failed states of the region. There’s every chance that the new Syrian rulers will be exactly like the mujahedeen in Afghanistan, who defeated the Soviets and then turned on the Americans.

That is what we got from Iraq after the US got rid of Saddam Hussein, and despite the fact that, on paper, Iraq is far closer to Iran today and somewhat of a client state, the neocons still point to this operation as a proud accomplishment. This tells me that they feel it benefitted Israel, and I am positive that they feel they can handle the post-Assad situation in Syria in much the samer way (and they might be right). Best case scenario for them, lots of people in Syria leave and go to the US and Europe and trigger another migration crisis.These dynamics will continue for as long as they don’t. Until these people get put in their place and suffer a brutal, humiliating loss that signals the end, they’ll keep doing it.

                The current border crisis here is of their own doing – as such I suppose one could actually consider the US government as a foreign state sponsor, as they certainly don’t ever do anything that’s in the best interests of the actual country of America.

        There was a big thread up on reddit the last couple days about the “Hippie Trail,” the route more or less from London to Bangkok or Australia, through the Middle East, to include Syria, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Kashmir, Kathmandu, etc. Immortalized by Men At Work (“on a hippie trail head full of zombie”)Numerous replies from old hippies about their experiences traveling it as young backpackers. The thing that came up over and over was how, back when this was a thing, in the 60s and 70s, it was generally a free and easy passage, with the people and governments in places like Syria, Iran and Afghanistan being friendly to westerners, and laments about how that has changed, and thus it is no longer advisable or usually even possible for a young westerner to travel the route. Unacknowledged was why: the fact that this changed because the GAE became the Evil Empire and bombed and abused these people on behalf of Our Greatest Ally. Reddit being a very Slava Ukraini kind of place, calling the GAE the Evil Empire is verboten. Even if they tend to be sympathetic to Palestinians there.What struck me was that the changing of the GAE’s status, it’s transition from being seen as a more benevolent force to being seen as an oppressor, was happening right in front of us all that time, and most of “us” didn’t really even notice it, until it was a very far advanced. Indeed, looking around reddit, a great many still haven’t noticed.Growing up, I was taught nonsense about how they hated us because they were muslim fanatics, and hated us for our “freedom.” The people pushing that message had to deliberately ignore and suppress the very recent past of US relations with the ME, when they didn’t hate us. Now, breaking countries for fun is just what the GAE does, because it can, like a child playing with toy soldiers (which ironically is no longer allowed in the GAE, because it’s clown world).

        We now learn from Alistair Crooke that when Assad flew to Moscow to meet with Putin the day before the terrorists struck, Putin informed Assad that Russia and Iran would not be coming to save his bacon. When Assad returned to Damascus, he had already made up his mind to abdicate…without informing anyone. He instructed his military commanders to stand down and prepare for a regime change. We all watched this unfold. On his last day in office, Assad told his prime minister to prepare a speech to be read to the public the next day informing them of his decision to hand over the government. No such speech was ever written and Assad simply gathered his family and left for Moscow that same afternoon. Even some of Assad’s cousins were caught by surprise and eventually murdered by the terrorist goons a few days later. Russia and Iran appear to have prepared for a collapse a little sooner than the West.

            That’s an important detail.  The Russians had been pressuring Assad to adopt some some of federalized system for some time.  It’s not hard to imagine this was brought to a head at that last meeting, with Assad being unwilling, unable, or, most likely, both.

        American elites do not simply undertake poorly thought out schemes that sometimes blow up in their faces. They deliberately choose the worst possible course of action and then keep at it until itdoesblow up in their faces. The timing may be accidental, but the result isn’t. Russia supported Baathist-led Syria because it was in the interests of any Western government to do so. Leave it to Iran to back the Shiite minority, and the Arab Gulf states the Sunni majority. Even from a humanitarian perspective, the minority Alawite government best protected the interests of other, more Western-friendly Christian and Druze sects from Sunni domination. Then there is the question of why the United States would get involved in a country like Syria in the first place. If it’s about Syria’s modest oil reserves, wouldn’t it make more sense toseize a geographically tiny petroleum-rich state like Bahrain on Chevron’s behalf? As in Ukraine, American Middle East policy is dominated by an alien elite, driven by ancient hatreds, who will inevitably end up undermining the nation they can never fully identify with.

            But what does “blow up in their face” even mean? They never face any actual consequences to their horrible decisions. They continue to live lives of plenty in beautiful towns, send their kids to the best schools, command a great deal of credibility and respect in the circles they run, etc. Other people pay the price, and it just so happens that it is USUALLY people who they hate and want destroyed. They rarely even get criticized or face any accountability whatsoever – one of the best aspects of managerialism (for them) is that you can always pawn off your horrible decisions to the morass.Until you start hanging these people for treason, espionage for a foreign nation, etc., then whether or not it blows up in their face is totally irrelevant.

        The Dissidents are woefully blind when it comes to world “real-geopolitik”.Of course this is all deliberate – and to some extent – controlled and directed.Theres a meme that cracks me up on Blab where the CIA is funding Al-Quieda, some other American three-letter agency is funding ISIS…and the American tax payer is in the middle of it with a stupid look on his face wondering what in hell is going on.The goal of all this is to deliberately induce chaos in the Arab world. If the rag heads are fighting each other – then they aren’t fighting us – or our (((greatest friends and allies))). This has been a cornerstone and foundation of neocon policy for 60 years now. It’s a great deal for everyone. Jewish enemies in disarray are much less a threat, the Yanks and Russians make a literal and figurative killing on arms sales, and savvy politicos grandstand for the cameras posing as heroes as tempers flare and blood flows. It doesn’t really matter who the villains are – they all read from the same script.If you sit on your hands and/or walk away… what happens? Welp – the Arabs will fight, the power vacuums will fill, alliances will forge, and then  – horrors!!! – they’ll start to unify. All of a sudden the Israelis have not only Iran, but Iraq, Saudi Arabia and easily half the Arab world unified against them, and acting collaboratively against them. Other nations – likely even Turkey – will fall in. If THAT happens, they’ll start buying their weapons from the Russians and now the chinks as well. More nightmare fuel – they’ll probably align economically, en masse, with the BRICS. Donald Trump understands this, which is why he’s making some of the questionable appointments he has. In real world terms none of that is good for any of us in real terms.Throwing endless monkey wrenches into Middle East politics made great economic and strategic sense to everyone except the Arabs. This is why Gulf War 1 and 2 were fought. Having two wars doubled the profits. Rest assured the Usual Suspects are present here, they’re still making a fortune… but the world is changing.The Arabs are getting wise. Precision weapons are now available at bargain basement prices and even free to preferred customers – that can put the run on the US Navy. Economic power houses from the BRICS are now at work in the region and they have interests for and against the status quo too. The pressure on Arab leaders to put differences aside and unify and do something permanent about Israel is enormous.using organized chaos to undermine your enemies is an unrecognized WMD in our times.  Unfortunately none of us have leaders capable of wielding it anymore… and the argument can be made that we’ve loosed it on ourselves, as have our (((allies))).lest I be accused of antisemitism allow me to quote our good jewish friend, Hosea: “those that sew the wind will reap the whirlwind…”Interesting times are upon us.

If unification were remotely plausible, it would have probably happened sometime after the death of Mohamed in the 7th century. The only thing that seems to have “united” Sunni and Shia to any extent is Gaza. And that’s just because the Exploding Mohameds hate Jews worse than they hate each other.

                    Muslims invented nothing. How could they? Being a low-IQ tribal raiding group who first conquered lots of higher IQ (but pozzed) people in the Byzantine Empire, then built al-Andalus with lots of Western European slaves courtesy of the Viking Slave trade, and the glories of Baghdad by lots of Eastern European slaves courtesy of the Vikings also (mostly the Swedes).The zero: India. Algebra (conquered Greeks). Writing: the modern alphabet is traced back to the Phoenicians. No Muslim ever farmed if he could have a foreign slave do it for him. Indeed no Muslim ever did a lick of work anytime anywhere if he could get a foreign slave period.Even the greatest architectural wonders in the Muslim world are converted Christian Cathedrals.And to this day, the Muslim contribution to science, literature, music, movies etc. is zero. All they invented was the underwear bomb and butt plug bomb.

If you have secure borders and possess an in-group preference that relegates the rest of the species to the status of animals, then bloody internecine chaos on your border may be preferable to independent, functioning nation states on your border.

            If they all didn’t deserve to die in a fire, you almost could feel sorry for Regime propagandists. People do indeed openly laugh at them now, and that is far more damaging than protests and terror in the long run. The British and Soviets weren’t this ludicrous as their empires slipped away.

        More good analysis and cautionary wisdom to be gleaned from current events. But what has changed as a result? A deeper understanding of the mess we’re in. Is that good enough? Why not reference an actual example of a current event that was consequential? United Healthcare employed AI software to deny medical claims at a whooping rate of over 34%; far higher than the insurance industry average of 15%. Luigi put in dent in that problem. That was no trivial impact.

        Z has restated the Hanlon’s Razor definition I’m most familiar with, replacing “stupidity” with “incompetence, neglect, or ignorance”. That’s acceptable as far as it goes, but I suggest he’s omitted other important base desires that lead to trouble such as greed. I’ve seen a similar rule with the terms “greed, sloth and stupidity.” It curious to note that of those three, only stupidity is not a cardinal sin. Apparently God is OK with stupidity.

Who will come in on humanitatian grounds to restore order.  they will Carve syria up between them, as uncle sam nods approvingly, giving them billions in “humanitarian funds to help with their mission” .

            OUR budget, and as for the Israelis not being happy with having a new border with takfiris, recall that Israel created (not indirectly, but directly with organizational and financial support) Hamas to serve as a focus for Palestinian resistance to weaken the PLO.The Israelis indirectly created Hezbollah. They invaded Lebanon in 1982, drove the PLO out, then didn’t leave. The Lebanese were initially no unhappy to see the departing backsides of the Palestinians, but then when the Jews made no efforts to go home after the mission was accomplished, the Lebanese were like “oh, shit. we are the new Palestinians.” Local resistance eventually coalesced into Hezbollah. If the Jews hadn’t tried to grab south Lebanon, there would be no Hezbollah.So while the Israelis are happy about this state of affairs now, it WILL come to bite them on the ass. Anyone who thinks the takfiri aren’t dreaming of driving to Jerusalem is an idiot. That’s where expendable stupid Christian white boys from their American colony come in. Don’t enlist unless you want to die for Israel’s new water sources up to the Litani River (if they can swing it), and their newly acquired natural gas and oil deposits off the coasts of Gaza and (if they can swing it) ex-south Lebanon. They want us roped into permanent war against the enemies they have created, again.
