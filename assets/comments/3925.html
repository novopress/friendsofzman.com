        My favorite term in government is gridlock.  Thank god they can’t agree on much, we couldn’t take much more.  The conservative caucus needs to stand firm and those who do not join need to be singled out for a primary challenge and get gone.  It may take a few cycles but only by keeping track of voting records and purging rhinos do we stand a chance. John Boehner is a terribly weak speaker with no charisma and no ability to unify the party.  What a shame.

        I don’t see the referenced article as interesting. He sounds like a Beltway twat on a Sunday show. If the Republican sniveling is as bad as he makes out–not saying it isn’t–it’s time for conservatives, all 52 of them, to piss all over the Republicrats, and very publicly. It is better for them to announce to their districts that they are going home and giving DC to Harry and Barry than participate in this charade. Sovietized internet, illegal amnesty with unearned billions in tax payouts, gun control by edict, secret treaties with nuclear Iran. Just go home. Harry Reid, never the sharpest tool and now senile, is running things anyway. Republicans are the kitty litter. If they go home maybe the  smell of shit will wake people up.

        One can argue our tripartite form of Government is set up to create and foster ‘awful, ineffectual’ politicians. It’s better to have pols do as little as necessary to keep the system running, but no more, and piss off both sides  than be overzealous. Looking back at history, governments and politicians that were too effective tended to be really awful.

            I think there’s a difference between incremental and incompetent. By design, the federal system is supposed to be incremental. Boehner is just a boob in way over his head. I think his very serious drinking problem is the issue. You can’t be drinking at lunch every day and be on top of your game. Tip liked his whiskey, but he started at the end of business, not the end of breakfast.
