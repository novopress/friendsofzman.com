        Most people cannot compose a post worth reading.
Far fewer could put together a single podcast.
But to do it day after day?
That‚Äôs what happens when gifts are combined with gumption, you magnificent bastard.

        Big thanks and congrats! Not sure how I stumbled upon the Z-Man but glad that I did. Z fills the niche between Sailer‚Äôs Boomer Debate Team ‚Äì which keeps hoping to convince David Brooks types to lay off the white goys ‚Äì and Vox Day‚Äôs Countdown to Armageddon.
This is where dissidents are trying to figure out what to actually do on the ground day to day. That‚Äôs what we need most and Z ‚Äì and the commentators ‚Äì are doing more than any other site to work that out. Big thanks to all.

            Agreed, but can‚Äôt help but to notice that the commenters here are in many respects more vocal/strident/advanced wrt to certain core dissident issues concerning race and HBD than our host.  Heretofore, I‚Äôve given the benefit of the doubt wrt such reticence to perhaps a (wise) strategy in keeping a lowered profile in the heavily censored blogosphere.  Perhaps our host would comment.

                Just a guess, but I‚Äôd suspect Z wants us focused on recruitment (and he‚Äôs right). Recruiting normies takes a gentle hand. They can only handle so much as a time.That‚Äôs why Sailer remains a very important figure. He may frustrate many of us (myself included) with his unwillingness to move forward, but he‚Äôs great for getting normies to start thinking our issues.We should all try to remember where our brains were five, ten or even 20 years ago. We likely weren‚Äôt ready for a full on dosage of race reality and its political and cultural implications. Z knows that.

                It‚Äôs funny, but I never think about pulling punches or self-censoring. I‚Äôm a cold hearted race realist, but when presented in a reasonable way, these observations and the arguments that rise from them sound quite reasonable. That‚Äôs because they are reasonable.

                    I accept that and am reassured.  I suspect that my concern/puzzlement stems from often reading blog comments here that seem easily answered in the context of HBD knowledge, but that is not as often brought up as I would expect.This site‚Äôs popularity is growing and I‚Äôm seeing new posters every day.  I‚Äôm not sure (as Citizen sagely noted) if such understanding is equally shared/understood among your followers.  However, as I believe Jared Taylor noted a while back on one of his podcasts, the essential communality across dissident right factions is an underlining understanding and acceptance of race differences and HBD science.I also understand that you must be your own man to make this blog a success.  üòâ

                    Like many who discover the truth about race, I‚Äôve become far more sympathetic and understanding toward other groups, particularly blacks, i.e. race realism actually lowers your antipathy toward other groups rather than increases it.Once you understand that blacks are being asked to do something which they are genetically unable to do ‚Äì be white ‚Äì you realize the futility and cruelty of it. The same is true of asking white kids to grind all day on their homework like NE Asian kids.Of course, understanding the truth about race also means you can‚Äôt avoid reaching the conclusion that people are happiest and societies run best when we live among our own and are ruled by our own.I may be more sympathetic towards blacks, but I‚Äôm even more determined to avoid them.

                            Oh yea. Blacks are dangerous, really dangerous. But so are certain types of snakes, bears, sharks, etc. Just because I don‚Äôt hate grizzly bears doesn‚Äôt mean I want to be close to one. I also don‚Äôt want any of those animals ‚Äì any of them ‚Äì in my neighborhood or near my children.
I would gladly wipe out a bear population to keep my people safe. I would feel a little bad about having to do it, but I wouldn‚Äôt think twice about doing it and wouldn‚Äôt regret doing for a minute.

They‚Äôre about as subversive to the establishment as a Denny‚Äôs menu.

                        I don‚Äôt hate blacks but I sure don‚Äôt want any of them to live near me or deal with them. I learned in high school exactly how violent and unpredictable blacks are.
Race riots tend to open ones eyes.
As for the rest I agree with it.  It is indeed foolish to ask white kids to duplicate NE Asian study habits. We didn‚Äôt need to do that to get to the Moon or invent more of the technology we use today.

                            I wasn‚Äôt implying whites weren‚Äôt as smart as NE Asians, just making a point that while blacks can‚Äôt be white neither can whites be Asian, nor would we or blacks want to be. As Z notes, blacks are very happy being black and don‚Äôt really like living around whites much. (Though they do like our stuff.)My guess on the white-Asian brain question is that NE Asians seem to have a bit of an average edge in math and a definite edge in willingness to work longer hours. However, whites are better at letting their minds wander and challenge the dictates of the time. It‚Äôs cliche but seems to be true.

                        A friend of one of my sons has shared some memos the local medicos are sending around to warn doctors and hospitals to be prepared for serious injuries tomorrow night, due to some huge rap concert in one North Dallas suburban city nearby.  The concert ‚Äústars‚Äù have known gang ties, drug convictions, etc.  It will draw every Negro for at least 50 miles ‚Äì and I guarantee the cops are NOT giving a heads up to the residents so they could stay home and keep their teens safe.  I also expect any resulting mayhem to be buried by local news.Avoidance ‚Äì and vigilance ‚Äì is indeed the best strategy.

        Unlike the American Centennial, which marked the downfall of America 1.0, the Z-blog Centennial marks major progress toward a future summit.I first encountered Z on KMG‚Äôs ‚ÄúGrace &amp; Steele‚Äù when I was falling from neocon grace. His third position between what would later be called the Alt-Lite and the Anglin/Spencer Right has turned out to be a pretty comfortable ideological and cultural space, and I plan to stick around. Thanks for opening that gate, Z.  Your dependabity in both the schedule and quality of your posting shows a balance of talent, audience appreciation and work ethic that only a White man can bring to the table  Sorry/not sorry to Chosen and Han grinders, but this White synergy beats your single-digit IQ advantage every time ‚Äì consult the scoreboard of history.Your example will inform and inspire my own future efforts. We‚Äôre all part of a web that stretches from points between ‚Äúhere there be Stormers‚Äù and ‚Äúhere there be Shapiros.‚Äù  It would be an honor to be a node for a few more based Whites to follow back to here.Thank you, sir.

        I remember the old ‚Äúassimilation‚Äù story well,  My parents would introduce the kids to new people at church who escaped from wherever and couldn‚Äôt be more grateful.  Their best friends were Armenians whose families got out of Turkey in the nick of time.  My school Guidance Counselor literally ran out of Hungary when the Soviets invaded.  All assimilated with gratitude,
Now I‚Äôm supposed to assimilate to weird strangers who can‚Äôt stop bitching about me and the U.S.  I can‚Äôt imagine a better way to generate resentment towards immigrants and eventually get the borders closed.

            Drake. You touch on a point I‚Äôve pondered upon before.  Prior to the last few decades, I too ran into the occasional immigrant, usually with the same story of fleeing an oppressive situation.  And it was always in the context of a success story.  Made everyone feel good about themselves.  Lots of Christian churches would adopt them like pets.So I asked myself, why all the problems now?  My conclusion is that in those times, wholesale admittance of any and all was not de rigor, and numbers were limited.  Also there was a selection bias wrt the level of immigrant‚Äîhigher education, more motivation/skills and less ties back to the ‚Äúold‚Äù country.Once you admit folks with no ability/skill to succeed in a 1st world country (heck, they couldn‚Äôt succeed in their third world country) and then admit a sizable number of them.  They naturally form a grouping and ghetto(ize).  Even ‚Äúdropping them off‚Äù around the country does no good, as they are allowed to freely relocate.  At that point, it‚Äôs pretty much game over and we have an alien society within/undermining a host society such as Z-man noted in today‚Äôs podcast.

        Well, we appreciate what you‚Äôre doing. It can get pretty lonely for people who see what‚Äôs going on, but don‚Äôt have anybody around them who also see it.For Johnny-come-latelies to your site, some kind of ‚Äúgreatest hits‚Äù would be useful. You wouldn‚Äôt have to do it all at once. Heck, you could even make a placeholder post linking to a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù article on Saturday or Sunday when, it appears, you sometimes take a day off. (How do you create so much content, anyway?)Having once worked in ‚Äúrespectable‚Äù publishing, I know that publishers aredesperatefor anybody with any kind of name recognition or established audience. I don‚Äôt know what the numbers for dissident publishing look like, but I would be astounded if you pitched an anthology to Counter Currents, Arktos, etc. and they said no.

            I started with this mic:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D4HTIOY/I use Audacity, which is free and there are tons of how-to sites and video for it. In a few hours you can be a pro.Last year, I upgraded the mic to a Blue Yeti and upgraded the sound card on my PC. That made the sound quality better, but not too professional sounding. I think you can over do the professionalism side. Podcasts are suppose to informal.I record in my bedroom. Close the door and make sure the cat is fed, so he is not making noise. With Audacity, there is a feature to clean up background noise, so you just have to run that option and it cleans up the room noise pretty well.

            My advice on blogging is to avoid the platforms like Blogger and WordPress. Got to Epik and register your domain and get a hosting plan. The $10/mo option is fine to get started. One of their customer service reps will help you set up WordPress on your site. That way, you are free from doxxing, shutdowns, DDodS and all that. The people running Epik and free speech and privacy zealots.As far as material, post something every day, even if it is just a couple of paragraphs. That way, you get better and you get into the habit of running a blog. If after a few months it is no longer fun, you‚Äôre out a hundred bucks and you learned something about yourself.

                The idea that two Brit ships could both ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù stray into Iranian waters is dubious even if you account for the tragic state of the Royal Navy.  Regardless, the de-Anlicizing and outright dismantling of the British Navy is a perfect microcosm of the selling of Western tradition by the pound by feeble-souled grifters who aren‚Äôt fit to lick, much less stand in, the boots of their ancestors.

                    Which gets back to Trump wrt the EU countries actually pulling their own weight in defense expenditures.  Unfortunately, as with many other Trump initiatives, this too seems a flash in the pan.  When even Britain is too feeble to deter a weak navy such as fielded by Iran, then you know we are in trouble.  The EU is nothing more than a liability for us.

                            Germany has no functioning military and this is well documented.
Neither does Austria, Denmark,Sweden or Norway.
They are paper forces with no self-defense capability.
Britain has been so busy downsizing it‚Äôs military and spending what funds they do have on worthless high tech weapons like nuke subs they no longer have the ability to project force or deploy more than a Army brigade.
We saw the war on Libya by Europe that they could not prosecute the war without American help. They are that weak.

                        After the interdiction of the Iranian tanker for ostensibly breaking the Syrian oil blockade, I have no problem believing Iran would retaliate. I don‚Äôt see what American interest is served by blockading either Syria or Iran at this point.  To the extent even a fully-nuclear Iran would be a geostrategic threat, it would be to Europe, which at least continentally seems uninterested at best in saber-rattling with Iran. Geostrategically, Israel, the most obviously threatened nation, is much less significant than they would have us believe.  Absent its Israeli baggage, Arab nations would be more amenable to American interests, not less, so the idea that Israel is a necessary counter inside the Arab world is a self-serving one on Israel‚Äôs part. I don‚Äôt support Israel‚Äôs downfall, but I would like to see them stand on their own after significant US disentanglement (not gonna happen, OFC).(((Somebody))) is pulling strings in DC through their puppet Bolton to see that the one country which is hell-bent on war with Iran gets its way (as usual).

                            Exile, I think the Arab states would be more ‚Äúaligned‚Äù with American interests, rather than ‚Äúamenable‚Äù.  Not to be ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù, but I think the distinction is important.  Nations align when their own self interests are served by the alignment, and part ways when their interests don‚Äôt align.  Amenability is more a lefty thing, because it is all about feelings, and alignment/pure self-interest is more a righty thing, because it is all about hard-headed rationality.  Trump and Boris are definitely hard-headed self-interest types (as is Xi).

        Great show, Z.Isn‚Äôt it amazing how there are American cities WORSE than Cape Town?  It‚Äôs hard to imagine that Detroit was once called the Paris of the West. Today it is just a giant run down black dystopia of crime and violence where white boys get beat to death over a fender bender.If our elites had any sense, the African population explosion wouldn‚Äôt be happening, because we wouldn‚Äôt be feeding them, and even if it were, would be entirely their problem. We wouldn‚Äôt need to ‚Äúdo‚Äù anything.I would forgive Trump if he had brought in the usual suspects like Bolton in the very beginning, but then replaced them later on. After all, his win was entirely unexpected and he needed to govern. But if he truly wants to make a difference, he must get rid of these people.  I always wondered why he didn‚Äôt bring Buchanan in.Pulling out of the Iraq deal made a North Korean deal impossible.  After all, if a new incoming president can just end deals made the previous administration all deals are inherently temporary. They have already been burned by later administrations in the past. They made a deal with Clinton and then Bush broke it.  Let us hope Trump‚Äôs instincts remain good.

        Never forget that Boris Johnson was part of the cabinet, headed by David Cameron, whose intelligence service set up the scheme to unseat the Trump candidacy.Remember Cameron himself (who was closer to Johnson than he ever was to May) publicly said that Trump was unfit to be President.  I don‚Äôt have the slightest doubt that Johnson was aware of what was going on at the time.  And I presume Trump knows it.Trump needs friends and so was publicly willing to hold his nose and associated with May, but Johnson might be different.  Farage, for instance, hates his guts.The Conservative Party remain, at bottom, a bunch of Churchill creeps.

        Z.Congrats.Catching up here; I politely take exception that Trump has been outmaneuvered by everyone in DC.   For one thing he bloodlessly defeated the same coup that bought down Nixon (and Mossadegh among others) and avoided so far the ensuing Civil War.  Trump doesn‚Äôt like Blood.  Some here may disagree (like me). But his purpose has prevailed.Iran;  it is perhaps difficult to understand for outsiders to governance and war the pressures the modern President must withstand to avoid war.  In particular a Republican and especially Trump (who ah until this week was facing a coup and needed military support).  Trump is holding off from war quite well.You belittle unjustly his success with North Korea.Of course the Wall is not built.This being of course major discontent.   Justly from the citizen to our government, unjustly to Trump.Brings me to my main point;You greatly I believe overestimate the powers of any President ever, never mind the modern President with the entire government and elite in opposition.  Indeed mutiny.Sir we have yet to have a true dictator President.  Even FDR or Lincoln with wartime powers could not have worked the magic results desired by so many.  In truth no election in my estimate will solve this, or all the elections.   We prevailing would require either total capitulation by the Left ‚Äì unlikely given their nature, size and fragmented composition ‚Äì OR‚Ä¶ we prevail through War.I don‚Äôt say we must fight because I thirst for my neighbors blood.  I am resigned that its probably unavoidable.   They can‚Äôt surrender, we don‚Äôt want to die by going extinct through replacement.Some of you may want to consider they may less want us dead as NEED us dead.  That it‚Äôs their survival that‚Äôs on the line.   That this isn‚Äôt about power or greed anymore ‚Äì it‚Äôs about survival.  The Left may need us dead just to survive our reckoning.   They certainly behave as desperate men throwing all caution to the wind.   We do NOT behave as if it‚Äôs a struggle to survive.It is always to the death when one side decides it is, whether the other wills this extreme or no.    They want to live.Do the rest of you?

        I wasn‚Äôt aware that the fundamental assumption regarding our evolutionary backstory‚Äî that all modern humans outside of Africa, are descended from a single group of people who left out of Africa many years ago‚Äî has been seriously questioned.I know there‚Äôs been some questioning regarding the chronology‚Äî was it 50,000 years ago, 60,000 years ago, or perhaps even much longer?And it‚Äôs clear that our ancestors weren‚Äôt the first proto-human or archaic-human group to escape Africa‚Äî Neanderthals and other groups preceded us, and there was some inter-breeding between Neanderthals and our homo sapien ancestors: many European people, myself included, possess a smattering of Neanderthal genes.But as far as I‚Äôm aware, the main narrative‚Äî that all people of non-African ancestry are descended from one small group of people who escaped Africa in the distant past, and went on to settle the rest of the planet‚Äî has not been seriously challenged..

                That‚Äôs amusing, but not accurate.
Genetically, the largest gap dividing various human groups, is the gap between those whose ancestors left out of Africa ~ 50-60,000 years ago; and those‚Äî like present-day Somalis‚Äî whose ancestors remained in Africa.
So no: we‚Äôre not descended from the Somalis. Rather, we and the Somalis occupy parallel branches on the evolutionary tree: we and the Somalis are both descended from the proto-humans who inhabited East Africa hundreds of thousands of years ago..

            @Kevin Knox. What!?  Albert Einstein said: ‚ÄúAnyone who doesn‚Äôt take truth seriously in small matters cannot be trusted in large ones either.‚Äù Here‚Äôs my advice to everyone one this website. The ideologically bound aren‚Äôt interested in the facts, just pushing the narrative. Politically Correct, Postmodernist indoctrination has warped their perceptions completely and for good. They are simply not capable of distinguishing the difference between their doctrinaire fantasies from straightforward reality. It is an absolute waste of our precious time and energy to try and reason with these kinds of people. In fact, they love it when you try, so they can scream at you and spit in your face. Confrontation gives them a thrill. So  just stop, turn away, and let the heathen rage. Here is a short Youtube vid I‚Äôve posted before. KGB defector Yuri Bezmenov‚Äôs warning to America.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bX3EZCVj2XANow remember, this was back in the 1980s.
