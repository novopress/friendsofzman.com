        I browse the Daily Sceptic‚Äôs ‚ÄúNews Roundup.‚ÄùFor Janauary 5, here are some selected highlights. They are particularly relevant to today‚Äôs essay.‚ÄúJeffrey Epstein ran sex blackmail operation for intelligence agencies, new evidence suggests‚Äù ‚Äì Unsealed documents offer new evidence that Jeffrey Epstein was working with the U.S. intelligence services to blackmail powerful individuals, albeit to mysterious ends, write Alex Gutentag and Michael Shellenberger on the Public Substack.‚ÄùNote the assertion that it must have been US intelligence, not some other nation‚Äôs, perhaps a certain nation on the east coast of the Mediterranean?‚ÄúJeffrey Epstein and the never-ending quest for evil‚Äù ‚Äì For how much longer are people going to believe that paedo cults are the secret puppet masters of our lives, asks Brendan O‚ÄôNeill in Spiked.‚ÄùGeez, talk about naming the Devil and then ridiculing his existence. Actually O‚ÄôNeill is being clever here. If the honey pot hypothesis is correct, then strictly speaking it‚Äôs NOT the child-diddlers at fault, it‚Äôs the spooks who engage in blackmail and extortion against public figures who are the ‚Äúpuppet masters‚Äù.Can you say ‚Äúlimited hangout?‚Äù I knew you could!https://dailysceptic.org/2024/01/05/news-round-up-1028/

        The real story of Epstein is not that underage boys and girls were being sex trafficked.  The real story is that Israel has been running a long term espionage and blackmail operation which has enlarged many of Americas most prominent citizens including those in government.  This cannot be emphasized enough.  The normies are getting distracted by the irrelevant salaciousness it.  But that‚Äôs not the story.  The story is that Israel is systematically blackmailing most of our elites probably as part of an initiation before they even get major funding and media support.  The Jewish race is effectively a hostile international crime syndicate.

            So most of our ‚Äúelites‚Äù are shitty people, who knew? üòâ
Now you know why everything gets worse year by year.  A decade ago i was reading a book from the 1960‚Äôs about the Roman empire written by a Soviet of all people.  It was very interesting.  But he asked a question towards the end ‚Äúwhere had all the good men gone?‚Äù.  He came to the conclusion that they were still in Rome, but that the system no longer selected for them.  Make of that what you will.

        I am the contrarian here, so my take is that:1. The Epstein list being partially published is a fight as noted by others here between Hillary and Obama.2. Per the great philosopher Emilio Estevez, ‚ÄúThat Was Then, This Is Now‚Äù with ethno-centricity.Taking the last first, it is my belief backed up by what I observe that ethno-centricity is being replaced by a GLOBAL racial identity, anti-White (mostly) and very tenuously, White. With the exceptions of the Chinese, perhaps the Japanese and Koreans, and most (not all) Hispanics.This is the triumph of Lennonism. John not Vladimir Ilych. Imagine there‚Äôs no countries. And the goey soft idiocy of Yoko‚Äôs screechings is not what replaces it, but the GLOBAL team: Team anti-White, and very beginnings of Team White. Who you belong to is a function of your skin color and birth. Outside Rachel Dolezal and Talcum X (Sean King) very few can pass for non-White, and there is always the danger of being outed. Upper Class White women can be and are adjacent as ‚Äúallies‚Äù but that‚Äôs it. (((Certain people))) thought they could play on the Team Anti-White but Oct 7 showed that was no longer possible.What concern did BLM in Chicago have over Hamas? How was that part of their lives? Considering most of their money came from (((certain people))) ? Yet reflexively they had to tweet their support for Hamas because they are Team Anti-White. Same with students at Harvard (not a single straight White male among the Hamasistan protestors but plenty of various non-Whites and White women). Same with Muslims world-wide. What do they care about Palestinians / Hamas? About as much as I care about Ukraine or Russia either one.But the removal of national identity does not equate to the Colors of Benetton. Rather it creates a GLOBAL anti-White identity, or very beginnings of a global White identity. When every non-White expresses their very vigorous desire to kill all the White people, around the globe, it creates a shared identity among Whites from Ireland to Poland to Norway. THAT I think is what is missed. I don‚Äôt think (((certain people))) will have their own identity anymore, they will not be able to do again what say, Britain did in the late 1930s and early 1940s with David Niven and the late Christopher Lee (both spies and influencers for Britain in the US along with Ian Fleming. The Nationalism and (((ethnic feeling))) simply won‚Äôt be there any more, replaced with the Global Teams.As for the first item, this looks like Obama issuing a brush-back on Hillary. She had been called in by the Bidens who lack a political machine to stave off the hard-left run by Soros: the invasion of the DNC, the White House protests including staffers, etc. Obama is Team anti-White, no doubt, and that is why he has issued the brush-back pitch to Hillary. Also the Pritzkers, one of whom was found to have had multiple underage ‚Äúencounters‚Äù let us say. The other is Governor of Illinois. After all, why release this stuff now? And why release Clinton and Pritzker ?My read on this is that the hard, Soros Left is in total control of the Judiciary and FBI, and they will not tolerate any Team White action by anybody. (((Certain people))) are now Team White btw. Just in case you missed it. Part of that is the desire of the Vibrant as predictable as the Calendar to push out (((certain people))) from positions of power. Being a studio head, or I-Bank head, or Hedge Fund manager is a cushy gig, and they want it. If (((certain people))) were all sewage inspectors they‚Äôd be Team anti-White as no one would want their jobs and all that goes with it: the money, ‚Äúopportunities‚Äù etc.And that is a big problem, for other Regime elements. They understand they will be next in the Terror, they are looking around for a Napoleon. One who will promise them Great Successes. Nikki Haley aka Nimrata Randhawa? She can‚Äôt even fight off the King Cobra in a debate. For anyone not on Team Soros aka Team Anti-White, its Trump or nothing.[Yes I know its deplorable, what Mossad then the CIA did setting up Epstein and protecting him, the CIA very much in the latter stages. As an adult I expect the very worse of intelligence and government and thus am never disappointed.]

            I‚Äôve been getting the feeling the fix is in for Haley in New Hampshire and South Carolina. I keep seeing things in my news feed touting Haley, saying she‚Äôs in ‚Äústriking distance.‚Äù I went looking for polls, and found that the most recent one (which incidentally showed a 30 pt  Orange lead, I guess that‚Äôs striking distance) was published on Dec. 21. For a primary that‚Äôs on Jan. 23. For South Carolina, primary date Feb. 3, there hasn‚Äôt been a published poll since Dec. 8. You‚Äôd think that with these primaries only weeks away the polls would be coming hot and heavy.So while I agree with your general premise, I‚Äôm not seeing the tribe rallying to the Orange banner. Seems to me like they‚Äôve chosen their horse, and it ain‚Äôt him.

Upper Class White Women (and even non-upper class) will always be tolerated because White women are the most attractive.

        That‚Äôs what the #resistance was during the Trump years.  Back in 2017 I called them a 5th column.  Like Zman, I learned where the term might have originated.In the unlikely event that someone who ever agrees with us gets elected POTUS, recognizing and destroying this 5th column in the federal bureaucracy will be of paramount importance.It will be interesting to see if the public ever gets told that Israel was the foreign power Epstein was working for.  The info released so far directly states that he was running a blackmail operation.  The next logical question ‚Äì the one we might be permitted to ask ‚Äì is ‚Äúfor who?‚Äù

            The Precious is not a friend of the tribe. One notes that the inclusion of W.J. Clinton in this release could be a shot at Her, since she might like to be a rival to The Precious‚Äô avatar Biden for this year‚Äôs nomination. Extrapolating along these lines, and looking at the schism on the left re: Israel, it is not so far fetched to think that it might be The Precious who wants to expose (in the more ‚Äúrespectable‚Äù media) what Epstein was really doing and for whom. Seeing as how the burgeoning ‚Äúanti semitic‚Äù left is very much his left. Whereas the pro-semitic left is more Her left.I realize that the Biden administration being loaded to the gills with the chosen is a flaw in this hypothesis, however, the absence of the Orange Man from this latest Epstein story indicates that its publication is a salvo in the internecine war on the left which we have been seeing play out very publicly since Oct. 7.

                Smart take. A small quibble, if it‚Äôs even that: the inclusion and highlighting of Billy Jeff also has the benefit of distracting from the greater crime here, which is the facilitation and protection of a foreign intelligence service using American children in a honeypot to bribe American and other Western officials. While it might not ding the Christard Zionists, it would be a bit of an eyeopener for Normie.

                This was my take also. I think it also shows how much control Obama/Soros has over the Judiciary and FBI as Hillary was brought in specifically by the Bidens to shore their Admin up as they have no real political machine and the Clintons do.
I have a longer take on this including my view that ethnic appeals by certain people are being replaced by GLOBAL identity teams, but that is my view.

        do you believe Menendez‚Äôs recent scandals stem from the Qatari (read: Hamas) bribery? I remember Fox Newsreaders in 2002 assuring me about the importance of our new alliance with that fabled land. Not many Q countries in the list, gotta hold onto those.
His Egyptian bribery with the Lebanese-Armenian strip-mall Bond girl was opera buffo enough, but I had thought he was also AIPAC‚Äôs top guy on the Democrat side (with Fetterman now taking his place; clown world).

        Lobbying ‚Äî an extension of common political maneuvering ‚Äî exists to leverage one‚Äôs voice.An argument could be made (not that I would necessarily make it) that in a mass society of votes, monied interests must have a way of joining discussions at the table. Since theyaremonied interests, by definition they can afford to fund themselves.Washington lobbyists work both sides of the aisle. Democrats and Republicans alike are seduced by their promises of filthy lucre. One of the more interesting aspects of lobbying is when they write out the bills for elected officials, which become law with little modification. This is considered a convenience, when really it is the most rampant example of abuse of the political system possible.(To read more of my writings, click on my name with your mouse)

        Don‚Äôt underestimate the Chinese.  I have heard Chinese businessmen can run rings around the Jews.  Sure the Jews have infiltrated all strata of American society, but mass immigration and multi-culturalism have brought the Chinese into our military and universities.  Their monster-big economy has every business mogul eating from their hands.
Worse, while the Jews and Zionists might well be parasites, they don‚Äôt want to kill the host.  China‚Äôs intentions are purely malignant.  The ceasing of America is to be very much desired by the CCP.

            ‚ÄúWhile the Jews and Zionists might well be parasites, they don‚Äôt want to kill the host.‚Äù
And who is funding/promoting/enabling/supporting that mass Asian/African/Middle Eastern immigration? Hint: It‚Äôs not the Chinese.
And considering that the Tribe has spent decades destroying our culture, ruining our money supply, vilifying Christians, separating families, and ruining our cities with forced integration, it seems a tad suspicious when someone points and says, ‚ÄúLook! It‚Äôs the Chinese!‚Äù
And besides, it‚Äôs not the Chinese who are telling American kids it‚Äôs just grand to chop off your privates. If that‚Äôs not killing the host, I don‚Äôt know what is.

                    The Chicoms are a threat because our ‚Äúleadership‚Äù invited them in, handed them the keys, then looked aside as they plundered our tech secrets. Any attempt to point this out was labeled ‚Äúracist‚Äù by the usual suspects. Sorry, but China is on the back-burner and can only be dealt with after the furiously boiling pot on the front has been dealt with. China did not open our borders. China did not ship our jobs abroad. China did not unleash sexual perversions on us. China did not embroil us in horrific conflicts in the Mideast and Ukraine. And China is not responsible for our totally mismanaged Federal Reserve and congressional spending.

            I don‚Äôt know Zulu J. Julian Gewertz has claimed the flowering of Shanghai for the Jews. üòâhttps://newrepublic.com/article/118477/shanghai-one-greatest-jewish-cities-ever-constructedI found this when doing some searches on Jews and the Opium Trade. I did that search because a nice Jewish man I know, who is ethno-centric to an extreme, was bragging about some book that documents these three Jewish brothers that owned the opium trade in China all by themselves. It struck me as odd that something like that would be a source of ethnic pride and counted as a great accomplishment, if it is true.Growing up a full colorblind adherent and having had several Jewish people help me in my life I really hate this mode of thinking. But, when your people are openly targeted for genocide and your homelands opened for mass invasion it becomes impossible not to notice when you start looking for answers.In any case, my takeaway from today‚Äôs column is, aside from the astounding levels of betrayal of our nation, that white people need to adapt or die. We must become a fifth column of our own. We have the numbers, the intellectual and martial capabilities to do so. We must recognize that America is gone, and so we must organize to participate in the ethnically centered plundering of its remains as a fifth column of our own.I need to think about this some more, but that is the thought that has struck me after reading today‚Äôs article. We need to stop whining about what others are doing to us and accept that right now, this isn‚Äôt our place anymore. So, we have to play by the rules of the people whose place it is. Then we can use our organizational, martial and intellectual prowess to put the remnants that we have captured to use for our purposes. That is essentially what the anti-white coalition has been doing to us in quasi-stealth for almost a century.I am not afraid of China or Jews or anyone. I am afraid of us just standing around being afraid to stand up for ourselves or to break rules long broken while everyone else is gorging at the feeding frenzy.Food for thought.

            Zulu Juliet:  Most Americans are ignorant about the Chinese, thinking they‚Äôre merely a quiet, ‚Äòmodel‚Äô minority.  While they generally don‚Äôt seek publicity, they have their own financial and commercial network in AINO and you will never be part of it.  Too many White men think Chinese women are demure and subservient, when they actually exert iron control over their husband‚Äôs salary, and their mercenary nature when considering a mate puts even White gold diggers to shame. (If you want demure and subservient, marry a Thai.)Personally, I‚Äôd rather not have any of them in America.  They have filthy public habits ‚Äì spitting, littering ‚Äì and care only about what‚Äôs behind their front door, with no concern for public spaces.  They haggle over everything (do NOT get in a checkout line behind one).  Once they‚Äôve taken over a school district, there will be no more sports or band, but orchestra (with cutthroat competition).  Other language classes will be dropped in favor of Chinese.  There will be no mothers volunteering to organize class parties or going on field trips.  Your children will not be invited to their homes.Like the Jews, their primary loyalty is to their people ‚Äì i.e. other Han.  Yes, some of them became rabid anti-communists, but that is not in any analagous to pro-heritage America.  The numerous mixed Jewish-Chinese marriages attest to their similar natures and values.  Who is using whom is open to question.  But neither group is ‚Äògood‚Äô for Whites.Where I disagree with you is when you label their intentions as ‚Äòmalignant.‚Äô  They don‚Äôt hate us, but they do consider us an unnecessary roadblock on their way to what they consider their ‚Äòrightful place‚Äô in the world hierarchy.  They don‚Äôt need to invade us militarily when there are already millions of them here, with complete and unrestricted entre to our military, government institutions, scientific and research establishments, etc.  All they need to do is wait a bit while ‚Äòour‚Äô government accelerates our decline fall.

            Your comment pretty much confirms Z‚Äôs thesis.

So the idea America should go after China is hardly original. Could a fifth columnist have slipped into the comment section?Unfortunately, you‚Äôre about half a century too late. That‚Äôs how long America‚Äôs been building up China as a bulwark against the Soviet Union. We even sacrificed much of our industry (though more, I regret to say, out of economic than geopolitical considerations). The Soviet Union is no more, but China now has more manufacturing capacity than the collective West combined. So we should have sided with Taiwan all along?The assertion that China and the Chinese are some kind of existential threat to America beggars belief. Overseas Chinese are often among the most anti-CCP (Chinese Communist Party) people you‚Äôre likely to meet. You‚Äôll find students in just about any classroom in China who think America is the greatest place ever, rather naively in my opinion, and much to the consternation of the school‚Äôs party secretary.Indeed, every work unit in China has its party secretary. Chinese probably got the idea from from the Soviets, who had commissars. These political hacks are not placed over more competent managers of a school, a factory or anything else for efficiency sake; but for their undying loyalty to the party. Since commissars were typically Jewish, one might speculate that the position developed from Jewish behavior in the diaspora.

                I did not say the Jews were not a threat.  I said that the Chinese have a malign influence on our nation as well as the Jews.  One is a parasite the other a clever opportunist with no regard at all for the civic well being of ANY American institution.  Jews have built hospitals, museums, colleges and industries in America.  The Chinese would rather all that were dust.  Not that they actively work to that end, but they just don‚Äôt give a fig about one tittle of American culture, heritage or people.

Unfortunately, he was operating with the complete blessing of the US intelligence apparatus, which indicates that our intelligence apparatus is either owned by a foreign intelligence state, or has no interest in what is good for the nation it is supposed to serve.

            Whitney Webb covered this years ago and her reporting is must read if you really want to go down that rabbit hole. Epstein had compromising video evidence on hundreds of powerful politicians, academics, businessmen, and celebrities; all with the goal of gaining control over their public actions and by extension, influence over their fans and followers. The basic deal was . . . yes, we now own you, but we will make you rich in return for your subservience. Some of the biggest current names in ConInc are members of this club.

        Fascinating. I had never heard of the ‚ÄúApollo incident.‚Äù Thanks for mentioning it.When you add it all up ‚Äî the Rosenbergs, the Apollo incident, The USS Liberty, Pollard, Epstein, etc. ‚Äî it is definitely rather queer. There is absolutely a Fifth Column and they always get a pass on this stuff. You are trained to ignore the obvious.But it‚Äôs part of their religion and culture to do this. When I was a kid I used to read the story of Joseph in the Bible. Dolly Parton sang about it. We did ‚ÄúJoseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat‚Äù as a high school play. But I had no idea what the fuck it meant. What kind of ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù would sell their sibling into slavery and then lie about it to their father?But the moral of the story was that after Joseph infiltrated the government of Egypt, during the famine he ripped off the Egyptian grain and gave it to the very brothers who had sold him into slavery. ‚ÄúJuden √ºber alles‚Äù is the lesson.

        I don‚Äôt recall hearing of Glenn Dubin before yesterday, but now I‚Äôm wondering who he pissed off.If you wonder why none of our elected representatives ever pull on the FBI‚Äôs leash, remember that it was the FBI who went to Epstein Island and Epstein‚Äôs Manhattan house and took possession of everything there.That stuff has a shelf life, eventually everyone so incriminated will get old and die, so a new Epstein is no doubt already in operation. Assuming he was ever the only one, which he almost certainly wasn‚Äôt.Of course when it comes to female pols, for the younger generations such elaborate kompromat is scarcely needed, since nowadays they all have taken (at least) nude photos of themselves, and we have already seen this sink the political careers of several up and coming females.

        I remember when a well decorated US Navy pilot got caught in a bribery scheme after leaving the military and becoming a public servant.No one goes into public service out of good will towards their community. Sad really.It‚Äôs why we no longer point at historical politicians as role models for our children. Today it‚Äôs football players and musicians because we know their morals are already as low as they can go.Randall Harold ‚ÄúDuke‚Äù Cunningham, Commander, US NavyHe was awarded the Silver Star, Purple Heart, Air MedalSAN DIEGO, 3 March 2006  ‚Äì After acknowledging that he had ‚Äúmade a very wrong turn,‚Äù former Representative Randy Cunningham was sentenced in federal court here on Friday to eight years and four months in prison for taking $2.4 million in bribes from military contractors in return for smoothing the way for government contracts.Judge Burns said Mr. Cunningham, an eight-term Republican from Rancho Santa Fe who represented the northern suburbs of San Diego, could have retired to business long ago if he wanted to make copious money but instead engaged in bid rigging and badgering officials and other witnesses to help cover his tracks.

                McCain and AZ voters illustrate just how stupidly in love the average voter is with an ex military man entering politics.  McCain was an opportunist who screwed every AZ constituent for years.  We bent over for him and asked for more.  He ran AZ politics for at least his last decade with an iron fist.  In the end, he would not even meet with his (angry) voter base and yet, but always won reelection.

        First, telling hard truth bluntly is one of the reasons why this blog is so popular among the realists. As unique as that is, others are also starting to speak up; namely Scott Ritter, Douglas Macgregor, and Larry Johnson are now openly announcing that AIPAC owns the US Congress lock, stock, and barrel.These purchased representatives can easily hide their duplicity as long as they bring home the bacon for their constituents with a few token public works projects. But what happens when the gravy train runs out of gravy? Chances are that they can weather a slow slide to the bottom (controlled demolition), but what happens if the next Jan 6th turns into the storming of the Bastille. A lot of pent up anger is going to get released in a big hurry.Can it happen here? The models say . . . yes it can!

            I have written before of an ‚Äúepistemological breakthrough‚Äù, where we can finally call things out for what they are. We are not there yet, but the serial backfires on Ukraine, Gaza, DIE and even Epstein have squandered the presumed moral authority of the usual suspects. Outside of the United States, and even within it for nonwhites and those under 40, Zionists and their neocon and neoliberal cousins are universally reviled. Even the eurocucks resent them, although they know who holds the whip.All it would take now is for one major media or political figure who is not insane (sorry, Ye) to call out collective Jewish interests as such, and it would become a legitimate, or at least unavoidable, subject for debate. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a pogrom, just evaluate tribal interests with the same scrutiny that every other parochial ethnic group gets.My money is on Tucker Carlson, maybe Vivek. Musk may free ride, but he won‚Äôt be the first out of the gate. Trump, as usual, will almost certainly disappoint, although he may be good for a zinger or two.

                I agree with you Tarol Cabot. What is the parable of the Little Dutch Boy and the holes in the Dyke?In some sense Tucker has already done this, at least twice that I can see in a major way. He did it with Candace Owens and he did it again on a major interview with some Subcon. In the latter case, it had to have been pre-pared because the Subcon interviewer explicitly called out Shapiro in the context of primary loyalty and Tucker elaborated.The thing that is nice about Tucker is his posture. He isn‚Äôt questioning and hiding and retracting. He just comes right out and says it and frames it all with a succinctly presented logical argumentation.The big thing on the table now that is hanging over the plate for someone like Tucker is Saul Ignatiev, Donald Moss and numerous black supremacists promoting white genocide with tenure and full sanction at Harvard for decades.A full scale exposee of who has funded Harvard over those decades, who oversaw Harvard during those decades, and why this isn‚Äôt mentioned, renounced and rectified is right there waiting to be done.There is also a series of follow ons to be done. Now that Penn and Harvard have forced out a Gentile white woman and a black woman, and replaced them with Jews, what is happening with regards to anti-white teachings and activities on those campuses?What would be amazing is if Matt Walsh did it. The thing is, he could become his own boss if he did that. The moral high ground is waiting to be seized and a massive and forever loyal audience is waiting to be had to whoever does this. Someone with a big and existing platform who sits at the table has it within their power to sieze the full moral authority and flip the table over in one blow.All of the ingredients are there. Genocidal talk is unacceptable. Decades and decades of genocidal talk and of decreasing opportunity for whites in a slow bleed dispossession is ready to be exposed to a ass audience.Do any of our people still have the will to go for the throat when our very survival is at stake? I think you are right and that we are going to find out sooner than we think.

                AKA The Rectification of Names. Confucius was big on the need to call a spade a spade in order for the State to be well-governed. To call a Spade a Spade in current year, let alone to name the (((Kindly Ones‚Ñ¢))) will bring down the Furies upon one‚Äôs head.Many on the DR have written variations on the need to go back and read pre-WWII material. It was all much more well-understood and matter-of-fact accepted back in the day.I always like to harp on the song ‚ÄúYou Have to be Carefully Taught‚Äù from South Pacific. The heavy-handed message of this song is that one has to *learn* racial noticing / ‚Äòprejudice‚Äô. Which is kind of rich given that the song itself is the thing doing the indoctrination that one should ignore one‚Äôs evolved instincts and stray from the interests of one‚Äôs own tribe.We‚Äôve been so very Carefully Taught, and bullshitted, and gaslighted, and cattle-prodded in our Skinner Boxes. No surprise it‚Äôs so hard for Normie to break conditioning.

            Shapiro is an ardent Zionist and Tribe Member (but I repeat myself). As such, he doesn‚Äôt need to be bribed or blackmailed to embrace the primary mission of subverting the host society.

Every time the son drank, he badmouthed his father ‚Äì clearly had a great deal of anger. One of the things he would say is that his father was, to wit, lascivious. I did not press details, but over a period of weeks, he voiced this (and many other complaints) about his father repeatedly. I believed at least some of the son‚Äôs complaints, and I would not be surprised if he did hang out with Epstein.

        In the case of Israel there is another ‚ÄúFifth Column,‚Äù or is it a Sixth Column or perhaps useful idiots or fellow travellers.  These are Christian heretics who believe that Jews remain the chosen people and that the present day state of Israel is a continuation of the Biblical kingdom of David, Solomon, etc.  According to this heresy it is God‚Äôs will that the United States defend and support Israel as part of an eschatological destiny.  I was raised in this heresy and it took me years to get free of it.  I think the traditional Christian view was that the Jews rejection of Jesus as the Messiah broke God‚Äôs covenant with the Jews and that breaking was symbolized by the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem in 70 AD by the Romans.How does one fight a heresy?  Where‚Äôs the Inquisition when you need it?

            I‚Äôve always suspected that this is part of the reason that the GOP grew to be such slavish defenders of Israel.  I know that there are money laundering aspects in the aid given to Israel and a lot of that comes back to D.C. politicians as kickbacks, so I‚Äôm sure the GOP is a beneficiary of that in part and they want the grift to continue.  At the same time, I think a lot of heretics of whom you speak were a big part of the Moral Majority back in the day when it was highly influential and able to raise money and turn out voters for the GOP.  The GOP latched onto the Israel thing because they realized the Moral Majority types would eat it up and continue with the help while the GOP could just get on with ignoring all their other concerns.

                The Israelis buying Jerry Falwell a private jet may also have had something to do with it.
The Israel lobby eventually realized that millenarian evangelicals could be used to their advantage, whereas previously they ostracized them as weirdos. Arguably it was their greatest political success, as it made support for Israel bipartisan.

            That‚Äôs one reason to doubt that Epstein really ran a Mossad honeypot (though it does *seem* obvious that he did).Republicans don‚Äôt even need to be reminded, let alone paid, let alone extorted, to do Israel‚Äôs bidding. American Christianity is the worship of Jews‚Äînot Biblical Jews, but the ones on TV. And the Democrats are the Jews on TV.Importing too many Muslims and cultivating antiwhite mass hysteria while being exemplary white people is giving them some trouble, but not much. ‚ÄúPro-Palestine protestors‚Äù don‚Äôt matter. If they did, they‚Äôd be shot. Outright ‚Äúnaming‚Äù can have a cumulative effect when it‚Äôs true, so Republicans are passing laws against it.Among our rulers, people who decide *anything*, who‚Äôs against them? Nobody. Only Elon has been publicly threatened and it wasn‚Äôt with sexual blackmail. They showed him a cradle with a bullet in it. Those who know Elon lore know he‚Äôs highly vulnerable to sexual blackmail‚Äîif anybody is.But in fact nobody is. I mean, you and I are, but nobody who matters is. Being exposed as an Epstein client/associate/etc. has ruined nobody. You could name a hundred of them and YOU DON‚ÄôT CARE. Nobody does. Not even their wives and daughters‚Äî*especially* not their wives and daughters, judging by the families of rock stars I know.Mossad, in the form of the the ‚ÄúJIDF‚Äù (miscellaneous internet hasbara ops), only brings up Epstein in the context of Trump. Every ‚Äúmeme flag‚Äù (concealed geolocation) post on /pol/ about Epstein is about Trump. Every fellow white person on Twitter posts AI fakes of Trump on the Lolita Express. They have *no use for Epstein* other than TRUMP.And it wouldn‚Äôt effect him at all, even if it were all true. The one thing America‚Äôs rulers and ruled agree on‚Äîthe one deep meeting of the public and private mind‚Äîis that young shiksas are fair game.

        The inherent logical contradictions of the Zionist project will end in it‚Äôs eventual failure.Plenty of non-Zionists Jews have publicly stated it; former Israeli PM‚Äôs have commented on it as well.  Henry Kissinger didn‚Äôt expect them to last much longer.They‚Äôre a colonizing, theocratic ethnostate of about 7 million, surrounded by 1 billion people who don‚Äôt care for them, with an additional 7 million hostile Palestinian who legally live within their ‚ÄúGreater Israel‚Äù borders.  They can have their ethnostate, or they can have democracy, but they can‚Äôt have both.Between the Epstein honey pot operation run by (probably exactly who it looks like) and AIPAC, and American church-anity spewing ‚ÄúJudeo-Christian‚Äù nonsense, US involvement keeps this thing going forever.  Not to mention ‚ÄúThe Sampson Option‚Äù ‚Äì Israel will nuke everyone in the region if they start going down.I‚Äôve no solutions.

        ‚ÄúIt is the reason that every congressman quickly moves from representative of his people to Washington to Washington‚Äôs representative to the people of his district.‚Äù
This first dawned on me during the Gamestop scandal. Why was my Congressman not protesting over this blatant, government-approved, in-full-daylight market rigging by a handful of interconnected hedge fund billionaires? Staffers let it slip that they were furious, but the Congressman was ‚Äúaware‚Äù (and doing/saying nothing). Just like the slapdown of AOC and the ‚Äúsquad‚Äù over a mild letter suggesting a diplomatic response to the Ukraine war.

        Good column, Zman, with the usual insight and a few chuckles (‚Äú‚Ä¶one in six million coincidence‚Ä¶‚Äù).But I think your conclusion‚Äî‚ÄúWhat this all points to is a defect in democracy‚Ä¶‚Äù‚Äîis a little off the mark. The observation is true enough, and worth stating. But it‚Äôs a little like saying the problem of a vicious criminal is ‚Äúsociety.‚Äù That is, it puts the blame on all of us, instead of on the bad actor.It‚Äôs certainly true that nearly every nation (at least those that can) plays an influence game in Washington. But only a very few of them (I‚Äôd add the Saudis here) play in a way that has enormous consequences for the entire American nation, including provoking it to military action. And how many nations are explicitly known to use ‚Äúentrapment‚Äù and blackmail to exert control over large numbers of political, media, business, cultural, and other ‚Äúelite‚Äù figures? How many are able to corrupt American elites using the very money America lavishes on them?Again, to call this a problem with democracy is hardly wrong; but if so it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a problem of human nature, and every regime is subject to it (I‚Äôm not so sure the king you envision would necessarily be a defense against foreign influence). Crime too is a problem of human nature; it empowers the criminal over the law-abiding. It‚Äôs good to know the defects of the system that enables criminality. But you still need to deal with the criminal himself (or herself).

                Actually, I think the main problem with Israel is unlike a lot of other countries who spend aid dollars on their own populations (whether bread or barbed wire depends on the particular country) Israel channels a lot back into influencing the next round of appropriations. And like the Al Jazeera vids Z linked to said, a part of that is countering the BDS movement on college campuses.Incidentally, while there are a lot of known donors to BDS, including the Rockefeller Foundation and a crapton of foreign countries, most of the funding is nebulous, apparently not even penetrable by Mossad. Or if Mossad does know, is keeping it to themselves, possibly to use in the next round of appropriations lobbying‚Ä¶

        The Tribe‚Ñ¢ have a habit of being the source of periodic ‚Äúeruptions‚Äù among the people they have been feasting upon. In most cases, these events were tied to the abuse of usury and connected political entanglements leading to riots or war. And these events in turn have led to expulsions, which The Tribe‚Ñ¢ have described as being ‚Äúirrational‚Äù, when in fact said expulsions were the result of behavioral patterns. There is a long record of these kinds of eruptions dating back to ancient times, and with commentary about the peculiar behavior of these people leading to this chaos. Every medieval incident was tied to things like usury, slave trading, and bribery. This has been the pattern for 2,000 years and it is the same pattern we see today. Are we about to see yet another ‚Äúeruption‚Äù in our lifetimes. Beware the Samson Option.

            Yeah, but I‚Äôm sure Jews signed off on the Epstein doc dump. Also, especially in this day and age, people can connect the dots. Epstein didn‚Äôt hide his name like Jon Stewart or Robert Maxwell.
At best, this doc dump is meant to signal to like-minded folk in Washington. Whether it‚Äôs for Tucker Carlson reformists (like us) or merely for a petty Democrat faction remains to be seen.

        There is an important distinction to be made here. Israel buys people and they stay bought. The Chinese and Arabs have been bribing politicians for a long time but the ingrates in Washington keep double-crossing them.The Epstein operation was just a ‚Äúbelt and suspenders‚Äù plan because those ensnared by it couldn‚Äôt be bought because most were already very very rich. Notice how very few politicians were on this ‚Äúlist‚Äù. Why? Mainly because politicians usually have enough free time and ‚Äúgame‚Äù to get laid on their own. Business people are usually ugly dudes who aren‚Äôt good with women and are too busy to cultivate mistresses ‚Äì they are most susceptible to honey pots. Bill Clinton of course is just a horndog in his own category.

Not just bought, blackmailed. A photo of Senator Conservitard diddling a kid can be a powerful incentive to do whatever the Tribe wants. The bribe money just makes the sh*t-sandwich easier to swallow.
And as far as the politicians, we‚Äôre not seeing many of their names because the best stuff was held back, including all of those incriminating tapes that were ‚Äúlost‚Äù by the Feds.

            ‚ÄúIsrael buys people and they stay bought. The Chinese and Arabs have been bribing politicians for a long time but the ingrates in Washington keep double-crossing them.‚ÄùFor a reason ‚Äî well, two reasons. First, Israel‚Äôs reps in the USA (whether the Mossad or AIPAC or Jewish-American politicians or just the diaspora in general) are part of the US system in a way the Arabs and Chinese cannot be. The Arabs and Chinese belong to entirely different civilisations. Jews, on the other hand, have wormed themselves in to the very fabric of American and European political, social, economic, and cultural life. They are insiders whereas the Arabs and Chinese are outsiders.Second, the Israel Lobby probably has compromising info on US politicians, which I doubt the Arabs and Chinese have. I‚Äôd be amazed if they don‚Äôt have pictures of Lindsey Graham getting humped by other men in sleazy motel rooms. In other words they not only have the carrot of bribes and other freebies, they have the stick of retribution if any politician goes out of line. And of course any principled politician who goes against Israeli interests finds his political competitors suddenly getting funded and his own reputation being besmirched.

                    Indeed.Plus their biggest weapon which has always been to ‚Äòblend‚Äô into the home-crowd, if you catch my drift; well, when they fancy it.It is my understanding that Mossad operates a huge net persons, of various degrees of expertise, seniority and activity. And when I say ‚Äòoperate‚Äô, this could simply be a person, of known good standing (a small business person, perhaps), who ‚Äòwants to help the mother country‚Äô and will be called upon at some time ‚Äì perhaps never.Though I am not too interested in this now, the dealings of this agency since it‚Äôs inception to present, have been, er, clarifying, to say the least.

        Nothing to quibble with. Couldn‚Äôt agree more. Just one comment on the side: Jewish people constitute a big chunk of the intelligentsia in the USA. Consequently it‚Äôs easier for them to mold public opinion than for any other group.

        Btw, Darryl Cooper‚Äôs Martyrmade podcast has a great series on Epstein. His story is even more ridiculous and disgusting than you think. I highly recommend it.Epstein wasn‚Äôt just running a honey pot operation. He was also helping people hide money and/or financing intelligence operations. That‚Äôs one of his connections to Maxwell, who used his enormous business operation to launder money for Mossad.It‚Äôs unbelievable the operation that Mossad via Epstein was (and, presumably, still is) running. You also see how the wealthy Jewish community around the world but particularly in the US and Canada work together and with Mossad and countless organizations and lobbies to buy off, blackmail or threaten anyone and everyone to push Jewish interests.Once you understand how they operate, you realize that the Jews act much more like an international mob organization than a well-funded lobby group. They prefer to buy you off, but if that doesn‚Äôt work, they‚Äôll go much further to get what they want.Finally, Cooper made a good point in a tweet when someone mentioned that Epstein was working for Mossad. He correctly noted that the CIA had to be aware of Epstein was doing, so he was operating with the agency‚Äôs approval and presumably getting something out of it as well.But that‚Äôs leads to the question of whether the Jews really have a fifth column in the US at all. I mean, if they run the show, it‚Äôs not a fifth column. They‚Äôre in charge, so Jewish operations are just the deepest of the deep state.

                Yeah. You can spend the rest of your life understanding the precise nuances of which Jews, exactly, and how, precisely they were involved in this or that specific outrage and whether a third cousin should really count as a relation to this other wrongdoer, who also happens to be Jewish, in this other specific, exact, precise outrage and decide if the really, truly matters.
Or you can just notice things.

            Speaking of the wealthy Jewish community, there‚Äôs an aspect of the Bernie Madoff scandal that doesn‚Äôt get much discussion.  Madoff was running a classic affinity scam in that nearly all his investors were Jewish.  Most of his investors almost certainly knew that the returns he was offering were way too good to be true and that he was engaged in some kind of criminal activity.  What they seem to have been convinced of though is that Madoff was front-running and that‚Äôs how he was getting the abnormally high returns.  They just never quite grokked to the fact that Madoff‚Äôs clear criminality ran as far as running an outright Ponzi.

                A big reason why Madoff got away with it for so long is because most of his Jewish investors just wouldn‚Äôt believe a fellow Jew would rip them off. If he‚Äôd been Anglo, Chinese or Sri Lankan the jig would‚Äôve been up a lot earlier.

                    I‚Äôm not saying it was the case with Madoff, but it‚Äôs generally a truism that different standards of morality apply to one‚Äôs in-group vs. the out-group. Sometimes this is even codified in a people‚Äôs law, such as the Jews‚Äô.  This worked both ways: It might have been ok for The Tribe to cheat a Goy, but on the other hand, Tribe members were expected to obey a long list of Mitzvot while the Gentiles needed obey only a handful, basically what we call the Ten Commandments. Based on my admittedly summary understanding of these things, then yes, Madoff crossed a line if he cheated fellow Tribals.

                    To be fair, the Old Testament is full of stories of these fellows bilking one another, or being disobedient to God. I mean, Moses leaves for a bit and returns and there they are, melting down gold to make an idol.

            Citizen,Hot! Well said in your conclusion there. When I look around and see who gets their way and on whose behalf things are done, it is impossible not to conclude that America is a vassal of Israel.On Binyamin Hoch: ‚ÄòSix serving and former heads of Israeli intelligence services attended Maxwell‚Äôs funeral in Israel, while Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir eulogised him and stated: ‚ÄúHe has done more for Israel than can today be told.‚Äù‚Äò Oh please tell us Yitzhak, please tell us.Today‚Äôs topic and the backstory on G. ‚ÄúMaxwell‚Äù and her father seem like a critical story to get out. It would be great if Tucker picked this up. Getting these sorts of stories out also makes it imperative that he not do the Alex Jones-esque space alien type stories. It hurts his credibility.The takeaway from this is that we need to become our own fifth column. It is a shame that Thiel pays the people he does to be his leading thinkers. Think of where we would be if just one of our guys paid our best and brightest and we combined massive in-group preference with a calculating means to get only the best and most loyal talent.

        Isn‚Äôt the experience of the ancient Greeks that democracy invariably ends soon n oligarchy, ie a racket?I think one always arrives at the conclusion that strict utilitarism amd free market are not enough to perpetuate a meaningful society. Because there is always going to arise situations where the (short-term??) interests of the powerful are in conflict with the long-term interests of society at large. This may be one reason why society without religion is bound to collapse. Religion providing ‚Äúhigher allegiances and rules‚Äù that will resonate when appealed to or shown to have been violated. Without this, you run into a sort of ‚Äúhome alone‚Äù problem where no moral adults are in charge and anything goes

        If it ever comes to pass that America has to throw Israel under the bus, look for them  to cozy up to the Russians. Their main concern is survival, and they will make alliance with whoever helps them do that.  After the establishment of the modern State of Israel in 1948, many left leaning Israelis were in favor of a Soviet alliance

            Lots of weirdness in Israeli politics right now. The Ashkenazi population is in decline, while the Mizrahi are on the rise in terms of numbers and political power. The old guard is committed to the old relationship with Washington, but the new guys are less interested in that and more open to dealing with China and Russia. They are also less interested in deporting the remaining Arabs and creating greater Israel.Interestingly, the Israelis have the same problem as the West. The machine that is their political-economy requires a level of human capital that is in decline. It takes smarts to operate the lobbying system. it takes smarts to run Mossad. The smart fraction in Israel is shrinking, just as we see in the West.
