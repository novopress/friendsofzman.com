        Great topic. One of the things I discovered as a college professor is that most youth are mindlessly conformist. Very few think independently. The entire “youth movement” of the Sixties was not only an anomaly based in Boomer demographics, but the majority of kids involved in it were just following the herd.As an early Gen Xer I have always been frustrated by the cultural hegemony of the Boomers and the youth culture. I got sick of hearing Boomer music like Led Zeppelin and Hendrix by 1980 or so. I never really had an interest in using drugs or sport-fucking as many chicks as I could. It’s bizarre to see fat, gray, longhaired 70-year olds still trying to carry on like that.Stupidly, I thought that getting an education and deferring hedonistic gratification would pay dividends over time. I was wrong.What’s worse, the Boomer ethos is now institutionalized and manifesting itself in dystopian ways among today’s youth. Young women — tattooed, obese, ill-clothed — are often sexually repulsive, not attractive. Deviants like lesbians and transgenders rule the day.As I approach sixty I find myself in a very odd situation. I see lot of people my age with one foot in the grave from decades of poor choices. By contrast I feel and look fit. I actually (Mirabile dictu!) have a normal BMI. However, having never been part of Boomer culture (and thus deriving none of the merits or demerits of it), I am also too old to fit in with the uber-lefty, feminized, gay, brown, fat, tattooed, foreign youth. Not that I want to, anyway.Although I know I will be dead in 20 years I feel like I am just getting started… but I am a man without a country and without a culture.

            In Detroit, I kept being told by people in their late twenties and early thirties that I do not look my age. At first I thought it was just what they thought was a compliment, but then someone pressed home the point to me and wanted to know how I do not look like a geezer. This person was in the mid-30’s. I did not have a good answer. Never had to think of an answer, but on the way home I thought about functional fitness. I care about being able to do things, so I focus on fitness for doing things like splitting wood or walking a city.

                Staying off drugs, not eating yourself into morbid obesity, not getting STDs and not stressing yourself out at work just so you can buy more Chinese-manufactured shit just like the Joneses has a lot to do with it.I smoked in my 20s, I wanted to quit before I was 30. So I did. I drank too much in my early 20s so I quit for ten years. When I was more mature I limited myself to two beers.I did some running, but mostly you just need to stay active and not park yourself in front to the Talmudvision every night stuffing your face for hours on end.I hit a deer on my motorcycle last September and broke a collarbone, three robs, and collapsed a lung. Out of the hospital in 48 hours and still managed to kill and butcher five of the bastards two months later in November. Not bad for 59, if I don’t say so myself.I should probably do some moderate lifting, you really do start to lose upper body strength as you age.

                    Good post. Really leaves little room for more posts or elaboration. Having come from an academic background as well, I might add a bit of conciliatory comment for those “old geezers” out there who are broken-down, sick wrecks.In my youth and now in old age, there are any number of such people (old, sick wrecks) I’ve known. Manual labor, as vs White Collar, is a killer in many occupations. We as a country treat/abuse our workforce and when they “break down” discard them. I sympathize when I meet such people.Much of this opinion is also generated by some of the foreign faculty and students I’ve come across during my career. Discussions of labor law and occupational safety in some other countries are eye openers. Perhaps that’s because these countries must pay pensions and provide health care, so their incentives are different. Nonetheless, I’ve been impressed with the protections they provide their workforce which seem designed to maintain better health into old age.

                        I think that’s true. Blue-collar laborers are treated like shit and the job does take a toll on their bodies.At the same time most of them have absorbed the Sixties hedonistic ethos and smoke dope, smoke cigarettes, drink too much, eat crap, and have to work overtime to pay for the bastards they have spawned by fucking skanks in the trailer park.In other words, they’re Aristotle’s “slaves by nature.”Sure… roofing is hard on the body, but when you see the roofers at a gas station at 11:00 buying a case of beer, a carton of cigarettes and a slice of pizza for lunch, and you know they have a bag of weed in the truck… they’re not going to be healthy when they’re fifty.I worked with some buttoned-down, old-school professional contractors/craftsmen when I was in grad school. They did not drink or smoke, were not fat and they retired in good health.

                            Hard drinking and blue-collar labor go together like baked potatoes and sour cream. It was ever thus, and thus it shall ever be.I remember once a construction worker buddy and I (we both worked for the same firm) were asked by our boss to be the bouncers at one of our clients’ events: kind of a “thank you” to their subbies. We weren’t drinking, but the caterers running the event kept having to rush out and buy more alcohol from the nearest supermarket as they were constantly being drunk dry. I was like “the attendees are all builders, how could they not have foreseen this?”

                                And this is one of the huge reasons I despise when you people think the answer is to push young white kids into the trades. Not only do you consign your kid to a trailer park lifestyle, but we also don’t have a seat at the table when they decide we have to drive wind-up cars and eat bugs.

                                    It depends what you mean by “trades”.  I am working with Tool &amp; Die makers who own nice houses, camps, airplanes and such.  One has made it into upper management and another is making excellent money as a manufacturing engineer.  Many have retired in comfort and health.
Anyone who learns HVAC, Electricity or Precision Machining will be set for life and never have to worry about getting a job or telling man to F.O., because there will always be another job waiting.

                                        Yep. The devil is in the details. My dad was a unionized tool and die maker for one of the Big Three. He had a good life and his body was not beat up.On the other hand if you are working for an independent non-union roofer, paver, concrete contractor, framer, mason, auto repair shop, or trucking company and all they do is slam out job after job after job as fast as they can doing 12-hour days, you will be wrecked at 45 or 50.Some trade jobs provide an good wage and a good life. Others just grind you down and throw you out when you’re used up.

                                        I did 42 years of hvac and I told my kids to get professional jobs cause its a hard life. Its hard to get cardio or strength exercise when you work out in the extreme heat and cold all the time. You have to make a real effort to at least eat well and get rest when you can. I made it, but by the end I was just physically burnt out. Kids are teacher, actuary and architect and they’re doing quite well early in their careers.

                                            My dad was a union carpenter. I guess his title was “floor mechanic”, I.e. installer of wood and computer floors. He used to drag my brother and me to jobs with him. The object was so that we could see what he does so we wouldn’t end up doing what he does. There is nothing romantic about being Joe Lunchbucket. I won’t say what I do, but my brother’s a doctor. In other words, his scheming worked out pretty well.

And, not that I’d share with you, but I’m pretty confident you don’t make what I make. You may have a better house, but that’s because I’m cheap and don’t want to pay the kind of property taxes other people pay.
Jewish mothers don’t push their kids to be welders and I give them credit for that.

                    I suggest doing pushups. I routinely do a round of 165–one set of 100, a second set of 65–and this certainly helps to keep the upper body tone and strong. Doesn’t elminiate the middle-age spread, however. Not a whole lot one can do about that outside of an extremely austere diet.

                    Good post.Im 61, my dad is 85. He refurbished a kitchen last year, including installing all new cabinets by himself. (He fabricated a mobile lift for just such tasks.)At the end, he could barely lift his arms. The thing is, he thinks, and I agree, that if he stops moving, he’s finished. He’s just wearing out.He smoked 3 packs of Camels (no filter), from his 20’s to the age of 30. Had a widowmaker in his 60’s. Dr said he should have died.I think the reality is that genetics is the main factor in longevity, and thriving till the end.There’s something to be said about being from Eastern European stock.

                Physical fitness, as well as avoiding stupid behaviors such as drug addiction, alcoholism and wanton gluttony, are certainly essential to aging well. However, one cannot ignore genetics. I come from a line of people–especially on the maternal side–who almost all look much younger than they are. Fortunately, I’ve inherited that trait, even to the point of occasionally getting carded at the age of 56.

            I’m the same age and have found the same things to be true. I used to meet a lot of people my age or near it on a daily basis. I always wondered how nearly all of them were so much “older” than me, while being the same age. It’s not like I’ve always lived a healthy life (quite the opposite), but I’ve always managed to stay quite active. I never had to work at staying fit, it just happened.

            Great comment. The real rebels in the 60s were the ones who died young. What the boomer generation did was to turn “rebellion” into a marketing brand. Just grow your hair long, get some tats and listen to Pink Floyd (ooh, edgy!) and you were giving it good and hard to The Man. This trend has continued to this day. Nearly everyone I know around me who looks like a rebel and has all the right appendages caved to the Covid mess. The people who stood up to it and refused the death shot were usually very ordinary workaday people.

            This is a great insight and Zman insightful post hits this overlooked pop culture issue.  I am early Gen X- yes, the Boomers had a significant impact on the culture- particularly with the health and aging; It is ironic they hated parents and invented nursing home/assisted living culture. The now are in horror of that reality. My mom is 95 and has dementia- I gave up all to be home and care for her. i can tell you if time would allow the number of times Boomers have told me to put her in a facility, or get in home care. I am in good health and can care for her- i have older siblings who are too busy looking 20 and going to meetings to worry about what could be immediate future life for them.

I can understand why people want to hold on on their youth.  I’m more shocked at the fat soft youngsters I see.  Why be so fat in your 20s that you walk around like an old man?  You’ll be there soon enough.

            I think weight training is one thing you can do until you die. You have to adjust with age and health, but strength training is the one thing you can do into old age and get rewards from it. Things like swimming, hiking, walking are also lifetime habits. Stretching is another great thing to make a habbit.

                        Yep, and for some particular deficiencies in posture and such, appropriate strength building in weak areas.Here’s another story (you knew this was coming…).  Somewhere along the line a few years back, I tore my right knee meniscus doing some heavy yard work on new house.  The pain was the worse I’ve ever had—it dropped me like a stone and I simply screamed until the pain subsided enough to crawl to front door.  After a week or rest and hobbling around, I recovered (?)—not really, Next year on the roof, same thing, and this time I could not even get down the ladder.  My thought after pain lessened was how embarrassing to die of heat stroke because I was too cheap to hire a roofer.Anyway, this time I went to doctor who tried to sell me on the wonders of orthopedic surgery.  A secondary consultation with “Dr Google” indicated the fruitlessness of such surgery to remove the meniscus and indicated an alternative stretching exercise to perform.  Viola, not a single incident in years, but I stretch every morning to loosen up knees.  I can sit—and do—like a damn Japanese Samurai at a tea ceremony.  😉

                    Yes. A stupid observation, maybe, but Ireland and Russia have had cultivated grains a long time and it didn’t seem to limit alcoholism rates there. It certainly is true of Indians and others.

                        There is a lot of culture effect I admit, but I’ll still bet that the incidence of what we’d call “alcoholism” and premature death  is/was higher in these naive societies.  But that’s only from some authors I’ve read, not actual study or experience.  It also makes sense from a view of strict, and harsh, Darwinian evolution.  Those not able to “hold the liquor”, don’t make it to the next round.

                Tattoos I really don’t get. Self expression sure, but man tats usually don’t age well, especially on women. Really only they can be justified if you go through some personal hell or hellacious accomplishment, like you graduate Ranger or SEAL school or win the Tour de France. Otherwise they’re just dumb.

                    Tattoos on chicks, especially pretty ones, are levelling agents. Because we’re all supposed to be equal, beautiful girls, particularly white ones, disfigure themselves in order to sink to the mean. Few of them are even conscious of why they’re doing it, which speaks to the power of the propaganda firehose.

                        Slut signalling. Women need a way to advertise to the Chads and thugs that they’re easy. Before the tat craze it mean low cut outfits, tight miniskirts, etc… The problem is that a woman needs to be at least passably attractive to make this work. Even an ugly girl can get all tatted up and every Chad knows he can bang her for the price of a drink. It’s another case of democracy’s race to the bottom in everything. This is also why the number of tats a woman has is inversely proportional to her attractiveness.Tats also tell the Chads that the woman makes a lot of hasty, life altering, ill-considered decisions. This means she’s more likely to go for that last-call-for-alcohol 1 am bang too.

                    Tattoos are to the body – male or female, but especially female – what spray paint is to public monuments. A pretty girl can only be damaged by ink and piercings; an ugly girl can of course “own the ugly” and render herself repulsive, as a protest against nature, which draws my sympathyup to a point. One assumes that all girls with normal hormones want to be sorta kinda pretty. When that is denied to them – pitilessly, by the natural course of things – then, yeah, I understand the anger, the self-loathing, the desire to lash out against reality and turn oneself into a pastiche of ugliness and self-hatred.Again,up to a point. To make self-loathing the capstone of your identity means you have no identity at all, really; certainly not as someone other than a human toothache. “I hate myself; Respect me!” is hardly a clarion call to human love and understanding. Passive-aggressiveness in these situations is all but totally the aggressive part.*But let’s get back to the pretty wimminz (h/t Rory Gallagher). Wtf? What Andromeda Strain of counter-intuitive self-mutilation has been unleashed, that makes them dye their hair, do the African nose-ring and lip piercing barbarity, ruin their skin with tattoos, and apply makeup to look like ghouls? Is it possible (here I try to reach back to Zmans motivating essay) that the health obsessions of mom and dad (or the “prevailing consensus” seen on TV and heard 24/7 on all media) is so annoying that they want to simply reject it and “own the ugly” not of their bodies but of their souls?*Recommended reading. Flannery O’Connor’s short story “Good Country People”. A proto-SJW self-identifyingugly womanfinds out the true meaning of nihilism.

                        Great post. I will say this, however. “Owning the ugly” is pathetic behavior, not just because it is bad citizenship–such people inflict aesthetic/psychic pain wherever they go–but because it is needless capitulation. Hence, while it’s true we can’t all look like Cary Grant or Angie Dickinson, we can make the most of what we’ve got, even if it’s not a lot. And I would contend that even homely people can, through dint of time, effort and modest monetary expenditure, make themselves at least presentable. I really admire a girl who, although not endowed with natural beauty, does her dead level best to look attractive. And in the end, she almost always manages to succeed to some degree. That is infinitely more commendable than turning one’s self into a walking eyesore via purposive disfiguration and mutilation.

                            I consider it a “look at me thing” for the most part.  However, as I look at you, it’s sort of a “tell”.  To me it implies a narcissistic trait, coupled with insecurity, that I’d rather not deal with.  You might be a good lay, but not wife/mother material.  No real experience here as the woman who I chased—until she caught me—was naturally beautiful and needed no adornments. She chose me and that was enough for this ugly guy.

                        I think most aren’t “owning the ugly,” I feel that they truly believe the ink and other disfigurements make them attractive, thus making it unnecessary to put down the fork or hit the gym.

        Enlightening post. Some of the activities encouraged for “peak fitness” in youth turn out to take their toll later in life — too much pounding the pavement now in distance running and you’ll likely have back and knee problems a couple of decades later. Somehow everything has to be competitive and focused on the here and now — no real conception of the passage of time. Activities like walking an hour a day and the basic yoga poses tend not to get emphasised enough.

            Very true about running. I used to be a decent runner and a pretty comfortable 10-miler. Until the day came that when a ran five miles, my lower back would hurt for two days. I guess all those years doing ski patrol for a living killed my back. So now I ride bikes, hike and paddle for cardio exercise. I does help that I live in a place where those activities (along with winter stuff) are wonderful.

                Riding a bike, swimming, the elliptic machine — all these give cardio without the wear and tear on joints that running does. Have to admit, though, that nothing quite gives the “high” that running does.

            I hurt my back with barbell training (sciatica). I am currently doing an old program from the 80’s called heavy hands. Walking and doing exercises with light hand weight. It probably died out because it does look goofy doing it in public. I do it by marching in place 30 minutes a day in my basement. I read in a forum that some guy said that he uses a cinder block to do step ups. Combined with some extra body weight exercises, I feel like I am maintaining good muscle tone and my cardiovascular health has improved. Also, my back pain has gone. I tell my wife that the mirror doesn’t lie and that I have the appearance of a man in his mid twenties and a body with the form and function of an elite Olympic decathlete but she seems dubious.The 1980s Walking Workout That Will Actually Get You in Shape | The Art of Manliness

        I know some old-time ranchers in their 80s who look old (sun weathered skin) and act old (cantankerous) but can still throw a hay bale. Their super power is robustness and humility. They lead simple lives of internal peace and measure success in hard labor. They see the sunrise almost every day. God has blessed them with a life built around daily physicality that is a natural component of survival. They appreciate the taste of every meal they eat because it was hard earned. To them, a beautiful woman wears no makeup whatsoever. The only way that all of this can be reborn is through a collapse-driven return of real hardship. There lies salvation.

                Yes, I value community and my people as much as you do. And that is essential to surviving the interregnum of chaos that will accompany the collapse. Where I live, enough cattle are raised to feed the whole valley if need be, but game hunting is also plentiful. We have enough arable land to grow a variety of crops, which can include grains and vegetables when the supply chain breaks down. Our water aquifer is huge and easily replenished with mountain runoff. No treatment required. We can generate electricity with wind turbines if push comes to shove. Finally, there are only a handful of main access roads into the valley and all can be easily blocked with a little dynamite or small force of arms. And there are a lot of retired military in these parts.

        Nice thoughtful post.  I’m on the downhill side of life, but I try to walk a few miles a day, either on the links or in the hilly hood.  Even with that you can feel the old strength and agility slipping away.  Oh well, it is what it is.  One of the things I hate going about going to the doctor (and I won’t unless I absolutely have to) is all the decrepit old goats shuffling around the lobby waiting for the next verdict or pill to perhaps keep them going a while longer.  Seems no one moves on with any dignity anymore – I hope I don’t do the same when the end is nearer..The boomers I get laugh at are the old bikers riding around on their tricked out Harleys like they were 25 – a ponytail with what’s left of their hair, club jacket, steel toe boots etc.The US has excelled in the here and now culture – what was the old saying – live fast today for you may be dead tomorrow – or something like that.  We’ve exported a lot of crap around the world, that’s for sure.  In Spain, one of the interesting thing I noticed is there’s a LOT more interaction among generations than you see here.  You may see three or four generations together just out for a walk or coffee.  Youngsters walking their grandparents, grandparents walking their grandchildren etc.  Stuff you don’t see much of around here – everyone is off doing their own thing – kinda sad.

            Your observations made of Spain (Madrid is one of the most pleasant andsafestcities I have been to) seems to be generally true of all the countries in that general region. Most certainly Greece and Italy although, as custom (or EU) dictates, Leftist cancer is moving in.It is my view that, seeing as mortal life is just a stage of existence, statements like “live fast today for you may be dead tomorrow” are some of the worse things to happen to humanity. I mean, an individual does their fast living, with no time for reflection and repentance, and then meets his judgement.Preparing for the life after ought to be the core mission of many approaching their physical end. Yet they obsess over acting young. I’m relatively young compared to many here, but I’ve had a very close brush with death from a potentially terminal disease. I cannot overstate the comfort I felt in knowing I’d made an effort to be judged well. Don’t think Christ gives two hoots about my personal best in the swimming pool.Even if I’m not.

            Great post. Summarized all my thoughts, especially the creepy old bikers.Moved to Central America 10 years ago, it is much like you noticed in Spain,very nice to see. Reminds me of when I was a kid 3 score and 10 years ago.Speaking of walking…get a big dog and you will be out walking come rain or shinecold or heat.

            I envy a lot about the Spanish lifestyle. However, the united generations bit isn’t always rosy. It’s often due to unemployment, which means that the young can’t leave home till their mid thirties.

        One thing you can’t blame on us boomers is the “low calorie” diet pushed on us starting about 1970 and lasting till about 2010. It’s a concentration camp diet that only makes you fatter because of all the carbs — and you can’t stay on it. It was promoted by a guy named Ancel Keyes at Harvard, the NY Times and other media and almost the whole medical establishment. As Gary Taubes detailed in his books, most recently “Rethinking Diabetes,” Keyes and Harvard were paid off by the sugar industry to “prove” sugar is good for you. No kidding. That’s why calories are listed on the menu at McDonald’s, instead of carbs. That massive five-decade fraud also was a precursor to the COVID medical fraud we just went through. Never trust the medical establishment, the media, or Harvard. If they lie to us about food, they lie about everything.

        From my observation what gets old people is protein intake.  Once they hit the age where their appetite diminishes they don’t even realize that they’re taking in far too little, and are likely going to even be bragging about how they’re losing weight (its just their legs getting thinner while the flab remains).Right now I have a friend who’s my age but suffers from cirrhosis.  Ok no alcohol yet the doctors say nothing about sugar intake despite fructose being metabolized through the liver just like ethanol.  Of course she “doesn’t like meat”, and fails to make the connection between not eating that meat and being 90 lbs, weak as a kitten, and breaking bones from a slight breeze.

        In my youth I wrestled, spending many hours running and lifting weights.  This continued during my six years in the Marine Corps.  After college I worked sixty hours a week to provide for a stay at home wife and three children.  I didn’t exercise in any significant way for twenty five years.  Then came the empty nest, early retirement and being 59 staring down the barrel at sixty.  I had gained 4″ in trouser waist size and my muscles had atrophied significantly.  I looked like I used to be strong but the first hint of sarcopenia was obviously creeping up on me.  The light bulb really lit up brightly and I got off my ass and decided it was now or never.  I got a physical and, to no surprise, discovered that my testosterone was at the low end of “normal “.  I got on TRT and got back in the weight room with a vengeance.  I also walked three to five miles every day.  Within 1 1/2 years I’ve regained the waist size of my youth, and netted a ten pound gain in total body weight that was all muscle. If this sounds like you, it’s not too late to avert frailty in your advanced years.  The first few months suck but now I love hitting the gym and lifting.  I feel far better than I did at fifty and only wish I’d started earlier.  Sarcopenia and frailty are killers both literally and in terms of health spam.  Something like 50% of people over sixty five who break a major bone like the hip die within a year of the break from indirect causes.  Lifting weights is the number one way to prevent falls due to weakness and also the best way to increase bone density and strength.

Yep, walking is one of the foundations. Too many nincompoops think getting into shape is to start jogging or running immediately — and these people have no foundation of steady regular walking. They’re asking for physical injuries by staerting to jog or run immediately.

            “..got on TRT and got back in the weight room with a vengeance.”I was gonna just hit “like”, but in fairness to the group will verbally confirm all the good advice of “BerndV”.  I did the same.  I measure fitness in pants sizes.  Now wear same as in HS.  Stopped running as the knees and joints can’t handle constant pounding, but replaced it with a mountain bike—easier on the ass as well.  Amazing stuff can be done with a bench and set of adjustable dumbbells.Luckily, I am in a semi rural area and walking is great without much traffic.  Doesn’t hurt to own a Rhodesian Ridgeback that cares nothing about 100+ degree heat and is a 5 -10k a day tracking field dog.  i don’t have such time, but 3 miles or so works for both of us.  I walk her off leash and she runs shit down.  Good conversation piece as most people just walk “fluffy” on a leash and keep wondering what all the fuss is about when she tears through the desert.  We amuse each other. 😉

        One of the reasons I enjoy the western film genre, at least from the 40s to the 80s, is that it reveres the wisdom and toughness that come with age and experience, and mocks the silly pretensions of youth. A common trope in this genre is the cocky, arrogant young gun who gets his comeuppance at the hands of elders he belittles, and in the process, matures into a much better man.But those films were made when America was much farther to the right than AINO. Rightwing societies, I believe, respect and honor old age. Leftist societies condemn the aged as impediments to their repulsive utopias who should be quarantined, ignored, and shuffled into the grave as soon as possible.

        At 85 stairs and/or museum walks aren’t, yet, real problems for me. I can still cut, buck and split a couple of cords of firewood before winter though I readily admit it takes a lot longer to do so than when I was younger.
Mid life exercise is fine but I suspect the real secret of a comfortable productive old age is to have picked the right parents and grandparents. 🙂

            What of my health is up to me is well.My blood is the envy of my athlete friends, fertile women still treat me kindly based on my looks, andI have all the outward markers of a man who’ll live to a hundred.
My mother’s genes have other ideas. I feel brutally shitty all the time, there’s nothing I can do to change it, and every morning I wake up surprised to see another day.

        Interesting, Z. Interesting.Certainly here in The Isles I’ve noticed the obsession with fitness from people in the age range 20 to 60. The funny thing is, these folks always seem to have something wrong with them: permanent muscle pain, dodgy tendons or something else. Many men I’ve worked with spend most of their year training for marathons – I’m confident that by the time they’re seventy, they’ll be in a very bad way.I used to swim, climb do ‘the calisthenics’ and, to be honest, I did it to get women. Now, becoming a father and, most importantly, a Christian, makes me want to focus on functional fitness only (the appearance, within reason, is not important). Most of my exercise is playing with my kids or walking. That’s it. I binned the other stuff years ago.Not saying it’s not worth it, but it needs a moderation that today’s “young at heart” seem to not have. They go all out… and I think they’ll pay from their sixties onward.At least, that’s my take.

            The obsession with fitness is the other side of the coin of the tats n fats trend: an obsession with the body and with external appearance. FFS, it’s not hard: just walk a lot and eat and drink (reasonably) well. And avoid all the stupid fad diets like “no carbs” or “no cholesterol”.

        How apropos. I started a dedicated weight lifting regimen about 6 weeks ago.As Z says, I’m not going to get ripped like the guys in the supplements ads. But I am very interested in maintaining as much strength and mobility as possible, and honestly find certain daily tasks / movements easier than they were 6 weeks ago. For example, twisting at the waist to look over my shoulder to check for traffic as I back out of my driveway. The results have already motivated me to continue.I recently moved to what I consider a fairly rural area; the definition of rural varies but I don’t know the location of a Starbucks in my new digs. There are a lot of old rail trails here, perfect for biking or walking.As a young man I worked as a tender on a mason crew. This Tuesday my neighbor was laying block for the foundation of a new shop he is building, and I went over after work to help him. He only needs two courses, and I figured once the corners were laid up it would be a breeze. So I mixed 4 or 5 batches of mud and helped carry the blocks to lay around the perimeter in preparation for laying up. This is a small job that the crew I worked for is n my 20s would have knocked out in 2 hours.Not gonna lie, two hours of that work wiped me out. I couldn’t believe how much HEAVIER blocks are than I recall from my youth. Nothing I can think of has shown me more starkly the difference of 30 years will make. I’m still feeling tired, though the soreness has largely dissipated from my pathetic lats.I’m gonna keep on lifting, though. I refuse to become one of those goobers on the electric carts at Wal-Mart Mart, struggling to wrestle another case of Mountain Dew into their little wire rack.

            A few years ago, I thought I’d do some sprints. So, I got down into my sprinter’s stance at the neighborhood junior high track, bolted out, ran about 10 yards and pulled up lame with a bad hammy. Even though I hadn’t sprinted in decades, I was still shocked by this injury. I mean, hell, as a kid I ran pellmell all over the place without a care in the world. Never occurred to me that sprinting is not forever.

                    Whichever of us runs the slower 40 time, buys. (-;Must say, made myself the helluva fine steak dinner last night. Salted and peppered a NY strip, drizzled it with a bit of good olive oil, grilled it to medium-rare over pecan wood, topped it with a mixture of Danish blue cheese, fresh breadcrumbs, olive oil, garlic and chives, then ran it under the broiler until the cheese began to melt.Served that puppy with some sauteed mushrooms and a decent zinfandel. All in all, a square meal.If there’s ever a DR meetup, I’ll be happy to handle preparations for the steaks, although I’m sure most of us are pretty competent at that particular task.

                            Down here in Texas people are crazy about their ribeyes. Can’t swing a dead cat what that you hit one. But I’ve always preferred the strip. Nothing but pure, tasty beef without all that connective tissue and gristle.

                                    I’ve never sprung for Wagyu or Kobe. Hell, never even had a dry-aged steak, although I aim to try one here directly. Just hard for me to imagine beef costing $60 per pound can really be that much better than beef costing $14 per pound. The whole boutique steak thing just smacks of a PR con-job to me, and I don’t want to get taken.

        If I’d thought about it, I would have assumed that Willie Mays was already dead if I hadn’t heard the other day that he passed. His prime was 60-70 years ago. He was an early Silent. This is a reminder that, for better or for worse, the boomers are going to be with us a for a long time to come. Discussion of their passing from the scene is premature. Regarding media angst over their aging, we haven’t seen anything yet. I anticipate a flood of “memoirs” from octogenerian boomer women about how they made peace with their elderly infirmities and sags. We also haven’t (yet) seen many plastic people over 80, but there are about to be a whole bunch.

        I played competitive rugby into my late twenties and ran tens of full marathons with competitive times to keep up with my wife until ten years ago. I am in my fifties. Now I bike up to 47 miles in the mornings, and swim up to five miles a week whenI can find the time. I backpack/trek and consider Alaska my second and ultimate home.Diet is the ally of exercise and training. I have focused on dietary intake and the natures of foods and food ingredients since I was a high school wrestler. Particularly in the US, it’s clear that diet and wholesomeness of foods is utterly ignored by the majority of us. Willful ignorance, Big Ag, and the food industry are literally killing lots of people. Outwardly fit folks are quietly dying internally. I would claim we are experiencing a hugemanitarian crisis, joke, worthy of addressing at the scale we did with the space program. But diet is a third rail at the national and many local levels and nothing material will be done about it.It does seem TPTB are deliberately engineering our lack of exercise and poor diet as a means of controlling the population. I hope each of you takes care of yourself if only to resist the bastards.

        I never liked weight training until I had a roommate who gave me Starting Strength to read. I recommend it to anybody interested, because it’s about good mechanics and functional strength, rather than getting shredded. With that said, I don’t try to get stronger anymore, because even if your mechanics are good, it’ll wear out your joints. Find that functional strength and stay there imo. (And rest, stretch, massage, crack your joints, drink water, imo.)The end vs. The End. We’re all going to die someday. If you believe the world was created, it makes sense it will end at some point. Nobody knows when, in either case, though. It makes no sense to me to obsess over it, because you just don’t know. There’s an arrogance and selfishness to the obsessing, imo, and a humility to staying fit and prepared, while carrying on as if life and the world will also carry on.

            Weight training has become so popular today, it’s hard to believe.  When I was a Freshman there was a single weight room in the stadium complex for the scholarship athletes.  We, even as students—not athletes, shared.  Today?  Well, when I left separate facilities had been built and were filled with both male and female students with long wait times for some equipment.

        I am nearly sixty years old and have been an athlete my entire life. In my youth and twenties I was a competitive distance runner then, like many distance runners, I morphed into cycling, triathlons, then obstacle races. The accumulated injuries from years of pounding pavement and other activities now prevent me from running, but I am still cycling and in the gym nearly every day. I am stronger and have a better build than most men in their twenties and thirties–still sporting a six pack.The problem with Rippetoe crowd is that they focus on maximizing strength and bulk in the moment, not long-term fitness and strength. Follow his program and you will put on 30-40 pounds of mass, about half of which will be fat. Carrying this mass is hard on your frame as you age.Make a habit of working out at the same time every day. If you have access to a gym, join one. This is especially true if you work from home or otherwise have a solitary job. The gym will become your social outlet–a substitute for happy hour at a bar. My job is sedentary and entirely solitary. After eight or more hours of sitting on my arse I need to move, so I work out after work when the gym is busiest. It is my social outlet and most of my friends/acquaintances are from the gym.Like most athletes, arthritis is setting into my joints from years of stress and strain, especially in my shoulders and in my big toe joints. Pushing heavy weights, as per Rippetoe, is no longer a good option, so reduce the weight and increase the reps per set. I do about 80 percent of my max at 20 reps per set. I superset almost every lift with opposing or unrelated muscle groups so that I am always moving in the gym. No rest between sets. I work out between 75-90 minutes and rotate days between upper body, core/legs, and cardio.Follow a routine like this and you can stay fit and strong well into your sixties.

        I think this analysis leaves out some US regionalism.I am a mid Gen X and live in Coastal California.  Most guys my age here (and me) are in pretty good shape and do various age-appropriate activities ranging from pickleball to golf to hiking/walking.  I don’t see a lot of “old-looking” guys my age, and in fact I would say most 50 year olds look 10 years younger here.  Some of this is the nutty California culture, and usually there is some sort of dietary fad that goes with this like organic this or probiotic that.  Sure there is plastic surgery, but that is actually fairly rare with the men (women are a different matter).I go back to my home state of Texas and OMG I can’t believe how fat everyone is!  Relatives my age are a good 20-30 pounds heavier than they should be and look in their 60s instead of their 50s.  I think a lot of this is not being able to be doing outside activities during the summers, then that habit carries over to the months they can be outside.  Last time I was in a chain Mexican joint in Texas it seemed to me that all the men there had just given up they all looked so bad, even all the younger men there with kids, putting them in their 30s.

Men just blob out after high school and spend their unhealthy adult years reminiscing in front of the TV about that touchdown they scored in the varsity game, while stuffing their faces with fast food. Even guys in their 20s with manboobs and pot bellies. Health &amp; fitness/body beautiful culture is one of the good SoCal exports.

        I used to jog and then do moderate weights in middle age, no smoking and moderate alcohol.In younger years i always kept in shape.I gave up jogging now in my 60’s its fast walking and moderate weights.I am in my 60’s but can still out work much younger men doing physical activity.The key is getting in shape and being consistent with routine exercise to maintain that shape.Nothing extreme as you get older, just maintenance.Good essay.

        the target audience fears old age more than deathTrue and good stuff, but isn’t all this just a second order effect of fleeting and unprecedented affluence? Other cultures seem to celebrate old age more, and one likely reason is prolonged life is or until recently was not a given. As life expectancy declines in the West in general and the United States in particular, I would expect reverence for old age to return. Supply, demand, that sort of thing. Obviously some very affluent and ancient cultures such as Japan revere the elderly, but in the West, at least, wealth seems to have elevated youth above all.As an aside, the WEF fossils and their aged political help and hos celebrate youth and seek immortality, but they are doomed to failure because one is fleeting and the other impossible. This always has been the case with the Ruling Class; Ponce de Leon’s patrons were the Klaus Swabs of his day, and the conquistadors and Crusaders the sportsballers who the then-Normies celebrated and fantasized to be. People outside of the West are poised to force its return to reality just as Elizabeth forced Madrid in her day.

        This is one of the things wrong with the culture that rarely gets any attention.  Putting so much emphasis on the youth is a way of pushing through the changes they want.  They are the easiest to fool and just spent most of their lives being propagandized in educational institutions.

            A population that can be convinced to have colonostopies every three years can be convinced of anything.
Say NO to colonostopies.  The Hershey Highway is built as a one-way street.  All strength to Colo-gard.
Why suffer the indignities, when you can poop in a box and have someone else root through it?
I’ve tried to talk sense to people but they are as attached to their colonostopies as some people are attached to their Covid masks.  They will never give it up.  Fools!

                    Don’t ignore your colonic health.  Have your stool tested *and* get a colonoscopy *when* there are *secondary* signs of illness.  You need not immediately jump to colonoscopy.Why do I say this?  Guess.  I put this off for 10+ years after the first signs appeared. When I finally got a colonoscopy, what they found and removed was large and cancerous.  I refused to have a colorectal removal and was not going to live my life with a bag of shit attached to my body (as was the fate of my father).I even planned how I was going to handle this “problem”.  Yeah, it was not going to be pretty, but what the hell, I’d accomplished everything in life I was responsible for.  A short walk outside onto the patio, lay back in the lounge chair by the spa, a quick pull of the trigger—appropriately aimed at the chest above the heart (never, ever shoot yourself in the head, this is waay cruel for family to see), a lightness in the head, no pain as the as the bullet has too great a shock effect and masks initial trauma pain,  faintness, then nothingness—except for the paramedics who have been called to read the note on the front door and clean up.Yeah, I had it all planned and the means and ability from a long life with these implements.So what happened?  There was one chance, perhaps smallish, that a the cancer hospital gave me, that the spread had not quite left the polyp.  No way to tell, just go home and wait it out.  Get another colonoscopy in a year—if no detectable cancer affects—to again look at the incision area.  So one year later, the colonoscopy looked at original site and no decernable cancer—but found another polyp.  This one benign.So here I am 5 years on advising folks about jogging and stretching and weight trading and so forth, while in reality not one of these things did me a damn bit of good wrt colon cancer.  Think about it.Sorry for the length, I’ve not shared this with anyone since then.  Brings back memories.

                        Thanks for that, and I’m very happy it all worked out for the best. I do know something about the dangers of colon cancer, though–it killed my pappy at the age of 62. He was not a man who took care of himself, even a little. And his lifestyle choices and innatention to his health bit him.

        Being 79 I remember our family doctor smoking cigarettes and drinking whiskey. For exercise it was smoking, drinking and playing poker. He was a good doctor who had no trouble removing my tonsils and appendix and lived to 86.  I’ve been doing Chinese Qicong for close to 40 years to get my somewhat lazy ass pumped up for work every day but have no reason to believe I’ll make it to 80 but it’s worth a try.  Good luck to all of you who are giving it your best shot.

        I finished the comments so far.  Golly, there are a lot of oldsters here.  Like me.  I do pull-ups, push-ups and free weights and farm chores.  A busy day on the farm puts in 30,000 steps  according to the fit bit.I would eat crap except my wife is a fabulous cook using the best ingredients that keep me chronically ten pounds over my target weight.I drink way too much.  Can’t seem to kick that one.  Like the ten extra pounds, it is due to just pure lack of will-power.As far as looking young, that’s hard to do with male pattern baldness, white whiskers and liver spots, but I used to be beautiful.In my youth I said I would dedicate my hearing to Rock and Roll.  Now I have progressive hearing loss.With old age comes wisdom.  Here’s my advice, kids:  Don’t be like me.

        One of the reasons Xers can’t grow up is that they were relentlessly marketed too.  “The Toys that Made Us” on Netflix really lays how TV shows and toys were pushed on young minds to trap them in a world of fantasy and consumerism.Ironically, entertainment might have been TOO GOOD for a brief period there.  If you’re a kid in say ’75 to ’85 you’re growing up with such magnificent entertainment year after year like Jaws, Rocky, Star Wars, Superman, Indiana Jones, Conan, Ghostbusters, Rambo, Terminator, etc.   40 and 50 year old guys still talking about that stuff and filling their shelves with toys and collectibles.

            The Gen-X failing to grow up is real.  Even myself, I still play old video games occasionally and own a number of consoles from the late 70s to early 80s.  But it was not until the era of social media where I found out I am pretty restrained in this area.  It is an absolute sickness. It’s even worse for Millennials.  When I was still on twitter and following retrogaming, people were uploading pictures where they live in a 2 bedroom apartment and 1 of the bedrooms is designed to look like a Walmart electronics section. All kinds of retail gizmos (like the gameboy hooked to a screen that was common in retail) and racks and racks and racks of video games.Now there is an industry of miniature collectable handheld and tabletop games aimed squarely at people my age, in their 50s.  These things get pretty expensive too.  There are people with hundreds and hundreds of these things.  There have been PnP (Plug n play) re-releases of just about every game console and home computer from the 80s and 90s all aimed squarely at people in their 40s and 50s.  Then there’s all the memorabilia. That’s just games. They buy star wars crap and all kinds of other stuff.

                            I used to make pretty good money on ebay.  You would not believe how well betamax VCRs were selling in 2005.  I trash picked a decent Sony model and got like 800 Dollars for it.  Even film projectors were fetching hundreds of Dollars. Old computers. Old video games.  All kinds of stuff.  This is crap I picked up at the flea market for $10.  It wasn’t even like working because I’m a flea market junkie.There’s a lot of stuff that was present in the flea markets in abundance that (I had no idea at the time) would fetch large sums on ebay.  If I still had large amounts of free time all in one block, I’d be still be doing it.  Ebay prices for a lot of things are out of control.  Vintage computers are in such high demand that people are actually faking chips for them!

        started CrossFit about 14 years ago. Couldn’t do a pushup and running wasn’t interesting any more. I’d donated a kidney to a brother 18 years ago and felt like I’d never recovered my fitness. Now I can do 80-100 pushup, 150+ squats and deadlifts in 15 minutes and outdo my younger gym mates. I took up motorbiking when our effing government  put in vid restrictions in ’20. I deadlifted 355# on my 70th birthday. Should be at 400# by age 80 but maybe I’m a delusional boomer described by Zman.

        It’s never too late to get started on exercise.
There’s a great story about a 93 year old Irish man who started rowing in his 70’s.  He’s now 93 and has the VO2 Max of a 30-40 year old.  Never exercised prior to this. (Richard Morgan)
Weights are great for useful strength; this kind of aerobic work in increase V02 Max is generally considered optimum for brain function as we age.

            You can still be pretty buff at 60 with weights, but the key is not to overdo it.  You don’t need to be benching 300, just enough to where the end of your set requires real effort.  Will you be an Ahnuld in his twenties? No.  But you will look respectably fit and, more import, still have good mobility and strength.  You will also avoid the flabby arms, a nice bonus.The biggest problem I come across for the older set is if you did not weight train when younger (even late 30s or early 40s) it is hard to pick it up as a stable habit later.  Not impossible, but more difficult.

        The pursuit of the infinite (e.g. growth of SV companies, ever-higher BTC and RE valuations) negates the consideration of zero.
Everything has to end…despite all the different variations of “to infinity and beyond”. People have forgotten this.
People are pursuing their own version of eternal (infinite time) utopias. It is only people who have experienced the horrors of nothingness (nihilism) who understand that all things must end and all debts must be paid off.

        Lots of good advice here.  To these I would add:If you’re a runner, stick to dirt and minimize pavement running.  I hate biking and prefer running.  My knees are fine because a) I run on dirt and b) I don’t race people.  I run for me.  If I run 4 miles and my heart rate isn’t quickly below 90bpm when I’m done, I’ve run too hard.If you’re trying to lose a few pounds: Weight Watchers’ app is terrific.  Writing down what I eat holds me accountable (and frequently keeps me from eating junk).  The app itself doesn’t force you to be a calorie counter.  It’s points-based and most of the food I eat each day = 0-2 points.  I have days where I don’t even bother entering data because the only food I ate was from their (very long) list of 0-point foods.Wear sunscreen.  My only health mistake as a young man was not doing this.  My dermatologist is grateful, I am not.  Most of my couch-potato friends are that way because they got hurt in their 20’s and 30’s.  I’m not a couch-potato, but I regret all the mini surgeries for this or that new basal cell.Body weight training is the best functional training.  Minimize the gear = minimize the spotters.  Force yourself to do things that require physical strength whether it’s carrying the groceries to the car (instead of using the cart) or moving boxes or ladders or other stuff around the house.  You’ll find out pretty quick where you’re at physically just by doing routine things.  I’m lucky to have some land, so just working on the landscaping tells me a lot about my physical fitness.If you’re doing something for somebody other than yourself, you’ll fail.  It’s a sign of low self-esteem (like tats).  My wife used to get obsessed watching the bathroom scale and I asked her one day, “Do you FEEL BETTER after all that work?” She said “Yep, my clothes fit better and I’m not as tired.  And I said “Don’t worry about the scale, then.  Do this stuff because you feel better and can do the things you want to do.”Last tip: If it ain’t fun for you, pick something else.

        This is an excellent topic. I am the guy who got carded to prove I was young enough to play in the xyz league.I was smart enough to realize when it was time to stop playing a sport that gave me that cardio, testosterone and muscle conditioning and flexibility when injuries were lurking around every corner – even though my performance was as good as ever.I found the best doctors to fix up the recurring injury spots and resolved to focus on ending strength. I feel fortunate that I had the intuition to not go for the training that only works in the 20s. I am not going to be a Navy Seal.What works very good for me is HIIT with resistance bands. I have excellent muscle tone and get some decent cardio fitness. I am working on pushing myself to better cardio. I throw in a kettle bell but only use it for specific low-to-no injury risk exercises that tone muscle groups where I need that movement with resistance.The biggest thing is to stretch. I fall in and out of a consistent 10 minutes 3 times a day stretching of the major muscle groups. Stretching is absolutely critical to ending strength – and feeling great.Looking forward to hearing other tips.P.S. That post about facing mortality in a couple decades, feeling like my best is ahead, and being a man without a country rings very true. We need to deal with the mental aspects of the situation we are living in. IRL mens groups that are having fun and also planting trees are of paramount importance for maintaining a healthy mind and a strong will to live (as opposed to staying alive).

            “Stretching is absolutely critical to ending strength – and feeling great.”
The basic yoga poses — shoulder stand, cobra, bow, forward bend and two or three others. I’ve been doing these for literally half a century (started in 1974). Of course by themselves they’re not enough — you need some cardio and some calisthenics/ resistance training. Proper diet, avoiding stress, getting enough sleep. This’ll slow down the process of aging and more importantly make your time in this world better.

            One of the best things that has happened to me in my 50s is to start playing competitive sports again. Well, if you can call beer league hockey a competitive sport. I play with lots of people younger and older than I, and it’s quite humbling. It’s great cardio with intense “sprint” sessions. Also, getting roughed up occasionally reminds me of why I like to stay in shape, but also reminds me of my limitations (which every older man should be intimately aware of).

                Was goaded into playing on the men’s church softball team. Haven’t played softball since the 90s (I’m 51). First at bat of the season:  hit a sharp grounder toward the hole at short. As I ran to first, I sank into the hole where the little league base had been taken out and filled with (not  enough) dirt. My foot hit the post where the base attaches.  Hairline fracture of fibula, grade 2 LCL sprain.I have run nearly 3000 miles in the past few years with no injuries. 60 feet toward first base, out for the season.But I did somehow beat the throw and was safe when I rolled onto the first base bag. 1.000 average. I await my silver slugger award.

        I still remember, in my early 20s, out of college, as I shifted from being an active college student to a sedentary office worker, I was putting on weight fast. Rather than freaking out and looking for a diet I could do to take the weight off, I decided to change my habits one-by-one, provided I could make those changes permanently, as in for the rest of my life. Despite scientists saying that it is impossible, the weight has stayed off me since and I’ve been pretty healthy with very few of the weird aches and pains that my peers have. God willing that will continue.The way our society teaches health, like everything else, is all wrong, and yea, it is because our lives are geared towards short-term, year zero thinking.

        I think its absolutely important that folks maintain some type of exercise routine. I spent nearly 26 years in the military and most guys stop…get fat and fall apart quickly after retirement. If u cant weight train, grab bands, do push ups and find a place to do pull ups. I spent most of my career deployed and treated each like prison. I also competed in powerlifting and strongman. I have issue with Rip and his program but as a baseline it works well. Most programs work well if you stick to them. Diet plays a huge part. Avoid belly fat, its a disease incubator. But the biggest thing is genetics and then anabolics. Test and HCG/HGH will keep off the fat, make u feel better and allow u to keep training. If you’re hurt, figure exactly what your injury is and train around it. Find a doc that will keep you under the bar and not one who tells you to “take it easy”. My training partner is 59 and still competes in strongman. He’s still getting stronger and better at his age. Don’t stop. I don’t drink or smoke (cigars) during the week no matter what’s going on. I ensure I get enough sleep and food. Jacked and tan gents!

        As my other comment awaits approval, the general lack of fitness is a result of:
A. Really, really bad commercial food including very bad franken-gmo fruits and veggies and protein. Chicken is so bad it is literally inedible now — awful rough slimy fibers through everything.B. Vibrancy making Walking impossible, to be safe you need to drive 5 miles to a “safe” store.C. Vibrancy reducing the amount of local sports-playing etc for kids AND adults (recreational softball, etc) that adults used to participate in.
Hilariously, fitness is now seen as a right-wing marker.

            Obviously, our sacred liberal democracy is highly leftist, so let’s look at what it defines as right wing markers. Working out and caring about your health is a right wing marker. Not smoking weed is a right wing marker. Going to church is a right wing marker. Not watching porn is a right wing marker. Wanting to get married and have kids in a monogamous relationship is a right wing marker. Really makes you think.

        I don’t know, and maybe it’s because I’m old myself, but from my perspective I see a hell of a lot of thought put into the fitness of old people. It’s true our culture is a youth culture, but that fact doesn’t take away from, in fact it reinforces the notion of trying to act like you’re 25 when you’re 75, including working out the same way a 25 year old works out.Not to deny that going to the gym, thereby reducing the decline of muscle mass, cardio health and all that isn’t important, but I’ll give you something even more important: cultivate your ability to assess the common risks that flesh is heir to. I’ll give you two examples from my own life.When I was a young man, I saw a fatality on the interstate. I won’t go into the horrific details, but from that moment on, fifty some-odd years ago, I have always worn a seat belt. I suspect a lot of people you see hobbling around or in wheelchairs, the obese using mobility scooters and so on have been in serious auto accidents and their present condition is the culmination of that serious accident. Now their mobility is seriously impaired. The other day, I was noticing the number of drivers who weren’t wearing seat belts. At least half of drivers today still don’t wear seat belts. It’s not my place to campaign for seat-belt usage because I believe you can’t cure stupid, but if you think you will either emerge unscathed or dead, and nothing in between can happen, then you’re kidding yourself.Another occasion where but for the grace of God I almost ended up a paraplegic because I didn’t understand the risks, I ended up fracturing two cervical vertebrae while on vacation. Life is not without risks, and I don’t advocate never having fun but just try to assess what you’re getting yourself into when you venture into uncharted territory. There’s a reason old people are cautious. It’s because we are the survivors.

        Excellent post. As a 70 year old fitness buff, I highly recommend a book called Outlive by a doctor who specializes in longevity.His theory is in sync with Z’s viewpoint that fitness should be focused on quality of life throughout your life and targeting old age. Consequently he places a high priority on grip strength as an example. The idea is when you are 80, you should want to pick up your grandkids and carry your own groceries.He lays down practical targets of what you want to be able to do exercise wise at different decades of your life. I find them very practical and obtainable.Side note: Having just moved back to the US I am shocked at how fat people are now. I knew they were but seeing it daily is distressing. We live in a consumer culture where delayed gratification and impulse control are not the goals.

        I have several books about the history of football (soccer), and it’s interesting to contrast the photos of 1930s players and those of today. Back then, everyone wanted to look older. You get players who were in their mid twenties looking like late 30s with their carefully slicked hair and moustaches. I suppose smoking 100 untipped a day didn’t keep your skin looking younger either. Contrast that today where ex-footballers in their 50s try to look like 20-somethings. Ah, the Cult of Youth!

        Early Boomer here. I started lifting weights 3 times a week in high school in conjunction with sports. Kept lifting for 50+ years. Went to  twice a week once I hit my 50s. Lighter weights as I aged. Tennis during my 30s and 40s. Got into yoga in my late 50s and found it to be a nice adjunct. Have had dogs for long time and always have done two 20-30 min. walks daily (3 on weekends).  During brief periods between dogs I never walked. Now aching joints from age and sequelae from a motorcycle accident make weights no longer attractive. I’ve started working with kettlebells, which I find to be engaging. Good for endurance, coordination, strength, and flexibility. Still walking the dogs. Lab work is always good at annual physical. While motivation is important, I still think genetics is a major factor in how fit and strong, or flabby and weak we are. Ability to work through pain and tiredness from exercise is important. There are so many who have never had the motivation to work out and stay fit. They don’t think it’s fun, which it always has been for me. They seem to not really be aware of their bodies and of the need for exercise and diet as an investment in the future.

        Regular weight training in the middle years with the goal of maintaining muscle mass will mean climbing the stairs when you are eighty…
Nothing’s guaranteed Z. You could wake up dead tomorrow. Your body might make 80…but your mind? Creepy Joe Biden’s legendary problems with stairs come to mind.

            True words, Mr. Filthie. Years ago I read that one wants the body to be completely functional until it breaks down at the bitter end in one fell swoop, like the one horse shay of Oliver Wendell Holmes’ eponymous poem.“How it went to pieces all at once,All at once, and nothing first,Just as bubbles do when they burst.Just as bubbles do when they burst.”Alas, the collapse is unpredictable and often comes in fits and starts and in surprisingly unpleasant ways.¯\_(ツ)_/¯

        Talking about youth, apparently a few Republican Senators like Vance and Rand Paul and some others want to stop the effort to amend the House Draft bill to include women 18-26, also. But Mitch McConnell is dead set on drafting them. So it looks like “Draft Our Daughters” is happening.So there you go. The draft is going to be taking everyone White. If you are not in the combat cohort (likely the terms of the service will be ten years minimum) you can expect to labor in Defense production.Meanwhile the Disney Tapes from O’Keefe have been released, basically no White males need apply at Disney, including actors and writers. Even the White guy interviewed admits he will go no further in his career (some business exec).The Deep State literally is going to copy Zelensky dragging White men and women into vans to be drafted.Looks like the fitness issue will be solved by a starvation diet of bugs and the Russian Front.

If you wish to use the concepts in Starting Strength, but in a much more joint friendly fashion, you can substitute machines for barbells. A good leg press, chest press and row or pulldown machine would get you there.

            Machines are far worse for your joints than free weights and far worse for functional fitness. They lock your limbs into artificial movement paths and remove the stabilization components of the movement. They were mostly designed and promoted as part of a 70’s exercise fad called Nautilis and HIT. Nowadays, they are mostly for advanced bodybuilders looking to refine and customize muscle appearance, not general weight trainers.Even barbell bench press is basically a machine exercise in this sense – wedging your scapulae against a bench and locking your arms into a weird position – and it’s the #1 cause of chronic injury in free weight training.If you are worried about your joints, you should prefer dumbbell exercises and learn to do movements that don’t torque your limbs away from their natural movement patterns too much.
