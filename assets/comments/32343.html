        Watching that DIE SS Karen answer questions regarding her failures to stop the assassination attempt due to a sloped roof gives me the impression they will try another way, perhaps a malfunctioning Boeing Trump is on or some looney troons shit with a falling piano. If 42% accepts any narrative and the other 30% normies just go along with it, why not? Another good point by the Z man is, ‘has Trump really learned anything?’, he makes the best VP pick out of the swamp, has the top iconic moment of the past 2 decades immortalized on a picture that goes hard AF but still calls the DIE SS great people?  Malaka, I’d have the heads of all the agents on spikes by now, how do you unify half the country who want you dead by any means and who think having troons groom children is a good thing? I think he’s too old to be that bold and become the American Cesar, and really clean house..

            The sloped roof concern didn’t surprise me from a woman. It’s bullshit, but it still kinda makes sense. (it makes sense that a woman would say that with a straight face)

            He probably is too old and normiecon to really clean house. The hopeful (if that’s allowed) is that it will be sort of a conservative version of the Biden admin, with the old dude as the face of it and an ideologically motivated army underneath him.

                That is the plan, but the hidden hand behind it isn’tat allour idea of “right,” just as current_regime’s policies of total war everywhere, worker impoverishment via inflation, etc., aren’t what the actual Marxists (all seventeen of them) want.What the Thielbund (let’s call it) wants is what we have now but run by nerdier, uglier people. What’s wrong with corporate surveillance/censorship, e.g., is that it’s weighed down by a superfluous of layer virtue-signaling “DEI,” so it’s not anefficient styleof total information control / underclass oppression. Etc.Their main thing is that the system instead of ejecting taxpayer money toward the Democrat client groups who are paid via “welfare” should send salaries and business subsidies to higher-IQ immigrants—who hate you far more than black people do and aren’t satisfied with merely stealing your bike.

The Common Man can’t take anymore Hyper-Inflation.
If Trump continues the Hyper-Inflation strategies of the Biden/McConnell/McCarthy/Johnson/Yellen/Garland/Zients era, then there will arise a Moustachio’ed Bro who steps up to the plate with a proper Fin@l S0lution to put an end to the Hyper Inflation, once and for all.

                    When Trump was president no one was bitching about inflation, the low gas prices, or the job market. So of course “this time,” he’s going to espouse biden economic policies.

            “I think he’s too old to be that bold and become the American Cesar, and really clean house.”It’s kind of circular.  He is taking all this fire because he loves the country, but that also means he thinks it can be saved.

            I remember the clips of Victoria Nuland smirking about the NordStream pipeline a week before it blew. Her comments a week before the attempted Trump shooting had the same flavor.Anyone remember that little demon Peter Strzok? Rolling his eyes, smirking, doing a little head weave when caught lying before a Congressional oversight committee?There’s some truly evil people in positions of power in our government.It’s been said that any countries leadership who doesn’t purge it’s intel agencies on a regular basis is doomed to being taken over by them.Can you imagine Xi of China, Putin of Russia, or Kim Jon Un being blackmailed by an intelligence agency?  The blackmailer and everyone he ever knew would be dead before the end of the day.I wonder if Trump, Flynn, Vance think that way.

                I haven’t gathered my thoughts completely, but the Cloud schism seems between some private sector oligarchs and the intel agencies, which obviously are out of control. Of course, the Help and Hos in elected office are blackmailed and bribed. They wouldn’t be there otherwise. But capital seems, at least, to be trending toward non-Woke (it was a pose always) and the IC is fully Woke. The indictment of Boot’s wife, along with the resignation of Cookies, means something and it seems connected.

            And that’s one of the reasons I am having trouble believing the assassination attempt was legit. Trump’s got private security in addition to Secret Service. Do you think Blackwater missed that?
Of course, the practical side of me says that he’s going to take a hit walking that back given that people died and he put on that whole emotional show at the convention last night, but nothing surprises me anymore.
And like I keep reminding you all about how Eric Trump appeared on x-22 Report twice. If you noticed, he spoke at the convention yesterday.
Hmmm.

                Where was Trump’s private security on that stage in Butler PA? Trump has a hole in his ear the size of a dime. You can see his hair through the hole. So he trusted a 20 year old kid who got kicked out of gun club in school, to take the most accurate shot in human history since William Tell shot an apple off his son’s head? Sure…

                    The point I’m making is that Blackwater or whoever he uses was also supposed to check these places out. They whiffed on such an obvious hole in security? Uh huh. If that’s the case, you should stop paying Blackwater.

                This is why the republican party is hated. But whatever. As long as they don’t think that taking out Trump and replacing him with JD Vance would be in any way acceptable, then were cool. If not, I’d caution them on such a plan.

            Yeah. The Frum stuff *just six years ago* is too much.  I start to think the lawfare stuff was not (necessarily) intended to destroy Trump, but to bring him to the table.  The judge could have given him five+ years for his 34 counts, followed by replacement at the RNC, ignominy, and death (he’s an old man). So he cut a deal:  appoint the pre-groomed veep, and in return get financial support, reasonably respectful media treatment, and have his legal troubles disappear. Nobody wants to go to jail and no-one, not least Trump, wants to be publicly defeated

                Perhaps. But there’s that rather inconvenient assassination attempt that undermines your scenario. Unless, as I stated upstream, the Power Structure is split into two factions with each operating independently and even in opposition to one another.

                    That seems highly likely. Or, not so much the power structure splitting, but a generational succession in progress, with the likes of nonagenarian Buffet having power gently prised from his hands by the likes of Thiel and Musk (who are openly backing the new ticket)

                        Well, with any luck we’ll see a nominally rightist Power Structure form around Thiel and Musk, and it will function in opposition to the current one. Might be a bit much to hope for, but not impossible.

                    Speaking of factions, I’m beginning to think the Power Structure is split into two groups on the matter of Trump. On the one hand are those (Maximalists) who advocate liquidating him. On the other are those (Minimalists) who seek merely to emasculate him and use him for their own purposes. And, as the assassination attempt shows, neither faction has executive authority over the other. Perhaps the Maximalists and Minimalists depart on other issues as well.

                        I have the feeling that there was a mini civil war between the tribe in the Biden administration and those Jewish billionaires who have been switching to Trump most likely due to israel.The only way I can see the assassination farce is that it was run by the incompetent tribe in the Biden administration and the FBI and secret service.
It was obvious that they didn’t alert the media ahead of time or assured the presstitutes Orange Man would be killed because the media didn’t know how to respond at first.

                            As someone with an “in” to the Jewish community.. they are now heavily on the right wing, even the alt-right.Almost like the new mindset is, they are willing to put up with white racism, as long as they can be openly racist about their own enemies in the Holy Land. October 7 alienated them from their left wing allies.They also don’t seem to be thrilled with the huge levels of 3rd world immigration. They aren’t anti immigrant but I think they are getting nervous at the excessive numbers and unruly behaviors of Canada’s new imports.Note that it is still entirely transactional. Liberals / the left are now seen as bad for “The Jews”. That exact, nakedly partisan phrasing has been used. I’ve never heard any consideration about what is best for greater society. Anyways, our interests align with their interests a bit, for the moment.

                                    Yes, more rational, but also an expedient. If and when they decide it’s better for them to immiserate whitey again they’ll turn on a dame push every explicitly anti-white policy they can invent. They haven’t suddently decided to start worshiping the Blue-Eyed Ice Devil.

I think that is a very optimistic take.
Personally, if Trump passes from the scene, I think Vance repudiates MAGA and goes full globalist.

                    That’s a considerable if. Trump seems pretty hale and hearty. The bigger if is if he can avoid getting bumped off before November. Of course, they could grease him after the election, which would put Vance in power. Yet if that’s the play, Trump would have sussed it out. He’s not an idiot.

                    Auron McIntyre has an interesting f stream on the nat conservative conference. Like zman, they both see problems of conservatism taking control of these movements.Auron mentions Josh Haley’s speech calling himself a Christian nationalist. Auron rightly points out that that’s not enough. I’ve said this too. For now let’s call it Christianity, but Christianity cannot infuse a non society or an anti society, which is what America is with itsfoundationalphilosophy of multiculturalism . Individuals can become Christians d they must, but because America is a pen of individuals and not a society, there’s nothing to make Christian.only nations, ie people more or less related by blood can be a society, and only then can it become Christian

                This “Novus Ordo” Catholic is tired of the liturgy wars. Further, the “traditionalist” movement inside Catholicism is easily co-opted by globalists. Most of Missal of 1962 attendees would 100% agree with the Jews being our elder brothers in the faith. Pope Benedict even capitulated to their demands.It’s bit like those neo-pagans forever thinking the future is J-pilled, based, white pagans. In real life most multi-cultural pagan groups would throw them out completely. They are too small in number to form any meaningful groups. In real life, most people actually attending a foreign language Mass are globalist liberals with a better taste in music. The Missal of 62 who know about the Jewish thing are limited to small numbers online. Thus the only serious push back on the Jews is EM Jones who has no use for the liturgy wars either.Ironically, it’s Pope Francis they have a much harder time keeping under control. He still won’t get with the program, even if he volunteered to help with their mass hysteria.

        You know what is amazing? There are still people who think elections matter, and that Mr. Trump will win in a landslide.The fact is that The Cloud People, a.k.a. The Deep State, will never allow Trump to win, much less be president. When this is over, we will see the most blatantly crooked election ever, one that would have made Idi Amin rant in envy. Of course, since the Demosheviks run every institution, all will be all right and perfectly “legitimate”.The rapid decline of the United States will continue unabated, indirectly proportional to the Democrats trying to be the most socialistic and totalitarian. Thus as our economic system collapses into irrelevance, the outrageous behavior of the Deep State will only worsen.Eventually this will all literally blow up. Someday the dirt people half of the country will get tired and rise up, but only after they decide that the only acceptable measure will be to burn down half of the country to run all of the Democrats out into exile or an early grave.I don’t care anymore and all I can say is make sure you keep your head low, and your powder dry.

            Hypothetically, there ought to come a point at which making deals with Trump becomes less costly than fighting him “at all costs.” It also isn’t a given that the Clouds remain united in perpetuity.

                Hypothetically, yes. The problem the Cloud people have created for themselves is TDS; 40% of the country hates Trump – the Orange Hitler – with a ferocity that cannot be easily pulled back. I have seen Bush hatred and I have seen Nixon hatred, but TDS is like the Rage Virus from28 Days Later. To make any deal at this point with Trump would be more jarring to the true believers than the Molotov – Ribbentrop pact.

        The reason they’re having trouble replacing Biden is optics. Consider: you spend the last four years singing his praises. You jacked an election to put him in power. All his gaffs and fumbles are white washed, cleaned and re-spun. You leaned HARD on all your people to go along with him.Now, you have to say, “Oops! Sorry everyone! My mistake, Biden’s a vegetable and unfit for duty! But! Don’t despair…!!! We have Cackles! We have Gavin Gruesome!!! We have etc etc!!” People are going to wonder if this new candidate is a bum like all the others.One simply doesn’t “replace” kings.

            And – sorry to hog the comments, Z – but I think I have to disagree about JD Vance too. Your point about dissidence being a journey is a good one, and who knows, you may be right, and I may be wrong… I hope that’s the case.But – part of that journey is typically a complete repudiation of classical politics and the fake, gay morality and the people driving them. Most relationships can’t continue after that, especially when shitlib women are involved. It’s a point of pride for them to destroy their families and especially their men.I find that this hasn’t seemed to be the case with Vance, and especially not his wife. All of a sudden her party allegiances not disclosed – but in the past she was a full blown shitlibbed shitskinned woman. Those two stink to high heaven for me… but your mileage may vary.

                    Great. Another lawyer from Yale. She also worked for progressive woke people in California.As for JD – his resume is a photocopy of Pete Buttibuttblaster’s – all the checkmarks are right where they should be, i’s are dotted, t’s are crossed.Look – you guys may be right… but you should not necessarily be scornful of those that might disagree with you. JD was forged and purified in a conservative furnace. His wife is a lifetime establishment hack. All I have to go on is what I see. My experience is that when these people are parachuted in from nowhere… good things seldom result.

                        I agree. The couple screams “Produced by globalism”. Yes, within the culture of our overlords there are people disagreeing about how fast we should disintegrate society and how much we should use Americans, rather than serve them. Some of them even seem sane. Some of them are even against the willful killing of not even born babies.That does not mean that there’s a fundamental disagreement in worldview or about who makes the bestest decisions. Women with the right degrees from anywhere on the planet make the correct decisions, apparently. Vance seems to be chosen his wife as for him.There are scenarios that might “activate” JD Vance into a very radical leader. However, for the moment he’s mostly Pence 2.0, for the millennial GOP crowd. It’s not like Trump is known for his gift of learning from his past mistakes when it comes to character.

                        Given his upbringing, most people would have thought that someone like Vance, if he went to law school at all, would have attended a tier 4 school, not Yale. Perhaps he was recruited into the system during his stint in the Marines. Things sure seem to have gone great for him since he left the service. I read that one of his law professors encouraged him to write his memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, which has been lauded by the mainstream press and no doubt has allowed him to join the millionaire class. Remember that Obama also wrote a successful memoir at a young age when he had few accomplishments. Book deals seems to be a way that the system makes payoffs to people it supports.

                            Those, my friend, are excellent points. I have to admit that I knew next to nothing about Vance until his name cropped up among the finalists for Trump’s VP pick. And suddenly there he is, on the stage with the Donald, with an oh so perfect resume for public presentation, like an award-winning show dog. Is he a quisling? Maybe. We know that the Donald has a record of picking terrible people for important posts and that he appears to be easily manipulated, because of his egotism, the way Col. Hogan handled Col. Klink.

                        Good assessment, Glen, but two things can be simultaneously true:
I think that is likely. An example of this is Tulsi Gabbard, who was supposed to be The Strong Woman of Color Superstar but was passed over for Kamala Harris. Hell hath no fury can apply to men, too, and something may have gone awry with Vance’s schedule.
My position is distrust and verify.

                        The concern I’d have with Vance is that he’s a guy who found a way out in the system (Marine Corp). 39 iirc and possibly VP— that’s a heavy dose. Not the circumstance that you’d expect to produce a skeptic. I mean, I’m giving him a chance, but he looks like borg man.Read the review of his book on Unz. Got the impression there’s something going on wrt making whites victims, so that we have rights in this system. Not necessarily that it’s Vance’s angle, but something in the political air. ‘Re-africanization’ I think is a word the reviewer used. More whites becoming black, etc.

                            That is what they are doing in Canada. If white people have even 1 “indigenous” ancestor, they can get their Indian status card. That puts them on the government gravy train for life.
So now you have a bunch of white people pretending to be victims, screaming about how much they hate white people. It gives them an “out” to the anti-white civilization by turning them into victims. Trans/LGBT is another “out” for white guys. Other than that, you have military.

                Not sure if anyone heard her speech at the RNC introducing him, but there were some subtle tells in it if you are a savvy active listener as I have become living and working around the sh-tlib hive for decades in the sewer of DC. My radar is VERY tuned to the language for that reason.She described JD as “meat and potatoes” but then went on to express that he has melded his diet aroundhersand not visa-versa. Learning to cook and eat Indian and vegetarian.When they met, “he was so curious and interested and wanted to know everything about my culture.”Again, he is molding himself to her strange alien culture and ways. Instead he should have said- “You are not in India anymore, you are in hillbilly land now. We eat meat and potatoes. Let’s talk about how YOU can become more like US, Americans.”This is not what we heard. What we heard is how street shitters get their full cultural benefits under the new and improved Republican big tent. The only thing I heard from JD Vance evenremotely targetedat Whites was “I’m from Middletown Ohio and I am telling the people from places like that you are not forgotten.”Never used the phrase ‘poor Whites’. And they are not forgotten? Talk is cheap motherf-cker. SHOW IT TO ME. Show me the reopening of coal mines, production facilities, manufacturing plants, automaker floors, etc. etc.Sorry but I am highly skeptical of this dude, he says some of the right things but my BS detector is in the red too.

                    The vibe I am picking up is that the Repubbies are trying to claim the street shitters as THEIR immigrants (having already ceded the other muds to the left). Of course the question of who is really claiming whom is probably open

                        Recall also the Steinleighter paper in 2001. He was concerned about immigration becoming an issue for Jewish power. He proposed that, “Jews and Asians form an alliance to divide and conquer.”Tue Regime is extremely unstable. 10/7 and what it revealed about how solid Occidental Population Replacment is turning out is in early days of shockwaves. It was implemented by the likes of Specter and her hubby and Steinleigjrer, Mayorkas and stateside tribesman. May have turned out to be catastrophic.Many wolves are circling the American corpse. All have hidden agendas. Vivek? Wolf! Hazony? Why the hell is Tel Aviv defining Conservatism across Europe and America masked as the Edmund Burke Society? Wolf!Look at Vance’s littlesockless shoes when he hours to Palestine OH for his photo op? His entrepreneurial success is sketch as we don’t even know what companies he financed. Two years ago his venture fund was ghetto. They have worked on a facelift but it looks manufactured. His military service is pretty ordinary to lame as well.Nice points in his speech last night. Words are wind. Deeds are iron.For Vance, and any white man near power, there is a great opportunity in going rogue. You could go down in history as the one who saved all of Occidental man, his homelands and civilization. Stave off annihilation and plant the seeds for a return to glory.That stands waiting for him. I wonder if in end of 90s Yeltsin Russsia, Putin had the same destiny as a Russian to snatch his Fatherland back from the Wharton/Yale/Harvard/MIT/Wall St gangster operation.He played them. Perhaps Vance has the wit to do the same facing the same mobsters who are the wiser for being played once.Wolf! In that case, Our Wolf.time will tell.

            25th Amendment has proven to have a fatal flaw:
The current Cabinet would have to agree to remove Biden.
The new President (particularly now) would be well advised to remove/replace the existing Cabinet members with their own team.
It looks “strong”, shows a “new direction”, especially in a run up to a national election where the overthown boss (and his Cabinet) were pretty awful.
No Cabinet member is going to vote himself out of a job.  No executive would hire someone who overthrew their own boss.
25th Amendment is deader than disco.

        There are two kinds of time, and consequently two kinds of predictions about the future. There is “time as destiny” and there is “time as incident.” Destiny pertains to theformof time, incident pertains to its accidents.The form of time is easy to predict. Of a male child born today, we can say with certainty that in 30 years he will be a man, in 60 years he will be an old man, and in 90 years he will be a dead man. Nothing can possibly alter the course which destiny has set, unless an incident intervenes to cut him down in his prime.But whether he will be wearing a green or a yellow shirt on his 30th birthday is not in anybody’s foreknowledge, because it is incidental.The form of future time is easy to discern in its broad outlines: We know that America will retreat from the world stage, harden, and become more nationalistic, because this physically inevitable, but we do not know whether we will get to this state by wise and constructive actions or by the blows of fate hammering our foolishness into the foreordained shape.

                Brazil has a somewhat clean north/south geographic break and the Balkans don’t or at least didn’t. The United States has both aspects, so that is a hard question to answer.

                    Brazil is meaningless soccer nationalism. There is a bit of White nationalism in the south, but it’s mild even compared to the US.The Balkans OTOH is fragmented, every ethnic group furiously against everybody else around (they seem much less concerned with invaders from far away places).

                        The point is Brazil does not have the geographic confusion as is the case with Balkans. The United States has megalopolises that will have numerous green zones and areas like Appalachia that will be outward looking. I cannot think of a similar historical parallel.

        Since he is such a CivNat Normie Boomercon, it is easy to forget sometimes that Trump is a B List Cloud, complete with billions. A similar person in Gates, who also gets mau-maued despite his wealth and influence. The assassination attempt against Trump has rattled several other Clouds, apparently. This leads to what is most important since politics are fake and gay and meaningless:A schism has opened up among Clouds. You pretty well have nailed who is on which team. There is no way to view this as anything other than a positive development. The schismatic Clouds most likely want their own Help and Hos to protect their interests. And another thing easy to forget is that even some Clouds are just vaguely aware of how utterly rotten the system is, which means they, too, can be redpilled to a degree.As for Biden, it seems pretty obvious that the Clinton faction wants him to stay in the game and the Obama faction wants him out. While I think Obama’s Cloud masters trump, no pun intended, the Clintons’ Cloud masters are thoroughly embedded in the Apparat. That side of the ledger is about to get quite sporty, so I don’t know whether they are about to have a run of good fortune, and, in fact, rather doubt it.And pulling back, the wheels are coming off, and we are moving from the slowly to suddenly stage. It is a miracle it took this long.Finally, good point about the Congressional Black Caucus. Harris apparently is not considered part of their tribe.

            Not sure about the Clinton position in all this. As I mentioned yesterday, they have been unusually quiet, at least in public. That could suggest that they support Biden, or it could suggest they are remaining neutral in order to stake out a kingmaker position at the convention. I doubt Hillary has entirely abandoned her own ambitions, but even if her own health precludes this, I have no doubt she wants a say in who gets anointed.
An “open” (brokered) convention would be natural habitat for the Clintons, like pigs in shit.

        You know the powers that be are desperate when Yuval Harari states:   “If Trump becomes president it will be the end of the global order.”
Quite a dramatic statement but also no where near the truth.    It does show how unstable and delusional the cloud people are.    Russia, China, India, Iran and the BRICS plus will eventually cause the end of their “Global Order”  not Trump.

                Exactly, Al. The enemy of my enemy also can be my enemy. Putin, Russia, BRICS have every right to do their own thing, and the Ukraine cluster has led to hundreds of thousands of needless white deaths. Even so, Putin, Russia and BRICS are not us. The former two certainly are Western adjacent but note “adjacent.” You see the same with Gaza. Both populations there are problems for Westerners, and both are to be distrusted (obviously Russia/Putin is far less of a problem than Israel/Netanyahu, but still). We have enough intra-tribal problems without looking for more outside of our world.

        I wonder about JD Vance, if he could go back in time knowing what he knows now, would he still marry an Indian woman?10+ years ago was a very different time. As a regular white guy, kind of conservative, he probably didn’t care much about race, probably didn’t see race. A pretty brown girl cozies up to him, and sure, why not, she also shares my American values, and suddenly he’s married.Let’s be honest, the vast majority of white men have probably slept with or dated a woman of color at some point. And it wasn’t really a big deal as a libertarian, or a colorblind conservative. I’m convinced that if I was 10 years older I would probably be married to a woman of colour. Of course my behavior has drastically changed now, but back in the day, I didn’t think race mattered that much.He seems quite heavily redpilled now. But it is of course too late to back out of his marriage and family life.It’s important to remember how new “our side” really is, and also how new the anti-white  agenda is.  He may make a different choice were he in his prime today. As a white guy there is no room for you as someone who is just a normal straight white dude.

            Quite possible. I know of a guy who has miscegenation remorse who would fit that bill.
Also, it is not uncommon for people from lower class backgrounds to have self-loathing, realize how stupid that is, and to come out of it.
I don’t trust Vance, but that is more gut than anything else and the possibility of extinguished color-blindness and self-loathing tempers that.

            Maybe you’re right but he named his 4 year old son Vivek.
Also, his wife is Hindu but he converted to Catholicism. Yeah, Biden and Pelosi are supposedly Catholic because they were born into nominally Catholic families.Vance was serious enough about his faith to convert (which requires more than just saying you’re Catholic), but there is no problem with a Hindu wife?  It’s not like she’s Lutheran.

            I wonder if marriage to someone that far removed from your blood is even valid. But it’s a mess. He says America is not an idea but a people. Well, what makes a people?
the unplugging from the lie of multiracialism is going to be very painful if it even happens. Most whites will never give up their arrogant, impious views that there’s only one race the human race and racism is evil

        I haven’t listened to the show.One implication of these recent events is that from here on out, no contender for the Presidency can trust the state’s protection. This means that any contenders will need to bring their own guard. This is the rise of an emperor’s personal guard that will have to become the norm. Biden refused to provide RFK with SS protection. It is likely that Mayorkas and Cheatle conspired not to kill Trump but to put B and C players on his detail. It is coming out that this is indeed the profile of people on his team at the rally.This is a war. On the one hand you have an alien elite who want to transform America into Global Economic Adminstrative Zone Prime. What used to be Canada, the US and Latin America will be from south to north and east to west this gigantic shopping mall.I don’t the model is Brazil. I think the model is Dubai. You need software engineers? Don’t forecast and plan on how to run America, just bring them in from India, Africa … … Need to build more steal and glass rectangles into the clouds? Replace the old scabs with new scabs again from India, Africa, Asia … …On the other hand you have a nation. Albeit that it is deracinated and atomized there are still signs of life of a people who are committed to America and, what scares the regime above all, they do still have a fading but still faintly present racial identity. Of course, The Dubaification Regime is stoking that match in the doorway into something white hot.Be proud of yourself. Thank your ancestors. Thank your ancestors Gods for they are Our Gods. Acknowledge them everyday and see yourself in that continuum. Pledge to them your honor. Look at your posterity and kith and kin and acknowledge your duty to them as your duty to yourself. Every day make a simple pledge to honor the past, honor yourself, and honor your future with honor, humility and valor. Be prepared for heroic action in the form of collective heroic action. With patience with wisdom with conviction to go step by step with quality over quantity promise The Great Continuum of Occidental Man to play your part.Carry out your duties my fellow Americans.

                Destitute Venezuelans now camp out daily at the four corners of an intersection down the block from me. They beg non-stop. Apparently, the government and NGO grants aren’t enough for them. Blacks congregate around out of envy for the gibs. Whites go out their way to toss money at them.

        The problem the Regime has is no longer with just Trump. Its Trump’s GOP. And every younger GOP person knows that the Regime no longer wants or needs them to play Washington Generals to the Democrat Harlem Globetrotters.Everyone on the planet knows that there was a bureaucratic attempt to kill Trump by removing SS agents, scheduling Dr. Jill’s event to draw off even more suddenly, and designating only the most incompetent Melissa McCarthy agents. People know and notice Jack Smith and Biden get protected by big beefy White men. Everyone knows the Regime planned the assassination attempt by removing any real protection for Trump.Any attempt at a Draft which is coming, will cause widespread resistance. White guys are not going to fight and die for Ukraine. Mitch McConnell got booed at the Republican Convention; power and money and control are Trumps.Trump if elected will take vengeance on those who planned his assassination. Which includes Mayorkas, Cheatle, Garland, and like Nudelman, Kagan, and others. They know this. They know that any Biden or similar candidate “miraculously” finding 35 million votes at 4 AM will not be believed, and will be fought including by Thiel, Musk, Ackman, and many others. That unlike last time there will be very large amounts of strife, if the fake is attempted.Moreover, the people ensconced in the bureaucracy are afraid they will be the ones set up as chumps and fall guys for anything and everything, by new people. Remove Biden, and Mayorkas, Cheatle, and Garland certainly will be left holding the bag as the patsy for say, Newsom, or Whitmer, or Buttgig, or Warren, or Kamala.They system needs some fall guys, and they know they are it; hence they will do all they can do to keep Biden and just rule by decree. So they don’t get hung out to dry.[Note: the SS continues to protect Biden and others. If it was incompetence, they would have fired Cheatle. That Cheatle continues to be the head of it means she did what she was ordered to do.]

            That’s an interesting thought about the minions worried about being scape-goated. I hadn’t considered it because I assumed the minions were assigned by the regime at large, not chosen partisans of a particular faction but you could very well be right. Negotiating assurances must also be going on. I still don’t think it likely they let Trump just win the election fair and square and live with any consequences. I also don’t think he can break out of his core optimism about some kind of a restoration of what we were in the past and therefore act effectively even if he did somehow end up in the office again.

So they don’t get hung out to dry.You know who I wouldn’t want to be right now since sacrificial lambs will be offered up either way? A federal field agent who kicked in Normie’s doors at 6 a.m. and terrorized his family. A DOJ prosecutor who is little more than a criminal. A MIC contractor who is both disposable and greedy. Most of these types are far too stupid to see they already are scheduled to take the fall and that day is on the horizon. I wouldn’t completely discount someone higher up the food chain like Mayorkas or SS Karen being put in leg irons and doing the march of shame, either, although that is much less certain. It will be limited, of course, but the Day of the Volcano Toss draws near.

            Don’t care that she’s not white, as many—maybe even most—fine women are. But she’s Indian, and every last one of them is an ugly, reeking asshole, like if Jews were animalistically rather than intellectually evil and they always just emerged from a pit under an outhouse. In every skull-elongating lip-plating bone-through-the-nose African tribe, there’sonepretty girl. The perfectly uniform repulsiveness of Indians is a reminder not to trust in probability.

American conservatives demand that their leadersappear to behomosexual pedophiles. If they don’t set off full DEFCON 1 gaydar, Christians won’t have them. Used to it. Don’t care.What we must nooooootice is that whites worldwide have been sent a message: There will be noIndian-excludingoptions for our leadership anywhere, in any field, ever again. Those “people” have been chosen, not by us, to be our commissars/zookeepers. We can’t stop it, but we can still say they’re shit-eating monsters and it’s wrong to fuck them.

                I get what you are saying and agree to a point, but Indian women are more attractive than black women.  I find maybe the top .001% of black women attractive.  I see them on a daily basis, so it’s not like I’m just not used to them.Indians out jewed the jews.  They are way more ethnocentric than even Jews. They might even be as ethnocentric as blacks.  Blacks wake up in the morning thinking about being black and they go to bed at night thinking about being black. We tend to not notice it because they aren’t particularly successful.But we get elite Indians (elite in India, that is) here.  Add in their ethnocentrism and you get a very dangerous people to have here.

                American conservatives demand that their leaders appear to be homosexual pedophiles.Best line in the entire thread, in no small part due to its simple and total truth.Since homosexuality has been normalized for a long time now and pedophilia of any flavor appears close to marketability, surely the TLA’s weep a bit as those Old School tools rust in the shed. Does this account for all the recent outright graft and bribery scandals (because the old timey blackmail stuff no longer works)? Should someone tell Miss Lindsey, etc., it is safe? Or is their perversion actually staying in the closet since the all-clear/queer? ‘Or is the new hidden perversion mass graft and wet beaks for different reasons (pro-tip: it is, please share!)?The RNC was Fag Fest 2024. I’m cool with the stale honesty and see the contours of Act II, The Stealing, Coming to a State Rep Near You!When does bribery come out of the closet? All of the Ukraine and previous Covid packages indicate that reveal surely is close. Government work is an undercompensated service, by gum, so why (TLA’s) keep it in the dark? Miss Lindsey and Co. there is so much more to freely admit once the thrill/threat is gone! But Viagra costs money, yes.

            None of those “spread the seed” type countries amounted to anything white. Whether in South America, Philippines, etc. They are all brown today. We already saw what happens in both cases.White genes are too recessive. You cannot bleach or out-breed them on a mass scale unless there was some kind of mass eugenics whitening program (science fiction novel, not real life).Our only success will be from breeding with our own women and producing our own children, for example, like Anglos and Germans in America, Anglos and French in Canada, Anglos in AUS/NZ, Germans in Brazil, Dutch Mennonites in Latin America. Even in Africa, Dutch / Germans still exist.

        OT: Here’s a current example of the dysfunction of the managerial state:Rude awakening for thousands of Paris tourists arriving for OlympicsThe first day of the Paris Olympics security perimeter led to almost immediate chaosPARIS — Eight days ahead of the start to the2024 Olympic Games, the Paris security perimeter around theSeine River, the site of the opening ceremony’s boat parade, officially went into effect Thursday morning. The scene could only be described as chaotic.Thousands of people trying to cross the Seine — on bikes, in cars and on foot — were flummoxed by a blockade of security checkpoints along the river restricting access for Parisians and tourists alike unless they had a preapproved QR code that justified the need for travel within the perimeter. No signs were at any of the security checkpoints explaining the closures or security pass program; instead, Paris police officers individually spoke to a stream of confused pedestrians simply trying to reach their destinations on the other side of the river.Those who didn’t have the security pass were directed to two bridge crossings on either end of the Seine, miles apart, and all were forced to cross on a single, tight, temporarily gated sidewalk that felt like a Disneyland line from hell.More here including pics:https://www.sfgate.com/olympics/article/paris-olympics-security-perimeter-causes-chaos-19581623.php

                        There’s that, yes. But the airport humiliation ritual is over fast enough, and you can be in a rented car, trundling through ridiculously white villages in no time at all.
Old Europe is still there, out in the sticks, but it’s disappearing fast so I’d do my pilgrimage soon if you want to see it.

                    Up until fairly recently, I loved the Winter (read white) Olympics. However, the insufferable network television coverage has made watching them an exercize in masochism. Hence, if a Hutessa managed to finish in the top 10 of the women’s biathalon then the world stopped rotating and NBC immediately struck a coin. Well, you get the photo. Dieversity is why we can’t have nice things anymore.

            The Boys is now familiar terrain to me that I no longer tread on. This has happened MANY times in the past few years. It is the new woke jew honeypot. They put out a very compelling series with a big budget and a first season that is 100% on the level to get their hooks into you. To get you invested basically, like a drug dealer.Then, invariably, by Season 2 or 3, the woke f-ckery gets dialed up to 11 either directly or steadily. I have had my ass burnt a number of times now in this way to such an extent that I simply won’t watch a Season 1 ofanythinganymore. I am not going to set myself up for woke lefty jewish poisoning, I value my free time and my mind far too much to fall for this again.

                The Boys tv show handed out merch at places they may have had say, Camel cigarette merch people at that gave you free cigarettes in return for scanning your id, but when that was outlawed the odd The Boys type movie merch people moved in.

        I guess I’m a doomer or wet blanket or whatever, but it is totally bizarre to have the podcast on the borg and skinsuits followed up by multiple instances of praising a guy who has skinsuit written all over him.It isn’t unreasonable to think that the bore hivemind might adapt over time and realize that Jeb Bush doesn’t work as a skinsuit anymore and that skins might need to mouth some populist ideas now to blend in. I’m going to press X to doubt on anyone who ever thought Trump was “America’s Hitler”, unless they really do something to show that they’ve changed their colors. Trump has never been even remotely like Hitler, so that is the sort of thing that only a fanatic or an imbecile would ever say.Also, pampering over the race mixing is a little weird. I’m sure there are exceptions, but as a rule, it takes a few screws loose to conclude that breeding with an alien culture is ones best bet. It’s a total dick move to have half-breed kids too, one thing to choose one’s passion over one’s culture, totally another to create little lives with each foot straddling a line and nowhere to truly call home. This isn’t some ethnonationalist thing either, as I have noted many times on different sites, “whiteness” is a stupid, poorly defined concept at present time, you cam easily make the argument that SWPLness is a defining characteristic of being white but few people on this side ever do, hmm. There are good logical reasons why almost all cultures frown on going outside the race/culture.In a way the whole Vance thing is a blessing though, as it finally convinced me of what Z is always saying, there ain’t no voting our way out of this. Just more heads we win, tails you lose, even if it was the best of a bunch of bad options.

            To understand not only the race mixing, but the naming of his children after the foreign culture, you have to understand his loathing and shame at his own (sub)culture and people.Maybe the one thing that could change my mind about Vance is if he focuses as VP on combating what is going on across rural America and particularly in his own area, Appalachia.  It started 25 years ago. As opportunity moved out and oxy moved in.  It started largely in Appalachia because it was never all that strong to begin with.  The liberals have always hated these people with a special venom.But I’m not holding out for this.  Back when his book was released and he was doing the rounds, I listened to couple of his book promotion podcasts (I haven’t read the book).    It always struck me as making fun of them and deep shame rather than a call to action.  I don’t really know what a VP could do to really start combating the deterioration, both moral and economic of this segment of the White population, but he should at least try.  It should be his pet project the way Michelle Obama made school lunches her pet project or how Hilary tried to make HC her pet project.

                I had a major brain-fart here and started comparing the VP to the first lady.Still, I don’t think there is much that a VP can do other than support the president to try and restore economic sanity to the country and above all, bring back the jobs this class of people can do.  There always was and always will be an underclass, but it doesn’t have to be the size it is today.  It is not normal to have 100k plus people OD every year and another 50k offing themselves.

                    Hard to describe scale of the cultural damage. Crank and its heirs are more than what rock crack was to the blacks, because the whites still haven’t gotten over the continuing waves of new variations. It’s now as much a part of the cultural background as Cartel is to Mexico.
It’s like a goddam Kaufmann Plan for white rural America. Now I see what the Chinese were bitching about in 1852. Poisoning the well indeed.

            “Malevolent neglect?” You’re being rather charitable. Even if you left the bestrooftopsniper location wide open, kept your team inside that location immobile during the nerve-racking experience of the shooter bear crawling around on the metal roof over their heads (just sitting through a rainstorm in such a building will give you the idea), prevented your counter-sniper teams from getting itchy trigger fingers over the better part of half an hour while they and the perp peered at each other through their scopes and he lined up his kill shot on the president, you’d still have to factor in the odds of having a random lone, crazed gunman wandering onto the site of one of Trump’s rallies carrying a heavy 14-foot ladder, assault rifle, ammunition and tripod a mile from his Hyundai Sonata (which must have the cargo capacity of Snoopy’s doghouse) and somehow making it through security with all these encumbrances; then fortuitously stumbling upon the open sniper location and using the ladder (which would have to be just the right height) to clamber up onto the roof to take advantage of all your “lapses.”

        the Van Gogh treatment”it’s the ear!” a sentence you never would otherwise hear in a speech. I turned the speech off after he said drill baby drill. it was boilerplate trump after a while. I’m not anti trump but my stars how low can a people get talking about a convo with your doctor in such an important speech.There’s an interesting book about rhetoric by an individual calling zimself farnsworth which uses dozens of examples from anctual speeches of English annd anmerican speeches . the author is asked why he doesn’t use contemporary politicians speeches:“today’s politician tends to be a creature of very modest literacy and wit who spoils what he touches.”when I think about people of all political stripes what most unites them is obsession with the practical. I think one of the great victories of the devil has been to cut us off from the traditions of the past in high education. Even Voltaire could write in Latin.talking about a conversation with your doctor about blood vessels in the ear is an example of the mundane. Multiculturalism is a large part of this focusing on the practical because it’s muh racist (and absurd) to make little Vivek learn Latin and the trivium.im ahem all ears for your podcast!

Also I would not want to attend an event where I was getting my balls fanned every 2 minutes. That would turn anyone into an asshole. If I get nominated, fellas, they can have their convention but I’m going to take a vacation in Bhutan that week.

            Actually, they would sweep to victory in a way you cannot imagine. Landslide against Trump. Lefties are hopelessly lost in the DEI cult.

        As part of the RNC’s campaign plan, Netanyahu is coming to flex on our Congress next week.  It will be good for America First Inc but is bad for real Americans.The Prime Minister of Israel will browbeat our corrupt Congress, he will demand more money.  He will brag about all the innocents he has murdered with the last money they gave him. He will pound the Gaza wedge deeper into the borg left.  And all of these new America First Republicans will compete to see who can bow lower to this gargoyle.What Vance needs to understand:no blood for Israelamnesty for all white political prisonerscease all federal anti-white activityinvestigation and prosecution of ant-whites in the FBI and the intelligence agenciesuntil the above is met and the material conditions for white Americans improve, counter-recruiting of the military by white veterans will continuealso, stop following anti-Mamaw degenerates on X

                There are 300 + million people in this country. Out of all that number, surelysomeonecan be found whodidn’twrite a book wherein he backstabs the White working class poor he claims to have been reared amongst? Or who doesn’t blame all the destruction of Globalism on its victims? Or who didn’t graduate from the Globalist Training School And Mystery Religion Annex that is Yale “University”?How about someone whoisn’tmarried to a Curry-lanche POC, with the half breed children to match? Can we find someone like that? Out of our 300 + million? Someone whodoesn’tembody miscegenation, and elitism,  and disdain for your fellow Whites? Somebody with 2 ounces of discernable loyalty or racial awareness?Tell you what, I’ll even settle for one who wasn’t attacking Trump and all his alleged policies last Thursday afternoon, before suddenly suffering an attack of Acute Venality and switching horses midstream like Tonto after an overdose of Adderall-laced Ivermectin.” Fine! Who do you recommend instead!?” is such a Reddit tier response.“I don’t want Charles Manson to cater my wedding.”“Fine! Who’syourpick, then!?”“Ummm, how aboutliterallyanybody elseexcluding Jeffrey Dahmer or John Wayne Gacy?”How about Dr. Ben Carson? He wouldn’t be my first pick because he isn’t White, but at least he is nominally Christian. I mean, Seventh Day Adventists are a lot closer to the Christianity of this nation than the elephant-man Ganesha.My pick is the guy whowon’tdrag Ganesha into the Oval Office. I can see it now, the Presidential Seal coated in ghee while little Vivek tells his sister Anjali how George Jefferson refused to tell a lie after he defeated Nag and Nagaina in the cherry tree behind the 7/11.Or maybe Matt Gaetz. Maybe that guy, with a proven track record of defying the Cabal, would be a better bet than this grifter JD Cants (the noun, not the contraction).Is there some law preventing a VP drawn from the private sector? Can no-one of integrity and intelligence be found, wheresoever we turn our dreary gaze across the land?No, theonly possible choiceis this greasy little charlatan whom nobody has heard of before until he is announced as  Our Only Hope.Just like Obama before him.

        Since the regime hasn’t officially denied the reports about Biden, I think it’s safe to say there’s a strong possibility he drops out of the race, but finishes out his term.  I’ll be a skeptic right up until it happens, though.  If the Biden’s don’t quit, there’s nothing that can be done without a 1968-level spectacle.  Obama is not going to risk any kind of American comeback under Trump.  If Biden stays, all this “drop out” talk ends probably by next week.  If he drops out, it’ll be good fun watch who Obama has been planning to replace Biden with.And then, whoever they try to install, Democrats have to somehow run on the “Everything Biden did, we just won’t f$$k it up” platform.  It should turn out to be our first true Black vs White election.  They’ve been trending that way.If they let Harris take over, probably 90% odds she picks a brown/female running mate, possibly a lesbian, lol.

            Just saw a news quip stating that all the “Biden Family Quit” stuff was fake news and that Joe is in it for the haul so who knows.  The competency crisis knows no end.  The GOP had the easier task of having four years to figure out a way to neuter Trump and didn’t come close to figuring out a way to do it, and the Dems had four years to figure out how to get an alternate candidate after running what they had to know was an “emergency candidate” and one who couldn’t even win the race legit the first time.

                Yes, the detailed accounts of an alleged plan are fake news. Someone is telling Biden to stay put. He went into hiding to let the tide roll out. The Clinton types want him to remain put, I think, and the Obama faction wants him out.
Interesting to watch this play out.

                    I can almost guarantee you Biden wants to stay put and that’s what counts. He’s spent 50 years wanting to be President. Mrs. Biden wants to be First Lady. He’s not going to give up now because he’s unpopular.Not everything can be explained by group decision/influence.

                        HRC has announced her support for Biden to remain in the race. I don’t disagree with you at all–Mrs. Biden had special First Lady music written for her, after all, but people also have the old prick’s back.

                            I would agree with that, too. There are people who will support a personal decision.  “It’s My Turn Now” Clinton may deeply sympathize with Mr. “It’s My Turn Now”.

                                As JHK noted on his blog, “not many years ago, the party was broke and had to be bailed-out by the Clinton Foundation.”
The Clintons own the DNC now, a successful usurpation by ambitious underlings.
Obama, an ambitious underling of the Clintons, then usurped Her Majesty (edit: with the Thielbund)
Over yonder is the Soros Maximalists versus the Adelson Minimalists, or DNC v. RNC corporations
Add in the Thielbund youngsters wanting their shot, and I think the American portion of the Game of Thrones is becoming more clear.

                    I think Obama wants Harris because her stupidity allows him to play Putin to her Medvedev (2008-2012).  Everyone knew Putin was calling the shots.The Clinton types want both of them gone.  Hillary wants a rematch.  That’s why Stephanopolous wrote about it being time for Biden to go.Then you have the Pelosi faction which wants Newsom installed.lastly, the IC is a faction.  They want a play dough type candidate they can control.  Think Nikki Haley or DeSantis.  Somebody who is empty and controllable.The latter 3 have good reason to fear Harris.  She is stupid-dangerous, which risked getting us all killed.  She has always been Obama’s insurance policy against removing Biden.

                        The leftwing is just as incompetent at politics as it is at governance. Having full control of propaganda organs that actually commanded a (misplaced) degree of confidence prevented this type of cluster for a long time. That armor has been peeled off and, hence, this is what you get. They always were this bad at their life mission but in the past it could be hidden. That’s no longer possible.It is unraveling at an increased rate of speed now. God only knows where and how it stops but this process cannot be halted. We are watching change in real time.

        The problem people have with JD Vance is loyalty. Lee Kwan Yue noted that in a multicultural society, people vote their race, ethnicity, and religion. Not their ideology.Vance is non-starter because his loyalty is not to White people. Very visibly, his loyalty is to Indians. Over Whites. How much clearer can it get?Nor indeed are White guys at the top of selection criteria. Rather, the bottom. There are stories after stories, loser White guy because he brings White knowledge with him rises to the top in the native environment and ends up marrying the native princess and becoming the native leader. Dances With Wolves, Avatar, there was one real life example of that with the Spanish and some Sergeant that deserted and led the Maya, even marrying their princess and getting the face tattoos. Outside of Dark Ages / Medieval Europe White guys beta-maleness (adaptive then in times of want, mal-adaptive now in times of plenty) don’t really have much to offer. Wow a whole lifetime of devotion and resources from an average dude. Not the stuff of lady tingles.As for Disney, they are run by lesbians, gays, weirdo deviants married to Wiccans (no not kidding) so they make Star Wars for themselves, basically its lesbian space witches (Diesel not lipstick variety) and Sith bodice ripper female fan fiction now. Disney does not care because they bought Lucasfilm to destroy the heroes not make money off them. Same with Marvel. Heck Disney CEO Bob Iger bought a controlling stake in Angel City FC, a women’s soccer club, with the club valued at $225 million (from initial investors Natalie Portman, Alex Ohanian, and Ohanian’s wife Serena Williams). Even at say 30% thats a waste of money since women’s sports make zero dollars — but true believers are true believers. [The smarter money got out].What is very likely to happen is that the Regime will create some incident, cancel all elections, have mass arrests of Trump, his supporters, most Republicans and most of his oligarch backers, and institute emergency rule. At this point they have to — the Regime cannot wait until post election to send US troops to Ukraine and start a massive draft (White guys only of course don’t worry). This Draft will include older guys also for Defense work. See you all in the Patriotic Work Camp #56328. I believe its slogan at the front gate is “Work Makes You Covid-Free!” The Regime can always arm up the “migrants” and “newcomers” to go attack White people to put us all in camps or at least try. Ukraine is collapsing, now, so they have to move, now. They can’t wait and the US Army’s latest Whitepaper estimates 50K casualties every two weeks, requiring a massive draft now.Biden and his huge crony network and Dr. Jill and “the smartest man I know” First Crackhead are not leaving. Strippers, blow, and mansions don’t pay for themselves.

            It’s going to be Hillary or Big Mike. Harris is just as big a loser as Biden would have been. They need a candidate who can get them close enough to pull off a plausible steal. Unless they’re rigging it for Trump this time, which seems bizarre, but it’s hard to know for sure what to think anymore. In that case, they would go with Harris.

            They’ve built the most backstory for Whitmer. Why do we even know who she is?
Michigan is the foremost laboratory of Our Democracy, with the fakest vote counts, flimsiest political persecutions, and wildest outlaw “emergency” powers—fully enforced. She bannedseeds, remember. And this mad reign has been imposed on what might be America’s most “backward” (normal) population.
She most purely embodiesthe vision.

        If history is any guide there are factions in the uniparty furiously trying to establish themselves as the replacement for the dementia joe admin. Probably the biggest bone of contention is who can be trusted to share the fruits of Operation Revenge for the Pale and distribute all the wealth laundered therein in a way everyone can agree on. Once there is a winner dj will die of covid related complications (if only he had that 17th booster, such a shame…) and the agreed upon puppet will be installed and they just have to turn off lights, pull down the shades and truck in the midnight deliveries from Pallets of Ballots, Ltd. and announce the new ‘President’ in the morning. Not sure the Republican Party will survive standing by as it plays out though. Its utility as a sham opposition should be entirely exhausted I would imagine. I assume the regime’s efforts to criminalize opposition will continue to escalate because its really the only option as every last ounce of legitimacy disappears.

        Z, the last time the media turned on a democrat was hillary in the 2008 primary to get Obama nominated .   there were several plots to kill jfk. there was a group arrested in chicago a month before dallas. rifles were confiscated. KFK’s trip top chicago to see the army -navy football game was cancled because of the plot.  I think there wa s one in tampa too. then there was on in dallas , and we all know how that ended .The “intellegence commuinty ” is not a one and done outfit. they will have backup plans .here is a great vidoeo about the chicago plot.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtQmv2YVdY. the channel has a lot of JFK info.I would like to know who picked the venue , that was a perfect spot for this kind of thing.Dealy plaza was a perfect “kill box” for an ambush, and a lot of shenanigans went on in the planning for the venue selection and rout planning went on to get the presidential limo  into it.

            I bet ear lapel pins and stickers would sell. I’m around little kids enough to know that stickers are still a thing and there are enough adults with smart ass tendencies- looking in the mirror—  to think that they could be an impulse buy and start showing up stuck to all kinds of things.    I for one would like to put one on every Biden/Harris sign I come across, though those are pretty rare where I live.

            Goshdam if my best friend didn’t just prove it.My beloved bestie, an arch anti-Trumper of the “dammit, so close!” kind, said he was ready to vote for Trump last night after the intro, so I watched it too.
He sent me this not a minute ago, after sleeping on it for a night:“Seems like bullshit. The crowd didn’t run. Shots fired and none ran for cover. Total BS. Nothing changes human nature. Something is not right here.”
This is right in line with all the righties yelling, “Dye patch!”
Even after seeing it on the holy TV!

The Middle East is riddled with unhinged conspiracy theories and the more we become like it the same will happen here. And like the Middle East, quite a few of the theories will be facts. Not this one, though, because…physics, among other things.

Or they killed a few bystanders to add verisimilitude.
All you need for a no-assassin conspiracy to work, is to have the shooter not fire anywhere near Trump, put ketchup on his ear when he’s buried in the SS scrum and fake a photo of a bullet flying by his head.

                        I would take a bet with you and give odds, Felix, because that would require:
I could believe, though, that this laid the groundwork for the next and successful attempt and the elevation of President Vance, as you wrote elsewhere. “Copycat, such an atmosphere of hate!” they laughed. As I wrote elsewhere, I’m “distrust and verify” with Vance, and no way in hell would I risk anything that involved more than four figures and/or a superficial scratch.

                            #1 is not an issue if the shooter aimed well clear of Trump.
#2 is a good point, but still not a showstopper. If you can believe Trump has the balls to stand up and pump fists right after a sniper missed him by less than an inch, surely you will allow him the courage to run such risk for the immense reward this incident has gained him.
As I said the other day, I don’t claim there’s no loose end in my theory, but the official stories have more of them than a tufted carpet.

                                Number 2 decides it for me. The reaction is believable, the trust a killshot would not be taken isn’t. That aside, everything we are being told is utter bullshit at this point and if everything changes in the next day or so it will not be counted against anyone other than those who actually placed bets.

Yes, it rather was, I’ll give you that. Lose end.
But none of the stories make sense, so I might as well stick with the colorful one.

                                Someone, on here I believe, remarked that bullet that killed Kennedy likely came from an accidentally misfired M16 from the lead vehicle, i.e. all the “fumbling around” for decades was trying to make sure the blithering incompetence of his security detail wasn’t revealed.  Much the same here more than likely.  The cops working their government make-work jobs couldn’t be bothered to coordinate with the SS DEI agents working their make-work jobs and a guy went right up a giant seem between the two (which wasn’t rocket science, it’s just were neither of them were).

                                    I do like the colorful “to add verisimilitude” part, but here is a comment from a career medico at CFN:
“Found it. It is Anna’s photo under Getty’s image, by Anna Moneymaker.Trump is down, his right hand has been wiped but has blood all over it, his face has not been wiped, blood tendrils running down it, the towel that is wiping is there.It is all there. before anyone has had a chance to do anything. Blood gel, my ass.”
Another points out the cowed local cops watching over that same rooftop from a 2nd story window.

                    It’s not unhinged to question something like an ear nick two days before a convention nobody would have otherwise watched. I go with probability and statistics. The probability of getting shot at and ending up with an ear nick has to be at lottery like levels. That’s why you can’t blame people like me who are skeptics.A lot of people don’t think the corpse they pulled out of that New York jail was that of Jeffrey Epstein. I’m suspicious about Ashley Babbitt’s killing. I’m suspicious about the cameras supposedly being off And then, of course, we have all those Clinton accidents and suicides.They can do anything they want and pull anything they want. I happen to think if it is being pulled, it’s a good lesson for everybody.

        Seems the plan was to remove him after a couple of years but Jill and Hunter said no. lol They don’t want Kamala to be put to the vote.
I swear, I used to think they weren’t paying for the lies and crimes against the citizens they have schemed, but they are paying more than we could ever know…you can see it in Anthony Blinken’s face. It’s bad.

        Somehow when you hear Blackrock you think Of Soros, or I do, when he was asked about his nazi past, he says if he didn’t do it someone else would have, and while absolutely true, this is not a way to operate and pretend you are just and the blessed of the world and represent progress. It’s on the side of evil and devolution.

        I will continue to read the Z-Man every weekday morning, but the quality of the comments has seemed to deteriorate over the years. I found the decisions of the SCOTUS recently, especially the chevron decision, to be most encouraging., thank you Donald Trump for your SCOTUS appointments.  But the commentators can’t seem to see any encouraging signs. What an inspired document was the U.S. Constitution and the bill of rights. Perfect? No. Buit close. A clause against involuntary servitude was missing, but hey, it was also missing from the tablet Moses came down the mountain with. Are there any optimist’s left commenting on the Z-man posts?

            Plenty of black pill junkies around here and more than a few pushers. That said, if you’ve read closely over the last few months you should have seen many of us noting that the Power Structure seems to be coming apart at the seams, and that this presents something of an opportunity for the sane and the decent to make inroads. That doesn’t make any of us Polyannas, but in these dark times you take your optimism where you can find it and in homeopathic dosages.

                Yes. There is quite a bit of purity spiraling here, which leads to black pills. Purity spiraling is our side’s equivalent of virtue signaling and it is hard to tell the two apart as far as the net effects. That written, there seems to have been an uptick in realistic optimism of late and it appears justified.

            The Articles of Confederation were working perfectly well. Why was it necessary for a group of oligarchs to gather secretly in Philadelphia to replace the existing governing document, and plan to seal the records for 50 years?

                Possibly the most important legislation passed by the US Congress, the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which allowed new states to enter the union as the full equals of existing states, was passed under the Articles of Confederation.  It was reenacted in 1789 by the first congress under the constitution.  The Articles of Confederation deserve more respect that they get historically.

            For me, the bottom line is a society and government that prioritizes whites and  a population that is overwhemling majority white. Theres a funny hesitancy I see to make this explicit even among the dr. If whites are under 85% of the population not only will things  go badly, but it will not properly be a society.
this multicultural nonsense is new and synthetic . So saying that it’s reality and we can’t do anything about isn’t just wrong, it’s evil.
so my black pill is that most whites don’t think this is true. But otherwise, I’m chipper!

        Trump understands that RFK could be in a position to play kingmaker on election day.  This is obvious.He also understands who could play kingmaker after election day.Trump understands — and who couldn’t, after everything that happened since 2015? — that election day is not respected by the Enemy or the traitors who service them.The unmistakeable sub and not-so-sub-text of Wednesday was a threat of violence if the will of the American people is not respected.  This was for the outerparty people.Thursday it was more of the same from the warm-up acts, but pitched to the proles: Real Americans get what they want or violence.And then Trump signalled directly to the military in one of those calculated remarks that he delivers in an offhand manner: the trouble is at the top.Is Clan Trump is bluffing here?

        This convention was competence on display. Very well done (especially considering the last minute changes) targeting normies and undecideds without hammering it.
As for the kid in a Blackrock ad B reel – that’s almost certainly from teachers playing stage mom for every leftwing cause/foundation on earth. Basically, functioning as willing casting directors for placing their young flock into “good citizen” class projects and activism.

        Damn, Zman called out all the men that are down with mixing races for a white man but not for a white woman. Whut? There is the fact that those men usually aren’t that interested in having kids to start with so get women who agree to handle 100% of taking care of the kids and hope the men take an interest in them.
