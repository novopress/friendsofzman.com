        Hey Z–welcome to the 1940s to 1960s.  The stuff that shocks you started at least then, if not earlier: (1) entrapment: no such thing in most jurisdictions, can’t explain here but trust me on this (2) snitches treated royally: old old old, (3) felony murder rule (unarmed bank robber who causes a shootout by police, police killing bystanders negligently, gets the robber charged with murder)–I think the first case was in the 1940s if not earlier.
Too many laws on the books, agreed.  But these laws are old news.
