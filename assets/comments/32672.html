        I was in a local library about two weeks ago. I overheard an elderly man — well, older man; I couldn’t see him yet — asking the librarian for a private space for a “meeting I want to have.” He had the voice of a confident still-somewhat healthy 70something. I heard her lead him to a table, which he didn’t like, and then to another, which he did. As they went from one table to the other, they passed by, and I saw and recognized him from my youth — well, my 20s.Local businessman, Izod Polo shirt, TopSiders, half-moon reading glasses, still-stylish white hair — wealthy, bored, early to mid 70s. Should have a folded-up copy of the WSJ under one arm. He’s got a bunch of papers with tiny yellow Post-It notes on various parts of them. Clearly, in charge of the paperwork.He explains in boring and loud detail how he’s meeting an “ECUADORIAN” to place him in a local home. Young female librarian looks at this guy, Wasp Terwilliger IV, and says, “do you have a translator?” and he says, “no, I just ask him English questions and determine his proficiency. Then I match him with someone in the area who has a little, some, or a lot of proficiency in Spanish.” I guess it works. Who knows.Then I look this guy over more carefully and remember him from my youth. Used to be a local business guy, real hardass. Engineering firm. Used high school kids during the summers as interns to do surveying scut work. Paid nothing. Ever. Recommendations? Forget it. Drove some of my friends up a wall trying to get jobs with him during college summers — he thought he was Lee Iacocca. Did nothing for anybody, thought his job in life was to break people apart to show his superiority.Now I look at him and he’s spending his sunset years bringing in illegals and putting them in rural and suburban homes without — I gather — the knowledge of neighbors. I remember the way he spoke to my friends trying to get started in life in the US and the obstacles people like him put in their way because “muh capitalism” or some other story he told himself to justify his selfishness. And now this, as a parting shot as he heads out the door.And I get pretty damn mad, man. Pretty damn mad.

            A read hard-case to his fellow whites trying to make it in America, and an enabler of the erasure of those self-same whites. He sounds like a real cutie-pie, alright. Poetic justice would be that Ecuadorean introducing Terwilliger to his maker.

            Sadly, Churchians just like that come in all ages. I joke about it being a mind-virus, but it sure acts like one. Once some denomination (any, really, but very prominent in Jewish. Lutheran, Methodist, Catholic, (including Eastern), Anglican, Pentecostal, etc., and maybe especially atheist) get that asylum bone in their maw, they can’t let it go.
The only partial solution is for the uninfected to self quarantine into various traditional subsects. The final solution is probably going to take some cleansing fire or something.

                It would appear that what many of them found most appealing in the gospels was Jesus’s forgiveness of his tormentors and executioners.  They find something very masochistically stimulating about it.  Thus, they seek out fights to lose so that they may be noble in defeat.  With regards to immigrants, it’s penance for belonging to a superior race.  They can’t stop from making amends.

                    This is one of the reasons I keep butting heads with one of the priests in our parish. My old army boss is a Messianic Jew and has nothing but contempt for the antics of the tribe. He and I were having a conversation once about the whole “turning the other cheek” bit and he said a few things that made sense. His explanation of “turn the other cheek” was that it was Jesus’ way of telling the apostles “Don’t let the enemy get in your head.” if you allow yourself to be mentally pushed around by everything you hear, you’ll never have focus.He then went on to add that it is no sin to strike someone who really needs it. He elaborated by saying that if you and I are getting coffee someplace and some scumbag decides to attempt to rape a female patron, we are not going to stand there and say, “Well, we’ll pray for that poor soul and hope he has a change of heart, no, we’ll kick the ever loving shit out of him and leave his sorry ass for the cops to deal with.” He said, “I don’t pretend to know what’s in Jesus’ mind, but I’m pretty sure that he’ll frown on not coming to the aid of that young lady, hiding behind something we thought he meant as an excuse.”Likewise whenever this priest goes into his “We need to pray for the souls of all of these criminals and hope they see the light.” I cringe. I once told him, “I have children and you don’t. I’d much rather see them safe and permanently remove the filthy hordes that have waltzed in here and to incur the Almighty’s wrath for doing so, than to see anything happen to them just so people like you can say that I was a “good Christian.”He bristled and said something along the lines of, “No, you cannot have that attitude, it’s wrong. God will protect your children regardless.” I retorted with, “No father, you don’t play the game, so you don’t get to lecture me about the rules.”My priest from the early 90’s would not only have had no problem with our attitudes here, but what have supported the point I made above.

                        I’m an ex-Episcopal priest, now Catholic. I like your Army friend’s take on it– makes me want to go back to the Church Fathers’ commentaries for a refresher. I get the sense that most of the younger priests are more traditional and have a better sense of the real world than many Catholic priests of my own Boomer generation. They trend manlier as well.Good for you for speaking to the priest about it; I know I appreciated hearing from parishioners about how they took my homilies and I got my perspective challenged/straightened out more than once. (don’t we all have some blind spots?) I spent several decades as a celibate before finally realizing I wasn’t going to be Saint Francis of Assisi and being a parent definitely changed my take on things. I had been a good teacher, uncle, Big Brother, school and orphanage chaplain, but being “Dad” gives insight that doesn’t come naturally to celibate “Father”.I would die fighting to protect my daughters and I am sure any Christian father would if the need arose. If I had enough left in me, I would execute a man that assaulted my sister, niece or daughter– especially my daughter. Then, I would go to confession. If the state would condemn me, or any man, for defending his family, then so be it.

                        A proper translation for Matthew 5:39 is “Do not have enmity for an evil person.”Matthew 5:39-41 is highly contextual. A master would show displeasure and contempt for their servants by using their right hand to backhand the servant on the “right cheek”. If the servant turns the left cheek to their master, the master would have to use their left hand for a backhand strike which would be unclean and exposes the action as unclean. The Romans had a law that allowed their soldiers to force the subjects of the empire to carry their gear for a mile. For the subject to carry a load for two miles would imply that the Roman soldier commanded something unlawful which implies that the law itself is unlawful. I have not researched the third example yet, but if someone sued for your shirt, I expect that giving them your coat would leave you naked to some degree and bring shame upon the community, thus exposing the shamefulness of suing someone for everything they own.What Jesus was teaching here were ways for servants to expose the shamefulness of their masters from the position of a servant where Christ did so from the position of higher authority (“hypocrites”, “whitewashed tombs”, and clearing the temple with a whip).It follows that these verses would be used to expose the shamefulness of modern Christian institutions. A modern layman would not be expected to understand the teaching correctly, but a supposed teacher with a proper education should. It reveals the institutional corruption and incompetence when they do not. The fail-safe in both cases is the guidance of the Holy Spirit which is still operational given how many have a deep and instinctive negative reaction to the doctrine of pacifism attached to these verses. The full shamefulness being exposed is how the professional class has rejected that guidance for other gods.God has never been a pacifist and has never commanded humans to be pacifists either. Basic consistency should not be hard.Verse 42 on borrowing is possibly playing on the reaction of treating the supplicant like an evil person or the hard “eye for an eye” expectation of repayment in full, and juxtaposes yourself with the previous examples of shameful authority.

                    A Christian Conservative friend told me he wouldn’t do anything to stop third world invaders from attacking him physically.  He’s a big guy, 6-4, black belt in karate, and he actually said that. (makes one wonder why he put in the time and effort to get the black belt…)His reasoning is that he would follow the lead of Jesus.  He said when they crucified Jesus he had the power to, for example, make a lightning bolt and strike his enemies to free himself, but chose not to.When I asked him if he would protect his wife and daughters from the invaders he stumbled and couldn’t give me an answer.

                            That’s a great question.  He has told me numerous times he prefers black Christians to White non-Christians.  So I guess he’d rather live in Christian Nigeria over Japan.

                        “When I asked him if he would protect his wife and daughters from the invaders he stumbled and couldn’t give me an answer.”This is why I’ve pretty much stopped speaking with these type of people—they have an infantile understanding of scripture, and especially the OT.Here’s a part of the Bible he seems to have overlooked. Specifically from Leviticus 19:16, which says:“Do not stand by idly when your neighbor’s life is at stake” or, in some translations, “You shall not stand idly by the blood of your neighbor.”This commandment is part of the broader moral and ethical teachings, emphasizing the duty to protect and aid others in times of danger or distress. It is understood as a directive to intervene when someone’s life (your life as well) is at risk and not to remain passive in the face of harm or injustice.This commandment is interpreted as an obligation to prevent harm or danger to others when it is within one’s power to do so, reflecting a commitment to justice and the sanctity of life.

            I noticed a thing with older people I knew (friends’ parents) about 10 years ago…they seemed to grow a lefty conscience, where before (when I knew them as middle-aged people) they were normal, suburban center-right people. Suddenly they got all misty about civil rights and immigrants.
Of course, as Trump got elected and Covid blew through, they did all the predictable posturings. Now they’re Kamala voters.

                I think many olds–especially women–were guilted into atonement for their racism in early life. Atonement came in the form of being super, extra-nice to negroes they encountered, and perhaps even voting Dem occasionally. I call it the Oprah Effect.

                You are close Nick.  Jump up a few thousand feet and redo your observation.  Race mixing is the root of all political turmoil.  Our influx of “immigrants” have been of mixed, but non-root stock (White), since the late 1960’s.  If we’d have keep them European, we’d not be here today.  This observation/theory also has a corollary: even when the primary race (White) is gone, the turmoil will continue.

                The problem is, so many “communities” no longer exist.  Many of them got replaced by “abstract communities” based on thinking and not proximity.  People now live in zip codes and not actual communities.  Every single year more than 2% of all “Americans” make an interstate move and never stay very long.  Everyone is from somewhere else and plans on moving at the first opportunity.  You cannot build a community with a bunch of strangers who don’t plan on staying anyway.

            We’ve got those infesting every level of money and power in my town, Ashland, Kentucky. They’ve allowed all sorts of tramps to be transported right here, where they adorn every street corner begging, camping out in the woods here in town, and they love to live in the basements of empty houses.There’s also an art gallery on Winchester Avenue where they love to go, as well as the Highlands Museum. These are Democrat institutions, for they’ve already had the chicks with d!cks putting on their shows, and reading to their children as well. The attendance to either has massively dropped off for both since those clown shows, but they don’t care.The people here already hate them, and I look forward to a time where hopefully in the future they all leave or suddenly disappear, and all at once. I never see or hear anything, lol.

            I seem to recall a character in one of Dickens’ novels who had zero compassion for the downtrodden in her native Britain  but when it came to the destitute and deprived of foreign lands (the more foreign, the better) she was all too willing to contribute her time and money.

                The Duchess of Sutherland had a similar attitude with regards to negroes. When Harriet Beecher Stowe read her excerpts from “Uncle Tom’s Cabin”, she reportedly was in tears and asked how she could help them. Contrast that with the fact that the Duchess had hundreds of dirt-poor Scots – including a large number of children – residing on her lands who were starving and she couldn’t have cared less about them.

            Look at the story about the Haitians in Ohio. The factory owner came out and said that he prefers Haitians because they “show up on time and aren’t on drugs.” Of course Richard Hanania, desperate to get approval from the ruling elite, blasted this out. But look, this is how it is. These old relatively wealthy local scions are not our friends. They don’t like White people any more than the bureaucrats running these operations in DC do. They want Whites gone just as much as anyone working for Mayorkas. He gets cheap labor, treats them like crap, and relies on the government to pay the difference. This arrangement benefits him, and he almost certainly supports the Republican Party.The question of why the locals are on drugs, and what he could do to help his own people, in his own town, to make it better, never crosses his mind. Say what you will about wealthy blacks, they at least put on a show about helping “their community.” These Whites don’t even do that.

                Traitorous business owners like that sleazy Springfield factory owner get cheap compliant workers who will quietly accept rock bottom wages and lousy working conditions.  The Wokies get plenty of welfare clients to shower money on and virtue signal to each other about.  The Democratic machine gets a new cheap voter base that’s less demanding than blacks.  Unlimited mass immigration is the lifeblood of the Left today.

                    Absolutely, and this is what people need to realize. We have so much of it because it is mutually beneficial to both sides. The negative externalities get pushed on to us. You can blame the juice, you can blame the liberals, you can blame Nancy Pelosi, you can blame “Catholic” Charities, you can blame Mayorkas, you can blame whatever, but this would not be happening if the Republicans and “elite” Whites who run both large and small companies did not want it as well. On this issue and many others, their job is to lie to your face while making sure they have your support so they can keep this operation going. And when people start seeing through the lies, they just go full mask-off and reveal their contempt for their own people.

                        The Jews who run Catholic Charities were hired by Christians to do exactly what they’re doing. You buy a doberman to scare burglars, a beagle to find a body, or a pit bull to eat your baby.The Church’s mission—Christendom’smission—is to End Whiteness. Jews show a unique eagerness to see it accomplished. So let them.Reminds me of a story from somewhere.But never mind stories. They’re justbetter workers, like the Springfield Haitians, the Aztecs on your roof, or the Pakis turning out the daughters of England. You’re too lazy, drugged, andemotionalto show up on time and take care of business. Four out of five jobcreatorsagree. Our creators.

                To be fair, do you know how many whites I have to go through to get a goodwhite on the payroll? They are generally good at showing up on time, but (a reflection of our times) way too often can’t pass the insurance-mandated random drug test, or they show up hung over on way too many Mondays. There are only so many things to do if I can’t let him on the forklift or run the machinery until the afternoon.
The ones I can hire without even an interview are the ones whose dads I know.

                    In the 2000s, hundreds of thousands of young White men and women died from drug overdose. This was before they could start families, work, be productive. Ohio was the epicenter of this problem, and nobody in government lifted a finger. So now, 10-20 years later, they’re just importing 70 IQ Haitians to do the work those dead Whites would have done, insulting Whites as they do it, and taking glee in doing so (like Hanania).I know you need employees and I get it, but this is a societal problem that isn’t being addressed because the ruling class hates us and wants us dead.

                        Oh, definitely! I suspect it goes back quite a bit further, at least to the nose candy of the ’80s. And likely back into the ’60s, so “the man” had an excuse to bring in foreigners.
By the mid ’90s, it was a challenge to find line workers who would stay clean long enough for the THC to clear. Despair and escape is not just a Zoomer thing.

                        The economists have a term/description for this phenomenon.
They say what we are seeing is an externalization of costs and an internalization of benefits.
Of course, the broken White workforce was created due to government incentives first created by NAFTA.  Our industries were incentivized to move overseas to obtain low cost workforce, while the owners kept the profits in their pockets and the White community declined into poverty and despair (externalization).
Now we import those workers to these shores and externalize the cost (now on steroids) while again internalizing the benefit.  No other “non-Western” country does this.

                Part of the problem in Ohio is the Governor, the repellent Mike DeWine.  He’s done “mission” trips to Haiti and has no issue with importing a bunch Caribbean peasants into an already struggling small town.  He’s a brain dead hack and should be stuffed in a bottle and dropped into the Cuyahoga River.

                    There are any number of studies showing 1st generation immigrants to be relatively good workers and potential citizens.  I’ve always chalked that up to a recent memory or how bad the situation they came from was, a fear of being sent back, and a bit of selection bias.These studies however show an excessive welfare use, extending even onto the second generation.  There seems to be less study of how those born in the USA of such parents fare.  I suspect not so good.My concern is that importing such people simply creates societal costs, which are then apportioned to the rest of us, while the benefits accrue to a very few.

            For your next piece may I suggest you research more about today’s ESL teaching methodologies (hint: the learners’ first language is not ordinarily used)? And while probably not a needed plot device, I’m having difficulty understanding how your setting would have people with a range of proficiencies in Spanish. I could imagine there being fluent speakers of Spanish, Tagalog, Hindi, or what have you in a given American locale, but the typical native-born resident would not speak a word of any of them. In fact, I find myself questioning your basic premise, since “can’t speak English,” while a bugaboo for the nativists among us, would seem to represent a distinct advantage for your exploitative antagonist. Speaking of whom, this character may be overly similar to one from a Dickens novel. You might want to flesh the fellow out a bit to make him believable.

            People like this make me so very hopeful for a miracle to happen in the form of a cataclysmic event where things go so out of control that the law effectively ends.

People like him, the NGOs, politicians et al, their precious savages &amp; the police all have a symbiotic relationship &amp; collectively work together to ensure civilization is destroyed &amp; in the process harm innocent people all without consequence while simultaneously forcing us all to fund it at gunpoint.That this occurs whilst they all act holier than thou is just icing on the cake.

            Yep. We olds tried and failed to come up with something to oppose the progs. It’s high time for the whippersnappers to come up with a replacement. At least before they end up in the nursing homes, too. We can’t do everything for you your whole lives.
I mean, crap, the best idea they’ve come up with so far is ConInc 2.0, now with Charlie Kirk and extra BoomerHate.

                    Don’t personally know your generation, or indeed, anyone like you, then. No idea how I got lumped into it. I wasn’t actually, until after college and they moved the line from 1962 to 1964.
But FFS, get off your fucking knees and do something about it. Don’t be like those worthless congresscritters (mostly Boomers led by Silents) taking a knee for BLM.
At the very least, you ran your own business and hired exclusively whites, right?

                Gotta get over the Nazi business, quit letting Hitler be a stumbling block. It’s about identity. Conservatives don’t conserve, because they’re afraid to open the door to who they are. Lefty thinks Hitler is hiding in the shadows, Righty thinks he’s within. So conservatives settle for money and ideology— and lose.

                    “Righty thinks he’s within.”
Likely because education is really indoctrination. One either has to be horribly propagandized or a complete retard to think the Fake and Gay GAE has much in common with Hitler. Sure there’s the nationalization of the assets of the dissenters, lawfare, stupid economic ideas like protectionism, but that’s not the core of Hitler’s programme. It was probably Hitler’s take on protectionism that made his prewar buildup much worse than it would have been, and limited the length of war he could have.

            Well said. post-America was and is an imperial project. It is aimed at creating a global mercantile imperium. It will be controlled militarily by full spectrum dominance on the seas with a master control in space. It will be controlled ideologically through full spectrum information control. It will be controlled regionally through racial patronage networks and switching between anarcho-tyranny and harsh repression as the situation dictates.Conservatives were there to pretend defend America and its natos. The frog has boiled. Now we go our own way. Should opportunity arise once we are strong enough to ally and bargain with real players in the system, we can take a seat at the table again. Should we secure that we proceed with flipping it if that is the only way we get back to the head of it.The days of just wanting to be left alone are gone. We bend our will on being the dominant power or we fade away into oblivion. It is in our hands.

                I can’t think of an empire that wasn’t good for business. Even the USSR made some men stupid rich, even if their assets were technically state-owned. You can abolish private property, but it doesn’t seem like you can abolish trade or traders.
I’d go so far to guess empire is about business, at the end of the day. Another reason I’m a civ skeptic.

                    You can’t even abolish private property. You can abolish titles, sure, but State ownership of property does not eliminate private property, it just means that it is the private property of those who manage it.
If the Capitol is really public property, what justification can one make for prosecuting the public for “parading” through it?

Internationally, US was pretty much irrelevant until at least Teddy Roosevelt, by which time England had become the Empire on Whom the Sun Never Sets or whatever it was called.

                        The question is, is AINO the ineluctible result of America, or was it possible to make different decisions that would have preserved America and obviated AINO? If the latter, America was worth creating and preserving. If not, then it was misbegotten from the word go. I believe America was great, but a few terrible decisions/policies destroyed it.

                            Surfguy and Compsci pointed out in yesterday’s post that the Brits were building Confederate ships in their yards. A friend of mine, who I trust on these matters, told me Lee was being advised by British generals at Gettysburg. So the Brits were supporting the South, because it was in their interest to break up the US, and the South’s interest was to maintain their profitable trade with the UK. Cheap cotton for British textiles, and such.I’m not rah-rah Lincoln, but I do think he had the right idea about preserving the Union.It was a terrible situation that unleashed all sorts of evils. In the end, the US bought itself some time. But here we are, the new seat of the ‘British’ Empire, names changed so people don’t pick up on it. They won, in the end, and our revolution failed. Securing the blessings of liberty for our posterity became Democracy! and all the other smokescreens for another colonial project.PS I put ‘British’ in quotes because I don’t blame the English.

            I’m in a local “conservative” meetup group. We don’t do anything useful. We sit at our table in the diner and whine about the Left. There’s another similar group that I just can’t bear to join because of its name. It’s “Friends of Abe”. Jeebus. Still, it’s good to hear about people like you freeing themselves from the mind-rot.

                “Pity parties” never are useful—which is why I avoid them.  Yeah, some such discussion is socially useful, like small talk about the recent weather, but that should take only a few minutes.  At that point I’m a pretty silent figure in these groups.

        Candace Owens gets away with what she says because she’s a black married to a White Brit (with some seriously fugly offspring) and thus personifies normie’s aspirational color blindness and melting-pot pabulum.  That’s the basis of any ‘moral standing’ she may have.  She is ultimately another gatekeeper, the very embodiment of White replacement.

        After Mass on Tuesday, I stayed for lunch and I was talking to the people at my end of the table, it is an extremely conservative parish, tlm,  age range was early gen-x late Boomer and the slightly off daughter of one of them. When we realize September 11th was the next day we did the obligatory where were you when and then the daughter asked “so do we know what happened?”  and no joke all four of us just shrugged our shoulders, it was so spontaneous it was almost funny. Narrative collapse is real,  these people would have all been Patriots, we all bought into it at one point and now we we can’t say for sure what happened though we do acknowledge people died, that’s about it.

            I was DoD at the time, as were most most of my friends, some as contractors. ALL of us got warnings about Israeli ‘art students’. It is crystal clear with 100% certainty based on the MASSIVE Israeli espionage operation (1) inside FUSA that one of two things is true: either the Israelis knew about the impending attack and told no one or the Israelis knew about the attack and forewarned our government who then chose to do nothing. Either is plausible.(1) Also recall the numerous Israeli ‘moving van’ companies. A whole bunch of those operations were rolled up, then swiftly deported back to Israel. I recall one strange incident. I think it was about two years after the bulk of the moving van Israeli deportations. A moving van full of Israelis tried to bluff their way through the front gate of the King’s Bay naval base in Georgia, where Atlantic SSBN’s are stationed. They were swiftly deported. The story only appeared in a local newspaper, as far as I could tell. The online version eventually vanished. It’s like they were hiding out waiting to be activated, then got a recall order: “just get yourselves arrested, the stupid goyish Americans will pay for your flight home.”

        The Regime thinks everything is a TV show, so I remember The West Wing had a token conservative character. He was the gentle wrongthink memorial to the enlightened center-left government. He merely reminded the Bartlett administration that conservatives exist, somewhere, and could be kept around, in small numbers of course, like that funky old TV stand that your mother gave you when you got your first house but it doesn’t match any of your decor, but you can’t bring yourself to throw it away. It doesn’t match anything, but it does remind you when your mother was a comfy presence and not a demented old fart.That’s what conservative inc., at best, means to the Regime.

            I never watched it, but that show did a lot of damage.  It convinced a generation of young lefties that is what the political process should look like.  Not that good things were happening before it, but it made the whole process less serious and accelerated decline.

        In the mid 1990s, there was a brief wellspring of genuine civic duty in the Republican party, manifested in the “republican revolution” of 1994, effected by Reagan Republicans who actually believed in what they were pushing. This is why, to this day, many on both the left and right still refer to Bill Clinton as “center right” or even as conservative. He was never any such thing, but this GOP congressional majority forced him in that direction, and like the good politician he is, he took credit for the popular things that they forced him to do. This dynamic lasted for 2 or 3 years before those earnest Republicans became, like everyone who goes there, corrupted by DC. I think this was the last time that Con Inc. embodied any genuine, non cynical conservative ideals. The ensuing Bush admin being just a globohomo trojan horse masquerading as conservatism. Anyone who tells you Dubya wasn’t a good politician, I must differ, he managed to convince millions of  Middle Americans that he gave a damn about them when that wasn’t even remotely true.Speaking of Clinton and the Bushes and conservatism, I have a hard time coming up with ammo to refute the idea that Ross Perot ran for president, first in 92 and again in 96, only to split the conservative vote and get and keep Clinton in the WH. To this day, people argue about who he took votes from in 92, but in 96 I don’t think it’s up for debate.  I submit that, absent his candidacy, the same “republican revolution” that gained Congress in 94 would have forced Clinton out in 96. In favor of Dole, who incidentally was about the only prominent pol of the ‘old guard’ who publicly endorsed Trump in 2020. Perot of course being born and raised in Texarkana, just a short ride down the road from Hope.

                It seems to me that those shutdowns demonstrated that few voters were willing to shut down the government for the sake of fiscal responsibility. They really didn’t mind unlimited borrowing against their children’s futures.
A different population of voters might have chosen to let the government close. I wonder if the country had kept its original standards for who could vote if the result would have been different.

            I think it’s past time toretire the trope that ‘good people’ are “corrupted” by DC.  No such thing as magic or tragic dirt.  They are corrupt people to start with who are further and willingly corrupted by electoral and party politics long before they get to Sodom on the Potomac.  That’s the only type of people the system selects for.

                A slight variation/elaboration on your perfectly sensible comment.  I believe we have a percentage of the population who are *born* “sociopaths”.  This mental disorder has been estimated as high as 5% of the population.  Those folks are attracted to such endeavors as politics and other large institutional control.

            Perot took my vote from Bush and Pat Buchanan was freely given it. He (Buchanan) lost and I decided to expatriate once again, but for the last time. I was gone in ’98 and have stayed gone. The rural outpost to which I retreated is now growing by leaps and bounds: urban retirees and remittance men (and women), in some cases trust fund hippies with kids named Anubis and Kali who go to the Waldorf school. The upside is they all need water wells, so my son, who has a water well drilling biz, has a 12 client backlog, oil company clients and now perhaps some mining contracts as well. I sit in my front porch rocker rubbing my hands together with glee. Woner when the firstyanquiswill appear here.

                I’ve no doubt he was, but that picture is a little overrated in memeland. The presence of Lisa Taylor Wallace (George’s 3rd wife) on the right indicates it was taken while Clinton, who looks young, was already governor (which he became at 32). It’s hardly unusual for a governor to be hobnobbing with that crowd.

            That was brilliant by Trump, by the way. I was asking all the people mocking Trump if they have been paying attention the last 8 years. Trump always throws out something that sounds ridiculous and maybe was exaggerated. Mainstream sources pick him apart and mock him, and slowly but surely we find out that Trump was on to something. Same pattern repeats over and over.

        In other words, the point was not to provide an alternative history or answer reasonable questions about important events of the official narrative, but to legitimize questioning of it.Excellent point and you have identified the actual reason behind the silly panic. The genie is out.A prominent blogger today linked a very recent Foreign Affairs article that calls for modified internationalism that is repackaged as semi-isolationism. As the blogger noted, the main goal of the article is to tell people what to think in a new way that still maintains imperial control. After the squalling and squealing subsides over the World War II revisionism/revisit, expect something similar to the Foreign Affairs piece–a modified limited hangout that concedes mistakes have been made in the record. A current example of this sort of rewrite is the revised claim that while Haitians do indeed eat Fluffy and FiFi, they are far less prone to criminality than native Americans, so, win. Good luck with that. Even Karen doesn’t want her cat eaten.The availability of widespread information presents a fatal problem for policymakers, court historians, and all other elements of the Regime. Despite breathless efforts to censor, the truth is extremely hard if not impossible to contain now. The two foundational myths of the GAE are the Civil War and World War II, and since neither withstand much scrutiny, attempts will be made to suppress discussion of them. That will fail, too.

                The correct narrative and solution:  The economically/nutritionally at risk migrants need increased EBT and then they will be able to access the same prepared foods as the privileged white people, provided they don’t live in a food desert.  Better fund an NGO to “address” that.  NPR, please send me a payment, or at least a tote bag, for my idea.

                Some have hoped that liberal women will turn against massive immigration if it puts their beloved cats at risk. I hope so, but remember that strident feminism suddenly became submissive when the topic turned to black males and their treatment of women. Suddenly these outspoken feminists became meek and quiet, except to blame white supremacy.
When black people eat their cats, will they somehow blame white men?  (I bet my sister would.)

                    Yep. The same women and feminized men who rail against “Climate “Change” go silent when it is pointed out that mass migration makes it worse if the theory is correct. Better to melt under a scorching sun than to be seen as racist, of course.

                                Brave’s search is so censored (or corrupted by being Google-trained or whatever) that it can’t even find Bible quotes. It started very well, then, like all accessible search tools, it had itsone day.
And have a look at the company’s executive bio gallery. Bring eye protection. This is what Our Democracy looks like.Nudge.
So don’t use Brave if you’re doing anything interesting.

                                    Truth. Find a search engine that matches the kinds of things you typically search for.
Though I do find Brave adequate for Bible verses. It’s just a matter of knowing enough of the verse in ESV or NIV for it to end up on the front page. If you know the KJV well enough that you don’t need to look it up in the first place, it’s often the #1 or #2 hit.

        Current American conservatism is just the liberalism of thirty years ago. America is a liberal country founded on liberal philosophical assumptions. The liberals always have the high ground and the “conservatives” know it. If you oppose liberalism, you are philosophically anti-American. Such knowledge is demoralizing for those who consider themselves patriotic (conservatives) and hinders their ability to oppose their more liberal political enemies. Each liberal victory is quickly rationalized as really being conservative after all (e.g., civil rights, gay rights, abortion, and the whole sodomitic agenda).

        “but to open the conversation about the official narrative”God, please!  Next sacred cow that has to be scrutinized is immigration.  For so long it’s part of the BS “melting pot” narrative and all the old-timers think it’s the same as the early 20th Century Great Waves of Italians, Irish, and Jews.  (which wasn’t so idyllic at the time, BTW).But it needs to be start be called outright as the replacement and terrorism that it is and was.  Nothing to do with giving “hopeful newcomers” a better life; it’s about giving YOU a worse life.  Cheap labor, cheap votes, welfare dependency, and a standing army of CANNIBALS to terrorize you.No more ceding rhetorical ground on this existential issue.

        This article has been written thousands of times, word for word, just swap out Candance Owens and Nick Fuentes for whoever was the villain of the moment at the time. They don’t realize that nobody cares anymore. They blew up their operation after October 7th, when they kept spouting obvious falsehoods (about the decapitated babies, for example) about stuff that just happened, leading to people wondering what else are they lying about. It’s over. And even if every thing they have ever said and written is true, how does that give them license to commit genocide in Gaza? Why are they the only ones that have the unfettered right to kill women and children as they please? And since we have the internet, this leads people down a path to learn about what theyreallythink about themselves and the go… I mean, the Gentiles.We just saw how the cons teamed up with the liberals to try to shape the narrative about the debate. The current narrative is that OBVIOUSLY Orange Man lost but Kamala didn’t get a bump in the polls and trust for Trump on key measures like immigration and economy went up. This narrative doesn’t even make any sense! They’re not even trying to make sense anymore! These people have a problem, and they can’t clamp down and censor like they did 5 years ago.

            My wife still listens to the the partially animated corpse of Mark Steyn, who’s lost as much IQ to age and illness as Biden has (but from a far higher starting point). On his show this week when listeners asked about the Cooper/Tucker OUTRAGE, he began his commentary very weirdly, saying this is “all about Gaza.” After admitting he didn’t hear the show and knew nothing about it, he darkly wondered why Tucker didn’t interrupt Cooper’s antisemitic tirade, and alleged but never explained that this newthinking ill of Churchillthing happening on the right endangerseverything(just like Derb said). He never really got back to what it was “all about.”Basically, Steyn’s not having heard of Cooper before was decisive: He’s nobody and (therefore) hates Jews. Anyone with a few tweets’ familiarity with Cooper knows he’sabjecton the subject—amanly tearsraconteur of Jews’ innocent victimhood (endless), angry excuser of their crimes in Russia and environs, etc. Anyone who’s read even a somewhat fair summary of the Tucker interview knows they weren’t talking about Jews or the Holocaust or analogizing anything to “Gaza” (as partisans have taken to describing the whole 10/7-to-presentthing).I think Steyn’s point was yours, accidentally. With “Gaza,” official lies became too blatant. This opened a space for, e.g., Candace Owens (he mentioned her in his ramble) to dump a bunch of JQ-for-dummies into. Tucker, prior to the Cooper thing, had shown signs of contamination by the far right’s openness to revision (general)—a miasmal poison that’s now dizzying the right! Perhaps he’s gone mad! If the post-war order is in any way demythologized, itmust collapse!!That’s exactly what the left wants!!! Hating Churchill istheirs!!! Etc.It doesn’t quite fit together, as conservative things don’t, but the logic is familiar: There are lies we must believe. They’re the ones with Jews in them. Even when that’s not what we’re talking about, we can’t talk about it. This axiom—our agreement never to seek the truth of the post-war order’s founding—iscivilization. “Gaza” endangers it. Whatever endangers it is “Gaza.”

                There are lies we must believe.You nailed it there with that tremendous insight.It is also a necessary pivot since truth is so much harder to contain these days. We absolutely are no different (save our wealth, tenuous as it is) than those who lived in the final years of Ceausescu, going along with the lies incrementally more slowly as our lives diminish. Marx got much right, but the real opiate of the masses always has been and remains materialism. The choice now as then is either publicly profess belief in the lies or be harshly punished. As long as those lives are prosperous, the choice is easy, but the day will come when thesarmaleis insufficient to make us proclaim that, yes, Elena was the most brilliant medical researcher of all time.Victorie.

                Steyn lost me over 15 years ago when his predictions of Islamic numbers and Islamic birth rates turned out to be bogus. He was one of those people who claimed that Muslims in the middle-east and Muslims in Europe had a fertility rate of 5 to 6 kids. In reality, most middle-eastern countries have fertility rates around 2 and some of them (Turkey and Iran) rates comparable to European white people. Recent Muslim immigrant have fertility rates around 2, then drop to the European white average within 10 years of arrival. I posted all of this on Razib Khan’s blog back in the day (remember him?) and he agreed with me that Steyn played fast and loose with his stats. I have never paid a lick of attention to Steyn since then. I have not even heard about him in years, until today.

                    Perhaps a bit of clarity is in order.  TFR includes live births, but takes no account of deaths after birth.  So one could look at third world births and predict high TFR and see lower total population increase due to deaths after birth.  We had a similar situation in the USA 100+ year ago.  Likewise, we’d expect a lower TFR for 3rd world immigrants once they figure out, they don’t need 5 children to have 2 survive into adulthood.

        The Republican party really hasn’t had a reason to exist since 1876, when they finally gave up on military occupation and “Reconstruction” of the Confederacy. Ever since then, they have been ideologues in search of an ideology, but not having the stones to be truly counterrevolutionary in over a century, much preferring to be obedient lapdogs.

        The guy who wrote that piece on Candace Owens says that there were no dancing Israelis. I clearly remember that there were dancing Israelis. I remember following that little drama with keen interest. It’s all been memory-holed now so the anaesthetized masses are ignorant of it at this point since a full generation has passed since the event, but it was prominent in the news cycle at the time.Candace Owens was right about that one but — and I didn’t come up with this but it makes sense — Candace Owens is allowed to continue posting on social media because she discredits the dissident right with the many other wacko theories she promotes. IOW, the CO phenomenon, like so many others, is a project of the Washington intelligence/surveillance apparatus. Jared Taylor has been permanently banned from X/Twitter but Candace Owens has free rein. That tells you all you need to know.But you know what, it doesn’t matter. Truth is going to be in such short supply as the institutions continue their assault on the First amendment that people will be ready to believe anything. It has rapidly morphed into a quest for naked power and that’s all that will matter as the populace polarizes further. All trust has been destroyed. There’s no room for second-order thinking at this point and that explains the shift to approval for long-range missile to Ukraine, to take another example. We are rapidly approaching the end game, regardless of how long it takes for the boomers to empty out of the nursing homes.

He is a bit of an acquired taste and he may strike people of the lead singer from Red Hot Chili Peppers in both look and persona, but he is excellent in terms of his research into 9/11.  He talks of how the dancing Israelis were actually arrested so there is a paper trail and public records that shysters cannot then say these dancing Israelis never existed.

                Thanks, I’ll check him out. Yes, they were arrested and it was widely reported. Then Israel worked their diplomatic connections to get them hustled out of the country before they could be questioned. They even triumphantly appeared on Israeli television after they were deported. They were taping the attack as it happened. Why were they dancing? It was because they knew it was going to send their golem into a rage over the “terrurists” and get us into war in the Middle East. And the rest is history.Ironically Bush the Dumber put Muslim immigration into hyperdrive after that because… we can’t blame the Muslims. Yesh, (rubbing hands), he was actually speaking a greater truth than he realized. There’s nothing some people love more than to pit “friend” against foe. “To the last Ukrainian,” as they say. We don’t have definitive proof that the Dancing Israelis themselves had advance knowledge of the attack, but Tower III stands (or rather, no longer stands) as a reminder that something wasn’t right in Gotham that day.

                    I meant to say Tower 7.Obviously, it was touch-and-go for the usual suspects as they had to scramble to fortify the narrative as it evolved. But Tower 7 is irrefutable proof that the riggers rigged more than a narrative. The problem for the narrative riggers is alternative media. That genie can never be put back in the bottle, try as hard as they may. Ordinary people today don’t see Israel as the little underdog they once did, for example, in the times when the only alternative narratives were delivered by snail-mail in brown parcels, so you had to be really committed to learn forbidden truths.

        Rome depended on fairly massive, and well organized military force (the legions were basically a walled shield army as a giant stabbing machine); and internal cohesion balancing competing factions, interests, and classes. When both broke down the first opportunistic threats would bring them down, which did happen eventually when the barbarians both grew in number and adopted much of Roman military organization, meanwhile having greater internal cohesion. It is interesting that unlike our age, Rome’s had little to none of “ideology” to fuel internal conflict.The US depended on a massive industrial base, with little internal conflict, and massive mobilization not just of military might but constantly improving military technology. The US entered the war with the B-17, the Brewster Buffalo, a few Wildcats, and the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk. It left with the B-29, a host of advanced prop planes like the P-51 Mustang, the atomic bomb, and the beginnings of jet fighter aircraft. That was in four years. That was the model, not just mass mobilization but constant advancement that no enemy could match. The pace of change giving a relatively non-micro-managed society the ability to try different things at a rate no other peer could match.This had the advantage of creating massive patronage networks. When the US establishment became afraid after Sputnik, Ike launched an effort tor recruit and pay flyover White guys to develop things like the U-2 and much later, the SR-72 Blackbird. In a technology based society, the ability to push the rate of change in technology is key. Which in turn depends on not a slave-labor workforce, the Germans in WWII, or the Soviets at every turn, or the Chinese, but one working to its own advantage and free will, that is intelligent and motivated.The father of the 11 year old White boy killed by an illegal alien Haitian drunk driver, just noted at a town council meeting that he wished his son had been killed by a 50 year old White man, not the 35 year old Haitian who actually killed him. The father is a teacher, naturally. A White sh!tlib. A natural born cuck.There was a late Bush Admin / Early Obama discussion board about TV shows. The person owning / running it noted that the most popular shows like NCIS (then ratings champ pulling in 20 million viewers) would get no comments, shows that were extremely marginal would get a massive amount of comments (like Veronica Mars, at the time of its renewal the lowest rated show to ever get renewed, I think less than a million viewers). But all from the same people. Something like 200 or so.The current cuckology religion gets massive, really complete and total investment by its adherents. But I would rate its actual size/scope to be less than Scientology, Jehova’s Witnesses, and Hari Krishnas. Combined. Elites love it, and cuckservatives defend it. But it does not scale and it can eventually only be maintained by force. Which leads to a late Roman empire collapse. Note: illiterate peasants in Central America up against the US military and their native White elites fought them to a standstill with cheap, available technology: the AK-47. FPV drones multiply that effect even further.

        conservatism, Buckley conservatism or Russell Kirk’s one are a deception and distraction that targeting white people
It’s talking about life is buy and selling, a deal maker, consumerism that makes you hollow men
Its also talk about individualism, there’s no collective interest in white because different class means different kinds
every talking point of conservatism exists to divide white people as individual
true conservatism is ethnic nationalism and collectivism which Chinese and south Korean practice

        “The master does not see [a collapse, crisis] coming, but neither do the slaves.”
Fiction might seem an odd place to glean useful historical lessons but here goes. One of the books I studied in Spanish Lit, an example of magical realism, was Alejo Carpentier’sThe Kingdom of this World.The narrative takes place during Haiti’s revolution. If one was in the previously favorable (for a slave) position of serving Massa in his home, come the revolution, those slaves’ life expectancy dropped quickly and suddenly. It greatly increased one’s odds of survival if one could pass as a field hand.

        Brilliant essay. Here are a couple examples that underscore the point. Of course they are published by one of the organizations that has huge sums and is still fighting for the Constitution and American Way of Life.https://americanmind.org/salvo/social-justice-and-the-right/^^^ I actually corresponded with this guy a bit back. He was starting to broach the anti-White topic at a time that it was not uttered in the mainstream. I wrote him and made a case for the critical importance of calling this what it is and going on the attack. He wrote me back with some smug colorblind merit excuse that never addressed my points. Now he is arguing for the antithesis of our entire civilization’s notion of justice.https://americanmind.org/salvo/diversity-ideology-undermines-the-military/^^^ Even in England, where they have no free speech at all the New Culture Forum guys are calling this what it is: the ethnic cleansing of their military. This guy not only won’t call it a racial/ethnic cleansing of the military he doesn’t even broach it. It is a matter of readiness. This in the middle of days where mass dumpings of peoples whose failed state was founded on the principle of White genocide as its sole reason for being he argues for readiness to serve the empire abroad. Anyone making the Readiness Argument and for the purposes of service to Imperial Post America is aiding and abetting the enemy.I also at some point corresponded with WILL. They were supposed to be the legal vanguard in combatting anit-White ethnic cleansing and harassment – DEI to use their safeword. I had a trove of visual documentation from one of the largest institutions on the planet openly demonizing white people. They wanted to publish some stuff anonymously and shame the company but no interest in law suits even though we could have rallied people to participate.These people are the forgotten names of the once significant or somewhat significant Roman families who frittered away time in comfort in their villas and in the provinces. Waste no time, money or energy on them. Those families ended up savaged because they had something that could be taken and those doing the taking were wolves who smelled their tender lamb flesh.We must survive and position ourselves as the prime and best contender for who will own and rule the North American continent. That is the bottom line. Who will control North America and rule it. Sit with yourself and see if that rouses your spirit. I hope it does. It is a long road. It is the tallest of orders filled with circumstances that make the original settlement pale in comparison. You will not live to see the shining city gates of welcome that our re-conquest will enter your posterity into with love and festive affections. However, what you do today to build the alternatives will lead to that glorious age. We can be the ones destined to rule if we decide to act like it today. No more energy leaked into the mausoleum of Con Inc. unless it leads to a position of strength that serves the ultimate aim.Go into the quiet wilds of the woods. Be like Remus and Romulus suckling on the nutritious sources of the supreme vitality that leads to power. Become a wolf. When opportunity and necessity dictates, have no qualms and take no quarter in strategically displacing both lambs and savages.Carpe Diem.

If they speak their minds then they clearly have some right to expression..
If you can’t express yourself openly then your freedom of expression is purely theoretical.

        “…conservatism still seemed to be driving the conversation in Washington.””Seemed” is the operative word, here.  In the 1990’s, Conservative Inc was ascendant.  Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, good times.  When a new business is growing, everyone wants in on the party.  Nobody even bothered to ask the most important question.  Is this real, it’s just a scam to take money from suckers.  In dramatic fashion, Conservative Inc proved the latter.  Trump’s election, as I wrote in 2015, was going to do one of two things.  It would either advance the many goals exposed by Con Inc, or it would put to lie every BS promise of the prior 30 years.  And we all know how that played out, with Speaker Paul Ryan quite literally throwing the House of Representatives to Pelosi so she could impeach Trump and remove him while Republicans used it to raise money.  No wall.  No Obamacare repeal.  Etc etcI agree that Con Inc lumbers on because nothing new has replaced it.  But that is only an artifact of them being protected by the State which arrests and harasses its replacements, and being protected by Big Tech censorship which keeps competing voices out.What’s going to accelerate the death on Con Inc is all these endorsements of Harris by people like the Cheneys.  More and more foot soldiers from the controlled opposition are being driven out.  The GOP is likely also facing extinction.  What good is all that money flowing into Con Inc and Republicans when they have no audience and control no votes?The smart money is looking for a new investment, and it’s only waiting for the right trigger.  If Trump prevails in November (unlikely, but we’ll see), we’re going to see another wave of exiles flee the GOP (eg a few RINO Senators will go independent or switch parties) further weakening that dead brand.If Trump loses?  The GOP is toast.  There will be widespread abandonment of the GOP as people realize, finally, that it is beyond reform.  That’s the Zero GOP movement.We’re going to have to kill the GOP to finally rid ourselves of Con Inc.  And I think that day is quickly approaching.Either way, the replacement?  Some version of MAGA, I think.  The old coalitions are breaking down.  Antiwar Democrats have no home.  Peace through strength Republicans have no home.  And they’re all having war made upon them by the state and its armies of violent vibrant.

        A bit off topic, but I had to comment about what Trump said about the consumption of cats and dogs in some parts of America.Just so your audience knows, it’s a fact they do eat dogs in Switzerland, more so by farmers in the Appenzell and St Gallen cantons. They have eaten dogs for ages, nothing new, and it’s completely legal to consume them under strict laws about how it can be done and who can consume them. However unlike horse meat, you just can’t sell dog or cat meat for public consumption.Fun fact; in 1993 an animal protection association collected some 6,000 signatures in hopes of banning the consumption of cat and dog meat. The petition was then submitted to the Parliament but it was unsuccessful.So even today, it remains perfectly legal to eat your pet cat or dog in Switzerland as long as you follow the rules.

The teeth-grinding stupidity:“If you want to identify a real problem, it will be constitutional illiteracy in our elected officials and in the voters that elect them.”

2) We will have to elect a string of conservative presidents to work with the conservative congresses.&gt;&gt;

        Not only do they not see the collapse coming, but they don’t perceive the anger boiling below the surface. When the rubber band snaps, the backlash is going to be shockingly violent as well as unexpected. And this is by design. There is a meme floating around the dissident internet that goes “first the traitors, then the invaders” and its being passed along by men who are professional in the art of violence. Methinks they won’t know what hit them, which is a mercy of sorts.

Agreed. The ones I’ve seen it from are more moral than the average bear. The only torture they will likely inflict is that the traitor never knows where his name is on the list.

                    There’s a reason they keep saying “We are a nation of immigrants”What that implies is that no one ever stops being an immigrant, thus your ownership of the country is never complete, your citizenship always has an asterisk next to it, and that if your roots here involved an immigrant then you remain an immigrant, now and foreverThat idea needs to be defeated.  There needs to be a rebuttal to it made loud and clear, because it’s that idea that seems to be paralyzing the 80% of the country or whatever it is who have immigrant roots.  They need to be able to say with total confidence that “I am not an immigrant, I belong here and this country is MINE”

        Bertrand Russell observed that “Man is a credulous animal, and must believe something; in the absence of good grounds for belief, he will be satisfied with bad ones.”Every person, society, and civilization lives by a set of myths that combine a few facts with a lot of wishful thinking. To question those myths is to endanger the survival of the person or group that depends on them. And since no human or human group is immortal, sometimes the moment arrives to question their sustaining myths. But we shouldn’t deceive ourselves about what will replace them: not hard facts, but new myths. The test of the new myths is whether or not they foster good societies and individual well-being.

        I’m noticing the Europeans took a stand, albeit small, against Israel for terrorizing the Palestinians.  This was followed by Germany taking a stand against unfettered immigration and tightening its borders. Is it that showing some moral courage regarding the former gives one authority to tackle the latter?   Is something in play?I ask because we all hear lots of bellowing from conservatives about unchecked immigration in American towns yet none of them has a word to say about Israelis doing to the Palestinians what the Haitians and South Americans are doing to us.  I mentioned this also a few days ago.is there a connection between being a tough talker on immigration but a complete door mat when it comes to Israel?  One has to wonder if the mad push from the media and government for Americans to accept mass immigration and their own displacement is part of a joint effort for them to also accept Israelis displacing the natives over there.   Because if you show moral courage vis a vis the Israelis then you would have greater moral authority to condemn what it happening in America.

            All American political discourse is bought and paid. Those cutting the checks want pro-Israel, anti-immigration rhetoric to counter the pro-Israel, pro-immigration rhetoric.
As for Europe, I do detect an opening to get out from under the Semitic yoke. Olaf has announced he will turn over Netanyahu to the International Court if he steps foot on German soil (I doubt it, but still). Relatedly, the steps against white replacement is out of fear that parties that actually might stop immigration are poised to win unless the United States interferes in their elections.

                    This is hard for me to explain, but I will tryBefore I start, it’s about always moving up the ladderRemember when, say, you (rhetorically) broke some stupid law or feel the local courthouse wronged you in its decision so you were all fired up about taking it up to the next level.  Because there you might find a wiser or more understanding judge who wasn’t some dumb local yokel.The ultimate was to “take my case to the Supreme Court!”  They’re the smartest and wisest and best in the land and surely they will see how I was always innocent!!  Justice WILL be served !We have a whole cottage industry about this, especially in the media as it pertains to blacks, where the local judge is painted as some redneck bigot but the Supreme Court as the saviors.Notice however that lately the USSC is being painted as conservative crazies who can’t be trusted to dispense justice and who just voted down RvW!!!  They must be stopped !!!What I am sensing is that there is increasing efforts to delegitimize and discredit the USSC in favor of an international body whose justices are of course wiser and superior to our own.  Even very middle of the road, sensible sorts like A Mercouris are big on the international court as a means to settle international disputes, with the implication being that the governments and courts domestically cannot be relied on to arbitrate or handle things of magnitude.  I think I even remember Justice Breyer saying he had looked at international law for guidance when making decisions for the USSC.Again, there is the constant and most likely deliberate attempt to take power and authority away from the locals and to pass up the ladder.  And now there is an apparent effort to take it one step further so that Americans now have to rely on an international court to dispense justice because their own courts can’t be trusted or relied upon.  This process and the media portrayals of racist local judges and so on has been in motion since the bussing case and Civil Rights era, but perhaps before, but that to me seems to be when it picked up speed.Make sense?

                        “…so you were all fired up about taking it up to the next level. ”
Here’s where you lost me. If the system selects for judges who cannot do justice, what’s the point in appealing to a judge who was also selected for his ability to not render justice?
Now if it were prison, sure, why not? Might as well hope for a miracle while you wait. But if it’s only money, just suck it up and try to not get on their radar again.

                            Because the perception if not the reality is that the higher up you go, the more you find judges who were “properly” educated in the Ivy League and who are up on all the latest legal theories and ideas, especially wrt race.  Judges at the local level who graduated from LSU or Alabama etc are never going to give the black man a fair shake but the Yankees will, they fought to free me.That has been the media narrative for a long while.  And I think it resonates with non-whites and also probably the poorer whites who think their bosses are out to fuck them over and if they do then the good guys on the bench will save them.  Stuff like that.

                I think tying what Israel is doing in Palestine to mass illegal immigration in America just might be the winning formula
I know this, it would be a unifying issue for the more rational people on the Left with the people on the right.  It would be a common cause.
And it will have the media and the oligarchs completely on the defensive.  Once the horrors in Palestine are made analogous to the horrors here in America and Europe, I think that would be a powerful combination and possibly a fatal blow

                        Yes, I am saying the Palestinians and American whites are each being victimized by Israelis and illegal hordes.  Which is why I surmise that the (((media))) is always trying to make the claim that acceptance of mass immigration is a moral good.  This way the inference must be that what the Israelis are doing is a moral good.Not a perfect analogy but close enough where normiecons have to make a choice, and to date they haven’t.  They continue to say the illegals busting into our towns and displacing us are bad but the Israelis busting into Palestinian villages and displacing them is good.See what I mean?  I think this is one of those threads that if you pull it the whole garment comes undone and why I think we could find common cause with the anti-Israel left.  What are Jews going to say if you say what they are doing is reprehensible and what the illegal hordes are doing is equally reprehensible?  At least there is moral consistency, and that is potent.

Falcone is right, it’s a technical knockout. Legacy Americans as the Palis appeals to the commanding heights of today’s moral frame.
A big plus is that reality is backing us: we really are the victims here.  I can naively hope that both deplorables and virtue signalers will be swayed, a bit, towards this bank of the river.

                    It could be effective. The parallels with what is happening in Ohio (and Ireland, etc.) certainly are there given the murders being reported. Both situations are ethnic cleansing being orchestrated by the same people, in one case by proxy. It would take an incredibly skilled and brave politician to be able to pull it off, and no one really fits that bill.

                        I think once the idea is put out into the public then it could build up on its own.  Once people see that we are all being treated as shitty as those poor Palestinians the light bulbs will start going off.  And maybe then a politician could come in and exploit it.  And I wouldn’t be surprised if that politician is an Irishman.  They may be the only ones with the guts and the social “infrastructure” to withstand the onslaught.

                            You can’t help but notice that within the Republic of Ireland itself, the most vocal opposition to the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians also is the most supportive of the mass migration that is destroying the country. I honestly cannot tell whether that is due to political/religious considerations or the pathological altruism that is a real thing with whites. Maybe an Irish nationalist–actual nationalist–might be able to thread the needle, but so far it is just chants of “Free Palestine!” coupled with “Welcome Refugees!”

        “In this age, it is the slow awakening from the myth of the twentieth century that foreshadows not only the end of conservatism but the end of the regime itself.”
Okay, stop beating around the bush. What is this Mythos des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts, and why does its demise betoken the end of the regime?

                Even if one leaves the official victimology of The Holocaust® untouched, which is highly recommended because in many places to do otherwise incurs risks to career, finances or even one’s personal liberty, arises the sticky problem of the fact that (horrors!) other groups died too. In fact, in the millions. [Clutch at pearls]. Gasp! It looks like it only gets worse….tens of millions! No questions, please, about our ally the Soviet Union and how many of its own citizens it disposed of well before WW II was even on anyone’s radar.

                        But the mythos of WWII and the American century was not anti-white. The bona fide anti-white narrative commenced in the second half of the sixties. In fact, I’d probably argue that this postmodern narrative began competing with the WWII mythos at about that time or maybe a bit later, and eventually supplanted it. Of if it didn’t supplant it, coopted it. Just spitballing here.

                            The statue toppling and desecration happened after the postmodern narrative took hold. If the GAE manages to hold on another decade, look for the typical WWII GI to be presented as black as a way around the whiteness of the American Century’s greatest warriors.

                                Right. The coopting approach. Seems like fairly recently Hollywood made some WWII flick (Pearl Harbor? Midway?) where one of America’s heroic fighter pilots was a numinous nuggra. Maybe Cuba Gooding or Wesley Snipes.

        I remember an article, probably from the Atlantic Monthly, published after the Dick Morris inspired Clinton’s welfare reform act of 1996 (or “welfare deform” as the lefties liked to lament). It claimed that the liberal policies and institutions that had been allowed to develop in the US were because we felt we had to prove we were really the nice guys compared to the commies. But now we had nothing to prove and it was going to be open season on all the social programs and progressive policies, etc. If the author had a crystal ball though, they wouldn’t have had a thing to worry about!

        Speaking of the Roman Empire, and how it dragged on for a while, Laurent Guyenot wrote a fascinating book about the first first millennium AD. It’s titled “Anno Domini” and the thesis is that what historians believe to have been about 1,000 years between roughly the death of Caesar Augustus and the year 1000 AD, was actually a little over 300 years, and that several historical events have been duplicated and placed at different times thereby adding about 700 years into our history books, years that never actually occurred.

            Heard that too, utterly bonkers. We’re not dependent on written sources for our history, you can track history back, year by year, with dendrochronology, dating buildings by the tree rings in the timber.

                    You also had a very civilized culture, China, and even a barbarous one, Mayan, that kept meticulous calendars as far as time passage. Sun rise, sun set X number of days would let you know a year had passed regardless of what it was called. If there has been a discrepancy found between those and the Roman version I’m unaware of it.

                    No, you’d call the time in what they called their time.  However, you’d match up events that both civilizations experienced and then translate their time to your time measurement and work from there.  Time passes the exact same way all over earth.  You just find a point where you both experience similar events, or date their structure, or whatever.  Same as you convert Fahrenheit to Centigrade.Anyone saying this doesn’t happen, or attempting to say the time from Augustus to 1000AD was really 300 years is insane and writing fantasy for the rubes.  Also, I happen to have experience withdendrochronology.  It’s sound, but not the only way to compare time measurement between cultures.  We had pretty good comparisons before dendrochronology, and even better after.

            I heard a very similar claim about Biblical timelines, that a 600 year period was duplicated, that is, used twice with minor variations to flesh out the ‘history’.I wonder if that’s related, perhaps some odd little literary niche being adapted.

                In the book he writes about some significance to the Catholic Church of the year 1000. And one of the popes wanting to be Pope during the year 1000. So they simply declared that the year 1000 was coming soon and the current pope would gain some significance from that. And who, in what we call the year 998 or so, would have been able to plausibly claim otherwise?
It’s a fascinating book, and I would like to read a critique from someone who has actually read it.

            I haven’t heard this one in a while. It’s one of those theories that gets you thinking “maybe there’s something to this crazy idea”. Then you look into things like the tree ring data that Felix mentioned and Chinese records and the whole thing evaporates. Fun to think about though. Of course, if things keep going like they have been, future people picking through the radioactive rubble of modern America may come up with even nuttier ideas to explain, well, all the nuttiness of our society.

        “The reason for that is nothing has come along to replace it.”I know its implicit that we all know there has been countless things that could’ve replaced it. Even Ron Paul’s brand of Libertarianism would’ve been a significant improvement over Con Inc. Even mentioning what the federal reserve is &amp; how it operates is a threat to the system. Even with all of the absurd trappings that would’ve came along with Ron’s brand of Libertarianism &amp; even though it would’ve never been allowed to change anything he had to be walled off to prevent damage but that’s precisely the point. Any alternative that could threaten the beast of Liberalism is a no go, even the mere allowance of an ideology that has elements that could vaguely allow information that threatens it is anathematized. Even if an ideology is batshit crazy &amp; totally self defeating any kernel of truth about foundational aspects of the system cannot be allowed.That’s why even when other ideologies that are at odds with Liberalism are “embraced” by conservatives or even the democrats for that matter it’s only the safe elements that are allowed effectively making it no different than Con Inc in actual practice. If a politician who really is outside the realm of what’s allowed on either side slips through &amp; gets access to power they’re kneecapped from doing anything that would actually affect change.If they somehow manage to reach the masses they’re dealt with by any means necessary which is explains the reaction to Trump. He’s not even a real threat to the system in any meaningful way but he upset them &amp; could very well be a slippery slope to someone who is. If he really was a direct threat he’d have ended up like the dead Kennedys a long time ago &amp; ironically it was his non threatening nature &amp; the system’s confidence in having everyone trained like dogs that he was even able to get where he is.Anyway, the point is, conservatism was designed from the ground up to fail, protect Liberalism from threats &amp; give the illusion of choice to the masses.“It may be inferred again that the present movement for women’s rights will certainly prevail from the history of its only opponent,Northernconservatism.This is a party which never conserves anything. Its history has been that it demurs to each aggression of the progressive party, and aims to save its credit by a respectable amount of growling, but always acquiesces at last in the innovation.What was the resisted novelty of yesterday is today one of the accepted principles of conservatism; it is now conservative only in affecting to resist the next innovation, which will tomorrow be forced upon its timidity, and will be succeeded by some third revolution to be denounced and adopted in its turn.American conservatism is merely the shadow that follows Radicalism as it moves towards perdition. It remains behind it, but never retards it, and always advances near its leader.This pretended salt hath utterly lost its savor: wherewith shall it be salted?Its impotency is not hard, indeed, to explain. It is worthless because it is the conservatism of expediency only, and not of sturdy principle.”–Robert L. DabneyEmphasis on the word northern is mine, obviously, he wrote that in 1871. Nothing has fundamentally changed since the end of the Civil War. Sure, there’s been new races who have been imported &amp; recruited to the factions of rulers who certainly have their differences &amp; unique quirks but in big picture they all agree with Liberalism. The very nature of Liberalism entails its own destruction &amp; fractionation which is why there’s power struggles behind the scenes.Biden’s ineptitude is sometimes useful like how he, in kissing jew’s asses, talked about how they’ve always been the leaders in degeneracy, civil rights &amp; the like. More to the point he also said that if Israel didn’t exist they’d have to invent it for the purposes of the American empire. The empire itself is just the new iteration of the Anglo-Zionist, though I’ve since come to learn that those Anglos are Scandinavian in origin but that’s a topic for another day. That empire’s HQ used to be based out of London but shifted to the US &amp; once evil prevailed in the Civil War &amp; the fresh minimally regulated America naturally became successful it surpassed its former master &amp; took its place.Israel may be a product of &amp; depend on the empire &amp; for a long time had some shared interests but they always had their own divergent interests &amp; so too do all the newly imported savages who were brought here for many reasons but mainly to ethnically cleanse the enemies of the people who have been running this country since the end of the Civil War.This factionalism runs deep &amp; isn’t black and white, you have jews like Henry Kissinger whose baby was the American empire, not Israel. That’s why he got denounced as a heretic by Klaus Schwab &amp; George Soros for saying the Empire should walk back what they did with the financial system against Russia, end the Ukraine war &amp; essentially ask for forgiveness. He knows where this is headed &amp; that it means the end of all that he worked for building the American empire. Even the Empire itself is expendable in the pursuit of the promised utopia of Liberalism which is why it has left him behind. As for Israel if not for the mossad network of blackmail, among many other methods of control &amp; coercion, of which Epstein inadvertently revealed to the masses, even though it wooshed right past them, the US wouldn’t be at their mercy with this optics blunder that’s currently underway. That’s just one of many examples of how inherently unstable it is now.Before I said the rulers all agreed on the big issues but we’re currently witnessing the beginning stages of that breaking apart due to the latent instability of late stage Liberalism. That problem is completely systemic now &amp; is sure to produce chaos in ways we can’t even fathom.Some recent example that’s currently underway is sudden appearance ofhugeimpossible to miss invasive bugs tagging along on food imports due to diversity hires being put in charge. We have the return of diseases long wiped out by practices of cleanliness &amp; savage paganism torturing animals being practiced right out in the open in leftist strongholds where immigrants flock to. A split personality back &amp; forth view towards police- defund them! Oh no, wait, who will enforce anarcho tyranny without the police? They turned on them &amp; now can had to lower standards so much that they hiring felons &amp; people who are not even remotely capable of doing that job.Liberalism can’t square that off so you end up with black cops who accidentally beating a precious savage to death trying to restrain him &amp; the response is to claim they have internalized White supremacy &amp; treat them with the same harshness they treat traditional Whites with.Circling back around, Con Inc has been a necessary ingredient in acting as controlled opposition for the purposes of keeping the enemies of Liberalism from ever standing in its way. I don’t know what the death of Con Inc will bring but I suspect that the fangs will really start to come out as people start drifting into genuinely dangerous ideological territory. At the same time their ability to stop it will also wane with everything falling apart that also just so happens to coincide with the amount of material wealth &amp; comfort being rapidly degraded.Take this recent hubbub about those haitans in Ohio &amp; now apply it to the whole country, even with material wealth that sort of thing renders any semblance of comfort null &amp; void &amp; replaces it with rage &amp; disgust. The closer we get to utopia the closer we get to people having nothing to cling to, less reason to respect the law &amp; less able to make the argument that watering the tree of liberty with blood is an act of terrorism.When I said yesterday that we’re all going to be mad men by the next election cycle that pertains to us, we who pay close attention to this &amp; aren’t blindsided by the chaos. How many more pointless elections that change nothing will pass by before the normies join our madness? Time will tell. No guarantee it’ll lead to anything good but its certainly going to be interesting to see how this unprecedented chaos unfolds.

        “Father Of Child Killed By Haitian Migrant Says He ‘Wishes His Son Had Been Killed By A White Man”The host mentioned reading The Declaration the other day and I’ve also been reading some older histories of the English Rev. and the some of the Parliamentary declarations justifying the actions they were contemplating. We tolerate conditions imposed by our illegitimately installed and unrepresentative rulers at least as bad as those that motivated these other historical power conflicts.The pressure to thwart the right to free assembly and censor all dissent from white citizens of European decent in general, the seeming overreaction to a benign and actually fairly competent leader who happened to appeal to that constituency (though not exclusively so and I mean that in both the passive and active senses of the word) reveal the extent of the fear and loathing the rulers have of what is still the numerical majority in the US.We as white US citizens should focus significant effort on establishing a representative political organization. If history is any guide the rulers will continue to try to suppress it which will just radicalize it further over time. No one can predict success of course but who wants to live in a society so hostile to their existence? One in which parents are pressured to make unimaginably perverted public statements about their murdered children. One in which their children are deliberately inundated with synthesized opiate derivative drugs so powerful and dangerous the death toll from accidental overdose exceeds those of modern wars. Someday, hopefully, we will have such a representative body that will make a similar public declaration that could better enumerate and articulate to the world and posterity why we are justified in throwing off the malign and destructive oppressors.

        “It has been dead as an intellectual endeavor for a long time”
I question the entire concept of making this sort of thing an “intellectual endeavor.” There’s a trite old phrase in politics about how there isn’t a Republican way of picking garbage or a Democrat way of picking garbage. Practical over theoretical wins the day, not to mention that conservative “theory” is a lot of talk, but has accomplished practically nothing people want.

        I thank God every day the conservacuck boomers are dying off and taking their demonic Judeo-Christian Universalism with them. Future generations will equate them with insane ideologies like Salem witch trials, Jonestown and “Jesus was a Jew” wackadoodles.
A genuine Christian revival is blossoming and will put an end to Judeo-Christianism once an for all.
