        Since Sam Francis made the news this week, it’s worth quoting him with regard to “anarcho-tyranny:”What we have in this country today, then, is both anarchy (the failure of the state to enforce the laws) and, at the same time, tyranny – the enforcement of laws by the state for oppressive purposes; the criminalization of the law-abiding and innocent through exorbitant taxation, bureaucratic regulation, the invasion of privacy, and the engineering of social institutions….….they are the laws that directly punish those recalcitrant and “pathological” elements in society who insist on behaving according to traditional norms – people who do not like to pay taxes, wear seat belts, or deliver their children to the mind-bending therapists who run the public schools; or the people who own and keep firearms, display or even wear the Confederate flag, put up Christmas trees, spank their children, and quote the Constitution or the Bible – not to mention dissident political figures who actually run for office and try to do something about mass immigration by Third World populations.

        Fascinating, too, how the Managerial Class sticks with its one “solution” well past the point of diminishing returns, to the point where it becomes an accelerant to collapse.  Rome kept throwing forts and legions at the barbarians; Easter Islanders kept building those stone heads until they destroyed their ecosystem; and our modern Managerial Class goes all in on being the JV Thought Police.If they were smart, Eurozone leaders would go the full caesarism route, and set up a tame “anti-immigrant” party.  Let them bluster, let them hold rallies, and arrest anyone who steps out of line — the masses think that real change is juuuuust around the corner if they keep voting, the Elites get to keep the status quo, and, best of all, the few folks who are actually willing to use physical violence tip their hands too soon… you can arrest them as individuals, rather than being forced to turn water cannons and rubber bullets on them in a riot.  Plus, all the potential leaders of a real anti-immigrant insurgency are tainted by association with the fakey-fake “anti-immigrant party.”But that would require a little foresight — not Frau Merkel’s strong suit, obviously.  Which is what kills me about these Management turds — they’re as Machiavellian as can be, but they’re also really dumb, so half the time it seems like Dr. Evil is really running the show.

            My experience is that the managerial class is Machiavellian because they are stupid. Being long on ambition and short on talent, they spend most of their time planning on how to keep power instead of building and improving.
I believe that Stalin would do something similar to what you describe in Eastern Europe between 1945-48.  The NKVD would set up a “Peasants Party” to flush out the “Kulak wreckers,” arrest them, then disband the party or have the remaining tame leadership demand to merge with the Communist Party so they could help build the glorious socialist future.

                Yep.  Mao did the same thing with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.  Just a few years before, he proclaimed “let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend.”  Then, once the 99 schools that didn’t agree with Mao had come out of hiding, he sicced the Red Guards on them.  That’s why I love reading up on old commie shenanigans — evil wasn’t always as retarded as it is today, and collaborators at least had to be somewhat intelligent to cut it.  None of the current Managerial Class would even be allowed to sweep the floor at a fellow travelers’ meeting in the Fifties.

        Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. Is this Europe’s version of whistling past the graveyard? With the notable exception of some Eastern Europe countries, Europe appears to be run by professional quislings. There are now two choices before them, both horrifying. They can capitulate to Those Who Must Not Be Named and join the growing caliphate, or they can prepare for a bloody war within their borders.

        I wish I could remember, so as to give credit where due, the writer who described the police in Western countries today as “the paramilitary wing of the Cultural Marxist Establishment.”Like most employees who want to keep their jobs and benefits, the police will serve their masters … up to a point. How do they feel when they knock on doors where people, perhaps not unlike themselves, live in order to deliver the shut-up-if-you-know-what’s-good-for-you package? Granting a certain amount of corruption among the uniformed plods, it still seems likely that some will identify with the unofficial “criminals” who must be warned against speaking their minds.For things to change, a critical mass is needed. The servants of the Supreme State won’t rebel individually. But when — let’s hope we don’t have to say “if” — they are convinced that they will not be alone, but will have support from a large contingent of their colleagues, theywillbite the hand that feeds them. Police who actually work the streets are no strangers to the need for decisive action now and then.

            That is the Trump vote, almost entirely. A rebellion, not an endorsement.

        The first thing they did after the Rotherham rape story in England was also to raid a few twitter users…Well the official slogan of the EU is “United in diversity” after all, by hook or by crook, so bend over shitizen!

        “The logic of the solution, is to bully the weaker side hoping they will roll over and take it.  Given the degraded state of European culture, that’s not a bad bet – for now.”
Did you know the history behind the creator of the European Union? Search for Richard Von Coudenhove-Kalergi, it’s worth it.

        You said “peculate”  – did you perhaps mean “percolate” ?
