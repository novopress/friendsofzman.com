        The tranzis (yet another word for the prog elite cloud people) long ago roped us into running the world monetary system, policing the global commons, maintaining a very expensive deterrent, and since the end of the Cold War, heading into harm’s way from time to time to punish idiots who significantly challenge the world system.I’m not completely adverse to backing out of all of our commitments, but I do not believe that the American people or political system would survive the resultant upheaval. China would almost certainly start coercing the East Asian nations into paying tribute. The resultant upheavals in Dar al Islam would send oil prices through the roof and the emigration out of MENA would swamp Europe. The costs would be very high.My guess is that if we did try to disengage fully (not the half-assed version currently being implemented), the American people would be begging the progs to restore the status quo ante so they could keep getting their $20 microwaves at Walmart.  I dunno, maybe in a few years we’ll be able to 3-D print cell phones and 70″ flat screens for the proles and have cheap fusion. Then all we’ll need is the deterrent.
