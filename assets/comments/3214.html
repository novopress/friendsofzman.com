        I haven’t seen the Viking series, but I might actually check it out now that I’ve read the gender roles are depicted accurately. My husband and I often remark about how it seems the women in TV shows seem to have all the answers and kick the butts of everyone in their paths, while the men just watch and rely on the woman with all the answers. I’m a female, and this upsets me. Being feminine isn’t wrong if you’re a woman, and men need to keep on being men, not being wimps.

Vikings does a good job sticking close to reality with this. The history part is bungled, but the show itself is great entertainment. Not terribly violent by the standards of TV and the violence actually moves the story along so it is not gratuitous. I enjoyed it.

        […] if anyone notices if I linked to them. The other day I linked to the British History Podcast in this post about the Eloi. Jamie Jeffers, the narrator of the podcast, uses WordPress for his site and must have got a notice […]

        This happened a few times as we got drunk and it occurred to me that these kids were probably quite typical. They spend half their awake time in Massachusetts public schools. Throw in organized activities and they have little time not marinating in the PC culture.
================
Sounds like a Massachusetts thing to me. Kids I interact with here in Colorado don’t seem much like that

        Junior, that is a theory that a friend of mine holds as well: the Eloi are simply the unfit who in any reasonably Darwinian scenario, would never have made it past childhood. They won’t fight because they are unfit. They won’t work hard because they are unfit. They don’t have babies because they lack the drive to reproduce.
If true, the next die off will be a very big die off.

        Didn’t wars and disease sort these things out in the batabaric times?   We haven’t had a good Spanish flu or bloodletting in a long time.   That should sort out the Eloi in short order.

        The puff trend is certainly present but not everywhere.  I live in the south and men are doing manly jobs and women still do hair and nails and want to raise babies. Let us not judge an entire culture by the wimping of a law student or the tripe of NPR type media fags (no insult) intended.  In real America there still are boys and girls, men and women, they just don’t get notice.

        The immigrants from Mexico, Central America, Asia and Muslim Africa do not share the Eloi culture. They are a threat to that culture, and to native blacks, and how the US will evolve because of them is unpredictable. The Eloi were eaten by the Morlocks “The Time Machine.”

        The winners of the culture wars are creating a post American, Euro weenie society via their piety charts.  What I fear is that what you describe is the youth culture of the educated and ambitious, while the uneducated and ambitious are growing increasingly savage, with none of the societal anchors or leadership that used to come from the elites.We are heading for a national version of what Paris has become, an island of enforced calm surrounded by a sea of hatred and doom.  It will hold this way until those men who have the legal right to violence are forced to decide which side they want to win, and given that for many the mob is their kin, it’s not at all certain they’ll choose the way of civilization.

        Interesting article, and thanks for the link to the British History podcast which might have some populist overtones (and an obsession on the show with calling life-or-death power struggles ‘politics’ as if it is a debate hoping for good media coverage, but then my home is in the Elmet tribal area of England and I never could trust those Mercians…)As for the fact that the young of today are not interested in finding out about the world is typical of what I have found. Their interest levels in life are hemmed in by the limits of social media (imagining it is all inclusive when in fact it it is a manipulative and narrow zone) and what they can get cheaply within their own bubble. Someone else will provide for them they are sure, and they haven’t a clue how things come about or for that matter what they can do to preserve them.The danger is that like the Eloi the future generations that spring from the current lot will be cut off from a lot of life, but even more curious is how the young of today believe in tacitly supporting those who would be the Morlocks nipping at their ankles, the ones using brutality to shape the world in order to gain control.The hope of the wimpy liberals is in avoiding being eaten by the monsters they allow by sacrificing others first to the increasing Morlock hunger. The vague hope that the coming Morlocks will be subtly influenced by ‘hope and change’ in social media chatter may not be enough to save the new Eloi when their turn comes.

        It sounds less a change of direction than it is the end of the line.
