        The level of betrayal to average Americans is off the charts. Of course we get some things we always wanted but too late in the long run. Did I hear right, a trillion for defense?Elon will always be alright but even he has to feel mightily used after all of this.
Sure, tell me one more time the old quote that there is much ruin in a nation.

            How else will we defend Israel,  counter Russian aggression and make war with China if we don’t increase defense spending?  If anything the Senate will probably add money to the defense budget. As if there is an actual budget, ha ha.

            We live in an Empire, don’t you know. This isn’t Lithuania and I don’t work in an office in Kaunas.
My neighbors are from India, Puerto Rico, and Vietnam. My boss is Nigerian. I have friends and family who voted for Biden and Kamala.
We should temper expectations. We are never going to get 100 or even 50% of what we want. The fact that Z doesn’t absolutely hate the BBB, and neither do a lot of New Right content creators, means that it’s as good as we could possibly get.

                For better or worse, Trump is my barometer. If he signs off on it, that means it’s okay. Otherwise, he would go nuclear and it would be fairly easy to crush Republican opposition because nobody likes them. They have no base.

                            He hasn’t started any wars? He’s done worse than that: he’s continued and energised wars he was elected to stop. And there’s no guarantee with this buffoon that he won’t do something extremely stupid with Iran.

                                Don’t forget we are currently on track to do something stupid with China and we just did something very stupid with Russia.
We are well on our way to a multi-front WW3 and potential nuclear holocaust.

                                    Some careful detente with Russia over the past few years would have reaped large gains.  Cooperation is better for everybody except the MIC and corporations like Blackrock.
Cooperation — including freezing out China — might actually aid the American citizenry!
But no.
Instead we pretend they’re the Bad Guys and our globohomo agenda is righteous, it’s all so tiresome.

                The fact is that the U.S. is essentially ungovernable, which is why the elites are looting it instead of trying to govern it in the classical/Aristotelian sense of being the “best citizen,” creating the “best regime,” and all of that.It’s not a bunch of pre-industrial white Protestants any more, scattered across thirteen or twenty or even 48 states with a handful of Negroes and Indians to deal with on the margins. It’s literally impossible to govern by “the will of the people” because we have imported so many foreigners and created so many identity groups it isn’t one people any more.“E pluribus unum” is dead, kids.

            It’s a bullshit bill and should be killed.  Musk was played for a fool.
Trump is returning to his true form, that is a hapless blowhard.
The point of the exercise is to get what we can from the GOP while destroying them in the process.

            Just skimmed a YT video where the guy correctly notes the “big beautiful bill” contains lots of crap but – as Zman says – a few good crumbs.  Take the tax cuts (the only thing Congress ever passes with a preset sunset clause) and put you and your family first.  No, they aren’t ‘good’ for the overall economic ‘health’ of AINO, but f**k AINO.  Trump and most dems want to raise the debt limit by $3 trillion over the next decade.  In ten years’ time, the total debt plus interest will be over $75 trillion.  AINO is toast.  Just prepare as able for family/genuine friends.  The rest of the cuckwhites and various mystery meat?  Zero f**ks to give.

        In the end, I expect the Senate to strip out anything even remotely related to Trump’s agenda and it just ends up being a permanent extension of the TCJA as well as codifying the IHRA definition of antisemitism into federal law. In other words, all Trump can get through Congress then and now is a tax bill. As Z always mentions, you cannot expect the system to reform the system. But this will increase noticing, everyone can see just how perfidious, anti-White, and anti-American the Republican Party is. It seems they are still just trying to wait out Trump, which honestly may be the best idea from their POV as they likely assume that they can get Vance and whoever else to their side. But they don’t understand that the conservative movement is totally dead.

                Makes sense.  I’d note that the Dem’s forever considered the Blacks to be in their thrall—where else are/were they to go?  Now that Blacks and other minorities are targeted by the Rep’s, the Whites are in the same position via a vis the Rep’s.  Where are we to go?  That’s what happens when the demographics change and Whites are just another minority among minorities.  It will inevitably become worse.

                    It would be nice if a genuine populist “restoration” party could be built as the GOP dies and the Democrats become even more insane. The idea would be to rally the 3.5 original ethnies (Whites, Blacks, Native Americans, and then the 0.5 is some of the Spanish speakers who were part of the Old West). The rallying would be around a core of populist issues, basically, re-industrialization, isolationism, nationalism, and a rejection of QWERTY ideology. You know, a party that would actually take the side of the vast majority of actual normal, heterosexual people living in this country instead of Israel, mega-corps, aliens (whether “legal” or illegal), addicts, and sexual and moral degenerates.It’s astounding that we actually have to ask for something like this since in virtually every other nation, ALL the political parties have traditionally agreed on these foundations. The recent exceptions like the UK, EU, Australia, and Canada are changing their political systems to be more like the American Uniparty.

                Minor nitpick: “anti anti” is a double negative amounting to a positive, so while I agree with your intended characterization of the Democrats, you’ll want to be sure you end up with an odd number of anti’s.   I count only six.

                Conservatism has been a shambling zombie since Trump came down the escalator. It’s why so many cons have unmasked themselves as being just liberals, and also why so many liberals have thrown in with the deep state and endless war.
It exists in the sense that there are magazines that pump out stuff and get donors and have conferences and politicians who self-identify as conservatives but it’s a dead force.

If you do the numbers, 1,000,000/year isn’t even treading water. It’s just sinking more slowly. Which, now that I think of it, is classic Republican Party.

        The “Big, Beautiful Bill” is proof that this country is dead. The system will collapse, either from its corrupt, fetid bloated weight of so many beaks looking to get wet, or from a populace that finally realized that new leaders and a new system are needed for proper and moral governance.Our system is like the old tale of the Taco Bell that was infested by vermin to a degree that the franchisee realized it’d be cheaper to tear down the structure and build a new one than exterminate the vermin living and breeding in his restaurant.One way or another, the system can’t survive like this. Something drastic has to be done at least to get the country’s debt situation under control.

            Yep. Trump was the last hope that a single POTUS can turn things around. After only 5 months we can see that he not only failed but didn’t even try. The US and collective West is beyond political, economic and social reform and will be “cured” by disintegration and collapse.

            One of the many things Trump has not adequately explained about what he’s doing and why is that many of his moves (especially DOGE and the tariffs) have been directed at taking on the deficits that the country has casually run for decades and preventing a “debt death spiral”. Perhaps he hasn’t talked about this because there’s a lot of Maff involved and Merkans are notoriously bad at Maff so he went with his usual razzle-dazzle and showmanship approach.Just for shits and giggles I made a little computer model in a spreadsheet starting with a debt of $35T (roughly what it was) in 2024 and assuming that spending continues to exceed revenue by a couple Tn a year and the interest on the debt is 4.62%. To be brief, we are already in the exponential region of the graph. I didn’t even do things like having the interest rate rise as it must to get foreigners to buy the ever growing amount of T-bonds.The model US, unlike the real one, was actually fixable. One thing I tried was having revenue equal like 130% of spending. This caused the debt to fall as surpluses we used to reduce it each year. By 2056 the debt was cut roughly in half. Think about what you’ve seen lately in the media and from every part of the political system. DoesANYpart of the American public or ruling elite seem like it would tolerate the taxes and spending cuts needed to produce that large a surplus?So the system is doomed. There are various scenarios about whatkindof doom it will face. From what I see they seem to fall into several categories. There’s the default on the debt option. There’s the massive money printing idea where you deliberately produce hyperinflation so that you can eventually pay off the debt for the price of a cup of coffee. Of course, that’s basically just a slower version of the first option. Then you have sci-fi options like some deux ex machina invention that allows everyone to produce vastly more economic value per hour.In any scenario but the sci-fi ones you get massive civil unrest and the nation disintegrates. I hope this is wrong but I don’t see many people talking realistically about the drastic measures that would be needed to avoid disaster. I don’t think the country has the social cohesion for the level of sacrifice that would be needed. Everyone, from Right to Left, would assume that the surpluses were just being stolen by one of the other factions and this is probably what would happen too.

        Speaking of a reordering, the Republican Vice President just openly insulted National Review.  Which was fitting the day after John Fund wrote “The Conservative Case for Harvey Milk” for them.  Yet the GOP establishment still trudges on thinking the Trump era will end and they will return to their rightful place atop the party.

                According to the comments, Fund’s defense of Milk was that he supported Barry Goldwater and once opposed a tax increase in San Francisco. If Fund is willing to put his name to that, I would say there isn’t anything he could be told to write that he would refuse.NR editors would love to have their former readers replaced by third worlders.

                    How remarkable is it that battles over issues 60 years ago still serve as templates in the minds of people like Fund as relevant to the current historical context. Goldwater was dealing with problems that no longer exist, answers to which are useless in our own time, and he would probably be the first to say so, as he was a furniture salesman with little philosophical or historical bent. These clowns have gummed up conservatism for 40 years with their inane hero worship. Totally impractical fools.

                        That’s basically correct. Goldwater and the USSR and San FranCrisco tax rates mean nothing now. Perversion, depravity and abnormality, which are what Harvey Milk symbolizes, lie at the heart of the war against Western civilization. Fund, National Review and conservatives ride with the savages massing at the gates, and they have been for about 20 years now.

                        Yea, Fund’s message is that Milk is basically just Reagan with a rent boy, and who cares about the rent boy? What Fund never grapples with, and what they never grapple with whenever they talk about how MLK Jr. was actually conservative, is if this is the case, then why are they liberal heroes? Liberals mostly hate Goldwater and Reagan, so if Milk was a conservative hero like they were, then why don’t they hate him?
It just shows how intellectually bankrupt this whole con movement is.

            “The Conservative Case for Harvey Milk”
Saw you mention this and okay I just had to read it. So of course it turns out that Harvey Milk was a low-tax free-market conservative! OF COURSE! This is why the Obama cabal put his name on it… to honor his conservatism and free market principles! That is why people still talk about this pervert today, because of his staunch small-business bonafides.
These people do not understand the friend-enemy distinction and never will. Or, maybe we just are actually their enemy.

                Harvey the ‘Orrible considered Genghis Khan a commie.  Figured Reagan for a Hollywood pinko. People aren’t informed about that.  Harv is simply misunderstood by lesser lights.
‘These people do not understand the friend-enemy distinction and never will’
Well sure they do.  Somebody gets tossed outside the city walls, into the feral void, along with the dogs.

                    I was a center-right Democrat until that phrase became an oxymoron and the zeitgeist made me a refusenik. Since I live in a one-party town, I try to vote for the odd (relatively) sane Dem when possible. Otherwise I tend to vote for Repub candidates. I remain an independent, though, since I’m not ready to openly admit or display anything proclaiming: I’m With Stupid.

                The real way to handle this “problem” is to change policy back traditional naming, wherein individuals were of naval hero’s rather than political figures.
One should order a review of all current names and recommend renaming for all that do not meet traditional naming schemes.  Hell, even the Soviets did this after Stalin.

                    You know why that logical naming system (SSBNs replaced BBs for state names) went by the wayside? Politics.
Admiral Hyman Rickover said “fish don’t vote” when he started the practice of naming submarines after congresscritters that voted for his programs, like South Carolina’s Mendel Rivers.
Then came the SSN-688 class that became the Los Angeles class. The city names were intended to rope congresscritters into voting for their funding. It wasn’t offensive.
Then we stopped naming aircraft carriers after famous battles (Saratoga, Yorktown, Lexington) and famous ships (Ranger, Essex) and naming them instead after worthless politicians.

                The latter proclivity is…not unknown to Harvey Milk’s tribe, which manifests itself in the former–among other behaviors. My kind has its allotment of socio-  and psychopaths,  but ours tend toward violent “nationalism” rather than deviant conduct, financial chicanery, “aesthetic” nihilism or political intrigue.

        The question that hangs over all of this is whether it comes by the pen or by the sword.
My vote is the sword. I am not aware of any empire in history on a downward trajectory  reversed by administrative changes. But there was a lot of weeping and gnashing of teeth on the way down. At least a good old-fashioned Pinochet-style house cleaning might at least provide some chance of some possible future for our people. Low chance, but at least there’s a chance. The alternative is the boot stamping on our face forever.

            I’m for that in theory, but in reality it’s never very neat and tidy and predictable. When it comes to that the goons in charge are going to fuck up anyone they don’t like and that would be people like us as well as the lefties. How many people here are cops or soldiers right now? When the SHTF you’re either wearing their uniform or you’re not.I met a dude from Croatia once who had emigrated here. During the unpleasantness of the 1990s he had to go back for some family matters and was promptly arrested and the cops beat the fuck out of him for a week until they were convinced he wasn’t a spy or a traitor.He said when shit becomes unglued, it puts all the true crazies into power.

        “There is $46 billion to build the wall Trump promised a decade ago”
It costs 46 billion to build a wall? Jesus Christ
Isn’t that close to the entire cost of the Russian military budget?  A thought occurred to me yesterday.  Ukraine is like the American stock market.  Without government support, both would be much smaller then they currently are!  😉

        This is a very cogent take on the situation. A reasonable retort is that the BBB keeps spending at $7 trillion per year when the FedGov budget was $5T pre-Covid. Does anyone here think the Federal government was too small in 2019 at $5T? Yes there are some nice Easter eggs in the BBB, like the border wall and the “no tax on tips” Zman refers to, but overall, it keeps us marching to bankruptcy. Sadly, our choice seems to be to choose bankruptcy overrun by cholos or bankruptcy ruled by AI, H1B pajeets and feral Somalis. I pray we choose wisely.

        There are a lot of very intelligent people working within the dissident community and many of them are speaking out on the various platforms accorded by the internet, e.g. blogs, podcasts, messaging apps like X/Gab, and email. Almost all of this activity is directed at revelation and analysis, often accompanied by prognostication. A day will come when this resource must be redirected toward solutions rather than endless study. At minimum, that would include contingency planning. You can train yourself to make this transition efficiently. We prevail with our intelligent first.

        As long as they can print as many Weimar dollars as they want, we’ll be fine. Of course, a hamburger at Wendy’s might be $25 and minimum wage at $45 an hour, but people are too stupid to hold them to account.

            There will be an inevitable collapse as the inflation accelerates.  Your Weimar comparison is incomplete/inaccurate.  The situation in Weimar Germany was so off the rails that there are pictures of wheelbarrows full of money and reports of companies paying workers at *noon* so they could take off and buy food before the afternoon price rises.Of course, we now have digital currency so wheelbarrows areunnecessary.However, there are any number of modern examples of hyperinflation—such as Argentina/Zimbabwe—where the system is so perturbed as to be unworkable with their own currency as a mechanism of exchange among the populace.I doubt we can print ourselves out of such.

            When a burger costs $25, which it already does at any place that employs white people who aren’t on parole, the minimum wage will be the same as it is today.The Republican Party’s role in the economic show is to make you believe that wages and inflation are correlated, and to ensure that they’re not.They’ve trained us to get excited at news of the government not taxing something. Taxes come from people, not from things.Whois paid in tips? Not young white fathers. Notyou.Do sommeliers vote Republican? Do strippers? Of course not. And they never will. But they’re getting paid for Republicans winning. Republican voters are not. They get the “pain.”

                Elected republicans are fools and greedy. Their perfect society is made up of sub-minimum wage serfs making products and services dirt cheap to be sold dearly to the people of the country. They can’t seem to grok that workers who make nothing can’t afford their over-priced crap. If they get their way consumerism dies because everyone is on subsistence wages. No ownership, no buying except bare necessities and a lot of anarchy. They think they’ll be fine but eventually the favelas will come for them.

        An informative piece and nothing wrong with pointing out positives, even in a rathole like D.C.  We gotta remember that they are mere employees, but not OUR employees as we were taught and so goofily assumed.Business-as-usual tho, be not hypnotized by the whirling wheels.  Goddess Columbia’s District stills hates my guts and those of my brethren, for our offense of existing while male, while white even! but especially for being Christian — their enemy-religion.I contend for God’s holy patriarchy and they are retrograde minions of Mother Right, to ripoff the wonderful philologist J.J. Bachofen.  I’ll admit it was satisfying when they published their fear of me and the boys, the Disinformation Governance Gestapo.  Made me feel kinda squishy, all warm and wanted.  :O)

        “There is $46 billion to build the wall Trump promised a decade ago. Given how incensed both parties were over this idea when it was proposed, this should be viewed as progress. ”Should it? When Trump 1 took office, the estimated cost was in single digits—$8-12B. The CBO estimated the cost at double that, $24B. Trump 1 completed about 500miles of new wall. Now Trump 2 wants, or will be allocated, $46B to finish less wall! This is progress?My suspicion is that this is less progress than “pork”. The entire bill is a farce with some “peanuts” thrown in to placate the rubes—but even those peanuts are subject to waste and corruption.The bottom line is that a democratic process to allocate spending priorities inevitably declines into a grab bag of grift and theft. A robber who accosts you with a gun on the street is a more honest person—and more so, the odds of him robbing you repeatedly is smaller than our *elected* thieves in Congress.

            You forget that Biden tore down the Trump wall and other border fencing out of spite. IIRC, they even donated the scrap to some degenerate cause.
To our point, yes, is 99% of the usual bullshit, but normally it is 110% of the usual bullshit. Hence my line about these crumbs being the sesame seeds decorating the turd sandwich.

                For all their intellectual shortcomings, blacks long ago accepted the most Democrats would provide them amounted to crumbs. Whites are delusional if they think the GOP even would be that generous. Give it nothing and take the sparse crumbs, peasants. That is the best the system will be able to offer until it goes tits up in the near future.

        Interesting the Trump / Musk feud went nuclear in about half a day. Trump musing about canceling the contracts with Space X, and Musk saying that Trump is in the Epstein files and that’s the reason they will never be public. Along with Musk threatening to start a new political party that would hand control of Congress to the Democrats easily.
It looks like the Trump Admin is now over. Get ready for President Jeffries.

        But will the army of Indian cube warmers be sent home? Or, will the empire horse trade their remittance payments for India staying onside as a geopolitical counterweight to China?The modus operandi of the utterly bizarre GAE to this point has been to choose destroying the empire they are running by giving it away to its supposed clients.When Zhongdong, Shankar, Ismael, Doron, Srinivas and Zhingyi are no longer interviewing Americans for jobs at American companies I will believe it. Moreover, will they go back home if or when the jobs are gone? From a DFW suburb or a Palo Alto hillside dream home to an apartment in Mumbai overlooking butts poking out of aluminum siding shacks into the clay and dust, “toilet”, is what that means for them.By the looks of every ounce of propaganda and imagery coming from the oligarchy, those people are far more sancrosanct and dear to them than Winston, John, Paul, Mary and Bradley.It will be interesting to see how this plays out and how Winston, John, Paul, Mary and Bradley are going to get themselves a seat at the table; especially since the plan is to attract the capital from the aformentioned non-American’s homelands to invest here.

                I always say, “Ask them.” Or, look what they’re saying. (Nobody should talk to any of them.)
No Indian will leave the West voluntarily. They consider their presence here—theirknowingly unwelcome and destructivepresence—a racial crusade.
Which is to say, they’ve fully accepted the terms they’ve been offered by our governments and businesses. Look whattheysay.

        Non-American here: why is this all in one bill? Seems to be begging for everyone to add his own pork in order to pass it. Why not a hundred bills each debated on their merits?

            That’s the point, so that The Blob’s entire wish list can be enacted without pushback or debate. Moreover, breaking it up into smaller bills would require congress critters to spend time doing their jobs, which would interfere with their primary activity, fundraising.

        I thought Sen. Johnson made a reasonable point. The feds are basically continuing Covid era spending years after the pandemic ended. Congress should go through the BBB line-by-line and remove or modify the programs that are wasteful or absurd (with the DOGE info handy) until the spending is reduced to something within reason. That would also mean that they would actually read the bill. Congresswoman MTG was shocked to learn that a ban on state regulation of AI was in the bill. It was pointed out to her that, had she read the bill, she would not have been shocked.  Not only do they not read the bills, they often don’t write them (that’s what lobbyists and staffers are for).

        The show will go on as long as the bond market lets it. Granted, we’re already seeing a few cracks. Whether those will be contained or grow is anyone’s guess, but demanding that the bond market absorb ~$9 trillion a year in US govt debt ($2 trillion deficit, $7 trillion rollover debt) is asking a lot. It was ~$6 trillion just a few years ago.
Can a govt survive paying a third of its revenue in interest payments? What if that goes to 40%? The odds aren’t good, but when the day of reckoning arrives is unknowable.

                There is unlikely to be a sudden, total default. There will be a little bit of defaulting here, and a little bit of defaulting there. Probably hardly anyone will notice at first.

        It is at least educational to watch, in real time, the greatest experiment in deficit spending in world history. Complete with markets that allow you to place your bets as to whether, how, and when it will become “unsustainable.” But it’s difficult at best, and foolish at worst, to bet against a rigged market. As Soros told David Rogers Webb, author of The Great Taking, “you don’t know what they can do.” Even someone as well placed as Jaime Dimon, when predicting a bond market blowup, doesn’t know if it’s in six months or six years.

        It is becoming more obvious by the day that A) the Anti-federalists were correct, B) that any form of democracy will devolve to vote-buying by the richest lobbyists, and, C) – that ultimately, Hoppe is correct (Democracy: The God that Failed). As long as office holders are willing to give-away our future to get elected and re-elected, the popular vote will be deleterious to a free and prosperous future. A hereditary monarchy, OTOH, with a family doing its best to preserve the nation’s natural and man-made capital – and with a much longer time horizon than the next election, one of generations rather than two years – will govern far better than a badly-educated population of selfish, low-IQ, low-info voters…

        I just saw this tweet from some congressman named Brandon Gill.Mass migration is this generation’s single most pressing issue.By bypassing the Senate’s 60 vote threshold, OBBB gives Republicans unprecedented border security and deportation funding WITHOUT negotiating with Democrats, who invariably demand amnesty.That alone is the win of the century.What are we getting?– Full construction of the border wall– 900 miles of river barriers– Upgraded technology to detect smugglers and drug traffickers– Billions of dollars for Border Patrol– 10,000 new ICE agents– Detention capacity for at least 100,000 aliens per day– $20 billion for the Coast Guard to help secure our watersThe bill full secures the border and provides resources for over 1 million deportations a year.And it has no amnesty, no path to citizenship, nothing Democrats want.No President has EVER been able to deliver a win that big.

        Disclaimer: I oppose this huge state spending.  Starve the beast.  That said,I suspect the spend-fest will have less immediate impact on the dollar than many predict.   It can’t be likened to either Weimar nor Zimbabwe – in those cases the regimes had debt problems denominated in something other than their own currency.  Weimar printed marks to buy reparation gold.  Zimbabwe owed in dollats IIRC, or backed their scrip with a fixed, known supply of dollars that made the value math easy.I look at recent price rises, especially during Covid, and supply constraints make more sense as an explanation, just like the recent egg price craziness.  Restoring production mitigates those problems fast.  Housing is crazy now due to increased demand from the immigrant hordes, from foreigners buying escape houses, and Blackrock.  Until we either crush those demand sources or increase building that problem will remain.The rich have an unlimited appetite to horde dollars and financial assets, and only so much consumption.  The grasping hands eager to build dollar savings are without number.  Demand will be sustained.

            Egg prices rising is due to the hype of the chicken flu, and the deliberate slaughter of tens of thousands of chickens.  Not happening in Canada and Mexico, fwiw.  Housing supply is the biggest in five years and there are far more sellers than buyers.  And overall house prices are not dropping.  Demand cannot be sustained when people are broke/bankrupt.  The only ones who profit are the bankers . . . and the repo man.

        I don’t know if there will be a re-ordering. Yes the Oligarchs are serious, and they view the burgeoning “Democracy” of the ever expanding Managerial bureaucracy as a direct threat because it is a direct threat. BACKERS of the Dems got the same treatment Musk got from Trump. The back of the hand: Ackman, Marc Andreesen, Zuck, Bezos, etc.The GOP can’t and won’t rein in the bureaucracy (that was what DOGE was all about) because they ARE the bureaucracy. Mitch, Thune, Cornyn, all the rest are the swamp. Their friends, cronies, backers, are all the Managerial swamp that aims at destroying the Oligarchs the way the Party did Jack Ma in China.More than likely, Trump and Vance get impeached, convincted, and Hakeem Jeffries rules for China Inc. North America becomes one giant Global slum run by Xi Xinping.

        The Musk / Trump feud is due to the deficit spending. It would never change and can never change because the Uniparty will not allow it. Courts will not allow it. Press will not allow it. Permanent Bureaucracy will not allow it. Trump probably did not know about the CIA blowing up Russia’s nuclear bombers, he does not have real power.Even Democratic Presidents not senile don’t have real power. If Obama had tried to stop the CIA waging War against Russia, they would have removed him.Musk is a guy who bought into rah-rah America, and reform, and thought it was possible. It is not and will not be possible. Everyone in Byzantium knew reform was required. And no one could go against the bureaucracy and powerful court figures particularly the Empresses. Everyone in the Ming Dynasty understood that naval power was essential to hedge against land threats and would increase the power of the nation and court. Yet Zheng He was executed and his fleet burnt and sunk.A bureaucratic, feminized system is one in which the energies of various “captains” like a Cortez or Musk cannot be used effectively against enemies and are instead suppressed. Musk and other oligarchs see the threat of deficit spending which will either make their home currency worth far less, or require great wealth seizure from them neither of which is appealing to them. But Mitch McConnell, Nancy Pelosi, her lawn jockey Hakeem Jeffries, Jasmine Crockett, AOC, Bernie, judges in various districts, Bernie, and the media will countenance any changes.What helped the West was that its court systems were young, and not yet bureaucratized to the point where a Columbus, a Cortez, a Pizarro, a Magellan, could and did conquer enemies and bring great wealth to their rulers. Later, new and younger courts in Britain and the Netherlands used the same system of captains: Cook, Drake, Nelson etc. against their enemies to great success.I think at this point Trump is not going to last the Summer before President Harris or Jeffries takes office.

        AI can be used to scan these giant porkulus bills to find out what’s in them before they pass, per Nancy. So there is that.But really, Trump is a lame duck. With the margin in the House, its a race between a District Court Judge removing Trump and Vance and installing Kamala or Jasmine Crockett, and the new Dem House and Senate impeaching and convicting both and installing President Hakeem Jeffries and VP Jasmine Crockett.The “White Man” problem will be solved by the draft (taking men up to age 60 or beyond as in Ukraine) and sending them to the Russian Front. The War there MUST continue so the ascendant powers can solve their White man problem.Power, real power, does not lie with Trump, or Musk, or the Oligarchs.Real power first and foremost lies with Judges who can run the nation’s policy. Unchecked save by their cronies which means unchecked.Secondarily power lies with the propaganda media. Who are part and parcel of the managerial state.The final part of power lies with HR Karens and the rest of the managerial state. This is why entertainment cannot feature straight White men, but must always featuer gays and Girl Bosses. Since that is where the real power of the Managerial State lies — Karen from HR. This is why Girl Boss Katie Hobbs has vetoed a bill in AZ prohibiting Chinese companies from owning controlling interests in farmland or land near military bases. Its why a District Court Judge issued an injunction preventing the deportation of the Boulder Colorado molotov thrower’s family (also here illegally) and why the media has sob stories about his family. Its why Hakeem Jeffries is doxxing ICE agents, with impunity.Musk and the rest of the Oligarchs will get the full Jack Ma treatment or worse. The HR Karens neither forgive nor forget.The system IS stable. It can run on forever. South Africa will stagger on after the last White is killed, by Chinese and Indian labor. The same will happen here. It will be less able, but its not as if any outside threat can overthrow it. By the standards of the powerful, what me worry? Putin can’t even protect his own bomber force, Ukraine will roll into Moscow tomorrow or the day after by their thinking. [Yes they are stupid, but they can be stupid longer than you can stick around]. That’s why Baghdad Bob lasted so long. Until Chinese tanks run into the HR Karens nothing will ever, ever change.

        The Republican party cannot be entirely blamed for its lack of spine. We’re living in a left wing dominated world that is hostile to free speech, hostile to individual initiative. To operate in the shadow of such an umbrella takes guts, and politicians as a class are not known for their moral courage. The best one can hope from the Republicans is that they get taken over and transformed by men of vision. It has to be a man, because the chances of a woman leading the charge are zero.

Greta’s back in the news today [apparently she’s gonna go all Joan of Arc on the j00z].
For the longest time, Greta looked like she was only about 9 years.
But suddenly, almost overnight, she’s starting to look like she’s a perimenopausal 49-year-old.

I’m very very worried about her.
