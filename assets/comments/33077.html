        The British had an aircraft in WW2 that was largely made of wood: the Mosquito. It was the most versatile warplane ever, seeing service as a light bomber, for marking targets, reconnaissance, maritime patrol, special operations, night fighter, and who knows what else. It was a beloved aircraft.

        Argentina: strikes and protests? Big deal. I’ve only a passing knowledge of its history, but it’s a turbulent one. As with many Latin American nations, they tend to hyperinflation their currency every few decades. A U.S. backed regime “disappeared” thousands of citizens, granted they were Leftists, Socialists or Communists, as recently as the 1980s. I wish Mr. Milei the best of luck, but history says otherwise. And the final sad commentary: Argentina is (was?) largely a nation of European ancestry, yet its entire history has been one of instability and bloodshed. That rather demolishes the myth that Europeans are always neat, polite and civilized.

            Argentina is indeed the exception among white countries for being unstable and poorly run. Now find us the exception among negro countries that is stable and well run.

        Why are the jews (lower case mine) never mentioned about causing death and misery in this world. They’ve been kicked out of 109 countries. Let’s make it 110! I’m proud to be antisemitic and sick and tired of these warmongers controlling our world.It’s 110° – Bad Harvest

        Fukuyama:(Trump) has deepened an already substantial polarisation within society, and turned the US from a high-trust to a low-trust society; he has demonised the government and weakened belief that it represents the collective interests of Americans; he has coarsened political rhetoric and given permission for overt expressions of bigotry and misogyny; and he has convinced a majority of Republicans that his predecessor was an illegitimate president who stole the 2020 election.I just don’t understand this. How could a Fukuyama liberalism be broken except by military? His is a spiritual like politics: if the people the system introduces something it’s good, because good is what the people want.im surprised he opened his mouth. He’s proving the failures of liberalism if it could produce its own end

        ( referencing the Friedman video: It’s amazing how Thomas Jefferson’s outsized hatred of monarchy’s has persisted even until today; that the word dictator, which was a part of the ancient worlds govt, is also triggering, and that “the people” are the source of good decisions and good leadership is never questioned and held as obvious! When did this happen? Who has bewitched the west that we can’t even budge from mass democracy’s and representative govt?)In his huge list of proponents and carriers of the “open” society Rr Reno in strong gods spends a lot of time on Friedman . Even more interesting and unknown to me was hayek who I guess shockingly claimed that the individual choices souring a faceless impersonal economy would mollify the violent urges or the blonde beast, so “becer again” would the white man rise as white man and be mean.it wasn’t just that Hayek was claiming a free economy based on individual preferences was good for a people, he saw it as a social engineering project to stave off nationalism

Both absurdities continue to astound me. I can no more see why one would want to be a slave of kings or representatives. One would have thought political science would have advanced a bit by the time we created spacecraft, but we are still stuck with political concepts millennia old.
