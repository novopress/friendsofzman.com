        Anyone want to bet against the vast majority of ODD accusations being leveled against boys?

        The side “benefit” for drugging school children for these alleged disorders is that they become compliant, perfect vessels for Leftist indoctrination under the guise of education.

        “Symptoms include questioning authority, negativity, defiance, argumentativeness, and being easily annoyed.”  Isn’t that the description of being a MAN.  But they removed homosexuality as an illness.  Go figure.

        In the minds of the Cult, all conservatives are ODD. This is the first step toward putting us all in internment camps.

        My understanding is that the real motivation for the classification of these syndromes is for medicare/medicaid.   You have to be able to fill in the blank. This leads to all kinds of scam artists working the system.  the other problem with much of the terminology in Psychiatry uses common words (anxiety, depression, manic) rather than the latin/scientfic terms found in surgery or biology.  A clinically depressed person had some serious brain chemistry/neural programming problems, while lots of people have regular normal bad days.   Classic talk therapy is out of favor but newer functional techniques like Cognitive behavioral therapy work with and without drugs to reset defective brain programming.It might not be a bad idea to rename all these serious mental illness problems by latin-technical names to distinguish them from regular emotions.

        If Lou Gehrig could rate his own disease, ODD sounds a natural for Alexander Solzhenitsyn.
