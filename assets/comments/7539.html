        This is partly because people are so illiterate about history. They don’t have anything to compare to the present. When you hear people babble on about how scary things are now, it seems sort of odd if you lived through the late 60s. People have been brainwashed into thinking of the 50s as a terrible time, without understanding what a wonderful time it was compared to now. They can’t see how far Left the Dems have gone, because they have no understanding about how centrist the old Dems were.We are headed back to total illiteracy in a big way. We don’t even want to deal with text any more. Just show us some pictures and we are good. In the past, we educated people to be aware of the historical timeline, so that they could compare that with the present point in time. I sometimes think we could get rid of all schools and kids would be educated about as well as they are now.

            illiteracy crossed with amnesia.  I grew up among many first gen kids of Cuban exiles. Most of the men in my family had been to war against truly evil people (Nazis, N. Koreans, VC).  Working in a quantitative business, had a lot of Brezhnev era Russian emigres as colleagues.  Current next door neighbor was a member of the first post Communist Albanian government.  These folks were (are) always good for a reminder of just how evil and soul crushing these regimes were.  Try to describe that to a 20 year old and you might well be talking about the Cretaceous period.  They simply have no clue that transgender bathrooms is not a human rights issue on par with the Soviet Gulag.  So Uncle Bernie just seems like a great guy…

        “All of a sudden, the normals appear to have simply let go of it.”This.  30 years ago it was possible to be a working-class union type Democrat and ignore some of the party leaders flirting with the loony fringe.  In the past decade that loony fringe completely took over the national DNC and essentially told the working class types to get lost.  They have better victims to champion so white men need not apply.Of course they let go, nobody in national leadership identifies with the working class (besides Jim Webb who would have been a mainline Dem 30 years ago and is now a dinosaur on their fringe).  What is a blue-collar guy worried about his job supposed to think of a political party who’s main concern is getting trannies into ladies room and importing poor Muslims?

        I don’t know about Austria and Britain, but I think Sanders’s success in America comes from simply having a vision.  Sure, “party like it’s 1909” is ridiculous, but at least he has a clear idea of what he wants the country to look like and can articulate it.  (Hillary, meanwhile, answers the question “why do you want to be President?” with either “because it’s my turn!” or “shut up, peasant!” depending on the audience).  Trump can also tap into a clear vision.  The NASCAR-watchin’, beer-chuggin’, gun-totin’, flag-wavin’ redneck is the standard American caricature all over the world… but since the Left has controlled the culture for half a century now, they can no longer articulate why that’sbad.Nor can they articulate just why it’s so great to be a latte-sipping metrosexual with an ironic hipster tattoo.  Trump simply says “those are your choices; pick.”  It completely fries the Left’s circuits, so they run to the only clear options on offer — either Bernie’s Gilded Age lunacy or the transsexual nonsense.

        Note how in this controlled media environment, there is always a “far”, “hard”, or “extreme” Right – but these modifiers are never applied to the Left, the presumption being that everyone else is Left.

            Yes. The political media are always talking about “right wing” this, and “right wing” that. But the only time you ever hear of a “left wing”, the story is about an airplane.

        Politicians are now coming to the realization that they don’t quite have the influence they once did which may be why we are seeing a sudden change in behaviour. As global corporations continue to expand and disengage from their home-countries (Ford, GE, VW, Siemens, Shell, etc.) they also disengage from local politics. Where giants like Ford in the US and Krupps in Germany once held sway over their indigenous politicians, that is less and less the case. When they move operations from the US to China, they reduce the local workforce and effectively cut the legs out from under the local unions who had a lot of influence on local and national politicians.Western leadership everywhere is simply unable to deal with the shifting sand beneath their feet. The foundations they grew up with and relied upon as a power base have shifted and they are trying to repair their broken ox carts with technology they can’t even comprehend. The same thing happened when the Romans pulled out of Britain. They left behind technology the locals could no longer maintain or even understand and it wasn’t long until villas were turned into pig stalls.

        The re-election of obama told us all we need to know about the mental state of the American voter.  The sad fact is that many many people who should know better, have bought into the progressive mindset.  So I will hunker down and wait for the system reboot to finish.

            2012 is instructive for a different reason. Obama was a known quantity and therefore the “safe choice” for most voters. My back of the envelop math says Democrats should top out at 48% of the vote in a typical election. That’s assuming they run an amiable black guy thus goosing up the black vote. But, Obama was the easy choice if you had doubts about Romney or you just did not care a whole lot about Romney or Obama. That was enough to tilt the election for Obama.There’s little doubt that Romney would have done less damage than Obama, but that’s not always obvious to voters who don’t pay a lot of attention to details.It’s also why I suspect Trump gets 52-53% of the vote in November. Hillary is top limited at 48% and is the high risk choice.

                Romney kept a lot of conservative voters home on Election Day in 2012. When the guy who invented ObamaCare is going up against the guy who implemented ObamaCare, there pretty much isn’t any reason to bother voting. Never mind the fact you had a Mormon going up against a Muslim. Mormons might not blow you up like a Muslim would, but they give most normal people the creeps because their religion is a retarded mishmash of ridiculous bullshit. All in all a perfect storm that ensured Obama’s re-election.Hillary is despised by a good fraction of the liberal voters, and every single conservative voter. Independents who don’t like Trump will just stay home, or maybe waste their vote on Gary Johnson. I’d be surprised if Hillary even gets to 48%. That’s why I think the democrats are going to throw her under the bus before the convention and try to pull the old switcheroo.

                    I know more than a few Evangelicals who would not vote for a Mormon. They call it a cult. Some estimates put the number of white not voting over the last election at 6 million, but that’s in dispute. Still, I know a lot of white guys who threw in the towel in the Bush reign.

            The electing of part-time drama teacher and full-time feckless nitwit Justin Trudeau tells you all you need to know abut the mental state of the Canadian voter.  Unfortunately for Canada, there are no term limits for the prime minister, so the feckless nitwit Justin Trudeau may have enough time to finish the job of destroying Canada that his jackass father Pierre started.  A system reboot in Canada could be a long way off, and possibly too little too late.  Trump might have to build a northern wall to keep the Canadians out if Justin gets more than one term in office!https://youtu.be/-haG_qRjEtc

                I have seen Justin referred to as ‘a Justin Bieber wanna-be that runs Canada like a yoga class at Berkley”.We could not agree more. The fact that memories are sooooo short in this country sometimes drives us to distraction.Now we are treated to the spectacle of our PM sticking his tongue out at the Opposition during Question Period. Marvellous, isn’t it?What the world must think of us, I cannot imagine.
