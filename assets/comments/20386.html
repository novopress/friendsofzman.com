        Americans are not Euros, Z. In NYFC they set up a site where you could write in and rat out your friends and neighbours breaking quarantine and not social-distancing correctly.  The thing got taken down when it filled up with rude jokes, dink pics and insults for the leaders. NYFC is the heartland and bastion of neoliberal fuckery‚Ä¶ and if such tactics won‚Äôt work there, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll work anywhere else. I think it was California (another neoliberal bastion) where they filled up the skateboard parks so that zit faced teens wouldn‚Äôt ride their skateboards and spread the fake plague. The locals came back and shredded the park with dirt bikes, and then dug all the sand out and it was business as usual.Sometimes that black pill wears off, and you still see elements of Old America crop up.üòäüëç

            Though in the Sacramento protest yesterday, Gauleiter Newsom called out Reserve Battalion 101, who faithfully hauled off three dozen protesters for ‚Äúnot social distancing‚Äù.  Not assaulting officers, not vandalizing property‚Ä¶just standing there.  That‚Äôs more peaceful people in one day than they‚Äôve racked up in all the anti-fa nonsense.

                There are sizable  protests in at least twenty states which given that like 20  states are not locked down is really quite a lot.
Also somebody in  St. Louis leaked the snitch line in that city and given the type of place that is, some snitches are going to get stitches.

            Thanks, I was just about to write a similar post but I will just riff off what you wrote.Interestingly, I have been morewhite pilledin the last 2 weeks than anything else. We all knew that the Junior Stasi League and the Informer Brigade would rise to the occasion of ratting neighbors and becoming petty tyrant scolds. What we did NOT know was that Joe Normie would get off the couch in such large numbers and push back.Apparently, unemployed, frustrated (and soon hungry) is enough to light a fire under even the most apathetic. I saw protests across the entire country and in Michigan I saw very serious looking heavily armed white males standing inside a government building while very anxious state police looked on. Probably for the first time in a long time being reminded that the ‚Äòmountain of guns‚Äô is out there and can be deployed at a moment‚Äôs notice.I was beaming with pride like a proud papa seeing Michigan folks armed to the teeth in public. Fear and pain, these are our God-given educational tools. Armed men are stark reminders that we can dispense both en masse at a moment‚Äôs notice if we summon the will.The other knock-on effect is that the mask has now slipped completely on what the end game and attitude of the radical left is. They have shown they want to build a Soviet style state with great enthusiasm. So you either continue to support this knowingly or you don‚Äôt. The battle lines are becoming much more clear.

            Don‚Äôt split the white world like that. Europeans have their issues here but so do Americans. Besides, for a Canuck to root on Americans like that is terribly beta, ie low-status, low-testo male. It‚Äôs like the chickenshit standing behind the street fighter, tooting his horn. Don‚Äôt do that, if Europe dies America, not to mention very unimpressive Canada, probably will too.

        Lefty targeted the military at an early stage after WW2. By the fifties, it had become racially integrated. By the eighties, women were being brought in. By the nineties, homosexuals began to make noises in the ranks. By the Obama regime, sexual perverts were fully protected and served openly. Our military was subjected to modern cult-Marx techniques to assure there could never be a military revolt. Today, our military bases around the world spread the disease to every corner of the planet.

                    IMO  and STEM exempted (at least till we get STEM academies instead of colleges and universities) no one with a university education should have any office of import and all officers should be promoted from enlisted ranks only.That way you  get a fighting focused  force and an officer core that is less detached from regular folks.This won‚Äôt stop all the nonsense, Bill Gates like many techies  was  a college dropout but its a start.The solution for bigger problems is an income cap. One hundred percent tax on any income stocks included over 100x the minimum wage no inflation adjustmentThis is roughly the 1950‚Äôs era taxation without loopholes.Its generous, my personal preferjnece would be 500k per year (25x) so essentially there is no upper class but that is probably too low.Policy like this  ensures you no longer have mega rich people and its harder to espouse policies and run away from the consequences.

                        I have an extensive STEM pedigree in electrical and computer engineering. Most of my colleagues have no interest in participating with politics, they simply accept the popular, easy line and get about building useful things and tweaking their home robots, cars and airplanes. We need vocational training for both scientists and engineers beginning with separate academies at age 14, when the effects of puberty on a kid start exhibiting. Puberty is a real game changer, and those who tend to succeed in hard STEM disciplines typically experience delayed puberty. Not all, but most.

                        Good luck raising capital to create businesses and wealth when nobody has it.  90% tax rates and no loopholes to keep people from getting rich, and sending the receipts to HUD and the UN?  Brilliant.  Why work?  And what exactly did Bloomberg buy with his 500 million?  Massive capital destruction.  On a previous post you spoke of morality.  The only moral economic system is capitalism.  It just needs to be controlled to protect the air, water, and soil.  You can‚Äôt have a safety net for the truly helpless without wealth creation.

        Left-wing totalitarianism is the best argument for right-wing authoritarianism.
In the long run it‚Äôs going to be one or the other. The center literallycannothold. Either it‚Äôs their boot on our neck or our boot on their neck.
Right-wing authoritarianism will be better for its advocates, sure, but also almost infinitely better for regular people, being a program much more consistent with human nature.

            Babe ‚Äì authoritarianism is exclusively on the Left side of the political spectrum; the far right are anarchists who want no govt controls whatsoever. ‚ÄúRight wing‚Äù authoritarianism‚Äù doesn‚Äôt exist. You‚Äôre falling into the trap the Left concocted in the 1940‚Äôs labeling Hitler ‚Äúright wing‚Äù after he attacked the Soviet Union. Nazism is only ‚Äúright wing‚Äù to the full blooded communist BC it has a nationalist bent. As heard/seen in Germany during that time, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want high bread prices, we don‚Äôt want low bread prices, we want National Socialist bread prices!‚ÄùCommunism/Nazism are/have always been two sides of the same coin; under Communism the State owns the means of production, under Fascism (Nazism) the State dictates the means of production while leaving industry nominally in private hands. Witness how China morphed from a communist state thru the 1950‚Äôs/60‚Äôs/70‚Äôs/80‚Äôs to the fascist state it is today. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúCommunist China‚Äù, but it‚Äôs communist in name only. Same thing with North Korea, they‚Äôve both gone ‚ÄúCINO‚Äù.They chucked true communism long ago.

            Aside from the imposed agenda, the right becomes emotionally tied to ‚Äòsocial issues‚Äô for the same instinct as the left:
Opportunities for virtue signaling.

Abortion evil! Abortion bad! We need more Black babies born to single mothers!
Abortion is wrong but in the USA it certainly is one of the last things on my list that should be banned. Abortion in Canada, however‚Ä¶ where untold millions of white babies were aborted through the 70s, 80s, 90s‚Ä¶ is just sickening to think of. Now that we are getting more ‚Äúdiverse‚Äù, we‚Äôre finding that our mud people have even more issues using contraception than whites (just like USA ‚Äì could there be a pattern???)

                    I‚Äôm pro abortion for the most part but without social issues like abortion, marriage and all the rest there is no purpose for the Right.Why bother existing if you don‚Äôt stand for some kind of moral creed?  The supposed Rights unwillingness to do that puts them at a huge disadvantage vs the Left who as whack as it is, has a distinct moral system,All the Right does is debate economic systems . Fine when the alternative was actual Communism but there days its just a debate on how much oligarchy and how much social democracy.Its a Potemkin argument  full of sound and fury signifying nothing.Other than some Maoist or other totalitarian nonsense, economics is unimportant , fertility especially White fertility and a moral system and yes economic one hat encourages stable families is what matters.Any political system that doesn‚Äôt lead to 2.2 White  TFR is utterly useless.

                            The Black TFR is only a tiny bit higher than the White TFR and well below replacement.With higher homicide , infant mortality and incarceration rates, its probably lower than Whites overall.Also in the old days most people grew up on farms and barring economic issues, there was a steady demand for laborThis is not the case in 2020.Fundamentally any right wing solution will have to take current situations into account and will largely have to lock out older solutions.Be here now, current year whatever mantra you like but make sure you are ware of the situations.Its not only not 1920 its not even like 1970.

                I get it that you are making fun of people who think that our only problem is jewish ethnocentric power, but do you deny that it is one of our major problems?
Some want to say that the main problem is just liberalism.  But liberals are not a monolith.  Peter Brimelow recently said, I‚Äôm paraphrasing, ‚ÄúIn the 1960s white radicals were rebelling against their parents but jewish radicals were carrying on their parents‚Äô work.‚Äù

            Yes, but only post-Soviet communism. I grew up during the cold war when the political paradigm was about either advancing or blocking Soviet communism.
With the collapse of the Soviet Union, a new enemy had to be found: Nazis!! I do agree with zman that it really is about preventing the rise of competing ideologies.

                Generalisimo Franco was probably the last one, and even then he compromised a lot to not be ignored by the West, such as allying with neocon Opus Dei while lowering Falange‚Äôs visibility, and letting the neocon Bourbon line return to the throne and install ‚Äúparliamentary democracy‚Äù instead of the traditionalist-populist Carlist line that would have continued the Caudillo‚Äôs work.

        You have to wonder what took these mini despots so long to find the emergency powers angle. Works better than any radical could have hoped for . Still probably unconstitutional for states and U.S., but so what, no court is going to shut it down.Those brave businesses like the restaurant/brewery in Maine said they were going to defy their Karen governor and made it national on Tucker‚Äôs show. Yesterday I heard the health dept. and licensing dept. either shut them down or worse.Anyways, right now I see three kids playing in the neighbors driveway, got to do my duty.,

        I predict that future historians will estimate that the tipping point was passed sometime in the 1990s or early 2000s. That was when affluence-driven parasitic behaviors began a vicious cycle expansion to majority status. From that point on, all else became inevitable. You cannot talk a parasite into changing his/her need to feed. Observe, analyze, predict, and prepare. The reality freight train is coming down the track.

            I‚Äôve often placed the inflection point as the 1992 election. Ideology always makes room for the vulgar and crude, as long as it furthers the cause. The Left saw Clinton as closing the door on the past, so they were unwilling to consider the massive personal corruption and deviant behavior.

                1992 is as good a place as any and better than most.
It did not seem so to me at the time but I think now this was the great Zig when we should have Zagged:  end of the Cold War (and History) with a (now clear) win for the PRC, the electoral defeat of a fighter pilot by a draftdodging boomer rapist, the party of FDR becoming the party of Goldman Sachs, the signing of the  Maastricht Treaty, etc.

            The beginning of the end came with the rise of the New Left (Frankfurt School, critical theorists) in the 1960s. The publication of the Port Huron Statement in 1962 is a good terminus ante quem. Soon thereafter we got Hart-Cellar and the Civil Rights Acts. It was all over but the crying at that point, although we can certainly point to Bush‚Äôs ‚Äúkinder, gentler‚Äù conservatism as a torpedo amidships the U.S.S. Manhood and conservatism in general. Having said that, Coronageddon is America‚Äôs death knell. This country is finished. America no longer exists. We live in a polity that continues calling itself the USA, no more and no less. Future historians will point to the present as America‚Äôs vanishing point.

                I agree, in that I have gotten way too blackpilled in the last couple months. As a result, I‚Äôve quit flying my US flag, will no longer engage in any discussions about muh Constitution, etc. The country is dead and there is no longer any point in considering it.
Now, the only real questions are: What is next? How do we prepare for it? How can we survive the changes? How do we protect our families?

                    I‚Äôve mentioned this before, but I place US flag stamps on the envelopes upside down to signal my contempt for what‚Äôs become of this country and those who engineered its demise. As to the future, I believe our only hope lies in secessionist movements and I will direct my energies into helping secession transpire in the manner most advantageous to our people.

                Have to agree. Others claim the USA‚Äôs turning point was on November 22, 1963. Even a half century later, there are people who apparently believe it WASN‚ÄôT a conspiracy, perhaps because to allow a conspiracy calls into question cherished world-views about how our country, the world, is supposed to operate.  I‚Äôm no conspiracy nut, but the Deep State is nothing new, and there probably always have been powerful interests working in the shadows.

            Early 90‚Äôs things ratcheted up another level.   Acceptance of public vulgarity jumped. You started seeing and hearing things on TV and movies that weren‚Äôt acceptable before.  Howard Stern was looked up to as the heroic vulgarian ripping through traditional airwave norms.  There was a movie hailing Larry Flynt and Hustler as free speech idols.   There was Clinton.  It‚Äôs one thing to have a side-thing while President.  It‚Äôs another to stick a cigar in an intern in the oval office.  What a tacky scuz.  On the political side, this is when Buckley ruined the chances of a Buchanon presidency.  A chance for a true conservative, and true patriot‚Ä¶and who of all people crush it?  The nominally ‚ÄúMr. Conservative‚Äù himself, Buckley.   This is also the period where the longstanding Zionist Neo-Cons vs. Paleocon battle at National Review boiled to the surface publically.  And Neo-Con was allowed to win.  On the race side, you had with Rodney King the weaponization of all the Rodney Kings after him.  On the gay issue, the movie Philadelphia came out around ‚Äô94.  Setting the tone on the issue forevermore.  Stand with the gays and you‚Äôre good.  Against the gays, and you‚Äôre bad.  Cult of Diversity hit 5th gear in early 90‚Äôs.  This was the first time where college presidents‚Äô welcome speeches were dominated by diversity talk / tolerance demands / no free speech here threats.

        ‚ÄúIdeologies can get along just fine without a Utopian vision, but they must always have an opponent.‚ÄùSounds like ‚Äúnegative identity‚Äù might just be useful to dissidents after all.Revolutions are oppositional movements.  Positive identity is necessary to build a replacement society but negative identity is necessary to first gain the power to build it.  There is no political action without reaction ‚Äì no movement toward something new that isn‚Äôt a step away from an existing option.We criticize conservatives here all the time for being all disposition, no destination.  The main reason they fail to conserve anything is their lack of negative identity.There is nothing they hate quite enough to make them take a stand.‚ÄúThe political class operates a racket, the media runs a cult and woke capital systematizes the whole thing.‚ÄùUnless you first hate this System‚Äôs racketeering cult, you‚Äôre not going to want the power to build an alternative society,  much less be willing to fight for it ‚Äî to say nothing of actually winning.Changing public opinion is about defining what you hate as much as what you love.

            Hate is underappreciated.  We need not merely define what we stand for and present the future we envision; that future needs to be shown in clear opposition to the present or the future the other side claims to have on offer.  Yet another reason looking to the past (as in the ‚Äô50s) gets us nowhere ‚Äì since the approved ‚Äòhates‚Äô were communism and nazism.  Since we are in the demographic age, both the positive and negative aspects of identity need to be based on demographics.  We can both show what we hate as well as whom and what we love.

            Most of the so-called conservative movement is little more than controlled opposition and has been since Buckley‚Äôs time.
And BTW the Left does have a opponent contrary to what Z writes and this is the White race whom the Left wants to genocide and makes it  quite clear in writings and speeches.

Muh feminist history teacher loved that story, she thought it was badass. I suspect the Indians misunderstood something: she was basically saying: ‚ÄúOkay, guys, you‚Äôve won fair and square. Come get it!‚Äù

He was saddened by all the hungry people in his country, so one day he announced his desire to eradicate poverty in his country and to that end, he invited all the paupers to a feast in one of his castles.
As they were filling their lazy guts with his meat and his wine, he blocked the gates from the outside and burned the castle to the ground.
Hey, presto! No more poverty!

                        No, it won‚Äôt work for us in the U.S. We cannot reproduce rapidly enough to overtake the imports and irresponsible or enemy breeders if the means to support fecund numbers are jerked out from under us by our own females. When you are a solid engineer but cost too much and so 2-3 pahjeets replace you and bring their families here. When a hypocritical negress locks you in your own home and you agree to stay there but 2.5k hymies can gather together in tight places unopposed except for rhetoric.Game over. And, no, that‚Äôs not despair it‚Äôs moving on to the acceptance of the facts stage.Follow up:  I initially interpreted your link to mean you want us to make more white babies and by doing so this will reinstall us to the seat of power in our former nation.

                            Here‚Äôs an example: english canada experienced a massive Irish immigration in the 1800s. French canada had almost none. Terrified of being overrun by the english speaking people they had extreme fertility: an average French woman was having 7 or 8 babies.
They STILL lost demographic ground to the english, though kept enough to stay relevant politically.
Right now whites have a fertility of 1.4 and are experience mass non white immigration.

            The lolberts who actually cared about freedom and issues like free association, gun rights, and free speech have mostly drifted over to our side or are heading that way.  The ones who were mainly about muh weed still call themselves libertarians but have mostly been co-opted by the globalists and the Left.  Once the mainstream Democrats got on the legal weed wagon it was possible to see just how shallow the political philosophy of the typical libertarian was.  They are now fully integrated into the Establishment while pretending opposition to it.  Z‚Äôs segment in this week‚Äôs podcast about Amash was a good window on what these guys are now about which is being a stalking horse for the Never Trumpers.

        Some small input on Mr. Kubitschek: He is not a politician and not even an AfD member, but the founder and owner of the small but influential Antaios publishing house. For over a decade now, Antaios has served as an essential platform for Germanophone right wing intellectuals, with a strong focus on (revisionist) history and political theory (of the serious kind, in the Aristoteles-de Tocqueville-Schmitt-Huntington tradition, so to speak). By now, its impact has become strong enough to make Kubitschek a target for the authorities.Before he founded Antaios roundabout fifteen years ago, Kubitschek served as an officer ‚Äî low-ranking, but still ‚Äî in the Bundeswehr. It appears that his experiences in the Balkans, in the aftermath of the Yugoslav Wars of the 90s, were transformative for him.Kubitschek has also written himself, as well as been an effective (and eminently reasonable) public speaker, at Pegida gatherings for instance.Also, he appears to be on close personal terms with Bj√∂rn H√∂cke, whom the establishment in trying to make into the dark icon and scarecrow of ‚ÄúNeo-nazism.‚Äù Some argue the Kubitschek is the intellectual force behind H√∂cke, but in my view that‚Äôs simplistic. H√∂cke, though not quite Kubitschek‚Äôs match intellectually, is too much of his own man for that to be the case. But certainly the two exchange views, and pretty regularly so, I assume.Kubitschek is married, with six or so children (not sure whether they are all his, or whether his highly attractive wife, who used to very much flaunt her fertility, already brought some into their marriage). He lives in one of the remotest corners of crowded Germany, in a small village in our equivalent of Nebraska / Kansas / South Dakota.About thrice a year, low-threshold informal gatherings of ‚ÄúNew Right‚Äù sympathizers are being held there, perhaps with all who ever ordered a book from Antaios being informed via mail. In any case that‚Äôs how I learn about them, and twice I went. Essentially, I found confirmed what I had already surmised from the sezession.de website Kubitschek and his team also maintain: Namely, that he is a fine, thoughtful, and courageous man.Antifa also showed up in the village a few times, but from Kubitschek‚Äôs understated remarks about such events, it seems the villagers let them know in no uncertain terms they were not welcome. &lt;

        Thanks for a good article. I would make a small observation about one sentence in it.‚ÄúAs an aside, notice how that whole period is now officially forgotten?‚ÄùNot so much forgotten as addled by schizophrenia.On one hand there is an elaborate project documenting as much of the Stasi activities as possible. There are museums and ‚Äúinterpretive centers‚Äù displaying all manner of Stasi artifacts. People can see the files the government kept on them if they request it.  Germans saved everything they could from the Stasi archives, including a warehouse full of bagged shredded paper documents which historians are painstakingly putting back together like a huge number of jigsaw puzzles. They will be at this for years.On the other hand, there is the treatment of G√∂tz Kubitschek and hundreds like him.The irony escapes them but, excepting Nietzsche, Germans have never appreciated irony.

        Bit of a long read, but this does a good job of framing how classical leftism has adapted to the peculiarities of US society.    Explains to me how the local Proggies, whose husbands draw 6 and 7 figure paychecks from Goldman et al, can, without shame, also be the enforcers of the new social norms.  And relentlessly swarm on anyone that dares voice any dissent.  The old working class, the former stronghold of leftism, can be abandoned with no guilt and the ‚Äúself-actualization‚Äù of the 32 genders can be embraced‚Äìwith the good old hetero-cis white males as the new boogeymen.https://lawliberty.org/forum/the-strange-rise-of-bourgeois-bolshevism/

        Want to weaken their hold then play their game, at least for awhile.Fill out every gov form you can, eligible or not.Demand a cut in property taxes, sales taxes, income taxes.Demand banks, insurance and associated companies cut their fees and interest payments.Demand more and more nationalization of industries that continually work against our interests.Apply for gov work. Have a crappy job? Retired?  Want to muddle the works? Get your foot in the door.Since we are unable to organize and reorder things let us do it from the inside.  Tie them up in 1 million knots.  We still have the numbers to raise the costs to disruptive levels.Do this while maintaining and building our community.   At some point we will be organized enough and our enemies will have been weakened enough so that more direct and decisive actions can be taken.Fake it ‚Äôtil we break it.

        Z says, ‚ÄúLiberal democracy is a racket, a cult and a corporation. The political class operates a racket, the media runs a cult and woke capital systematizes the whole thing.‚Äù Previously he noted that the targets of liberal democracy are ‚Äúpopulism and nationalism.‚Äù I submit that those targets are actually fig leafs for the true target, which is the white race.

            They‚Äôve removed us straight, white, Christian males from power. You saw what they did to Kavanaugh, Flynn and Trump. Consider globalization, equal pay, affirmative action and diversity since the Soviet Union imploded combined with the destruction of white history and permanent attachment of the holocaust and grievance industries. Toss in feminism and abortion.
We have lost without firing a shot, the rest is mopping up operations and triumphalism.

        Trial by ordeal. Be willing to lose everything, and you pass the test. You‚Äôll lose a lot (not all) but gain your freedom.  Speaking from experience in my small life. Your fear is the weapon used against you.
Take the notion to a societal level. That‚Äôs what we face and what has to happen.  It sucks but I promise I‚Äôm speaking truth here. Freedom is worth it, and everything will be lost by being ruled by fear.
The best thing is, there‚Äôs no violence on your part.  All that‚Äôs needed is to not give an inch.

            There‚Äôs the saying about the bank being in trouble if it lent you too much. Who gets scapegoated in the end?  The recklessly ambitious always end up undoing themselves.
Potentially it‚Äôs a weird cutthroat symbiosis. The more the puritans retreat from the scene, the less American things look, the more the narrative breaks‚Äî then freedom.  After all, there is a place called America that isn‚Äôt an idea. Could be masterful puppeteering going on.  Making lemonade.

        Mike Enoch has been saying the system wont go totalitarian because they prefer us to just buy product and then get us excited for next product and not waste a bunch of time and energy with the iron fist. He may ultimately end up correct, but for now it appears that our glorious leaders do in fact want more control.So why was he probably wrong? I think even he, despite his laser like focus on certain elements of them, underestimated the neurosis and paranoia of our ruling class. Theyve spent millions of dollars 1000s of hours at least and untold energy to keep a small minority of whites under control. This clampdown is just a minor uptick.Selling product and making next product are under threat, who we are or our way of life, so why would it be out of the question to tighten down? If enough people understood the extent of the evil thats currently ongoing, that could be disastrous potentially‚Ä¶oh and we also have guns for now. Theyd be stupid not to react this way.Perhaps this is a temporary measure, or maybe it has nothing to do with European Americans (sigh) waking up a bit and threatening the system. But if im right then we are going to see this sort of reaction and these new powers flexed to do all sorts of relevant things to secure our leaders position more fully: climate change restrictions, gun control, speech restrictions.Some of these are easy to predict but ill say in the next 5 years we will see further crackdowns and limitations and isolation for climate change which will just so happen to benefit big multinationals and other billionaires. Gun control attacked as a corrolary to these restrictions since the mass shootings havent worked. They will tie gun control to public health or climate safety somehow. And severe freedom of speech restrictions although thats not exactly stepping out on a limb.Given the lack of meaningful opposition from the so called right wing, this is probably the most pivotal and dangerous time for us. If you can do anything to fight back, no matter how small, now is the time to act. Legally mind you. No movement exists to do it for us so we need to start the lawsuits if possible, we need to try to organize our local communities to push back against these lockdowns or at least join in, we need to help each other get into and rise the ranks inside of organizations to change them from within, call our local politicians‚Ä¶whatever something lame is better than nothing at all.Trolling and memes are great but all theyve done is draw battle lines, if no one actually shows up then those drawn lines arent actually useful.The time for trolling and racism for the sake of racism is over imo. We are in a struggle and its time to actually do something thats going to make a difference. While trolling and memeing of course.Ultimately we need to take control of something, anything. We are guaranteed to lose 100% barring a miracle while the media, academy, political parties etc sre controlled by our enemies. We are just trolling in the wind until that changes somehow.

                Its a possibility. I know nothing about them except they seem to have little power influence anymore. Since time is short we would ideally find the best bang for our buck. Anything media related is good, part of the legal system, academia are ideal. But given a lack of resources local fraternities are a start, church organizations, school organizations. Once you reach a critical mass, which requires warm bodies, you can turn your efforts in any organization towards some positive effect no matter how small. Masons could easily create scholarships that just so happen to always go to the ‚Äúright people‚Äù, or charity that associates our cause with a higher morality.Ultimately this will be won or lost on moral grounds, and we are decades behind so anything that turns the tide on that front is a big win. The moment we make the ruling class look immoral and ourselves moral, to the average person, is the moment we will look back on as the turning point. But we need our people to be in the right places when that happens or the opportunity could be lost.

We lost but alk we lost was the liberal dream of a tolerant, open society. It was always going to end poorly, and there was no hope to win.We will be a minority if we arent already. I can think of at least one tenacious and energetic minority that relentlessly worked to turn the tables in their favor. What we should learn is there is no defeat. Defeat is an opportunity to shame morally your enemies, and it doesnt mean ‚Äúgame over‚Äù, it means ‚Äútry again later‚Äù.We didnt lose, liberals lost against the people they welcomed in.

                Masons in the U.S. are nothing more than a decrepit fraternity and they have no influence yet alone power today. Fifty years ago that wasn‚Äôt the case and two hundred years ago Masonry was, in fact, a powerful community.I‚Äôve already memorized the ridiculously expansive Sigma Chi ritual. I am not jumping through hoops again to enter ‚Äúan order,‚Äù so for me Masonry is a non-starter. I‚Äôll not be dressing up in costumes going forward.You want me involved then the secret buried bunkers are constructed, the air-gapped computers calculate and teach The Plan, we rehearse on private ranges, and then we actually go out in teams and liquidate our opposition and snuff out their bloodlines. As for my awareness of or leadership in such an organization, yes we have no bananas. Nada, zilch, jack squat. Even GloboHomo with its resources just barely manages the clowns at CIA and FBI for their hits.Nothing shy of executing The Plan could work but despite our imminent erasure none of us can or will take the necessary actions. So, we wait and hope our enemies implode and we and our loved ones will be free to rebuild a new society in the aftermath. Good luck with that, there‚Äôs too much gorgeous, available land to be stolen by GloboHomo and used for their base.

                Have you seen how fat and unattractive majority of those protestors appear? They scare away the other convertible normies. Find them plate carriers that fit them and teach them not to bend over because disco scivvies expose their arsecracks when they do manage to bend over without tipping over.

You fight with the men you have not the ones you want and motivated and loyal slobs beat backstabbers by any measure.
Yes optics matter but so long as you avoid excess Nazi symbolism , it matters little.
The other side lies anyway, uses agent provocateurs and cheats at every opportunity. That can be managed . So long as a little self policing is managed and good sense is exercised, another C.Ville can be avoided.

        Another truth about democracy is that it goes bankrupt.  Power can only be projected to the individual level when the state pays a salary for someone to knock on the door of the suspected violator, and put that violator through some expensive punitive system.  When the salaries aren‚Äôt paid, no one shows up, and you‚Äôre left with a true believing cat lady from next door screaming at you with no back up.  This is where liberal democracy is going.  Thousands of draconian laws that are only lightly policed, and when they are only people who make headlines are put through the mill.  Another soviet similarity.

            One bright spot is this: there are limitations to government power. Bureaucrats are human too, with the same strengths and weaknesses as us. While bravery and courage have their place, caution and inaction are the rule.

                It works both ways though and in many parts of the world, snitches and collaborators pay a terrible price. ‚ÄúNo snitching‚Äù and ‚Äúsnitches get stitches‚Äù  was and still is a thing  in many , probably most poorer parts of the US.
As for Mexico the less said about how cartels settle that problem the better.

        Several good reminders here today, Z, thanks.The Soviets and the East Bloc nations enjoyed fairly widespread support. Their citizens were jaded and cynical and knew their governments routinely lied, but as long as there was relative peace and prosperity no one really complained. Dissidents were easily put down because Cucks and Karens were in place to do what the State generally didn‚Äôt have to do. The propaganda outlets were not expected to actually report news.All of which, of course, is the same as Lock Down America, with a very important exception. There may not be relative peace and prosperity after the current insanity ends. Look for protest giving way to outright nihilism as people decide the State isn‚Äôt worth it any longer. If you want to know why Jerome Powell is terrified (in addition to protecting his friends in the Tribe that dominates his), it‚Äôs for this very reason.

            A major trouble is we get jaded and callous. For example, I was briefly (few weeks) a fan of Colin Flaherty‚Äôs podcasts. But there are only so many ways you can report on black crime way out of proportion and the media cover-up. Before long all the stories sound alike. If he makes money reporting it, good on him, but I better uses for my time (like posting here, much to the dismay of you guys!)  ü§™The focus of the authorities and the media is always wrong. For example, in response to a USA-style mass shooting, Trudeau has banned ‚Äúassault rifles.‚Äù But I‚Äôm sure even Canada has trouble from the Melanic Hominids¬Æ:  They must murder a few dozen at least in a year but I doubt we‚Äôll see them banning immigration from the mother countries.

        The founding myths and structure of the US government, plus the need to conquer a continent gave the people some protection for several generations. But, unfortunately, the system slowly became corporatism and not laissez-faire capitalism. The great trick was to convince people that the economic system was still capitalism.Corporatism (the fascist economic system) is the fusion of the corporation and the State. A revolving door as so many talk about these days.What so many miss is that corporatism is left-wing just as socialism, only it can be much more efficient. Can be. But sooner or later the crazies will worry more about the ideology rather than the goodies. We are at that point now.The bastards running the parties now are so damn dangerous because they are following their ideology and bringing heaven to this earth. They are controlling you for your own good just as any good mother would do with a immature little child. They are playing God.We are in a mixture of ‚ÄúBrave New World‚Äù and ‚Äú1984‚Äù. We can not vote ourselves out of this mess. Voting got us here for God‚Äôs sake.

            There wasn‚Äôt any need to ‚Äúconquer a continent‚Äù but there was an opportunity, afforded principally by a real pandemic that killed off very nearly the entire indigenous population of that continent. The self-righteous Puritans, inspired by the example of Oliver Cromwell and his destruction of the English Catholics and the Irish, used their Bunyanesque theology to justify genocide and invasion. This line of thinking remains an integral part of the American psyche. Believe what we believe, do as we tell you, or we‚Äôll kill you.

Had there been no humans on the continent at all, one could still say they had to conquer a continent. For the longest time, they were preoccupied with making a Europe out of a vast woodland. Well, except my people who were the southern mountains with the natives.
Never the less, for a long time the economic system was pretty much laissez-faire capitalism, and I say out of some necessity.

            Mark ‚Äì It matters not a whit if corporatism is as ‚Äúleft wing‚Äù as socialism.

                But what if corporatism plus full democracy is the very thing keeping you from getting the demographics right in the first place?  Remember, I am old enough to have watched corporatism demolish the white majority demographics in my lifetime.
What then? Perhaps we need to get the system right. Even a King would beat the hell out of what we have now.

                This takes Conservatives too far out of the comfort zone.

                    Some people think more than others, but most people feel more than they think,  which is why advertisers, movie makers, and politicians use rhetoric and lies. So if you want to persuade someone, you must first figure out where they are on the spectrum. How much thinking do they do? Little more reason or little more rhetoric? On the other hand, if they are a better thinker than you, It‚Äôs hard, but you may have to be a little more devious. Also, don‚Äôt  confuse verbal skill with logical excellence.

        America for all her freedoms, harassed, ostracized and sometimes imprisoned people just for their speech (anti-war, socialism, communism) well into 20th century.  WW II era laws against such are still on the books but (hopefully) unenforceable. Sometimes that is lamentable, like the racially restrictive covenant on your house‚Äôs deed, if your home is very old. üòÄI love Germany, even lived there two years (does Army count?) üôÇ For all its freedoms of speech, I dare you to go there and wear Nazi imagery, speak or publish Nazi propaganda, and please report back how the authorities treat you!Now based on their history, perhaps that is a valid limitation. Certainly it is their right to set rules on their own citizenry. There‚Äôs probably a term for this, but I suspect the very effort to suppress BadThink will just lead to its popularity, or at least cult following. The rest of the West as Z has often noted, is well on the way down that road.Rewriting history: (story from a college world history class). No big surprise the Soviets would censor their own books. Even overseas editions of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia: Overseas owners received a package containing a pair of scissors, a replacement page and instructions. The instructions were to remove the entry on Trotsky and replace it with something that met current dogma.

        In a country that is rapidly losing its racial homogeneity and increasingly turning into a mega-system of diverse and contradictory  ethnic, racial and economic interests with competing narratives, there is a distinct possibility of the country‚Äôs break-up. An incipient civil war in America will become a reality when a state of emergency is declared, following some major racial riot or catastrophic terrorist attack. This is the scenario American and pro-American elites in Europe fear most. At that moment American post-democracy, similar to the proverbial clothes-less emperor, will have difficulty trying to hide its nudity. ‚ÄúA democratic society is a society which contains no real principle of unity. It does not even merit the name of society. In democracy, there can be no citizens; there are only private citizens whose occasional civic behavior does not even indicate the will to be citizens,‚Äù writes Polin. In atomized postmodern America, the nature of the social contract makes everybody suspicious of everybody and always on guard against fellow citizens.Furthermore, the dynamics of the omnipotent market forces have everybody trying to outsmart and deceive everybody. Led by an unquenchable desire that he must exclusively act on his physical environment and improve his earthly lot,Homo Americanusmust come to the conclusion that the only possible way to realize his happiness is by placing hhis material welfare and his individual well being above all other goals. He is less and less prone to abide by common values of his racial or ethnic community. Instead, he focuses his attention on no being left out of the economic battle, always thinking of his fellow citizens and of the entire system as agents wishing to cheat and rob him.Tomaslav Sunic,Homo Americanus, Child of the Postmodern Age

        One problem in Germany vs here in the U.S. is that unlike here, in Germany rights are given by the state. The German constitution has no equivalent to our 9th and 10th amendments. All rights in Germany are bestowed by the state and as such are subject to modification or even rescission if the state decides to do so. IMS, the German constitution is also easier to amend than ours. I suspect that the biggest result of an Article V ‚ÄúConvention of States‚Äù would be a much longer, much less tightly worded document with many more ‚Äúrights‚Äù enumerated but without anything like the 9th or 10th amendments. The new constitution would grant rights not guard/secure them. But I‚Äôm old so I don‚Äôt have to worry about  actually living under ta constitution which resulted from an Article V convention.

There is great evidence that Communism did not lose its deep spiritual meaning for the Russian people and Communists all over the world until Khrushchev‚Äôs speech denouncing Stalin.What must we do?Denounce the fraud of the Rule of Law, which is in truth the rule of evil, insane lawyers at every chance.The law is the real intersectionality, its the teeth and head, nervous system and claws of the enemy.  At any cost leges delendo est.
