        that is a liberal position to  take on this issue since not chaining the CPI would lead to more entitlement spending. I’m sure citizens would prefer wagu beef as well, but that’s not practical.

Sometimes some people will be happier than other.s There will always be economic winners and losers like those who can afford steak and those who cannot.
