        I remember NPR doing a little feature on Juneteenth many years ago, in the 90‚Äôs or maybe even during the 80‚Äôs.

        I know a lot of history, including black history, but had never heard of anyone acknowledging or celebrating Juneteenth until I lived in Houston about 20 years ago.  I never heard black people or any people in any other part of the country mentioning it in any way.Then, with almost no effort at persuasion or campaign against opposition (unlike MLK Day), in the blink of an eye it became a consolation prize to blacks during the Hate Whitey riots of 2020.Even now, moderate whites who are not that political, jokingly wish one another a happy Juneteenth.  The whole thing is so ridiculous, but it will no doubt be used as a cudgel to get rid of the real Independence Day before long.

        Having a bit of fun looking at the Conservatives embrace this garbage. Here is a post from Fox with some black guy who loves him sum Juneteenth.https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/why-juneteenth-american-july-4thIt is an extension of July 4th he says. Here is the deal. If the holiday commemorates the white male armies that clashed, died, were maimed and their families who lost love ones, lifetimes of productive endeavor, and the all white Americans whose taxes paid off the war bonds then maybe. However, it isn‚Äôt presented that way. Even this black guy, what is he celebrating? What black accomplishment is tied up in the day some guys in Texas were told that someone handed them their freedom?No, this is just more attempts to get rid of the founding of America and dispossess the people who created it. Remember Sambo‚Äôs? I would give anything to celebrate Juneteenth at a Sambo‚Äôs with a Sambo special.I am just so sick of the pandering to blacks and the blacks lapping it up. I think someone here today said it best. If blacks want a celebration they should have a Herbie Hancock day or something ‚Äì some accomplishment that was genuinely made by a skilled and accomplished black person.Hey whitey! You suck. Dis be our independence day. Uh, Shawnquayshonn, white people did that. You were sitting around waiting word while the battles raged. Everything is an excuse to bend the knee to black people. It is exhausting.Fox accelerates its own embrace of The Great Replacement.

        And here go, ‚ÄúConservatives‚Äù, at it again:https://www.theamericanconservative.com/the-freedom-season/Notice there is no mention of why this day is significant in our history. Reason? It has zero significance in our history. Notice the Cult of Lincoln throughout his argument. So what does he propose? Taking a day with zero political or historical significance and creating yet another weeks long, ‚Äúcelebration‚Äù, of something meaningless. It gives meaning to something meaningless, and it completely degrades that of the most significance. This guy is a total tool.The New Founding re-inforced. Is it me, or are you as tired of having our significant historical moments being defined by slavery as blacks surely must be of having their entire identity defined in relation to white people?

        Juneteenf is my new favorite holiday. I celebrate it vicariously, watching the more active celebrants pew-pew! pew-pew! pew-pew! pew-pew! to their hearts‚Äô content while I sip wine on the sidelines laughing at feral marksmanship.

            Yes, the big story I saw, linked by someone here or at Severian‚Äôs place was the one with like 25 people shot at some Juneteenf block party in Chicongo. Only 1 killed though. That is one saving grace of our black ganstas. They fire off a lot of rounds but don‚Äôt hit much of anything.

                Most of you already know this, but if you don‚Äôt, the Steve Sailor rule is that the lower the percentage of fatalities in a mass shooting, the higher the liklihood that the shooter was black.

            Anyone in a large Texas city has been familiar with Jumeteemph for a while.  The professionally black ‚Äúcommunity organizers‚Äù will arrange the city gibs for some BBQ and purple drank in a public park in a local no go zone.Free anything but education and the opportunity to publicly act a fool will attract a big crowd of blacks.  As night follows day a big crowd of blacks ends with some blacks shooting other blacks for reasons incomprehensible to anyone who can imagine how they would feel if they didnt eat breakfast.Since all their practice shooting seems to never improve their marksmanship, few or no blacks are actually killed.  YT picks up a few million dollar bill stitching up Sha‚Äôquavious at the local hospital.It is a rotten lie to say that Jumeteemph is not an authentic black holiday.  Although it was only a regional thing‚Ä¶ it is the MOST authentic black holiday there is because it has always been commemorated in the blackest possible way.

        Maybe this weekend‚Äôs ‚Äúvideos of widespread military vehicle maneuvers‚Äù in suburbs and farm country were preparations for Coonteenth?
No, wait, I got it; not to supress peaceful Purge celebrations, but for the Greatly Feared Backlash, surging mobs of gap-toothed rednecks waving their AR-15s and Confederate flags.

        Physiognomy is EVERYTHING.  Look at Hotez, Fauci, Schumer, Nadler, Waters, Pelosi, Weingarten, Frank, McConnell, Yellin. . .they tell you who they are by their face.  Don‚Äôt listen to the soyjacks  man-child with their black rimmed glasses. . .just look at their face!Their are handsome psycopaths out there like Newsome or Trudeau.  Even Biden wasn‚Äôt ghoulish looking as a young man.  Look for that shit eating grin, tho.  And in attractive women, look for those ‚Äúcrazy eyes‚Äù that that slut 1000-cock stare.The face tells all.  You CAN judge a book by it‚Äôs cover.The strong, healthy, and beautiful  or just the normal and natural MUST bully and keep down the ugly and perverse.  Because if they don‚Äôt, what is in store for them is far, far worse.  Nothing changes from grade school, the little fat shithead booger eater big mouth is tomorrow‚Äôs monster if they‚Äôre not kept in their place.I‚Äôll leave this post with a quote ironically from Woody Allen:‚Äù Don‚Äôt listento what your schoolteachers tell you.Just see what they look like. That‚Äôs howyou‚Äôll know what life is gonna be like.You heard it here first.‚Äù

            The Juiceish ones tend to have rat faces and ratlike mannerisms that indicate deceptive behavior.  Think Ben Shapiro as he talks too fast, constantly stops and twitches his nose, and grooms himself by licking his hands and rubbing them over his ears.
I feel unfair pointing it out, in reality rats are wonderful pets.  I had a pet rat and he loved to groom my beard and never once tried to talk me into getting a sex change or investing in a ponzi scheme.

                Mostly true, but I have noticed a disturbing trend among the females who show up on the internet as ‚Äúinfluencers.‚Äù  They have (quite obviously) photoshopped and surgically enhanced, albeit essentially attractive figures but their faces are masks devoid of even a hint of living, breathing flesh.  They stare at the camera, puffy lips parted (I suppose to more closely resemble the pudenda they substitute for) with big, dead eyes, their skin having the tint and texture of a silicone mask.  I guess that‚Äôs what we want, since they are so prevalent.  Unless that‚Äôs just what they want us to want.  Who knows?

        Re the Managerial Class‚Äôs (or indeed, any deluded entity) thinking that their words will somehow magically shape reality, which is or at least should be risible in itself, permit me some humor. Long ago MAD magazine did a feature that was entitled something like ‚ÄúIf comic characters had to live in the real world.‚Äù I wish I had a link to the actual strip, but the best I can offer is a retelling: In a spoof of Mandrake the Magician*. He and his friends are by their car on the side of the road, needing to address a flat tire. Someone says ‚ÄúMandrake, why don‚Äôt you just gesture hypnotically and fix the tire?‚Äù To which he responds: ‚ÄúI can hypnotize you or him or perhaps myself into thinking the tire is fixed, but how can I hypnotize the tire into thinking it‚Äôs fixed?I think this story aptly illustrates the dilemma the World-Improvers often find themselves in. Who would have ever thought a child‚Äôs humor magazine would dispense pearls of wisdom? üôÇ*Wikipedia says the strip ran for 79 years (different artists of course). That‚Äôs probably a very long run for a daily funny.

            Wow! I am not on Twitter. Here is Michelle Obama‚Äôs tweet:‚ÄúJuneteenth is a celebration of freedom‚Äîa chance to pay tribute to countless advocates, activists, and changemakers and the work they did to build a more perfect Union.‚ÄùHa! Ha! Ha! Ha! They were all white men who fought a brutal bloody war with 650,000+ killed and many more wounded to incapacity. The cost to this country that only white men paid is huge. Yet she credits advocates, activists and ‚Äúchangemakers.‚Äù The delusion of this bitter person is astounding.A bit further down you have the shameless anti-white Mark Cuban. First of all, this guy just look like he stinks because there is so much rot in his intestines from the misanthropy his entire being feeds off of to survive.In any case, the merciless and shameless greed of this guy in this post:‚ÄúWay to talk in generalities Joe.   Not saying there aren‚Äôt a lot of fucked up things about pharma.  That‚Äôs why we createdhttp://Costplusdrugs.com. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Joe , you and@elonmusk‚Äòs@ŒöœçœÅŒπŒµ Œü·ΩñœÑŒπœÇare the mainstream online media and your platforms have become everything supposedly wrong with MSM. You are driven by self interest.  Just like the MSM always has been accused of.‚ÄùIf I had Twitter I would post a chart of Broadcom‚Äôs sale price and then the cratering of its value with Yahoo a few months later and next to it a chart of Cuban becoming a billionaire as Yahoo/Broadcom tanks.This is a true clown world. I think the other day Cuban appeared at some corporate conference cheering on white replacement saying a company‚Äôs work force should look like its customers as the customers see that value, (do they ever see the employees), and blah blah blah blah. He then proceeded to display his absolute contempt for working people.Man. Thank God I don‚Äôt have Twitter.

                    I appreciate it when Anna shows up because she is such a great example of the ethnocentrism of the chosen.When she writes here, you can tell that she has never once asked herself if the critics may have at least one valid complaint.As white guys, we would at least consider the merit of criticisms against us, even if we were confident in our position, because it is in our nature to care about the truth.This is not the case with most of the chosen.  All Anna needs to know is that her people are being criticized and she unthinkingly attacks.  We need a bit more of this.

        Imagine being of a race where all your celebrations revolve around what another race did to you? Humiliating would not begin to describe it.It would be better for them as a race if they celebrated some black who actually helped them forge their own destiny instead of insisting on gibs. The narrative is that whites have no allowed blacks to do this, which is nonsense, of course, but a useful nonsense for people who want a permanent underclass as shock troops..Replace Juneteenth with Nat King Cole day or something and at least let them honor something that isn‚Äôt a racial embarrassment.

            I‚Äôm not so sure Juneteenth doesn‚Äôt have legs;  Pride Month is getting an increasing grip on the masses.  In one of my rare trips outside the routine of work to home to work, I was in the bank and they had a fruit flag on the monitor and the bank teller was wearing a rainbow pin.  The lady at the card store was wearing a rainbow pin.  The PBS classical channel had a pride segment for a lesbian composer to rant about her pride in overcoming discrimination.  And so on.And even MLK day has impacted my life:  The last two years I have celebrated black culture on MLK day by calling in sick to work.  I may make Juneteenth another occasion where the white man boycotts societally productive activity.

                My new job is remote and they gave us the day off. If it weren‚Äôt I think I might have celebrated by going in tomorrow and stealing some hubcaps in the parking lot. They don‚Äôt get enough of that kind of urban petty crime here that we used to enjoy back in Baltimore back in the day. People need to understand what they‚Äôre celebrating after all.BTW, classical music channels have an almost palpable sense of tension over all this woke shit. You can practically hear it in the voices of the announcers.  I‚Äôve taken to listening to 107.3 FM in St. Loius over audacy.com. They have their own unique spin on blackwashing things. They just have a bunch of black DJs and occasionally, they just play some random rap tune that seems topical to them rather than trying to work an actual classical music theme into current events. So last week they played that old tune by Will Smith about summertime because why not? You gonna find fault with that? Raciss!

        The average black is very far removed from whatever the ‚Äúwhite man‚Äù is thinking up in Washington. If Juneteenth was a ‚Äúreal‚Äù holiday like Black Spring Break, the brothers would be celebrating it like crazy. Since Juneteenth is not keeping it real though, nobody in the community cares. Washington can‚Äôt do anything about it.Juneteenth is another annoyance for the average white person. It‚Äôs a white guilt holiday that will be pushed on us at work and by the government, and we are supposed to feel bad. And by feeling bad, the cat ladies feel pious and righteous.Outside the managerial class, African Americans just continue to African American, the same way whites continue to white. For good and for bad. This is becoming apparent as the rulers become increasingly nutty and disconnected from reality.

            ‚ÄúEbonics‚Äù was widely mocked when it was of pseudo-academic interest in the 1970s‚Ä¶even by blacks who rightly saw it as a tacit admission that maybe the Civil Rights Act that upended and reordered society wasn‚Äôt working, and maybe never could.
Now everyone has to pretend ‚ÄúJuneteenth‚Äù is something grand, not a bastardizing of basic English from illiterate and innumerate freed slaves from hundreds of years ago.
Expect more of this, and at an accelerated pace.

                Eubonics was the turning point in action and thinking wrt Blacks and equality.  Prior to that point, the narrative was that Blacks were the equal of Whites, just a bit behind due to prior discrimination which could be solved with a bit of time, patience, and effort on the part of Whites.  Hell, even LBJ said this in an address to the nation wrt Civil Rights legislation a decade earlier.Eubonics was a tacit admission of failure and rejection of this narrative.  It was the start of a movement to lower standards to meet Black abilities, rather than raise Black abilities to that of Whites.  True, there were howls of derision from many Whites and the Black ‚Äútalented tenth‚Äù, but they did not prevail over ‚Äúobservable reality‚Äù.Prior to the Eubonics ‚Äúmovement‚Äù, AA was still innocent in effect and consider part of the movement to ‚Äúraise‚Äù Blacks to White standards.  Afterwards, AA became corrupted and associated with lowering standards for all aspects of Black ‚Äúadvancement‚Äù.  And here we are today.

                    And this is also where postmodern relativism enters the picture. If there are no objective standards of cultural and intellectual achievement, it is entirely logical to argue that substandard English is actually a valid expression of a different but equal culture. Ebonics is not inferior, it is Other. To deny this is racist.

                    Elsewhere (or perhaps it was here, who the hell can remember) I posted something along these lines: üôÇThe NAACP has recently warned blacks to not travel to Florida. They did the same to Missouri a few years back. As a resident of Florida for twenty years, I urge blacks to heed the advice. This backward state must have never heard the South lost. It‚Äôs like Jim Crow never was repealed. Civil Rights Act? Never heard of it!  I find it amazing that there isn‚Äôt ‚Äústrange fruit‚Äù hanging from every tree, to quote the ominous old 1939 Billie Holliday blues song. Frankly, I find it amazing that our population is nearly 16% black, slightly more than the national average. Why those folk haven‚Äôt high-tailed it to safer places like Detroit, Chicago, Jackson or Baltimore, I can‚Äôt fathom. Now, I know that tourism is one of our biggest money makers and we‚Äôll take a hit if you don‚Äôt come. As alluring as a vacation here might seem, your lives are far more imporant than seeing The Mouse or drinking a ‚Äú40‚Äù at the beach while you‚Äôre checking out the white pussy. Keep your black asses at home, where at least you‚Äôll be alive.

                I was an anesthesiology resident at Emory in the early to mid-90‚Äôs. One night during Freaknik I was on call on Saturday. It was an endless litany of trauma‚Ä¶.mostly stabbings. Even through all of it, we had an African-American nurse who kept repeating ‚Äúthese young people are not causing these problems. This is coming from the outside‚Äù. Which I took to mean it was White people agitating and causing these attacks, However, seeing as you didn‚Äôt see a single white person within a 15 mile radius of Piedmont Park/Ponce de leon, I found very suspect.

                Black Spring Break moved to the home of my in-laws and it was non-stop twerking by gigantic well-fed women, ragged-out cars with suspension lifts and absurd 40-inch rims (called donks), endless boom-boom-boom of jungle music and even some gunplay!
It gave the annoyed white folks down there the opening to maybe tell the organizers to take their 40-ounces and GTFO.https://www.nola.com/news/biloxi-may-restrict-black-spring-break-after-shootings/article_ec63e38c-ddf4-11ed-9c1a-6f106c2d2dfd.html

                    It should be used to celebrate and uplift white people for making such massive sacrifices of blood and money to free blacks. How they present it as a white shaming exercise shows how ignorant whites are as much as blacks.
We can end Juneteenth by trolling the hell out of it. I think we only paid off the Civil War debt a few years ago. In any case, that it works as a white shaming device at all is a testament to how badly broken our education and cultural transmission mechanisms are.

        In heavily black cities crime remains an immutable fact of life, no matter how many black holidays are created.Agreed Z, but save for the fact Willowbrook, IL is not heavily populated by A Certain Demographic, you are correct. It is in DuPage County, over 20 miles from Chiraq and Crook County. If you believe the US Census, it‚Äôs a town of &lt; 5% of A Certain Demographic. Sadly that 5%, and they friends from Da City, caused this.That said, Derbyshire&#x27;s The Talk, especially Rules 10a (Avoid concentrations of such folks who aren&#x27;t known to you) and 10d (Don&#x27;t attend events that are likely to attract large numbers of such folks) apply in this case.

In the old days you wouldn‚Äôt have an attempted car jacking in Naperville (also in DuPage County) either:

            Y‚Äôall missed your golden opportunity of living free of blinks and fear. I figured out 20 years ago working in the Oakland water company in Huey Newton‚Äôs old neighborhood, years before I actually moved, to chose, a choice, to move to Southern Mormomland to bury quietly among the blinkered up sheep guided by the prophet!  Avoid Salt Lake City which is full of California lefties and lapsed Mormon children turned fag-hag, gay or furry. You all have a visceral reaction to Mormons. Well, so do blinks! In a big superstitious way about Mormons. Ooglie-Booglie! So Mormons are geeky and reasonably benign, with the exception of Burisma Romney, his family and the state globalists-this state run by globalists. Mormons are not violent to neighbors, unless you get on the wrong side of the Avenging Angels. Gotta wear shades when I step into my whitey-white-white neighborhood and walk around my half acre, shops, garden and fruit trees. (And a view to die for of the range front fault mountains kaboom-altitude from my deck when I‚Äôm traegering up my beef.) Blinks aren‚Äôt into self-sufficiency. Far from it. Run from it like the plague. Or Marburg. Or something wicked Bill Gates comes.Afraid Mormons go goofy on their own, high use of SSRI‚Äôs and meds for anxiety, fairly high level of spousal abuse, compliant, little curiosity, and that Mormon guy that whacked his family is about 15 minutes away. They eat their own out of stress and anxiety of conforming. Am not one of them so I don‚Äôt worry about conforming. I don‚Äôt mess with them.  They don‚Äôt mess with me. Love my neighbors! Keep my head on a swivel‚Ä¶.yet, ahhhh, can relax and let it drift!

                Range,Hello Lady, hope you are well!You have the right of it. Folks need to move. There is no rescue, reclamation or redemption for the failing FUSA. I don‚Äôt know about Mormon lands but there seems to be a possible resurgence of smaller to midsized towns in the South and Midwest.If people can relocate their families and find sufficient enough employment then I suggest relocating.Find a religious group in your new area and be the man or woman further to the the right than their most traditionalist member.Get evolved in local elections, school boards and organizations and gatekeep the hell out of it from any fool flirting with the latest globohomo fad.If you are relocating from a Leftist Hive then you have the opportunity to speak to locals about the horrors you have left behind. That has the duel effect of confirming flyover country people‚Äôs suspicions that they are correct in their suspicions that the ‚Äúcity people‚Äù have gone mad‚Ä¶ while also confirming to them that you approve of the locals lifestyle and wish to adopt it (imitation is the sincerest form of flattery).I speak from experience.

                    Hi Penitent! Nice to hear from you. Doing well, as best as can be during civilisational collapse. As I say to Basic Husband, ‚ÄúWell, a bunch of someones were alive during every big collapse, and it might as well be us! Somebody has to do it!‚Äù If I had it to do over again for setting down roots in another location, I might research the Ozarks for more like-minded folks, good land and water. Too close to the eastern big cities for me though. The problem isn‚Äôt just Mormon sheep brain, there‚Äôs a high degree of mass formation hypnotised brain back here. The church said ‚ÄúYou Peck Up!‚Äù and most of them did. However, after the globalist coup in March 2020, and shortly into the coup, a lot of people like me said screw the masks and I wore mine under my chin or on my forehead. One day I wore a Kotex over my mouth. Man, women hate other women when they don‚Äôt fall in line. Additionally, lots of transplants from California and Vegas bring their city lack of resilience and self-sufficiency ignorance.  Also, water is a problem here. Seasonal runoff.  Like Arizona, same problem. Will stay put and ride it out. Sure wish you will, sir. We had good conversations. God bless you man!

            They commit plenty of crimes in their own neighborhoods, to be sure, wreaking havoc on the places they live, but they are no longer being arrested and thrown in jail for committing them. So, they are starting to realize they can go 10, 20, 30 miles away and find nice, quiet, peaceful places full of White people stuff like fancy cars and shops full of goods with glass windows that close that night. So there you go.Whenever I read in my local paper about some insane, out-of-character crime, like a BMW was stolen with a baby inside, or there was some crazy joyride through normally-peaceful streets that ended with the car crashing and flipping over, or some stabbing in a local mall, 99.9 times out of 100 it was committed by some ‚Äúyouth‚Äù from a slum a few towns over. That is when you realize that ‚Äúsundown towns‚Äù existed for a reason.

            It doesn‚Äôt seem to work that way, though. I remember a few years ago, people on twitter started complaining about the the ‚ÄúOscars So White.‚Äù Despite the fact that it was actually more like ‚ÄúOscars So Fellow-White‚Äù, the following year blacks swept the major categories. You would think that some people would have called this out and said, ‚Äúhmm is this actually legit or did ‚Äòwe‚Äô just win a bunch of pity trophies.‚Äù But no, they crowed about it like they just won the battle of Waterloo.They don‚Äôt feel shame. Tom Wolfe called it perfectly when he dubbed it ‚ÄúPlaques for Blacks.‚Äù It‚Äôs extremely effective and serves, as you point out, the dual purpose of humiliating Whites who fully understand what is going on.

Not only are they owed this, but it‚Äôs not enough.  More of course is needed‚Äîand that‚Äôs the problem, Danegeld is never sufficient as they always demand more.

                    This sentiment has been around for many decades. In the 1957 movie A Face in the Crowd, there‚Äôs a scene of a negress on TV endorsing demagogic politician Lonesome Rhodes (Andy Griffith), with a black family watching the endorsement and saying, with surprise, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about time.‚Äù Meaning, it‚Äôs time for negroes to be on television. The whole reparations/entitlement thing has been a long time brewing.

                I had this conversation with libertarian friend who loves riding in the bus with the engine on fire and every time a new molotov is thrown through window, he takes massive pleasure in saying, ‚ÄúI told you this would fail.‚Äù It is such a pathetic loser mindset.This conversation was prompted by him sending me a link to a jobs website that is anti-woke and for us and people with our values. (the subtext of us being conservative and the subtext of that of us being white and tired of the pogrom at work). They had clever videos all narrated by black girls, not even women, but girls. That enraged me.I pointed out the irony that this, ‚Äúalternative‚Äù, is still dispossessing whites in its marketing and promotion. There is no us in their us.I pointed out to him that I don‚Äôt care about the few Thomas Sowell and Jason Rileys anymore. He pointed out that 50% of blacks dislike woke. I asked him which blacks who have been promoted to dispossess us renounce their gains. None.The don‚Äôt care. They don‚Äôt care in the least. They are getting what they want. They don‚Äôt give the first fig about whether or not it was earned. What is important is that the title, the suit, the checks, the status are theirs now.My point to my friend was to stop celebrating losing. I understand the mentality of the blacks who don‚Äôt care about history. They care about revenge and about getting what they want by as Malcom X said himself, any means necessary.I don‚Äôt understand the absolutely devastating mentality of celebrating your own dispossession and the stupidity of being happy at being dispossessed so long as the dispossessor claims to be on your side. It is so far beyond pathetic and it is as big of a problem or more of one than those who happily take our stuff and dance upon our graves. Heck, our own people think calling them the real racists as they do their grave twerk in our face is some consolation. How did we go from Columbus and Vasco de Gama, Magellan, Julius Caesar, Cortez, Lindberg Chuck Yaegar etc ‚Ä¶ to these impotent and pathetic celebrations of losing proving one right?Ah! I am tired of losers and losing.

I defy you to find one blaq wo is willing to admit succeeding in any way (graduating from high school, getting into college, obtaining professional credentials or recognition, etc.) was due in large part to AA.  No, they are convinced they did it ‚Äòdey own self.‚ÄôAs far as lowering standards, see woman in the military.  Same unshakeable belief they ‚Äòachieved‚Äô all on their own.

        Regarding Ukraine we seem to be slouching toward more danger.  The people in positions of power who want to deescalate seem to be getting pushed aside and people who want escalation seem to be advancing.    We have Victoria Nuland about to be promoted to Deputy Secretary of State.     Blinken is forwarding the idea of ‚ÄúIsrael Status‚Äù for Ukraine.
I guess the SOS means escalation to oblivion.    With the cabal no longer worried about elections this is very bad news for us all.

                Blinken will get nowhere as he ‚Äúbargains‚Äù from a weak position with America‚Äôs greatest enemy, China.  Who has strong ties with America‚Äôs second greatest enemy, Russia.  Also note that America ‚Äúattacked‚Äù China first with the unexpected Trump sanctions.

        Is it intentional stupidity or intentional deceit? IOW, do the useful idiots promoting disinformation narratives do this because they are genuinely divorced from reality or do they know its all bullshit but enjoy doing malicious things because that‚Äôs all they got? Methinks the latter.A parasite can only eat (or be on the receiving end of welfare). He cannot produce, and therefore is perpetually afflicted with low self-esteem and consequent self-hatred. She hates hating herself and, since misery loves company, wants to make everyone else as miserable as possible too. This is where narrative mania gets its impetus. If your existence derives solely from being on the welfare dole, you have no hope of ever loving yourself again and you need a narcotic to mask this realization. Enter narrative soma for the masses. Whenever the itch of guilt creeps into your brain, your mind does a knee-jerk response to mantra the current narrative thing.This is why we are devolving as a subspecies here in the USA.

            That‚Äôs the best explanation of ‚Äúself-hatred‚Äù, envy, and ‚Äòbioleninism‚Äô (clumsy term) I‚Äôve ever seen.
I think it explains why trannys and managerials go out of their way to disgust us whilst having to remind themselves of their nobility.
Masking their weakness, lying to themselves and others, inadequates reassuring each other.
Well, sometimes they‚Äôre just f***ed up in the head, but still.

        ‚ÄúIt does, however, point to the limits of narrative control.‚ÄùYes. Complex systems going tits up is the narrative that cannot be controlled.While the day is young, my favorite Juneteenth-related thing so far isn‚Äôt the mass vibrant shooting per se but a story MSN linked about a black holiday ending in ‚Äúy.‚Äù The one photo was of a white guy, and the caption described him as a witness. No shots of perps or victims was published. The implication, of course, is this was a white thing that involved guns and move on.Absurdities like Juneteenth are helping facilitate tuning out and/or laughing at ;TBTB. The managerial class would like to use the day to club whites, of course, but not enough of them (or blacks for that matter) take it seriously enough to care.Finally, let us recall how Juneteenth became a national holiday. In the midst of the state-sponsored Floyd terrorism, Republican senators sought to deal with the crimes by promoting Juneteenth as a holiday. The almost-reliable Sen. Ron Johnson even offered to replace Columbus Day with it.That‚Äôs almost perfect encapsulation of the zeitgeist.

            Also, the Juneteenth mass vibrant shooting has to be seen as of a piece with the water system story in Jackson, Mississippi, and the NAACP‚Äôs call for blacks to boycott Florida. There were lame attempts to spin the Jackson story as ‚Äúracism‚Äù but the realities made that impossible so it was spiked. The Florida boycott naturally led to people asking how their state could receive a similar penalty so it went down the memoryhole as well.As Filthie wrote below, only the Managerial Cult actually believes this nonsense for the most part now, and it probably is getting difficult for them. It is highly likely the people who run their utilities can keep the water flowing for the time being, and there is a reason for that, and they know why.

                Someone in England in high places turned their phone on while Sunak was skewering the stupidity and absurdity of trans-sexuals. Also, videos are being released of the Downing street parties where participants are saying how great it is to be partying but to be sure to not stream the video to anyone.
They know. They feel so low that they love doing anything to lower those who nature placed above them in the natural just so they can feel above them.

They are a pitiable gaggle of deviants. The more they wriggle, and try-hard their selves to be superior, the more they expose selves as the opposite. Granted, with power, but still, for pathetic creatures, mal-formed, dysgenic.
Once you take away the $$$ worship, say looking at the images of this Bezos on his boat with his lovely, down-to-earth lady ‚Ä¶ you are reminded of the Charlie Sheen joke, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt pay hookers for sex, I pay them to leave.‚Äù

        Thanksgiving has turkey, Christmas has ham, July 4th has hotdogs.  We‚Äôre celebrating Juneteenth with a Fried Chicken and Watermelon lunch catered in for the workers at the job site.  Not a single person (they are all white or hispanic guys at a big construction project) is laying off for the day.  Not even for a hang over.

            Ha. I ran this through Word spellcheck and two times it changed it from moot to mute. It made me laugh, so what the hell? It is day of joy and celebration of our increasingly stupid future.
Edit: I corrected it before I start getting e-mails. Still makes me laugh though. Word spellcheck has some weird bugs. It hates the word ‚Äúvery‚Äù for example.

                The Word team is too busy de-colonizing its thesaurus and prioritizing diversity training, diversity hires and other struggle sessions. That is a hell of a lot easier for the HR commandants to understand than fixing a broken Hidden Markov Model as they dole out the priorities for the company.Juneteenth! Let‚Äôs celebrate some other people liberating us with their blood and treasure and use that to bludgeon them as evil bad guys.J.H. Robertson III has a nice article over at Amren talking about the real purpose of Juneteenth. I am sure David Rubenstein and his revolutionary money lurks behind this.Also, Z, here is a high ranking managerial class person with a pretty comprehensive analysis of the white pogroms and their effects. (https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/06/01/complex-systems-wont-survive-the-competence-crisis/)  It focuses purely on business and government, and neglects entirely the catastrophic developments in the judiciary. Still, an excellent read. I sent it without commentary to all of the, ‚Äúcollaborators‚Äù, that I know who I am on terms with.

            Not to worry, this one is in development already.  The only reason it‚Äôs not already a holiday officially on the calendar is this holiday will obviously be for children (like duh!), the younger the better.So the only hold-up is they‚Äôre still developing a character that will have the same level of appeal to the very youngest of children as Santa Claus and Mother Goose do.  Once they‚Äôve cleared this hurdle, crossed this item off their action item list, then it‚Äôs balls to the wall (balls to the scissors?) to get this one as widely celebrated by as many young children as possible.

            If there is some atrocity done to some trans person, yes. TPTB have their ears eternally perked up for a trans rights leader, who could be promoted and then sacrificed to the Pride God by way of a lunatic right winger or fundamentalist Christian, working by himself or being prodded by the FBI.

            The fags on Blab we‚Äôre celebrating Juneteenf by poasting pics of those two dead jews that were executed back in the 50s  for selling atomic bomb secrets to the Soviets. üòÇüëç
I am humbled by the genius required to elegantly combine so many hate crimes into one single poast. 1000 heads must have exploded in the FBI and ADL.
We now live in an age where propaganda only works on the cult. The internet and cell phones have the cult leaders under the microscope 24/7/365‚Ä¶ and only true believers can overlook what they‚Äôll see.

            Excellent points but people, even with black pigment, don‚Äôt need to celebrate these holidays for them to serve their purpose.
MLK day and Juneteenth succeed in enabling the managerial class to virtue signal that they are good people, reinforce the idea that bad whites are not just bad, they are evil, and American history really only involves oppression by white people.
More importantly these bogus holidays support the narrative that a chosen tribe aided by people of color ended the nightmare of traditional American life and are leading us towards paradise, one ‚Äù let‚Äôs hate whitey‚Äù holiday at a time

                Yes. And in school, they will emphasize that Juneteenth, as the official holiday is named, National Independence Day will be emphasized to the children. They will grow up with Juneteenth as our nation‚Äôs great Independence Day ‚Äì which whites provided through our blood and treasure. Plot hole? Hollywood will fix that by depicting valiant all black armies killing off deadweight racist white soldiers soon enough and that will be put in the textbooks.Then MLK will be heavily celebrated and Obama will get his own holiday.My point is, make every effort to teach your children your heritage and to ceremonialize it in some way. Do we have the will and fortitude to preserve our people and heritage as the Jews did/do? We‚Äôve been pushed into being Jews in our own homelands. The clock is ticking and we need to move beyond baseball, Mom and Apple Pie and Old Glory. Time to go deep in our history and heritage and effectively pass it on to our posterity. What a glorious opportunity to better ourselves.

            Right. Should they ever be in need of an idea for a Juneteenth statue, they might consider a black woman twerking on an ambulance.‚ÄúScores of black women twerking on ambulances‚Äù as they attempt to maneuver through crowds to transport black on black shooting victims.
