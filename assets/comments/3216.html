        Hi Z-man‚Äì
A mild historical correction: the name of the Anglican archbishop in question is Thomas Cranmer, not Cranmore. I‚Äôm surprised that none of your Anglican/Episcopalian readers have noted the error.

        Thanks for your reply about the photo.  I don‚Äôt mean to beat a dead horse, but I thought it‚Äôs very interesting that you‚Äôd take an image watermark more seriously than the copyright notice that‚Äôs posted on the page. After all, anyone could watermark the photo with their own name just as easily as they could upload the image under their own name. (I have registered the photo with the U.S. Copyright Office, which is about as definitive as it gets, so if push comes to shove I‚Äôm not worried about proving my case.)Anyway: I‚Äôm sorry that you took the post down.  I like it that people are using this picture all over the political spectrum. I just wanted to get credit for my work. Take care and be well.

            Well, I think the way you are going about it is stupid and irritating, but it‚Äôs your life. I added a credit and reloaded the post. Just know that I contemplated several alternatives that you would have liked a helluva lot less than this one. Not everyone you pester is going to be so restrained.

        Unfortunately, in Western democracies, Christianity in general has become soft and flabby, allowing progressive ideas to slowly infect and weaken it. Combine this with a political system/religion called Islam that is on its latest jihad, with it‚Äôs stated goal to destroy Western civilization, and you have a recipe for disaster. And for some reason, our elitist governments can‚Äôt bring more Moslems in fast enough.The woman who interrupted the Moslem prayer service was not a heckler, as she was characterized in the news, but a very brave person to stand up in their midst and say what she did. I wonder how she was able to get in, as security was very tight and those in attendance were there by invitation only.

        The former Archbishop of Canterbury may well have thought that as Jewish law was allowed within the realm of English law (sorry, Brussels law, naughty me for forgetting) then other similar laws ought to have their place too. If muslims wish to say divorce by the rules of their society ‚Äî and God knows it is not British society ‚Äî then they can. I think even Williams may well be ware (as Christians are routinely butchered in Islamic dumps) that Sharia is appalling but in the spirit of trying to be modern he opened his mouth a little too carelessly.Still, loose words come easy to the modern man and there is apparently no consequence to be faced for such rash ideas.Incidentally Peltast, the ‚Äòpagan‚Äô ideas weren‚Äôt quite wiped out following the Romans. Quite a few people in the British Isles still think the old Celtic and Norse gods and those quaint Druidic practices weren‚Äôt all as bad as advertised. It may not be the state-approved religion today but as no one has proved there is only one God or lots of gods then the jury is still out.

            Tim, I‚Äôm not editing six month old posts. You can stop pestering me about this now. Thanks.Having thought about it, that was unnecessarily terse. Look. I have no idea who you are or if you‚Äôre the source of the photo. I got it fromthis pageand your name is nowhere on it. You may be the guy who took the pic, but I have no way of knowing that.That‚Äôs the problem with loading pic on a site like Flickr without a watermark or your name embedded in the image. They can get copied a million times in an hour. My suggestion is you start adding watermarks to your pics and you don‚Äôt have to nag blogger like me when one of your pics gets used.I took down the post in question as it is six months old. The issue is now closed.
