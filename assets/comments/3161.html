        Having spent a good portion of my life living in MA, I understand fully the feeling that my vote was always for naught, yet still I persevered and voted at every election. I empathize with those who feel it’s all a corrupt “game” that they do not wish to play, but sitting on the sidelines (which is certainly anyone’s right to do so) seems like throwing in the towel. People that purposely do not vote believe that they are withdrawing their consent, but I would argue that if you do not vote you are giving a silent assent to what is happening. Even when I know my vote is meaningless in terms of determining the desired outcome, I vote to register my dissent. I am not willing to throw up my hands and bow out in disgust even though I am disgusted. While I breathe, I live; while I live, I fight. Even with something as small as my single, “meaningless” vote.

        […] They didn’t end well. Still, that old sense of obligation is there. It is not that my vote counts or that I really care who wins. That’s not my fault. Forces beyond my control have made my citizenship worthless. What I can control is how I discharge my duties and obligations. That means I’ll probably stop at my polling place in the morning and cast my ballot. The choices may be awful and I may hate having to vote for any of them, but at least I will have done my duty. My country may not care much for me and citizenship may mean nothing, but I still can be a good citizen. At least I’ll have that. […]

        Damned if you do, damned if you don’t.
I have voted in most elections, well, had my name signed off and voted for the ballsiest name or party on the list. And left with my hands in my pockets.
To lift our spirits, how about a recollection of the chipped beef tradition at your house since Thanksgiving is coming up?

        There’s an argument in favor of dropping out as a protest:http://libertyblitzkrieg.com/2014/11/03/the-dissident-dad-why-i-opt-out-of-voting/
I’m not sure I entirely buy it. Harm reduction has value too. You get one life and if voting makes your time less awful then you should probably vote.

        Voting just makes you a stupid citizen, not a good one.  This system is so corrupt and broken that any person with a conscience can’t support it anymore.  We may have to pay our taxes, but we don’t have to swallow the lie.

        I believe in the States you have voting machines though perhaps not everywhere, but here in the UK for now we have the good old stubby pencil on a bit of string and the space to draw a cross on the ballot paper (oddly, I always felt a cross was a negative mark as the last person you’d want representing you, but apparently a tick for correct is not allowed.)Anyway, the joy of being able to write on the ballot paper means that some people deliberately write nasty, or perhaps accurate comments, about the state of government. I haven’t yet indulged, though a relative of mine has, and we speculated afterwards whether these comments are kept as guidelines, ignored or chuckled over. There may be several hundred of such ‘spoilt papers’ in each district, depending on turn out.In there UK though the Labour government increased the number of postal votes in a move to cynically improve their vote. It was hoped to have the local religious leader (who probably speaks English) to gather up the blank postal forms on behalf of the many who don’t and fill them out with a cross in the Labour candidate box. Eventually, like your Mayans and Aztecs, such move will cancel out the non-Labour vote though more than myself are beginning to recognise that the next stage is for this country to have non-Labour candidates for some religious based doctrine and they will get the votes, naturally.A man called George Galloway, a former Scottish socialist who once famously saluted Saddam, desperately panders to this ideal but even he may find growing a beard isn’t enough to keep his seat in parliament. I expect any spoiled ballots in his constituency may reflect this.
