        Grab a neat Michters and a neckbrace to prevent trauma from shaking your head in disbelief at the complete lack of the faculty of reason in these ‘college’ students’ posts on the ‘change’ site. I’m posting just one of hundreds that truly make me wonder what will become of our nation.:https://www.change.org/petitions/ucsb-students-staff-faculty-community-administration-and-chancellor-yang-support-and-be-in-solidarity-with-ucsb-professor-miller-young“Those pro-lifers were wrong on all accounts. They were wrong for those pictures. They were wrong for chasing a pregnant woman AND they are clearly connected to white supremacists groups who are now attacking Dr. Miller-Young on racial grounds. They cam to this campus specifically to start drama. Free-speech is one thing, even provocative free-speech is tolerable, but their entire purpose was to confont this campus with violent imagery and psychological violence.”(Note how now the pro lifers were “chasing” the 3-month-along-clump-of-cells-carrying teacher? Was she running off with their property? (The signs?) funny how the left is so adept at omitting facts to make their fantasy version of reality bought by their fellow travelers.)

        If IQ is a legacy of slavery, it is in dragging the two digits up fifteen points above African levels.

        In my day, my parents wished fervently that I would get marks sufficient to be admitted to University.
I hope my kids will be plumbers or electricians.  If they do, they can look upon themselves as worthwhile, skilled, self sufficient citizens rather than the useless holders of BAs and MAs.

        Maybe it’s time to whip up a “delusional professors in college humanities” Who’s Who.Cross referenced with “Where they were bestowed “credentials”, as well as the amount of “free” or “discounted” education dollars are spent on their classes.“Mandatory” professors classes ought to get “special” mention.Maybe even a “Where are they NOW”-CV/Resume/arrest/”special” court records, for successful graduates of their “studies” programs.
