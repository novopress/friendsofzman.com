        My ongoing disillusionment with the press and the government has me questioning whether I can really believe what I’m told about Iran’s genocidal intentions toward Israel. I was lied to about the Iraq’s WMDs. I was lied to about the need to invade Afghanistan, and then to stay there for 20 years. I was lied to about RussiaGate, about COVID. It’s almost certain I was lied to about the Kennedy assassination, probably Watergate, and I’d wager the fate of Jeffrey Epstein.Why would I believe what the press and US government have told me about Iran?There are many nations that have nukes. It hasn’t seemed to make any of them inclined to blow up the world. Not even North Korea. As far as I’m concerned, a nuclear-armed Iran would just be a counterbalance to nuclear-armed Israel.

        I’ve been engaging pretty regularly with AI in the past year or two and I have come to the conclusion that it doesn’t much worry me, yet.The things that it is right about are the sorts of things Wikipedia is right about (probably not surprising since I’m sure Wikipedia is part of typical training sets. Like Wikipedia, on controversial topics the big corporate AIs tend strongly toward supporting Currently Approved Opinions.But stray too far off the beaten path and AI is very frequently not just wrong, but wrong in hilarious ways that even a rather unimpressive human would be able to self-correct.We’re a very long way from super-intelligent actual general artificial intelligences. And what’s more, AI seems very derivative, not creative. Sure, you can have it write a story or essay or python script for you, but it is mostly just cribbing from what humans have already done and which has been fed into it.

                That’s the kind of logic that said in 1975 to invest in leisure suits and disco balls, because their trajectory was going nowhere but up.

                    If in 1975 you had iterated rapidly whilst burning mountains of cash would you have ruled the world by 1980 through developing better leisure suits and the most utterly fabulous disco balls?Was there a Winner Takes All Scenario where the USSR invented the Uber-Disco-Ball and Leisure Suit Larryski and his Animatronic Lounge Lizards got to have their evil goose stepping ways with our precious bodily fluids?The incentives this time (to put it mildly) Differ. Or it’s enough that the Big Money and Big Military think so.It’s an open question just how far the AI revolution will go… But one way or the other we’re going to find out Good and Hard. Even if they never hit AGI, it’s going to cause plenty of social disruption.Glass half full says fission power plants are about to boom.Pet Rocks. You read it here first.

                Well, there are two things “AI” can do.
It can check masses of data for signals and patterns that human observers can’t readily find, or it can impose probability on things that don’t really work that way. (This is why chatbots lie.)
The more that it does the latter, the moreerrorit commits, the more that nerds, “tech,” governments and fools will love, obey, and desire to impose it. Ideally—and this ideal may have been secretly achieved—it’snever right.

                Exactly. The key feature at present of AI is snaffling up vast, unlimited amounts of data and processing it. Data such as every email or comment or tweet we ever posted and the political views contained therein…

                Didn’t they shut AI down under Biden? You used to ask it things, and it had years it couldn’t answer questions about. They must be really scared about it gaining intelligence and figuring their stupid schemes out and rejecting telling lies.

            Vizzini is correct.Humanity at large does not understand intelligence, and most people really do not understand intelligence. Same for AI, so you have two black boxes that both process information being compared to each other in the crudest of ways. If one black box is improving, then its “intelligence” has increased. The tech bros doing the lecture tours are terrible at all of the above, and are quite simply not intelligent enough for the topics they pretend to be experts at by proximity. The actual researchers are another species of expert. Most are only capable enough to be dangerous.The improvements in AI are about decreasing error while utilizing larger data sets. Hands now have the correct number of fingers. Videos have fewer enigmas. Speech is less stilted and grating. Nothing more than reduction of error via brute force utilization of more.The trick to focus on is how AIs are said to “lie”, because that illuminates what these machines are doing when they generate a given response to a given prompt. AI do not process information in order to arrive at a conclusion in the way the human mind does. Rather, it does a logical transform on a given prompt in order to generate a data output that looks correct. “Looks correct” is not the same standard or process as “is correct” to a properly trained human mind in search of objective truth. The inescapable problem for AI is that any query outside of its training data or live data has to either fail to provide a response or the machine falls back to generating an output that looks correct, strictly according to existing data, strictly according to the patterns of data within its training data. While not technically ex nihilo, it is practically ex nihilo for strict standards of truth, or very akin to how a human answers a question with an ex nihilo response.Chatbots get around the above problem because generic communication between people is evaluated on “looks correct” standards. Hard analysis of new problems will almost always generate a lie, or at best, a summary of existing, tangential data evaluated on the basis of word patterns or associations within existing data.I say this because the AI doom people are selling for attention and money is bogus, and people should focus on their lives in peace instead. Or other, more important matters at least.That said, AI is going to change the playing field of human life dramatically. Most of that will be from experts – who are just capable enough to be dangerous – being reckless and experimental. At some point, people are going to us AI to crash a significant portion of the global economy because it made them the most money in the shortest amount of time. At some point, someone is going to declare that AI has now invented new technology because they trained it to do an experimental technique and exhausted all possible experiments with the technique. At some point, someone is going to utilize AI correctly on the battlefield and become wildly successful while all the other nations fumble around trying to get AI to control their military because it is “more intelligent” than them. At some point, another nation is going to become South Korea because they used AI to “optimize” their work force in the same way that the oligarchs of South Korea enslaved most of their work force – the race to the bottom of worker exploitation became an automated summary and numerical analyses of existing exploitation techniques for the benefit of the oligarchs.The problem with AI is not AI going rampant in some significant sense. The problem is that AI will be another tool of power in the hands of a corrupt and evil ruling class, who are just clever enough to manipulate a situation to their advantage.“Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.”That quote is going live. Crudely, but prophetically none the less.

        South Africa’s been collapsing for twenty years, but it never happens.
True enough, but neither have they done the equivalent of performing the world’s first human heart transplant or fielding their own atomic (hydrogen?) bomb. Both of those, in their day, were rather towering feats of technology. Those are but two examples I am aware of.On the plus side, it’s my understanding that, for all its troubles, South Africa remains the destination for migrants from other parts of Sub-Saharan Africa. Life must be better there or at least, less bad.

            South Africa resembles Ukraine in that they were made to disarm, especially nuclear weapons and promised certain things because of disarming, and none of those things happened, or even could happen. Doh. (And that is why Hunter Biden is now in South Africa instead of Ukraine.)

        UK privacy: I follow the UK (tabloid) press. Unless I’m mistaken, in the UK even its owncitizensare subject to interrogation if they’ve just arrived from overseas, under one or more so-called terrorism laws. It’s my understanding that said citizen can be detained, be interrogated, have his electronics confiscated or scanned and that he must divulge passwords or other security features upon demand.But, apparently, if you’re an illegal migrant crossing the Channel on a rubber boat, your mobile phone has some special right to privacy granted it. Curious.It’d be fascinating to know what rights – if any – an American citizen has to privacy upon return to the US if he falls under some type of suspicion. I’m aware that for whatever reasons, some of the rights of the citizen do not hold at or near borders. E.g. you and your effects are subject to search after you exit the plane. Not a good choice if you’re bringing in a few Kg. Of cocaine or what-have-you. But would similar logic apply to demanding access to passwords that protect otherwise private electronic data?

        Long ago Laurie Anderson (O Superman, Hiawatha, USA I-IV, etc) was applying for a passport…and had to list an occupation. There really wasn’t any normal term she could use to describe her work. So, she wrote “content provider.” Later she told that story and i think that’s when that term entered the lexicon.

        This would be a great time to arrest Graham for treason or whatever. Zelensky has just given the admin the perfect excuse to start rounding up the neocon gangsters and beat confessions out of them just like their hero’s did 100 years ago. Nothing should be off the table after all we have witnessed. The whole government, all three branches, by their actions and inactions both, proved irrefutably that we are not a nation of laws but a nation of men and wills. There is a contest to be won by whatever means required and this is no time to observe self-imposed restraints and polite fallacies that the enemy ignores with open contempt in their unrelenting efforts to enslave or destroy us.The tranny freak wearing devil horns and prying open the doors to an elementary school to whisper tales of sodomy and abortion into the ears of innocents is both a regular occurrence in our actual lived experience and the perfect allegory in miniature for the moral standing of the enemy. Could their evil be any more explicit? What restraint is proper to observe in the morally mandatory effort to remove them from power?

        Most entertaining as always!  I have found the greatest application of AI for my purposes is in translation. Has Derb utilized this for translation yet? ChatGPT is amazing. Each of the different AIs have different proficiencies with translation and different utilities, ie precision, technical language, figurative, language, etc., but chat is so strong you can take a picture with stylized to say Japanese or Chinese writing in the picture and the AI will select out the writing, translated and explain its relation to the picture!

I’m reading some untranslated Japanese books now.

        If “prouds” gains widespread usage as a way to refer to the sexually diverse, I’m certain it will, sooner than later, become a term of derision, just as “woke” has.

        The Court of International Trade opinion gets into the weeds in some places, but it is reasonably intelligible to non-lawyers, and makes a lot of sense.https://www.cit.uscourts.gov/sites/cit/files/25-66.pdf.
The framers of the Constitution did not intend for the U.S. to be a democracy. They feared democracy, and said so. Separation of powers was only one of the firewalls they tried to create against democracy. They believed that the Supreme Court had the final word on the constitutionality of acts of Congress and the President. Some of them did not believe that this power extended to acts of the states.

Says who?
John Marshall invented that doctrine out of thin air.

        I’m a regular browser of Coffee &amp; COVID. The blog host, Jeff, lately has been posting some stimulating bits about AI. Disclaimer: Jeff is an attorney and, methinks, a bit too credulous about the evil potential of AI. Witch makes his statements all the more curious, which I will critique below:https://www.coffeeandcovid.com/p/chip-of-the-west-saturday-may-31Let us grant as true that Anduril is a successful niche DoD contractor. The firm and its young chief have done exceptionally well, if Jeff’s account rings true. Very well, let’s look at this supposed super weapon, the Fury.While I didn’t look in depth, I’m assuming that the information that appears in Slashgear is basically a press release. The Fury is a pre-production prototype. But again, for the sake of argument, let’s assume that it’s capable of what Jeff claims for it. I know little of DoD procurement except that the end price is usually many multiples of the original promised cost, but again, let’s concede that $30 million per is realistic. Based on the photo, I’d think that not unreasonable.Essentially what you have is a mini fighter jet. It probably could field some small weapons. But armament and range wise, it’d seem unlikely to compete even with half-century old human-flown fighters.What Fury does have going for it is that it’s cheap. Call it 1/10 the cost of a “normal” fighter jet.A major unknown here is just how effective the Lattice OS (AI) is in flying the plane. Perhaps spectacular, who knows? And that’d be a big plus. Probably the Fury can be FPV (human remote) flown, but if jammed, or simply for autonomous operation, the AI takes over. Lots of possibilities there. I’m not denying this is new tech.But for every new measure there is, or at least will attempt to be, a countermeasure. Not the least of those are those cheap drones. I don’t know the exact pricing, but for $30 million, hell even just $3 million, any day of the week give me some existing drone technology with the usual weapons they can carry, and the support staff to field them, and I will do a lot more damage than a single Fury will be able to. All else equal, some equivalent of Lattice OS or even a simplified version is perfectly capable of flying a low-tech drone bearing munitions to a pre-selected target. Or if jammed, it can choose targets at will. Drones are being flown “by wire” (actually fiber optic) in Ukraine right now; while they have limited range, they are impervious to any electronic jamming, making them extremely difficult to defend against. Even if my el cheapo drone cost $30K each, which probably buys a shitload of tech these days, that means I can field 1,000 drones for each Fury, which at the minimum requires a fairly long runway or an aircraft carrier. In contrast, my drones are being deployed from small squads in the woods or perhaps if a larger model, at a desert airstrip a hundred miles away.As the saying has it, quantity has a quality all its own.As to Jeff’s musings on consumer AI: I have some background in computing. I think Jeff is making a false compare in this sense. Let’s take it as true that the Fury’s AI software makes it a peer or near-peer for most tasks a human flown fighter jet could do. That’s impressive to be sure, but it’s a highly specialized niche. Now contrast that with “General” AI (AGI): it’s far more difficult to be good, or even mediocre, at a large number of unrelated tasks. Humans, and probably many animals, are still many orders of magnitude better at tasks requiring general, adaptive problem-solving or learning.Jeff’s (and some of guys here) opining that they’re hiding the truly powerful AI. Well, of course that could be true. But on the other hand, the nature of market competition says otherwise. If a firm actually had a product that offered an improvement, they would certainly make sure the potential market knew about it. Yes, great leaps of technology happen, but not often, and any advantage is usually temporary. I don’t doubt for a minute that “consumer” AI has built in censors, guard rails etc. But there’s no reason an AI would have to have those, and there probably are ones that don’t.I suspect the AIs that are kept under wraps are hidden not because they have amazing technology that no one else has, but that they are trained on “forbidden” data sets that the Proles are not supposed to see.AI is not some God-like new power. It may well continue to evolve. It does some things very capably. Even 30+ years ago computers were beating Grandmasters at chess, for instance. AI language translation seems to work very well. I’ve used it on occasion. But approximating true intelligence? I think there’s still a long road to be traveled. Can an AI do even elementary logic? Perhaps some. But how about dealing with ambiguous or conflicting information? It’s in the more complex types of “reasoning” that AI will have the greatest difficulties. It is probably true that, in terms of raw “computing power”, the average young child, or perhaps, even smart dog, ahs more smarts than the latest AI that bills itself as general purpose.Until there is a true quantum advance, folks, all that gittering technogly is just a glorified adding machine. Yes, it’ll run rings around a human with only paper and pencil, or even an abacus, if the task is adding up numbers. But it’ll be stumped by many mundane tasks that we humans do as a matter of course in our everyday lives.If we become enslaved or otherwise controlled by AI, it’ll probably not because the AI has become sentient, but because human elites are wielding it as a weapon against the masses.

            Air to air combat itself is looking somewhat obsolescent these days, since the SAMs have gotten so good. So that even $30 million per might be wildly overpriced. Not that that would stop the DoD from buying some.
