        Couldn‚Äôt say. I turned off the TV years ago. Culture where you make it. In my world, blacks are slaves, servants or criminals. Jews are untrustworthy and there are only two genders.The world can go straight to hell, I am not going with it.

            Any concern for you grandchildren?   I‚Äôm guessing that isn‚Äôt a consideration.    Here‚Äôs hoping you see hell first.   Shame on Z‚Äôs readers for their upvotes on this comment.

        Field report here from a relatively new reader and commenter. I‚Äôm in my early 30s and attend a trade school. By stroke of luck or of some dissident in the HR department, my entire class is working-class white guys my age or younger and we‚Äôre all 100% aware of what‚Äôs going on out there. This is in the northeast, too, lest you think that geography might affect our political views.I listened to Z lament the end of freedom of association with Cotto and Gottfried a few days ago on the RBG podcast. We don‚Äôt have that problem. The ability to crack racial jokes, talk about our wives/girlfriends and just generally hang out with the fellas without being listened to or harangued has really been fun.

            Be careful. There‚Äôs always an informer in a crowd. It‚Äôd be a shame for one of them to come back one day and tell everyone how you made insensitive racial jokes. We live in an authoritarian regime. My advice: act that way at all times.

            Thanks.  Field reports are very valuable and appreciated.  I don‚Äôt think most appreciate how easy it is to get out of touch with the way people of different ages and classes are thinking.  I ‚Äòm a prof at a professional school.  I used to be able to talk to students but they are increasingly clamming up and keeping traps shut. I‚Äôm afraid that frank uninhibited conversations are a casualty  of the current age.

        For a long while now I had scorn heaped upon me among former friend groups for noticing the earliest stages of blackwashing. As you mention, the loan black in some period drama is amusing and could ‚Äì even in the case of England ‚Äì have been at a stretch plausible. But when significant figures from history, as well as popular fictional characters turn black, you know something‚Äôs up.Imagine Ben Franklin played by Morgan Freeman.This would not surprise me. I am eagerly awaiting the first WW2 film that will feature a prominent political or military figure that has had the ‚Äòblack‚Äô treatment. It is indeed cultural destruction and this is why the first step for people who realize something dodgy is going on, is to verse themselves in the history of their people.I noticed an article onThe Guardianthe other day lamenting the success of the Boer settlement, Orania. If it can be said that something is going right in SA for community minded whites who are aware of the dangers, then I have hope of a greater number of ‚Äòawakenings‚Äô.

            I remember there was some discussion of blackwashing James Bond.  I‚Äôm Canadian, white and still fairly young; so I‚Äôve been told my whole life by predominately female teachers that I will we replaced by a more tolerable hue before long.  But even normie begins to notice when they start gunning for the few roles young white men can relate or aspire to.These days, if there‚Äôs a ridiculous female character (the kind played by Scar Jo or Charlize Theron), an outrageously cast vibrant, or any excessive anti-white/anti-male overtones, I reflexively turn it off.The atmosphere of everything antiMEhas become exhausting.  Pretending like I enjoy it, or that it is somehow for the greater good?  Not possible.I like to think there are enough of usbadthinkersout there, creative and talented, to fill the void of creative and cultural content sacrificed on the alter of diversity.

                Sure, they may blackwash Bond but none of this is really important to me anymore. I know the history of the character and enjoyed the films, but that was then. Now, I‚Äôll happily discard this poison. What it has become does not destroy what it once was.
I reflexively turn it off.
Absolutely. Take a walk, read a book. Think about what comes next. If we accept that government will not be reformed then it is a safe bet that all mainstream movies are off the cards.

                    Blackwashing Bond, if and when it happens, is simply a case of cultural imperialism. James Bond is the ultimate white man, for all sorts of reasons. And that is why, in the eyes of the AWRs, he must be destroyed and replaced by a Hutu. It is a symbolic dethroning of the white man. Maybe the last white man.

                Toronto, checking in.
We have to be the role models ourselves. Be in good shape, and muscular. Be confident, not apologetic. If somebody has a question don‚Äôt be afraid to answer it. I personally get alot of stares just because I don‚Äôt scurry along like a good little cuck. If you‚Äôre a member in a youth sports league, or a church, or whatever, don‚Äôt be afraid to step in and mentor. Our boys need it.
Canadian whites (75% goodwhites) are the worst, they would rather see their daughter raped by blacks than be called ‚Äúracist‚Äù.

                        Blackwashing has been totally normalized in Canada for sometime now.¬†Diversity laws discourage casting white men in any Canadian made content (see comedian Ryan Longs take on this). The people writing the ‚Äòdiversity laws‚Äô are the same people importing the vibrants.¬†As B123 points out, 80% of whites see this as totally normal, especially the youth.Noticing this doesn‚Äôt make you a cuck, just clear headed.

                    I actually knew a girl who grew up in a liberal family in which racism was the greatest of crimes. She had a black bf in college.She was subsequently robbed and raped by blacks.The black BF may have been behind it, after telling his homies what a sucka dat white bitch was.It was a shame, she was a real cutie. She learned how to deal with it stoically and didn‚Äôt come unglued over it, but even after that she never got redpilled on race.

                Who knows. Perhaps there was a jogger or two in the time of Alfred of Wessex‚Ä¶ maybe even in William‚Äôs time. Certainly, Queen Elizabeth I is said to have remarked disapprovingly about the dusky sailors down by the dockside. In those days, all colours could probably have been pressed into naval service as the fledgling Navy struck across the seas.The key point, as always, is that England is a white entity. It‚Äôs founding people were white. It‚Äôs great persons were all white. For most of it‚Äôs thousand year history, it has been almost entirely white. I have no issue with people making legitimate claims that certain races may have been present, but as with your remark about the ‚Äòjournalist‚Äô, you get the feeling these people desperately want to be included. First it‚Äôll be one jogger, then before you know it King John was black and so were his advisors ‚Äì with no evidence given.

                BBC History Extra Podcast. Used to enjoy it. A few months ago they had a piece on some aspect of Anglo-Saxon history. The chief editor, a twat named Rob Attar, interrupted the guest historian in mid broadcast, to remind him that ‚Äúthere is a growing movement to stop calling these people Anglo-Saxons because some modern groups use the term with pride and hate.‚ÄùThe Anglo-Saxon historian immediately cucked and agreed. He spent the rest of his segment stumbling over himself saying things like ‚Äúthe uh, um medieval people from that area, uh um, that were in that particular, um linguistic and cultural uh.. group.. ‚Äù and ‚Äúthese uh, um people that we are talking about, um, formerly known as the um‚Ä¶ Anglo-Saxons.. um, for lack of a better term ‚Äù ‚ÄúUm, they would often refer to themselves as um.. the Saxons, but well, errr‚Ä¶ ‚ÄùDamn the whole erasing particular figures from history. They are now seeking to erase the names of whole groups of Our People. Pure evil. Maybe hate shouldn‚Äôt be eschewed. Maybe it is better donned like righteous armor.

Maybe there has been some pushback on BBC History Podcast. Couldn‚Äôt say, the bile it engendered in me that night has kept me from revisiting the site. Plenty of other sources.

                            Yes. The BBC is a thoroughly compromised source. That is not to say it is all lies, but there are certain things they‚Äôll skirt around or fabricate.
Your example is a very good indication of how shame around a term can catch on. If this is left unchecked, Anglo-Saxon is something that will go by the wayside in years to come.
On the plus side, words can still be used privately, and censorship always leads to new words being created to describe the same things. My favourite of the past year has been ‚Äòjogger‚Äô.

            I recently watched the movie Knives Out. It was one those murder mysteries set in a mansion on a sprawling estate where the wealthy family patriarch is murdered and an internationally famous private detective (played by Daniel Craig) shows up to solve the crime. Initially, I thought it was cliched but watchable. As the movie goes on you find out that the old man‚Äôs young private nurse is an anchor baby of illegal immigrants from Central America. Also, this nurse is not just a good person, she is an unbelievably saintly good person. In the course of time, the mystery is solved and all the family gathers for the reading of the will and it is revealed that the old man left his entire fortune to his anchor baby nurse because she was the only one that was kind to him. The old man‚Äôs daughter exclaims something like ‚Äúbut this is our ancient family home‚Äù to which someone replies, paraphrasing, ‚Äúcome on Doris, you know Dad bought the house in 1997‚Äù. The movie portrayed illegals as industrious, kind, and deserving and the White family as rotten, evil, and having no more claim on America than any Third World immigrant that showed up yesterday. Bonus ‚Äì the young nephew was a pro MAGA character which allowed a whole scene with family members taking shots at Trump.

                Likewise, the new Netflix productionYoung Wallander, one of the now-faddish ‚Äúprequels‚Äù to popular earlier movies and TV. Two previousWallanderseries, one starring Krister Henriksson and the other Kenneth Branagh, were actually about crime fighting (as well as personal issues). The Netflix prequel revolves around race and migrants.To look at it you would think it‚Äôs set in New York. Premature Wallander does his work amid black gangs, one prominent member with a new-fashioned flowerpot hairdo. His girlfriend, whom he wins over to his side by telling her he‚Äôs protecting migrants, works at a ‚Äúrefugee‚Äù rescue agency occupying a ruined church ‚Äî presumably ruined by migrants.The story line, of course, casts minorities as oppressed good people fighting for their lives in a wicked white country. We see ‚Äúanti-immigrant‚Äù marches with the white participants kitted out like Nazis.Oddly, despite Netflix‚Äôs backing, the series has a low-budget look; some exteriors and establishing shots seem to be used repeatedly. Why waste money on quality production values when the only aim is political propaganda?

            I‚Äôve done my best to impose a ‚Äúblackout‚Äù on my household. Anything relating to vibrancy is avoided or removed with exception of self-defense. If an acquaintance socializes with a vibrant, I remove that person from my life. Music is the sole aspect where I have difficulty. You should try it, the practice can help your mental framework unless you‚Äôre a hopeless sportsball addict, in which case there is hockey.

                    It‚Äôs really not that bad.  I gave up the NBA in high school (mid 80s) and football by the end of the 90s.  Although still a fan of baseball and hockey, I haven‚Äôt watching a second of either sport this summer, due to their servility towards joggers.  I‚Äôve also spent 25 years passionately following Liverpool FC in England and when I saw the kneeling rituals before each game this summer, I tuned out, despite the club winning its first top flight title in 30 years.And you know what, it just gets easier and easier every day.  Even 6 months ago I‚Äôd have never imagined my interest could die out so quickly.

                            Growing up, I played everything at some level. As an adult, I followed most sports to some degree. I‚Äôve been slowly losing interest and now I don‚Äôt follow any of it. The weird thing is, once you stop, going back to watch is impossible. The silliness of it is glaring. Hockey is probably the one exception as the broadcasts are not ridiculous. Listening to baseball is still normal, but I have not listened to a game this year.

                                I watch a fair amount of rugby now, none of the nonsense.  I‚Äôll always love hockey, but the broadcasts have in fact gotten ridiculous.  At least up here in the north, our silly ‚Äúsports journos‚Äù gush all over this woke nonsense.  Perhaps worse than anywhere else in the world.

                                I found something similar years ago when I stopped watching the NFL. Granted, I was never a big fan, would watch a game or two over the seasons while checking out part of a few games.Anyway, I had kids and got a bit busy so drifted away without thinking about it much. Then, years later, I saw a game on, had some time to kill so I sat down to watch.I lasted about 15 minutes. It was all ridiculous and juvenile. Grown men dressed like 12-year-olds cheering on black guys they‚Äôd be terrified to see at night on the street. Women screaming ‚ÄúC‚Äômon boys‚Äù as though they knew these people or that these hired thugs represented their city.It was just really strange to me ‚Äì and it still is.I grabbed my clubs and went to play golf on a near empty course. It was great.

                        I too was Joe Sports Fan until I outgrew peer pressure thirty-plus years ago. But baseball still holds a place in my summer memories. Last night I was in a taqueria ‚Äì nobody wearing a mask, me the only Anglo-Saxon ‚Äì and while I was waiting for my food I watched a baseball game. It was tied, playoff game, you used to know he situation and the feeling. The Dodgers rallied to get a couple on with one out.Then my food was ready and I left. It really is that easy.

        Unplug from the matrix. Cancel your TV. Cancel your Netflix. don‚Äôt go to movies. If you *have* to see something there are so many pirated options out there for free.Whenever i end up watching TV commercials at someone else‚Äôs house, the aggression and volume of the anti-white sentiment is massive. All blacks or mystery meats. Single and strong white woman. Mixed race couple (always a white woman). They never show white families. They have even taken out the dorky white man role, even this was too much representation.I guess normies just don‚Äôt notice? Some normies do notice but they don‚Äôt care. In their case the brainwashing works too. Turn this shit off, you‚Äôll develop a stronger sense of reality.

                Well as a Catholic who hasn‚Äôt attended since the masking, I hope the renewal of baptismal and confirmation vows hasn‚Äôt changed to that.
I do love the empty promises part though. What better definition of what pro government and commies give us. I renounce them.

                    A good litmus test of a Parish right now is how many parishioners eschew the masking nonsense.  Go to a rural parish or a trad parish downtown and  most don‚Äôt care.

                                We‚Äôve got to start laughing at and mocking them.  It‚Äôs been long enough for them to catch on that this is a farce.  No more excuses.
Ace just linked to this video of Governor Wolf and a PA state rep laughing about how they‚Äôll take their masks off on camera at a presser so that they can engage in some ‚Äúpolitical theater‚Äù.

                                        I successfully wore lace panties/thong, BVDs purchased especially to taunt, and a net mask albeit holes not quiet basketball net large.And I was just banned for life from my favorite restaurant by the owner‚Äôs son for wearing the net mask, even though everybody had their masks off while drinking and dining, while I waited for my table.We routinely spent $1k/mo. there with groups and tips and we grew close and personal with the elderly wait staff who had worked there for life. The daughter saw me on the street, told me to wait, and ran out with a free dessert and apologies while crying.So now we‚Äôll eat at the competitor down the street. It‚Äôs pretty good.

                    As a Catholic I‚Äôve tried to eschew hate. As a Christian I‚Äôve tried to wish the other tribes well, while still keeping the fundamental belief that there is really no living together in any realistic or productive way. I‚Äôve not attended any pseudo masses since the pandemic scare because they smack of heresy and cowardice to me.If the Church won‚Äôt defend itself and its God-given right (no, requirement) to gather, while gyms and gay bars open their doors, then they are damned and good riddance. Bolt their doors, God no longer resides there amongst the fay and frightened clerics.I dont have television so I miss a lot. YouTube though,  while watching videos on log cabin production or how-to videos on bee keeping, has been kind enough to include a new spate of commercials which indicate that my country is now apparently 85% black and most of the white men like me are idiots to be rescued by strong, smart and brave women‚Ä¶ particularly women of color.The few historical(ish) movies or series I catch, as per Zman‚Äôs observation, also inform me that most of the major historical events in the story of my people were rife with Africans and warrior women. I never knew. Or that we were such an awful race.Sarcasm aside. I‚Äôve never been much of a hater. But with every fallen statue, every rewritten lie, every demand I see to be obsequious before my darker-skinned betters and screeds of ovary-entitled harpies‚Ä¶ I am learning. To hate, that is.

                            SidVic,
Both of us. Where else to go?The Eastern Orthodox? Tempting. Their denial of Papal Supremacy isn‚Äôt a problem. Most thinking Catholics know Bergoglio serves the Prince of this world. Their refusal of the filioque is a bit more problematic spiritually. Protestantism? Just cause and righteous anger at abuse and coruption‚Ä¶ taken too far in the theological sense, imho. As long as SSPX holds the line, I will too and pray for a new inquisition.

Because of the new view of the definition of the church at Vatican II (the church of christ is NOT solely identified with the Catholic Church), I‚Äôve concluded that what passes for the Catholic Church is counterfeit.I don‚Äôt believe the new ‚Äúmass‚Äù is Catholic, so I read the old mass at home on sundays, and try to live a Catholic life.
I can‚Äôt imagine going to that new service cooked up in the 1970s. ‚ÄúWork of human hands‚Äù indeed it is!

                Funny you put it quite that way. One of my neighbors kids attend a local Catholic School, only it‚Äôs a parish school and not part of the Archdiocese and as such the administration has a bit of a free hand in what makes up the curriculum.Having said that, my neighbor was telling me that at a recent meeting of their PTA one of the parents brought up what Francis The Red spoke about regarding adding the environment to the canonical of what makes a sin. The Monsignor was a bit squishy about speaking ill of what Francis said, beginning with, ‚ÄúWell our Holy Father says.‚Äù and that prompted my neighbor to say, ‚ÄúExcuse me, he isn‚Äôt our Holy Father, he‚Äôs your boss, that‚Äôs a big difference.‚Äù The Monsignor got a bit agitated and mentioned something about showing respect for the faith, to which my neighbor told him, ‚ÄúWhen we get another Urban II on the Throne of Saint Peter, then I‚Äôll show more respect. The enemies of the church are on the march and this guy wants to placate them, not defend the faith. He refuses to do anything about the enemies within as well.‚ÄùHe told me that a number of the other parents nodded their approval and some said things like, ‚ÄúNow you‚Äôre talking.‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs about time!‚Äù I know this is a bit off topic, but what you wrote above brought it to mind. It showed me that not all is lost among the flock. Sticking with topic, my kids have begun complaining about this blackwashing as well. The other day my oldest daughter was watching TV and suddenly said out loud, ‚ÄúWhy is Jake from State Farm black all of a sudden?‚Äù She‚Äôs only nine, so I tried to put it in terms she would understand. She gets it though. One point I do disagree with you on is your assertion that‚Äúwhites would rather be dead, than rude.‚Äùas most whites I know are more worried about losing their jobs, or having their kids kicked out of school that offending blacks.Most of those people I just mentioned know some one who has fallen afoul of the negro worshipers and have suffered for it. Most of these people have been red-pilled on this issue.

                        Thank you. I too would have liked to have been there. I keep reading from different places on line that there is a conservative faction within The Vatican that is laying the groundwork to have Bergoglio deposed. If such a claim is true, I wonder what these people are waiting for?As for Urban II, a man of his time and from what I‚Äôve read about him, he agreed to The First Crusade reluctantly. Or it at least appears that way.

                Neither.The leader of that group is Afro-Cuban and 20% of the membership is POC.Its not a White Supremacist group but more like Civ Nat Brown Shirts sort of thing.Ultimately our elite will resort to near anything to keep the system running  even trying to weaken the people who make the system possible.The reason is simple, when not if it comes down, all of modernity and prosperity  comes with it.Considering what our reaction to Covid 19 did , nearly collapsing the economy and its not over yet I can‚Äôt imagine when serious  violence  become a thing.Society as we know it  will not get up again either. To the knife, knife to the hilt means it will probably be a new dark age or the very least a serious collapse and while its inevitable, people accustomed to power, comfort and such won‚Äôt know how to live without it.

        We‚Äôre going to see a lot of evolutionary pressure amongst Europeans in the next couple of generations. The Scandinavian groups that are historically high-trust to authority and foreigners are going to go all in with hate-whitey, to the point of their own extinction.Other whites of ethnicities with historically better abilities in fog of war environments and better ethnic cohesion will learn to survive through methods of duplicity and fogging their enemies. Their survival boils down to whether the propaganda networks can sufficiently override their innate tendencies.The historic frontiersmen will learn how to create de-facto white communities, just because no minority will want to live in the harsh environment they call home.

            This is not to blackpill ‚Äì but looking around me, I‚Äôm convinced that at least 80% of white people just don‚Äôt have the tools for survival in our new multikult society.
It requires a combination of traits: tribal, low openness, most likely at least moderate physical ability and propensity for violence, low altruism, low respect for authority (willing to break rules).
Right now neither liberals or conservatives have this combination in large numbers. If you‚Äôre here, the solution is to have as many kids as possible. If you‚Äôre too old for that, consider donating sperm.

                        Compsci,I‚Äôve got one, though I wouldn‚Äôt call it adopted. More like, mutually nurturing. I lucked into (Deus vult) finding a family of seven (5th and final child arrived a few months ago) for my rental out of state. Mom and Dad in their 30s. Dad is blue collar worker and mom home schools. Very religious and active in their church (not co-religionists with me but within God‚Äôs familial spectrum). They are on a tight budget and scraping to get their own land and house.This summer I was speaking with the father and he was profoundly expressive in his gratitude that we lowered the rent so they could get in and still have some money to save for their future. He told me the six (number 7 was just a bump at the time) had been living in a 500 sq. ft. converted garage. I know folks have pride so I extended my equal thanks at having good renters and someone who ‚Äúcan do small repairs so I dont have to bring in a handyman constantly.‚Äù We both know it‚Äôs a financial loss but pproprieties must be maintained.I did the math when the family first came to my attention. They were forthright about what they could afford on the top end and thought we would refuse. Impeccable recommendations from respected members of the community. The math said if I picked up 6 overtime and/or holiday shifts per year I could nearly make the money back that I would lose by not renting to strangers at market rate.What is there to think about? The math works and more importantly God‚Äôs abacus reads even. I work those six extra days annually to cover the loss. That‚Äôs the thing. It isn‚Äôt a loss. I‚Äôve been at the same profession for over 20 years and it can be a drag.  But those extra days‚Ä¶ I absolutely love working them. I get to help a young white traditional Christian family stay in a good home and actually get ahead?! Are you kidding? How absolutely blessed am I?So, call it adoption but I get more out of the deal than they do. Purpose, lightness of load, and something for Our People. God‚Äôs kindness to me makes me want to weep at times. Truly.You are correct Compsci. Community is Our only way to victory.

                        We tried to keep one grandfather, but he wouldn‚Äôt kick his addiction. Most of us on This Side with young families have next to no supergenerational role models or family friend figures.  Big whole on our community?

                            Redneck,Then tag Brother, you‚Äôre it. If there aren‚Äôt any ‚Äúsupergenerational models or family friends‚Äù available or worthy then you will have to be that font of wisdom and strength for you and yours. It‚Äôll be harder but more is the glory for you when you succeed with so few/none to help. I pray some will come along to help lighten the load, but if not you will still succeed. And you and all the young families will be the pioneer generation to begin that building process and hopefully y‚Äôall will build that supergenerational tradition that will be ongoing. You will deserve an honored place as a valued elder when you are in your final years.

                    It‚Äôs funny i‚Äôve gotten the chance to talk with alot of young guys lately (my kid‚Äôs friends and i work at a university).  I have long made it a point to tell them to have kids early and often. It‚Äôs one of the few deep pleasures afforded a man. they are often shocked but I can tell they like it. Its never an optimal time to start having kids but if you wait for the perfect circumstances‚Ä¶  ..  It‚Äôs clear they never hear this advice. I‚Äôve made my share of parenting mistakes but i am proud (perhaps inordinately) that i got my kids mostly grown and no tattoos. Except for nicotine, no addictions.  Strangely for a slub like me they are all athletic health nuts. My smartest move was to push my nerdy son into a serious wrestling program in high school which he continued into college.   Expanded his stable of friends and i am increasing   convinced that a combat  sport is extremely valuable for young men. Getting my girls through puberty probably took 15 years off my life. My experience has been that parenting in this environment requires equal parts raging maniac, intelligence agent, and manipulative Svengali.  I was a sneaky wild kid so my kids were disadvantaged with a dad that knew all the tricks. My na√Øve deeply-decent wife would have been rolled without me.  Guess we complement each others attributes.  The societal rot is widespread.  Even at my youngest daughters very good  school,     interracial dating is fashionable as is gender non binary and trans stuff.  Maybe i will write a guerrilla parenting book.  To navigate this clown show requires crafty unconventional methods. I‚Äôve seen too many of the kids of the extremely decent church crowd  go sideways.

                        Sid, how true.  As I reflect in later life, most of us are just so-so.  We are not destined for great accomplishments or undertakings‚Äîthree generations and forgotten at most.
But most of us can form family units, have children and raise them properly (with great effort).  Perhaps that is our one lasting accomplishment.

                            Compsci,We are bigger than that. More than just our blood family. We have to start looking at Our People as family. Sure, a lot are lost and some are traitors, but we save who we can and build from there. I dont care if nobody remembers me in three generations. I‚Äôll be in God‚Äôs embrace hopefully. But if I can look from the other side of the thin veil and see that my People are surviving and thriving, I‚Äôll be a content ghost. And if any of my actions in the here and now, no matter how small, help that along, I‚Äôll be a happy one.

                        Sidvic,Thank you for your story. And you are right, not just in riding herd over your brood, but in extending that advice to your kid‚Äôs friends. We are a people and we have to start building each other up‚Ä¶ particularly Our children in light of the hostility this wicked world is heaping on them.I‚Äôve given my kids good advice though I didn‚Äôt always show them by example.Yes sir. Combat sports are great for them. After years of women schooling them physicality and force is like manna to them.Here is one thing I have found invaluable. I have a few trusted old friends, brothers more than friends really, and I asked them this past year to help mentor my youngest son. One takes him shooting and tree harvesting in the summer, the other is a weight lifter and teaches him combatives. He loves it and I‚Äôve watched my boy respond well to the additional support. It‚Äôs hard realizing that you can‚Äôt be the everything guru to your teen son but Lord it‚Äôs paid dividends.  He‚Äôs also learned to healthy ‚Äúshit talk‚Äù with other men because you can only go so far with dad on that before he jerks a knot in your tail.Nobody is coming to set the ship right. It has to be us. We build the community or we lose everything.

                B123, I thought about the donation thing; i am sure many here would meet high drmand criteria, we could spread our genes, do some bioleninist subversion.

Exactly. You dont get a say or an influence. When the boy that should have been raised by you is parceled out to a lesbian couple that hates men, or the girl you should have treasured is injected into a single about-to-hit-the-wall feminist hussy that will turn her into a stripper with absent daddy issues‚Ä¶ what do Our People profit and what becomes of your poor children?
Intersting off the cuff idea‚Ä¶ but simply immoral upon further examination.

            Long term affluence, and the concomitant lethargy and soft living, inevitably leads to DNA pollution because there is nothing to cull the herd. At some critical juncture, this can only be cured by colony collapse or an artificial return to hardship and a survival-of-the-fittest regime. Yes, the strongest and smartest among us will likely retreat (self-select) to havens of rebirth. And the best among these will be those that survive the interregnum of marauding raiders.

Since there is little to no chance that humans will do it, Nature will force it upon us with (probably) the Biblical war, famine, pestilence.*In this context, to purify the gene pool means that the most successful will survive. I wouldn‚Äôt make any bets on what race(s) will be best adapted, since we can‚Äôt know what the future crisis situation(s) will be. Alas, Eugenics is even less likely than mankind voluntarily limiting his numbers.

        In Bemidji, a Norwegian would be the good guy with a hapless Swede as his sidekick, and the bad guy would be a Finn or an Estonian. Hey, it‚Äôs diverse, just Scandi diverse.
You know for all their so called enlightenment, people who do the sort of thing like blackwashing indulge themselves in what used to be considered an egregious fashion. Like thinking all white people are the same. That‚Äôs the thing about ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù they are some of the most backwards people I have ever come across.

                By the way I was at Barney‚Äôs Beanery 2 weeks ago for 2 nights.  Then at The State Social House on Sunset &amp; Holloway on Sept 15th.  You ever go there?  Someone got run over by a car 50 yards away as I was having dinner on their porch.  Cops, ambulance, commotion.  Prior to that, as I was eating I thought, man cars really fly around this curve.  Then she got hit minutes later.  Tower Records across the street.  Made me happy to see it.  I used to drive out to Hollywood decades ago to search their underground record bins.  Then when I took a closer look during dinner, I could see that the store was empty inside.  Like, abandoned.  Ready to be sold.   It was once the most famous record store in the world.

But they changed the layout a few weeks go.  It used to be more of an indoor-outdoor setup where you could smoke inside.  I was pretty wasted when I was there a few weeks ago but I remember the indoor thing wasn‚Äôt around and we sat on the patio out front

When they first reopened during Covid, you could sit inside and smoke.  All the windows were opened and I guess it passed for being ‚Äúoutside‚Äù.  My guess is they had to stop doing that because of orders from Pope Fauci dictating to Archbishop Newsome
Yeah, now I remember the people sitting in back.  We parked there but walked up and sat in front on the patio.  What you make of the Bullwinkle  statue lol?   Should we tear it down?

I say we tear that shit down.Where moving to?  Not sure.  My daughter is moving to Florida, where I‚Äôm originally from, so wife and I want to see how we deal with being empty nesters finally. Depending on how that goes, we could move to Florida ourselves but I want to move to Blue Ridge Mountains and/or Italy.   My brother lives in Italy, and I may go there for a few years then come back.  Just got a hankering to do something fun and interesting.  So we shall see.Meanwhile, Bullwinkle must DIE

        Who are the whites that reject this?  Who are the ones most likely to reject what‚Äôs going on?  They‚Äôre the ones the system left behind.  They‚Äôre not the ones with the stuffed 401ks and medical insurance that actually still pays for health care.  They‚Äôre whites trapped in the machine that has turned on them.  This is why not ‚Äúbuying product‚Äù is so important.  This includes entertainment product.  All the good movies have been made already anyway.  It‚Äôs not just the ones the system left behind though.  It‚Äôs the ones who rejected it outright.  Who make their money outside of corporate/university/government hellscape, which is for the most part insolvent and doesn‚Äôt know it yet.  The best thing a white person can do is find a career where he‚Äôs not owned by this monstrosity.

        the motivation here is envy. The very existence of white people is a daily reminder of the failure of all others to accomplish much of anything, despite being blessed with the best the earth has to offer.important point here, Z. The envy and inferiority complex (as well as identity issues) that non-whites have is so large most whites can‚Äôt comprehend. It may manifest itself as white worship, or white hatred. 2 sides of the same coin.they hate / envy whites more than they love themselves (see black support for mass immigration). Theyll gladly suffer as long as they make whites suffer too. As their numbers grow in our society, they feel more alienated, not less.

            Since Zman referenced this from Sobran on envy, here is the actual:‚ÄúThe concept of envy ‚Äî the hatred of the superior ‚Äî has dropped out of our moral vocabulary. The idea that white Christian civilization is hated more for its virtues than its sins doesn‚Äôt occur to us, because it‚Äôs not a nice idea. Western man towers over the rest of the world in ways so large as to be almost inexpressible. It‚Äôs Western exploration, science, and conquest that have revealed the world to itself. Other races feel like subjects of western power long after colonialism, imperialism and slavery have disappeared. The charge of racism puzzles whites who feel not hostility, but only baffled good will, because they don‚Äôt grasp what it really means: humiliation. The white man presents an image of superiority even when he isn‚Äôt conscious of it. Superiority excites envy. Destroying white civilization is the inmost desire of the league of designated victims we call ‚Äòminorities.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äî Joseph Sobran (April 1997)

                    Have not read all her fiction, but Rand did portray the delusions, dogma and dictatorship of Leftist ideology well, especially inAtlas Shrugged. Exceptionally well, in the contrast between the hard-working capitalist vs. the slimy, go-along-get-along socialist. Not much about race back in the 1950s, although one of her heroes is adagoArgentine of Italian ancestry. üôÇ

                I think it is on Netflix, about the only decent show was Last Kingdom.  Surprisingly, depicted Viking ravaged Britain with no blacks (at least, none of note that I could remember).
Stopped watching Britannia (I think that was the one) after 10 minutes when the opening scenes had two Roman soldiers, one white, one black, caught deserting or something.  One tried to cowardly get out of doing his duty; the other ‚Äúmanfully‚Äù stepping up to his responsibility.  Guess which one was the black Roman?

            They‚Äôve proposed 100% chocolate remakes of Friends, The Golden Girls and other shows too. Part of this might be the budget savings aspect: for a lot of the remade shows they‚Äôll be able to splice together footage of shootings at black funerals.
Besides the erasure of White Uighurs, Hollywood‚Äôs decline into endless remakes and redos is also telling: civilization has decayed to the point where there is no longer any innovation or investment in the future, just the strip mining of ancient accomplishments, as in Africa.

                        It‚Äôs funny and it has a great heart underneath it all.  Also, it‚Äôs a great example of how men should bond together over common interests and struggles.  Sadly, the remake is true.

                    They‚Äôve already done that with the Honeymooners and The Twilight Zone, in large part. There are lots of other examples. A full list of them would shock you. The ruling class is buying off the barbarians at their gates with cheap knock off remakes of things whites made in order to close the difference between the demographics that can create and those that have not. Envy plays a role, but so does self preservation. This will grow worse in the future.

            Agreed.  Other than Marge‚Äôs wonderfully childlike lecturing of how it is wrong to put people in a wood chopper, the film was nihilistic buffoonery. The Big Lebowski was similar in that regard though the humor wasn‚Äôt bad. The only Cohen brothers movies I can actually say I love is Oh Brother, Where Art Thou and Raising Arizona.

        Simon Webb just posted a video to YouTube about blackwashing (he didn‚Äôt use the term) in British TV and movies.  There was a new British production of David Copperfield that just featured an Indian named Patel in the lead role.  He had another example of a show set in a boarding school in the 40s where half the characters were non white.  A couple of years ago, I watched a show on Smithsonian that had originally aired in Britain about the Norman invasion of England.  The lead advisor to William the Conqueror was black.  This was one of the great things about the movie Dunkirk, Christopher Nolan didn‚Äôt do any of this.

                    That subway scene was an outrage, lol.  My family will not watch movies with me now.  I admit my eyerolling and gagging sounds grow tiresome but when that scene came on i was triggered.  Becoming a regular crank.  Will admit to some  pleasure when i get a speculative sidewise glance from my older kids when the sassy, yet wise, black lesbian archetype invariable appears in some drama. Sometimes i regret educating my kids to what a ridiculous clown show we live within. Increasingly i find myself incredulous how surreal and odds with reality everything is.  It is like the entire society is undergoing a delusional psychic break.  Dislocating as hell.

                        OT but figure you guys might like this: Oldest daughter (20yrs) called last night.  She going to school in Knoxville.  Some youngish homeless guy was bugging her outside a restaurant.  Ended up grabbing her butt and she started yelling at the guy.  She tells me that some  big dude who had been apparently watching the goings on came out of the restaurant at a trot.  He asked  her the somewhat classic , ‚Äúis there a problem here?‚Äù She ‚Äúyeah, this guy just grabbed my butt‚Äù  She incredulously- ‚Äù dad, the guy didn‚Äôt even stop, he just walked up the bum and punched him in the face‚Äù  At which point she got scared and hauled ass to her car.   Good girl, although i sorta wish she had thanked the guy. She said that she could hear the bum  apologizing as a she was bookin it.  Two points 1. I love TN 2.  No woman should be out alone these days without a guy (preferably one that can handle themselves).  What a shame.  It wasn‚Äôt like that not so long ago.

                Coloured soldiers were recruited from the various European colonies. They were assigned to white officers and served in their own units. There were few integrated coloured, mostly in the French Army. Some gave a good account of themselves, for example the Gurkhas.

                In defense of the Sikhs, they were all over the place‚Äìbut yes in their own units.  Were the primary troops used by Allenby in the Levant.  To their credit the Sikh Regiment may have been the most decorated unit in the Colonial Army.  Excellent soldiers and martial tradition.  The current British army considered creating a domestic Sikh regiment recently (with their support) but was shot down by the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù.  If I‚Äôm picking teams and have a lot of choices, one would be some Sikhs.

                        Since I don‚Äôt have the patience to scroll through 200 pages of results, I will have to cite from memory an article about a small English village utterly taken over by Sikhs. And quote from a different article referring to the half a million Sikhs in England who don‚Äôt feel ‚Äòrepresented‚Äô because there are no Sikhs in parliament. They may have been good colonial soldiers, but they are not and never will be English and they should not be living in England. They are like every other ethnic group and I don‚Äôt choose to ally with any of them.

                It‚Äôs not totally inaccurate.  The French and British used ‚Äúcolonial‚Äù troops almost right from the outset of the war.  Whether there would be a Sikh in the same unit that is otherwise all English might be debateable ‚Äì but the fact that there were black troops being used is not.Good article with some of the background :https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/11/david-olusoga-black-soldiers-first-world-war-expendableI found the part about Lothrup Stoddard‚Äôs opinion of the war (he was head of the Massachusetts chapter of the KKK ‚Äì and a Harvard graduate) ‚Äì particularly interesting.They didn‚Äôt HAVE TO throw black troops in there ‚Äì but it‚Äôs also not blackwashing on the level of making historical characters who were white ‚Äì into blacks.

            Someone recommended I watch a ‚ÄúBritish comedy‚Äù I think called ‚ÄúYesterday‚Äù. The plot was a guy named Patel (or just played by a guy named Patel) gets hit by lightening and when he comes to he realizes he‚Äôs the only one on earth who remembers the Beatles and their catalog. He becomes rich and famous pretending he is the genius behind the work as he can sing and play guitar. There is an older British couple who also must have been lighteninged since they too remember, but when they confront Patel about his theft and deceit instead of threatening to expose him they are just happy he brought the songs back so others could enjoy them. Sort of like a good curry. I found this movie perverse and such a slap in the face to Brits. They‚Äôre getting it worse than Americans at the moment.

                I thought the setting for ‚ÄúYesterday‚Äù was Australia, with a visit to England to pay homage to the Beatles inspirational landmarks. In any event, it was a clever story-line. I admit, it put me off wrt the lead character‚Äôs love story (White girl, Indian boy), but it was much less in your face and the primary focus than most.My impression is that it started from the assumption that all race differences are behind us and any two people can get together. The families of the two love interests were identical in social function, behavior, and SES level‚Äîjust like you and me, only different races. Utopia achieved. That struck me. Completely the opposite of what we usually see in American produced crap‚Äîwhere minority disfunction is celebrated and normalized and the Whites on top are in some manner disfunctional.

                    The love interest, etc. was irritating but not the main offense. The thing was done to have an Indian appropriate something iconically British and nobody cares. The not noticing is the offense. Not even by the actual Brits who know the secret! Because it was cute and lighthearted made it all the more contemptible.

                        True, but the entire world (in the movie) did not know that any of the music was purloined from the Beatles.  The Beatles were unknown to the general public‚Äîexcept the other two or three British folks who ‚Äúremembered‚Äù.  Actually, remembered can‚Äôt be the proper description as all trace of the Beatles in the human record was missing.  Had to be some sort of parallel universe sci-fi stuff.As to the movie itself and the music played‚Äîas remembered by the Indian costar‚Äîit was also interesting.  I had never really heard, or got into the lyrics before, as a younger Beatles fan.  It was like hearing it once again for the first time and having an increased appreciation for the group.

        Multiculturalism was always just a precursor to black supremacy. In making white civilization just one of many cultures, the multiculturalists derogated civilization. This was hardly an act of kindness to whites. Now the multiculti have dispensed with any nice-guy charades, and actively seek to subjugate whites, divest us of all power, and transfer it to blacks. Herein lies a lesson: never trusts Leftists, even when their claims are apparently benign. There is always an evilarriere pensee.

            Asking civilization to survive when separated from whites is like asking a rose to survive when separated from the stem.  You can‚Äôt divest something that you‚Äôre incapable of keeping alive.  You‚Äôre not going to have a bunch of Kamalas holding anything together.  They only exist in their places because they‚Äôre allowed to exist in a system that hasn‚Äôt yet failed.  And it‚Äôs dying every day.

        I think a lot of TV shows have a multi-season bait-and-switch strategy. The early seasons are built on solid dramatic principles, and so lure in lots of viewers. Then they intentionally pile in the pozz once people are hooked.
The Walking Dead in its later years, for example, ‚Äúcelebrated‚Äù the fact that all of the relationships were gay or interracial.

        Afrikaners are often the villains in Hollywood productions. It‚Äôs been a good living for Arnold Vosloo, although they typically don‚Äôt cast someone as hot as Charlize Theron as the baddie.

            IIRC, the guy who wrote the first three seasons quit, so they probably brought a team from Diversity Camp to make the black version. That would explain why it is hackey. The first season was quite good for TV. The Malvo character was well drawn.
The general rule with these high-end dramas is they should never go more than three seasons.

                Something like this happened to the showWestworld. The first season was excellent. It played into many traditional tropes of the genre. Then Donald Trump got elected, and they brought in different writers; they wokefied it. The strong wahmen POC don‚Äôt need no man to rescue them now. The female characters are strong and empowered sociopaths with poor motivations. The male villain from the first season is suddenly incompetent, and it‚Äôs not even about the old West anymore but Japan. Pathetic.Same thing happened to Star Trek: Discovery. You know, the one with a strong empowered black female lead who‚Äôs the best at everything, puts down the male characters and was named ‚ÄúMichael.‚Äù Seriously, a man‚Äôs name. There are multiple YouTube videos taking this thing apart, so I‚Äôll spare the details. Just know this stuff has to be coordinated propaganda because the audience has rejected it. They put it on CBS network television recently and it got a 0.2 share among the core demographic. Laughable. When it first premiered, it got over ten million viewers.‚Äúso they probably brought a team from Diversity Camp to make the black version. That would explain why it is hackey.‚ÄùThey did the same thing for Star Trek: Discovery. The target audience for that franchise is overwhelmingly white male, so of course they brought in as many white women in the writing room and as many diversity hires in the director position as they could find. They even told a previous white male director they wouldn‚Äôt hire him because he‚Äôs white. He went to work for The Orville.

                Jackie Gleason was asked why he cancelled the Honeymooners after one great season (39 episodes in those days). He said he saw that the writers were struggling at the end and he couldn‚Äôt expect to wring more out of them.

                    If you are Gen X from the north east, you grew up watchingThe Odd CoupleandThe Honeymoonersback to back on WPIX every night.  Two great shows.Is it fair, though, to criticize Gleason for the fact that his show promoted the stereotype of the shiftless, slovenly, incurious man who is married to a much wiser (and beautiful) woman?  He didn‚Äôt invent the dynamic, it was a staple of the radio era too, in shows likeFibber McGee and Mollyfor example, but TV sitcoms have gone back to that premise over and over.  And today, anything with a whiff of humor to it uses men as the butt of its jokes.  How much of that is The Great One‚Äôs fault?

        The blackwashing has been normalized in entertainment and sports. It will next move into other aspects of life. Whether or not that can be normalized is an open question, as someone has to keep the plates spinning. More important, will white people keep letting themselves be pushed off the stage of life? The pessimist says yes, whites would rather be dead than rude. The optimists say that eventually, whites wake up and take back their lands from the blackwashers‚Ä¶As despicable as blackwashing is in sports and entertainment, it gets even more insidious when it happens in academia and history is rewritten to reflect lies. In the United Kingdom, the Guardian and other purported ‚Äúnews‚Äù organizations have started to push myths as historical ‚Äúfacts,‚Äù such as claiming there were numerous blacks among the Norman conquest, to cite one ridiculous example I came across recently; historians soon will teach it as fact. It will happen here soon enough. ‚ÄúHamilton‚Äù will transition from a stupid Broadway musical to historical ‚Äúfact.‚ÄùEither way, the reality of this age is we have moved beyond the quest for diversity into the beginnings of the vengeance phase. The daily attacks on whites going about their business and the evolution of Jim Snow laws are parts of it. The blackwashing is another part of it. Ethnic cleansing is not just about removing the people, but also about removing their culture. It takes a special hatred to erase a people from the book of life and that is the point of the blackwashing.The next to final stage of genocide is removing vestiges of a racial group‚Äôs history. Get ready, this is happening already.

        Slightly adjacent to ‚Äúblack washing‚Äù.I have been an Amazon customer for nearly 20 years and a Prime subscriber since it was first offered. Somewhere in a computer, Amazon knows every physical and Kindle book I have bought from them and every TV show and movie I have watched on streaming Prime Video. One of the ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù of Amazon products is that they make recommendations based on your past reading/viewing/purchasing/reviewing habits.Since June of this year, every time I go to Amazon sites, the first page is full of blackety-black recommendations for me ‚Äì blackety-black books, blackety-black shows, blackety-black movies.These people know (or at least their computers do) I have no history of interest in blackety-black stuff. I read mostly history, philosophy and literature ‚Äì none by black authors; I watch pre-1960 Westerns and Classic films ‚Äì nothing blackety-black.They are no longer recommending what I might enjoy based on the products I have previously enjoyed and rated, but rather what I SHOULD enjoy, what‚Äôs GOOD-FOR-ME. It‚Äôs tedious and insulting.

        White males are overwhelmingly the best creators of anything considered ‚Äúart‚Äù in the West. A few years back, I read somewhere that around 83% of best selling new, non-romance, novels were written by white men. The same is true of everything from movies to videogames to stage plays. When there is an exception to that, it‚Äôs almost always a white female, although there are occasional exceptions (but that‚Äôs mostly just Jordan Peele-eque race hate).Creators create for themselves as much as their audience. Thus, the old saying ‚Äúyou write what you know.‚Äù If white males cannot write for themselves (i.e. create white characters and white situations), then they cannot create. Thus, this creative dead end the book industry, comic books and Hollywood finds themselves in. Increasingly (shockingly), this is true of even much narratively simpler video games. Only remakes can be made in this environment because nothing new can be created.Think about it, if you‚Äôre a gifted script writer would you really waste years of your time, and that‚Äôs how long it takes to make some of this stuff, only to have your work 1) never see the light of day because it‚Äôs not woke enough ‚Ä¶ and yes, that happens 2) attacked on social media for one of countless reasons that merely mask the fact that you are being attacked for being a white male 3) stolen from you and altered to include race / gender swaps because too many of the wrong demographic was included originally?Artists reflect the culture they live in. The coming Darkest Age doesn‚Äôt allow creative demographics to be creative, for multiple reasons. So, nothing gets made. It‚Äôll be interesting to see where this all goes. My predictions: 1) slowly, white males will begin creating subversive things 2) the Chinese will fund and / or start their own global entertainment industry that surpasses Hollywood. I think the latter is a distinct possibility considering the enormous size and growing technical sophistication of that market.

                That‚Äôs one of the reasons for the popularity of Japanese anime in the West, especially North America. All of the characters are either Asian or vaguely White. It‚Äôs comforting not to see so much odious black and brown fake diversity because there is now a Pavlovian-like association with anti-White hate whenever you see that stuff on American television.

        One rarely sees mixed marriages in Germany unless it‚Äôs the pseudo-intellectual, nouveau riche crowd who are trying to make a human fashion statement. Any ethnic German male who‚Äôs seen with a Black, Asian or non-white woman is considered the lowest of the low. And is generally considered to be of such poor character that he has been rejected by all white females. The ultimate outcast of German society.The only people in German society who are one step lower on the social ladder are the ‚Äúdo-gooders‚Äù who travel abroad and bring home orphaned non-white children. These children are often so disturbed both physically or mentally they cause nothing but trouble for everyone. These are the marriages that also have the highest rate of divorce due to the problems these children cause in the relationship. Especially since these relationships almost always include a sub-beta-male who‚Äôs only there to look cool or hip until things get uncomfortable.However you will see mixed couples in France or Belgium especially in the larger cities. But almost always the lower ‚Äúwhite trash‚Äù levels of society in the poorer ‚Äúhigh-rise‚Äù areas. Unlike Germans, at least the French elites have some lines even they won‚Äôt cross.One could argue this growing mix-race trend is just another symptom of Oikophobia. A trend we see not only being forced upon us, but widely promoted, encouraged and accepted in political and academic circles.I find the whole topic of Oikophobia quite interesting as it explains a great deal about what we are seeing in the West, and especially in America.

        Here‚Äôs the Sobran piece that, I think,best elucidates his views.Keep a copy- Come the revolution, this may be the Shibboleth of the movement.https://www.thefreedictionary.com/shibboleth‚ÄúWestern man towers over the rest of the world in ways so large as to be almost inexpressible. It‚Äôs Western exploration, science, and conquest that have revealed the world to itself.Other races feel like subjects of Western power long after colonialism, imperialism, and slavery have disappeared.The charge of racism puzzles whites who feel not hostility, but only baffled good will, because they don‚Äôt grasp what it really means: humiliation.The white man presents an image of superiority even when he isn‚Äôt conscious of it.And, superiority excites envy.Destroying white civilization is the inmost desire of the league of designated victims we call minorities.‚ÄùJoseph Sobran, April 1997

        Yeah, we are in a vengeance phase, but I think we are further along than just the beginning.  It‚Äôs become more visible because the optics have been stretched beyond reality in order to keep moving the envelope. To me affirmative action was more vengeance than quest, since it was a legal dictate.  It all seems like a quest for vengeance.

        Dinosaurs like Biden, Schumer, and Pelosi are still calling the shots within the Democrat Party, and the Elites running Hollywood, the MSM, and social media are still trying desperately to re-wire the masses as woke sheeple.

There haven‚Äôt been any two people in 50 years who‚Äôve gotten together and said, ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt whites way better? Shouldn‚Äôt we rule over other people?‚Äù‚Äôuh, yes.

I say it all the time.  It‚Äôs simply a fact of life like the sky is blue that whites are immensely talented and make the best societies, art, and music, among much else.
Supremacy, at its root, simply means ‚Äúbetter than‚Äù
If the white man‚Äôs language, in this case English, weren‚Äôt ‚Äúbetter than‚Äù then the whole world wouldn‚Äôt be speaking it and if our music isn‚Äôt better than then Asians wouldn‚Äôt be strapping their kids into chair‚Äôs to master Bach and Beethoven.

                    Put simply, I‚Äôm not one for words and preaching. I‚Äôm one for resultsShe‚Äôs just a pundit, an entertainer.  One minute she‚Äôs telling us how we can‚Äôt live without Mitt Romney, then Chris Christie, then one minute she‚Äôs kissing Trump‚Äôs ass then another trashing him.  Is that the kind of person you follow?  That‚Äôs a confused girl in a woman‚Äôs body going from schoolyard crush to schoolyard crush.   She‚Äôs got mental problems.And as much as I like Rush Limbaugh ‚Äî or used to listen to him quite a bit ‚Äî there is no denying that his popularity coincided with this country becoming more and more of what he preached against.  The more he screamed ‚Äúsocialism,‚Äù the more it became socialist.  The more Coulter screamed ‚Äúimmigration,‚Äù the worse it got.  Not saying it‚Äôs deliberate, but there‚Äôs no denying the phenomena.  There‚Äôs also no denying she got rich because of it.  So does she really want it to stop?Lastly, it‚Äôs a pet peeve of mine living out here in California where we have been fighting against illegal immigration for decades on a grass roots level.  The pet peeve is that the ones always screaming the loudest were/are the ones with no children, or no ‚Äúskin in the game‚Äù as they say.  I have always been a little untrusting of them.  They just don‚Äôt pass the smell test.

                    One other thing, No I don‚Äôt see ‚Äúwhite supremacy‚Äù as you do.  That negative connotation you associate with it and presume others do too is simply a mistake on your part.  Pardon me, but I know enough Latin and Italian that when I see a Latin word like supremacy I see it as it was meant to be seen.  And I know I am not alone.  Not all of us let the American media dictate to us our language.  Remember also that some of us older guys are actually educated in the classics, many of us shun TV, and we are going to use words differently.

        Yep. One of the most overplayed commercials in recent year [Jake from State Farm] has now been transformed via black magic into a newer darker Jake.They didn‚Äôt even explain how he magically transformed. A black tennis player, Sloane Stephens, did this ad for chocolate milk a year ago (isn‚Äôt that racist by today‚Äôs standards?) and they could have showed Jake chug one of those to transform, because I‚Äôm still confused what happened to lighter skinned Jake.Funny how blackface has been verboten this year from any light skinned people (i.e. late night show hosts) but the media/corporate power can now make whiteface a blackface.

        Saw a YouTube commercial for a Hulu movie calledBad Hair.Plot involves young negro woman acquiring a weave to assist her career.  The weave turns out to be cursed and, I guess, turns her into an angry Black woman with supernatural powers.you just would not have seen this kind of entertainment back in the old days.Also, I have not seen a commercial; print, video, audio or skywriting, that does not feature a negro in a long time.

        At least 30 years ago Hollywood made an effort to explain the presence of the token ahistorical Negro in a way that made sense to the story.I‚Äôm thinking of Morgan Freeman‚Äôs character as Kevin Costner‚Äôs sidekick in ‚ÄúRobin Hood: Prince of Thieves.‚Äù They needed to add a black, so they start the story out with Robin in the Holy Land, fighting the Crusades, and he picks up a Magic Negro in the form of a traitorous (to the Muslims) Mohammedan. Seems like a lot of extra work just add a black to Robin‚Äôs band of Merry Men, but I appreciate the effort and I‚Äôll allow it. He‚Äôs a completely new character and he‚Äôs not taking anything away from the other, established Merry Men.Nowadays they‚Äôd just cast Terry Crews as Little John with no explanation and you‚Äôd be the jerk for noticing.

                He was just the largest sized black actor I could think of off the type of my head.  Besides, they‚Äôll either be gender- swapping the lead role of Robin or making Robin a homosexual or (probably) both.

        It must be very confusing for the young and the innocent. On the one hand, White Supremacy has crushed the negro race for countless generations into lives of hopelessness and unendurable misery. The American revolution was fought to enshrine slavery for all time. Emmitt Till (and his father) get lynched every day in America in the continuing legacy of White privilege.On the other hand, King Lear was a black dude, so was Robin Hood and his merry men and the whole cast of medieval Europe right down to Ned the bell ringer. And today blacks live charming gracious suburban lives in $2 million mansions with new Lexi tied in a bow waiting in the drive every Christmas. Whew! Even I‚Äôm confused.

        On some level, the JJJ push of homosexuality gives them an easy way to make money.  They don‚Äôt have to change the format of sitcoms, for example, just use the same time proven formula but insert homosexuals or blacks into the roles.   No thinking needed.  No creativity needed.  Just switch around the actors and voila.  Money for Heim and Berg

            Some are saying this is terrible timing for him.  I disagree.  November 2nd would have been terrible timing for him as it would have dissuaded some from voting for him; the true believers thinking to themselves, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt vote for him, he‚Äôs going to be dead in a week!‚ÄùThis, on the other hand, is very good timing.  It‚Äôs going to suck all the air out of the room, burying the Proud Boys theater.  Reports are he‚Äôs asymptomatic.  In mid-October he‚Äôll be pronounced healthy, he can promote HCQ/Z-pack, and give a big Nelson laugh to all the ghouls who are busy this morning wishing him dead.

Diversified remake of the all-white male original.The Witcher. Netflix live action adaptation of an all-white European fantasy. The original production specifically set out to race-swap key roles. However, they slightly dialed it back by casting non-whites that weren‚Äôt as obvious.Now, remember this is a short list. It misses many instances where single characters in larger productions have been race or gender-swapped. For example, in one of the GI Joe movies they race-swapped the white male character of Snake Eyes. Also, I believe one of the Sherlock Holmes adaptations features a race and gender-swapped Watson.This removing of white male characters seems to be a pattern. Funny how this regime has been simultaneously tearing down statues of white men while museums are also selling off classic Jackson Pollack paintings to make room for non-whites. Is there a connection here?Many of these projects have failed dramatically. So, why does Hollywood keep this up?My theory: profit is no longer a motive. The far-left now controls so much of society, including the media that critiques this stuff and the finance sectors that fund it, that one MUST tow the line to get anything made. With so many people and so few positions, the best way to do that is by proving your loyalty to the ruling dogma whenever you get the chance, namely by race and gender-swapping roles and making a big deal about it. Those who want to make a name for themselves have to promote the narrative in order to be noticed and get promoted.This same thing happened in the old Soviet Union. Those who wished to advanced had to prove their loyalty to the party and their doctrine. Results (a good economy, efficient manufacturing, public approval) was secondary. The same is now true of Hollywood. The big media companies know the democrat party, now synonymous with the government, will never let them go bankrupt because they are valuable propaganda outlets. So, there is no longer any motive to be truthful to the property; they figure the will race and gender-swap things, bank on the name recognition and then make up for any shortfall with marketing and CGI. Thus, wokeness in everything.

            Am I alone in seeing James Bond as very effective multi-cultural agitprop?  Although I love the movies, they were important in selling Americans on the idea of you can find allies and friends in every race and creed the world over.  It was a soft sell but a sell nonetheless.

                That was true of a lot of television shows and movies.Star Trektricked impressionable white men into thinking they‚Äôd still have a place in a diverse society, not banned from applying for positions with the new shows.Alien Nationled white males into believing it was cool and virtuous to defend aliens, often racist in their own attitudes, against the provocations of stereotyped white supremacists.John Grishamled Southerners to think their society deserved to be destroyed because it was racist and immoral.Robocopled white men into thinking Detroit‚Äôs real problem was evil white male corporate executives. Countless other films showed the white man being friends and partners of non-whites:Predator,Commando,Aliens,The Matrix,Die Hard, and countless others. Countless movies likeCrimson TideandThe Shawshank Redemptionled white men into thinking black men were repositories of superior wisdom.Now that the Left has won, there is no longer any reason to keep up pretenses. The ruling class simply takes from them and rubs their faces in it knowing they are powerless to fight back.‚ÄúNana nana boo boo, tricked you.

        Dr. Seuss‚ÄôsCat in the Hat(1957) features a pair of siblings, a boy (the story‚Äôs unnamed narrator) and his sister Sally, who are unsettled by the Cat‚Äôs antics.We finally find out the name of the boy in the spinoff showThe Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!(2010-) which you can see on PBS Kids. No, actually, we never find out his name. We never see him at all. He has been replaced by Nick, Sally‚Äôs neighbor.According to Wikipedia: Nickis ‚Äúa¬†seven-year-old boy. He is Sally‚Äôs next door neighbor and best friend, though he is not the same boy seen in the book.

        The same people blackwashing films and television shows are ethnically cleansing white societies with mass immigration.
The white pill is that they often overshoot and the golem gets out of control:https://twitter.com/neolib_fanfic/status/1312051807414255619
Shame that they lack the self-reflection and introspection to avoid setting golems all over the place in the first place, though. For example, they‚Äôre shocked, shocked that they‚Äôre getting chased out of France by Muslims!

        No tv, no movies, skip over vibrant commercials online.  The oversaturation has to be intentional.  My money is erased from said blackwashing.  Interestingly,  Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben and other iconic figures are erased from product packaging.  Pancake mix, cream of wheat and butter will survive.  Not sure about the other stuff.

                Checking it out now.  Burger Kangz recently had an incident where the service was too slow, so the death penalty was applied.  Staying away from fast food places now, too.  (I live in So MD, not the good part).

        Since I moved to your neck of the woods‚ÄîMaryland‚Äîfrom the inland west, I am still in total shock at the number of interracial couples there are here. The other thing I noticed, having grown up in Detroit in the 1970s in proximity to black folk, is that many of the blacks I encounter no longer speak in ‚Äújive‚Äù and actually speak like whitey.

            Interracial couples remain a trivial reality. What you see around here is bottom of the barrel white women with black men. The hard sell on it by the media is having the desired effect. Just another part of the pogrom against whites.

                I always thought the miscegenation was where the most normies are on our side. I remember my dad who is a boomer GOP type totally Fox News Watcher and rarely brings up race but even he would mention I just think a White woman marrying a Black man brings up all of these problems and is not desirable.

                    It just doesn‚Äôt happen that much, even in Toronto which is like 30% white in the dating age category.
You see an occasional white guy with an Asian or Indian woman, or a white woman with a black man. I‚Äôm also seeing an increase of post-wall white women with a nice-guy brown beta.
But race mixing just doesn‚Äôt happen on a mass scale, outside of college dorms. Actions &gt; words.

                    We have the opposite in our family ‚Äî my Ivy League grad brother-in-law‚Äôs oldest son married a black girl, Nigerian dad and Trinidadian mom.  Guess where they had met?  At a posh, now co-ed Connecticut prep school from which the boy‚Äôs father AND grandfather had graduated.  Grandfather is long dead so he never got to meet the ‚Äúnew‚Äù inlaws!  I have to say that she‚Äôs a cool and very smart girl, avoiding the bums from her race.  Interesting how she culled her future hubby from the pack as he was/is a geek.  They do love each other and have a cafe-au-lait baby girl, twenty times lighter skinned than Mom, which I‚Äôm sure secretly pleases her.

                Wish I could regard the phenomenon as trivial in Chicago. Here, what I see are at least a quarter of couples clearly dating or in a relationship are interracial. I‚Äôm even bumping into white male-black female commonly and that was extremely rare even five years ago. And I‚Äôm witnessing beautiful, wealthy young white women paired with well-dressed, smoove talkin‚Äô black dudes. It‚Äôs a real thang here sadly.

                    Farther east in the rust belt, it‚Äôs certainly common, but the white women are almost exclusively fatted and tatted.  It‚Äôs always the grandparents I pity.  I don‚Äôt feel sorry for them as they should have cut their daughters off or dragged them away, but you watch them carting around their mystery meat grandkids and you can see in their eyes that this isn‚Äôt what they planned.

            In truth, interracial marriages remain rare in the United States (&lt;16%) and the West. Many of the American couplings involve minority with minority or Whites with White-Hispanic. I cannot put my hands on an exact breakdown, but if black-White marriages constitute even half of the 16 percent in the States it would be a shock. The only state where it is common, and for obvious reasons, is Hawaii and that generally involves Asians with islanders and Whites. The Japanese and Koreans there, though, seldom marry outside their ethnicities.Due to this, I expect to see the heat turned up on Whites to marry other races. There was some stupid NYT columnist recently who encouraged White males to date and mate with blacks females. The best I could disentangle from her demand was it would serve as some whacked out form of reparations. It will get serious when White couples on campuses begin to be ostracized, and if it hasn‚Äôt happened yet it will soon. That will be a hot button.

                ‚ÄúHispanic‚Äù is better understood as a spectrum, rather than a race.

                    Correct, you run the gambit from Oaxacan Indian at 5 foot tall with hat size of 5‚Ä¶ to blond cremo/a Guadalajaran with green eyes and Irish pale skin. A lot of folks in middle America see their local illegal alien encampment near a meat packing plant and think they understand Mexico.

                        Yes, very true of Hispanic culture. In Spanish LIt we studied ‚ÄúParece Blanca‚Äù (‚ÄúShe Looks White‚Äù) by (uh‚Ä¶googling‚Ä¶) a play by Cuban Abelardo Estorino. If I recall, part of the plot is to marry a white, to ‚Äúwhiten‚Äù the children. This actually is (was) part of the culture. Also, these cultures didn‚Äôt just have a ‚Äúone drop rule‚Äù like America. Oh no. You were white, mulatto, quadroon, octaroon, etc. I‚Äôve been told, and wouldn‚Äôt dare to try it, that one of the worst insults against a (White) Latino would be to imply he had Negro ancestry. Right up there with insulting Mom.

                How is 16% or so trivial?  That could produce a cohort of half breeds that will in turn intermarry (miscegenation) and have children.  The cancer spreads.  One can only hope that they identify with their non-White race and merge back in.  We don‚Äôt need more Megan Markles.

                    Compsci ‚Äì a thousand upvotes.  Far too many trivialize these things, but the slippery slope is real.  Even those fat and tatted White women ought not to be breeding with other races.  White women have treated White men abominably, but only a White mother can have a White child.  That should not ever be compromised.

                        On the bright side, the chances of interbreds reproducing further (other than sinking back into the nonwhite milieu) seems very low, and seems to normally be a ‚Äúone and done‚Äù genetic branch.

                            In addition to a thousand other topics, Fuerle (Erectus Walks Amongst Us) covered this. Of course he‚Äôs writing from a pro-white perspective. His claim is that hybrids (race mixing) typically produces bad results, not just disapproving parents üôÇ . Even if there is ‚Äúhybrid vigor‚Äù, this is just the first generation, and subsequent ones have much less chance of having ‚Äúgood‚Äù pairs of alleles (genes) matching up. If this is true, then the Afro-American is at a distinct disadvantage, being roughly 20-25% caucasian and other races thrown in with the probably several native African ones.

            Negroes in MD probably overwhelmingly work for the federal government. So they are probably more familiar with standard American English. They probably speak differently when no whites are around. I remember getting supplies out of the supply room at work when two negroes who I knew to speak normal English entered (unaware of my presence) and broke into Ebonics.

As far as the Zman and the JQ, he mentions ‚Äòanti-semites‚Äô an awful lot for someone who accepts the reality of what they are doing.

Not naming them in this day and age is one thing, but going out of your way to badmouth people who are aware of them??

                    Not to speak for Z, but since this situation comes up ad nauseum (and I‚Äôve made plenty of comments just like your‚Äôs), let me give you my reasons that I converted to Z‚Äôs use of discretion at times.First, everyone who‚Äôs been here more than a week knows who generally runs the show, whether media, politics, finance, etc. Z harping on it isn‚Äôt necessary.We also know how much a certain extremely influential portion of said group hates us and wants our people turned to Helots at best and dissolved away at worst. Again, Z doesn‚Äôt need to beat that issue to death. We get it.Second, Z is talking to two different audiences so he needs to straddle that line. Think of some slowly awakening Joe Normie who found his way to this site. He‚Äôs still in the CivNat, color-blind society mode ‚Äì though doubts are creeping in.This guy isn‚Äôt ready for the full truth. He needs time to process what‚Äôs going on. It took me years to reach this point. You don‚Äôt deprogram to cult member in an article. You start showing cracks in their belief system and let me work it out on their own. Push too hard or too fast, and they‚Äôll block you out.And if there‚Äôs one thing that will make Joe Normie run faster than anything, it‚Äôs a feeling that he‚Äôs around a bunch of Neo-Nazis. Stupid? Sure. But it‚Äôs true.If we want to grow our numbers and, particularly, if we want to grow our numbers of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people, the kinds of people you need to create something worthwhile, we have appear ‚Äúnormal‚Äù in their eyes. Ranting about some ethnic group controlling the world doesn‚Äôt fit that bill.Finally, we can win this thing playing our own game. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. Even when you play your own game, you still need to think about your opponents. But if we just do the things that we need to do, i.e. build communities, we can win.Will a certain group do everything that they can to stop us from doing that? Sure. But we know who they are and what tools they have. We‚Äôve figured that out. If we just focus on what we need to do, we‚Äôll get to where we need to go.Z likes to take about positive identity vs negative identity. Positive identity will allow us to grow. Negative identity is a dead end.Focusing on community and heritage are positive identity. Focusing on some other group and how they‚Äôre keeping you down ‚Äì even if it‚Äôs true ‚Äì is negative identity.That‚Äôs not to say that you can‚Äôt have a bit of negative identity thrown in with a heaping of positive identity.I like to use the bully example. Say a bully is pushing you around at school. You hate that guy, i.e. negative identity. But if the bully gets you to go to the gym and take Krav Maga lessons, which, in turn, make you a healthier, more confident person who‚Äôs made new friends, well, you‚Äôre now on the positive identity path, even to the point that you don‚Äôt really care or worry about the bully anymore.White gentiles need to stop worry about the bully and start hitting the gym. We‚Äôre dramatically stronger and more athletic than the bully. He doesn‚Äôt stand a chance if we just do what we need to do.Anyway, that‚Äôs my 2 cents on the subject.

                        I‚Äôm so glad you said this.  I was about to make the same point.  Making everything about Jews is the reason the early WN‚Äôs got nowhere and ended up as the proverbial angry, bitter loners.  It also plays into a strong point of the Jews themselves which is their understanding of psychology and ability to manipulate people through it.The martial arts point is one I don‚Äôt think I would have made though but it‚Äôs apt on many levels.  If an opponent can get you to focus your attention on some one thing he does, maybe a ‚Äúsignature move‚Äù, he can then attack you in lots of other ways while you prepare to defend against that one thing.I‚Äôd like to say that one thing we need in our people is some kind of specific training in thementalside of this game too.  Too many of us have too little control over our reactions to things and are not mindful of our thoughts.  For me, for instance, it‚Äôs the masks.  TheyREALLY, REALLYpiss me off to the point where I can‚Äôt help but feel disgusted and oppressed even when I don‚Äôt wear one myself but I see people around me wearing them.  I‚Äôm sure this is part of the intended effect of course.  The masks are partly to mask whatever else the bastards in charge are cooking up.  I‚Äôd really like to see us develop a simple program of mental focus and self control to avoid obsessive thought patterns and redirect our attentions to those things that are in our sphere of control rather than the ones that aren‚Äôt.  Everyone‚Äôs sphere of control is a little nation of its own that has a long, sinuous border with the enemy‚Äôs territory.  Once secured, this nation can be expanded ‚Äì at the enemy‚Äôs expense.

                    Well. Look at the positive side. Adolph left us some job to do and go to the history as heroes‚Ä¶:D. For general information. Thuggish Eastern European Nazis seen in movies are pretty popular down here. Such we are and proud of this. You can`t win communism with intellectual arguments. Also comfort lies do not work, especially myth about evil Nazis and good war.

                        I know this, I know a lot of Germans and they never struck me as the kind of people who would burn 6 million people in ovens.  At the same time, I know a lot of JJJs and they definitely are the kind of people who would lie their asses off if it meant hurting white people and making money, and they are also highly prone to paranoia and think everyone is out to get them.  Knowing this and this alone is why I have never bought into their versions of events. And for centuries they were whining about if they only had land of their own they would move to it and let the white man be.  Well, it‚Äôs sitting right there for them and they still don‚Äôt go.  Another big fat fucking lie.

                    I tend to agree. If our masters are judeo-puritan, we have to ask why they‚Äôre doing this. What‚Äôs the psychology of it?Take the puritan side of it. If they‚Äôre motivated by hatred, that sounds like an echo of Reconstruction, yet the South wasn‚Äôt ethnically or culturally cleansed in the end, when it could‚Äôve been, and the radical Republicans were suppressed. I think puritans are more motivated by pain and discipline than anything else. Self denial purifies the soul, or something like that. Seems like they can be pretty severe about it, but not ultimately genocidal.So you have to ask where the hatred comes from, the ethnic cleansing hatred, and that doesn‚Äôt leave many options.

                        The failure of reconstruction to obliterate the badwhites did not fail for lack of earnest efforts r intent. They  wanted to instigate a race war and see the Southern Nation suffer the Haitian fate.  Their inability to organize and arm the blacks, entropy, and competing forces seeking economic gain from the South‚Äôs carcas, and military control seeking peace and order stymied most of their worst intentions.  But if the damnyankee sjw had the way, they have always had the will.

                    Do try to lay off Durendal, Ya‚Äôll. Yes, there is a subtext on Zman‚Äôs site to not call out the obvious elephant in the room. I understand it is there for a reason.It is however a tough row to hoe and not let slip the mask of outrage at the eponymous and virulent nature of the tribe in the dissolution of Our People.We are guilty of weakness but this past five years it seems that all but a handful of them have laid bare their intentions and at every level of government, business, and society have bared their fangs against us.I find myself noticing so much that I have to question if I‚Äôm not just seeing boogymanbergs at every turn. The Russia hearings, the myriad of woke business leaders, the outrageous judicial decisions, the political bigwigs, the antifa bosses‚Ä¶ it seems like a full court press and I keep blinking and looking around wondering why everyone else doesn‚Äôt see it.I don‚Äôt have the time or wherewithal to go into any of the facshisty websites y‚Äôall sometimes mention so I‚Äôm not coming from there.But seriously, a commenter on a rather innocuous website I was looking at mentioned that Chris Wallace was tribe intersectional. I thought b.s‚Ä¶. a turd yes but he‚Äôs at least a good scots descendant like myself. With a name like Wallace?! Yeah, about that‚Ä¶Anyway.  Go easy on Durendal. Yes, it‚Äôs better to engage your targets in a deliberate methodical manner. Smooth and steady gets the job done. It‚Äôs also human nature to see you are surrounded and just start spraying rounds down range as fast as you can. It happens.

The analogy of slow and steady is in reference to what many here are trying to do, find community and build someplace to gateway other whites into becoming self-aware‚Ä¶ without going full out Kattie bar the door on them off the bat. Zman has set a reasonable tone for that endeavor, and it is HIS site.

                    Concentration camp guards? How gauche. I‚Äôll settle for deportation officer. ‚ÄúRepatriation facilitator‚Äù if you‚Äôd rather.

Israel for the Israelites I always say. Or Palestine for the Palestinians, whichever. I guess who ever wins the tussle of the heretics gets to name it over there. As long as they aren‚Äôt here, and we can work out a visitation schedule for the holy sites with the victor‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt care less.

        ‚Äú‚Ä¶whites would rather be dead than rude.‚Äù
Racism is essentially being rude. But everyone thinks its worse than sodomy.
My dad, born in ‚Äò45, saw a meme in his facebook scroll that said white bread is a ‚Äúprivileged loaf‚Äù. He chuckled. I didnt‚Äô. He and my mom lived in a white dominated society. To him, thats the way it still is. He thinks we are being nice when we don‚Äôt advocate for ourselves, and fight for ourselves.
I think his attitude is the dominant one for whites

        Saw a YouTube commercial for a Hulu movie calledBad Hair.Plot involves young negro woman acquiring a weave to assist her career. The weave turns out to be cursed and, I guess, turns her into an angry Black woman with supernatural powers.you just would not have seen this kind of entertainment back in the old days.Also, I have not seen a commercial; print, video, audio or skywriting, that does not feature a negro in a long time. Is every Black person not working for the federal government employed in the advertising field?https://noithatdongthanh.vn/cong-ty-thi-cong-noi-that-uy-tin.html

        I recall a show/movie on UK television where one of William of Normandy‚Äôs key advisors was black. Given that the Normans were originally Viking settlers I can‚Äôt see how that was true.The idea that London in Victorian times was liberally sprinkled with black people (modern TV adaptations of Austen and Dickens, etc, have them aplenty in most shots) is curious because I wonder what happened to them all between then and now. When I was a teenager in the early ‚Äô60s living just outside London we had 750 kids in the school and only one was mixed race. Somehow the numerous blacks in the Home Counties area had melted away from Victorian times. How odd.Happily they are back now.

        In all fairness, there were many Black cowboys. I knew a man whose family settled OK in the land rush. He used to tell his kids (he was a science teacher) about growing up riding horses and managing his family‚Äôs ranch. They looked at him as though he had 2 heads.So, yeah, a Western story with Blacks in it would be both realistic and interesting.But, not MN, before the Somalis migrated.

        Remember when entertainment was about entertainment, and not a platform for partisan politics? Here‚Äôs a news item from 10/4:https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8802999/Megan-thee-Stallion-slams-Kentucky-AG-Daniel-Cameron-Breonna-Taylor-case-SNL.htmlI‚Äôm surprised the term ‚ÄúUncle Tom‚Äù doesn‚Äôt appear in the article. I think a case can be made that more serious charges should have been brought against the cop(s) in the Breonna killing. You may not agree, and that is fine. But the point here is that a Black government worker is hated by his own people, when he is (apparently) just trying to do his job.Like many, perhaps most here, I don‚Äôt think that Blacks want to, and probably couldn‚Äôt if they wanted to, live under White man‚Äôs laws. I don‚Äôt think there is any solution to such a problem unless we have separate countries, or at the least, rigid segregation a la Apartheid or Jim Crow.
