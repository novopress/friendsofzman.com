        1992 sure felt like an inflection point for me. I can still remember the disbelief I felt watching the Clintons and Gores dancing to Fleetwood Mac like high school kids. I was only 27 but even at that age it seemed sodéclassé and puerile to me. I grew up during the Cold War. Say what you will about George H.W. Bush as a CIA man and an Establishment man, but he was paternalistic and sober and a genuine military hero. The Clintons seemed like such trash by comparison.I remember Clinton sniggering at Ross Perot when he said NAFTA would create a “giant sucking sound” from all the jobs going to Mexico. Perot was right. I remember Buchanan’s “culture war” speech and the fight against queers and abortion.1992 was the beginning of the end for conservatism and for the America I grew up in.

            And what I hated (I was very young, but musically precocious) was the sully forever put on Fleetwood Mac when Bill and Hillary danced to “Don’t Stop.” I never liked that song anyways, but, to this day, if that song comes on, I have to turn it immediately, for I can still see them dancing to it, and, again, I was about 6.

                Saw Stevie Nicks talking about her abortion saving Fleetwood Mac.  As if a human sacrifice was worth the denouement of their career.

                    There have long been rumors–as it were–that she is a witch. If so, she certainly wouldn’t be the least bit troubled by killing her own kid.

                        She would tell you it was an act of female empowerment.  And she has openly bragged about being a witch, a self-identified enemy of God and life.  A large and growing sisterhood.

                    There are millions of women headed to the polls who would eagerly sacrifice all their unborn kids to get what Stevie has had. Perhaps in some cases, some of their already born ones also.

                    Nicks’ new single is all about her abortion. IOW about me me me.  Like the others, she’s enraged that she got old, and she can hardly wait to eradicate the new life trying to emerge.  Is this not open evil?
We imagine ourselves advanced and civilized, but Moloch in Saturn’s mask still stalks your children in broad daylight.  Snuffing babies is the First and Most Important ‘right’ of the American female, the core of Leftist political principles.

                        Interesting.  To the “true believer” an unborn child is not a “person” to be considered an individual with rights. In short an entity not granted “personhood” under civil or moral law. Why would one mourn a “non-person”—a meaningless clump of cells, much less name it?  The feminine mind seemsunfathomable.

            The salient point with 22 year old me was that, ostensibly, these people looked at the 80s and thought it was bad. I couldn’t comprehend. I didn’t, and still don’t recognize that they were dissatisfied with the prevailing state of affairs. More like power hungry people who were celebrating because they had finally seized the power.

                The 80s were very bad for a lot of Americans.  The steel industry collapsed.  The auto industry wasn’t doing well.  The electronics industry collapsed over the course of the 70s and 80s.While there was some booming industry in the US in the 80s, the 80s was largely the beginning of the total collapse of US industry.  I was a kid/teen in the 80s, so for me it was all good times.  But I knew of a lot of people (parents of friends) whose company closed in that era and they lost their jobs after 20 years working for the company.

                    The whole texture of the US economy changed. From high-value added manufacturing, with relatively well-paid jobs and job security, to low-valued (or no-valued) added service sector jobs, with poor pay and no security. But the clouds had begun to gather by the late ’60s, with the resurgence of Japan and Europe. And because of the Cold War the US elite felt compelled to allow this.

                    There were a lot of forces at work there. One of the largest is also one of the least recognized — Americans were tired of pollution, and wanted their blue skies back. They wanted their kids to be able to swim in streams and ponds. No more reek of factory stacks and automobile tailpipes. Or smog burning their eyes. The ’70s, particularly Nixon, was huge on the environment, and, whether or not you agreed with the policy, America today is vastly cleaner.
But that’s what pushed the drive to off-shore. Not the wage differential.

                        If not for Reagan’s love of “free trade” this wouldn’t have happened.  When you have all these regulations driving up the cost of manufacturing, you cannot also embrace free trade.
Free trade was already killing America when Reagan took office, but he really institutionalized and popularized it.  Free trade is suicide.

                            Nah. Free trade didn’t kill China or Indonesia or Mexico or Malaysia or Bangladesh or Indonesia. Those who took developmental loans later had to obey World Bank or IMF rules and cave on environmental regs, so had to drop out of the competitive market for off-shoring.
There’s a reason China and India are among the last ones standing. And it’s not free trade.

                                Not only do these countries have protectionism and not free trade, they have currencies, regulations and costs of living that give them a distinct advantage over first world countries.
Furthermore, it’s not even trade.  It’s “American” companies that are doing the manufacturing in the foreign lands.  It’s not Ching-chong’s appliance company selling their cheap crap here, it’s “American” companies importing their foreign made stuff with an American name brand slapped on the front of it.

                        You’re right about pollution abatement but I’m surpised you  don’t think it was about wages. The wage scale in most foreign lands was (and remains) a small fraction of what workers must be paid in the US — if, that is, anyone is hiring.

                            Give a guy a $2 an hour raise. $80 a week. $4K a year. Big flippin’ deal. Do you have the faintest idea how much gets sucked out by regulatory and insurance?
A low-volume solvent scrubber can easily run over a half mil plus install. Capital cost alone of 125 man-years of a $2 an hour raise. Interest cost of twice that. And we haven’t paid the operating expenses yet.
That’s where you save. By manufacturing smewhere that doesn’t require the scrubber.

                                This is exactly why we cannot have “free trade” with countries like China.  We simply cannot compete with a country where the rules are not enforced and where pollution can just be dumped into the environment.
However, wages play a role too.  But it’s not just wages.  It’s all the safety regulations. It’s our horrible EOE laws (the insurance and the payouts).  It’s lawsuits when a worker looses their arm or something.

If someone else wants to live in squalor, or “live” on high carb and sugar and booze, or crank the music to 11, well, if he is my neighbor, maybe I should have something to say about it. If he’s halfway around the world?

                        Wages had a LOT to do with it. Don’t kid yourself. The wealthiest top 20% in this country are all invested in companies that outsource labor for a fraction of the cost of American wages. The profits — and the stock bubble — are stupendous:“GM builds the highly profitable Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light-duty full-size pickups at Silao. In the current plant contract, it said the wages range from about… $8.97 to $33.05per day.In contrast, GM builds… its heavy-duty pickups at Flint Assembly and Oshawa. At those plants, wages range from $18 to $32 an hour.”New union at GM Mexico plant could boost autoworker wages

            I voted for Perot because Bush was such a backstabbing weasel.  Old Ross was right about a lot of things.  The day of reckoning for the deficit seems to be approaching.

                    Perhaps, but the breakdown of popular vote is as follows:
“•	Bill Clinton (Democrat): 43.0%•	George H. W. Bush (Republican, incumbent): 37.5%•	Ross Perot (Independent): 18.9%•	Other candidates: approximately 0.6% “
One would need to look at the State totals and assume that Perot votes go to Bush in some large percentage, but 19% rake off from Perot is not to be ignored.

                        Sure, but all Bush needed to do to get the Perot vote was turn on his fellow elites and embrace what the voters were saying they wanted. Like a representative government is supposed to do. At least so long as what the people want is Constitutional.
Own goal in my book.

            The baseline, terminally online Trump assumption is:
“They’re going to cheat, so we have to vote big-ly”.  Presumably by adding extra votes as necessary.
No. If it’s necessary, they’ll just subtract from the Trump column.
Who’s going to stop them?
No matter what you think about 2020, it conclusively proved that US Presidential elections are non-auditable.

                Subtracting from Trump is not as easy as adding for Harris. You’d need to know the particular ballot for Trump and remove it. For Harris, you just drop in some phony mail-in ballots printed as you need it. Oddly enough, that assumes fairly accurate and true machine counting, which seems to be the norm. It’s those mail-ins that we overlooked while looking down the rabbit hole of machine tabulation.Note here in AZ, we actually randomly hand count/audit ballots after machine count. The percentages have to come in close to the machine tabulated counts before certification of results. But of course, there is no way of discerning between phony ballots and real ones.There was a proposal passed and vetoed by the new Dem Gov to produce ballots like bank notes—watermarked and serialized—such that they are hard to duplicate. The excuse was they would cost too much. Interesting that our Dem Governor is so interested in cost control.The Fed’s print dollar bills for $.075! If we did the same for a ballot, and even if the ballot cost $1 to produce, our total cost for ballots would be $3.4M—as that was the number voting in the 2020 election. Our current AZ State budget is $17.8B. The cost for such specially printed ballots would be .0213% of AZ’s current budget!

            A few years older at the time, but had the same reaction that we’ve put high school kids in charge of the country.  And Perot, for all the corn pone, was a steely eyed realist.  But he cannibalized enough votes to put Clinton over the top. Funniest thing, never heard a Democrat bitching about Clinton winning an overwhelming Electoral College victory with only about 42% of the popular vote.  By their reckoning now there should have been a run off election.

                Yep.  Another odd fact wrt Perot.  He claimed he would run a first class race on his own dime (being a billionaire or close to it).  He pledged $40M.  The last I heard is that the Harris campaign would spend $1.2B for her election! WTF?

        The weirdos invited millions of third worlders in assuming they would be their foot soldiers. But they aren’t the cannon fodder they had hoped for. Latinos are just Latinos. Blacks can’t put a plan together. Asians stick to themselves and promote their self-interest but aren’t revolutionaries. Jews and Muslims don’t get along. Heck trannies and queers don’t get along.
Meanwhile, White Americans are the largest, most cohesive group in the country. Potentially we have the most power. We had no power as a vast majority. But as we get surrounded we get more powerful. That’s how social dynamics can work.

            You make a good point. The “Very Clever Boys” (Hat tip to Severian at his blog for that turn of phrase) thought bringing in these varied groups would push out the natives and leave them in charge for ever.Forgetting completely the idea of Balkanization. And that “Blood and Tribe” contribute to that. They are now learning that these foreigners bring their old hatreds to America, and in one case, bring their hatred of one subset of Very Clever Boys right to their doorstep.And that’s without ginning up new hatreds from running into groups of people they may not have met back in the Old Country.

                Also imagine the “Very Clever Boys” realization that due to the over the top destruction of America there no longer exists much capacity to defeat their enemies in the ME.
At the same time they are learning that the majority of the younger generation do not  give a large rodent’s posterior about their tiny country in the ME.

                I suppose many of the original Tribesmen who came here probably thought of those ancient empires that had multi-ethnic subjects and how most of them still had a dominant tribe that supplied elite staff for the imperial government. They fancied themselves in that role. What they didn’t take into account is that none of those ancient empires were open societies in any sense. American democracy may be a fraud but it really does allow just about anybody to claw their way into some part of the ruling class. It also allows just about anybody to live just about anywhere. These two factors together guarantee that the US is probably the world’s greatest ever “hate factory” with people of all social strata constantly forced into angry interactions with their tribal enemies. This is cultural terrorism of the worst kind.The best physical analogy for what this country is becoming is a giant vat into which anyone can pour literally any chemical as strikes their fancy. Anyone who thinks they can control or predict the results of this is fooling themselves. The explosions, fires, and toxic gasses are also inevitable.

                    Whites, like everyone else, evolved a culture to deal with the reality in which they lived. Most of those who won’t “hang together” aren’t lostper se, but only so long as we do not have the kind of society that their culture works in.
Exceptions, yes, but most other cultures simply are not compatible. White culture only works in a high-trust society, preferably for groups somewhat larger than tribes and less than nation-states. Duchies seem about right. Particularly with “free” cities.

                        What might be a positive trait in one milieu, might be a negative trait in another.A high out group preference is likely a good thing when trying to survive a harsh winter. More co-operation with other groups, more trust. Misfits simply get thrown out, and die. For 99% of our history, the only groups we dealt with much were nearby, similar people.The world has changed on a dime since the airplanes in particular. You can go from anywhere to anywhere in under 24 hours. Nothing like this has ever existed before.Suddenly, an out group preference is a disaster, swamped by foreign people with an in-group bias, who have no interest in co-operation. Suddenly we are just the sheep, giving money to deceitful foreigners who then laugh at us.Suddenly, “Bad white” traits actually become much more useful…

                    To repeat myself (endlessly, I know), one important and large segment of our people are “spiteful mutants”.  It’s hard to beat your DNA. They can’t change.  They might be suppressed, but they won’t change.
People–especially in this group–lose sight of that simple biological fact.  It seems most here are beneficiaries of superior genetic stock wrt mental processes. Look to the depth and breath of our commenters and their careers as evidence.

                        Ah yes, this gets back to what I was saying about how someone could look at 1980s AINO and feel that something was fundamentally wrong with it. Spiteful mutants. (Without digressing into how there were things wrong under the surface, the financialization, the growing damage from the CRA etc., most of that wasn’t apparent to the typical person at the time, to whom most things looked ok in those days.) And that’s certainly not what the spiteful mutants found unsatisfactory. I think at least half of them were just upset that pot was still illegal and thought Clinton would change that. Or that homos were dying of aids, and that was Reagan’s fault too.

                        It is a tough reality to face and seems disloyal, which even if not especially bright and accomplished people find distasteful, understandably so. Truth remains truth, though, and it has to be acknowledged. We live in a time of plenty but that is going away, and when it does, these things will sort. Mutants ultimately are a luxury.

                        Compsci: You have grasped that vital fact that so many still refuse to acknowledge.  People are what they are.  Most cannot change; few of those who can ever will.  England reduced its violence over centuries by culling and expelling those who would not/could not comply.  We have accumulated a lion’s share of the word’s least capable and most spiteful, and refuse to suppress or remove them.  AINO’s future is easily seen in its ‘youth’ – all dark (skin and character).

                            I’ll do a shout-out for Plomin’s “blueprint: how DNA makes us who we are.” I think it’s currently the most definitive take on behavioral genetics. When the signal is real, you can’t the stop the signal.I like your summary of it. “People are what they are.” Equalitarian is dead. I expect it won’t change much in the short term, but in the long term it will make it easier to make the case for involuntary repatriation.It recalls to me why I chose the Roman poet Horace for my posting name. He lived during the transition of Rome from Roman Republic to multi-ethnic empire, so was well-familiar with diversification.They change their skies, not their souls, those who cross the sea.

        My take is this. Trump now has a power faction behind him. It is a coalition of power factions. To one of them he openly shows deference and fealty by showing up to the houses of their saints and their holy monuments making symbolic gestures of worship that to me, look like submission. This faction is singularly focused on the expansion of its territory and power of a nation and its nation state. It just isn’t Our nation or Our nation state.The other major one is less public in their support though that has changed recently when one of them has showed his joy and vibes on stage. This faction is composed of people who loathe the nation state and some of whom, (who are also coincidentally alien weirdos), have stated that THE political battle of the 21st century is the defeat of nationalism. Yet they back the nationalist candidate.What is the common ground there? Probably, ‘okay you get your nation state but we get the contracts to develop the weapons systems you will need and use to keep your project going.’ Just a guess there.Then there is The Nation who started this whole thing when they finally realized they were in deep trouble. Their jobs and financial ecosystems were destroyed by coastal financial tics and leeches. They stirred to patriotic frenzy and told two crazy things in the same breath. One was, “This is a civilizational battle that is existential. You fight them over there so we don’t have to fight them here.” The other was, “Don’t you worry. We are mighty. Just go shopping and take the kids to Disneyworld and take lots of plane rides through our new airports where alien wierdos man the gates in zones where the rights your men are fighting for overseas are abolished.” They also looked around and saw the third world arriving and, having a healthy spirit, were listening to the overt messages and actions aimed directly at them because of their race.They saw the clips of Paul Krugman saying they were the problem and that, “in the end their power is going to go away”. They saw his demonic smirk after he said that.The Nation looked for a champion and Donald Trump responded. They are the odd man out of this coalition – the means to office but probably no seat at the table nor a thought given to them.Yet, this is by far the better option because if the power faction that puts the Harris/Walz minstrel marionette up as its stooge this thing is going to be demolished in the race toward 2030 in a way that should frighten you to your core. Now, as Z-Man says, we may still be headed there, but buying time to bolster and organize itself as a People, and having a chance at a seat at the table is a better option.The Nation, no matter the result of this election, has to look to itself. It has to build itself up as a people and a true set of interlocking communities that form a globally connected People. It has to decide if it wants to be a second class layabout in a Strip Mine of a Shopping Mall, or to live on with dignity and someday take back control of its destiny.The election is critical. What is more critical is this decision and the thousands of tiny decisions and actions that will support it should it be to choose a future. Cast your vote, but give all of the rest of your time and energy to Our Future.

        ZMan suggests that : Donald Trump is “a force of nature who has changed everything during his time in the arena”From where I sit, I would say almost the opposite: Trump has changed Nothing – at least nothing that really matters, nothing substantive – and not in a positive direction of objective achievement.DT failed/ did-not-seriously-try either to “drain the swamp” or “build a wall” during four years. Instead, in 2020 he implemented the world-historical disaster of the Covid lockdowns etc, and later that year the BLM-fuelled violence and social destruction. He endorsed and encouraged the not-vax campaign. And then, after generating more words, he caved and accepted a stolen election and betrayed his followers.Ignoring the storms of words generated around DT; I see nothing to suggest he was/is responsible for stopping, let alone reversing, the long-term of evil trends in the USA, the West or the World.Very few national leaders really make an objective difference for the better. Margaret Thatcher reversed decades of progressive economic decline in the UK. Putin has reversed the West-engineered and ongoing destruction of Russia. But Trump is Not one of these rare leaders.My best guess is that Trump will win the election for the simple reason that he is overwhelmingly supported by Israel (politicians and people) and its supporters – and that is (for the people with the most power in the US) the single major issue of this election.

            If he does manage to “win” this time, it’s because he’s curried (sorry Usha) enough favor with the oligarchy for them to allow him to. Of course, one could debate who came over to whom, since a schism among the oligarchs had to happen for this to come about.
Barring any surprises in the next 4 years, the greatest accomplishment of President Trump was stirring globohomo to accelerate into naked force in place of fraud.

This is the most important aspect of the sideshow. Close behind is the flight of the neocons back to the Democratic Party. In hindsight we will see both as leading indicators of the recognition that empire no longer was sustainable. Even those of us heavily blackpilled have to acknowledge that is a step in the right direction albeit one that has come far too late.

            i completely disagree.  Things that could not be said 8-10 years ago are now openly discussed, not least of which is election fraud is 100% a real thing.  I think we have a lot more race realists now.  Conservative Inc is basically dead, and the party that used to cream their shorts at the prospect of bombing rag heads in the M.E. is now firmly anti-war when it comes to nation building.  People who, at one time, were the voices and leaders of the party have been exiled – Cheney, Romney, Trump, even the Bushes know they’re not welcome and largely have the good grace of their father to STFU.The government itself now openly operates in defiance of the people.  That’s something Trump changed, and it is a great thing.  Because the first step to getting better is to force the liars to decloak and to stop believing the lies.  That is a BFD.  The FBI no longer operates as a legitimate police function.  “Republicans” in Congress vote willfully against their own voters, and everyone sees it now.Trump is the first man in the history of the country to inspire 90-mile-long parades, or, upon surviving a bullet to the head actually got up and yelled “Fight!”  That is world-changing because he just gave everyone both the inspiration and command to reject this illegitimate government and the GAE which everyone knows just tried to murder him.We had 4 years with no new wars, and the drawdown of two disastrous wars.  People got to see and feel the genuine physical pain of inflation.Win or lose, Trump changed this country because we’re voting next week to decide whether we’re going to fight and the other side is going to ballot-stuff to drive us into slavery.  No matter the result, the current status quo which has existed for 80 years (160 if you go back to Lincoln) is DEAD.  It is completely dead.Just because you didn’t see the changes you wanted to see doesn’t mean things are the same.  This is a never going back election.

                Just because you didn’t see the changes you wanted to see doesn’t mean things are the same. This is a never going back election.I see what you mean. As for me, the changes I wanted to see wasmoregroveling genuflection to the Israeli President from our courageous (and extremely obsequious) ‘representatives’.  At last, a Bipartisanship a peasant can believe in!I was looking formorewhite genocide through the aggressive promotion of miscegenation (Thanks Usha! Your cousin Rumpiswampy sez your hubby is just the tits! Big pals, what a coincidence!)I was looking formorefailure to defend our People, our History, and our Monuments. More erasure of our identity, more blackwashing in our movies,more stony silence that this is even going on, much less that it could be a problem to be resisted inanyway.I was hoping for more baby murders, more Girl Bosses, more White male suicides, I was hoping for more genital mutilation, more troons, more degeneracy and filth.I have this fuzzy memory of 95% of the world’s population hiding under their beds while the Minor Head Cold monster stalked the land seeking whom it might inconvenience. Think of it! Billions of people who either could not see, or were too cowardly to resist, that wearing masks not designed to protect against viral transmission was ludicrously stoopit, but submitted for 2+ years because Leather Daddy Government said so.Now these same people will experience a Trump epiphany, finally see they have no representation, and will take to the polls en masse in a totally legit election. Fight! Fight! Unless the TV Man says not too. Or, you know, if the Pop Tart du juor mocks you for not falling in line and doing as you’re told.Its all very historic, of course. I wait with bated breath: who will win this Titanic struggle!!??Trump, or the entrenched Shadow Cabinet who have been raping us spiritually, mentally, and financially since we liberated them after WW 2?Yes, one certainly can’t tell!Just know that if God smiles upon us with victory we can all look forward tomoreof the game changing policy of pardoning more rap n@@@@ers and Israeli spy masters on his way out the door.Oh, but the uncertainty is just killing me!  Who will win!??Who??

A grandfather will take is grandson to a closet deep in the back of his assigned living pod, out of sight of Alexa’s camera and listening device.  In an old sock stuffed in an old shoe he will gentle unroll that picture of Trump in Butler, PA.  “I’m going to tell you a story about a country called America where free men once lived.”

                    Inadvertently, his accidental election did something very positive–it forced the demons out of the shadows. To this day I’m puzzled as to why TPTB didn’t simply coopt him, given he likes his ego stroked, but fortunately they didn’t even try. Normie as a whole never will wake up nor does he want to do so, but the borderline cases did and continue to do so. Why people blow that off as unimportant is beyond me. No, there isn’t a political solution at this point, but numbers ultimately count, and some attitudes can change. I saw where Rudy Giuliani said yesterday that Haitians should have remained in the jungle. Less than a decade ago he would have been fine with the banishment of someone who said the same. Small beer, of course, but it is telling. Accidents have determined much if not most of history.

                        re: why they didn’t just co-opt him, only thing I can come up with is Ukraine. They had to have it, needed it, or thought they did, and he wasn’t on board. Which dovetails into them framing him as a Russian agent rather than a Chinese or Saudi one. Otherwise, there doesn’t appear to be any good reason for them not to use him for their own purposes.

There was no chance of them choosing a different path just like the fact that the path they chose would inexorably lead to assassination attempts.

                        Why people blow that off as unimportant is beyond me.It depends on how you define waking up.The Guv has abandoned all of its legitimate functions, i.e. maintaining the individual in his property and his life. What else is a government for? If any organization constituted to protect the lives and properties of the citizens grouped within it abdicated these duties, and even actively pursues policies and laws that lead to violent death and the stripping of private property, it has lost all legitimacy.All of it.We live in a country that aggressively imports foreign criminals to rob, rape, and murder us. Any resistance to this importation will result in the full might of the State running a Randy Weaver Waco Jamboree on your White ass.It is impossible to imagine a greater treason, as actually selling white Americans off to a foreign government as chattel slaves is only a question of degree.We have been stripped of all Liberty worth the name, and it is obvious we are slated for existential destruction. Against this backdrop, the Demagogue Carnival of the Trump/ Harris crew is a sick joke told at the expense of a People so brutalized they get emotionally invested in the outcome of the stage show run to further mock their dispossession.None of these political ticks ever address any of the real perils killing us. Its all this mealymouthed, Platitudinous (is that a word?) buncomb about the carefully engineered social symptoms of the real, underlying problems. Any candidate who intended to effect genuine change would talk non stop about White genocide and the ruthless stamping out of feminismas a bare minimum beginning.What are these people waking up to? I know exactly 2 other people IRL who understand that ‘wimminz rights’ is killing us, and who agree that women should not be allowed to vote. And both of these individuals talk about the programmed media brain rot (of both flavors) their co-workers espouse,dandling their illegitimate mulatto grandkids and talking about their admiration for female MMA fighters.Answering your rhetorical question for myself,I see no signs that anyone is waking up to anything except that the truly amoral tend to self identify as Leftists, but this has now become self evident in the same way 6 feet of snow on your windshield suggests you had precipitation over night.I want you and Hokkado to be correct. But the level of brainwash coupled with the failure to grasp what I consider to be therealproblems is not encouraging.

                            ‘Any candidate who intended to effect genuine change would talk non stop about White genocide and the ruthless stamping out of feminismas a bare minimum beginning.’Yep.  He’d say right up front that endless female ‘rights’ and empowerment is destroying the nation, and it must be eradicated.  That’d enrage 35 or 40 percent of the (happily) brainwashed . . . but so what?  Tough.They’re gonna be enraged anyway, no matter what you do.  That’s where their power and influence is sourced . . . being Permanently Offended and Enraged.End the pogrom against men and little boys, and end the pogrom against whiteness, i.e., demolish A.A., Identity Politics, DEI and the rest of the globo-banksters and occultists agenda.A leader not beginning with those two things is not a serious person, nor really interested in saving and reforming the country.

                            Thoughtful as usual. “Waking up” in in this case is awareness. It goes beyond the Left’s insanity to the realization of the danger. That awareness is much more widespread even if it remains a relative blip.

                The government itself now openly operates in defiance of the people.
It can and will continue to do so until bellies are empty and houses are cold, but the clarity is indeed welcome. Throwing the border wide open was the breach that marked the transition to a domestic cold war that will be at best an uneasy co-existence.

Government will indeed continue to oppress, sure. Hunger and cold only spawn left-wing uprisings, though. You can look it up.
The kind of change we need is more like 1773-1787.Not from destitution, but from principle. Christians and men willing to act as if Christian values were worth preserving, saying, “No more.” Put aside rebellion to God, and as Moses and Samuel advised, swear allegiance to Him. If you detest God, and must have a king, at least have a king of your own people.

                    The easy part is Trump winning next week.  The hard part is what comes next.
Vance let the cat out of the bag on the Rogan show.  They were talking about the laptop and how nobody was punished for that.  Vance basically said it’s coming and a bunch of people will lose their clearances.  That’s like removing Dracula’s fangs.  And it’s an indication that a reckoning is coming.
People who understand how DC works understand that security clearances are a lethal weapon against the administrative state against which there is no defense.

                    Yes yes yes!!I too have been saying this for quite a few years: only when bellies and pantries are truly empty (and houses are cold) AND the wahmenz are nagging the men, that the kids have no food, AND  gas prices get you only 2 miles’ worth of travel, will there be kineticism.But not before.Normie Griller is still too comfortable and thinks Muh MAGA Orange Man will fix it all back to the way it used to be.I think we still have a few years before that comes to pass.Although my inner-blackpiller wants Cameltoe to win, to accelerate the decline and Jsut get the party started already, so we can get it over with, already.

                    It can and will continue to do so until bellies are empty and houses are cold
You must be well above the Mason-Dixon line.  When the houses arehot, that is when real SHTF.

            “..did-not-seriously-try either to “drain the swamp” or “build a wall” during four years.”Here we go again. This statement is demonstrable untrue. The “wall” came off to a slow start due to Dem resistance, but Trump finally played “hardball” and declared a “national emergency” and simply redirected the monies from other budgets (I think military).The first aspect of the wall was to repair and rebuild the old 500 mile stretch of wall, then begin to *add* the new wall. The new wall was going up fast in Trump’s last year and expanding at 10 miles per week. Had Trump been reelected, the wall would have been finished easily. Biden immediately stopped all construction and sold the onsite materials for scrap at pennies on the dollar.Also note, Trump reduced the immediate need for the wall by arm twisting and threatening South American countries into holding “refugees” within *their* borders. He skillfully used the Covid scamdemic to prevent any legal entry of refugees through Executive Order. The numbers of IA’s crossing was the lowest numbers in more than a decade by the time Trump left office.

            Yeah, I have to agree with bgc (Big Gay Charlie? – just a jest!), here. I believe Z may respond regarding Trump serving as a catalyst, almost like an electrolysis current, that clarified who stands with whom. He did not change the system in the sense of change per se, but he did help clarify and align (demarcate, if you will) the true beliefs of the true believers already in the system. Kicking over a rock doesn’t change the ecosystem of the troglodyte, but it does let us see the system more clearly. I think electrolysis is still the better simile.

        The difference now and 2020 is elite support (some, not all) for Trump. This in my view a direct consequence of the Ukraine War which has exposed the defense / industrial weakness of the US, and the West in general, and secondarily the Green Folly which if allowed to continue will kill AI in the West in its crib. And of course thirdly the auto industry which is at its knees and faces annihilation by cheap Chinese electric vehicles. Already Europe has surrendered on that front with tariffs gone, and the European automakers soon to follow: Volkswagen laying off tens of thousands and shuttering at least factories for the first time ever.Therefore powerful interests, not Hollywood, the Media, or even Wall Street, but defense contractors, the AI Silicon Valley dudes, and the auto industry support Trump as not-Obama. [Since Obama is really running policy in his lazy fashion].IF Harris is allowed to cheat her way to victory (or really Obama), Musk will go to jail. Bezos will lose most of his wealth and Amazon will be broken up. The auto industry will go away, and full on open borders will make defense spending go to zero as every penny goes to “immigrants!” Their will be no AI as the miracle worker, as there will be no power particularly nuclear power under “Green” fantasies. With Musk in jail, Space X will be fully DEIversified, with launches moving to every other decade and blowing up on the launchpad. China and Russia will own space.I will offer this: Musk does not look like a man about to go to prison for the rest of his life (btw, any who thinks he “just bought” Twitter ought to think twice — that was put up by his Defense backers eager to stem open borders eroding their spending pool). Neither does Theil, neither does Bezos look like he is ready for the poor house.Elites backing Harris face no real downside if she loses. They will not grift in full on DEIversity and Green Folly, but they will only lose part (not even all) of their grift. Musk, Bezos now, Theil, the SV dudes (who will see their firms and capital taken from them by the grifters) have everything to lose.Which means courts, and Defense elites will treat the cheat in 2024 different than in 2020. Its the end of the end of History. China and Russia and Iran and North Korea are now firmly allied, with China being the world’s manufacturer and Russia its oil and food supplier. Never underestimate Joe’s ability to F— things up.

                What is depressing about it? We have, real, real problems. Some elites share the pain of those problems or know they will shortly. They want to solve those problems. Some face immediate jail time because of those problems if Trump loses.Thus, Musk, Bezos (the world’s richest and second richest man) are on the Trump Train. As is AI driven big tech, the defense sector, much of the Pentagon below senior generals, and (not mentioned) but worth noting, all those Captains, Majors, and Colonels “stuck” and not able to be promoted no matter what they do because they have the wrong skin color, gender, orientation, and so on.It is the end of the end of history. Musk does not look like a guy facing jail time and seizure of his companies. That is my leading indicator. What does he know that we don’t?

        It does feel like something has changed, like Trump is a last hoorah for white America before we move into the next era.
That next era is one where those alien weirdos might be weridos but they’re now the majority. It’s their country now. Normal whites either accept that or start trying to carve out something new for themselves.

        Fun show.  The mere idea that Trump is up (or down) 1-2% virtually anywhere is f-ing laughable.  The guy is an indefatigable campaigner and barnstormer, attracting thousands everywhere he goes.  Meanwhile, Harris – walz struggle to fill high school gyms without the help of black or libshit entertainers.  Bottom line – no one will believe a Harris win, including the libshits…

        This is, at the minimum, a very important election, but also the last election for a uniquely American figure.Trump is a unique historical figure for sure:Won 3 elections back to backPresident twice non consecutive 45 and 47 (&lt;- possible)Survived a clear assassination attempt (and others thwarted before getting to the end)Add this to his personal storyBut most importantly as many others have pointed out he destroyed the manufactured consensus created in the XX century. As many others I went from a Daily Show daily viewer and daily NYT reader to be on this site.Another thing broken is the prestige of our secularized mental slop culture. I am not even religious but I respect a lot groups like the Mormons, Amish, Traditional Catholics and others that prioritize family and community and sexual mores as a protection against the destruction of our civilization. Atheism proved to be a logic bomb for civilization, our secularized priests want to trans the kids and make all the marriages open. And a rabbi owns the most famous porn website. The YouTuber blackpilled is very effective pulling the curtain when you are prepared. Entertainment will be spoiled forever if you are weak minded, but I am happy of being freed from the mental jail.This apparently is hard to appreciate for some black pillers who won’t even know about all this stuff if Trump had not broken traditional journalist’s brains. I used to fall for all the brain dead arguments about immigration (immigrants are better and commit less crimes than the average American, DANT YA KNOW?) and dieversity (OUR StRenGhT). Saint George Floyd would have been way more popular before Trump, now I don’t see even normies being too enthusiastic about any of the anti white propaganda on Facebook. Facebook around 2016 and now are totally different universes.Now we have a circus on X (formerly know as Twitter, hahaha, Elon is also part of the Avengers) where even dogmas I was raised upon are up to question (mustache man bad stuff that is used to blackmail us into perpetual wars in the middle East). Our skepticism about the boomertruth regime was propelled by all that Donald Trump enabled. I was not even a Trump supporter in 2016 and I was a subscriber to the TWW Weekly (a podcast about the West Wing show) LMAO. Now I think TWW is Sunday school for brainwashed liberals.Following the philosopher Scott Adams, Trump is the simulation having fun with an archetypical blockbuster story. Trump winning three elections is a technical impossible but totally possible due to fortification. Trump is about to pull a Grover Cleveland which is an impossible. Carter went into obscurity after being a one term president and only Trump was in a situation to try again, even his health is remarkable for his age.

        One point on Minnesota, Walz has driven a decent number of Republican voters out of the state. This was in part because of his draconian Covid policies but also caused by tax increases, particularly on retirees.  The state only had a 31k population increase from 2020 to 2023 and you can figure that without chain migration and refugee resettlement they would have had a population loss.  For those reasons I would expect Harris to hold Minnesota.Historically, I would rate Minnesota residents as having the strongest loyalty to their state out of any Midwest state.  It takes a lot to push them over the edge where they want to leave, but Walz managed to do it.  A significant number of them moved just over the border into Wisconsin so they still had close access to the Twin Cities metro area.  It would be hilarious if Walz refugees pushed Wisconsin into the Trump column.

        Looking forward to the show.What the Trump era has come to be about is who is going to run the country, Americans or a collection of alien weirdos?problem is the at even Reagan said that Americans are nobodies. Meaning, they have no past, they can come from “every corner of the world “. And this isn’t just some accidental thing that has happened cause of weather or employment. It’s how whites decided to define Americans, somewhere between ww2 and the early 80s white American men as a group said “whites are no longer exclusively Americans , anyone can metaphysically transform somehow into being an American because an American is a nobody.so there can be no aliens. All you have to do is, as Arnold says, “get your ass to mars” and you become somehow an American.i have to say, most dissents ignore this or dance around it. They won’t say what an American is, and until as a group, white men say , only whites can be Americans , I’m sorry, you’ve lost me.

            I worked for Pat Buchanan in 1992 and 1996. I was a young man at the time, and somewhat naive. I was mocked by my friends and one of them still brings it up, 32 years later, as evidence of my anti-somethingism.These guys are now in their 50s and vote Trump and adore minorities and Jews. Their conditioning in American public education in the 1970s and 1980s told them “anyone could be an American” — meaning,anyone can be like me. Me! Me! Everyone wants to be like me, watch football, make money, and be part of the greatest nation in world history.They’ve lived in all-white neighborhoods their entire lives, and until the past decade or so, worked in nearly all-white white-collar professions.It’s only in the past few years that I realized that the appeal of the post-WW2 conditioning you describe was not only an appeal to an idea, but to the egos of American men. Teaching them that everyone on earth aspired to be them softened them up to massive immigration, because they had been told that Indians, Mexicans, Asians just wanted to grill and chill and emulate the life they had by virtue of just being born here. And they have no clue of the consequences of their decisions for their children (where they have them) and grandchildrenOnly in ten years will they learn (if we make it to that point), looking around their chi-chi neighborhoods, schools, and hospitals and asking “what happened to all the white people?” They will then be in a foreign land with no way back.

                Additional thought: I’ve actually presented this argument to one of them. His response was predictable: “That what they said about Poles and Irish and Italians, dude. One generation later they were totally assimilated and now nobody knows the difference. You sound like a Nazi.”
They believe they have history on their side as well. It’s a potent, potent drug, and it’s a lifetime addiction.

                    Remind them that those Poles, Irish, and Italians were partly preassimilated—before arrival—through closely related ancestry, relatively similar physical appearance, and a common religion with a shared history of conversion. The Land of Opportunity gave them a degenerate common language to speak, a toxic Constitution to revere like holy scripture, and a vulgar culture to spread throughout the world by force of arms if necessary.Tell them that owners of the Land of Opportunity learned to demonize their shared ancestry once that ancestry became an impediment to the masters’ goals. So the LOO’s masters decided to enforce their status as replaceable opportunists, which Poles, Italians, and Irish had lacked in their homelands. Peoples who had been long lasting were turned into farts in the wind in the LOO.

Irish, yes. But Poles, Greeks, and Italians are still not totally “assimilated” — whatever that means.

                Oh Lord how I loathe that attitude – and I, too, see it everywhere.  When I traveled and lived overseas,I most definitely learned everyone was NOT just like me, nor wanted to be.  I learned that people and cultures are different and ought to remain separate and distinct.  I learned to appreciate the blessings I had growing up as a child in White America, and I learned those blessings were due to White, Christian men.  I’m past tired of hearing about the supposed ‘good’ blacks, Mexicans, Han, etc.  Their homelands reflect the inhabitants’ character.  Ultimately, genes and race may not be entirely determinative, but they are hugely predictive.

                    When I came of age as a native Southerner living abroad, when that regional identity was still very much a defining thing, I developed a boiling hatred of the Puritan that had not been developed at home. You couldn’t miss how freaking parochial are those types who fancy themselves cosmopolitan, how they viewed everything from the standpoint of a deluded enlightenment. They truly thought people from alien cultures strived to be like them, and were appalled when something indicated otherwise (something you still see to this very day with such transplants to the American South–shock to learn people secretly loathe them). Every bad trait exhibited way back then has been magnified, and the predictable damage from such narcissism has ensued. It is worse than just Magic Dirt. It is Magic Me, and they never will allow themselves to see how it is divorced from reality, and instead opt for burning down the house.

So true.  However, fish don’t know that they swim in water.  So it was with me.  Grew up in a White Christian environment–doesn’t everyone?  Then came the change, lots of non-White, non-Christians coming in.  The “welcome sign” put up for them, while the “Whites need not apply” put up for us.
What’s the saying, “You don’t know what you’ve got ’til it’s gone.”  And so it is…

                I was a Buchanan supporter also and when the party establishment turned on him it began my exit from the GOP/Conservative Inc. plantation. I stopped reading NR and Human Events and started reading alternative stuff and stopped voting for Republican presidential candidates (until Trump in 2016). I still think Trump was a disappointment who ran as a populist and governed as a Republican but these are desperate times. Normally, I think he would win comfortably but with the relaxation of voting security anything is possible.

            (W)hite American men as a group said “whites are no longer exclusively Americans , anyone can metaphysically transform somehow into being an American because an American is a nobody.I’ll counterargue that. I think when things began to change was when the “Press One for English” crowd started really pouring in from South of the Border. Prior to that an immigrant to the United States was expected to 1) Become a citizen 2) Learn to speak and write English 3) Get with the program and become an American.Oh sure, you could have your cooking and your customs IN YOUR HOME, but out in public it was expected you speak English (however poorly and heavily accented) and adopt American customs (and we can argue endlessly what those are). And if you had children, they would be pushed to learn English and become American.Now? Well the “melting pot” has returned to its original elements. Why learn English if you can live in an enclave of people who speak Spanish and everything is written bilingually for you? You can shop at supermercados and watch Spanish language TV and listen to Spanish language radio stations and isn’t it Muy Bueno ese?Now expand that to Indians, Chinese, etc. in the United States.The “fun” future generations of politicians are going to have is find something that unites these groups that hold tight to ethnic, racial, and religious lines. Sure for now hatred for Donald Trump and his supporters might work, but the Arabs in Michigan hate Democrats pandering to Israel enough they’ve thrown their vote to Trump.“Fun” times ahead.

                They are counting on forming an elite of the elites of these groups. What they see right now is that it works – for them. Silicon Valley and finance are hugely diverse! This is amazing!That works until it works against them too. It is already starting. I hear people, snivelling cowards who would never step outside of the accepted fashion of the GAE’s social order, openly talking about how South Asians have built whole nepotistic fiefdoms in the software industry.Then there is the issue that the people from India and China come from rising powers – empires. What happens when the pie here shrinks? Does this become a fighting ground for their squabbles?The whole thing when you think it through to the end and you rightly assume it won’t be the deck of the USS Enterprise is madness.

                It’s even worse. Non-English speakers have the legally enforceable right to have a translator in their native language for courts, public education, health care, and I don’t know what else. Not a big problem for Pedro in the Southwest, but what about the “asylum seeker”/illegal who hails from one of the hundreds of obscure indigenous tribes with a language spoken by hundreds, maybe a few thousands?

        Trump is a modern day Gaius Graccus.
Wants to stop the infinite inflow of immigrants; wants to evict those who are here. Hates forever wars. And so on.
He’ll meet the same fate, and for the same reasons:
He’s a traitor to his class; worse, he has pretensions of improving the living conditions of the great unwashed who are outside of that system and always will be.
(Hope he wins though.  BFYTW)

            The difference between Rome and now is that more and more elites are being hurt by Open Borders. Defense spending is incompatible with open borders which requires all spending be welfare spending. So Raytheon, Lockheed, Martin-Marietta, etc. are all against open borders as its spells their budget doom.The Defense Dept now understands it needs a draft. Good luck avoiding violent anti-draft riots, and Civil War with a draft coupled with Open Borders. The flip side of atomized White guys is that there is no social order capable of making them stop when they have no downside. Death on the Russian or Taiwan Fronts means no real downside for White dudes (draft will have to be White men only as they are the only ones with the IQ required in mass to operate on the modern battlefield). See the US Army War College Whitepaper on the projected casualties for the US in Ukraine (50K a month) and the need for the Draft.Even the smarter SV dudes understand that Open Borders means lots of non-Whites agitating to take their money, power, and status. They do indeed get it.

                50K casualties a month is projected in a U.S.-Russia conflict in Ukraine. Let that sink in. In other words, the United States would lose nearly the total killed during the course of the Vietnam War (58,281) every thirty days.

                    My apologies, the real number was every two weeks:“The Russia-Ukraine War is exposing significant vulnerabilities in the Army’s strategic personnel depth and ability to withstand and replace casualties.11 Army theater medical planners may anticipate a sustained rate of roughly 3,600 casualties per day, ranging from those killed in action to those wounded in action or suffering disease or other non-battle injuries.12 With a 25 percent predicted replacement rate, the personnel system will require 800 new personnel each day. For context, the United States sustained about 50,000 casualties in two decades of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. In large-scale combat operations, the United States could experience that same number of casualties in two weeks.13”https://press.armywarcollege.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3240&amp;context=parameters

                    The US will send ground pounders into Ukraine—and in those numbers? Doubtful. Even in WWII against equivalent hostile forces, we never incurred such risk. We won’t now. Heck, we couldn’t in a year dump such forces into the area of conflict. Gulf War I took Bush 6 months to orchestrate using the biggest *existing* peacetime army since WWII given to him by Reagan—and then only about 500k US troops.

        “No other country could produce a politician like Donald Trump. Even by American standards, he is a singular figure, a force of nature who has changed everything during his time in the arena.”The first sentence there expresses what is beyond doubt. “Only in America” applies to Trump more than almost anyone else. The last bit of the second sentence is nevertheless an overstatement. Trump has unquestionably changed the cosmetics and the rhetoric of American politics in ways that were unfathomable before he showed up at the party. However, it doesn’t appear that the U.S. Government is any different at all since his emergence. What has he championed or enacted policy-wise that would shake up the system in a meaningful way? Merely advocating for some border controls is hardly an extreme position. Another well-known phrase that appears perfectly applicable to Trump is “much ado about nothing.” Regardless of how he is portrayed or interpreted, Trump is just another bland centrist — like all the other American presidents during my lifetime (I was born in 1977).Looking forward to listening to the podcast!

            The only way for Trump to really change things is to implement a radical program to expel illegal aliens and those who acquired citizenship fraudulently (e.g., the vast numbers of “citizens” who can’t speak English). It will take some mighty big gonads and plenty of force (and maybe deadly force). I don’t think Trump is up to it (he couldn’t even get “the Dreamers” expelled during his term [because they were fine people]). He will get no support from the GOP or the federal bureaucracy. He might get military support if he fires the cuck flag officers now running the military and replace them with loyalists.

                “The only way for Trump to really change things is to implement a radical program to expel illegal aliens and those who acquired citizenship fraudulently…”Look, there are at least 15M IA’s (I consider “refugees” as IA’s) scattered about the country. You can’t find and deport them all without creating a political nightmare. Certainly one needs to start deportations under the rubric of ferreting out the “criminal” element, which would be fairly easy as most of these clowns get picked up for breaking laws to begin with locally.  You simply require that they be held for pick up by BP upon release and drive them to the nearest airport for deportation.What would be more effective now and in the future is to “spoil the milk”. It would be way easier to disallow any non-citizen welfare and employment.  This program enforced against American business that hires these people.  Simultaneously, expand the immigration judges to hear the asylum cases quickly such that if these “refugees” wish to work or receive welfare benefits, they must turn up for a hearing to be formally granted asylum.  No more “come back in 5 years” and they disappear forever.And of course move to eliminate “birthright citizenship”.

                    Yale University research in 2018 indicated that there were 22M illegal aliens, not the 11M that the govt said. The number dropped a bit before Biden, but if you include his 10M illegals/migrants/refugees, the actual number in 2024 is at least 30M. And of course there at least 20M legals that will never assimilate or speak our language. So in a country of 345M, 50M don’t belong.

            We’ve elected nothing but bland centrist presidents for all of our lifetimes.Something aboutthisbland centrist president caused years of riots, every cop from the top fed to the local lardass to turn against the non-criminal citizenry, more openly stolen elections than ever, the universalization of “public-private partnership” in political persecution, a false (in degree, at least) pandemic, and a military coup—in America.Trumpisspecial, though hedoesnearly nothing. He’s a great symbolic entity. He always has been. Interpretations of the symbol changewithout him. Only the posthumous mythic Hitler—the American version, where he’s not a politician or a man or even the devil but the monster from the white id—approaches Trump’s super-Satanic terror and awfulness. And maybe he doesn’t. Literal Hitler wasn’t arrayed against by all worldly powers until decades after his death.It doesn’t matter that Trump’s accomplished none of what he or his enemies have threatened.Nothing ever happensisn’t a doomer lament but a great insight. In the real world, we don’t live in the real world.

                The widespread unhinged animosity for Donald Trump is the most absurd American political phenomenon of my lifetime. Recall that leftists often foamed at the mouth with detestation of George W. Bush back in the day. However, W. gained the presidency through a heated legal controversy and divisive wars were fought under his puppetry (though it later turned out that much of the so-called anti-war crowd was much more anti-W. than genuinely opposed to foreign military debacles).  My point is that the leftists had some plausible excuses for despising W.The hostility toward Trump, on the other hand, appears to be entirely a reaction against his personality. Rarely do those who hate him pinpoint any policies enacted while he was in office as part of the “reasoning” behind their insanely negative emotions about the man. They almost never even bring up the overturning of Roe v. Wade, which is at least a substantive matter. No. They just hate the guy seemingly independent of anything meaningful that he does. I think many also hate the middle American white folks who tend to support Trump. It’s some combination of his brash personality and the demographic trends among his supporters that leads to all the psychotic fury against him.Though I don’t vote and I have no interest in backing Trump, I still consider much of the reaction disturbingly disproportionate to basic sense. I tend to believe that people deserve Trump to the degree that they hate him.

                    I think the general gravamen against Trump is that he’s allegedly a rayciss (based upon what, I’m not exactly sure). And, of course, he made that “grab ’em by the pussy” remark that’s got the dames eternally in a huff.
Of course, what the Leftists rate utterly damning flaws, we Traditionalists regard as salubrious boons. More evidence–if any were needed–that the two groups have no business living within the same nation-state.

                    I’ve long been of the opinion that if it wasn’t Trump, it would be somebody else on the receiving end of their rage for being denied the socialist utopia they believe is their birthright (which they aren’t capable of establishing for themselves anyway, they can’t even really define it, but I digress). This was also the root of their rage against Dubya. It’s nothing special about Trump, he just happened to be the one to come along and get in their way. TDS is the exact same thing as BDS, just with 8 more years to evolve and metastasize while The Precious held office. During which time they came to believe the evil deplorables had forever been vanquished and the utopia was at hand, so that their shock in 2016 was existential.Despite all their screeching about democracy, they are utterly incapable of participating in one, since this is how they act when they don’t get their way. Spoiled children.It took 4 years of “Biden” for thickheaded normie to finally even begin to comprehend that the “chaos” of Trump’s first term came not so much from Trump, but from the “left” pitching a temper tantrum over the loss of power to which it feels entitled. Many of them still don’t comprehend it. The “left” will never, can never comprehend it.

            Trump is all that the people think they have to counter DC/Woke totalitarianism.  They are passionate, even though Donald accomplished almost nothing lasting during his term.  Didn’t even get close to building a wall, which was his key campaign promise.
To me, he’s a real-estate salesman, and an Eighties liberal with a Prog daughter, from the 1 percent class.  Not exactly shaking-the-earth territory.

        Random thought here, I haven’t noticed any “dog whistle” claims lately about how this gesture or that body position is a signal supporting white supremacy. A little disappointed, it was fun when the media or 4chan would claim that things like the “ok” sign was some kind of call to action. Now that they’re bringing up Hitler 24/7 they could say that blinking or head scratching is an invocation of the Fourth Reich, not that hard to amuse me…

            The lack of right-wing “memes” this go-round, outside of Trump’s gift for being one himself, is because the right-wing internet has been destroyed. [Bleeps] are passing aroundcampaign photos. Elon lets Libs Of TikTok and the Babylon Bee direct our ire at white women and “illegals,” but 4chan is kill, MPC is deleted, Ricky’s in jail, etc. Not even Jared Taylor is allowed on Twitter.(He’s also not allowed in Poland. Survive The Jive isn’t allowed in America. Which of our guys was most recently barred from travel to England? [Jeopardy music.] That’s right! We don’t even add names to the list anymore.)Without the great anonymous labors of the schizo incels, we have no ideas—no self to express. The 2016-present cleansing of the tubes was avery neartotal success. You can be a vulgar civnat, depending who you work for, and you can say “nigger” if it makes you look stupid, but that’s about it.

                That stuff is still around. Just on Substack. After that is closed down it will be somewhere else.
The incels are still there. Still angry. You just won’t find them on 4Chan any more. Or Reddit. The downside for the Regime crushing a few examples and the purges on platforms is that the rawer stuff is out there and there is more appetite for the red meat so to speak than there was when Ricky Vaughan was on Twitter.

            “Easy buddy. Now, drop the Pocket Constitution and step away from the ledge.”Let’s say Trump does win. As far as I know, he can appoint whom he wishes to top cabinet positions. Or can he? The Senate must approve nearly all appointments including in the Executive. Perhaps we’ll get a slightly more Republican one. Couldn’t hurt.But even in the case of a Republican sweep of both houses (A man can dream can’t he???) we still have the remaining problem of the relative immunity of Civil Serpents. The President has very little power over the bureaucracy.Ah, but Congress does…. largely through the budget process. You know, that independent Congress that strictly interprets their voters’ wishes? The Congressman who would never be swayed by inducements, legal or otherwise, such as enormous campaign contributions by powerful donors, or perhaps an off-the-record visit from AIPAC or other power influencer?

        Western banking oligarchs need a major war in order to mask the upcoming default of sovereign debt bombs in the US and EU. They were hoping to avoid this contingency by raping Ukraine’s resources and kicking the can once again, but Russia is not going down and the clock is ticking. The election is a distraction from this reality. The BRICs are not taking the bait on war, which the West can’t fight anyway. As such, the US and EU will now enter their decade of real hardship. Plan accordingly.

        I think Trump is going to roll.  After that, who knows?If there is to be any hope of a soft landing, justice must be established and must be seen to be established.  Of this I am skeptical.There’s about 300 that need to be in jail and another 30 or so that need to swing.Maybe 3,000 that need to be stripped of citizenship, dispossessed, and deported.Against the hundreds of thousands of Appalachians who were deliberately poisoned the past thirty years and more, I say 3,333 is amercifullylow number.My sense is that whatever happens, a lot of women are going to want to jump on the Big Daddy Vance Train in 2028: Vance – Haley, Vance – Lake, Vance – MTG, Vance Coconut Mama, and so on.

        Since we are predicting a close election, it’s worth looking at all the data, even if some is obscure. In this case, there has been some interesting poll movements in Canada.There have only been a few polls of Canadians, but overall Kamala wins 60-21%. In 2020, the poll was 67-15%. Huge number of “don’t know” as well.The most notable finding, is that Canadian men under 34 are actually tied – 36% Trump, 36% support Biden. The Kamala support is entirely old people, and especially old women.What does this mean for the US though? I don’t know, but thought it was worth sharing if it helps you decode the election a little bit more.

        Assuming Trump gets in, I don’t envy him his job. He’ll be holding a weak hand internationally and the things he wants to do domestically take several years to implement, if not decades.
Meanwhile here’s a recently published piece inNew Left Review, just off the printing press, so to speak:

            What about the domestic front?
There’s no guarantee that Trump will get friendly majorities in the houses of Congress.
Even if he does, Speaker Johnson seems like exactly the sort of person that would undermine Trump the way Ryan did during the first two years of Trump’s first term.

                Trump will have a hard job both internationally and domestically, no question about it. Clearly he wants to accomplish something –he’s not some grifter like Biden or Harris or Clinton. I wish him well.

        Taking Zman’s advice – enjoy the ride this weekend. Early 2016 I was looking for work and decided to volunteer briefly for the Trump campaign. There was no infrastructure or ground game back then. Three guys – me, the office manager, and the state campaign manager and that was it.At that time Trump was considered a serious threat and a complete outsider to the GOP. Cruz and Rubio each had big offices, state party backed  support and dozens of paid canvassers by comparison.The last few weeks of the primary and we were concerned how things would go. The GOP leadership in Colorado announced they would cancel the preference vote and were going to appoint their delegates to support Cruz in the caucus. Our state was next in the primary and thankfully Trump came and hosted a big rally. Our days at the office were spent calling lists of anyone who emailed the Trump website. We would invite them to the HQ to pick up a yard sign and come to the rally. Thankfully I got a job shortly after this, but that brief experience was certainly an eye opener.I tend to agree with the Zman’s observations.A noticeable shift in regime media over the past few weeks.Acknowledging Trump’s strong position, hinting he could win and slowly normalizing discussions to some of the campaign’s talking points (albeit with the obligatory woke, anti-White objections).Should Trump end up winning it will be interesting to see if/how the left decides to bring back their domestic terrorists and shock troops. Killing country music fans in Vegas, the pussy hat marchers, Antifa/BLM rioters, illegal aliens violently beating and spitting on Trump supporters at his rallies, and yes, shooting at Trump himself. None of these things should be forgotten.

        ZMan —
This is the first podcast of yours that made me laugh out loud at least 4 times.The off-the-cuff humour is just excellent.To wit:
–I accept wampum!
–…That Aunt Jemima character in Georgia; what’s her name?
–Gannett is owned by Greenberg, Schlossberg, and Stein.
Outstanding.
RE: so many stupid people voting: Indeed. I advocate for the repeal of the 19th Amendment. It would fix so many problems. Plus it would be fun to watch the Karens implode.

        Towards the end of the podcast, Z-man makes the point that the Establishment might actually prefer a Trump victory because it would clear the way for prominent Democratic governors such as Gretchen Whitmer, Josh Shapiro, and Gavin Newsome to run for president in 2028.  Another factor might be the fact that the time between 2025 until 2029 is going to be difficult.  The Russians are clearly winning in Ukraine and could be on the Polish border within a couple of years, absent a satisfactory political resolution.  The Middle East could involve the US in an unwinnable war against Iran and facing opposition from heretofore friendly Arab governments, while trying to restrain an Israel that is taking its foreign policy from the books of Deutoronmy and Joshua.  And the Pentagon seems to want a war with China by 2027.  Add to all of these problems a national debt that is at a level impossible for humans to comprehend and the Global South looking at BRICS as an alternative to the west and the dollar.  Why not let all that happen on Trump’s watch?  His first administration didn’t show a big willingness to take on the Deep State, which is even more firmy entrenched today than in 2017.  But, like Z-man, I give Trump credit for at least drivng the right people crazy.

            The Pentagon mostly DOES NOT want a War with China any decade soon. THAT is the Eye of Soros, who made a speech last Spring demanding Regime Change in China that in turn provoked a lot of crackdowns on not just US NGOs but US business as well and lots and lots of dumping.The fundamental problem is now not just the Russians but the Chinese have hypersonic cruise missiles with ranges of thousands of miles or more. Invisible to radar (because of the plasma it generates through extreme high speed friction in the atmosphere, absorbing all radio waves thus no signal return). Able to sink cheaply our carriers. Which have a maximum range of the F35 fighter of about 700 miles plus. They can sink our carriers before the carriers planes are in range of the missiles. See: Houthi and the Blowfish shutting down the Suez Canal.The solution is basically a whole new Navy. With drones, lots of unmanned assets, missiles and rail guns and directed energy weapons and lasers and probably rods from God. All of which requires Republicans — the bargain is the Pentagon and its suppliers keep Republicans in power, they in turn direct most spending to the military for the new Navy and Space Force. [With a big heaping helping of AI to find new materials, etc requiring massive expansion in likely nuclear power for those AI data centers].In order to do this, LOTS of “migrants” will have to be deported, and no new ones taken in. Ukraine exposed the uselessness of the US boutique military model and how we need to shape up before shipping out by essentially totally rebuilding our military. A build up would require at least 15 years and more likely twenty. Of course, lots and lots of Pentagon people and defense contractors will make even more bucks. But Paris is worth a Mass.Note even in Wartime it takes a lot to build ships and we now have only two yes only two shipyards capable of building capital ships (subs, carriers, and destroyers). So any naval action would have to wait years before we could even think of fighting China.

        If you’re going to offer a sweatshirt advocating beating libertarians, you ought to accessorize it with a baseball bat with the words, “Your Rights” stenciled on it. When an annoying libertarian starts demanding his rights, as they are known to do, you can haul off and give ’em to him, good and hard.

        Oh no, the thinking house wife isn’t voting!By voting for neither of these selected-and-bought candidates who have zero accountability and are both moral degenerates in a system that is now fundamentally unlawful and evil, I will survive this election season with my integrity intact. Victory will be mine in a world of disappointed losers who have taken the bait and bought into the scam. It is only a matter of time before they realize all they have lost.This country’s biggest problems are moral. Every person who refuses to sell his soul to the scam of mass democracy is a stone in the foundation of a better building. I want to be one of those stones. I want our descendants to live in that building, imperfect though it will be.She brat! But seriously , her style is a bit shrill for my tastes but the geurange quote is a good one:So long as those rulers comply with the compact, or do not turn to the ruin of their people the power they received for its well-being, so long their right to the obedience of their subjects is the right of God Himself, whether they exercise their authority in exacting the subsidies needed for government; or in passing laws, which, for the general good of the people, restrain the liberty otherwise theirs by natural right; or again by bidding their soldiers defend their country at the risk of life.….When God is not with Him who governs, the power he exercises is nothing better than brute force. The sovereign, or the parliament, that pretends to govern a country in opposition to the laws of God, has no right to aught but revolt and contempt from every upright man; to give the sacred name of law to tyrannical enactments of that kind is a profanation unworthy, not only of a Christian, but of every man who is not a slave.

        Donald Trump, a man who does not read and speaks a video vernacular, is a great people person. He thinks he’s superior but he still likes his lessers. The man who goes to Trump Tower to fix his plumbing has more in common with the Queens boy than all the socialites of Manhattan. Brash, bold and hair-beautiful, the Donald reminds one of a romance novel cover gone rogue and aged. Thanks to reality TV, we got to see Donald in his element weekly, and it was fascinating. He’s a creature of the video Internet, of YouTube rather than Salon. But most of all, Donald Trump is a golfer, swinging for a hole-in-one with our lives. If Trump wins, we get to avoid a neocon-inspired World War 3 and return to grilling in the backyard while Dennis Leary’s “Asshole” plays scratchily in the radio. Four more years of MAGA and we can start a business catering to single women crossing state lines for an abortion. Donald Trump’s win would be as welcome as a blowjob on a lazy Sunday morning with the missus feeling frisky. And by the way, use your alpha abilities to get Miss Head to vote for Trump too. If Donald Trump can fork over $100,000 just for sex with a porn star, he deserves a vote just for his locker-roim shenanigans alone …— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)
