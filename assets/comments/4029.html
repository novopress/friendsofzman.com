        I think the question is: does the world really need another nuclear power? Is it wise to “allow” another Moslem nation to have its finger on the nuclear trigger? Deterrence only goes so far. At some point, the less sane nations start to think its a good strategy to go for broke. I’d rather not be on the receiving end of Iran’s apocalyptic quest for Moslem hegemony.

        The USSR, N.Korea and even Pakistan is / has been ruled by folks whose primary goal is maintaining their power and authority and staying ALIVE to be able to exercise or expand that power and influence.They were NOT suicidal.The Iranian mullahs are suicidal in that one of their desired goals is to die and go to heaven and have sex with many virgins. To these mullahs and other Iranian fanatics, death is a very attractive option indeed.It is this reason and this reason only  that Iran having nukes WILL cause a holocaust; the Iranian fanatics are LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS OUTCOME !!Historically, the Japanese of WWII most resemble today’s Iran in regards to their willingness to die and MORE importantly, to sacrifice their citizens to achieve their goals. It is this reason that it took the fire bombing of Tokyo (100,000 dead CIVILIANS ) , and two atomic bombs before  only SOME within the Japanese leadership, decided it was better to surrender than cause the total annihilation of the Japanese people.The Iranian mullahs are more extreme in that they would have no problem sacrificing every single Iranian (any why not; they will all go to paradise upon their death ! ) .Kerry, Obama, etc., despite the lessons of history, make Neville Chamberlain look like a war-monger. They are so arrogant and incredibly stupid they actually believe that it is their own influence and personality that will sway the Iranians from seeking nukes, despite the fact that the Iranians have clearly stated that NOTHING will stop them from attaining nukes.At this juncture, the only hope, however slim, is very very harsh economic sanctions on Iran; the very sanctions that Obama – in his incredible stupidity, ignorance and arrogance – has alleviated.One can only believe that this former “community organizer” – aided by Kerry (a lying SOB who perjured himself before Congress in the 1970s) –  actually wishes to INCREASE the instability and chaos in that region. This goal is totally consistent with his neo-communist, hate-america-first ideology.Tyrants are always dangerous, but the suicidal tyrants are far, far more dangerous.

        Obama would do nothing if the Iranians touched off a device in an American city. Nothing.

        Nuclear weapons have avoided wars, if wasn’t for nukes WWIII would had already happened, Iran should go nuclear as fast as possible if they want to keep their country from being invaded like Iraq.

        I have to agree, a nuclear Iran changes the entire dynamic in the area.  Iran clearly has caliphate on the mind and would probably countenance the use of a nuke to achieve military/political/religious gains.  I think they are the least stable of the lot.

        The Saudis take the American capitulation seriously, and are scrambling to go nuclear now also. Iran and Pakistan are of the 1/9th Shia minority. No way are the Shia going to be the only ones holding nukes.
