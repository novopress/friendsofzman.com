        Hindus are clannish and often annoying, but on the whole have merged quite well into Goodwhite ranks
No, this is a mistake. It is a fatal error to think that a foreign overclass adept at gaining access to the levers of power is “merging.” It’s not merging, it is conquering.

            I suspect that Derb wants to believe that indians have assimilated to the good whites because the alternative is too frightening. But even if he’s right, why would a traditional white want to strengthen the good whites?
indian assimilation is an instance of high IQ nationalism, which is the hope of many smart whites. It is one of those foolish ideas that you have to be very intelligent to believe, because high IQ non-whites are obviously tribal.
Smart whites may buy themselves some time with high IQ nationalism, as their less intelligent brothers are dispossessed, but most will not be spared.

        So maybe things aren’t all that different. If any listeners have more recent first-hand experience of the place, I’d be interested to hear it.
My daughter spent a summer and fall in Ketchikan, AK, working as a surgical tech at the local hospital. If the Greenland Eskimos are anything like the Alaskan ones, they’re still a nasty set of lazy, shiftless drunkards and incestuous pedophiles, which seems to track with what Kpomassie wrote.

        The idea that a negro, regardless of where it’s from, would be shocked by sexual promiscuity is, frankly, laughable.

        No one in Canada wants to join the Evil Empire. What would they get? An expensive, exploitative healthcare system. High rates of violent crime, due to a huge population of Negro parasites. A degenerate culture.
Only a crazy person would want any of that. It’s true that Canada has a woke-communist ruling class, but it’s even worse in the US. And Jewish money controls both countries equally.

        Donald’s talk about Canada and the Gulf of Mexico is just the usual yanking the crank of the press. He may be semi-serious about Greenland and the Canal. They are both of important strategic value.

        There´s an amusing TV interview with The Beatles in the early sixties being asked how they got to America. Well, answered John Lennon; we took left at Greenland…….
