        Just today the German Interior Minister revised the official estimate about the expected number of 2015 asylum seekers to 800,000. And can we be sure it’s going to be the last upward revision for this year?As an aside, being a German I don’t quite know how to cope with the fact that the quoted article apparently doesn’t contain any Nazi reference, not even a veiled one (“still haunted by the specters of its past, Germany … “). I feel like perhaps a disappointed masochist would who, despite seeing the whip in his master’s hand, then doesn’t receive the expected lashing. What happened? Do the old rules no longer apply, does water now flow uphill, have Muslims given up on slashing jugulars?But we won’t be able to enjoy the luxury of worrying about “image” much longer anyway, as the threat ever more builds up to the level of existential.

        Soon there will be no concept of countries. Such an old-fashioned idea! We have it in England now: the EU (to whom we must repeatedly doff our caps) sees us a ‘region’ and not a country. My own Yorkshire is a region in a country, but thanks to Brussels it will be a sub-region of a region.But, there is a good reason. The libtards hate war, or so they say, which means cleverly if you don’t have countries there can be no wars. Open the doors to millions of people who don’t have any allegiance to the host country then who will fight for honour and flag? Who will join the army or navy when you get more from doing nothing? There is no reason to ‘defend’ a patch of land if you don’t care where you are. Some immigrants may have zero knowledge of history or culture or traditions, so where they end up is only a matter of who gives them money and guarantees their benefits. No point in defending or cherishing what is essentially a temporary home, so no-one will go to war when you cannot maintain a military.War won’t end, of course, as the terrorists and shits of the world know, but as it can’t be declared as a war (you know, with real goals and measures of victory) then there is ‘peace’ wherever we go. true, it is a peace that may mean people are randomly blown up by some lunatic worshipping some fuzzy ‘holy cause’ based on vengeance, but it isn’t a war. Libtard politicians can tell themselves we have finally got what we all crave: thanks to open borders we all can enjoy a world without conflict.We may have death and humiliation and fear and the poverty that low-expectations bring, but not war.

        …I would add that the ‘open borders’ religion depends onan unshakable faith in the ‘blank slate-ism’.They believe that we are all them same.That everyone is a fungible human Lego block.Whether filled with Somalis or Swedes, Minnesota will be just the sameprosperous, industrious place it has always been.They’re never going to read Nicholas Wade, or Jason Richwine.That Wade was Science Editor of the NY Times for over twenty yearscounted for nothing – He committed heresy and he’s joined the disappeared.These people will certainly never read Derbyshire,Sailer,or the impenetrable Razib Khan.If you dissent you will be disappeared.Remarkably, Trump has trumped the Republican establishment by giving Americans a choice about endless immigration.Now conservative Americans have at least one man willing to defend Americaas a country with actual borders.More remarkably, Trump has doubled down on his anti- immigration program.Any other Republican would have been already walked-it-back,groveling to La Raza, the whole way.Now, who do we get to replace Boehner, McConnell,Grahmnesty, McCain and the rest of the cheese eating surrender monkeys?Remember the iconic Variety headline from “Yankee Doodle Dandy”:“Stix Nix Mix Pix”.How about:“Trump Stumps – Dumps Chumps”…

        I was reading Der Spiegel yesterday. A German paper with notably leftist bend. They were bemoaning callousness of the Greeks who refused to offer any help to a wave of refugees from ME. Fifty thousand refugees land in Greece EVERY month. Couple of years and Greeks will become a minority in their own country but that didn’t dawn upon Der Spiegel’s writers.
