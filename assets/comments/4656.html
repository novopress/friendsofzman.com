        Yeah, I work for a local ISP. I used to work for Charter, but got out two weeks before they moved the call center. First it goes off to Rochester NY, then off to another country. And we were assured that none of it would happen. I hear lots of horror stories about off shore tech support but it never seems to factor into purchasing decisions.My favorite is about Dell tech support. Guy called in with an issue. Spent almost 8 hours on it with tech support in India. Then the support guy said “My shift is over” and hung up on him. The guy called back in, happened to get support in the US and it was resolved in 15 minutes.

        The Weimar government opened concentration camps, suspended freedom of the press, and jailed dissidents. Some deserved, some didn’t. Sure as shooting’ though, if “conservatives” abolish tenure, ten years from now that abolition will provide justification and excuse for purging the remnants of opposition totalitarian Leftism.

        I once trained a woman in software whose job, at a company about to close down its UK operations, was to find a business in Sri Lanka or the Philippines (or any place that would do it all cheaper) and arrange for them to take over. Of course, all her friends and colleagues at the UK workplace lost their jobs. So too did she: the woman went into this task knowing she would be the last one out. She would turn out the lights and lock the door behind her. The company’s ‘managers’ had already gone and taken what profit they could with them as a pay-off.She also knew that the people who eventually got this business were likely to be corrupt, lethargic, and when they did get the work done they were hampered by a customs and excise arrangement that left goods at the dockside for weeks instead of delivering to customers.I know the company in question, and while it may well be doing okay I will not buy from them.

        Oh! It is oh so late.  Too late, too late.   Somewhere in my collection of links, I have a story posted about a upper level manager in (New Jersey?) that was describing his plan to off-shore the data processing of state records to India.   He was wildly enthusiastic about the cost savings in his department (which would then consist of him and his secretary) and then he told the publicly elected State Treasurer that this was no more than the inevitable advance of progress.  That farm work was replaced by factory work and factory work was replaced by office work.  That in an advanced society the workers progressed from physical labor to mental labor and the laid off data clerks and programmers would move on to become the labor force of the future.The State Treasurer leaned forward, looked at the manager and asked “What comes after mental labor for your people?”.My job, setting up and managing Call Centers at a bank, went to India five years ago.  Some time after the swap, the new Call Center manager in India called a friend of mine who still worked at the bank and asked him to explain American Slang to him.  He asked why, when the calls came in from America and were answered by the agent in India that the caller upon being answered by the Indian agent, the caller would say “AhShit!” and hang up.    “What’s AhShit!” the CC manager wanted to know?  Hundreds of people working in those Call Centers in America, lost a job within an industry that was doing the same all over the country.  They lost a career and an income that they would not see again.  The bosses in those American companies no longer cared if their customers were happy with the changes or about the lives of the people who built their businesses up in the first place.When my grandfather, an elevator operator, retired; he immediately bought a new Chevy, and went on a European cruise.  I wish as I contemplate my future in early, forced retirement, that I could afford to spend money like that.  He had a good pension and the money he had in the bank paid him enough in interest to provide for him and grandma.   My company matching stocks in my 401K went bust and there is no interest or appreciable yield on any of my savings.Yah, the game is fixed all right.  Revolution anyone?
