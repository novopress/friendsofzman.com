        If a cop shoots someone under the same circumstances, it’s probably declared a justified shooting after being investigated by his friends.Dearborn is not a toilet. It is 40% Arab-American and only 4% Black. If you can get past the whole Muslim thing, it’s generally middle class, clean and crime free for a city its size. If you’re ever in the area, I highly recommend Greenfield Village.

        What is especially revealing is the degree to which Frankfurt propaganda has invaded our minds– the minds of the jury. The Founders intended the jury to be the ultimate arbiter of law, both in opinion and in facts. So this is where we are.

        Involuntary manslaughter sounds right to me. 15 years in prison sounds about right, too, considering the alleged circumstances. Unless the drunken woman physically charged at the shooter after he opened his front door, there’s no way the shooting could be considered an “accident” or “self-defense” and excused with no jail time.
If you are going to own a gun, then you have to use it responsibly.  The vast majority of LEGAL gun owners in the country do act responsibly.

            15 years is a bit much. Assuming there’s no evidence the guy was hunting black women, this looks like something like vehicular homicide to me. 15 months is more in line with the facts. Give him five years and then let him loose in 18 months.

        The verdict seems excessive, but not unjust.  Shooting a drunk chick through a screen door is a bit much.  Here in Virginia, hardly a liberal enclave even now, you could never get away with that.“Wafer claimed during trial he never meant to kill McBride and he and didn’t know the shotgun was loaded.”That statement tells me everything I need to know.  Of course Wafer knew the gun was loaded, and of course he meant to kill.  I suspect he got an extra ten just for saying something so patently stupid.This story is instructive because of what is says between the lines, about the state of America today.  I don’t know much about Dearborn Heights.  Available census figures are from 2000 and 2010.  They show a mainly white suburb that has been losing population since 1970, and which has become increasingly populated by ethnic minorities.  A typical story in the once mighty rust belt.  I’m sure the minority population has only increased since then.  Nearby Dearborn is a toilet, and America’s Islam central.There is very little information about Theodore Wafer on the internet.  He is described as a 55 year-old “homeowner”, and that’s it.  My guess is he’s a middle class guy, a working class guy.  Maybe he or his family fled Detroit in the late 60’s.  Of course, Detroit eventually followed.  His neighborhood likely used to be a nice safe place, where you could raise your kids and leave the door unlocked.  It probably deteriorated as the Section 8 crowd moved in, same as Ferguson.  This ordinary guy, like so many ordinary guys and women across middle class America, probably spent the last several years living in terror.  I wonder if there had been a series of burglaries before the shooting.  No wonder Wafer went nuts when this hysterical drunk started bashing on his doors.That’s not how you do things in the old America.  You don’t get drunk, crash your car (and perhaps kill someone in the process), and then start pounding on a stranger’s door at 5 in the morning.  Perhaps that works in the ghetto, but not in places like the old Dearborn Heights.  You make a ruckus in the middle of the night and its just assumed you are up to no good.Wafer seems genuinely penitent. He’s probably a decent guy.  He should have been more prudent, but he snapped.  I think he should have been put away, but not for so long.  He didn’t help himself with that absurd defense.We are going to see more of this, not less, unless the overclass succeeds in taking all the guns away.

            A few thoughts on the case.1) I think if you’re drunk and banging on a strange door at any time of day, you are a threat.2) The owner had choices other than opening the door and shooting the woman. He could have called 911 and retreated to a part of the house where he could defend himself.3) People panic, especially when they get older, when confronted by out of control young people. This man lives on earth and he certainly knows the reality of life in our times. I’m sure he was dazed, confused and scared.Putting it all together it looks like involuntary manslaughter.
