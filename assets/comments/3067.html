        NY is so behind the times! Here in the PRK* we don’t need no stinking doctors to declare you a mental case. Any old cop or family member and sympathetic judge can get your 2A rights and your property confiscated. Only takes one hearing, you don’t even get invited it’s so convenient. No medical or psych exam required!

        Anyone who does not have a gun in N.Y. is “mentally unstable.”

        In the former Soviet Union, political dissidents were often declared mentally ill and then incarcerated in mental hospitals.  In the new Soviet New York, government Apparatchiks misuse psychiatry to take people’s Constitutional rights away.  Not a smidgen of difference.  A NY Democrat, an old line Soviet, they’re all the same.

        The anti-gun crowd knows that they will fail on any direct assault on the 2nd Amendment, so conniving bastards that they are, they will attempt back door strategies, such as the “mentally unstable” campaign. So if you live in New York and own guns, would you really pay a visit to a mental health professional? And whatever happened to privacy of medical records and patient/doctor confidentiality? Oh, that’s right, not when Leftists are in charge.
