        You’re a braver man than I, Zman. Writings by the Gatekeepers are an exhausting tangle of shifting definitions and special pleading. My energy is limited.I’ve discovered that for these guys, there is no “truth” except the truth of the moment, which may change the very next moment–the “truth” of the moment being identical with their self-interest.Rigorously logical Jews who give their own guys no special breaks–Paul Gottfried, Ron Unz, etc.–are perhaps literally one in a million. We should appreciate their work but can’t get NAJALTed by them.For Israel to exist as currently constructed, it needs a robust relationship with a robust America.LOL, I’m calling frog-and-scorpion on that.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scorpion_and_the_Frog

            My sense at this stage is there is not a lot of distance between Hazony and a Paul Gottfried. He would be comfortable talking at Mencken. The difference is Hazony is working within the narrower framework and is trying to remain within it. He’s also explicitly Zionist, while Gottfried is not.The fact is, we don’t really understand Jewish identity very well. What we get comes from anti-Semites and most of that is paranoid conspiracy mongering. For example, there are only two people I know who have written about the emotional impact of the holocaust on Jewish identity. Me and Hazony.

                You should read “The Wandering Who?” by dissident Jew Gilad Atzmon.Judaism and the Jew people were optimized for the ghetto and started to crumble when liberal government allowed Jews to access the mainstream of society.Jews want this access but don’t want to be assimilated and become normal Western people. This tension between assimilation and isolation explains modern Jewish history. For example, the participation in Communism or Zionism.After the WWII, Holocaust filled the void. It allows Jews to be separated (because they feel they are in danger) while making the most of Western society (no need to follow Orthodox Judaism). As Atzmon says, Holocaustianity has become the new religion that binds together the Jewish people, playing the role previously played by Judaism

                I’ve always just assumed that the Jewish Holocaust as taught to Jews* was, naturally, the ultimate emotional scar. In particular, they would be ashamed that they didn’t fight back, prompting them to become extremely militant to any perceived threat. In addition, they would now believe that “we’re playing for keeps” against white goys, particularly Christians. This is a fight to the end, two groups enter, one groups leaves.At least, that’s how I’d look at things if I was taught what Jews are taught.——–Note: I’m not trying to cause a stink here. No need to read further.*Based on very, very little research, I’m one of those that believes that millions of Jews were killed in WWII – along with millions of Poles, Gypsies, etc. Whether that figure is really as high as six million is debatable, and I simply don’t have a stance on it, though it wouldn’t shock me if the figure was closer to two or three million – a still horrendous figure needing no embellishment. In addition, I don’t believe that anyone has fully proved that the vast majority of Jews were killed in “death camps” specifically designed to exterminate people as opposed cruel work camps where Jews and other groups simply died of disease or just shot by Einsatzgruppen of various nationalities across Eastern Europe. Btw, both camps lead to the same thing so not sure if one is that much more cruel than another.My point here is not to open a debate on the Jewish Holocaust but to point out that what Jews (and everyone else) are taught about that event may – MAY – not be what actually happened, though there’s no doubt it was a horrendous and transformative event for the Jews. Of course, that’s true of most of the history that we’re taught, especially founding mythology, a category that the Jewish Holocaust seems to falling into these days.

                    If your people were largely responsible for killing 10s of millions of European Christians, the smart thing to do would be to form and maintain a narrative (reinforced by fellow tribesmen in the media, government, academia) that showed the very opposite, that your people were the ultimate victims and are people who should be protected by all peoples of the world, especially the bad whites responsible for victimizing them.

                Z: “For example, there are only two people I know who have written about the emotional impact of the holocaust on Jewish identity. Me and Hazony.”  You cannot be serious.  There’s enough books and articles on the subject to reach to the moon and back.  I must be misunderstanding you, because that’s one bizarre boast.

        I can only hope ZMan’s quixotic quest for the “good Jews” fails completely. Opening up the WN movement to Jews will make Charlottesville look like a dissident master stroke. The Hazony types are trying to open an escape hatch since they’re fearing we’re about to hit the other side of the Jew/Nazi cycle.
If all goes well he’ll have White identitarians agitating for nuking Tehran for the “White race.” They’ll subvert our movement the way the old Right was subverted by the Kosher conservatism of the Kristols and Podhoretzs: free markets, war for Israel, and the 14 words, goy!

            They’ll subvert our movement the way the old Right was subverted by the Kosher conservatismI doubt that’s going to work. Once you’ve started down the road of ethnic nationalism, there’s no turning back or stopping half way, and the Jews themselves make it abundantly clear that they are not European.That’s why they’re coming down so hard on ethno-nationalists, even if that should be their natural, political inclination. You can see the tendency in the kosher-right websites: they rile up the goys against Islam, but conspicuously fail to even mention authors who’re not solidly civic nationalists and they go full, frothing Hitler Derangement Syndrome at anyone challenging their CivNat gospel. They know that the endpoint of ethno-nationalism is Jews being told to go home to their own country.

                Jews in the Anglosphere and West Europe don’t move to Israel because it means a quite sizeable drop in living standards, and the peril of being drafted.
If the geopolitical winds shifted that the US loses its reserve currency status, and possibly even fractures internally…well I doubt 2 years in the IDF looks that scary.
Mass emigration from the West would also have an interesting echo in Israel, adding a bunch of secularist Ashenknazi English speakers.

                            It would probably have to come from Europe, where circumcision is a strictly Judaeo-Islamic practice. Last time they polled on the matter in Denmark, 80% were for a ban, and that’s counting the 8-10% Mohammadans.Even if most Americans have a personal… stake (sorry!) in the issue, I figure it wouldn’t be too hard to get an anti-circumcision movement going in the US, the think-of-muh-children card is pretty strong. Circumcision has no religious significance for heritage Americans, so a few graphic videos could probably do the job.And never mind the physical pros and cons, but it’s a pretty gruesome tradition any way you see it, a not-entirely-symbolic emasculation.

                                In my experience circumcision in the US is pushed as a choice – and a health issue.  There’s also very little connection made to Judaism – but a lot of connection made to “everybody else is this way and I don’t want my kid to be different”.
It’s almost become force of habit.

                                Felix – there is a nascent anti-circumcision movement in the U.S.  You’ll occasionally see bumper stickers that say things like “I wish I wasn’t circumcised”, and there is a documentary on Netflix called “American Circumcision”.Circumcision has no religious significance for heritage AmericansThis is less true than it should be. Americans in general take “Judeo-Christian values” to be a real thing, and evangelicals especially tend to view Judaism and Christianity as two sides of the same shekel.Generations of brainwashing by disinterested (((doctors))) led to very widespread circumcision among Protestant Americans.I’ve wondered sometimes if the Great Swarthening of America will be the end of circumcision here. It’s a nice thought, but on the other hand I’ve heard many people associate circumcision with whiteness, so the demographic squeeze may actually increase circumcision in whites. Obviously Europeans would find any association between white identity and circumcision laughable, but we’re a provincial people over here on our big island.

            I ask again, “How is Z different from the Republicans who welcomed the neo-conservatives because the neocons were anticommunists?”  Why does Z think that the results will be different this time?
If we welcome the based Alt-Jews because they dislike Muslims then we must support the idea that the USA is a proposition nation whose purpose is to protect Israel.  That doesn’t sound like progress to me.

                There is no masthead or editorships to be awarded, for starters.
There is also no purity spiral big enough that ends in the expulsion that many want. Rather, the feds would round people up long before they have a chance of sniffing power.

        If Zionism were authentically Jewish nationalism, in an honest sense, then that would have been best for everyone, but sadly it is not the case.  For Zionism to be truly Jewish nationalism, it would mean that ALL of the Jews, worldwide, would all finally pull up stakes internationally, admit that their alleged diaspora and “exile” was finally over at long last, and then they would all actually go back home and live in the Land they claim as their mystical birthright, while the rest of us breathed a sigh of relief.They did not do that, and will not do that — not ever.  The West is just too rich and ripe, the goyim are just too easily suckered, the shiksas are just too hot, and that sweet, sweet goyische blood is just such a tempting and intoxicating liqueur to sip.  The Jews are like the monster from “Alien” — virtually impossible to get rid of, it will always find a way to creep back in through the air lock, you just have to nuke it from orbit to be sure.  Next year in Jerusalem?  What’s wrong with this year?  In your dreams, stupid goy.The State of Israel is not the national homeland of the Jewish people, prima facie.  If it were, then they would all be there, and we wouldn’t be having this perpetual argument.  Instead, Israel is merely the gangster headquarters of a worldwide, international crime syndicate.  And that is how they intend matters to remain, having their cake and eating it too, and sticking you with both bills.  At least until they have finally eradicated the White people, and shifted operations to Shanghai and other points east.

                That’s not the reasoning at all.  A lot of Irish people left Ireland, often as slaves (see, for instance, Iceland), and generally became a part of the countries they went to.  The “Irish” in America are actually just Americans with a few sentimental attachments to the Auld Sod, like a shamrock kitchen ornament or a cable-knit sweater collection.  A generation back they had some ethnic rackets going on in the cities, like all the ethnics did, and some of them gave money to the IRA, but mostly they just drank Guiness, griped about Bobby Sands, and watched American sportsball.  They didn’t spend enormous, unimaginable levels of money and energy turning the entire geopolitical world order upside down in order to benefit Ireland.  The only real “Irish” these days are the ones living in Ireland, and I don’t mean the Nigerians.In politics and demography, scale matters.  And Ireland does not scale relative to Israel.

                        This line of “reasoning” is just not going anywhere; you’ve followed a trail of Logic Breadcrumbs into the Forest of Reductio ad Absurdum.  I’m not going to try to argue you out of it, I’m just going to honk the car horn so you can tell where the highway is.  Ireland and Israel, or the Irish and the Jews, are simply not things one should be comparing in these terms.  Your super-powers are far better put to use on other matters.btw, if the Irish who are /in/ Ireland don’t “get their Irish up”, and rather damn soon, about mass immigration, Ireland will stop being Ireland anyway.  Right now it’s on course to become Brown Beggar Storage Unit Number 487-C.

                        Up here there’s a ton of Irish.  I grew up in a mostly “blue collar” town that seemed to probably be about 75% Irish-Italian.If Jews stick together because of their religion and their heritage – I really don’t think you can compare them to the Irish.  As far back as middle school I picked up on the fact that the kids who were the least religious – were usually the ones being sent off to Catholic high school.  Having grown up around a Catholic majority – I really don’t see how most of them feel any sense of tribal coherence based around their religion.   There is an awful lot of intermarriage probably based on religion  between Irish and Italians in this area (and to a lesser degree French)  – but that is probably just based on a shared common experience as children , exposure – and just general population numbers more than anything else.Any conflict that may have existed with the WASPs who originally populated this region has long passed because of the preponderance of Irish/Italian in the area.  They also come from stock that immigrated here long enough past that they’ve had sufficient time (and motivation) to fully “integrate” and become Americans.Yeah -OK,  there was probably an undercurrent of support for the IRA in the 60’s and 70’s and even into the early 80’s – but that’s long gone and conflict is gone too.Sex, drugs, and rock and roll seem to have “integrated” the Irish and Italians fully into the “American experience” from what I’ve seen as much as anything else.South Boston hardly protests the gays marching in the St. Paddy’s Day parade any more,  and world of the American Irish portrayed by movies like The Departed – is no more.  Whitey Bulger is dead – and so is Ted Kennedy (good riddance to both)I supposed if the current day residents of Ireland can accept making a bunch of Congolese into “Irish” – they’ll also be able to accept a 4th generation Irish- American who is probably about 25% actual Irish now.  But sooner or later the logic of what they’re trying to push as “Irish” is going to completely fall apart.

                If sending the Irish back is the cost of sending the Jews back, I think about half of American-Americans would support it, and the other half would be looking to raise the Italians back to Italy and African-Americans back to Africa as part of the package.

        One more point.  There’s a going theory that Israel can defend itself because it has nuclear weapons.  Generally, that;’s true.  But the demographics of the middle east make Israel a drop in an ocean of people.  One day you’ll have an Arab leader (maybe a post monarchical Saudi Arabia) who’s so crazy he’ll say, you know what?  Yes, Israel can kill about 10 or 20 million of us with their nukes, but they’re going straight to Allah, and there’s 80 million more where that came from.  It’s enough to drive them into the ocean, a small price to pay.  Israel think’s Iran is just such a foe.  And that’s why they need the U.S.  And that’s also why they would have no problem sacrificing 20 million (just throwing out a number) Americans for their own existence.  Using everyone in their path, evangelicals, etc.   I’m not being anti-Semitic in saying this.  It’s what a smart group of people would do.  It’s political Jiu Jitsu.  And our politicians are such prostitutes that they go along with it.  And they know it.  And I wouldn’t be surprised if Epstein was a big Israeli honey trap for the degenerate Clintons etc.

A 100 years of pacification and corruption through industrialized consumerism, 80 years of cultural marxist demoralization, an abandonment of most of the ancient values and virtues, the pleasure principle, a firm, ingrained belief in the American civil religion and Democracy, a creeping, insidious belief that government should take care of all our problems, a lazy approach to education and keeping ourselves informed about what the hell is going on in our own freaking country, and of course human nature. Obviously this list is not comprehensive, but I’m sure you get the picture.

His observation appears to be that, present company excluded, we haven’t even begun to fight.  We do need a certain critical mass activated, and it is hard to tell where we are on that scale.  The 2016 election provided an interesting barometer (which seems to have spooked tptb).  2020 should provide an interesting measurement of progress/regress.

            JR;You’re right that wars start when deterrence fails.  And nukes are an excellent tool for deterrence. And, under the scenario you posit of fanatical leadership, even nuclear deterrence might fail.  But I doubt it.Most people in the West don’t seem to understand that most elites for most of history were deterred by the prospect of *their own* demise, period.  Casualties among the hoi poloi were/are just an unfortunate byproduct of business as usual.  The Acela Corridor elites during the Cold War hated Mutually Assured (nuclear) Destruction as a deterrent strategy because it made *them* hostages and not those icky rednecks in Flyover.^  *That’s* why there was all the ‘end-of-the-world stuff in media when it was pretty obvious that the world would not end in a nuclear exchange.  It was just their world that was going to end.*So I’d expect that the other elite members of the fanatical Arab leader you posit would take him out for the sake of their own survival.  As historical precedent, it is somewhat widely believed that Communist Party insiders took out Stalin in early 1953 because he was plotting nuclear war with us to finish the job of world-wide revolution.  It wasn’t that they objected on humanitarian grounds, it was that Stalin usually lead off aggression with a purge, a purge was gearing up, and they would become targets shortly.  Some of them on ethnic grounds._____________________________^ Furthering the victory of World Communism was, of course, an additional motivation for many of them.*No sane individual could wish for nuclear war and the death of millions.  I only assert that many would survive to rebuild civilization.  If Gaia could survive the Dinosaur Killing Astroid Strike, her recuperative powers are well more than what would be needed to snap back after a nuclear war (or global warming).

                Nort:  I think what you are saying is too objective and reasonable for that region and that religion.  Yes, almost all leaders are about self preservation first, but if you are a true literalist of the Koran, a true believer, nuclear deterrence will fail.  Every line of that book is about self sacrifice (alien to Westerners born after 1930) for allah the moon god.  The soviets were atheist, this was it for them,  20th Century Moscow was their heaven.  All blackness after that.  Nuclear conflict would be anathema to that line of thought.Interestingly enough, getting home from church today, we had your quarterly bring in a missionary for donations slide show.  It was a nice blonde suburbanite woman who’s made it her mission to go there and convert muslims to Christians.  I muttered in the pew, without knowing it “what a nice dead woman.”   I wonder if she’ll be beheaded or raped first.  Not joking.  These missionaries have a naive bent, I guess that’s what makes them missionaries.  It takes all kinds in this world.

        Nice read.   It seems the enemy these days are the so-called “Judeo-Christian Religions.”   The unholy alliance of Catholics, Methodists, Lutherans, etc.,  Mormons, AND Jews in promoting Cultural Marxism, Unlimited POC Migration( Legal &amp; Illegal), and One World Government is destabilizing the West at an alarming rate.The Church was the main instigator of the last civil conflict leading to the destruction of the Republic as founded and to the South itself.  And now with secular Jews controlling many of the levers of cultural, governmental, and economic power in America, stirring the pot as it were, the outlook going forward is ominous.The J-C’s thump their Bibles these days not to advance the Word of God, but to use it as a moral cudgel in service to One World Marxism.  And they will happily beat those Bibles into swords and kill whatever and whomever is needed to accomplish their objectives.  They are on a Moral Mission from God.Same as it ever was.

        Jews spend their entire lives being educated about how badly white people treated them in Europe. The ultimate lesson in this is the holocaust, which is now the basis of secular Jewish identity.
As to the need for a robust America, the Jews have a strategy to defeat China. America is going to throw open the borders until it has enough POC invaders to outnumber the Chinese. The NeoCons dream of a “billion Americans” to die in the forever wars against the Chinese, Russians and Iranians.

            “how badly white people treated them in Europe”
I was reading this fascinating book the other day.  It’s called “The History of the Jews in Europe: Two Thousand Years of Not Taking a F!cking Hint”.
Oy vey, the poor oppressed Wandering Jews, experts in wandering, could somehow not figure out how to wander back to the Middle East, where the Islamic regimes routinely welcomed them as bother Semites and staunch monotheists.
Instead, they stayed and “suffered” in Europe — as loan sharks, extortionists, tax farmers and slave dealers.  Like it says in the Torah: Location, location, location.

                There’s a book called Early Medieval Jewish Policy in Western Europe by Bernard Bachrach, which aims at combatting the “lachrymose conception” of Jewish history during the Middle Ages.  Im surprised it’s never been reviewed by OO or related sites.  In short things sounded not much different from how they are now.  For example, sometimes if Jews wanted to control a particular marketplace, they would take up arms and drive the Christians away!

                Valley: re: “suffering” in Europe: it’s what they do.From a cultural/relational perspective, they enjoy (consciously or unconsciously) the suffering.The martyr complex.Similar to Catholics. (And I am one.)
Interestingly, in my experiences, I have found we (Jews and Catholics) have  lot of cultural similarities, except for the one major one (Christ, savior of then world, alive in the Eucharist) that prevented me from ever marrying in that direction.

I can just see Jews attempting to join white supremacist organizations. The KKK would soon become the Jew Klux Klan. No more Grand Wizards. Instead, we would see Grand Rabbis leading mobs of sheet-clad men who go around burning the Star of David on black lawns.

        It’s been argued, successfully in my opinion, by Z Man that modern American blacks can’t exist without American whites.  I’m wondering if the same can’t be said about modern Israeli Jews, and if this book would be a head nod to that while attempting to add fig leaves to cushion the blow.  A country that’s 50% latino, 12% black, 15% Asian would have as much interest in Israel as Brazil, maybe even less.

            Rogeru said: “WE’RE DOOOOOOOMED!!!” Indeed. But not just because we may, in the end, have to link arms with B’nai B’rith. Z Man said: “When reading Yoram Hazony’s book, The Virtue of Nationalism, the image that keeps coming to mind is of a man working a puzzle, only to keep arriving at an unsatisfactory conclusion. There’s the period where it feels like it is all coming together, then that moment when he realizes the emerging answer is all wrong. Not factually wrong, but unacceptably wrong. After a brief moment of terror, he then throws his work into the fireplace and begins again with a fresh sheet of paper.” Here’s how I see it. All of the ” puzzles ” of life in general have been figured out ages ago. While we run around looking, looking, looking for new answers to our present predicament, the ancient wisdom of our ancestors lay strune about gathering dust. Don’t get me wrong. Reading is one of my greatest pleasures in life. And acquiring new knowledge from modern thinkers is very rewarding. Think of it this way. The Bible in several places talks about “redigging the ancient wells.”  When a people build a life and time knocks it down, they don’t have to try a reinvent the wheel.

        He implies an ethnic basis for a state but makes an argument that its function as a proposition nation outweighs ethnic concerns. Really?And where did the sentiments for those ‘propositions ‘ of the proposition nation arise from? He ignores his implication:biology.80% of Jewish males and 50% of females can genetically trace their origin to the Middle East.  An Ashkenazi Jew living in Frence for 1500 years is closer genetically to a Sephardic Jew living in Morocco than he is to a Frank.  Does he really believe that biology does not manifest itself as the driving force in group identity and interests or is he lying?So his ethno state masquerading as a proposition nation is justified, but France or Germany as a homeland for the ethnic French and Germans is too ethnic and too little ‘propositional’ to be justified?This is the most ‘Jewey’ argument I’ve heard in a while.

            This Hazony guy is not worth reading in seriousness because he’s not writing in good faith, he’s just doing due diligence and hedging his people’s bets.  Like all matters regarding Jews, he’s simply making sure both sides of the street are covered, so that no matter which way the coin drops on the nationalist question (or any question, really), the Jews come out on top, and the shekels continue to flow.Can’t blame him, I suppose.  But all the same, it’s high time that any time any Jew opens his mouth on matters regarding the disposition of the West and White people, he’s roundly told to STFU.  No matter what a Jew’s opinion is on such matters, it will never be in good faith, by definition.

I have a couple of ideas: prohibit circumcision and dual citizenship.
Otherwise, we should keep on doing what we’re already doing – it’s working. As Jared Taylor noted, before social media, American Renaissance would reach 4,000 subscribers, today they are read regularly by about 100,000.

                    Ban usury and porn.
I used to scoff heartily at the latter suggestion, but to my amazement, I’m coming around to your point of view, and I’m notthatold.
If by usury, you mean rent on money, I’m not on board. Banks are immensely useful institutions, the problem is that they’re currently in the hands of our enemies.

                    Good luck with that.
You’ve got a population that thinks that having the Federal Reserve print funny money is perfectly ok – and you’re going to eliminate usury?
That’s going to be a very long hard road…………..

                The dual citizenship thing is a good place to start.
Far too many examples of Israeli affiliated individuals exhibiting disloyal behavior while holding dual citizenship.
Up in this area I’ve even seen people run for office and BRAG about the dual citizenship thing since they obviously think it’s a selling point.
Seeing this behavior has peeved me off about the dual citizenship thing for probably a good 15-20 years now.

            We should welcome Antifa protesting an explicitly Zionist conference. We love saying that “anything to the right of Bin Shapiro” will be banned. Well, maybe if Shapiro was banned it would start the alarm bells ringing.
The whole idea is that this Woke Mob will be controlled, but what if it isn’t. There are some signs that Antifa is becoming less disciplined.

Well, maybe if Shapiro was banned it would start the alarm bells ringing.”  I can certainly sympathize with your ideas. But there’s an old adage in the sports world. “Kill  the head and the body dies.” Here’s a quote from  Sun Tzu, “The Art of War.”  “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.” Antifa is a tool of the Progressive beast. Who’s in charge? Who controls the money? who coordinates the logistical support. Is it different for every part of the country, or is there some sort central authority. Those would be just a few good things to know. Try to identify the leadership and screw with those people. Here’s a website discussing military tactics. Food for thought.https://defensesystems.com/articles/2010/04/26/cover-story-getting-inside-the-enemy-decision-cycle.aspx

                    Antifa is made up of “anarcho-communist” that organize in “collectives” which form into the black bloc. They formed out of existing anarchist, anti-war groups. One might be tempted to call DSA their “civilian wing”.
They benefit from benign neglect from the system, and the interference of the National Lawyers Guild “green hats” which prevent them from getting felony convictions.
The structure of antifa makes it difficult to defeat, but rather easy to disrupt.

                        Antifa have not been a problem in Denmark since the nineties. Back then, a referendum had not turned out the way they wanted, so they proceeded to burn down a borough of Copenhagen.The police opened fire with hard ammo and later went around the emergency rooms, arresting gunshot victims. If they were too poorly off to be moved, they were handcuffed to the hospital gurney.Now, the cops had fired more than 100 rounds into the crowd, but nobody had actually died, so the upshot was that they upgraded their sidearms from 9mm full jacket to 10mm hollow-point.Antifa have been toeing the line since.Here’s some footage from a Commie local television station – the fireworks starts at 2:45https://youtu.be/oNcLsvHpSD4?t=165

        This sentence is troublesome:  “If a nation can decide who it allows in, based on its own internal logic and customs, then there can be no moral basis for opposing racism or antisemitism, as both are just natural extensions of nationalism.”Can’t tell from the context who is making that statement but I assume it’s your take on Harzony.  Sounds like Harzony is conflating two very different things.  Regardless, making the moral distinction between nationalism and racism is important.  There’s no hate in repatriating Haitians to Haiti, or Cubans to Cuba, as I spent the bulk of my career doing just that.  Big difference between race-realism and racism.

            You’re assuming racism is always immoral. Since choosing your own team is not only moral, but a moral duty, racism cannot be immoral. It’s the natural result of failing to maintain peaceful separation.

                While that is all true, it’s also true that being labelled a “racist” today will have a very negative impact on one’s life, such as ending a career, destroying ties with family/friends, etc. The reality is, one cannot promote the idea of race realism by calling it “racism,” that word has strong negative connotations to it. Semantics, but important. Maybe “biological reality” or something like that could be reachable for normal folks? The subject is a raw nerve for many.Hazony may be trying to wisely signal to his tribe that caution should be exercised in destroying white Christian culture, but Hazony’s defense of nationalism also is an entry to nationalists and dissidents for Hazony &amp; co. David Horowitz just came out with his book in defense of white Christian civilization; he’s also making entry to nationalists and white Christians — all those wonderful Zionist Christians must go gaga at this stuff. It’s always about “Is it good for Jews?” They are attuned to the political environment and, sensing the rise in nationalist sentiments, are skilled at having members of the tribe on all teams, taking all positions; it’s in their nature. Like Babe said, the frog and scorpion story! Overall, it’s good that the subject of nationalism is being more thoughtfully discussed or being discussed at all. Just note who is steering all discussion of it. (As usual.)

                    To avoid such negative impacts, simply rebrand “racism” as multiculturalism.  Isn’t that what nationalists want after all – a place for each culture, and a culture for each place?  The ones forcing the Haitians to stay here are the true racists, denying them fulfillment of living in their own country, among their own people.  Progressive champion the ultimate form of cultural appropriation, stealing Haiti from Haitians by bringing them here, just so we can enjoy the occasional jerk chicken sandwich.

        Z great post.Now what’s good for the goose is good for the ganders.But I am beginning to get a feeling, a hunch…that grows…That if we live long enough we’ll see Israel repress the Jews.A hunch.  That’s all.Israelis are a healthy, vigorous people and the Diaspora is not.   The American one is certainly not.  Israel wants to live.  The Left everywhere however wants Western Civ to die.  This is essentially a negative goal of annihilation.I don’t think they’re to blame for our problems.  We are.We are weak minded and soft.Someone was going to come for us.  Latin Americans certainly aren’t Jewish.Yes the Left is sick, but Protestantism became very sick all on its own.  Frankly I think the Protestants couldn’t resolve the conflict between faith and reason- the conflict between science and belief in God.   So God faded.   Now science has died as well.We’ll discover the need to fight and the need for God through trial and suffering.But its interesting he wants Israel to live on without the ahh… question or (((them))) ruining it.   Because they will.We have many problems.This is just one.

        Z man, would love your opinion on Whiteshift. The book left me dissatisfied. Kaufman acknowledges that in multicultural America, whites have interests like all other groups and should not be held back from expressing them. He then also states that whites as group are shrinking in size. They will then have two choices-preserve themselves in white enclaves or miscegenation. He favors latter and believes we will have a new breed of latte Americans who will identify as white who will honor America’s past and culture. He then goes on to blast both multiculturalism as too disunifying and civic nationalism as too shallow. He then comes up with the concept of multivocalism which seemed difficult for my dense brain to understand. I am quite frankly surprised Jared Taylor likes the book. I do wonder if he has read it.

            The author is a moron. Everything in modern America elevates non-whites and is constant war with the past. You get government goodies for the mere fact of being non white. Safely tucked in Academia, Kaufman builds his thesis on the idea of white privilege. If white is a privileged group, then non whites will want to be white. Instead, we have aryan Mexicans declaring they arent white becuase their great grandfather marched with Santa Anna. Normies think that the ability to tan means you aren’t white.So we have three forces acting against the white shift ever happening: Affirmative Action, the Democrats One Drop Rule, and the war on history. It boggles the mind that so many on the DR can’t see this very obvious sociology.

As I said above  “…a lazy approach to education and keeping ourselves informed about what the hell is going on in our own freaking country.” There’s a general laziness about education to be sure. But in white people it’s particularly ugly and dangerous because we are the scapegoat. White people will continue the be blindsided by the current year untill they get a full understanding  of the situation we face, so coalitions can be formed and plans made and put into action.

        Using the term “the levant” implies that there are many legitimate claims to Israeli territory, and hence anything else written will be considered anti-Semitic, and thus taboo.

        Re:” The last section of the book, which most reviewers apparently skipped, offers some very interesting insights into Zionism. In chapter 22 he writes about the shame Jews feel over not having fought back against the Nazis and how this is integral to Jewish nationalism and national identity. Instead of Jews being a people whose men and women stood helplessly as their children were murdered by the Nazis, Israel is a nation of armed men and women defending their children.”There is also evidence out there that at least some of the Zionists actually cooperated with the Nazis initially as a way of forcing the issue for the creation of a Jewish state.  If true – then it lays waste to the “stood by helplessly” argument , because at least some elements within European Judaism would have been actively working the overall issue to what they felt was their best advantage in the longer run.

        Ah no Sir.
Their fate rests with us.
That’s the way it must be, and the way it is.  Israel knows this.
In exchange they welcome their troublesome prodigals back home.   We’ll all be healthier and safer.
And if they don’t like it there’s nothing they can do.
I’m not in favor of group punishment or mass expulsion for the group but that is probably a wish too far.

        Of course, the other problem with nationalism for the Zionist is the case of the Arab minorities in the Levant. If a nation is defined as a people with a common language, history and territory, then why can’t the Palestinians have a country? Why are their claims against Israel not valid? In chapter 17 Harzony resolves this by refining his definition of nationalism to limit it only to those who can attain a nation. In other words, everyone can have a nation, if they can get it and keep it.The implication of Zionism (and is Biblical) is that God raises up nations and lowers them. That’s the theological framing of nations who rise win wars and nations who fall lose.There is some argument in Hazony’s book that wars of aggression are immoral attempts to destroy another nation and that defensive war is moral. However, you can’t really outright say that because Israel was a nation with no country who waged aggressive war among the inhabitants of the land they wanted.That’s also the nub in where America’s founding is defended as the “new Jerusalem,” because we had defectors of other countries coming here to settle land that “belonged” to other nations. Through winning wars, it was claimed for those new nations that later made up the USA.So, caught between a rock and a hard place, Hazony has to, after laying the groundwork, back off of the obvious conclusion – that winning aggressive wars for territory is a legitimate means to building a nation. For all his problems with post-war progressivism, he can’t go that far.I’m totally good with God’s ways are not our ways, that the Bible lays out just war methods, and that they seem very horrifying to modern sensibilities (they were so harsh, even Israel ignored the rules at the time). However, they are the only real ways you can build and preserve a nation.

            It might also be relevant to add that another implication of Hazony fully committing to this logic of rising and falling nations, he admits that the fall of Israel in 70 AD was just.

        Z Man said: “That is the real argument of the book. Harzony puts no effort into explaining how his conception of nationalism could be applied in Europe or America. Instead, his argument is that Zionism, Jewish nationalism, is both the pure form of nationalism and the best form of human organization. It allows a people to chart their own destiny, but also prevents one nation from meddling in the affairs of another. A world composed of naturally occurring nation-states would be peaceful and prosperous.” Nicolás Gómez Dávila said: “Peace does not flourish except among moribund nations. Under the sun of iron hegemonies.”  And this. ” The state is totalitarian by its essence. Total despotism is the form towards which it spontaneously tends.” And last but not least. “Whoever does not turn his back on the contemporary world dishonors himself.” Well, maybe that last one is a bit extreme ( but I can relate). In my mind, everything keeps coming back to who people are and not just the government they live under. Who are the American people that would give there lives to salvage what’s left of the good old U.S.Of A? I don’t have the answer to that but I know this. A Nation is only as good as the people who live in it. There’s around  331,195,364 legal citizens in the U.S. and about  198 million are White. How many would give their lives to keep the old ways? And how many would be the kind of people that could preserve it once they had it?
