        It is telling that increasingly (certainly here in the UK) that people need licences to do what they have always done for free, other than the normal risk factor.I was astonished (well, a little) to discover the other day that licences must be sought by fishermen for going out into the wild seas to get a catch. Of course, a lot of this licence fee goes to the well-paid people who issue them, so it is a self-satisfying circle of bureaucracy.Foreign trawlers can either get the licence or ignore them and thus fish the seas to emptiness because it is hard to catch up with them. For the trawler men of Aberdeen or Scarborough or Welsh Wales, getting away from the baleful eye of the licence-gatherer is way tougher.

            I read once that the UK has regulations on pallbearers. If the weight exceeds a certain amount, it is against the law to carry the deceased to the grave or out of the church. I guess if every aspect of your life is overseen by the custodial state, then you death may as well be regulated as well.

        As for the lower level employees, I suspect that it does not startle people much when they learn of or experience for themselves a Madame Mao impression from agents of OSHA or EPA (I had an out of body experience with an OSHA agent), but there may as many of them in BLM and Fish and Wildlife now, which at one time surprised me.
