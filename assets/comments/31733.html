        I don‚Äôt think the petrodollar is as important as it once was. It was the corner stone but now the structure is built. SWIFT is up and the dollar is ubiquitous. We don‚Äôt need Saudi Arabia to force the world to use dollars. They use dollars because all the systems are there to perform the functions they need to perform in dollars, and no other currency can do that job.The question is; what are going to do to screw that up?  However, there is another consideration. The needs of Americans do not necessarily align with the needs of the world, and the dollar cannot fulfill both at once, and one will lose. This has always been the problem of a national currency being reserve currency.

        Z;  I have deployed 0 zero times for Israel, I deployed at least Twice for Saudi Arabia, aka Desert Storm and OIF (Iraqi Freedom).   The üá∫üá∏ü©∏ was for oil, not Jews.The official US Foreign Policy for Israel since last April is One State Solution, here‚Äôs Foreign Policy the magazine for the CFR / Council on Foreign Relations telling Israel to give the Palestinians the Vote last April.   That‚Äôs Israel‚Äôs destruction ala South Africa, although it would really be the Belgian Congo.   Israel is supposed to DIE.   Bibi is just refusing.   So are the Israelis.   This is the real Israel lobby.https://www.foreignaffairs.com/middle-east/israel-palestine-one-state-solution?utm_medium=newsletters&amp;utm_source=twofa&amp;utm_campaign=The%20World%20Beyond%20Ukraine&amp;utm_content=20230421&amp;utm_term=FA%20This%20Week%20-%20112017This is what the Israeli Supreme Court fight was about.  The Israeli Supreme Court is to give the Palestinians the vote.  The actual powerful Israeli lobby wants Israel to surrender and become a combination Syria and Congo overnight.   The US liberal rich Jews like Wexner bought the Israeli liberals the last 30 years.   This is why the Israeli Left has only a handful of seats.Far from powerful the Israeli lobby that hasn‚Äôt been co-opted is very weak, just enough to stave off Bibi as Somoza so far.    We‚Äôre üá∫üá∏ betraying them to destruction, as we have so many others.That‚Äôs what America does.  This is all we have done since 1945.   We‚Äôre even betraying Europe now, just in stages.   Betrayal is all the American Imperialists have to offer.And no I‚Äôm not Jewish or a Zionist. Our only American interest is to stop betraying everyone domestic and foreign, in this case the inability of the DC system to decide either betray Israel or get Trump/MAGA : they tried to do both and are losing America and their hated rival.IF you knew anything about the American Foreign Policy personnel you‚Äôd know they‚Äôre in the Saudi and Gulf Arab‚Äôs pockets, not the Jews.The Israelis by the way aren‚Äôt Jews as we know them, the Jews we know are American‚Ä¶ and happily sold out their own‚Ä¶Except HAMAS screwed it all up.

        Important to keep in mind the big political realignment that is going on, and that accelerated in 2016.Democrats are the brown party.  The geezers are barely holding on at this point.  As they die off, the next gen is browner and much more stupid.  That is going to further cleave the country on racial lines.  So-called Hispanics are slowly assimilating, and they are evolving in ways Democrats did not expect.  Hence the panic waves of illegals to try and overwhelm the system.  If allowed to assimilate gradually, they‚Äôll break 50-50.The GOP has a worse problem.  Their rejection by voters is staggering.  Johnson has turned out to be every bit the fink Z predicted.  (I had my doubts, but figured he deserved a chance.  He chose fink.).  Trump just wiped out 10 years of eGOP scheming like he was cleaning a drop of mayonnaise off the kitchen table.  They just pushed all their chips onto the table with a pair of 3‚Äôs and lost to a guy holding a straight flush.  These clowns now say they won‚Äôt vote for Trump and they are being told in no uncertain terms ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let the door hit you in the ass on your way out.‚Äù  The GOP as we know it likely doesn‚Äôt exist after this election.MAGA is better off forming its own party.  The GOP has so thoroughly debased itself ‚Äì they helped pass the green new deal, for example ‚Äì that the party organization itself might not be able to self finance soon.  Their donor rolls have collapsed.  Only Trump is keeping them afloat.That great political realignment is still playing out.  Politics doesn‚Äôt end just because elections are fake.  Chuck Schumer is just play acting the usual Democrat garbage.  What‚Äôs going on behind the scenes is white Democrats getting overrun by diversity and the GOP being lit on fire by its base voters.The Israel crap is a side show distraction combined with the usual money laundering.

            The white exodus from blue states is real. That‚Äôs why the illegals are mostly being settled in blue states. So they don‚Äôt lose their house representation and electoral college votes. They already cheated on the 2020 census, NY and IL are overrepresented and FL and TX under. But with the influx of illegals the false numbers are made true.
Some percentage of the post Trump invasion ramp-up is motivated by TDS. Because the Orange Hitler is against illegal immigration, turning it up to 11 must be the moral and right thing to do.

                I don‚Äôt think it has anything to do with democrats thinking it‚Äôs the moral or the right thing to do, it‚Äôs just petty and childish spite and revenge and of course what they see as sticking it to republicans and white pepo.

        A reply to daBears and Wolf Barney below, re daBears ‚ÄúDespite the massive imbalance of forces in Israel‚Äôs favor, heritage Americans believe the Israelis are the under dogs.‚ÄùIn 1967, despite the triumph of a successful bear-baiting and subsequent attack and defeat of their Arab neighbors, the world wasn‚Äôt loving Israel enough.How to win the love of the U.S.?A New York public relations firm was hired for $10 million; after a year of surveys and research, the answer came back: America loves plucky underdogs.Therefore, Israel, you must become the plucky underdog, the beaten-down victim, and not the colonialist oppressor‚Ä¶and the Holo myth suddenly appeared in the 1968 Encyclopedia Brittanica, where no entry for it had ever been before.By 1976 there was a tv movie special starring Meryl Streep which appeared on German television.  It had staffed phone banks and a number listed so the perplexed viewers could call in to get their questions answered, because the German viewers had never heard of this ‚ÄúHolocaust‚Äù event until this time.

            No, no, I take this back somewhat; the p.r. firm was hired by the Arab League, and the Palestine Liberation Organization was born with Soviet-trained Yasir Arafat as its spokesman.Forgive me, my bias is speaking; a plague on both their houses.Although the Israel statements are true, the Palestinians were also told that they, too, must be a plucky underdog to win sympathies within the Soviet UN bloc and anti-war Europeans.Both were engaged in invoking different versions of the same story, I don‚Äôt know which jumped the lede first.Either that was a case of opportunistic double-billing by enterprising p.r. salespeople, or the small Manhatten ad community was gossiping with itself.(I do note that the Arab League did not get their own billet in the Encyclopedia, nor a Hollywood produced tv movie, despite T.E. Lawrence of Arabia, and the Palestinian Mandate territory.It turns out Balfour, at the direction of Lord Rothschild, had made the same promise of alliance to both Jewish financiers and Arab oil sheiks to win their cooperation away from the Ottoman-friendly Germans and their competing railroad network, as well as versus the Havarra Transfer program into an Ottoman millet 15 years later.  Hitler built Israel, not the British Crown, nor the French Republic, which had split Syria Palestina in two halves in 1924 under Sykes-Picot authority.)

        Israel may be looking for ways to ditch the U.S. as a liability since U.S. hegemony is coming to an end and the dollar may soon be dethroned as king. If Israel can make itself useful to the new pan-Asian hegemon, that‚Äôs where Israel‚Äôs future may lie. The Palestinians are the darlings of progressive America and the alt-righters that have it in for the Jews, not so much Israel‚Äôs Arab neighbors who may have little desire for the Persian Shia  to gain purchase, via their Hamas/Hezbollah proxy, in their contest with Arab Sunni‚Äôs. Israel can look to position itself as the Taiwan of West Asia, let the others battle it out. What we in the media-driven West respond to are optics, and we interpret George Washington‚Äôs comments in that light.

        Schumer‚Äôs demand for Netanyahu‚Äôs ouster is an Israeli internecine conflict wrapped in an American delusion. It is another manifestation of the Israeli protests over the latter‚Äôs judicial reforms, as the Israeli courts are the last bastion of Ashkenazi political control in that country. American Jews in positions of power are decidedly Ashkenazi in their sensibilities. Netanyahu, despite his own background, represents the Sephardi/Mizrahi Jewish body politic. The American delusion comes into play in that faced with an unwinnable situation abroad, maybe even a defeat, the solution is always to try and overthrow the leader of your opponent, since whoever replaces them is sure to be more amenable to your wishes. In fact, behind Netanyahu are a lot of potential Israeli leaders even more opposed to any sort of accommodation with the Palestinians than he is. His replacement (like Putin‚Äôs in Russia) would likely be a whole lot worse from an American perspective. As usual, America is stuck with the losers and will probably win the booby prize again (i.e. refugees).

        It is not just Arab/Muslim voters in Michigan. It is the far-left base of the Regime.At the Gay Superbowl, producer/director Jonathon Glazer (‚ÄúZone of Interest‚Äù) in his Oscar acceptance speech blasted his own ((())) and sided with the Gazans and declared his solidarity with Gaza and called the State of ((())) evil and successors to Yatzhee. His movie btw was about a Commander and his family adjacent to the ‚Äúzone of interest‚Äù and their ignoring the screams emanating from said place.Hollywood is the most anti-meritocratic place on the planet. People who consistently fail but adhere to the ‚Äúmessage‚Äù and have the right identity prosper: Kathleen Kennedy, Leslie Hedland (former Weinstein assistant). Those who consistently make money hand over fist are merely tolerated: John Favreau, Eli Roth etc. Glazer would not have made his speech if he did not think it would advance his career greatly, which it has.Now various leaks indicate that the US will withhold arms to Israel particularly shells and missiles. It would not shock me to learn we are suddenly at war with Israel over Gaza, as the ‚Äúprotector‚Äù of Gazans with the idiot port facility being built. Which guarantees American boots on the ground fighting Israelis to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù Gazans and Hamas. [The two are the same.]The logic and emotion on the Left, which includes the great majority of ((())) in the West, demands the destruction of ((())). There is no ‚Äúnuance‚Äù in global politics, which is what the dissolution of nation states in the West has left us. There is only civilizational politics. Schumer knew what he was doing which is not ‚Äúnuance‚Äù but getting rid of that nation as the inevitable harvest of the Colors of Benetton.Sorry, quoting George Washington is like quoting a  Roman Emperor. Of interest only in understanding a long vanished people and worldview. America no longer exists and has not for a very, very long time. It is just a place on the map that is a global extended stay hotel where everyone pretty much hates every other group. Washington‚Äôs advice has no bearing on what to do in the Global Holiday Inn Express when the group in the other suite wants you dead. The nation is dead, it is never coming back, it is all global tribes now.

        To control the dissent, lead the dissent.
Right from the git go, the anti gazacide protests were lead by jewish voices.   Schumer has had to run out in front with his baton to lead the parade.   But it‚Äôs just the old one state, two step shuffle, all the while Schumer and ilk are picking off the gazans,

            I noticed there haven‚Äôt been any synagogues burned down or Jews murdered which seems odd given the number of angry mussulmen in this country.  There might be something to the idea that the Jews are jumping in front to direct all the left wing outrage into impotent protests so they can feel like they did something.

            That seems to assume that one is required to oppose genocide everywhere, whenever and wherever it happens. Like a world policeman. It is possible to recognize genocide, which is a word with a definition, without taking sides in it.

                Of passing interest is the very term did not exist until after WWII, and had difficulty being taken seriously when it referred to the slaughter of Poles, until they added in Jewish Poles.
Though I guess that would explain something else I‚Äôve wondered about. A conquered people often adopt customs or language of their overlords.

                    The term ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù was coined by a Jew describing the Armenian Genocide. There were many Jewish and other witnesses to the Armenian Genocide. That event, it was actually a series of genocidal events, is where the Jews got their best material in fashioning the Holohoax. Mere pograms paled in comparison and the hymies needed additional material for their schtick.

            The goal of the chosen for the palis is somewhere between what our ancestors did to the natives and what the painter is alleged to have done to the chosen.
Call it what you want.
Explicitly recognizing your highest loyalty clarifies these questions.
I benefited from manifest destiny and I don‚Äôt regret it in the least.
I see a similarity between my people now and the palis.
There is no inconsistency, if your highest loyalty is to your people, rather than to some universal morality.  As it was for most of human history.

God, family, country. No, my highest loyalty is not to ‚Äúmy people.‚Äù
There is a lot between family and country, too. Community, for example. If you think I am more broken up by a death in New York than one in my own community, you are gravely mistaken, and, if it‚Äôs not the same for you, I think you need to examine your priorities.

        Democrats are in danger of losing the far left side of their base due to sympathy for the plight of the Palestinians. The Speech was intended to reduce tendencies to defection by that element while at the same time isolating Trump as a zealot in favor of unrestricted support for Israel, thus offending a significant section of his base.

Are you saying that the money I decided against giving to the pro-fellow white white whites at AmRen (and was instead going to give to Hamas) I should now just give directly to the fellow whites at AIPAC because that will give the fellow whites more power over the whites who represent the Empire which is oppressing me and thereby make the Empire collapse faster by getting us into a general war?

Hell, we also need planes at BWI to ferry every black welfare recipient in Baltimore and Washington there too. Minnesota and the upper Midwest can provide surly Sharia fans.

        ‚ÄúThe most important country in the region is not Israel, but Saudi Arabia.‚ÄùAs we all know, in a rational world, that would be true.  But while KSA exports oil, crucial for normal American‚Äôs, Israel‚Äôs number one export is blackmail (Epstein‚Äôs honeytrap empire, Israelis buying up most of the world‚Äôs VPN companies, etc), avoiding which is more crucial for the survival of rich and powerful decision makers.   As others have commented on, Zionists are the biggest block of political financial donors.  Add to that them killing JFK for trying to stop their nuclear weapons program as well as threatening to kill Truman for opposing their theft of a nation from the Palestinians and George HW Bush for trying to force peace on them, and having a hand in 9/11 to get the American populace fired up to go after their enemies for them ‚Äì and American decision makers who know all that getting the message to stay in line ‚Äì and it‚Äôs clear why our foreign policy is not a rational one.

        The Gazans are getting what they mostly deserve, when you overwhelmingly support groups that murder, rape, and kidnap concert goers you really don‚Äôt deserve to live. There is no right to exist as a bronze age, barbaric tribe that doesn‚Äôt seem to be interested in the modern world and the world is better off without these groups existing. China is right to stick Uyghur types like these people into camps, and it‚Äôs why I always laugh at normiecons who criticize the CCP for the camps. The camps are where these people belong and where they must be deprogrammed.

I assume that you‚Äôre a white guy in LA, San Fran, or Seattle getting overrun by hispanics and replaced by asians (including indians).
Can you feel some kinship with the palis, a people who have been out-competed and made obsolete, who strike out in futility against those who will soon snuff them out?
It‚Äôs you too, my friend.  I‚Äôm not saying you have to like the palis, I don‚Äôt, but you should appreciate the similar fates.

                Palestinians are frequently awful terrorists or support those types, Hispanics and Asians largely aren‚Äôt the same sort and I would oppose harming them. Shooting up an EDM concert (these are heavily Asian, particularly on the West coast) is unconscionable, and support for those sorts of acts is psychotic. However, I only see Muslims and the most unhinged Leftists (another religion) in support of these acts. Just because I don‚Äôt want to be flooded with Venezuelans, doesn‚Äôt mean I want to hurt them.The Dissident Right must understand that not all groups are equal, and some groups are so awful we are better off without them. It seems clear to me The Palestinians are unreasonable and are mostly just a violent cult (or supporters).

            The truth of the matter is that the Israelis and Palestinians deserve each other.  Both groups are so odious in their own way that to put them together in constant conflict on some tiny strip of desert strikes me as the ultimate form of karma.  This blood libel will never end and it couldn‚Äôt happen to two more deserving groups of people.

                This is where I‚Äôm at.  You have two tribes that have been stuck there because no decent country really wants them.Egypt, Jordan, etc don‚Äôt want the Palis.  Europe settled that question 80 years ago for the Jews.  Sure, there are large outposts here, but pretty much contained to costal/urban areas.As far as Schumer goes, when are Democrats not trying to get Bibi thrown out or put in jail?  It‚Äôs barely newsworthy that Schumer gave said speech.Democrats are faced with a third regional war on O‚ÄôBiden‚Äôs watch.  Even when they don‚Äôt say it, they say it, ‚ÄúANOTHER F-king war?  AYFKM?!‚Äù  They need a way out of this.  Trump‚Äôs last-century response is actually the one solution most likely to bring peace: prosperity.  Shit up, let‚Äôs all get rich together.  Gaza is prime real estate.  The only reason it‚Äôs a shit show is like Africa in general.  Africa is like that because it‚Äôs filled with Africans.  The Palis have shown no interest in making the most of it and getting rich.Except the ones living in towers in Qatar.The other problem DC has is that voters simply decided ‚Äúa pox on both their houses‚Äù.  It has made funding ANOTHER M.E. war a tough sell.  People got two failed wars in 15 years over there.  They‚Äôre uninterested in another.  To some extent, Schumer‚Äôs speech is just blame-shifting.  The funding is stalled because of that darn Bibi!  If he were removed, money would rain again.In an ironic twist of fate, and twist of the knife, the biggest threat to the corrupt GAE in a century is an anti war populist carnival barker whose last stint as President had NO NEW WARS started.  That‚Äôs looking very appealing to people outside the DC bubble.When in office, Trump successfully orchestrated a slew of bilateral peace treaties ‚Äì the Abraham accords.  Those were effectively ending war in the M.E.  It‚Äôs a good example of how he can be ‚Äúpro Israel‚Äù, but in a way that puts a fork in the mercenary wars and associated war profiteering.  It is lost on NOBODY that Trump was deposed to get the revenue streams turned back on.The greatest gift we could all be given is the freedom to stop giving a shit about those two peoples because we‚Äôve taken away the war profits, and they had to figure out how to behave themselves and make their situations better without our help.I think Gaza barely registers on people‚Äôs radar because they‚Äôre just sick of the whole thing and know we are powerless to change those people.

        Unbelievable that a country of only 7 million has about 100 nuclear weapons with sophisticated delivery systems, won‚Äôt sign any non-proliferation treaties, and has an openly stated policy that they‚Äôll independently trigger a extinction level global thermonuclear war if they don‚Äôt get their way‚Ä¶

                When Israel starts launching ballistic missiles over Europe into the North Atlantic and keeping their own people in such abject misery that the entire population is on the brink of starvation, they will have achieved North Korea status.
A quick reminder of what North Korea looks like, flanked by China and South Korea.

PRK is a giant gulag.
We shouldn‚Äôt soft shoe that nightmare just to score points against Israel.  The Israelis do plenty of things wrong in their own right.

I don‚Äôt think so.  They hate Netanyahu for partisan political reasons.  They want to see a leftist in control of Israel.

As far as caring, I‚Äôm with Citizen, and with you on this one.  I am no more interested in Gaza than I am in Israel.  I cannot speak for others, but my sole concern is the welfare of White people, which means I don‚Äôt want any more Israelis or Gazans  in AINO.  I take no side or interest in their endless quarrels.

No, but he should have.  Seems to me that anyone who still credulously believes the simple narratives about WW2 that they learned in school and Hollywood movies is still in the thrall of people we can clearly see to be non-stop liars.

            Yep, the first time I saw this directly was with the Obama administration.  Netanyahu was visiting and got a short ‚Äúofficial‚Äùmeeting with Obama, but then another State visitor arrived and Netanyahu was literally exited out the back door of the White House.
Lots of uproar‚Äîeven from Schumer‚Äîat the time.  I was confused and chalked it up to some anti-Israel sentiment of Obama.  Perhaps it was more anti-Netanyahu than anti-Israel.

            Hamas going telegenic beginning on 10/7 thwarted an America-sponsored color revolution in progress in Israel.Globohomo was at most one election away from permanent rule there, and it‚Äôs in a hurry, because Israel‚Äôs demographic trajectory isn‚Äôt as alterable as the Anglosphere‚Äôs has been.

        ‚ÄúOur ‚Äúfriend‚Äù Israel is happy to shower your representative with cash if he puts the interests of Israel ahead of the interests of you and your community.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs one way of putting it.  But the reality is our government is loaded with Jews with no loyalty whatsoever to the US.  Saying they have dual loyalty is a compliment they don‚Äôt deserve.  They are not representing any American constituency, but the state of Israel and Jews generally.  Obviously this goes way further than just Jews, but they are the ones keeping the money flowing.  Using their control of the banks, they are a corrupting force.

            ‚Äú Need to be careful backing Tibetan independence‚Ä¶‚ÄùSadly, the above is no longer relevant because there is no longer a Tibet, or rather a Tibetan *people* that occupy the land.  After the fall in 1950, the Chinese immediately began to ‚Äúrepopulate (?)‚Äù Tibet with ethnic Chinese.  Last I read this has made the Tibetan people a *minority* in what was their country prior to the invasion.  Tibet, as we have imagined it from myth, is now little more than an open air museum.Tibet is a good object lesson for Whites in this country, but we are a stupid people.

                I think it‚Äôs more ignorance and laziness than it is stupidity.If Whites with a brain and a normal level of loyalty to their own kind controlled the media and academic institutions, then the White masses would be thinking and acting a lot differently. Currently, the system selects and props up the worst of our kind. Traitors and shabbos.It‚Äôs not that something is inherently wrong with Whites, it‚Äôs just all the levers of information dissemination have been usurped from us. We are social beings and most tend to follow what comes down from the top. Kevin Mcdonald is a smart guy but he confuses the chicken for the egg I think. We might be more inherently altruistic than other groups sure‚Ä¶ but that was always tempered by a healthy level of self interest before the last half century or so when the propaganda apparatus really got powerful. Movies are a great way to subtly manipulate people. Or at least were‚Ä¶ the small hats seem to have lost that ability in recent times. Disney is a joke now, for example.Speaking of that, a very good book to read on the topic is Jean Baudrillard‚Äôs ‚ÄúSimulacra and Simulation‚ÄùI highly recommend it.

                Compsci:  More than just Tibet as an example.  As much as I love English culture and history, I have to admit that England is historically responsible for the spread of Africans, Indians, and Asians around the world to suit the needs of its empire.  The Africans were the physically-hardier laborers, the Indians were the bureaucrats, and the Chinese were both, depending on location.Not to make a false equivalency between Tibet and Fiji, but the Fijians became a minority in what was their homeland in 1977 ‚Äì with about 35% of the country Indian and the rest Chinese and mixed ancestry.  Hindi is an official language.Anyone who claims this is AINO‚Äôs ‚Äòfuture‚Äô is blind to the realities of the present  . . . demography is destiny.

        Generational change is driving a lot of this turmoil. The founding generational leaders (and their kids) in Israel were pretty bellicose but they were a lot more pragmatic. Even Ariel Sharon understood that unlimited settlements into occupied territories were a bad long-run idea and he dismantled several on his watch to great public furor.Rabin‚Äôs assassination was really the end of pragmatism and the beginning of ‚Äúmaximalist‚Äù political attitudes in Israel. The Ashkenazi majority gave way to the Sephardic/religious majority and here we are. I met lots of Ashkenazi IDF veterans over the years in business and they were ‚Äútwo-state solution‚Äù guys almost to a man.This is true in Europe too. The Silent/Greatest generation leaders, having lived through the war as kids or having served themselves, were very focused on the balance of power and peace. Can you imagine Valery Giscard D‚ÄôEstaing, Georges Pompidou or Mitterand carrying on like Macron? Even many Boomers like Gerhard Schroeder, who lost his father in the war, sought good relations with Russia and wanted to make money with them. Merkel (an Ossi after all) started out this way too before she succumbed.Now we have a generation of politicians in Israel and Europe who have grown up under the US security umbrella, have no sense of Realpolitik, are totally committed to the ‚Äúglobohomo‚Äù project and stir up trouble nonstop for us and themselves. They are ‚Äúall in‚Äù. They will change only when they are out of chips.

Heh. It‚Äôs almost as though many modern leaders have never even read about what going toe-to-toe with The Bear entails.
In parallel with the decline of competence I see in the tech sector, this is mirrored most certainly by a decline in statesmanship. This used to be a serious thing, would you believe!

        ‚ÄúOnce the politicians see that there is no penalty for opposing this stuff, then the whole arrangement will begin to unravel. Israel‚Äôs control over Washington and the public debate over this relationship may have reached a tipping point and may no longer be tolerable.‚ÄùThis is an overly optimistic prognosis. Note that Schumer ‚Äî a Russian Jew himself ‚Äî is criticizing only Netanyahu. Netanyahu‚Äôs stock in Israel is rock bottom and he‚Äôll be ousted one way or another. Even US Jews must be having rather conflicted ideas about him and the genocide in Gaza. So Schumer has not made any rash move. But criticizing Netanyahu brushes under the rug the fact that the genocide has the enthusiastic support of a large section of Israeli society. Schumer will not mention this. It‚Äôs not just Netanyahu that‚Äôs the problem.The fact that Schumer is Jewish himself and a staunch supporter of Israel inoculates him from charge of anti-semitism. This also holds for Liebermann, but he apparently decided to make political capital out of Schumer‚Äôs utterances. If anything, Liebermann is even less scrupulous than Schumer (no mean feat). If you‚Äôre not Jewish you have to work twice as hard bowing and scraping to show your fidelity to Israel (Trump, Graham, etc., etc.). To paraphrase Avis Rent-a-Car, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not Jewish; we try harder.‚ÄùBut to return to the prognosis of a tipping point having been reached. This arguably won‚Äôt occur. Jews control and run the USA. The world can see it. Politics, finance, culture and entertainment, media, academia are all largely controlled by Jews. The goyim are largely silent bystanders here. The transfer of power from an Anglo-Saxon elite to Jews occurred surreptitiously over decades.

            I forgot to mention that the proposed ban of Tik-Tok, supported by both parties (incuding Schumer) seems to have crystallized because of ‚Äúanti-semitic‚Äù content on Tik-Tok (i.e., criticism of Israeli policies in Gaza). Note that tight censorship on Facebook stops any such criticism being posted. Glenn Greenwald posted a Youtube video about this a few days back:

Further evidence (as if any were needed) on the iron grip the Israel lobby has over the USA.

            And this state of affairs can only continue as long as the plates keeping spinning. In other words, the puppeteers must keep the fake economy rocking along at a high standard of living so as to keep the natives from getting restless. Which they know is an impossibility long term, and so they now have to fast-track a long-planned transition via reprogramming everyone into subservient sheeple. Which is working quite well in the EU, but will likely be much more problematic in the US due to high gun ownership. A problem which cannot be easily solved via attempted confiscation. And so, they must find an alternative way to depopulate and kill off as many alphas as possible. Hence bloody civil war.They don‚Äôt yet a good solution for the 4S &amp; Focus remedy.

            I honestly don‚Äôt know why ‚Äúnormie‚Äù continues to give a rats ass about what two Semitic tribes do to each other. As someone said prior, we managed just fine prior to the ‚ÄúGreat Return‚Äù in 1948 made possible by GB and the US. Ever since then they have been a royal pain in the ass for every administration, D or R. They have spied on the US, fired on US ships and stolen so much secret information that everyone is sure they have nukes (although I‚Äôm not convinced). The most aggravating part to me is they have convinced low info lumps of flesh that they are the victims, even as they completely control our banks, politics, entertainment and justice departments.

        It doedn‚Äôt matter that most of the US population has no enthusiasm for slaughtering children.
What matters is the rulers are largely of the same tribe that is doing the slaughtering and will never turn against them
Washington could not foresee the US being led by a hostile tribe that hates the American heritage population. Not could he forsee that the main priority of the American government would be ensuring that the US stays a slave to the ruling tribes‚Äô foreign country.
But that is where we are at.

            My Comment:  Washington, as an educated man of his time, surely was aware of Jewish proclivities and history throughout Europe.  Yet he reportedly borrowed money from them, and wrote the Jews in Rhode Island (a colony which legally legitimized uncle-niece marriage just for Jews) a letter extolling them.  Highly questionable behavior, even for the ‚Äúenlightenment.‚Äù

I wouldn‚Äôt go that far. The US population seems to tolerate the slaughter of a million plus children every year in the name of ‚Äúreproductive health‚Äù. Maybe if we could get that number down a tad I‚Äôd consider the possibility that the US might be acting on some moral principle.

            The mistake everyone makes is in assuming the neocons are Israel first. They are not. In fact, they have always been a bit skeptical of Zionism, but found it useful as a way to convince conservative whites to back their play. The neocons see Gaza as a huge problem for them.

                Really? Because from what I have read about Israeli polls and recent election results, new elections in Israel would result in someone even more hardline than BB taking power. The far right there has only been gaining support. Schumer and Graham are cynical liars who work for jewish interests above all else. This is an obvious scapegoating strategy to shift blame away from jews in Israel and the diaspora in the west now that their war has devolved into a PR nightmare.https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/29/far-right-makes-gains-in-israeli-municipal-electionsPainting White neocons and BB as the drivers of foreign policy seems pretty helpful in diverting blame away from the jews as a group and toward one man and White people as the scapegoats to me. Is that America first?So what play are the neocons making exactly with this other than scapegoating Whites tricked into Israel support by Osteen types (who definitely don‚Äôt work for jews, yup obviously) and assigning a fall guy and White Evangelicals/Anglos/neocons to take the heat off of jewish supremacy and divert the blame away from them and onto White gentiles and BB as a fall guy? Because I‚Äôd love to know how I‚Äôm wrong about that and how the Neocons are secretly actually putting their own interests above those of the jewish people public relations problems internationally.

            Nonsense!Washington is in full panic. As they should be: our esteemed blog host notes, both parties eagerly imported swarms of violent, stupid moslems to signal their virtue and import votes. It was inevitable that it would come around to bite them on the arse.The problem with moslems is that when they aren‚Äôt happy‚Ä¶they start shooting. And beheading. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôve been at the Jews‚Äô throats for 75 years. It‚Äôs only a matter of time before they realize that these American sellouts in the Establishment are just one caress of the trigger away from a well earned retirement. That‚Äôs assuming the home grown peasants and slaves don‚Äôt beat them to it. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre shrieking in panic when Trump started talking about bloodbaths.This can‚Äôt go on forever, Y‚Ä¶at some point it has to stop. At one time Israel made sense: the Empire needed a friendly ally in the Arab world and to a certain extent Israel filled the bill. But now they are no longer friendly and they aren‚Äôt trying to even pretend anymore. A week doesn‚Äôt go by where some rat faced jewish mutt in their community isn‚Äôt trying to spread anti-white hatred in the press or the judiciary, or the media, or in the schools, etc.The blinders are coming off; it won‚Äôt be long before the gloves come off too.

        I wonder if Trump is being allowed to win in order to have Republicans be the one to draw the heat forSupporting Israel‚Äôs warcrimes.Both factions of the uniparty support Israel and are partially responsible. However, the teaming brown masses will alway direct their hate at the occupant of the Oval Office.It must kill the plutocrats that their liberal power structure is taking the blame for the genocide when it could easily be redirected towards the Washington Generals by allowing them to win a token election.  Trump has already demonstrated his that he can be controlled and contained by the Washington.Will the Bushnells of the world burn themselves under a Trump presidency?

            ‚Äú‚Ä¶ Trump is being allowed to win ‚Ä¶ supporting Israel‚Äôs warcrimes.‚ÄùI suspect Pres. Trump is trying to cut some kind of deal with Jewish Israel-Firsters against the Jewish internationalists. There are two considerations. First, the only ‚Äòdeal‚Äô that matters would be complete deportation of all illegal alien invaders, not just the ones we have been infested with under Biden, resulting in a sea-change in our political and social culture. Is Pres. Trump even interested in leading this? Second, can the Jewish Israel-First faction even deliver their end on such a deal? Do they have enough power to neutralize internal opposition to mass deportations? Moreover, will they (assuming they have it) exercise said power? Another way to say the latter question is ‚ÄúDo they love their own children more than they hate us?‚Äù I think the answer is that their hatred of us will eventually override every other consideration, and that if they and the rest of the world must burn in order for us to be destroyed, then that will be their preferred outcome, irrespective of lamentations and hand-wringing along the way. Enoch Powell was right: it will be Rivers of Blood.

        Never, ever, ever underestimate the Jewish proposition that THEY are the ‚Äúchosen people‚Äù and must survive at any cost.

                Not so. The break between modern Talmudic (Rabbinic) Judaeism and the religion of the Old Testament (that they dismissively call ‚ÄúHebrewism‚Äù) was mostly complete 2000 years ago. Jesus even called out the difference ‚Äî Pharisees were the practitioners of the new breakaway faith.There are still some remnants of Hebrewism, which is little changed since Moses. but not many. For one reason, there‚Äôs no Ark of the Covenant, so they have to pretend something else can take its place, but feel guilty about it. But if you see any references to the Talmud (~2nd Century), you are talking about the guys Jesus called hypocrites.

                    Rubbish. The Book of Samuel says that Yahweh instructed the Jews to slaughter ‚Äúmen, women, children, infants suckling babes, camel and ass‚Äù of the Amalekites, ‚Äúand spare none.‚Äù
Long before the Pharisees, the Jews regarded themselves as ‚ÄúThe Chosen‚Äù and entitled to murder their enemies, like they‚Äôre doing today in Gaza. Not for nothing did Bibi quote the Book of Samuel a few weeks ago.

                        Hardly the only place, though that particular story is about the Hebrews disobeying God. If BB did so, maybe that‚Äôs a sign.
Check out Joshua sometime. It alternates between the Hebrews‚Äô obedience and disobedience, sometime sparing those God said to put to the sword.
I‚Äôm just saying that per the stereotype, modern Rabbinic Judaeism quotes the parts of the Old Testament they like, and overlook the parts they do not like. Just as Jesus said.

                Not only is this incorrect in terms of doctrine (see Steve ‚Äì the Talmud‚Äôs earliest writings are around 500 AD), this is also incorrect in ethnicity. The Hebrews were wiped out by the Romans. The relatively new term ‚ÄúJew‚Äù applies to a couple distinct ethnic groups (Ashkenazi and Sephardic).

        Actually, there is a real question about Israel‚Äôs ability to survive, US support notwithstanding. Iran began thinking very hard about how Israel could be defeated 30 years ago, and they came up with a brilliant asymmetrical theory of warfare that is going to bleed Israel to death. Alistair Crooke describes how this works. Move the time hack to 15:40 and listen very carefully as Crooke describe Israel‚Äôs dilemma:

        Israel‚Äôs power ‚Äì and Jewish power in general ‚Äì has been tied to US power since at least the 1960s, maybe earlier. The Israeli/Jewish lobby continues to hold power over US politics. (Indeed, I‚Äôm wondering if they have decided that Trump should be the president because he and the GOP are even more loyal to Israel than Biden and the Dems.)But, ironically mostly because of the Jews, US power is waning. Some of it is simply the result of the world moving forward. It‚Äôs not Jews‚Äô fault that China has become an economic and, somewhat, military super-power. However, it is their fault that Russia is now an opponent of the West.Regardless of blame, the US no longer has a military that can impose its will on anyone. It still can throw a mean punch, but it can‚Äôt sustain a real fight. That changes the game.More importantly, the world economy is changing. America and its minions are no longer the only game in town. China is the world‚Äôs largest economy. Russia‚Äôs natural resources are too important to blockade. India is a significant player. SE Asia will be the engine of growth over the next few decades.Basically, there are other players on the world stage both economically and militarily. The playing field is being leveled. The US is still a monster economy and military power, but it‚Äôs not alone.This means that America ‚Äì and by America, I mean its Jewish-controlled leadership ‚Äì has to actually deal with those countries as semi-equals. And, frankly, Jews just don‚Äôt do that well because they completely lack in self-awareness.You can see that with Gaza. Same with Ukraine. Same with China. They seem incapable of seeing the bigger picture, only viewing themselves as victims deserving to get a special deal. The rest of the world won‚Äôt put up with it, so it‚Äôs doing its best to move away from the Jewish American Empire (JAE).The rest of the world doesn‚Äôt want to defeat us. They want to ignore us. But being ignored is death to a middle-man people, so America continues to stick it large nose into everyone‚Äôs business. Luckily, the world is changing and that‚Äôs becoming more and more difficult.

            Chinese are talented people, but they wouldn‚Äôt be as far along today without Wall St. greed‚Äî sorry, muh Market Forces. Sending American manufacturing and capital to China, while educating scientists and engineers for them, will go down as an historically suicidal blunder.
As will importing people from every country the US has wrecked over the last 60 years. Lines up nicely with the immigration act, doesn‚Äôt it?
This country‚Äôs been run into the ground for a long time, looted for a long time. Now that muh prosperity (looting) is running out, people are finally starting to get it.

                Largely agree, except that it was not Wall Street greed. Businesses have been greedy, like, forever, so there had to be something else that changed.
Slowly, then all at once, government no longer was a guarantor of life, liberty and property, but became an activist force usurping it.
You can see the social destruction by watching a few episodes of 3 different programs ‚Äî The Honeymooners (mid ‚Äô50s), My Three Sons (early to mid ‚Äô60s) and The Brady Bunch (late ‚Äô60s). That was not the fault of Wall Street Greed.

                        Maybe? The UN started in, what, ‚Äô46 or so? NATO maybe ‚Äô48? Maybe it took 20 years or so for the international spirit to build?
Still not sure, though. You can blame it in part on Balfour, maybe, but that was hardly the only internationalist intervention by the victors of The Great War. Austria-Hungary was broken up, as was the Ottoman Empire, the Balkans, and, of course, Prussia, but unlike Balfour, none of those others ever caused any problems.

                Reminds me, I used to listen to AJ daily. Years ago, for a while, he would talk about Earth as an egg wrt colonizing space iirc. We develop, consume the albumen, hatch, leave the egg.
Same thing going on with the US, as far as I can tell.

        Because of open-ended alliances America‚Äôs entire credibility is tied to the defense of small, foolish nations that, because of that alliance, feel they don‚Äôt have to behave as small nations that avoid trouble. This encourages some of the baser instincts in man; the little guy with the chip on the shoulder suddenly poking a much bigger guy in the eye because he thinks he now has the cops right behind him. Because of this, to pick one example, the US is bound to defend Latvia, on pain of world war, even nuclear war, against what is probably the leading nuclear power. This allows Latvia to treat it‚Äôs Russian speaking subjects like non citizens, mouth off at Russia over Ukraine and just let loose all of the annoying small guy insecurities. Because they know America‚Äôs reputation, pride and honor is tied to Russia not bringing down the hammer on them.Why should the non-nuking of Montana be tied to Russia not losing its patience with an annoying little chump like Latvia, or the Ukraine for that matter? Only an idiot would make a strategy that bets the farm on what to the owner is a totally trivial issue. The more trip wires you set up the greater the probability that someone is going to run over one of your trip wires one day. So don‚Äôt stake the compatibility of Montana with vertebrate life on something not going haywire in some obscure corner on the other side the Globe

            However‚Ä¶it may be becoming evident that the US may not be able to come to the aid of these little piss-ant nations. Surely they noticed that NATO‚Äôs US-supplied ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù weapons systems were useless in Ukraine. And surely these little nations have also noticed that Yemen‚Äôs Houthi tribe have effectively closed the Suez Canal to traffic that is associated with Israel and its supporters‚Ä¶and that the US navy can do nothing about it.

                        good men failed to come together to stop evil men who collectivized‚Ä¶That‚Äôs true. As mentioned pretty much every time this comes up, a sufficient number of people chose bigger government and more collectivism at the cost of liberty.I‚Äôm kind of at a loss about what good people should have done, though. The Anti-Federalists were proven right early in Washington‚Äôs first term. Should they have hung Washington at that time? (Spoiler: Yes, they should have, but they didn‚Äôt and the rest is history.)Unquestionably, the last 3 years have ramped up the anti-white program substantially. Worse than ever in the entire US history. So, what should good men do? What should have been done these last 3 years?

        Well, I think the very long history on this sort of thing shows that there is really only one way out of this sort of problem. What is the number? 109?Look, These Christian nations who finally come to the same conclusion all certainly tried a reasonable approach first, you know? ‚ÄúHey, guys, do you think you could stop acting like your entire existence is predicated on complete hatred for all that‚Äôs good and beautiful in the world? At least for a few years, maybe?‚ÄùBut the answer‚Äôs always the same. They can‚Äôt stop. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some reasonable explanation that has nothing at all to do with the silly idea that their deicide and embrace of that guilt for all time placed them in some sort of relationship with the dark power. That is a silly superstition.It‚Äôs amusing to read Belloc‚Äôs _The Jews_, because he spends the whole book noticing weird things and then begging the Jews to please, for a minute, just freakin‚Äô stop being so destructive. He‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúGuys, in the industrial age, the concept of a pogrom takes on a whole different scale and implication. For your own sake, chill out!‚ÄùWell, they didn‚Äôt chill out. And they won‚Äôt chill out. And there is no mechanism in the US that can bring about any level of chill. Except the one mechanism that nobody is allowed to talk about.But that‚Äôs the mechanism.

            Belloc‚Äôs book is handy because I can present it to anyone in a post WWII world. Nobody gets the impression that Belloc is somehow offering either outlandish theories or hates the group on principle. If anything he is way too apologetic about European behavior.
Belloc was first and foremost a historian, and there the book the shines.
All that said, though that his solutions in the book amount to ‚ÄúPlease Jews, stop being so clueless!‚Äù That was not going going to work. It‚Äôs easy to see why exile ended up the preferred solution.

        This is probably a set up so that the ‚ÄúCongressional Angels‚Äù  will save the day and come up with a plan to send the bulk of the Gazans to America and Europe.   It‚Äôs for the children you see.Good old Bibi is reportedly big into the Zionist manifest destiny project.   That includes the expansion of Israel.   Well he understands that if that project is ever to come to pass it‚Äôs now or never.     Israel could not exist without massive aid from the U.S. at all.    Bibi‚Äôs problem is that the U.S. grows weaker every day.   So he must get it done soon.I still don‚Äôt think all of the hand wringing by the elites means anything except that they want to fool the normie cons.   Our elites arranged to put a poison substance into 70% of the population that has a pretty high kill rate.  So they don‚Äôt really care about some Palestinian kids being blown to pieces with IDF soldiers making videos of themselves laughing about it.

                I had this very conversation with a normie recently.  I pointed out that the Christian holy sites survived for the almost 2000 years prior to 1947.  Bethlehem is in the West Bank.  A muslim family has the keys to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and is responsible for opening it each morning.  These sites will do just fine without Jews.

                    Lineman:  Don‚Äôt hold your breath.  Someone else brought up the same subject in Bible Study this past Sunday, and the study-leader trotted out ‚Äúbless those who bless you, curse those who curse you.‚Äù  I tried ‚Äì very carefully ‚Äì to add a bit of nuance.  It was obvious many individuals were not onboard with the unquestioning support of Israel, but official doctrine  has not changed at all.

                    It is not so much their Bible as it is their interpretations of Scripture.   They believe many scriptures describe things that are still in the future when, in fact,  they speak of things that have already been fulfilled.

                        That‚Äôs possible, @george 1, but  most mainstream sects think that Jesus has not yet returned, so the creeds speak of ‚ÄúHe will come again‚Ä¶‚Äù Yes, Revelation might have been speaking of the fall of the temple in 70 AD, but it‚Äôs not just Schofield that is the issue then.@Mike, what people are referring to is that Schofield consolidated Darby‚Äôs argument that there would be a Pre-tribulation Rapture, that whole, ‚Äúone is taken, one is left‚Äù thing. Hal Lindsey‚Äôs Late Great Planet Earth is probably free download somewhere, and does a decent job covering it, IIRC. Don‚Äôt remember exactly. Been 40 years or more. Tim LaHaye‚Äôs Left Behind (books or movie adaptations) maybe better, though I have neither read them nor seen the movies. My in-laws recommend them, though.

            What Washington is discovering is that support for Israel is a mile wide and inch deep. Lots of people will say they support Israel, but it is way down the list of things they see as important. More importantly, this support is not based in anything but the assumption that it is socially acceptable position. If that perception changes, the attitudes change with it.

                I think that Jews realize this. They‚Äôve always assumed that we‚Äôre just one economic crisis away from their khaki-wearing neighbors putting them onto trains to camps in Ohio. (I actually had Jews say ‚Äúcamps in Ohio‚Äù to me once.)But this fear will only makes them more paranoid and defensive. It‚Äôs why they make so many states pass laws against criticism. Like in the past, they‚Äôre using the aristocracy to keep down the peasants.However, like in the past, the king and the nobles had no love for the Jews. It was just a useful arrangement. If the peasants ever became a real threat, well, time for the Jews to go.In this case, ‚Äúgoing‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean getting kicked out. It‚Äôs just means that they don‚Äôt get to run US foreign policy unopposed.

                        Robbo, history shows that your people seem unable to stop themselves from pushing too far.  (I‚Äôm going to say ‚Äúyou‚Äù to refer to your people, although I‚Äôm perfectly happy to assume that you‚Äôre a cool guy.)In spite of your small numbers, your energy and intelligence allow you to prosper in a foreign land, to the point of domination.  Again and again.A people like the Chinese would be content with that achievement and not rub the natives‚Äô faces in their loss.But your greater sexual perversion, relative to whites, and your suspicion and hatred of the goyem, compel you to disgust and enrage your host.Just like blacks will burn down the police department that protects them, you guys humiliate and dispossess your host.  In both cases, I wonder, ‚ÄúIs it possible for them to change this pattern with self-awareness?‚Äù  I‚Äôm not hopeful.

                It really is a masterclass having the psychopathic zionist on one hand, and the religous jew on the other (horrified at what is happening in gaza) that balances the messaging. no matter what criticism one might have on the situation, there is a moral/immoral faction in israel that agrees. the confusion makes it hard to completely condemn them. slow clap for the successful narrative control or just plain gaslighting?

            Fine. Let‚Äôs see how much China wants to entangle itself in that mess. They are a very pragmatic people. As for Russia, they‚Äôd probably be a greatly moderating influence on Israel, as they already have good relations with so many Muslim countries, and they don‚Äôt currently have the luxury of being able to shower Israel with billions of dollars.

            Who‚Äôs left for Israel to suck up to in that scenario? Russia maybe, but I think Russia is smarter than that. Israel is like the kid in school no one really likes but who‚Äôs just tolerated as long as it‚Äôs easy yo ignore. Now they‚Äôre not so easy to ignore and they‚Äôve shown their real face to the world and it‚Äôs that of a monster. I think most of the world now is pretty ambivalent about their survival. The only non-Jewish support they have is evangelicals mostly in thos country and they lose more and more of them with every atrocity.

            Who?  I think China, Russia and India would prefer smooth relations with the oil producing states to relations with Israel.  China and India do not have a lot of Jews so no domestic concerns.  Perhaps they would value our most valuable ally‚Äôs spying operations in the US, but I doubt they would value it over oil.  Russia has an influential Jewish population but Putin has mostly leashed them.
