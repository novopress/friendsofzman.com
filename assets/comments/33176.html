        Americans are tired of being told to compete and work hard when their daily reality is that corporate cartels run their lives. The Beatles‚Äô ‚ÄúDay in the Life‚Äù can be rewritten to describe waking up to the Apple alarm, getting out of bed to take a cartel pharmaceutical, ordering junk from Amazon Siri, using a banking cartel credit card to pay, Googling directions to your new job working for a cartel while watching CNN talking about the MIC cartel bombing Syria while you eat processed foods from Archer Daniels. Oh, and your ‚Äúhealth care insurance‚Äù bill is past due‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

        Not only the economic elite but the ethnic elite. The reaction to Oct. 7 and Israel‚Äôs response seems to have shaken the Jewish community. Those black and brown mercenaries brought in to push whites into minority status (all cheered on by corporate America) turned out to be not so sympathetic to the usual suspects.Jews just assumed that they would be on (and lead) Team Victim, but the brown horde puts them on Team Whitey whether they like it or not. As a result, colorblind civic nationalism is now in vogue rather than celebrating identity politics. Also, importing more of these race-noticing immigrants is no longer our best course.When you have the interests of the economic elite, the ethnic elite and the public align, things can change very quickly.

                It‚Äôs tough being a tiny minority trying to rule various tribes. Look at Syria. Being paranoid would be a necessary evolutionary adaptation, as would extreme ethnocentrism.
The Golem will always get out of control because no one like to be ruled by foreigners, especially foreigners who view you as beneath them. I can only hope that the Asians are watching this and saying, no thanks.

            It is telling that the Irish prostitute Starmer publicly acknowledged the Great Replacement. I don‚Äôt believe for a second that he did so on his own. His Jewish handlers directed him. It is clear that at least some are rethinking the strategy whose implementation they inherited from their ancestors. That strategy is rooted in a fundamental truth: they hate us more than they love their own children.

                The richest part of Starmer‚Äôs acknowledgement is placing the blame on the Conservatives. Like all conservatives everywhere, the Tories had adopted Labour‚Äôs open borders policies to prove who the real xenophobes are!

            Not only that, but they imported multiple rival elites. Vivek was the first taste of it. He rightly criticized the unthinking support for the greatest ally. He was spoken to and shut down and changed his tune quickly. He didn‚Äôt change his mind, he just read the room and did the needful to pursue power. If anything, more and more people will brush up against this and it will turn their palpable and legitimate criticism, met with roadblocks and quieting tactics, into a resentment and anger. They will be ambitious and powerful people on the ascent.Stephen Steinlighter‚Äôs big plan to ally with Asians to divide and conquer set 23 years ago may not work out as planned.The dispossessed majority also observed that nobody is sticking up for them. Still nobody is. Time for some strong somebodies to arrive and do that. A massive body of people will roar behind those somebodies. This support, lit by the fire of an existential arousal, will be extremely powerful.Throngs don‚Äôt know it, but they await their Alfred and his Aldermen. However, as soon as he arrives, they will know it and things will get extremely interesting.This rabble we improperly call an, ‚Äúelite‚Äù, have created a massive incoherent mess.The same phenomenon is happening on the foreign front. They sit across the table from men who see people who promote buggery and sterilization of their sons as an enlistment tool. They see that these people have declared war on their own civilization and the people who are the true force in their military. They read these blogs and they know that domestically their hand is weakening.A weakening hand domestically, where they are rightly hated because of the decades of hatred they held for Americans, and a weakened hand on the foreign front as the frontiers of the empire are in turmoil. Who will they summons to help them? The attorney who hates White people and think they all must pay for the late 30s and early 40s ‚Äì even those who fought to end it? That fish lipped twin of Richard Levine who in court makes it overtly racial calling the heroic martyr, ‚Äúthe white man.‚Äù I think they had the sense not to martyr Penny. As tragic as that would have been for him, it would have set the theatre on fire.Can they count on that white man and the others like him dying to display heroism? It isn‚Äôt heroic to lay down your life for those who despise you and spit their venom and spite at you.Yep. Some are waking up to the mess that has been made. There are 180 million Americans they could rally to their banner if they are willing to cross the Rubicon.It grows more interesting by the day.

            ‚ÄúHello, fellow white people!‚Äù  Ehh, nope.
My town does a huge Christmas lighting display, all done by volunteers.  Big tree in the village park, lights, pole trees, garland on the bridge.  The local small hats did a menorah last year, for the first time after some intermittent whining about inclusivity, that looked like it was part of an airplane fuselage.  I wonder if it makes an appearance this year.

                I‚Äôm not so certain it is a total pipe dream. TPTB seemingly have gotten frightened of their Golems and may be looking for a pretext to whack them. It likely would start with Antifa due to the racial element.

You cannot have a multiracial/multiethnic/multireligious high trust society. My grandfather was an engineer for Curtis Wright in Buffalo NY in the late twenties early thirties. When the Great Depression hit they laid off all of the single men first (including my grandfather). Married men had families to feed and the people that ran the company and the laid off single men knew that. There is no reciprocal loyalty between corporations and employees/customers, and there hasn‚Äôt been for fifty plus years.

        It seems to me that the USA is becoming more nakedly a plutocracy (or kleptocracy, if you will). Something more like Yeltsin‚Äôs Russia in the 1990s. I don‚Äôt know how this will play out. The level of dysfunction in the USA seems to be growing and converging, though perhaps slowly, to a third world level. In the third world nothing functions ‚Äî not the roads, not the sewage, not power generation, not reliable food supply, not law and order. Eveything has to be arranged through bakshish and mordida, and family connections. The USA is still far from that point but it does seem to be moving there. I suppose there will be a hiring binge by the oligarchs and CEO for experienced bodyguards.

            Somewhere around here I made the point that Trump is Gorby and Yeltsin rolled into one. He is both the reformer and the agent of chaos due to his erratic temperament and uncertain conditions. I do not think it is an accident that the five richest Americans backed Trump in 2024 and are working with him on the transition.

                The economic elite has been an absentee landlord for far too long. They let their managers run wild as they concentrated on their various pet projects. Now, they‚Äôve discovered that their apartment building is falling apart, and the tenants blame them.
Btw, following your analogy, if Trump is Gorby and Yeltsin, who will be Putin?

                Interesting that Trump gets support all up and down the line. Sure, Richie Rich and Daddy Warbucks support him, but so do far lesser fry. My barber is a Mexican and the vast majority of his clients are also Mexican. Two Saturdays ago I was waiting for my haircut and listening to the usual barbershop conversation. Everybody there avowed their support for Trump. These are working class Mexicans, not captains of industry.

Yes.  Our overlords and psycho-nannies do not understand masculinity, so likewise don‚Äôt understand that Joe and Jose have far more in common with each other, than either does with the wokesters and the fembots.
It is that potential brotherhood-in-masculinity that the regime fears.  Trump is not an icon of this potential, only a faint harbinger.

Ironically, one of the main reasons the Regime despises Trump is he exudes masculinity, faint as it may be. Things are turning back toward the natural order and that cannot be stopped.

We don‚Äôt learn-and some never learn-how dangerous the fairer sex is until we are much older and wiser. I‚Äôll go with the contemporary sage Charlie Sheen on hiring prostitutes. Something to the effect of you don‚Äôt pay them for the sex, you pay them to go away.

This offends and enrages them at the most primal, dualistic level.  The major Prog attack since the Sixties has been the Sisterhood against males.  Women rule.

I have a half arsed theory about such things. Generally speaking (and granting the obvious temporary exceptions and outliers), white people cannot and will not live in a dystopian hellscape the way muds and mystery meat will. They may for short or extended periods‚Ä¶ but eventually they always rebellion and re-establish some kind of civilized order. Ditto for the jews.
If my scholarly theory holds, modern managerialism is going to be a passing fad. All that remains to be seen is whether it destroys itself or is burned to the ground by the angry mob.

        The corporate elite have absolutely no loyalty to anything but money. Not the country, not their local community and probably not even their own family members.  They are corrupt to the core and will do anything for a buck.  This is the same class of people who shut down profitable American manufacturers and shipped them to China  to make an extra buck. They kept doing it even when it became obvious that China would steal the technology and sometimes, even the production line.
Let‚Äôs hope there are many Luigi Mangiones spread throughout the land.

            ‚ÄúThe corporate elite have absolutely no loyalty to anything but money.‚Äù
If that‚Äôs true, then why did so many corporations go woke (anti-traditional white)? Even when some corporations like Bud Light were punished for their wokeness, why did Jaguar release its latest woke campaign?
Why do they adopt DEI policies that likely will lead to less profit? Why don‚Äôt they make movies to profit from all the Christians?
My guess is that many of the economic elite are zealots of a religion of anti-traditional-white, stronger than their greed. (If they lose enough, greed may reassert itself.)

                To begin with, they are different people.  But they also do the DIE stuff for money as well.  They are worried about the corporate governance scores. They are also worried about what their fellow globohomo elite think of them.
Obviously, the woke corporations are somewhat of a different breed than all the manufacturers who sent their production lines to China.
The woke corporations still don‚Äôt have a shred of loyalty to the country, to their communities and likely their families as well.
Here‚Äôs a perfect example of what they do that doesn‚Äôt even involve offshoring:

                Maybe it‚Äôs the usual; follow the money. The corporations saw the Zeitgeist, and followed what‚Äôs been promoted in society. I don‚Äôt believe they knew beforehand how much money they‚Äôd lose. On the other hand, why Jaguar, when they witnessed the Bud Light fiasco? Could be previous contracts or simply sunk cost fallacy, or arrogance. Thinking their customers were more enlightened? However, I‚Äôve long suspected there‚Äôs big money laundering going on. In movies especially, and gaming, why keep making woke material when losing millions? How about more immaterial benefits, loosening regulations for a new factory in case of Jaguar? Jaguars as payment, or lower priced for the Middle Eastern customers, or ability to produce them with less government regulations? It could be hubris and arrogance, but also conniving and money laundering. Or blackmail by the Feds. Maybe they discovered tinkering and would be fined, or their books aren‚Äôt in order. The Feds look away, if the right message is promoted. Look at how the stock market has been manipulated, allowing companies easy, low interest money to buy back stocks. If everything is manipulated with nefarious and greedy intentions, why not their PR and propaganda?

        One of Z‚Äôs more interesting pieces in quite some time.A couple of observations.First, when Coca Cola is to the left of Cornell, of what use is capitalism? After the conclusion of the Cold War, the Left colonized and ultimately conquered capitalism, just as it conquered academia in the 70s and 80s. To support capitalismtout courtis to reify it at your own dire peril. The fact that this Mangioni guy took matters into his own hands decisively proves that some people understand what‚Äôs going on. ‚ÄúFeels So Good‚ÄùSecond, the college sports website from which I earn a crust of bread is peopled overwhelmingly by Grillers, and I can say without doubt that they have not hoisted in the new realities Z outlines. They‚Äôre still all in on ‚Äúcapitalism good/lawlessness bad,‚Äù and are convinced Mangioni is Antifa or Antifa adjacent. A thick-skulled bunch, those Grillers, and they‚Äôve got quite a ways to go before we can count them as allies. Right now, they‚Äôre neutrals between the Leftist and Tradissident camps.

        One might wonder why healthcare became out of reach to begin with, and why it is thus rationed on all levels.  Liz Warren‚Äôs explain-all ‚Äúcorporate greed‚Äù doesn‚Äôt entirely explain how this sorry state came to be, largely within two decades, but immigration does ‚Äì much as it largely explains escalating ‚Äúhousing‚Äù costs. Liz and Bernie never mention the economic effects of immigration.24/7 demand generated from illegals clog every ER in the country ‚Äì their single source of healthcare. The ER is their family doctor for everything from a sore throat to car accidents.  And we all pick up the tab ‚Äì threefold. We pay for their ER bill, we pay for it indirecly in receiving whatever time slices are left over, and then we pay jacked up insurance rates just like with car insurance.There‚Äôs another largely ignored factor which is the government pressuring doctors through state medical associations and also prescription laws dictated through the state DOJs. Doctors are now afraid of falling afoul of these laws (even by accident) and now practice in more of a defensive fashion to protect their licenses from state scrutiny and harassment.It didn‚Äôt HAVE to be this way ‚Äì Obama could have traded immigration for expanded Medicare coverage, lowering age limits a little bit every year, for example. Instead, we got the best of both worlds for insurance companies AND immigrants, screwing over the middle.

        There are bigger problems in America than our overpriced health care, but most of the problems stem from a corrupt, alien elite who see the people as little more than economic animals to be milked and fleeced.In this sense, the killing did strike at the source of the bigger problems driven by the elites:  Mass immigration, corporations undermining the foundations of society, gross ‚Äì obscene differences in wealth:  Folks are sleeping under bridges, and the elites are buying their third, or fourth multi-million dollar mansion.  Who needs more than two mansions?This guy could be Pretty Boy Floyd for the 21st century.

        It‚Äôs not entirely clear to me that this Luigi (very cute) of the wealthy is anything more than a well to do patsy who needed some cash to survive. If that theory is correct, we can expect his with suicide via toilet paper (and without security cameras) any day now.The only real part seems to the murder.  I don‚Äôt think 26 year old men write 3 page handwritten* manifestos and then don‚Äôt leave them with the body. I don‚Äôt think that 26 year old men who are supposedly brilliant keep all the evidence on their person, just be found at McDonald‚Äôs just one state over in time for what used to be the Monday evening news. I don‚Äôt think they throw away backpacks in central park only to retain all the evidence. I don‚Äôt think they leave behind Starbucks and burner phones for people find them conveniently.A possible motive of the other unknown and probably elite murderer is the silence of the CEO along with all the other c-suite executives on any number of topics financially damaging. We need the media coverage to get their silence.That said, I agree with your sense of a play, which is maybe what inspired the general tone of this article. I also agree that the surprise for the elites and media is that everyone is done with the play. The lefties are at giggles about a CEO down. There are few older conservatives trying to make this about rule of law, but our God given freedom to pay for insurance that fails us when we need it most is muted. There‚Äôs just not a whole lot of outrage or interest or this time.*If the average person over 40 will naturally type anything as faster and easier, do we really think a 26 old is going to bother with a task that might take at least an hour or two for him in very awkward manner?

            I guess I‚Äôve been reading and commenting here waay too long, but we tend to think a bit alike.Whereas I called the ‚Äúhit‚Äù non-professional and got that right, I really look at this whole incident with another perspective than main stream.This is an amazing tracking and rundown of the ‚Äúsuspect‚Äù.  Too amazing, almost unbelievable.  Should we believe that we live in a complete police surveillance State and nothing goes on that isn‚Äôt recorded and that any matter of importance to the police can be immediately tracked back to the perpetrator?  Or as mentioned, should we believe that the perpetrator is so stupid as to be caught after an amazing bit of detection by a minimum wage flunky at McDonalds with all the evidence needed for a swift and convincing prosecution‚Äîhe retains his weapon, his ‚Äúmanifesto, etc.The whole thing smells.

                While I generally agree with your comment, I think that in dense urban zones almost everything is indeed recorded.  Not actively monitored of course, but cameras are ubiquitous.  This is largely thanks to a reasonable fear of crime ‚Äì we‚Äôve done it to ourselves.

                OTOH, if you want to assassinate somebody, you shouldn‚Äôt do it in the middle of the day and in the middle of a busy street in a large city. The fact that the hit was done this way, could mean two things ‚Äì either the perpetrator didn‚Äôt think this through (or didn‚Äôt care) or it‚Äôs all a show.

                Finding him with the murder weapon and his manifesto in his bag after an anonymous tip in a McDonalds sounds a lot like finding one of the 9/11 hijackers passports on the sidewalk a block from the towers. The guy seemed reasonably smart. Smart enough to know not to have incriminating evidence on him and to change clothes and ditch the mask after he got out of the immediate area. Lots of places have solar-generated compactor trash cans, especially on college campuses.If this truly is the guy, the slightly more believable explanation is that they tracked him down using the various clandestine internet-of-things assets at their disposal and did ‚Äúsimultaneous discovery‚Äù (I forget what the term is called) to have somebody file an anonymous tip even though they knew exactly where he was. This would keep them from having to explain skynet to the hoi polloi (although one would think they might want people to know about it to assure other would-be assassins how futile evasion is) and would also prevent a defense from accusing them of getting fruit from a poison tree if the means they used to track him down weren‚Äôt strictly legal. I‚Äôd say that ship has sailed, though, considering the Boston PD and the Feds were going door to door harassing everybody who googled ‚Äúpressure cooker‚Äù in 2013.Or this could all be kabuki theater and the guy they caught is a willing or unwilling stooge who will be ‚ÄúEpsteined‚Äù in his cell whether that means they whack him or they ferry him off to never neverland to enjoy a quiet retirement.

                    ‚ÄúParallel construction.‚Äù Cops launder illegally obtained evidence by making up a legal way theymighthave found it and pretending that‚Äôs what happened. The entire judicial system approves. There‚Äôs no such thing as an unlawful arrest/prosecution. (Of course there arepeoplewho can‚Äôt be arrested or prosecuted.)The McDonalds story is in-your-face bullshit, as all such stories are now, because they‚Äôre made up by sadistic children. Why does a misbehaving kid always lie so implausibly? Typically it‚Äôs because he has no idea of‚Äîno possible access to‚Äîthe adult mind that would judge his lie. It‚Äôs real to him. If he says it, everyone will see it.In some cases he knows the parent can‚Äôt punish him. Daddy‚Äôs just been to family court. He‚Äôs down two cars and a house.With just one word‚Ä¶In this analogy, both. That‚Äôs howfreethe regime feels. Rightly so.

        Imagine a guy like Luigi showing up at the J6 protests, and imagine he‚Äôs not a lone wolf but there are 20-30 just like him‚Ä¶I‚Äôve said for a long time that the over-the-top response to J6 was straight up fear born from the knowledge that THEY GOT LUCKY. Lucky that 99.9% of the protesters went home before dark, and none were really violent.We live in a very open and vulnerable society. Countless county health department employees are very, very, lucky that people played along with the COVID charade. It‚Äôs not hard to find where those people live and work for a business owner whose livelihood was destroy by paid ‚Äúmission essential‚Äù bureaucrats. Ditto various ‚ÄúLawfare‚Äù operatives. We saw in Butler, PA how easy it is to get in close whether you think the USSS and local cops were intentionally incompetent or unwittingly so.If the elites in this country have second cousins, there you will find Luigi Mangione. He‚Äôs very nearly one of them, yet he wants them dead. That has to be terrifying once you realize how many people are not your cousins but want you dead. That‚Äôs a lot of bullets, and your house has maybe 5‚Äù of siding and drywall. And zero when out at the grocery store or walking out of the gym.Vox fired that Lorenz chick who got fired from WaPost. They fired her for saying the quiet part out loud. She‚Äôs a dirtbag, but she probably is saying out loud what easily 1,000,000 people thought last week:‚ÄùGee. What a shame. Couldn‚Äôt have happened to a nicer guy‚Ä¶üôÑ.‚ÄùHe didn‚Äôt deserve death. Few do. But they keep fu$king with peoples lives and livelihoods, and we‚Äôre going to see a lot more of this.What do they do if a left wing New York jury acquits him?

            Whether he deserved death is debatable. In normal times when madness was quarantined rather than normalized, when civilization rather than savagery was the rule, you could put up with the odd dirtbag CEO. But by the thunderous balls of Zeus, when civilization hangs on by a thread, one can argue the taproot of that civilization must be refreshed by the blood of those who are poisoning it.

                I don‚Äôt know.  By that logic should we kill all the people who went along with the covid stuff?  How about the fat, lazy, slobs who are 100lbs overweight clogging up the healthcare system making it harder for me to get in to the doctor and driving prices through the roof because they‚Äôre too fricking lazy to just. stop. eating. and go for a walk every night.Lots of people talking about the physique of white people in football stadiums in the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs compared to the shirtless beluga white whales there today.

                        On this we agree.  Making them ‚Äúessential‚Äù with full pay made them far too powerful.  If you have the power to lock down businesses en masse, you should forfeit pay and benefits until the order is lifted.  And no back pay.
Like I wrote on Monday, those county health dept workers are lucky that business owners and workers didn‚Äôt show up at their homes to ‚Äúdeal with the problem‚Äù violently.

He is a young, good looking rich kid.¬†He was given a life that most people would envy.¬†How likely is it that he risked throwing this away to draw attention to a problem that didn‚Äôt affect him?
It‚Äôs not impossible that he wanted to be an avenger for the masses.¬†That feeling can be pretty intoxicating, especially for the young.  Or is there a larger play afoot?

        I am skeptical that the economic elite have really gotten religion and are on our side now.  Capitalists are profit-driven creatures and maximize profit by minimizing costs. Labor is typically the biggest cost in a business, so capitalists favor any policy that drives down the cost of labor. That means outsourcing to cheap labor countries and importing non-white labor to do the work that is still done here. That is economic and cultural poison for the American working class but ambrosia for the capitalists. They may have gotten a little janky with the woke stuff they helped promote but are they really going to give up the gravy train the current economic order has created for them? Trump is talking about increasing legal immigration, which should answer that question.

            It depends. Military sectors can see mass third world immigration squeezing out all spending but social welfare, so they are on our side. No one else but the feds will fund them. Same with Musk.And for the Silicon Valley types, Marc Andreesen noted in Spring they had a meeting with the Biden Admin. They were told not to work on AI as only 2/3 firms would be allowed to do so and would do so under direct government control and supervision. Even worse with crypto. Andreesen noted more than 30 crypto or ai funders or ceo‚Äôs debanked by Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs CFPB.So you had government bureaucrats deciding they are the power; and simply pushed the SV types mostly to Trump. [Same thing happened to the auto workers union, and auto makers].

            One of the interesting things I learned came from watching a certain subset of youtube that engages in ‚Äúcan you believe what Disney is doing now to ruin our childhood entertainment?‚Äù videos. They pointed out something that floored me when an private party was mulling over buying out Disney. Disney had almost no operational capital. Its warchest was in the millions, not the tens of millions. While entertainment is an investment-driven enterprise, you‚Äôd figure they‚Äôd have a lot of cash from their parks and merchandise. A lot of companies seem to be in this position where they have almost no capital for expansion and development. And so they go to investors like Blackrock with their pockets out. Blackrock lends on condition that they engage in DEI/ESG practices in their business. The ‚Äúwoke‚Äù stuff was a requirement for a lot of companies to deliver growth (the only thing the board and shareholders care about anymore).

                Which is why you should never bailout wall street, and also why 401ks should not exist. I mean how can you say no to a bailout when they have a gun to your families head? Many of them defaulted on pension promises in the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs and i‚Äôm 110% certain your 401k will at least soft default.(the only thing the board and shareholders care about anymore)They care about power, the system has consolidated so much that corporations basically run everything now anyways.

                Good points. I posted this earlier, but applies to your remarks too; It‚Äôs always, follow the money. The corporations saw the Zeitgeist, and followed what‚Äôs been promoted. I don‚Äôt believe they knew beforehand how much money they‚Äôd lose. On the other hand, why Jaguar, when they witnessed the Bud Light fiasco? Could be previous contracts or simply sunk cost fallacy, or arrogance. Thinking their customers were more enlightened? However, I‚Äôve long suspected there‚Äôs big money laundering going on. In movies especially, and gaming, why keep making woke material when losing millions? How about more immaterial benefits, loosening regulations for a new factory in case of Jaguar? Jaguars as payment, or lower priced for the Middle Eastern customers, or ability to produce them with less government regulations? It could be hubris and arrogance, but also conniving and money laundering. Or blackmail by the Feds. Maybe they discovered tinkering and would be fined, or their books aren‚Äôt in order. The Feds look away, if the right message is promoted. Look at how the stock market has been manipulated, allowing companies easy, low interest money to buy back stocks. If everything is manipulated with nefarious and greedy intentions, why not their PR and propaganda?

                    It‚Äôs not just the money, they‚Äôre trying to destroy any understanding on why the current system is good.

        ‚ÄúThis case also reveals that the old American love of the outlaw is still there, buried under the piles of corporate slop.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs why one of the talking points of the election had no effect: the point that Trump was ‚Äúa convicted felon‚Äù.  You could hear the vituperation as the pundits hissed and spat that expression at the electorate.  When it didn‚Äôt work to scare them from supporting Trump, it was used to shame them for doing so.  It was specifically designed to work on someone like me, a woman who‚Äôs always been a law-and-order conservative. But it failed. Instead, every time I heard those words I mentally flashed an image of The Outlaw Josie Wales, and we all know who we‚Äôre supposed to root for in that movie.

        History will record Luigi via that iconic image in a hoodie with a genuine smile on his face. And the execution was artistry, so this could become folklore like the OK Corral. Most importantly, it was unexpected in most respects. Daniel Penny rescued 30 old subway riders from a deranged crack addict, and is now regarded as a hero. If United Healthcare now changes its policy of rejecting 34% of claims, what does that say about Luigi‚Äôs contribution to society?

        What I find interesting is why didn‚Äôt any of his family members come forward if he was so easy to spot by a random observer in a MacDonalds? Naming your son ‚ÄúLuigi‚Äù in deference to your origins definitely played a role IMHO, i.e., blood is still thicker than water among certain ‚Äúwhite‚Äù Americans. Although Italians are assimilable in the grand scheme of American identity, what was a flair for pride in one‚Äôs origins over this last generation may become less palatable going forward. Some Shitaviouses of the new generation may even become Steves with a thought to their long-term survival.In any event, if Trump doesn‚Äôt address the racket known as health-care insurance in this country, among others, that‚Äôs just one of the many powder kegs in the old collapsing barn of the American system that‚Äôs primed to go off. I hope to see at the least a reclassification of the ‚Äúhealth-care‚Äù sector including Big Pharma to a quiet low-growth investment environment as effective regulation kicks in.The Zeitgeist appears to be rapidly evolving and if change doesn‚Äôt rapidly happen across a broad front, including at colleges and universities, non-profits, U.S. foreign policy, the military, the revolving-door of industry capture, Congressional privileges, election reform, border security, Corporate hiring practices, the law courts, magic dirt and dual citizenship, and enforcement of laws that are already on the books, TO NAME JUST A FEW, then it‚Äôs not enough. And by enough, I mean just barely to hold this shitshow together for a few more generations. Because it‚Äôs not going to be a return to an imagined Leave it to Beaver America among young white males of the Heritage population.

        The Healthcare CEO‚Äôs Murder Is Yet Another Fake
https://stateofthenation.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Healthcare-CEO-Assassination.pdf
I have a sneaking suspicion Miles Mathis might be right about this one also.

            Considering the surfeit of surveillance cameras in NYC, it‚Äôs possible and even plausible that the ‚Äúmurder‚Äù would be caught on one. But it is nevertheless remarkable that it wasperfectlyin frame. Also remarkable that the footage was released to the publicimmediately, even though it provided nothing helpful regarding the killer‚Äôs face.Then, days later, the guy is found at a McDonald‚Äôswith the murder weapon still on him. But even more ridiculous, (I am quoting AP here), in possession of ‚Äúwritings critical of the healthcare industry.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know about you, but that‚Äôs always the kind of thing I carry with me when I go to eat at McDonald‚Äôs.

                I am skeptical about his arrest.¬†Even with that picture of him smiling, he was nondescript enough that I doubt anyone would have later linked him to the videos.¬†It seems unlikely that a MacDonalds‚Äô employee would have recognized him and called the FBI.¬†Not impossible, just implausible.
Is this drama a part of a larger orchestrated scheme?  One might guess that this would be a play to motivate gun control, but the lack of calls from the media for that is also surprising.

                    Based on the narrative/zeitgeist, some kind of health insurance reform would appear to be the most likely angle, if there is an angle.

                        Not really one for so called reform when one of the major reasons for the dysfunction is government regulation and policy in the first place.in any event, reform will come in the guise of socialized, ‚Äúfree‚Äù medicine as we‚Äôve seen in other Western countries with even more government control and regulation.  At that point nothing will change‚Äîexcept when, and if, you do get ‚Äútreated‚Äù you‚Äôll not pay.  Then the hew and cry will be for more resources as we‚Äôve seen all over the world.Look for the same long emergency room waits, the same infinite time to see a family doctor and even longer wait times for any specialist.  Anything that has no ‚Äúcost‚Äù is valueless and therefore subject to over use by those not paying, and to the detriment of those paying.

                        Think of the guy as a nut living out a fantasy story he‚Äôs planned out in his mind in intense detail. The plot of the story needed to move forward, and so he made himself visible and carried what he needed with him to ensure everyone knew they had the right guy.The fantasy story isn‚Äôt nearly as cool if he just walks into Brooklyn 99 and turns himself in. The story had a plan, a murder, a daring escape, taunting of law enforcement (various photos and clues he left behind), an ‚Äúon the lamb‚Äù chapter, and then our hero ‚Äúby complete chance and accident‚Äù gets noticed by a small town McD‚Äôs employee. And he just so happens to be carrying evidence critical to the survival of billions, but is captured before he can make it all public and bring the system down.The dude is living out a fan fiction novel irl. This thing has a plot, tone, theme, setting(s), conflict, characterization and the POV of a 3rd party (media) narrator.He got ‚Äúcaught‚Äù because he needed to advance the plot which culminates Act II.Act III: Arrest and public trial in which he attempts to represent himself and/or the lawyers declare him unfit for trial.  His manifesto gets published making him a Robin Hood hero.  And a martyr.

                It‚Äôs also quite plausible that he‚Äôs a complete nut. And like a lot of complete nuts, he‚Äôs highly intelligent, and planned the whole thing out in precise detail, up to and through his amazing escape on the streets of the city.Then, a week later, low on cash and still uncaught while wandering around Altoona, PA, he had no way to get on to the next chapter of his mental fantasy which was his capture and ‚Äústicking it to the man‚Äù in court. So, he makes it obvious who he is while in a public place. Maybe smiles for the McD clerk in a way that reminds that person of the photo that was released‚Ä¶I saw some news today that he was having outbursts at the media. The nut job dude has turned to the next chapter of his weird story where he expected he‚Äôd be a week ago. But police turned out to be fairly hapless and his family clearly had no intention of pointing out, ‚ÄúHey, we think that‚Äôs our kid/brother/cousin/etc.‚ÄùSo he turned himself in because the plot needed to move forward, but in a way that made it look like chance or fate.  Lots of people have weird fantasies like that.  He just decided to act his out irl.

            Most of us on this side of the divide know the press always lies even when they don‚Äôt need to do so. However, even the DR will accept what the Media is writing and saying about this. Something about the (supposed) murder (maybe all of it) has to be a lie. Maybe all of it is a lie.

        ‚ÄúWhile it is unlikely that he is ‚Äúour guy‚Äù, he is clearly a young man who escaped the old political paradigm.‚ÄùClassificatory labels like ‚Äòright‚Äô, ‚Äòleft‚Äô, ‚Äòconservative‚Äô, and ‚Äòliberal‚Äô change meaning over time. They are transient descriptors of personal identity and mutual self-interest.Transitioning to a new order takes two kinds of individuals, destroyers and (re)builders. Mangione is in the former category. Whatever other labels one might apply to him, he sacrificed his life to strike a blow against evil.Most of our corporate administrators like Brian Thompson and the alien internationalist rulers who organize the legal and moral framework in which the administrators operate are barbarians who wear nice suits to camouflage their true nature. They are not going to stop being evil temporarily until they have skin in the game. Now they do. The internationalists are never going to stop being evil permanently.While immoral drones like Thompson might be constrained by restructuring the incentive environments in which they operate, the internationalists for whom the drones work can only be constraining by expelling them somewhere else. It is easier to find solutions to civilizational problems in direct proportion to civilizational homogeneity.A ‚Äònot guilty‚Äô vote by Mangione‚Äôs jury would solidify the message he sent. All empires die. If the ad hoc provincial ersatz merchant ruling class Pres. Trump has cobbled together around mutual self-interest to repair the dying Global American Empire wants to be more than a footnote in the dustbin of history, they will be thinking about making deep repairs to the social, economic, and political fabric of the empire. However, I am sure they are not. They want to fix things just enough to keep the grift going one more generation.

        Mangione is giving me some old south-central Italian anarchist vibes. Zman is right when noticing the departure from the standard Antifa schema (Germany-derived). In fact, it begs a parallel with the Wall Street bombings which were a cold-shower for the WASP elite. Perhaps with the de-WASPing of America we‚Äôre going to see all of the old modes of thinking go out of the window. Time to dust off the political Mediterranean classics, Southern-European thought is going to be so back.Libro e moschetto ‚Äì fascista perfettoAs the great Southern bard observed, outlaws touch the ladies somewhere deep down in their soul.That‚Äôs putting it very gentlemanly.

            Mangione‚Äôs family at least was wealthier than the CEO. The latter grew up in working class poverty and attended some no name school. The former went to a $40,000 a year prep school and UPenn.

                Uh, the United Healthcare CEO may have attended a public high school, but he attended the University of Iowa and obtained a Bachelor‚Äôs in Business focused on accounting. UofI is a state flagship university, which is not quite no name.
In a weird parallel with his assassin, he was also the valedictorian of his class and college.

        I think it possible he might be a patsy. Remember, when the story first broke, the tall foreheads in law enforcement said the perp was armed and did the deed with a super rare, exotic bolt action veterinarian pistol used to euthanize farm animals. It was obvious  to even non-gunnies he was using a generic automatic pistol.And Lo and Behold ‚Äì these mighty paragons and icons of modern law enforcement catch the perfect perp in less than a couple days.Pull my other finger fellas. We‚Äôll know the truth of it soon enough I suppose. If he dies n prison‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs likely the real killer, or an inconvenient hireling.

        I think this is hilarious. We are living in a simulated comedy show. A very terrifying, cruel and unusual one, but that just makes it way more funny to be honest. Cheeto man, regime appointed  assasins, e-thots, AI and UFOs are just the last few months big topics. The simulation recycles them faster each year. C‚Äômon who here is taking life seriously anymore? Sure, go have family dinners try to be a good man etc. but I don‚Äôt care anymore. Whatever happens in 2025, I‚Äôll be laughing all the way through till that eternal void swallows me whole.

        Interesting take, but mine is somewhat different. Mangione is not a Cloud but he comes from an extremely wealthy, Cloud-adjacent family. He is an illustration of a relatively recent phenomenon in American terms, which is the uber rich malignant narcissist. These types think they are exempt from punishment for any crime that gives them the selfie rush, or, as you put it, the attraction of minor celebrity. They are not exempt, though, and conflate themselves with actual Clouds in this regard.Interestingly, the fired psycho bitch ‚Äújournalist‚Äù Taylor Lorenz has been outed as a Mangione follower and has gotten herself into hot water by praising him prior to that revelation. She formerly was famous for punching down and doxing working-class people in her role as an alleged reporter for the Washington Post. And like Mangione, she also comes from an extremely privileged and well-heeled background. And if you look closely enough, Antifa/Black Bloc types also have similar privileged backgrounds. Their common goal is the thrill of infamy and a belief they can get by with anything, which happens quite a bit. Antifa is the very definition of malignant narcissism.We saw this taking shape during the first Trump term. An extremely egregious example was a film that featured Mangione/Lorenz types literally hunting MAGA folks. The heroine was one of the quarries who revealed herself to be sympatico with her hunters‚Äô self-proclaimed enlightenment. The other victims, of course, deserved it.Yes, yes, the CEO killed here was filthy rich and his company is execrable, but he came from a farm background and this surely was known to Mangione. Even if that was not the case, Mangione thought he could murder the guy in cold blood without consequence.It is interesting this happens at this time. The Clouds seem to have decided to stomp on their Golems out of fear, and Mangione may be may into an example. As you point out, the zeitgeist has changed, but the Clouds are quite aware of it, so expect this malignant example to be increasingly demonized in their propaganda outlets. Granted, it may not be enough, but that‚Äôs generally not the way to bet.I agree with you about the general shift, though, and also find it fascinating.

            I had a similar observation calling them ‚Äúcousins‚Äù.  Cloud-adjacent has a nice ring to it.Assuming Mangione is the guy, the fact that he was found at a McD‚Äôs in Altoona means he was just wandering around after the murder.  He expected to be caught and left clues to help.  But he only had a little bit of pocket money which had probably started to run out.  It was taking too long and he got tired of waiting because Act III of his fantasy is the game and notoriety and ‚ÄúRobin Hood‚Äù story line.  So he makes himself very visible and brings proof that only the criminal could possess.

                Mangione definitely wanted to be caught. The guy is a typical malignant narcissist, a type that now has a huge representation in the upper classes. They have enough money to buy more than fifteen minutes, too, although he added to his allotment on the relative cheap (buses, really?). These are the types who are always the first killed after a successful revolution they worked hard to make possible, understandably so to everyone but them. The fear Mangione has generated among the Clouds is quite useful and to be applauded, but people need to be realistic about what a loathsome bastard he is. Two competing thoughts and all..,*eta: Recall that The Guardian after all these many years removed Bin Laden‚Äôs manifesto from its website after October 7th. Look for attempts to squelch this guy‚Äôs as well.

                    ‚ÄúThe fear Mangione has generated among the Clouds is quite useful and to be applauded, but people need to be realistic about what a loathsome bastard he is.‚ÄùAgree. He‚Äôs a narcissist. A LOT of people have suffered FAR worse injuries that his back surgery that made his dick limp, with far less in the way of financial and educational resources.Imagine being some poor bastardconscriptedto go to Vietnam and getting both your legs and your dick blown off. And then reading the Pentagon Papers when you got back.A guy like that would have had arealreason to shoot the people responsible.This is one of the main lessons of Christianity. Whatever bad things have legitimately happened to you, they‚Äôre almost certainly not as bad as getting nailed to a cross and having the soldiers mock you and spit on you as you‚Äôre dying. You will never be able to get back at the bastards who did it to you, and even if you could it wouldn‚Äôt undo the damage they‚Äôve done.

        A bit off topic, but not totally‚Ä¶. Can Daniel Penny be recharged with manslaughter?  He was neither convicted nor acquitted of this charge.  It was withdrawn by the prosecution while the jury was deliberating.  I just don‚Äôt know how far double jeopardy protection goes.  Same act, different charge.  Double jeopardy protection has been weakened for decades.  Some guy in the 80s was charged 3 times for the same murder, two of which ended in acquittals. They finally got him in some military court.He is probably thanking the good Lord that Kamala didn‚Äôt win, otherwise he could be facing federal charges.

In a civil suit, I think he might have more room to present evidence that the other dude was nuts.  In fact, he should counter-sue the family for allowing an obviously deranged family member to ride the NYC subways unsupervised.

        Some years back, Zman had a good podcast about the spate of bombings and assassinations at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries.
I wonder if he considers this murder to be a hint for return of those times.

        Luigi Mangione is no one‚Äôs idea of a hero and anyone who finds him praiseworthy should take a close look at themselves in the mirror.  He crept up on a guy with a suppressed weapon and shot him in the back.  That makes him the worst type of coward and because of his degenerate attitude a family is out a husband and father.This wasn‚Äôt exactly Hamilton vs Burr or Marshall Dillon facing down a bad guy, it was a morally bankrupt and blackened soul carrying out a thoroughly disgusting deed and it needs to be recognized as such.  There is no way this nation recovers any sense of right vs wrong or indeed, justice, since that word is much in vogue these days.

                The executive was a family man without priviledge who worked his way high up the ladder into a corporation we have come to realize is, as are they all,  noxious to the public. His killer is a boy of great privilege who knows nothing of humility and, he believes, everything of the world.

                    I don‚Äôt care about privilege one way or the other. I care about the elite class, how they annihilated America and are well into the process of dismantling Western civilization. They must be stopped, and all the Buckleyite badinage and Republican electoral politics haven‚Äôt accomplished sweet Fatty Arbuckle. It may well be time to escalate and Mangione did just that.

                        You stop them by standing up to them and refusing their dictates. You don‚Äôt stop them by cowardly assassinations. Lincoln was shot from behind too and it had the effect of making the state stronger. Suppressors are under consideration for being taken off the NFA 34 list and one of their wind up toys caps a guy in the back with a suppressed weapon (that may or many not have been printed). That not only isn‚Äôt the thing to do it‚Äôs playing right into big brother‚Äôs hands.Awfully convenient timing there, plus the praise for Mangione‚Äôs heinous act from certain quarters just fuels the gun grabbers. That doesn‚Äôt accomplish Jack, and Jack left town.

                Indeed. I find Mangione reprehensible, a malignant narcissist from the wannabe upper-est class, loathsome in all respects, but putting the/his Cloud overlords into a panic makes him useful. The bone of Woke thrown to take the hounds off the trail in the wake of Occupy Wall Street has run its course. Economics, second only to nature, wins more often than Africa. Adding to their fear was his use of a ghost gun. Mangione very well may have had a stash of IEDs or worse. We would never hear about it, of course, but our masters certainly would. The ubiquitous surveillance state does have limits, and that seems not to have been fully appreciated. It will be interesting to see the response. Those of late have been rather impotent and desperate. Yes, they are close, but this may be as close as they ever get.

                    Useful in what way?  Do you actually think reform is coming?  Based on history it gets crazier and crazier because reform doesn‚Äôt come.  Not the other way around.  Democrats will not give up healthcare, which is why i find all this funny.  Healthcare is a democrat run racket, and would have failed years ago without immense government support, and uh even .gov has a limited balance sheet, even though they seem to think they don‚Äôt.  It‚Äôs like magic, ya just gotta believe!  Obamacare wasn‚Äôt about helping joe schmoe, it was a bailout of the insurance industry.  Just like taking rates to 0% for a decade was a further bailout of the stock market, you want any return you gotta chase it baby!

        The economic elite are smarter than their paid Toadies, the politicians. Buried deep within the torso of the rich, where a heart should be, is a keenly sniffing nose for survival. The rich and powerful remember the lessons of the French and Russian Revolutions. They know there could be a real American revolution in the 21st Century and they are, if not afraid, at least concerned.The rich, responding to the new populist movement, will begin deploying their resources in the media and elsewhere to shape a new narrative. The narrative? Why, how cute and cuddly the dominant rich are, in so many terms. If Warren Buffett is the Oracle of Omaha and Elon Musk is the savior of the environment, expect their personal qualities to be laudedhard.‚Äî Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)
