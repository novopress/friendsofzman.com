        I once went out with a woman who lived next door to two lesbians. Unhappy lesbians? My goodness, you could hear them screaming at each other through the walls.
Usually the screams was along the lines of “You f***ing bitch! You were looking at that woman in the pub!”
“You  “f***ing cow! You were sat nearer her than me!”
So it went on through the late evening which meant I guess there was a lot of unhappy looking going on, though I doubt if these two women got many looks back from anyone much.
