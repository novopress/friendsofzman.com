        I have always found writing in English to be much easier than writing in German. English is much more flexible so where you place nouns, verbs, adverbs, etc. still works even if the sentence isn‚Äôt quite perfect. German is not so forgiving and even well educated people still find the grammar a bit of a challenge when writing. It‚Äôs always a challenge translating in my head since I naturally think in German first and then write in English. It‚Äôs probably how AI works to some degree.But back to your point on AI, if what I have heard spoken in English from people under the age of 40 is any reflection of what AI is producing, Shakespeare must be spinning in his grave.A quick Google search states ‚ÄúMost adult native test-takers have a vocabulary range of about 20,000-35,000 words.‚Äù However after a recent trip to the US I think that‚Äôs being rather generous. I would put range substantially lower for anyone under 30 at closer to 15,000-20,000 or possibly less. Considering few people under the age 40 read serious literature these days it‚Äôs no surprise their verbal and grammatical skills are so poor.Given AI has full access to the entire English language and understands now grammar is supposed to work (depending on who‚Äôs writing the rules) those who lack sufficient verbal and grammar skills can use AI to hide just how ignorant and poorly read they really are. A few articles on college student writing skills quickly points to the frustration professors are having since they can‚Äôt stop their students from using AI.While you may be able to hide your lack of writing skills with AI, the ability to think and put those thoughts onto paper is another story which will probably not end well for future generations.

            That‚Äôs good to know, Karl.I speak German (lived over there for 5 years), and in my job, I did need to use some written German (such as emails; nothing more formal than that).And even writing emails, at the peak of my fluency, living in the country, was a challenge.I think it‚Äôs a combination of the verb tenses, combined with the three different articles.Plus German writing isvastlymore formal compared to spoken German.I‚Äôd say the gulf between spoken English and formal written English, as compared to the gulf between spoken vs. written German, is much smaller.Maybe that‚Äôs because, though, English has become the lingua franca of the planet, so there are many more people to butcher and magle it.

                I think it was Voltaire who wrote that it took a month to be fluent in Italian, a year to learn French and a lifetime to speak German poorly.
The best I could do after a few weeks of college German (dropped) and subsequent visits:‚ÄúIch bin dumb.  Neine spreche se Deutsche gut.‚Äù (I am dumb.  I don‚Äôt speak German well)
Though frankly, the follow up of ‚ÄúEine bier, bitte‚Äù (A beer please) and ‚ÄúDu bist schoene‚Äù (You are pretty) was all I every REALLY needed.

                    A clip of an interview with author Jorge Luis Borges from Firing Line in the 1970s has been floating around social media for at least a couple years. In it he praises English for both great descriptive depth and precision as well as ease of use and adaptability, which he attributes to its combined Latinate and Germanic registers.

                The only foreign languages I have studied are German and Norwegian. One of the things that strikes you immediately is that Norwegian word order is much more similar to English than German. My English-speaking brain was always tortured attempting to translate German sentences into English word order. On the other hand, I found German easier to pronounce. Norwegian vowel sounds differ more from English than do German vowels and the Norwegians also use a tonal system that makes the language somewhat singsongy sounding to English-speaking ears. It is difficult to imitate and my Norwegian relatives commented that they could understand me but my Norwegian was somewhat Danish-sounding (the Danes don‚Äôt have the same tonal system).

                English has become the lingua franca of the planet,If history had turned out differently, perhaps more of the world would speak German. And who knows, it might have been a better world‚Ä¶As the resident Nietzsche booster, or at least one with legitimate claim to the throne, I would share this:¬†I recall reading in, perhaps one of his critics, that Nietzsche actually ‚Äúimproved‚Äô German in the sense that he attempted to innovate in his writings to be more in the style of other major languages of his day, primarily English I would assume.¬†I know virtually no German beyond ‚ÄúNochmal bier, bitte‚Äù, so all I‚Äôve read of his work is in English translation. Even in English and with his alleged modernization, it‚Äôs still very complex reading. The tendency to prolixity was not confined to Germany of course. I‚Äôve attempted to read David Hume and for Christ‚Äôs sake, how can anyone write a whole page and it all seems to be one sentence.¬†In fact, I was using a study guide that attempted to condense and paraphrase Hume‚Äôs prose, and even the paraphrase was a challenge to follow.Or perhaps my reading skills are simply sub-par.

You‚Äôre still being rather generous. It‚Äôs interesting, nay, amazing, how one can get by in the USA with a vocabulary of maybe not more than three thousand words. And this applies across the socio-economic continuum.

                Is that because they‚Äôre trying to read his original texts which of course would reflect German as it was a couple hundred years ago. By contrast, I suppose the English translations are into modern English. Perhaps it‚Äôs something like us trying to read the Federalist Papers.

            How I wish I had studied German!  My middle school Spanish has been useful only in conjunction with my bit of college Latin ‚Äì when translating old Italian records.  And myRussian and Bulgarian served their purposes when needed, but are now sadly poorly remembered due to the distance of time and lack of use.  As an English major (and one who still makes her own share of mistakes) I love the flexible word order, lack of gender and case endings, and the rich German/Latin/Greek vocabulary.  But then I‚Äôve always read a lot, even when I was stumped by the word ‚Äúeyeglasses‚Äù at age six.  I do my best to avoid modern black/mestizo slang, although I admit the utility of the term ‚Äúthot‚Äù (‚Äúslore‚Äù just doesn‚Äôt have the same impact for me).  I always tried to learn enough of the local language to say the important local phrases (please, thank you, where is/how much is ‚Äòx‚Äô, pretty) so I know tiny bits of Greek and Turkish, as well as lots of British English.  Always enjoy your erudite comments, Karl.

            The most urgent crisis in the entire Anglosphere right now is getting 4chan back online.It‚Äôs shocking how much True Information vanished from our radar the very moment that 4chan &amp; /pol/ went down.Suddenly we‚Äôre in a complete information vacuum.With Anglin having called it quits, there are currently no trustworthy information sources anywhere in the entire internet [at least that I‚Äôm aware of].We lost bajillions of terrabytes of information when 4chan &amp; /pol/ were hacked.I have no idea where to get trustworthy information anymore.There‚Äôs only so much that Tucker can do all by himself [and even Tucker‚Äôs expos√©s are often filmed months or years after the fact]./pol/ was a constant stream of Truth Speak, 24√ó7, and now it‚Äôs been obliterated.I feel like I‚Äôm completely blind, deaf &amp; dumb.Next up they‚Äôll likely target John Campbell for destruction.

                I take it 4Chan is down?
I get that the statists are gong to try to drag you into NATO or Israel wars, but seriously, we got along without 4Chan for literally hundreds of thousands of years.
If you can‚Äôt live without 4Chan, how do you expect to get along if the whole ‚Äònet goes down?

                    Steve:how do you expect to get along if the whole ‚Äònet goes down?Excellent question.The Physical stuff is easy [the food, the @mmunition, the f!rearms]; the tragedy is the priceless insight we lose when a resource like /pol/ is destroyed.Figuratively speaking, losing /pol/ is like losing the Rosetta Stone.All I know is that I now have no information sources which I can trust.Without /pol/, I feel like I‚Äôm the reincarnation of frigging Helen Keller: blind deaf &amp; dumb.If anyone knows of quality sources for TRUE information [not FAKE nor FALSE information], then please clue me in.And, if necessary,the sources are welcome to come from Mother Russia herself.Without the Truth Speak of /pol/ to lean on, I feel like I‚Äôm completely psychologically defenseless &amp; naked.Again, any suggestions, for outlets which are serving up TRUE information, are suggestions which would be priceless.Thanks so much!!!PS: I am NOT looking for websites serving up advice or ideology or cant or any of that sort of nonsense.I need websites which serve up raw truthful unadulterated INFORMATION.Not cant.Not psyop nonsense.Not half-Truths.Not lies.Just truthful INFORMATION.

                        I hear and agree with everything you say regarding /pol.However, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs coming back. I don‚Äôt know if you knew of Salo Forum, but that was also taken offline a few years ago (by its creator, who went dissident mainstream on Substack). It was also a source of outstanding commentary and information (note: I don‚Äôt think /pol/ had been like that for a while; too much noise).At this point, there isn‚Äôt anything unless you can find the right Telegram channels and chat. But it‚Äôs not centralized any longer, and as a result, we‚Äôre somewhere in 1998-land right now on the Right, and rapidly moving backward to the dreaded year of 1991.Soon we‚Äôll have to survive without the internet. This is a good opportunity, because there‚Äôs not a ton of immediate pressure, to prepare for that world, because I believe it‚Äôs coming. We will need State IDs in five years to sign onto the internet; you might as well use the computers in the local police station at that point with Sarg looking over your shoulder.

            I think education has been the victim of Marxist/democratized lower-common-denominator ethics. I am old enough to remember having oral exams where you cannot hide your ignorance too easily, but this requires elitism as the tribunal will only consider students that are prequalified as having potential.No sense on wasting smart people time examining students that are too dumb to learn the basics. Oral exams are a way to remove the AI aids. Maybe couple it with paranoid searches for hearing aids.Many certifications that count and are expensive to take have proctoring to prevent fraud. The only education institutions highly vulnerable to AI are the lazy ones that cater to the masses. But for elite groups a mix of proctoring with oral examinations for deep philosophical areas can work.

        There is a massive difference between mimicry and creativity. That is why I often point out that AI will raise the floor for stupid people, but they will always have a ceiling. Genuinely intelligent people will use AI to make them faster and more efficient, raising their ceiling.Once you get past the initial overall floor-raising, the ceiling will be set by human traits of creativity, effort, intelligence, etc.A stupid person can use a calculator to overcome weaknesses in their computational skill. But a calculator is useless if you do not understand or comprehend the problem you are trying to solve.You can, for example, hammer a nail with a calculator. But why would you?Pro tip: the best way to proofread your work is to print it out on white paper, 12pt font, 1.5 space, and read it.One other point: since AI is being developed by different cultures by people speaking different languages, it is not surprising AT ALL that the machines will give different answers.  AI is not God.  It will be the product of the people who created it, replete with their biases, cultural influences, and subtle behavioral cues.  (e.g. use of contractions)in short, AI will disagree.  And we will soon have battles over whose AI is ‚Äúright‚Äù.  Just like we have battles over fact checkers, today.

                That‚Äôs how professionals do it. Important distinction (this not to you in particular) : Proofreading is not at all the same thing as copy editing.We have reached a kind of emotional or intellectual remove from the term ‚Äúartificial intelligence‚Äù b/c nobody says or even writes that; everybody writes and says ‚ÄúAI‚Äù so that the key word ‚Äúartificial ‚Äù is lost. But artificial means ‚Äúnot real.‚ÄùAlso, very few people any longer know the difference between grammar and usage. Mistakes in usage are far more common than mistakes in grammar.Vocabulary or the lack thereof is an even more widespread problem. ‚ÄúEmbattled‚Äù is wrongly thought to mean ‚Äúbeleaguered‚Äù or ‚Äúbesieged.‚Äù And ‚Äúparameters‚Äù is wrongly thought to be a synonym for ‚Äúperimeter‚Äù or ‚Äúlimits‚Äù or ‚Äúboundaries.‚Äù The list is a long one.Nor do most people know how to use a dictionary. No two dictionaries are the same, so you have to read the instructions (those pages in the front matter in tiny print on pages with lower-case Roman numerals) before you can use a dictionary correctly, which is why people will open a dictionary and say, ‚ÄúAha! It says right here that ‚Äúembattled‚Äù means ‚Äúbeleaguered.‚Äù And it is pointless to try to explain to such a person that he has to read the directions before using the dictionary. But all that front matter is not there by accident.The  root of the problem is GIGO. GIGO at school; GIGO everywhere else. We‚Äôve done it to ourselves. It‚Äôs that mania for ‚Äúequality.‚ÄùHappy Easter to all.

        i don‚Äôt know how well people here understand the way a ‚Äúlarge language model‚Äù works.  it does not comprehend English, nor have any understanding of any other subject.  it does text analysis and pattern matching.  it does not even know when it has produced a correct or incorrect answer.  you had better have a decent understanding of whatever you ask it about, so you can spot when it goes off the rails.  the first response it gives you is going to be the best you‚Äôll get out of it; attempts to improve this will introduce more mistakes.it is fun for record reviews, discussing the plots of movies, things like that. i asked grok if huck finn was implied to be mixed race, for jollies.  chatgpt is designed to censor any topics that go against the narrative, while grok is pretty open about things.  for me, grok is a replacement for using a search engine; at which it excels (since google search is garbage now).  and for those who mock me when i quote something form wikipedia, all the chatbots use it for a reference source.

                    I‚Äôve tested some to see if they can generate anything better than previous generations of text- and score-generating algorithms. No interest in ‚ÄúAI,‚Äù but I happen to have studied those.What‚Äôs available now is much better at making stereotypical things and much worse at making something ‚Äúnew‚Äù (low-probability). It misunderstands/resists demands for interesting results, as you‚Äôd expect from programming whose core principle isaverage everything. A layer of fixes could improve that, maybe even make it as good as any amateur algorithm from fifty years ago.(‚ÄúUse this algorithm from fifty years ago,‚Äù you tell it. Does it obey? Probably not.)‚ÄúAI‚Äù can make pictures really well, but they‚Äôre weird, and rarely in an interesting way. It‚Äôs like the art of actual crazy people: boring normal stuff with some mistaken understanding of the rules. The art that people speak of as ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù‚Äîextremely dissonant music, e.g.‚Äîis highly disciplined, at least at theruleslevel. AI pics are just kinda screwed up, like Charles Manson‚Äôs songs.Remember the pic-generating algorithms from a few years ago that ‚Äúthought‚Äù of everything as collages of demonic animal faces? That was neat‚Äîand also like a real schizophrenic.‚ÄúTech‚Äù (the people called ‚Äútech‚Äù) can‚Äôt make anything that even resembles intelligence, but they have a great gift for modeling severe mental illness. ThisForbidden Planetremake is terrible!

                I haven‚Äôt knowingly consulted AI, but as far as I can tell (admittedly not far), It‚Äôs like the phone call where a machine answers your call and tells you right off the bat that ‚Äúyour call is important to us‚Äù when it very obviously is not.
I find that if you just keep pressing ‚ÄúO,‚Äù eventually a human will answer. But how long will that last?

                Looks like I‚Äôm going to be Z‚Äôs twitter stenographer today.  He wrote this a couple days ago and it‚Äôs spot on.‚ÄúThe midwits think we have to physically remove the tens of millions of invaders. That is not physically possible and not desirable. Even if you physically remove them, they will return because the conditions that drew them here have not changed.The right approach is to change the conditions that make it possible to be an alien invader. Mandate e-verify for employment, offer rewards for reporting employers that hire illegals, mandate e-verify for social benefits, public schools and housing.Once it is near impossible to get work, a place to live or welfare checks, the problem begins to solve itself and at a much faster pace than deportations. What remains is the criminal class of aliens the beautiful people love so much‚Äù

        Maybe it is just me, but when I write an essay, I am not entirely sure what I will be writing when I start off. I get going, and after a few minutes, I have a few paragraphs and a few ideas for what to do with it.I do the same thing. Back when I used to try to teach writing to undergrads, I‚Äôd heavily emphasize outlining. Otherwise, I told them, you‚Äôll end up like me, who has to write five pages to get three usable ones (hard to believe I was ever so naive as to assume students would revise their work, but I was). I find that writing is, effectively, a different style of thinking. I can write on a topic for a half hour, and get a very different result than if Italkon a topic for a half hour (and I‚Äôm a very experienced public speaker, so there are very few ‚Äúummms‚Äù and ‚Äúahhs‚Äù when I lecture‚Ä¶but so much of what Iwritein the first draft is the equivalent of  ‚Äúummm‚Äù and ‚Äúahh‚Äù).

            On the other hand, you never have writer‚Äôs block or any difficulty in ‚Äúbreaking the blank page.‚Äù
Most people will suffer from that b/c they have it firmly but  unconsciously in mind that they have to begin at the beginning. Once you explain that that is not necessary‚Äìprecisely because it IS writing‚Äìthey never have that problem again.

        ‚ÄúMaybe it is just me, but when I write an essay, I am not entirely sure what I will be writing when I start off. I get going, and after a few minutes, I have a few paragraphs and a few ideas for what to do with it. This happens in a few cycles until I have about what I want for a daily post. Then I think about how to put a bow on it.‚ÄùNot just you. Probably just about every writer. You write a few lines and that gets the creative juices flowing. Other ideas occur, which you also jot down. At the end you have a sprawling and disorganised mess. Now begins the work of pruning and discarding, deciding what to keep, providing connecting and logical links, providing a sense of flow, putting the main ideas into separate paragraphs, and making better word choices. For experienced writers this is not hard work.I‚Äôm thinking of Tolkien‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Hobbit‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Lord of the Rings.‚Äù Originally he made Gandalf one of the dwarfs. After much rewriting  he became a wizard. Aragorn was initially just a bloke in a pub, as Tolkien himself admitted. Later he became the rightful king of Gondor. G.R.R. Martin, on the other hand, is an example to avoid. He just didn‚Äôt do any pruning, as a consequence of which his story is now completely out of control ‚Äî too many characters, too many plot lines, and no way of tying it all together in the remaining two volumes (which will never come out).

        This is now my most favorite blog post about grammar and writing. Twice it made me laugh out loud, with the mention of giving MS Word a stroke, and the thing about the schoolmarm.I remember commenting recently that Ilike[the only time, evaaar] that there are typos in your writing, Z Man, only because that ensures I know it is actuallyyouwho are doing the writing, and not some AI bot.I absolutely appreciate all of these things your brought up, about writing. It is a topic I [also] enjoy, and could discuss for hours. (Not everyone‚Äôs thing, of course.)Karl Horst‚Äôs comment about vocabulary is interesting. I think he is correct about the under-40s having only about 20,000 words. (Note the proper usage of the hyphen there. Some people really overuse them!)Plus then  you have receptive vs. productive vocabulary, and receptive vocabulary is probably higher, because peole can understand (receptive) wordsin context, versus thinking of an interesting word themselves (productive).Oh well. In the end, most people today, as Z said, should never have learned to read (and thus become janitors or similar), because they use AI and/or Grammarly to sound intelligent online, while really, they should just go grab that mop.

                This reminds me of how Mississippi had great success in bringing up reading scores in their schools a few years back; vaulted from dead last to middle of the pack among state rankings. Louisiana and Alabama followed suit and had the same result. But in all the articles the word ‚Äúphonics‚Äù was never mentioned. They called the secret saucethe so-called science of reading. Of course phonics is not a science, but it‚Äôs just odd that the dreaded word ‚Äúphonics‚Äù itself was never used. Like it‚Äôs a P-word, lol. I‚Äôm guessing that the reason phonics was never given its due was because of how hard the teachers associations fought against it for decades.And it goes without saying that although all kids scores improved, the same racial gap was present after just the same as before.

                    Decades ago the biddies rejected (proven) phonics for Whole Language Learning meaning, the kids just pick it up in big chunks naturally.
Chick logic. It failed miserably, but the grrls (NEA, AFT) cannot of course admit error of their grand idea, thus invented a new moniker for good old phonics.
See?! They invented Science of Reading all by themselves and don‚Äôt need successfully vetted tradition or the Ebil Ebil Patriarchy!  They are BETTER.  And yes, this is how your society functions.

        AI chats are like knowledgeable intelligent friends who have a drinking problem. If you use them like that you‚Äôll be okay. They can explain basic concepts and can be great for bouncing ideas off of. You can badger them with a thousand questions until you finally get what you want. Honestly, unless you have a big network of people to talk to about certain topics, AI is not a bad start. You will always have to correct it. Think of it as your smart yet oddly retarded assistant.

            I find the opposite to be the case. They are uniformly reinforcers of Gell-Mann effect. I can use them to help jog my memory if I understand the concept, but some of the details are a little foggy. But I‚Äôm also finding myself saying, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not right. How can I query the AI in a way to fill in the correct details?‚Äù
So obviously, counting on it to give me a summary of something of which I have no understanding is foolish. On the same order as believing whatever you see in Wiki on any matter even tangentially political.

        Along this line Z-man, you and maybe RamZPaul should talk about  impact of technology in the next 20 years. Especially how it affects jobs for young men. You interact with businesses a lot so you might have an idea how a young man of OUR people can make a living.  There are lot of cyber security jobs. They don‚Äôt require hardcore programming or anything. There‚Äôs also a lot of data monkey jobs. I‚Äôd like to get your updated assessment of the modern corporate job market. As well as whether there are more opportunities at smaller and mid-sized businesses.

        With twenty fiction books in ten years, I have never used an ES to assist my writing.  About five years ago I began using the Grammarly plug in; and rejected at least half of its suggestion.  I have had three copyeditors over said decade, the most recent for five years.  A good copyeditor, like a good cover designer, is worth their weight in gold.
Even scanning all my books, I do not think a clever toaster would be able to mimic my style, much less the expanse of my future history.

        ‚ÄúWhat this suggests is that the ceiling for AI may very well be the absolute middle of human creativity when it comes to communication.‚ÄùThis would seem to be the case. And it‚Äôs funny that even when I don‚Äôt know for certain something was written by AI, I know it was written by AI. This is particularly common in online product descriptions. They are all grammatically and semantically correct, but the text reads almost like a charicature of what a real person would say about the product. It touches all the obvious bases, but it‚Äôs just too much on the nose. And there is no real style except for an almost juvenile ‚Äúdesire‚Äù to write with style. And that ‚Äústyle‚Äù can be characterized simply as a slightly overweening enthusiasm. Bottom line‚ÄìI don‚Äôt think Poe, Shakespeare, Dante and Dostoevskii have much to fear.

        I frequently include (deliberately) a grammatical or spelling error in my writing in order to indicate that it is not an AI submission. Yes, you can instruct an AI to do this also, but no one does that. The Singularity will have arrived when all the blogs and commenters on the internet are bots. Will we even be able to tell when this happens, of has it already?

        ‚ÄúMaybe it is just me, but when I write an essay, I am not entirely sure what I will be writing when I start off. I get going, and after a few minutes, I have a few paragraphs and a few ideas for what to do with it. This happens in a few cycles until I have about what I want for a daily post. Then I think about how to put a bow on it.‚ÄùNot just you. In the vast majority of cases in which I‚Äôm writing something that is relatively brief and informal, that is exactly what I do. I‚Äôll begin with a couple of basic ideas for the piece, and then, as I write, the essay ramifies and takes on a life of its own. It‚Äôs only when attempting something much more substantial‚Äìdissertation, book‚Äìthat I plan the project in advance. In this case, one has to collate the data and break it into discrete subjects, which form the basis of chapters. And sometimes I‚Äôll have to create outlines of the individual chapters.

        High performance focused driving is a lot like writing. AI is a lot like an autonomous automobile. I see these cars in Scottsdale all the time. Whatever the programmed logic is that rules their behavior also limits their ability to deal with situations outside of their programming, limited by their programming. These systems may be able to learn but translating that into something useful real time is beyond their capabilities. The engagement required for an individual to pilot a manual shift vehicle is a lot more than driving an automatic. The control is in the mind of the driver/writer. Manual shift sports cars require more focus from the pilot than automatic Honda Accords. The best writing is done manually by an individual the old fashioned way. Creating text and then synthesizing it shaping it using their minds to control the writing. In the moment. Good writing is like good driving. If AI can be a useful tool for writers great. As a substitute for high performance focused writing I do not see it.

        This approach to writing is very interesting ‚Äì I like to use hyphens. You have attempted to use AI to streamline your effort and it actually takes more work. I have always said AI is going to be okay until it disobeys us. Sounds like it is on that track with your experiments.Also, now I‚Äôm wondering if some of the cheap Kindle books I‚Äôve purchased from Amazon are actually written by bots. I say this because some of the writing wanders around and is superfluous. Sometimes entire paragraphs make no sense. If the author is not AI, then it‚Äôs a really dumb human.
