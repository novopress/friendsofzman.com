        I always thought that Eugenics arose from the work of Galton, who coined the word, in England and spread from there.

        That’s a good point about Moldbug popularizing certain ideas. I guess my objection is in the presentation more than anything. There’s a patronizing tone to a lot of these guys, especially Moldbug and Land.National Review Online has setup a blog for a few DE types to post. I see the same rambling, long-winded stuff I remember from Moldbug. Maybe it is an affectation. There was one post there that was 4,000 words. I was able to summarize the main points in three sentences. That’s what I always found with Moldbug. I’d read a 5,000 word post and get three sentences worth of information. Drove me crazy.But, styles are all about taste. My aesthetic is to the plain side of the Amish. I like simple.

        When there is “Neo-” on some political ideology I know its trouble.
My dream is to have a Time Travel machine and prevent the rise of the Abrahamic Religions, Marxism-Lenism-Trotskyism, and any “internationalist” ideology or religion.

        I love neo-reactionaries of all types. But.Moldbug, and especially his links, were a great learning experience for me so his value may depend on what you already know. But I never for a moment forgot that he took seasteading very seriously for a long time, an idea which takes thirty seconds of thought to blow up three different ways.Tocqueville–The mental habits which suit action do not always promote thought. The world is not directed by long and learned proofs. All its affairs are decided by the swift glance at a particular fact, the daily examination of the changing moods of the crowd, occasional moments of chance, and the skill to exploit them.
