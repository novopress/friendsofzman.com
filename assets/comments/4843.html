        Perhaps the scaling problem with 3D printers is solved if we get them to print themselves in a closet somewhere and presto!  An assembly line is created!

        I see two applications. First, time critical parts, situations where money is almost literally no object. An oil rig needs a widget to stay in operation. You can fly the part from Tulsa to a platform in the Gulf, or you can fab it on site using an expensive computerized maker. The second application is making parts that don’t lend themselves to scale production because you don’t expect you will ever need 5,000 framuses.The other application would be military spare parts for units at the end of an extended supply line. You always stock service parts, but invariably the part you do need is on back order or is only available at a depot in Pennsylvania.

        3D printing?Let’s call it modeling shall we?But of course, in comparison to CNC machining, it’s just anothercampaign about “tolerance”, isn’t it?The market has ALREADY been injected with cheep, crappy linear bearings (bushings), positioning motors, (limited resolution), etc., for toy versions of “platforms”.Hmmm, I wonder, if I put a knife, or pen, or cake icing caulking gun,  where the router is SUPPOSED to go on the CAD/CAM machine………Hey, If I reverse the air flow/electric polarity of the vacuum/electromagnetic material hold down…….Hey, if I turn the wire EDM controls to “build up” instead of “vaporize” (or alternate between the two)………..Of COURSE I’d charge a fortune for the proprietary “refills”!

        The 3D manufacturers will someday open up their choke on printers and consumables; right after they go bankrupt. Currently they’re operating on the ink-jet printer business model.

        Uh oh, a robot just killed a worker in Germany.It seems straight out of science fiction, but we are really just in the infancy of robot technology. While I do love science, I’m not going to pretend that I know where the robotics field will take us. So many ways it could go. The whole 3D thing is interesting, yet clunky at this stage, but the tech behind it, used in ways we cannot now imagine, just might contribute to The Next Big Thing, changing humankind forever. As of now, I’m most interested in its application in the medical field re: the printing of organs.

        Surely the point of this piece here wasn’t a criticism directly of 3D printing per se, but about the fact that we think that the latest technology will change things dramatically, although it rarely does.Everything has an application. That’s a given. Some of the applications are more relevant to some people than others, and here I usually cite electric screwdrivers versus old-fashioned ‘hand-driven’ ones. Yes, the new-fangled electric screwdriver is faster, but once it goes wrong it goes wrong faster, but sometimes you need to ‘feel’ how the screw is going in and ease up if necessary. Therefore, best to have both at hand.One of the shocks I liked to give my computer students was that everything important to us was invented in a golden era between about 1850 and 1925, or at least known about so that further investigation could take place (i.e, the Atomic bomb). My students’ reaction was to point at their monitors and say, but this internet thingy is new!Nope, basically it’s a television attached to a telephone line, I’d reply. Without those, the internet wouldn’t exist. What is exciting is how people make new use of existing technology, or adapt it to benefit others (or themselves… Lets not be too altruistic here) but we still trade on an era that seems long gone.I also liked to point out that ‘progress’ and the ‘future’ were never going to be as imagined. Predictions in 1960 that we would all have private helicopters has turned out to be well wide of the target, but then I think of the use of drones and think, oh yes… there was an idea that was turned somewhat. You might not be able to fly personally as predicted but you can attach a camera to a small device and get a bird’s eye view.

        As I’ve said before, I’m a high school STEM teacher. Our program got our first 3D printer in 2006, before 3D printing was ‘cool’.  (it’s always been cool, though) We now have six 3D printers in our program (including stereolithography), which allow our students to design a product and fabricate a mockup or prototype for their project.  It really does help students to see how they can go from a design to a finished product, and it motivates them to get involved with engineering.  But, we don’t just print cupcakes and chess pieces.  That’s what people do with toys – ours are not toys.That being said, 3D printing is not, and has not ever been, about manufacturing.  As someone said above, it’s about getting a mockup/prototype ready to show your boss.  Then, you develop a CNC or injection molding program to manufacture the part.  My students know that, and use the printers with that in mind.When they then see the injection molding and CNC at work, the light bulb goes off.  We can make so many more products with the CNC or injection molding, and the kids know this.  That’s learning, and that’s something that I have really enjoyed about 3D printing – the step from prototyping to manufacturing.

        3D printing technology right now is about where internal combustion engine technology was in 1889.  A lot of the value is in modeling at this moment.  If you are a car designer and want to show your boss’ boss — who is probably just a hopped up ex-fratboy salesman anyway — what your new design will look like, you’ll probably do better with a 3D model than an AutoCAD file.The rule of thumb from first practical device to mass adoption runs 20 to 30 years.  (Another example is computing; it’s about 25-30 years from the first practical mainframes to universal desktop computing depending on when you start and stop counting.) Efficient electric motors were available around 1900, but most workshops are steam or water powered until around 1930.  3D printing technology isn’t even at the 1900 – electric motor equivalent yet.But if you want something that can make real stuff cheaply right now, you can buy a home CNC mill right now for less than a motorcycle… make your own gears, cams, valves, and other stuff right in your garage:  e.g.http://www.tormach.com/Not as sexy as 3d printing, but unthinkable before PCs and CAD/CAM software.  I haven’t looked, but I would guess that there are freeware and not-so-freeware sites out there providing the IP for old engine and transmission parts to hobbyists and other dilettantes right now.

            Modeling is an application for 3-D printing that makes sense, but is hardly revolutionary. The trouble is 4-D video is going to lap 3-D printing here shortly. Giving the meathead boss a moving hologram of your idea that can be e-mailed to his phone is better than a puppet show with plastic figurines you printed in your office. Like I said, there’s a use for the technology, but we will not be printing out clothes at home.
