        Trump gets less overt support than nods of understanding, the “I get where you are coming from” (IMHO).  The Tea Party was a mostly bottom-up attempt to channel the feelings of the “leave me alone” crowd into something organized and politically powerful.  Neither Trump nor the Tea Party are particularly meaningful, except as signals of a broader alienation of the middle.  Many people do just want to be left alone to live their lives in the way they see fit, with the values and priorities that they carry with them.  The overbearing government and its social and media allies are now intrusively demanding open allegiance to a set of values and priorities not shared by many.  Something, somewhere, but most likely not from Trump or the TP, will stimulate a broad response from people who often do not speak up.  These things usually come about at unexpected times and places, for reasons not identified ahead of time.  And when that happens, the result will be the equivalent of poking a wolverine with a stick.

        This article steps gingerly into the current national dilemma, which is that many Americans wish to be left alone to live their lives. The Powers That Be demand public affirmation of their cultural and social priorities from each individual American, which grates against being left alone to live one’s life.  Trump is a signal that many people are not ready to acquiesce quite yet.  In that sense, TPTB are correct in that many of their enemies are domestic, and populate the Tea Party.  TPTB may not be so happy that personal public acquiescence has been asked for.  In other words, “poke a wolverine with a stick, and…”

            What wolverine, Dutch?  Trump is a preening peacock, i.e., great at showing off, but no bird of prey.  The Tea Party is more of a yappy little terrier than it is a vicious little badger.

        So many points you raise, and interesting ones too.W.B.Yeats poem ‘The Second Coming’ touches on an important component of your post:Turning and turning in the widening gyreThe falcon cannot hear the falconer;Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhereThe ceremony of innocence is drowned;The best lack all conviction, while the worstAre full of passionate intensity.And there is more that you raise. On traitors in society: some of us believe that the greatest traitors are now at the head of the show, pretending one thing and lying about other matters and all the while — if not plotting — allowing our enemies to gain a foothold.We do have enemies even though our supine media and ineffective upper classes like to pretend otherwise. The enemies are no longer at the gates; they are inside and taking the money. More, we have had the worst of the world thrust upon us, almost universally without planning or debate. The idea we accept the world coming to us with all their problems and hatreds is a curious one because at no point did we vote for this or even have it up for discussion.Meanwhile, those with too much free time on their hands shout and scream and bicker over trivialities with no one able or willing to tell them to shut up and sit down. If Jonathan Swift were alive today he would have a field day with a satire on society now and how we have surrendered our intellect to the unstable and insecure, and how we have lost our direction in favour of chasing vague and pseudo-romantic whims that cut across what we are.We are of a thede, and no amount of legislation or lies or threats or even honeyed words from overpaid ‘commentators’ will alter the fact that we instinctively cling to our own group, preferring our own tribe and ways. In time we awaken and will go back to that primal instinct, and then the centre will hold once again.

            “The problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubts, while the stupid ones are full of confidence.”
I believe Bertrand Russell first said that, but others have said it. That’s what comes to mind reading the last two lines of that first stanza.

        If there is no trust, there is no society. Security, prosperity, and culture depend on Trust, between the People and the Government, between the People and the Market, between the People and formerly revered institutions, between the People and the People. When Trust starts to erode, which we are seeing at every level of society now, society starts breaking down. Many years of unrest lie ahead.
