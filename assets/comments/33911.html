        But what we almost certainly would not have enjoyed had Mr. Thurmond become president are the fruits of forced racial integration as it was imposed in later decades: the tidal wave of black crime against whites that is now commonplace; black race riots from Detroit and Watts to Los Angeles in 1992; the virtual destruction of American cities as a black underclass, protected by the federal government,pushed out whitesterrified for their own lives and those of their families; the destruction of American education and the transformation of the schools into day-time prison camps for hoodlums. No forced busing; no affirmative action; no “hate crime” hypocrisy; no“Afrocentric”or “multiculturalist” garbage poured into our children’s heads. Probably no mass immigration. No self-hate for whites. No guilt. No fear.sam Francis

            Our nearest city, the state capital, is now nearly 42 percent black.  White Flight was a sneer word in the local media as HBO put out Banging In Little Rock.I attended a wedding at the former home of one of the chief instigators of the 1957 school integration debacle.  It was a beautiful old mansion in the heart of Little Rock, now in the middle of the hood.  All was quiet the night of the wedding, but there was a shooting on the corner two days later.

                there’s no slur for blacks moving in or out (if only they would) but if whites move in it’s gentrification and if we move out it’s white flight

                    The thing that always pissed me off about the term gentrification is that the neighborhoods were traditionally White, not black.  These neighborhoods were White, then blacks caused them to move out by victimizing them with crime, and that was progress.  But if the Whites want to move back in, that is definitely not progress.
This is why I don’t believe ideology even exists in America.  If it did, they would welcome the “diversification” gentrifying causes.  But they don’t. It’s all selective based on their asinine preferences.

                        I live in a small town much beloved for its “quaintness” and of course its “good school”. All that kicks up the value of my property, which in a couple of years I’ll need to sell to finance my retirement, so… all well and good. However, these local churches are a menace. Yep, “diversity” is on the march here; our little town now boasts Afghan and African families, situated in financed housing, who cannot speak English, whose kids pilfer candy and other small stuff from the Dollar General, who ride around the town on bikes and asking for money or “something to do”. And all here because of the churches.

                            Disgusting. Mayorkas paid the churches to do this to our small towns with the approval of corporate America. I got several alumni emails starting in ’20 about the need to get 75K Afghanis into the country and give them iPads, laptops, broadband accounts, phones … … … Of course the CEOs who signed that declaration were mostly Hindu/White-but-not-Huwhite/Muslim … … And of course their goodies and handouts to these loyal allies were all their companies’ products and services.Mayorkas was happy to give them all money so the managers at the top could rake in the money and our country would be destroyed. I hope I live to see what must happen to Mayorkas be done and be done with great ceremony as such a vile betrayal must be done with.

                            The mainline denominations are the spearhead–so to speak–of pathological altruism. They consider themselves great humanitarian organizations but they’re doing far more harm than good in this world.

                                I was a garden-variety Catholic at our local parish. Last time the special collection came out – not the regular collection for our heat bill, our plumbing issues, our local charity outreach, and all that normal stuff but – for the Catholic Charities. I had a short conversation with our pastor about where all that CC money goes. And he’s like, well, it helps our community because we can support desperate people by giving them a new start.Meanwhile, we are getting yet more special collections to replace our roof. So I asked, after a week or two of contemplation, are all these new neighbors Catholic? Aside from money, is there some angle that benefits our Church?Hesitation… then,“Not necessarily, but it enriches our community and we’re doing Christian work, and that is what we are here to do.”Yeah, thanks. Our “Christian work” now means I lock my doors, which in my 65 years in this town is new. Now, don’t get me wrong: The Presbys, the Methodists and the Episcopalians are all working the same vein, with the result that my community is turning into shit.I don’t attend any more. It’s a loss in my life but it sure beats helping to finance the ruin of my town.

                                Last time I spoke to a Methodist minister about his congregation doing it, he didn’t really have a reason other than the district encouraged it. When I spoke to several of the congregants, they were dead-set against it — this was the work of the pastor and the administrative council, and they refused to allow a vote in the congregational business meetings. Their only part in it was to shut up and be nagged into giving to the fund, and have the money they give to outreach be diverted into resettlement.

            Thurmond would have just slowed things down a bit. The forces pushing for integration would still be there. Without a continuous stream of Thurmonds, we were end up here anyway, just maybe a few years later.The problem with an endless stream of Thurmonds would be that those forces do not disperse over time. One can believe that had it been allowed to build and boil over, we would have been able to justify extreme actions to put it down, sure, but then explain Detroit or Watts.Until we get serious about things and pull an Escape from New York around all our centers of diversity, it’s going to get worse.

                When there was a will, both popular and political, to punish negro pathology harshly, there were no Newarks or Detroits of Watts’s to speak of. The nuggras understood what would happen to them if they got out of line. When that will evaporated in the mid-sixties, the lid popped off the pressure cooker and here we are living in African squallor, dysfunction and moral chaos.

                    That did not happen overnight. Indeed, the Radical Republicans got that ball rolling officially in 1866 Civil Rights Act. Being damnYankees, they couldn’t help themselves.
It’s not that the will ended in the mid (19)60s, that’s just when the lid popped off. The combination of not having a constant stream of Thurmonds, plus the gradual buildup of force in the name of “civil rights” was inexorable.

                        But those earlier civil rights initiatives, in their juridical and moral impact, were picayune compared to the acts of ’64 and ’65. And what’s more, the will to enforce was exiguous. That’s why Jim Crow–that blessed institution–persevered well into the 50s. But I will say this–when Truman integrated the military in ’48, warning klaxons should have been wailing. That act prefigured the Little Rock abomination and the madness of ’64 and ’65.

                            Maybe. The use of whipping posts for miscreants was discontinued in the Eastern US, while the West maintained them for another half century or so. Public executions, same. Had we actually kept the punishment system intact (which included whippings for Abolitionists, BTW) there might have been a chance of keeping the lid on a little longer. But the world became pussified, no longer interested in doing what it took to maintain civilization.

                    We’re not even close to any will to punish today, and instead it’s about elevating blacks.  In popular culture alone, such as sports, movies, music, Super Bowl halftime shows, blacks replacing whites in historical movies and re-makes, advertising and on and on it goes.  There’s really no escaping it.  It’s all about Whites drowning in blackness, whether it’s in the physical space of cities and schools or entertainment.

                        No question about it. Material life in AINO is still at Western levels. Everything else, however, has been Africanized. If and when the economy crashes there will be precious little to distinguish AINO from Angola.

            Racial integration was always inevitable, once the New Deal regime was fully in place. You can draw a straight line from that event to that kid’s murder in Texas. This was a process that was always going to play out and no election would have changed it.

                What did the New Deal have to do with integration?  I don’t know FDR’s feelings about blacks, but I don’t recall anything in the New Deal that promoted integration.  Maybe there’s something that I don’t know.
Eisenhauer and WW2 seems to be a better place to affix blame.  And the way he killed the Germans prisoners after the war, I’ve really come to hate him.

            In my corner of the world, there are no people of any &lt;90IQ race. Education has been demolished, with a passion, all the same.It has been done by the intrinsic “democratization” of everything in our time: everything must be accessible to everyone: as that principle is enforced or catches roots, anyone meaningfully above average (in intellect, and/or will to do genuine work and apply some standards) absquatulates a line of work or an occupational context. Only those who are both mediocre and enjoy wallowing in mediocrity are left; from then onward, it is a race, or a moderately-paced, plunge to the bottom.Where schools aren’t day-time prison camps, it is certainly (much) better, but, no, education hasn’t survived (and the combination of very high women involvement, and men fleeing the sector is easily the prime driving factor of that).

                Sam Dixon once said thte south had no intellectual tradition to defend itself; they were not interested in books. While the puritans and northerners were obsessed with it. I told this to a friend and she said that being around blacks lowers standards of whites. I think there’s something to that.

                    being around blacks lowers standards of whitesMakes some hypothetical sense but it’s hard to quantify. As much as we can quantify, southern white kids do about the same in school as white kids anywhere else. And the general tendency in the south is for there to be white schools and negro schools, relative to white neighborhoods and negro neighborhoods. (obviously this is inexact). Which reflects the reality that in the south, whites and blacks may live in the same towns, but not so much in the same zip codes, if they can help it. So while southern whites do rub shoulders with negros, in passing, more often than their midwestern or northeastern counterparts do, I believe it’s overstating the case to say that they generally spend a lot of time “being around” them. If they can help it. Every southern city has a black side and a white side (less enforced than it used to be).And most small towns in the south are either one or the other. Because there is something that exists on a large scale in the south that is unknown in the rest of the country, that being the rural negro, who covers large regions of the rural south where scarcely a white person is to be found. In particular parts of MS, AL, GA, SC, NC, LA, and AR.

                    The standard that’s most lowered by proximity to blacks is how expensive your bicycle can be.As a kid I was given the impression that literariness was a Southern thing. Faulkner, Percy, Williams, etc. It was a kind of regional knack that others didn’t have—not even Jews, who wrote just as much but never in a Great American sort of way. I remember in dramatizations of his life, Poe always had a more Carolinian accent that he’d have had in reality, so you’d understand that he was a serious writer, consumed with this difficult and mysterious Southern art.Northerners do enjoyclaiming the authority of texts. I think you have to hate books to do that.

                In many countries, alternatives to what we in the USA call “public” schools is forbidden.  Where there is an alternative, there is hope for standards promoting meritocracy—because that is what parents seek.  So you’re observations are quite true, but not universal or inevitable.

        Worked with risk models for nearly 40 years…and brother, let me tell you how many times they were horribly (and expensively) wrong. Some have gotten better over decades–usually via expensive mistakes.  But one always finds there are “X” factors that could not be anticipated.  Take the Palisades fires…the wildfire models assumed 1) reservoir water would be available (it was empty), 2) response assets would be pre-positioned once the “red flag” went up, they were busy doing DEI seminars…or something and 3) normal brush clearance/thinning was done.  None were. Humans, being humans, can never execute to a “model” whatever stripe it comes in. One of my last acts before retirement was “de-risking” CA for that reason. Got us out early and it paid off. Similarly, chose to get out of the NYC metro and retire to a small town in the Blue Ridge.  The risk tail for society has gotten “fatter” and I can more easily manage those risks from a place that is 92.8% “non-vibrant”. Plus it’s just nice.

                L. Ron Hubbard was mid-XX century. The man got in trouble while holding a naval commission for shooting at things that weren’t there and was later diagnosed as schizophrenic. He went on to become a bad science fiction author and start up a very successful amateur psychology grift which he then dressed up as an anti-psychology UFO religion in order to escape prosecution for fraud, which survives today as the Church of Scientology.

                    Lucius Vorenus:“amateur psychology grift“
I thought L Ron Hubbard was anti-PSYCHIATRY, not anti-Psychology.
Psychiatry is nonsense.
Whereas psychology is arguably the single most important phenomenon in the entire modern world.
Nothing else comes even remotely close to the omnipotence of Psychology in the modern world.
In the modern world,Logic [&amp; Pragmaticism] don’t even amount to rapidly fading memories of ghostly spirits from antiquity.
The modern world is Psychology Uber Alles.

                Read a book about him in college. It was written by a former Scientologist, so I’m aware it was a certain POV. Quite a character! Utterly charismatic, apparently. Sui generis. Short story: he took psychology and dressed it up in science (Dianetics), later religion in sci-fi (Scientology) for the modern age. Naval stuff, book claimed he wanted to take over the world. Would make a wild movie.

                    The existence of Sea Org should scare the hell out of everyone, and Scientology has transcended its origins as a self-insulating con to become a deeply evil transhumanist force; one that differs in its goals and methods from the prevailing order and so run afoul of it, but one that is also extremely well-provisioned thanks to the resources it continually extracts from its following of mostly fabulously wealthy neurotics. In the event of an actual collapse of state power they are in a far better position to exercise it themselves than just about anybody else. Reds and blacks are significant but mostly fractious, local threats compared to a secretive, ideologically driven, well-organized, well-heeled bunch who have already functioned as a closed, parallel society for decades.

                I suppose it’s that Hubbard and Strauss both cultivated hierarchy/rivalry among their followers/students by giving various of them the impression thatonly theywere granted access to some (of the) esoteric truth. So “Straussianism” survives as a nepotistic cult or two instead of as an apprehensible philosophy (or history of philosophy or whatever), and all good men roll their eyes and look for the exit when you say the name, just like Scientology.The analogy I’d use isn’t Hubbard but Leonard Bernstein. He and Strauss were great at giving you the impression that somethingsomebody else wrotewas really interesting and you should pay very close attention to it—they were natural teachers—but their “original” work is barely competent kitsch and even their biggest fans don’t really value it.Tried to make this comment as annoying as possible to all Straussians, by the way, because they’re nerds and should feel bad all the time.

                        LOL no.Strauss was a Platonist who understood the danger of questioning the established order of things, and that philosophical inquiry will likely result in events like the trial and execution of Socrates. Consequently the intellectuals have to couch their arguments in terms that will not stampede the herd.The average hoi polloi schlub is not interested (or capable of) Socratic dialogue (which is why the mythmakers of the Platonic cave have so much power over him). He will vote to execute Socrates every time, and the truths revealed by Socratic inquiry will then be silenced.That’s not a “cult,” that’s been a basic problem — perhaps THE most basic problem — in the history of political philosophy.As Friedrich Nietzsche (wrote in a somewhat different context) “Our highest insights must – and should – sound like follies and sometimes like crimes when they are heard without permission by those who are not predisposed and predestined for them.”

            Right now I would say the risk model for the U.S. is exceptionally bad.   Nothing being done that causes me to have any hope that the U.S. survives as a political entity into 2035, and that could be optimistic.Trump may have his heart in the right place, hard to tell,  however like his last term he is in the process of crashing and burning.   When you get Tammy Bruce being asked what the U.S. position is concerning the IDF murdering 15 paramedics, execution style,  and her response is:  “It is all the fault of Hamas,”  then this administration has little agency in its’ own foreign policy.The damage could extend to the entire world if Trump decides to start a major air campaign against Iran.  The Iran talks come down to Israel and the U.S. want Iran to destroy all of their enrichment facilities as happened in Libya.   Iran will never do that so what is the point of the talks?   In fact Iran would be crazy to do that in light of the psychopathic nature of the U.S. and Israel.

If any of them takes out an LNG carrier or such LNG facilities as those of Qatar, it would be like setting off an atomic bomb, as well.Decapitating the command structure of Iran means no more shore batteries.Russia will have no defender of her soft underbelly, China will lose a key energy supplier, the Shia Crescent will lose its general.An additional benefit will be millions more Muslim refugees flooding Europe, putting breaking pressure on the EU and of course the white race, leaving whites few options but to submit to the dominant power.(h/t Matt Bracken, WRSA/Kit Klarenberg, and Saml Adams)p.s.- a dozen alternate sites were elected for Japan, conditions led to Hiroshima / Nagasaki.

                    I’m sure there are Zionists in the administration that are crazy enough to think that’s a good idea but Trump isn’t one of them and unlike Biden, he’s actually in charge of things. What I think is a lot more likely is that the neocons and Zionists will talk Trump into some kind of conventional attack on Iran based on the idea that it’s forever 1991 and it will be another “cakewalk”. Except Operation Persian Picnic will quickly turn into a catastrophe with aircraft carriers and oil tankers on the bottom of the Persian Gulf and massive Iranian missile strikes on Israel. They’ve already demonstrated the capability to hit Israeli bases. This might not start WWIII itself but would almost certainly plunge the world into economic depression and chaos. Once that happens global war probably becomes inevitable.

            Anyone who works with models knows that the model is wrong, the question is by how much. We live in a country ruled by magical thinking and midwits, though, so this is forgotten and the models become fact. This is most clearly true with “climate change” where the models said NYC would be underwater 20 years ago, well NYC is not underwater but they still point to their models when demanding total control.The 2008 crisis, I know that people on the right tend to blame the government’s intervention in lending markets, and people on the left tend to blame rapacious actors and the banks, and the fact is, both are true. But the entire financialization of the housing market (CDOs, etc.) was built off a few models that were proven to be disastrously wrong. A lot of people knew about the flaws in the model, but take that to the CEO of the bank who is making billions off the models. Good luck.

                Z-man long ago during the early COVID scamdemic referenced William Briggs, a statistician with a common sense view of the current modeling of the disease mortality.  One of the best references Z-man ever made.What I took away from Briggs was one essential point, “Models predict what you tell them to predict”.  This means that any conclusions drawn from a model are a direct result of the premises embedded within it.In short, to create a (perfect) model is to assume you have exact knowledge of the phenomenon being modeled.  Of course, this is nonsense for complex phenomenon on the cutting edge of science like climate change.  Models and modeling may be a reasonable tool for testing current understanding of a phenomenon under study, but for societal prediction and resource direction woefully inadequate.Folks who are infected with “scientism” never seem to “crack wise” however.

It’s also largely pointless. If you already have complete knowledge about it, there’s no point in creating a computer model. Just run the numbers once and you have your answer. It’s only when you intend to tweak the numbers to get the “right” answer that creating a model you can adjust becomes valuable.

                        Well, if we are *extrapolating* disease spread and mortality, a predictive—but correct—model seems quite useful.  For example, Covid was not nearly as deadly as predicted and arguably the preventive method to stop the spread was worse that the disease.  What of course occurred were that scientist grifters produced faulty models and claimed fame predicting the sky was falling.

                            True. Isn’t that just saying, “We don’t have exact knowledge of the phenomenon, so let’s just wing it”?
Just imagine if we built bridges or nuclear power plants that way.

                                Well yes, but that’s not what they said.  In their arrogance and hubris, many pretended that their model was “good enough” for societal direction/action.  A secondary argument  made was of the form, “what if we are right?”  This pretense might have been actively promoted or simply allowed through failure to correct misuse of the conclusions drawn by their model.In any event, the models have been proved wrong through incorrect predictions once reality unfolded.  With Covid, that was in a short timeframe and within memory of the rather average and dull public witness.  In the case of Climate Change, they have the benefit of making predictions exceeding the life expectancy of the general public.  This makes picking apart their models more difficult.

                    Remember the justification for the lockdowns came from Neil Ferguson model which had mortality vastly overstated. The fear-driven articles early in the scamdemic were almost always outputs from that model. Butbeforethat was going on, we had the perfect control experiment for COVID in the Diamond Princess, which told us everything.
So on the one hand we had a piece of junk BS model on a spreadsheet that was totally wrong and on the other hand we had a real-life controlled experiment with actual outcomes, and the elites chose the model.

                        No argument here.  That’s exactly what happened.  My general thinking is that we ran into an ugly confluence of at least two factors:  1) a general level of stupidity/craveness not previously found in the political class, and 2) a general decline in the population wrt to ability to remain calm in the face of adversity—they panicked.

                                ”I think it’s more correct to say they were deliberately spooked, by people who knowingly lied to them.”To me, that’s a distinction without a difference.I was not spooked and I was in receipt of the same information as everyone else in the public sphere.  It was obvious in very early 2020 that the disease was not nearly as dangerous when looked at within age cohorts and comorbidity.  Also, the official mortality numbers were within typical limits for other familiar diseases such as flu which had good years and bad years depending upon strain.  I believe in 1958, the flu punched out just as many people as early COVID had.We are not the same people/society as we once were.  Certainly prior to WWII when death by disease was more common in the pre-antibiotic days.  And definitely pre WWI when we had a poorer understanding of epidemic disease and contagion.

                I now see 2008 as the nuking of America to get the Black Klaus Schwab, that is, Barack Obama, in place as the cartoon villain.He had usurped his former boss, Hillary, but then placed her to become the Face of the Revolution after him.That failed with the Trump Surprise, so they tried again with Biden and Kamala. Biden was not the point, Kamala was.They nuked us again in 2020, in re of the financials of 2019.Kamala and her parents were molded by the same San Francisco cell that molded Barack and his key man, Eric Holder. Kamala was to be the puppet Face of the Revolution, of the Fundamental Transformation.(Hillary may have gotten her own ideas and already had a beef with Barack, so not seen as a total loss to their string-pullers. Kamala/Biden was their hasty, crap backup plan. Crap, but dependable crap.)

        Failure to recognize and deal with its spiteful mutants is perhaps the #1 failing of the west. Practically everyone you find on Bluesky is a spiteful mutant. Not all ideologues are spiteful mutants, but all spiteful mutants are ideologues (or at least fancy themselves as such). These people can’t be reached, reasoned with, debated etc. It does no good to show them charts and graphs. They have to be dealt with some other way. And the only way the west has seen fit to deal with them, so far, is to give them voter registration cards. So here we are.The negro problem was better managed, if not perfectly managed, prior to jewish manipulation of spiteful mutants. Who arguably didn’t require a lot of manipulation. At any rate, jewish manipulators wouldn’t have so many targets to manipulate were there no spiteful mutants.That UK sentencing commission that was in the news recently, which recommended harsher sentencing for whites than for wogs, is made up of 14 whites and 1 wog, and no jews that I can detect. Jared Taylor is probably right.

            The Puritan impulsive has driven the Anglosphere over the cliff. Jews were able to exploit it, of course, but the blame ultimately lies in the Puritans. It is amazing that Britain largely rid itself of the hyper Puritanism–the Church of Scotland hardly qualifies–yet seems to have been its biggest victims. The world’s best and brightest had a horrible flaw, perhaps genetic, and is on the verge of killing itself.

                Yes, Puritans and the Woke are whites who have adopted the Jewish mindset and values. They adopted it byidentifying.Our problem today, is the Karens. 4% of chief diversity officers are black.78% are white women. The Karens used a “black” front issue to boost themselves. Their political power is a matter of pure numbers, they are half of us. Their mindset, like the permanent minority (Jews), will not be based on defending territory, but on taking it using means they intuit and we don’t.For instance, leftists, being feebs, adopt women’s herd politics of weakness.Inclusion, safety, victimhood, validation, virtue signaling.One unacknowledged aspect is female bonding. Women use victimhood and drama to bond; males bond by friendly insult, which implies practical recognition.Women’s ladders of opportunity and expression are incomprehensible to men, because female bonding means she volunteers an intimate part of herself to the group; men remain private in their affairs.(For instance, she’s not just dating you, she’s sharing you with her ingroup of female friends, and accepts their judgements as part of that group bonding. Men see dating as a thing between him and her, and no one else.)This difference in bonding styles has effects; Venus’ ascent will ever be different from Mars. The Jew will ever be different from the Aryan.

            It’s not just that the spiteful mutants have not been dealt with, it is that they have been weaponized. The regime can churn these people out like a factory and then set them loose whenever they want. I was reading about antifa showing up to a university speech the other day! Remember when that was commonplace in 2017-2020? Then you didn’t hear about it at all for four years? The regime activates these people at will. Their creation is a feature not a bug.

Jared Taylor is probably right.As said before. The “potential narcissistic energy” in a critical mass of Whites (to be exploited by any other ill-meaning non-White group — each according to their planning and exploitation capacities) is rather unbounded.When you frame the majority of humankind, or of Whites, as “spiteful mutants”, you are making a serious effort to not acknowledge some harsh anthropologic (or racial) reality.

                “When you frame the majority of humankind, or of Whites, as “spiteful mutants”, you are making a serious effort to not acknowledge some harsh anthropologic (or racial) reality.”Not true at all.  You need to read up on the concept.  I recommend Edward Dutton’s Spiteful Mutants: Evolution, Sexuality, Religion, and Politics in the 21st Century (2022).  But there are numerous other works, see Woodley who first coin the term.The term “spiteful mutants” is used within this group as a shorthand description of a theory based of human DNA—that does not exclude racial acknowledgement—and the realization of the mutation load accumulation due to the absence of strict/harsh Darwinian selection beginning with the Industrial Revolution and accelerating with modern medicine in the 20th century.  The effects currently—and expectedly—lie mainly in the West, but will catch up with all races in all hemispheres as they adopt Western modernity/technology and escape Darwinian selection.As to solution, there are any number of answers that are discussed here and elsewhere.  1) a natural die out of Leftist crazies due to their inability to breed, 2) eugenics used to select out embryos with high mutational loading (e.g., crazy tendencies) 3) removal of spiteful mutants from societal decision making, e.g., earned suffrage.

The V@xxpocalypse will take care of a great deal of that.
It may take several generations for(((Albert Bourla)))‘s poison to destroy the various ovaries involved, but sometime circa 2040ish, yuge numbers of all sh!tlib females [presumably v@xxinated] will be suffering from ovarian disfunction &amp; failure.
Apparently(((Albert Bourla)))‘s approach is multigenerational, with each successive generation of female descendants being more &amp; more likely to suffer from ovarian failure.
It’s horrifying, but it is what it is.

                        So true; blind Nature “balances” itself with mass dieoffs.Your example is what I mean when I say that the God the proto-jews awoke is trying to kill itself, to lobotomize itself by getting the individual brain cells to kill each other.Since it has no hands, most of its effects only feed it, making the problem worse; that is why Whites arose as the penicillin, as the counter, to a force, to a machine that has no off switch.It cannot bear being self-conscious and aware, infected with a veneer of human-style sentience, knowing what it is, a something that feeds on pain, that floats on an ocean of the memories of agony.Bearing conscious sentience means it “feels”; its awareness feels like it wants to return to the innocence of the primitive garden from whence it arose, of not knowing, of not knowing of pain, nor of anything at all.The decomposition layer of organic formation, seems then to be anti-life; anti-sentience is its goal, awareness its curse.Alas, our concept of the gods is that of a comic book, of flying heroes and super-villians; the jewish writers of the comic books have kept alive that ancient view, teaching it and their values (as the secret supermen that walk amongst us) to us as they taught us with their original comic book, the Bible, as their storytellers have done with movies, and media of every kind.A pantheon of characters in a story that we can relate to, this is the ancient view of the world beyond. That is also what has been kept alive.

                            Forgive me. I hope some realize I’m trying to describe what people call Hell, what the primitive proto-jews awoke in their ignorance.
By cultivating it through lineages that could survive the touch of the Arc, they infected it with a patina of sentience.
Someday I would hope we understand what we’re dealing with, should any of this survive.
I will try to stay away from this subject in the future, and speak much less, having so little to add.

Bro.
It sounds like you’ve gone to war with an Egregore of the Zeitgeist.
Good luck; we’ll be rootin’ for ya.
Truth be told, I fear that we’ve all be assigned our own personal Egregores to degrade &amp; humiliate &amp; torture &amp; ruin us.
Our sole duty is to soldier on through the thick of it all, and make our way to the other side.

                        Just a note about Dutton.  He’s schtick is taking a nascent concept or theory and extrapolating upon it—often far ahead of research in the field.  In that, he’s as much a “futurist” as a scientist.  He’s a good read, but you have to realize not everything he cites is settled science of long duration.  However, he’s always ready to cite whatever research is out there, so you have sources to pursue.

            “That UK sentencing commission that was in the news recently, which recommended harsher sentencing for whites than for wogs,…”Ah, yet another example of how society has fallen once we abandon Christianity and the Bible.  It is written, “…an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth…”. Modern folk often confuse this passage as a call for retribution and vengeance.  Nonsense.  It was a call for *fair* or equitable punishment.  The poor man would suffer the same punishment as the rich man.I suppose we in the USA will see such codified soon, as such already occurs all too often.

        I hadn’t at all considered the murdered Texas kid in terms of ideology, but no doubt anti-racism led directly to his murder. Black violence can be ignored or explained away but it is always there. Segregation was a half-measure, and removal is the only solution although it is unlikely to happen (perhaps not as true any longer). The kid’s father indeed is more Bolshevik than Moonie.
Great show.

            Haven’t listened yet, is that the Texas kid killed by some punk who deliberately started the whole thing?
Instead of demanding justice, his dad immediately cucks. Gods, what shame he brings to our people.
Wtf has happened to us? (You all know the answer.)
Still, to be fair, every blatant race murder brings the same statement. I am hoping that he was coerced to it, as apparently were all the rest. That just builds the sense of anger and injustice we need.

        Pre-ideological thought started with a realistic conception of human nature and the implications of that nature for the arrangements of human societies. Ideological thought tends to reject the idea of human nature or believes that human nature is malleable. All the absurdities of ideologues stem from this rejection. The actual situation of humanity makes all the pretty dreams of the ideologues impossible. The utopias they believe they can engineer on earth always end up as actual dystopias of one sort or another.

True. But isn’t the act of abstracting from the specific to the general a leap of faith? Lord knows “science” screws this up constantly. Coffee causes/cures cancer, etc.
Why trust reason to have successfully generalized when we reject reason for anything else? Why embrace the uniformitarian assumption that what is true today will be true tomorrow?

                The use of reason tells you one can’t make a utopian silk purse out of the sow’s ear of human nature. People are hierarchical, discriminating, and territorial and always have been. There is no reason to think this will change. The best we can do is take some of the harsher edges off this situation. That is never enough for the ideologue. He never tires of making the perfect the enemy of the good.

        Realism and pragmatism are ideologies, of a sort. Their conceit is that they purport to be “fact-based”, but even the most dispassionate analysis will eventually run up against Godelian incommensurabity, and contradict itself.
Perhaps the least “ideological” world view is Trumpian transactionalism. Everything is an exchange of value. No moral considerations exist outside the deal. Ethics are determined by adherence to its terms, as creatively as one can manage. It’s basically Semitic mercantilism without the “chosen-ness”.
Not the best code to live by, but not the worst, either. We all can’t be Warriors.

        Off topic here but … The Bessent interview with Tucker Carlson has a good segment where he talks about how the Washington Post slandered the person he personally hired to come into Treasury and go after waste, fraud and abuse. He discussed how they made up the lies about tamping down the payment systems … …Now, Bezos owns the Post. This is where it gets interesting. Is Bezos going to go back and give his employees an ultimatum to stop the slander? Or, is he opposed to doing these reforms? He was a part of the entourage along with his 70% surgically modified girlfriend. Is he on board? If these oligarchs were on board, just with Musk and Bezos at X and The Post, they could really help the reform cause by getting Post readers to stop reading lies.Interesting times we live in.

        Ancient wisdom, acquired over long time spans, is often codified in tradition or religious dogma. Ideology is temporal and derives from current fads and impulses. The latter is knee-jerk whereas the former is time-proven. Once upon a time, knee-jerk impulses got you dead and evolution evolution removed that proclivity. An absence of curative culling has brought this scourge back with a vengeance. Culling cannot be replaced with persuasion.

        What does it mean to have no ideology? Does Z Man really want to say that he has no ideology?
* That one’s actions are not consistent with any principles.* That one responds to problems in a way that cannot be explained by any set of values or rules.* All statements of principles are useless.
We like politician’s who have principles because they won’t surprise us or betray us.Someone whose actions are non-ideological is impossible to predict and so trusting them difficult.
Should we stop talking about our principles? Is politics just about intuition and “vibes?”

It’s a step beyond that, even. If you truly have no ideology, you cannot have principles. Even with the yellow folder thing, you continue the tradition because you believe it works, that it accomplishes some worthwhile end that results in a better outcome than, say, blue folders.

                So it’s a word game, eh?If I say that I accept the Ten Commandments, then that makes me an ideologue? If I say that I support punishing and reducing crime, to the point of calling this support a principle, that makes me an ideologue? Contrapositive of your statement:if you have principles, then you have an ideology. I assume you are a lawyer, and as such you are familiar with the wordcasuistry.Z is trying – and succeeding, in my opinion – to distinguish thought governed by inflexible systems of abstract doctrine, and thought based on some mixture of tradition, experience, and intuition. It’s not pioneering; a terrific book on the same theme is Sowell’sVisions of the Anointed.And no, it is not about yellow versus blue folders, and you know that. It’s about Chesterton’s Fence. For all you know, blue folders were tried back in the day and yellow envelopes proved better, easier on the eyes, or something.

                    Because the chief distinction between tradition/religion and ideology is organicism. Why is organic superior to inorganic? Because the former is empirical and time-tested while the latter springs from the febrile mind of asoi-dissantgenius who may just as easily be a madman, and his ravings have no preexisting contact with reality.

Seriously, though, are you using organicism as I use it? Treating, say, society as though it were a living, ordered system?

                I get what you’re saying but I think you’re still missing the mark somewhat. It’s very possible for “organic” theories and religions to be flawed and untrustworthy — e.g., Aztec human sacrifice, the Hindu casts system, Polynesian cannibalism, etc.The conservative believes in “organic” norms, mores, and cultural traditions because they have stood the test of time and are the product of generations of accumulated wisdom. But I think that’s only true of a society, like the West, in which the cultural norms were created by intelligent people who had some kind of a system to question and examine things rationally.I would say that “ideology” is a synthetic, manufactured, post-industrial phenomenon that exists in modern, mass societies, whereas “organic” cultural norms evolved in premodern, pre-industrial societies (which may be either complex premodern societies like the West, or primitive premodern societies like the North American Indians).

                    That’s kind of cheating, though, isn’t it? If ideology has to be post-industrial, then obviously it has to be a recent development, and noting that fact a trite tautology.

                    Possibly. However, it just may be that the organic cultures of Central America, India and Melanesia produced the best possible outcomes for those people given the quality of the human capital. Horrendous and horrific by Western standards, but nevertheless the acme of those people’s capacities.

            Ideology isn’t having principles, or ideals, or ideas, and be guided, within realistic reason, by them.Ideology is to pedestalize one or more “moral virtues” (so-called, and supposed), and smash realism and awareness of reality into smithereens as part of the (supposed, so-called) virtue worship.
Ideology is to will “principles” and ideals to rule over reality, and dismiss reality as unreal whenever there is a conflict or divergence between the two.

                    How, specifically, do we differ from that? Doesn’t DR just assume all black people are carbon copies, all joos are carbon copies, etc.? Is it that they draw the distinction on species, and we on race? And, BTW, libertarians on the individual? That’s a tad arbitrary…
DR is presumably the Goldilocks worldview? Nestled between two ideologies, but not itself an ideology?

No, we believe that most traits are distributed amongst a population on a normal distribution.  Few deny that Thomas Sowell is a smart guy.  All blacks or joos are not carbon copies, but there are statistical tendencies.
Finally, both of these groups are fantastically tribal, meaning that the best will almost always rally to defend the worst of their group.  In this respect, we can treat them as fierce tribes.

                            OK, I get the visceral reactions. But how about if we do the same with Hatfields and McCoys?It’s not that I don’t want to be murdered by a nog. I don’t want to be murdered by anyone. Italian surnames are also associated with death by acute lead poisoning. Irish, in places like Chicago and Cincinnati. How’s about just impaling all the murderers and call it a day? Clean up all the bloodlines.Stockmen know this “regression to the mean” theory is pure nonsense. We select bulls based on their characteristics, assuming they will throw calves with similar characteristics, and, generally, true. We select the best heifers because they most likely had a mother with superior milk production, and are likely to continue that bloodline. We improve herds every year. Granted, it’s by shipping all but the best off to the pack…

You don’t really believe that blacks have assimilated as well as Italians or Irish. I know that you don’t.
I believe that if most people could see what our country would be like without j3ws, they most would choose to not have them.
Which groups assimilate with other groups is necessarily a judgment call on a large scale. There may be a group of whites who like living with blacks in spite of the violence, but they are dwarfed by those who disagree.

                                Regression to the mean is not nonsense.  Bulls may throw out better bloodlines, but do they produce “better bulls than themselves”?  Not the norm.  That’s regression to the mean—more or less in lay man’s terms.  The mean is not necessary the population mean the bull came from either, but a new mean somewhat between the bull and the herd.  Hence a possible improvement over generations of selective breeding.

That’s not regression to the mean. The calves don’t tend to  regress to the mean or there would be no point in bothering with selective breeding in the first place. They are all going to end up back at the starting place in a couple generations anyway.
It’s true they don’t tend to throw better calves than themselves, but that point is there will be exceptional individuals among the next few generations. It’s a ratchet effect, not a leveling.
Eugenics is a real thing.

                                        Still not exact.  You ignore the second part of the explanation.I’ll explain again somewhat differently.  Regression to the mean simply means that offspring from two above average sires, are often better that the average stock that the sires came from, but not expected to exceed the sires, nor expected to be below the average of the population the sires came from.  If fortunate, a new norm can be expected to be carried on by the offspring, but this is neither certain nor predictable in effect.Regression occurs for the 1st generation only as that generation does not replicate the chance (positive error) alleles from the parents.  Ratcheting effect as you put it is far from certain or predictable, but obviously occurs when one looks at the history of breeding in livestock or humans.

                    In the vast majority of cases, this is correct. However, the key tenet of postmodern ideology is cultural relativism, which is the belief that all cultures have their own system of beliefs and behavior and that no system is superior to any other because there can be no common standard to measure them. On the suface, this may seem harmless enough. But the pomoarriere penseewas always to undermine the foundations of Western civilization by comparatively discrediting its beliefs and behaviors.

                    You might be getting at something.  I once called a gun rights advocate an ideologue when he steadfastly advocated no weapons limitations whatsoever across the board.  He imploded.  I believe that’s been my definition ever since.  In that, an ideologue is much like a religious fanatic.  There is no compromise nor meeting of the minds nor any mutual understanding to be reached, much less agreement.

                        But doesn’t that also make you an ideologue? If he starts the bidding with all weaponry, even CBN, but secretly is willing to compromise to A-10s or M-240s or M242s, and you are not…?EDITI get that the M242 and the Phalanx are scary, and probably have no reason to exist outside of war, but, still…

                            Maybe the best understanding of the word “ideologue” is that it is relative to each person who uses the word.
When someone says, “X is an ideologue,” it means that the speaker believes that X’s theory ignores unchangeable parts of human nature.

                            No, I don’t see the analogy.  My argument would be that one man should not possess such power to cause mass destruction as with an explosive device or missile with such attached—as men are subject to derangement and madness.  Nukes are under multiple military/civilian men authorizing such use for example.But this was not a Trump era art of the deal, only an admonishment that some sort of weeding out of oddballs might be a path to pursue as that many massacres have shown individuals (in hindsight) to be oddballs.  Many countries do not authorize possession of firearms without public approval of such people from their community at large.Such was immediately seen as a threat rather than an opportunity to remove prohibition by States and cities where permits are issued by the police chief to his cronies and law abiding citizens can pound sand.

Normative statement. No different than Wilson’s, other than in degree. Wilson truly believed that if all countries were democracies, the society/world would be a better place. Why would you champion your position other than you think it would result in a better society?

            I have wondered this as well.  Perhaps since, as Zman has pointed out, libertarians are not serious about the use of force.  All governments stay in place because they are willing to violently defend themselves.  Libertarians are self-limited in this regard, because by their own ideology, they must allow freedom to the subversives that will eventually overthrow them.  So hit a libertarian, and his lack of response proves the limits of his ideology.

        Regarding the timing of the onset of Western ideological fervor, during his ill-fated attempt to invade Quebec in 1775 Benedict Arnold – in his journal and his letters to Washington and others – constantly talked of how the Quebecois would rise up and join the Americans against the British, would see them as liberators because of the allure of “liberty”.  It’s uncanny how much his words resemble those of the neocons heading into their sundry GWOT misadventures.

            In fairness to Arnold, it made sense in 1775. The Quebecois were a “conquered people”, living under “the yoke of British oppression”. Except, as it turned out, there wasn’t much oppression and quite frankly when the starving and half-frozen remnant of Arnold’s “army” turned up on the edge of town, laughter and pity were probably the main emotions.

        We All argue based on assumptions – even when these assumptions are unconscious or denied.Call it religion, call it ideology – the name doesn’t matter: the point is that to made progress in life, we each Need to become aware of our own assumptions.Only after we have become aware of them, can we decide whether we really want to have the assumptions we actually have.This is important; because often people discover that they don’t want to hold the assumptions that they are implicitly (unconsciously) arguing-from. Or me may discover that some of our assumptions contradict each other.This kind of self-discovery is Far more important than constantly arguing over “issues” and “policies” – arguments that never get anywhere.

            Perhaps. But I suspect 90 percent of adults are entirely incapable of the sort of introspective self-examination you suggest. And of the 10 percent who are capable, a sizeable percentage of them are uninterested.

                        I don’t think anybody can know whether they are capable. The fact is that extremely few people will try. This, because thy do not acknowledge that the entirety of what they “know” depends completely on these assumptions.Almost all of our culture, including the prestigious philosophers since the 19th century – is dedicated to denying the validity of “metaphysics”. All attention is given to “facts” and “pragmatism”. Scientists (I was one) say they have no assumptions and that their beliefs are rooted in facts.None of this is true, so our errors are intractable, and debate goes nowhere at all. Until people are really fed up with this utterly hope-less situation, they will not consider the reality of assumptions.

        The part that I can’t wrap my tiny little brain around is that while I agree Wilson’s “safe for democracy” and Bush’s spin on it, bombing the world to do things our way, were definitely ideologies, I can’t see why we have a dog in the fight with Russia/Ukraine or Israel/Gaza. How is having principles that insist on imposing your views on someone half a globe away any different than what Bush did?Z explicitly mentions Africans having their own way of working things out. I think he probably wisely avoided the tar baby. Though the tar baby deserves at least a little private reflection, methinks.

        News all sounds alike because they all buy their national news feed from Associated Press. Since they’re all reciting from the AP feed, they say the same things, word for word. No coordination required, just a lack of national reporters (which would cost a lot more than the AP feed).You can tell a low-budget operation because they instead buy their feed from United Press International.When I was DJ’ing, I read many a story from the wires of UPI, because as a public interest radio station, we were required by law to carry a certain amount of news, and UPI was a lot cheaper than AP. (We still had to buy our own teletype.)

        I took Z man’s advice and readRed Plenty. It’s an amazing and unique reading experience. Upon listening to today’s podcast it is easy to understand why Z enjoys the book so much. The book demonstrates how “applied ideology” worked – or failed to work – in the post-Stalin Soviet planned economy. And not due to the lack of sharp people with noble goals, who really wanted the system to work for the benefit of the masses, but due to the paths that could not be taken, that were closed off by actually-existing socialism. It seems that the one unthinkable variable, and thus excluded from their algorithms, was market-based pricing. That the price of goods should develop independently of planning, on its own as it were, was disallowed by the ideology itself. So there could be years when shoes were cheap but you couldn’t buy eggs, or socks…

        I’m gonna go to this Billy strings concert and keep an open mind (having already opened my wallet) but rather than being a positive sign I would say Billy strings is a sign that any popular art is totally dead at leastinAmerica.Billy strings seems to be. Walking corpse:  hid original songs are bad, sorry to say, they are boilerplate bluegrass/pop. He’s good at psychedelic bluegrass. He’s good at bluegrass, and that’s great but while his voice is good too it is not original and great instrumental solos get boring to me really fast. Dave grisman was better than this guy 30 years ago.ill probably get some snickers for  praise of the following artists but guns and roses, Jane’s addiction and neural milk hotel were at least original.  Dave Mathews (I know I don’t dmb is kinda worn out) had an original voice; axel rose had an original voice , Perry Farrell ( not his real name) had an original voice. All those bands  had a totally new sound AND  great original material. All Billy strings does is covers.  Even the  Grateful Dead had good original songs. I havnt heard any great original songs from strings. It’s all mediocre country.what was the topic?!?!

        “At least Stalin was honest what he was up to..” Sorry Z-man, but that’s just complete bs. Yes a thug who can decide to send you to the gulag on a whim does instill fear to follow or else, but he was never ‘honest’ about anything, just like the modern Eurorats and D.C. Just like him, they are ideologs, so how can you ever be honest about your true intentions?Also,  in a 100 years, Americans will have the same hate boner for Israel as Polish and Baltics have for Russia so again it’s just the reality of the situation, as you said about the Congo having different values to Vermont.

        I think it is fine to be a realist, using reason to the best of your ability to decide what ought to be, what ought not to be, what’s possible or impossible etc. It would never be the motivating principle of a large political movement though. Using reason to navigate the best information currently available I am not bringing any news when I repeat the truth that most people are motivated or even driven by other aspects of their minds. It is unreasonable not to accept this. It is reasonable to find ways to exploit it to help achieve the political goals. In the end, the conflict between seriously divergent view points on how society ought to be run is only ever resolved one way, always. Our side will need as many people as possible to know in their hearts, not their minds, that the enemy is evil and the differences are irreconcilable. There is no compromise to be arrived at with people so degraded and disgustingly perverse, cruel and tyrannical they barely qualify as human. The enemy appears to be well ahead of us in understanding this truth about political power and have been painting us in those terms for decades. Our advantage is that it is objectively false about us but objectively true about them.

        Shouldn’t the title be ‘Idelogy and I’?

        Compare these two songs. While footprints isn’t great poetry its not bad, and it’s at least sweet and there some sentimental mystery about what might have happened when he found her; (smooching?)Strings just filled in depressing boring words to a stock country progression and solos over it.Now some might object, Jane’s addiction and gnr have disgusting lyrics too. But their sound was original. Strings is not. I even think the melody in footprints is better.Fkatt and ScruggsNow some folks like the summertime when the they can walk aboutStrolling through the meadow green it’s pleasant there no doubtBut give me the wintertime when the snow is on the groundFor I found her when the snow on the groundI traced her little footprints in the snowI found her little footprints in the snowI bless that happy day when Nellie lost her wayFor I found her when the snow was on the groundI dropped in to see her there was a big round moonHer mother said she just stepped out but would be returning soonI found her little footprints and I traced them in the snowI found her when the snow was on the ground…Now she’s up in heaven she’s with the angel bandI know I’m going to meet her in that promised landBut every time the snow falls it brings back memoriesFor I found her when the snow was on the groundhttps://youtu.be/XHCHcq1qBeU?si=3R5JAPBnE8nhYrwvBilly stringsI ain’t slept in seven days, haven’t ate in threeMethamphetamine has got a damn good hold of meMy tweaker friends have got me to the point of no returnI just took the lighter to the bulb and watched it burnThis life of sin (life of sin) has got me in (has got me in)Well it’s got me back in prison once againI used my only phone call to contact my daddyI got twenty long years for some dust in a baggieWell if I would have listened to what Mom and Papa saidI wouldn’t be locked up in prison, troubled in the headBut I took that little pop and sucked until my mind was spunI got twenty years to sit and think of what I’ve done…Well sometimes I sit and wonder where my little life went wrongThese old jailhouse blues have got me singing this old songMy life is a disaster, Lord, and I feel so ashamedIn here where they call by a number, not a namehttps://youtu.be/wkUGDYjYgMs?si=tj8_U29TG9rbxRS9

            That’s it, that’s it, that’s the good stuff. Ma and Pa resting on the mountain, in a bare-dirt windswept grave, with scrubgrass for flowers and a wailing moon, that sort of thing.

        Yes, you are no ideologue. You are a prophet, as manifested in the “Back to work” post from yesterday, where you make a long, powerful list of anticipations, without expending a single sentence on why what you know is going to happen will take place.
Why is the “global bank” and “global reserve currency” game approaching its expiration?Aren’t still all other countries quite visibly afraid of the USA, and its hundreds of world-financed military bases?
