        Isn’t Mesopotamia the “Birth of Civillization”?
It was, prior to Islam.  Now it is the “Death of Civilization”.

        I loved it too, all the trees and less morale-crushing homelessness, asphalt, and cars. I couldn’t believe he’d prefer it to Oakland. But then if you’ve got money, which he does, you can live well in the Bay Area and away from much of its dysfunction.

        A friend of mine moved to Montreal last year, met a woman and has a kid on the way. He wants to move back here to the Bay Area but I’m telling him he hit the jackpot, living up there, especially with an intent to form a family. But hey, he hates the dark cold weather. Too bad.

            Montreal is one of my favorite cities. French Canadians can be unpleasant and Acadians are mostly dimwits, but there are much worse people on earth. The winters are tough though. I don’t mind the cold, but I have my limits.

        “It’s why you don’t see a lot of complexity in places like sub-Saharan Africa or Mesopotamia.”
Isn’t Mesopotamia the “Birth of Civillization”?

        Yeah, I was one of those kids hustling shoveling jobs in Bethesda, circa 1960. Good day’s wage and extra bonus points for no school.
The town police in some New Jersey burg ticketed kids a couple days ago (white kids) for shoveling snow without a permit. I joke not.

        I live in a certain Midwest city which will remain anonymous. I work downtown in an area that is full of bottom feeders of various species such as drunks, heroin addicts, crackheads, deadbeats, chronic homeless and disability check recipients.We have had a few inches of snow and cold weather this week. Those who have cars in this hood have largely not left the house all week. The cars are buried in snow, slush and ice. My dear wife shamed me into shoveling our driveway on day one of the storm and we haven’t missed a slick. As Bob Dylan sang in “Idiot Wind”.. ‘you’re an idiot, babe/ it’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe’
