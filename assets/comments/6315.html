        a republican and despised democrats but I have found this campaign quite interesting. Watching NT implode right alongside TNR is delightful. They got rid of their best in previous years and are making do with the chumps that are left.Your blogpost was delightful and probably the only time we’ll ever see the line, “attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion”, in a political context. Great imagery without drawing a picture of the difference between those who have and those who can’t.

        Interesting reaction from the average liberal audience in that bar when listening to Trump speak.  It’s clear now that the boffins at NR have no use for “the base” except as hewers of wood and drawers of water.  But remember the Romney campaign: who were the people he swore to champion?  “Entrepreneurs”, right?  Those were the people the Republicans claimed were the backbone of the country – the creators of jobs.  Is there any sense of how THOSE people feel about Trump?  Because they should understand better than any of us how life works when you run a business.  All the stuff you have to do to push the rock up the hill, as you say.  I’ve read that the Chamber of Commerce types don’t want Trump, but who are they, exactly?  Are they the small businessmen the Republicans say they care so much about?  Or are they the types who’ve already got theirs and don’t want the status quo that works for them upset?  If the Republican establishment can’t even hold the support of small business, they who are they really for, except themselves?

        The choice isn’t between men of theory and men of action.  Men of action are men of theory, as well.  The primary difference between the people you’re talking about is that the men of theory aren’t willing to risk their own money on their pet theories, while men of action do on a regular basis.  The men of action theorize as well and are brave enough to risk failure by acting on those theories.This is also why Trump is so popular, while the talking heads are  not.  It costs nothing to run your mouth and it’s particularly irksome to hear from these people how generous they are withyourmoney.  The people you’re labelling “men of theory” are so obviously cowardly, snivelling men, traits that are obvious to all and are repulsive to all.

        &gt;Trump may as well have been talking about attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion.&lt;&lt;
But that&#x27;s *exactly* what he was talking about. Don&#x27;t you see? In the end Roy Baty wanted to justify himself, and he did so in terms of his experience. To Deckard Baty is just a vicious killer, but he has his reasons and justifications for what he has done.
Trump has seen attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I have, although from an entirely different distance and perspective. I suppose other people have too and that&#x27;s why they support him.

        Men of theory, men of action.
Reminds me of a phrase rattling around in my mindset about truth and reality – reality is when a theory meets a brutal gang of facts.
Another good read.

        I hope you won’t mind a German point of view on this topic as I find the whole American political arena fascinating. It seems to me the significant difference between Mr. Trump and any other candidate of either party, is the simple fact Mr. Trump (love him or hate him) has actually worked for a living his entire adult life.Whether or not you agree with his business, his business model or how he has managed his personal finances, the point is clear to most; he’s actually worked for a living and understands the value of a dollar. All the others are politicians who have historically proven that while they may know what work means by it’s text book definition, no one believes have never actually done it themselves.Keep in mind politics doesn’t really require any tangible results to any bottom line other than the bottom line of getting elected and maintaining office. Other than that, everything they do, say or propose is theoretical (and most often a lie anyway) and any attempt to prove their theory is done at no risk to themselves and with other peoples money (or lives, as has been the case of middle-East intervention).As an engineer myself, we all know theory only goes so far. Until you put the ‘rubber to the road’ as you say, one has no proof anything will work. And, unlike politicians, people with a business background understand return on investment, especially when it’s their money (and not tax dollars) that’s at risk and their ability to keep their job is measured by the effect of their decisions on the bottom line by the CEO or board members.Unlike business owners, politicians have proven they are accountable to no one. The mis-deeds of Mrs. Clinton are clearly proof of that. Had she been charged with similar offenses in private business, I think we all know how that would have turned out. Our own Chancellor Merkle, with the recent immigrant debacle, may be unpopular for the moment with most Germans, but it’s clear she and her cronies don’t give a damn about the results of this new theoretical social experiment.

            Agreed. The difference between Trump and the other candidates as well as his detractors in the self-identified intelligentsia is precisely that he has operated in the real world of actions and consequences and they have not.

            I agree. The only people who have less real world experience than politicians are the so-called academics. Yet both groups are telling us what to do all the time. Trump has made it clear that he’s one of us, not them.

        Reading the comments on Trump stories, I see two camps.
I’m in a third camp.   I don’t like Trump, but I’m hoping he straps a bomb to his chest and takes himself out along with both parties in one big bang.
Edit: Ah, I just now read the post below this one.

            I never cared for Trump’s act, but I never had anything against the guy. I’m just watching the show and I have not really thought too much how I would vote if it came to it. I live in a one party state so voting is mostly pointless activity.
