            Indeed. I learned so much from his writings and podcasts, too. Will always be grateful for this.
Very sad news.
RIP Z Man.

                    Ramzpaul was on twitter confirming it, the lack of a friday post seals the deal, unfortunately.
We’ve lost a giant of a man.

                        Lack of his regular Friday podcast will be missed, as well. I’m sure many of us listened every week.

                            Today, Zman would probably be discussing the Big Beautiful Bill’s imminent passage and what it means for the country. While Fox and CNN will send normies down rabbit trails, Z would discuss the inner workings and machinations of the ruling class going on behind the scenes. He had an eloquent way of bringing clarity amid a sea of noise and wonderful knack for getting down to brass tacks.Anyone know of such a blog as this? Not entirely a rhetorical question, but one of genuine desire to connect with the few who think like we do. If so please message me below oron x, though I rarely visit that site.JackCharlton777 at protonmail dot comRIP Zman, you are greatly missed.

                    I did my part, now we need some follow-up from others.(Berkeley Springs, WV is in Morgan County. If he lives in another county, please correct me.)This is what I wrote to the Sheriff at : MorganSheriff @ morgancountywv . govI urge you to take a closer look at the death of Christopher Zeeman and to have an autopsy conducted.I don’t want to sound like some conspiracy theorist, but there have been a lot of suspicious deaths of people in the media responsible for “wrongthink.”Chris was a right wing blogger with a fairly large following and he was “out there” on the edge in terms of his opinion pieces. His works were starting to get a lot of traction with the “wrong” people, i.e. people who are a threat to the established order. (People who don’t buy what the powers that be are shoveling these days.)It’s not out of the question that there was some wrongdoing involved here and there is a fairly large community that deserves a definitive answer.Thank you for listening.

                        Much like Jonathan Bowden in the sense that he apparently died just as he was breaking through so to speak . . . Maybe its all on the up and up but I hope that there is an honest investigation.

                            Exactly. We didn’t know his health issues, but given everything that has happened in recent history, it is not unreasonable that we are very suspicious of foul play.
Enough monkey business has been going on in our government that we deserve transparency.

                        I also have a bad feeling it could be foul play to kill a central and growing node in the networks of those unwilling to abide by slavery and forced extinction. Just my two cents.
I also hope a similar site is made. But it won’t be the same without Z. This is a genuine shock, I think to all of us. Let’s make sure we don’t lose the big fight. I think he would have wanted that more than anything. SMH (damn!!)

            This is a truly monumental loss and it’s still so shocking.I had the honor of meeting him a few times and we had occasional email exchanges. You didn’t have to meet him in person to know what an extraordinary man he was. He really was a cut above. We all came here each day for a voice of reason in this dark, crazy world. An effort is being made to contact his next of kin. Additionally, there are many in our community who would like to pay last respects and a ceremony in his honor will be coordinated.Last week, I sent him an email to thank him for all he does and wish him a happy WV Day. He responded on Sunday and I wanted to share his response with you. He refers to the recent retirement of John Derbyshire.“I must confess that I was a bit melancholy when John retired. The reminders that you only have so much time become more poignant as you get older.I may have over done it a bit on the first day of the heatwave. I was only out for about four hours, but I feel like I ran a marathon. My people are not built for this hot weather. That said, it is nice to be outside without the threat of rain. I’m hoping the heat kills the damned gnats. The state bird of West Virginia is the gnat I think.”Z

                Thank you Melissa, in the days to come as we try to find a new home for the ” house that Z built “, you may be very important to the effort to make  that happen.It sounds as though you maybe our best source of information on the ground there, please continue to share what you know.Nothing is certain at this point except the knowledge that everyone here wants this forum that Zman started to continue. Hopefully the future will include this group of thinkers sharing their take on world events and the human condition. God bless all who dwell here.

                    Thank you Melissa. Any other relevant information you can share is appreciated.
Sounds like he might have been heatstruck with a delayed reaction. He felt bad enough to mention his ‘marathon’ in his note to you, so that is suggestive of really overdoing it on the yardwork.
He doesn’t seem like the kind of man who’d complain much about physical things.  I never heard him even mention his physical condition or problems.

I think that I’ll hit the VDare conference (assuming that they hold it this year) if for no other reason than a sign of respect.

                                Melissa,I’d like to help make sure this website stays archived and online. If you can point me to any contact or family member, it would be really helpful. Otherwise, the domain will expire, some web-bot will snatch it up and put spam on it, and all links pointing to the site won’t load the original content. An archive is good, but preserving it on the actual domain is best. If you could be of any help, please email me at remolish (at) protonmail (dot) com.

        Some are asking where we all go now? I say we should disperse and spread dissident thought to all the normies in our real lives.
The Socratic method is best. Hide your power level at first and just keep asking the right questions so they eventually reach the correct conclusions on their own.
Also write blogs, post blabs, join podcasts and do all you can to keep spreading thought online.

            No.  Do not atomize; dissipation will follow.  Find another leader who will host a page and continue on.
Z’s page was powerful because of his breadth of knowledge and experience, yes, but also due to the shared potency of community.  THAT — not the individuals — is what the Woke-Fem Politburo feared, and fears still.  Individuals are easy to pick off.
They already are celebrating Z’s demise.  Don’t make it easy on them.  Rise up again immediately and continue on the attack, redoubled in memory of friend Z.

        My sympathy is with all who knew The Zman, either IRL or on the innerwebs.
This is my last post as Jeffrey Zoar, a screenname I made just to post here. If you see a post by Useless Eater, that could be me. Or my Substack handle, Martin Castillo. Been an honor shitposting with all of you here. Best commentariat on the internet. I don’t expect to see its like again. I certainly didn’t see its like before.

                    Indeed.  Maybe I’m mistaken but wasn’t it you, Citizen, who once commented here that your stock assertion to those offended or puzzled by your refusal to embrace the cultural orthodoxy is “I want what’s best for my people”?  And that when you’re asked to identify your people, you give the disarming reply “I know them when I see them”?
I can’t tell you how the Zen-like simplicity of that phrase has percolated in my mind, matched only by Z-Man’s “Because we live here.”

                        When considering doing roughly what Z did, we must also consider the possibility of doxxing. Apparantly this happened to Z, but fortunately didn’t affect his livelihood. But anybody who is vulnerable to doxxing needs to think very hard about venturing into the online political commentary business.

I will miss reading Chris’ amazing, thought-provoking essays. Fridays will not be the same without his wonderful podcast, many of which made me guffaw.

            All of that and thanks for the information. This blog was unique and almost certainly a one-off. It really puts a hole in our lives even if we didn’t know Z personally. I don’t expect ever to see another forum that appeals to me anywhere near this degree. Chris is a type we see too often now–a remarkable mind, atomized in his personal life, and someone who should have been known by far more people than us.
Just gutted.

        Despite never having met the man, I felt an immense kindred bond with him.  Every morning the first thing I’d do is open his blog and read the post.  I was a green door subscriber and would seek out all of his appearances and guest spots.  It is a stark reminder that life is for living.  Be with your loved ones.  Spend your time with people worthy of your time. It can all go away in a flash.

            Z-Man would often mention, when the temptation was to become bitter and immiserated at the world we’re forced to live in, that life is to be enjoyed and that you should never allow yourself to take things too seriously.  It’s sound advice.

        Oh my god, no.
Chris was a good man. He reached out to me and offered words of consolation when my brother died suddenly.
I cannot say this enough, Chris was a good man. A very good man. Beyond politics, beyond understanding, he was kind, decent, and caring.
I cannot tell you what a loss this is.

            Good Whiskey, a short message beneath your lengthy comment down below.It is not consolation – there is none – it is something you should know to expect. Something will happen – and it will mean everything.

        I was hoping that somehow there’d be a new article today &amp; the claim that Z passed wasn’t true but here we are.Rest in peace Z-Man, I read your site for well over a decade, feel like I knew you even though I didn’t, not really. Gonna miss you like I knew you though. I won’t forget you, man. There’s no one else who could ever compare to you, you were a titan in the pro White space, they broke the mold with you &amp; nobody will be able to fill the void you have left. I’m glad I was around to experience your blog &amp; interact with you firsthand. My understanding of the world, what led us here &amp; what we face would be extremely limited without you…For the vast majority of you who’ve been commenting for years I always enjoyed reading what you had to say. The dynamic between Z’s articles &amp; the comments made for some very insightful &amp; oftentimes fun reading &amp; I doubt I’ll ever get to experience anything like that again. Like Z always used to say, the quality of the commenters on here was on another level. This blog wouldn’t have been the same without you here. Just wanted to say thank you all for that.Also, for everyone I interacted, laughed, commiserated &amp; shared stories with, those who debated &amp; challenged each other’s beliefs with, who were kind, acted in good faith without pretension or condescension, thank you especially. You know you who you are.I’m going to miss you all just as much as I’m going to miss &amp; mourn Z-Man, this site wasn’t just a blog to read for me, it was a little community. I count myself lucky if I get to have my grey matter put through a workout more than a handful of times a year in real life just due to circumstances &amp; lack of intelligent, honest &amp; thoughtful people. It was cathartic coming here &amp; I’m forever thankful for that, for what Z &amp; you all provided.Thanks again to Z-Man for everything, you’ll never be forgotten.Stay safe &amp; stay sane all of you.Farewell.

            I am crushed.  I feel as though I’ve lost my home, been cast into the void.  What an enormous loss – and he had only just escaped from Baltimore and started making a life in West Virginia.  I never had the privilege of meeting him, but felt I knew him nonetheless.  May you rest in eternal peace, Zman.

                I know, I’m still not really absorbing it. Its surreal. Still don’t want to believe it but if I didn’t comment now, by the time I did eulogize &amp; say goodbye I doubt anyone would be around to read it, its going to take that for me to process this gut punch.

                        Didn’t really think about how woven into my daily life he was until this, its a real shock to the system. Always had his work to look forward to &amp; then *poof* just like that, no more. The gravity of it hasn’t even begun to set in yet, in hindsight the amount of times I’ve opened my browser on my phone &amp; hit the Z key then enter key on my keyboard to check the homepage is astronomical. Its muscle memory, I didn’t even think about it, I could get to this site on my phone blindfolded I’ve done it so many times.Its like pouring a cup of coffee every morning but then one day there’s no coffee &amp; never will be again.

                            We liveremote by choice, and yet via fiber optic internet I’ve been able to continue my daily reading/interacting on Zman’s site without a hitch.  So many other sites have disappeared, or I’ve moved beyond them (with Zman and commenters’ help), or I’ve been banned from.  Nowhere else with the breadth and depth, and history of Western European thought.
And yes, I share Ostei’s feeling of intense grief for someone I didn’t truly know.  I weep for Zman’s passing and the void he’s left behind.

                                “or I’ve been banned from”I laughed at this, many such cases.

Didn’t want to have to take an eternity to commute to work but its looking like thats whats coming in order to avoid subhuman Whites that are a precursor to africanization.If I didn’t have wired internet I’d have to have a landline because there’s no service here at all, I route all my calls through wifi because the nearest signal is a fifteen drive away.My whole life was like living at a klan rally &amp; Amren conference up until obama’s second term, thats when the deaths of despair really started kicking off. Now barely anyone I know is like me &amp; I seldomly get to see or talk to them. Every year that passes my world gets smaller &amp; more alien. Obama &amp; then biden through HUD housing set into motion the destruction of what remains of the suburbs &amp; smaller urban sprawls. The major congo city where most of the work is has been claiming territory forever steadily creeping in, could always move further away from it but now its a free for all.Reading Z &amp; the comments &amp; chatting here was a respite &amp; now its going to fade away. So very sad losing Z the community he built up in one fell swoop.I could’ve never predicted it would be so sudden like this.

Sometimes life sucks &amp; yes the world is a dark place &amp; theres not only nothing with admitting that but denying it is exactly how things spiraled out of control to this point.
You just inadvertently demonstrated why this place is so special with this comment, anywhere else the comments would be inundated with insulting bromides.

                                Per this, evidently his last essay, it is not. The world is completely incapable of choosing any action, so by definition, cannot choose to be cruel. It is merely indifferent.

                                    That is not quite what I meant. My point is that our world is bound by metaphysical constraints that ensure a considerable measure of misery for all sentient creatures. Consequently, a great many, but not all sentient creatures lead more or less cruel existences. Saying we inhabit a cruel world is a figure of speech that obliquely captures a great deal of truth.

                                        Hi Ostei, my sympathies. I am devastated logging on today. I almost died myself last week while hospitalized. From my mostly bedbound existence, The Z Man blog and its’ astute commentators were my daily read, and solace. While regaining consciousness, I realized that during my life time, the world has not known peace, and it saddened me. The Z Man explained why. I’m also a big fan of Moon of Alabama, LewRockwell.com, UNZ.com. I come across the same commentators, always a joy. Yes, we live in a cruel, yet heartbreakingly beautiful world. Ostei, although I have never commented or replied to you before, thank you for your comments. Especially today, your words stand out.

                        But we DID know him, through his ideas. Which is why we feel such loss. Perhaps we knew him better than the people who surround us physically and with whom we exchange mundane and banal pleasantries, but never truly “know.”

                            Excellent point. And I substantially agree. But all of the articles, podcasts, etc. cannot quite subsitute for sitting down with a man over a couple of pitchers of beer. The facial expressions, the body language, the voice inflections, and the unpredictable ramifications of conversation are an essential part of truly knowing somebody. So, while I knew Z-man, I didn’t quiteknowZ-man.

                            This is a great point XMan. We did know him because we saw how his brain worked and heard his opinions on virtually every topic. And I’ll be damned if there was one time where he didn’t make me think and rethink my positions. Even when I didn’t agree or wish he’d go further, I could only marvel at his ability to articulate ideas. So yes, I think you’re right in that many of us were, despite never meeting him in person, closer to this man than we are to most of our “friends.”

                        Truer words. I just stumbled onto this horrific news. Z was an extraordinarily eloquent voice and a crystal-clear thinker. I’ve never cared a whit about any public figure–even a minor celebrity, to borrow his phrase–I did not personally know, but this is quite different.

                Z was moderate, measured and intelligent with an incredible enduring capacity  for engaging and communicating his thoughts in writing especially. His writing and the many similarly intelligent and thoughtful commenters here were / are one of the few remaining web information vehicles I deliberately expose myself to. I don’t comment as much as many regulars here but I read everyday and I also hope this house that Z built can endure somehow. Rest in Peace Z.  AMDG

            I haven’t commented in 3 years but came back when I heard the news. Still listened to his podcast weekly. Starting coming to his blog after he snagged me from Sailer’s site in 2015 or so (iirc).
This is a tremendous loss.

                I found him via Vox Day of all people around 2013, mentioned him in a stream thats now lost to time.Didn’t start commenting until I became a commenter refugee from all the censorship purges. This was the one of the only places that wasn’t rife with schizo tier cope posting &amp; wasn’t flooded with cult of personality MAGApedes when internet censorship was cranked up to 11.I wish I was more diligent in commenting &amp; replying, my life has become increasingly chaotic over the last few years so oftentimes I would just catch up reading everything at the end of the week. Even when I did post I often would get caught up with something else &amp; not come back in time to see the replies before people moved on.Its a reminder to never take anything for granted, we always miss the good things in life when they’re on their way out. The loss of Z is going to leave a colossal void in the pro White space.He was a routine part of my life, that’s an emptiness that can never be filled by anyone because no one was like him. The same applies to the commenters here, this place had by far the highest concentration of intelligent &amp; quite frankly kind people out of any political site I’ve ever frequented.I may not have known Z or the people who commented on a personal level but the sense of loss is nonetheless profound &amp; the feeling of emptiness that I know that will follow Z’s passing is very real.

                        Your guess is as good as mine. What I said about being a refugee didn’t just apply to me, ever since the shift to labeling anyone who doesn’t think men can become women a nazi every other place I know of got destroyed.If you go look at the comments of any random Unz article now its a mental asylum, still good people there but its demographically changed for the worse.Twitter you can’t type a paragraph without having to pay &amp; hand your personal information over to israel so they can dox you with all the consequences that brings with it. The nature of the site makes it all about being clever, its fast food for commenting.Even before the censorship when a site like this went down people scattered despite many of them making an attempt to keep the fire burning somewhere else, its just the nature of the beast. That specific phenomena aside obviously just having somewhere to comment that’s halfway decent seems beyond reach at this point but I would love more than anything to be proven wrong about that.Other pro White sites with comment sections that are niche tend to be pretty bad from what I’ve seen &amp; thats really reflected in the figures themselves. Z was unique in who he attracted because he was so distinctive compared to the rest, why I’m so doubtful there will be anything like this again. This place was an utterly hostile environment for the dishonest, primitive &amp; mentally deranged that are so common everywhere else.If anyone has an answer to Yak’s question please do let us know, I’m not trying to be cynical here but I have to be realistic. I’ll be checking back to see &amp; read everyone’s comments periodically throughout the rest of the day.

I don’t recall you posting much to this page, there, GCM.  But all of a sudden — now that you want Z’s stuff transferred to Teddy — all of a sudden why here you are, deeply Concerned About the Z Man.
Like to slap you.  Mebbe later.

Just because I rarely commented didn’t mean I wasn’t a regular reader.  Quite a few posters here have come out and said the same thing.
Like to slap me, huh.  Because I merely stated it’s not about you, it’s about the Z-Man?  Not a good look on your part.

                    I suspect I read some of his comments a long time ago at NRO – and probably clucked my tongue at them – but I found this site, astoundingly, when it was included in the morning link round up at Ace Of Spades, a blog that promotes a brand of conservatism that most of Z-Man’s commentariat find distasteful.

                        I don’t know if Z had mods to approve comments or if he alone did that but in case it never gets approved (I don’t even know what I said to trigger the comment being blocked) wanted to say thanks for sharing. So many great things I discovered was due to randomly stumbling onto it like that, I was lucky to find Z so early but I would’ve eventually because, particularly after Trump won, so many pro White figures started talking about him &amp; his work.Having said that, thats a pretty wild way to find him &amp; end up becoming a devoted reader lol.

Much the same.
Never had the sense that Zman was ever in “cope” mode.  Or “grift/buy my out of copyright books” mode.

        With Z-man’s passing, a scene and line from the movie “Blade Runner” comes to mind.
Roy, the dying clone, meets his maker Tyrell.  Tyrell comforts Roy wrt his short lived purpose coming to an end with the line,
“The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long – and you have burned so very, very brightly…”
And so it is with Z-man….
Goodbye, Z-man, and goodbye to all of you in his commentary group.  May we all meet again somewhere, someday.

        Lord, that was a punch to the gut, what with Zman posting his columns with clockwork regularity.
The loss, if I may be so selfish, is compounded by the demise of this forum which has been a great source of inspiration for me, even if I’ve been rather remiss with my participation this last year or more.
Godspeed to you all and I hope we’ll meet again out there on the battlefield but if not: it’s been a privilege.

        I find myself mourning not only Z and the end of this blog but also the death of blogs. 5 years ago there were blogs I could go to for my bad thoughts fix. Z’s was the last.Heartiste gave up when his blog was Shoahed by WordPress. Dahlrock retired his. Roosh gave his sites up to live a private life after being censored and becoming a Christian. TDS and AA have been completely demonetized and censored to the point that AA recently threw in the towel. Z was one of the last blogs standing. There is still Moon of Alabama and Sonar21bbut but they don’t have near the scope of Zman and TDS.the other wrong thinkers are being herded to X and Substack to get an audience and make money. At X, ones who notice the JQ are already being demonetized and shadow banned. Once democrats get in Substack will come under attack. Besides every institution eventually becomes converged.In my more pessimistic moments I feel that we are seeing the last flickers of independent thought before total darkness. But the future is always different than we think it will be.

            The darkness of New Amerika assuredly hates independent thought, and independent men most of all. These forces are evil, not stupid.I am v suspicious about z’s sudden death, as I was when Marc Angelucci, attorney of the National Association For Men, was murdered in 2020. I do not buy the FBI’s story about Marc, who was the heart and soul of NCFM. When did the FBI start speaking the truth? lolI feel the gloom falling on New Amerika, a nation whose leaders and citizenry selected the dark side long ago, choosing to abide with lies and self-serving sinister purpose.If the darkness does fall, do not be deceived that all is lost and this is the end. It is not the end; humanity has a great and glorious future ahead. The enemy within will not stop that future, only delay it.

                    Yes I do know some LE people, and some political people, from my years living in the U.S. I had a career that caused interaction with such folk.As for LE generally being the ‘good guys’, it is vanishingly rare as they have become enforcers of Feminism and Woke. Or they don’t keep their jobs. Far as I am concerned, that constitutes collusion with the enemies of God and country.I left New Amerika almost a decade ago and have no wish whatsoever to return and be falsely accused and falsely imprisoned, as I was before. That bitch cuntry can rot in hell, and her Empowered Ones assuredly will lead her there.The people in my adopted country respect me, and some even love me. Exactly the opposite of my time in the U.S.Gonna have to find somebody else for the investigation.

                    Anglin can be entertaining, but that’s because he’s a contrarian comedian, so he tends to not be a very deep thinker.

        Jesus Christ… I hope this isn’t true. I fear it is if RamZPaul said it, though. What a loss. What a great community of dissident thinkers we have here. What a great service to intellectual freedom and free speech Z has provided.The people here, including (especially) Z are some of the most intelligent, thoughtful, incisive, and well-informed people out there.Without this page I am going to feel an emptiness that is not going to be filled any time soon. Thank you all for being my mates and thank you, Z for providing this place of intellectual refuge.But if this is indeed true, Z is truly “in a better place”… maybe we will all join him there someday.

            If it’s indeed true, and I’m still holding out hope, we do need to discuss where we’ll be migrating. Ramzpaul? Pete Quinones? I also look forward to reading the members here, and without Z and this community, I’ll definitely feel a hole in how I digest this crazy world daily.Secondly, people in the community need to start archiving and saving all his work before something happens to this website. His life work and commentary are far too important to the cause to just lose.

                Ten year listener and occasional commenter. Absolutely floored by this. First thing I read almost every morning. Our side just could not afford a man of such character, intellect and energy. It’s impossibly rare that one human is actually indispensable. For a people struggling against near Satanic human evil, this one was.i do hope there is a way to capture and preserve his body of work. I fear the forces of darkness will quickly move to destroy all memory of him. I’m not a technophile, and I can’t begin to guess how his memory and work can be saved … before the hateful move to expunge him.  If someone has any perspective on this, please illuminate.If we can persevere, he will be remembered as a giant.

        I’m in disbelief. I want to think that Ramz’ account has been hacked and this is some prank.I was planning on attending a conference with Z Man because I wanted to thank him in person. I guess now I won’t get the chance. I have followed him for years and at some level I feel like we’ve lost a family member. He was instrumental in opening countless eyes, and we owe him a massive debt of gratitude. To be able to crank out thought-provoking essays for years took a phenomenal mind. It feels weird that you can think you know someone who you’ve never met, but this feels like we just lost a brother.In addition to the monumental loss of Z Man, a talent I’m afraid cannot be replaced, there is the realization that this blog is no more. And gone with it, the excellent comments and group that’s been cultivated over the years. This is a devastating loss, and I feel strange feeling that way, but that’s what it is.Good bye to you magnificent bastards. I hope to see you if the revolution ever comes.

        Oh my.  Rest well, Chris.  I think I’ve known the guy close to 20 years.  Not in the hanging out over beers kind of way, but they a lot of us know bloggers…through our work and our sharing ideas.  A lot of the stuff we talked about there made their way into his new blog.  We got purged in 2016 (Trump!) and took great joy sharing the cratering of internet traffic at Con Inc. websites.We were among the very first unmoderated commenters (the coveted gold star) at National Review Online.  That was around 2005 on Disqus. I still remember when he launched this blog.  And in so doing, helped me put oars in the water to this dude of the river, as he put it.  The way he deconstructed the system at NRO is where and why I coined the term you all use today: Conservative Inc.  Yeah, I named it, but I credit Z for helping me figure it out.  That and a lot of other things.On long road trips I still listen to his back catalogue of podcasts.  Finding a way to preserve those will be important.All last week I kept asking the Endless War bots at Conservative Treehouse, “And then what?” as MAGAs over there were trying to fend off all the Israeli worshippers who had suddenly flooded the comments.  I didn’t get a chance to ask him if that was a pull from my comments or say thank you if it was.  But that entire “Then What?” column this week I felt like it came from there. And I know he followed CTH.  I like to think so, and I used to bring a lot of his columns there.It’s so strange to hear about someone passing who you’ve followed for 20 years but never met.  But I’m glad he escaped Lagos for the countryside.  It seemed like he enjoyed his final days there with his cats and some well deserved peace.RIP, Z

        I’m gonna eulogize here as well. In my adult life I have normally hopped from writer to writer, eventually “getting it” and tiring of him before moving onto someone else.I have been a regular reader of The Man since 2017 (Derb pointed me his way) and have never gotten tired of him. Ever. He always made me think. I am blessed that I found ZMan and grateful to God that I wasn’t given a normie brain that stops at George Will and David Brooks, and ZMan’s influence will stay with me and all of the commenters here for the rest of our lives.

What a bummer. ☹️
I’m here every day. I love Z, and I love the bums here in the comments to. A lot of you guys are as sharp as he was. Even the raging arguments and food fights were great. You could crack a rude joke, or debate with men and women that actually THINK.
The zingers alone were worth the trip. Godspeed, Z. And best of luck to all you guys too. We have very big shoes to fill.

                There’s the saying I heard from VD that engineering is science you can trust, because it has to work. I’d say philosophy is like science in that way, although I’m not sure what would be analogous to engineering.

                    My degree is in philosophy but my career was in electronics and software.
So I’ve lived in both worlds and can affirm that engineering is more satisfying insofar as it leads to results which undeniably work or they don’t.
Philosophy, on the other hand, never satisfies precisely because it never reaches any final conclusion.  There’s always another “Yes, but …”

                        True. In philosophy there is no progress. Plato died around 2300 years ago and yet his arguments have not been supplanted. Plato is every bit as valid right now as he was when he was alive.

                        For a student of philosophy you’re giving it rather short shrift. The foundation of philosophy is doubt (in sharp contrast to religion) and it’s the most general kind of thinking available to us. When we approach some new area of phenomena and are completely clueless, we start with feeling and intuitions, doubts and conjectures, which gradually crystallize into a philosophical framework. If the framework is useful, it gives way gradually to science, which involves both more formal reasoning and more quantitative empiricism. And this serves as the foundation for technology.Philosophy in the sense of doubt, of swirling conjectures, of speculation, characterizes much human activity. When a master mechanic looks at a malfunctioning car engine and strives to narrow down what could be wrong, various hypotheses will be going through his mind and he will attempt to test them. Likewise for a physician attempting a diagnosis. Likewise for a computer programmer trying to figure out what’s wrong with a complex program.The problem with modern philosophy is it has become a meal ticket for professional academics who have a vested material interest in nonstop chatter. The racket of professional academic philosophy is what pays their mortgage. This nonstop and overly technical, vacuous, obfuscating, and inconclusive chatter is what turns a lot of people off.

                            I do value the way studying philosophy taught me critical thinking.
In my previous comment I was using the word “satisfying” in its literal sense: the end of desire. I.e., finality.
P.S.,I am saddened to learn of ZMan’s passing and am somewhat selfishly wondering where we will go now for conversations like the ones I’ve enjoyed here on his blog.  Like philosophy, those conversations never seem to reach any settled conclusions, yet I feel compelled to keep going regardless.

The comments section is exceptional. If there was a topic of the day to write a comment on and expand on we could have something worth reading and thinking about. It would be nice to keep the commentariate together; it is a gifted group of thinkers on here.
This is a sad day. RIP Chris. Gone too soon.

                        Yeah, kind of funny that applied philosophy isn’t much of a thing. The abstract is what I love about science and philosophy, but they aren’t much good if they aren’t made practical. Maybe that’s why philosophy has waned.

            I’d say it depends upon how far one goes in Philosophy as a discipline.  The introductory courses at the undergrad level are, in my opinion, useful—as they have roots in everyday life.  For example, Logic.  Fallacious concepts in reasoning, and therefore argument, surround us.  A survey of the ancients wrt philosophy and reasoning also proved useful for me in later life.  Indeed, such readings were not in those days restricted to the dept of Philosophy.  Humanities required reading about the death of Socrates as written by Plato.  I still to this day am inspired by Socrates behavior in his situation.Of course, I was blessed by attending university *before* the death of the universally required “Western Civilization” curriculum in American institutions.

                I learnt a fair bit from philosophy myself. Around 500 BC, there was the birth of abstract reasoning with the pre-Socratics. Good, evil, the nature of reality, the ideal form of governance — all as abstract ideas. And as abstract ideas we need to discuss and define what they should mean. This is why, from a historical point of view at least, Plato’s dialogues are interesting. Other than the ancient Greek philosophers, I learnt a fair bit from Kant’s “Critique of Pure Reason,” which is analogous to an intensive gym workout. Among modern writers I’m smitten with Magee’s “Confessions of a Philosopher.” As postscript add Pirsig’s Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.”

                What I know of Logic and the ancient philosophers I learned studying English literature – taught in high school by an older lady from West Virginia, and then in college by long-time professors, not the then new leftist ones who now rule over the ruins of academia.

                    Much of the modern stuff is garbage and shouldn’t be dignified by calling it “philosophy.” Also many people acknowledged as 20th century philosophers, whom I just don’t think are that great — Russell, Ayer, Rorty, any number of others. After the revolution of Kant, philosophy became problematic.Sorry, again adding as a postscript (I’m in the middle of cooking my next meal). Texts on logic and rhetoric will sharpen your thinking, allow you to distinguish more clearly between meretricious and sound arguments. Which reflects the ancient antagonism between teachers of philosophy and teachers of rhetoric. As far as I know, Aristotle was the first to enumerate and describe forms of sound reasoning, though Aristotelian logic gave way over a century back to symbolic logic, which morphed into today’s mathematical logic. This field is much more technical and extensive than anything Aristotle could have dreamt of. Which reminds me that Bell and Machover’s “A Course in Mathematical Logic” is one of my favorite texts. Though I see Manin has a more recent book. Still, I must pay homage to Aristotle as the founder and forerunner, just as mathematicians pay homage to Euclid, Pythagoras, and Diophantus.

                            Oh, but it is a skill set. In the same way that sophists used to teach students who were contemplating a life in politics. Do you want to be a skilled demagogue? Or perhaps a good trial lawyer? Sophistry, rhetorical devices, philosophical arguments — these are all weapons to manipulate.

                    I had wonderful instruction in literature and analysis of fiction during the early eighties, at a budget state uni. in . . . waaait for it . . . California!  :O)In both my professional and avocational lives their teaching provided endless benefits — not that many of their students, even in those years, took advantage of their expertise.Nearly all the faculty were white men, and nearly all passionate and sincere about their sub-field.  Eager to be my guidance counselor.  Ready to arrange a co-op ed internship.  Now, doubtless, the place is a warzone for the Ebil Ebil Whiteman Debils.An excellent education at a working class college.  I am still grateful.

        I thought I’d share with everyone an email he sent me a few months ago.  I asked him how the heck he cranks out so much material and holds down a career, his answer:“Whenever anyone asks about writing, my first bit of advice is something I read in a biography of William Falkner. He wrote two novels in the style of the lost generation that was popular at the time, but they did not sell. An editor suggested he write about things he knows and cares about. The result was The Sound and the Fury. He spent the rest of his life writing about what he knew.In my case, I stick to what I like and I write for myself. I am the only audience that matters. Every day I write an essay to myself about whatever is on my mind.The second bit of advice is to write every day like it is a job. I get up every morning knowing I will write for an hour or two. I think if I retire from the day job, the schedule will be write in the morning for a few hours, then go outside and do chores. Have lunch and write some more in the afternoon. Audio and video will be evening things. That way, I have a routine.As far as how I write, I just start writing about something and let my mind wander as I do it. More often than not just typing it out leads to either a bigger idea or, sometimes, a totally new idea. I keep a list of ideas that pop into my head, but the list just grows and grows, so once a month I read through it and trim it back. A lot of my ideas turn out to be quite silly or even stupid.I know a guy who writes fiction and his method is to write in a way that will describe the person he has in mind. Therefore, the plot and scenery serve to explain the character, which leads to coming up with creative setting for his characters. If I ever write fiction, that is how I would go about it. Treat the characters as puzzles to solve by placing them into situations that reveal their nature. I like reading stuff like that.I do very little editing. I run it through Word, but that is it. Instead, I set limits. Short sentences, short paragraphs and about 1000 words in total for a post. This makes for more reader friendly copy and keeps me from meandering. I went to Jesuit schools and they always told us, our writing should be like a woman’s bathing suit. Long enough to cover the important parts, but short enough to be interesting.In the end, the best place to start is to just start writing and see where it takes you.Z”Perhaps it will encourage others to writeCFO

            If I recall, Z-man offered a strategy for his daily writing some years ago. Limit your essay to 6 paragraphs or perhaps less, each paragraph to 4 or 5 lines concerning a single aspect of the topic to be expressed. I may be off in the exact numbers, but you get the picture. Often, when folk chided him for this or that which he “overlooked” he harked back to the formula he used and the difficulty of keeping the topic succinct.In his later years, he expanded upon these numbers—especially the number of paragraphs per essay—but with the accelerating deterioration of the world as he saw it and complexity of the subject matter at hand, who could fault him?

        I tried to start this poost a dozen times. Gawddammitalltohell. Like many of you I come by every day.The bums in the comments are as good as our Esteemed Blog Host. Serious men, serious commentary on serious issues. The zingers back and forth were worth the trip alone. A lot of times I pooped in the comments but I also just sat back and let the faster, smarter kids talk.The best tribute I can leave for you, Z,  is this: you changed my mind. I’m a retired stubfart, who doesn’t matter, a former economic asset… now a distinct liability to The Blob. Truthfully – I don’t matter one iota in the scheme of things as many of you have noted over the years. It’s okay – it’s part of getting old.But Z took the time. I seriously mistunderstood him several times, and he’d slow down, haul out the colouring books and the finger puppets for the old retard… and show me what he was thinking and why. He got seriously pissed at me too but that’s all good… he listened. He was a gifted talker AND a listener. That is exceedingly rare these days.Godspeed Z. And to you guys as well. I suppose this site will go dormant and we’ll go our separate ways but when we all came together here… we were philosopher kings. Maybe we’ll meet again at the other haunts and sanity enclaves?Cheers, fellas.Filthie

        Z Man would’ve been a force in his 60s in the DR. He had a comprehensive view of mainstream and dissident right-wing politics, and the ability to articulate it in speech and the written word that was unique. His importance would have grown as the years passed, because few could speak with the depth of knowledge of where we have been — and where we should go — as he did.It’s incredibly sad. Just yesterday I was listening to the interview that he did with Ramzpaul and the anonymous fellow with the expertise on Iran. ZMan at one point talked about how he was “just a little boy” during the Iranian Revolution, and for a moment, I tried to imagine what he was like as a child and how interesting adults must have found it to talk with him. RIP.

        I suspect this message may not post, as I have never participated in this forum, but I’m giving it a shot. I’ve been a reader and listener of the Zman for several years. He has been an incredible teacher to me with a profound breadth and depth of knowledge that is rarely seen. It would take me a lifetime of dedication to even attempt to replicate it. Perhaps other efforts are underway to preserve the legacy of his work, but without confirmation of such I fear the loss of this website may mean the permanent loss of the bulk of Zman’s work. I intend to archive this website, the podcast, and any other collected works by the Zman that I can uncover. If anyone knows of other efforts that are underway, has ideas, comments, suggestions, or feels this is inappropriate please let me know. I just want to do something to honor the Zman as I learned so much from him. He is dearly missed by many.

        I have never been sadder at the passing of somebody I had never met. Like most of us, I only saw his face recently after he came out of the shadows. I commented here infrequently but read his post everyday. He was my morning coffee mate. There was no other site on the internet that I read the post and even the comments everyday. This is a great community and I love the idea of keeping it going in another form (The Z Hive?). Or compiling a collection of his essays for publication. Feeling like I lost a friend today. Rest in peace my Z friend.

        I have spoken to the King in case the rumor of Z’s death is true.  I have no fears for his soul.However, I do have many doubts if his death is confirmed.  He was posting and podcasting regularly, and then suddenly, adios . . . from ‘natural causes’.  He made no reports of illness or impending death, so for me this is a hmmm.Yes ‘natural causes’ do happen sometimes, but I am VERY suspicious as Z was a leader of men in what is a real war with the forces of progressivism, feminism, and related satanic movements.  There was NOBODY on the internet that hit harder, nor any site with a sharper commentariat.Then the guy just suddenly disappears, and I guarantee, if he was my kin I’d be all over this and blotting for fingerprints.  The enemies of God and justice assuredly will assassinate anybody who gets in their way.  I am not making any claims, just stating facts.  The enemy is evil and is capable of anything including murder, it is no joke.Great job, Z!  You did good bro.  I’ll see you in the Shining Lands and I’ll be along pretty soon myself now.

            He often spoke of how one’s longevity is mostly tied to genetics and that all the working out and proper dietary practices could only do so much.  And on that note he talked of coming from a family where people lived long lives.
I don’t think there’s anything wrong with having suspicions about this event.  In some ways it reminds me of the very sudden passing of Andrew Breitbart, which was another death that just didn’t sit right.

                Thanks for confirming what I’d *thought* I’d heard and read him say on more than occasion, but could not be sure because, truth be told, I’ve never been an avid reader of his posts, nor an avid listener to his podcasts. Which are all great, don’t get me wrong.When Zippy suddenly and unexpectedly died a few years ago, it hit me like “a ton of bricks,” but I had developed a (online) friendship with Zippy that never materialized between me and Z-Man. Similar with Lawrence Auster, but we all knew Auster was sick and on his “death bed.”Anyway, rest in peace, dear Sir; we are exactly the same age, and you have, for several years running, definitely been a strong influence for the good in my thinking!

        It’s noon on the 27th, and for 12 hours I’ve been searching for confirmation of Zmans death. It appears to be true though not yet certain. No group will miss him more than we do,so I would like to suggest an idea.This is a collection of interesting and thoughtful minds brought together in this forum started by Zman, and it would be a shame to see it dissolve. There are those among us with the talent and knowledge to create a new venue to keep this group together and I hope someone can pick up the baton that has fallen. What better way to thank Zman than to keep his creation alive?

            I wholeheartedly agree. But we need to formulate a plan quickly and then act upon it. Even if it’s just a stopgap measure until we can come up with something more permanent. This site could vanish at any time.
Incidentally, if RamZPaul or Derb is reading this, guidance would be appreciated. We must all hang together.

                I am not a tech-savvy guy by any means, but I might do that Substack thingy just to provide all of us with a temporary landing place until we can formulate solid, long-term plans. But there’s no sense in me doing it if nobody is going to show up. If you’re in favor of me doing this let me know with a post or, at minimum, an upvote.

                    I’m very much in favor of that Ostei. I’m not tech-savvy either, but this isn’t the time for this group to drift away.  We need to have a place to congregate.

                    I’ll show up. And donate. Ostei Kozelskii, for what it’s worth, I always really enjoy your comments. Your insight, your humor. You’d make a hell of a writer to help pick up the mantle. We all know that our beloved Zman can never be replaced, but it would be a shame for all of this to simply go away.

                        You’re far too kind, Winter. If I do this–and I’ll begin investigating the details very soon–understand that my production would be quite a bit smaller than Zman’s. I’m working a full time job, and also a part time job that is actually a writing gig, so my free time is limited. Nevertheless, I could crank out the occasional piece and do some administration. And, of course, contributions from Tradissidents such as yourself would be not merely welcome but necessary.Most important of all, however, the place would serve as our personnal bar and grill where we could rant and rave, commiserate and console, cheer and celebrate as events allow.

                            I have tried to post a couple of comments expressing my sadness at Z’s passing, but they didn’t make it.  So I’ll try again.  I was not here as often as I would have liked due to my work schedule, but knowing he was holding down the intellectual fort with you and other commenters was reassuring, given the vast wasteland that is current comment sections.This reminds me of that day a little over 7 years ago when you and I and others on here were banished by Mandolyna.  The difference this time is that not only do I mourn the loss of the camaraderie of my fellow commenters, I also mourn the loss of a towering intellect.

                    You may also want to consider setting something up on Gab.  Zman was a long-timer user and a supporter.  He always said that Andrew Torba was fighting the good fight when it came to free speech.   Gab is a refuge for many in the dissident community.  Seems like the appropriate place to memorialize Zman..

What about WordPress itself? If it was good enough for Zman…

                    Agree that Substack would be the easiest way to get a transition point for us. Lot of great interchanges here and it would be a shame to lose them.
I wish I knew how to transition his whole site over to Substack so it could live in memory of him. There is also a way to archive it but don’t know his to do that either.

                        The body of his work MUST be preserved. It must be made available to this movement for review, guidance and study, to assist us in our difficult task, and to help develop future generations of this movement.I believe he has over the years set out the critical points needed if our people are to successfully preserve Western / American civilization. His intellect, character and insight have been remarkable. I think it advisable for a formal (or informal) group to be put together to determine urgent initial steps (contacting NoK / heirs / estate, assisting with conservation of his project etc) and to either initiate or assist in some larger project to preserve and study what he produced.

        RIP Zman!
You were a prodigious, talented thinker and writer as well as a very patient and thoughtful host. Well, except for that time I was being drunk and annoying on Gab and you blocked me, even though I deserved it.
I suppose this is also farewell to what has been the best comment section on the Internet for several years running. I hope I see and interact with many of you folks on other quality dissident sites.

        Typing this Friday morning. Last night RAMZPAUL Tweeted that Z-Man had passed away from natural causes. I’d hoped it was a misunderstanding, but others in his orbit weighed in with confirmation. Terrible news. RIP to my favorite pundit and podcaster.  This leave a huge void.

        What a profound and devastating loss. I’d love nothing more than a handsome hardcover of ZMan’s work gracing my bookshelf, but sadly, it was never written. As many of us inevitably drift apart, I’m tossing around an idea. What if a few of us gathered his finest essays and compiled them into a beautiful book? All proceeds could support a cause we all care about. Just throwing it out there. Thoughts?

            Capital idea. But just know that there could be copyright issues. And, of course, no mainstream trade or academic publisher would touch Z’s work. Maybe Countercurrents? Or possibly a vanity press.

                    I wonder if it would be possible to live stream the service? I’m not sure whether that would be appropriate, but I’m not up on modern etiquette with these things. My first instinct is that it would be disrespectful, but perhaps I’m just old fashioned. I’m not sure my instincts are correct. He had admirers all over the world, surely they’d want some way to pay their respects.Have any other details surfaced? I’ve been googling “death notices this week Morgan County, WV” and “death notices this week Berkeley Springs, WV”, but it doesn’t look like anything has been published yet. Either that or I’m looking in the wrong place.This is a staggering loss. I just realized I’m wearing his Lagos Trading Company T-shirt. It will be a cherished item to remember him by, going forward.

                        it may be possible, although I am not sure the Catholics are too big on filming funerals. but we are working on having a remembrance ceremony nearby
please followhttps://x.com/FriendsOfZmanrun by his Boston friends, for information about a service, and some pics. we are trying to make it happen on or around July 10 in Berkeley Springs WV

Somebody maybe should call the Sheriff and try to convince him that this is worth a closer look.

                    The root of all humor is truth. He was a pied piper and he assembled a following that had to shake the powers that be to the core. Not to mention that it’s an easy drive from DC. It’s not completely out of the question that somebody decided to nip a potential problem in the bud. (Seems like it would be pretty easy to do something to his well water.)

                Late to this thread, but I said that Caitlin Clark should skip the WNBA and play in Europe after she left Iowa.  The pay in the WNBA is better but she’s paying way too high a price.

        Although Z Man’s blog primarily focused on American culture, politics, and problems, it was also widely read by dissidents from the Old Continent, like myself. Unlike Europe’s far-right intellectuals, Z Man was not a philosophical rambler — he had the ability to condense and clarify even complex issues.In Finland, some of his writings were translated on the alt-right websiteSarastus, but unfortunately, the translations ceased with the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. My homeland is a one-truth country, even among dissidents. As a result, I and my blog became dissidents among the “dissidents.” I regularly shared Z Man’s ideas both on my blog (Yle Watch) and on social media, and I noticed they received a lot of positive feedback within the stuffy and conformist “alt-scene.”Z Man’s death, therefore, does not affect only Americans but also Europeans. By any measure, he was an exceptionally sharp political analyst in the entire Western world.

        I first learned about ZMan when he was on a Myth of the 20th Century podcast in 2018.  He was always brilliant and thought-provoking in addition to being one of the wittiest writers on this scene. What a legend!  I’ve been heartened to see the huge outpouring of support here and on twitter.  God bless you ZMan and thanks for everything you’ve done for the dissident community.  RIP

Such terrible, terrible news, a real gut-punch. Zman, thanks so very much for everything…the commentary, the insight, the laughs. I still don’t want to believe it. You have no idea how very much you will be missed. I wasn’t a frequent commenter, but you were a big part of my life. Rest in peace. You made a huge mark on the world and won’t soon be forgotten.

            I’ve had a substack for 6 or 7 months now.  It is not set up for group commentary, just a solo site.  I started it because my physical condition is no longer conducive to, well, much of anything anymore.  lol
I also have 20 years of essays on my old wordpress and blogger sites.  Dunno if folks here are interested or not.
I will publish the addresses here later unless there is an objection.

        Unbelievable.  If true, I’ll be the first arsehole to ask the question:  did he ever admit to getting the jab?  I know a couple oftimes he mentioned on his Friday Power Hours in 2021 that he was considering getting it if he had to for air travel.  Some here may not agree, but the jab has killed thousands, maybe tens of thousands.  Maybe not the best time to rip off this bandage, but needs to be at least considered.  Or perhaps it was his three essays earlier this week (M-W), all very critical of our greatest ally.  I guess we’ll never know.  RIP, Zman.

            “…really hope someone with the skill and time can archive…”Time for men to be the someone, yes?It is not hard at all — I am right now copying the “Theory of Everything” pages.Use the free app,https://www.httrack.com/I have used it for YEARS — super simple. Glad I did as pages I used for research disappeared .. so having them on my machine, priceless. You just copy and past the URL, and it does the rest. Choose a local folder.If you are tech savvy enough to be beyond AOL, you can do it.Not to poke you personally, it’s just my pet peeve, ‘someone has to do something!’

        Good Lord so hard to process this. I knew something was wrong when the usual Friday post was missing.The Z Blog was often the first and always the most thought provoking blog I would visit any day.I know I am repeating what others have said but no one else said things as he did. He had a healthy skepticism and had me think of things in a different light. In fact I believe I’ll go back and reread My Theory of Everything.Some people are irreplaceable.Rest in Peace Z Man.

        Sorry for additional sorrow, but i just thought of something that brought me even lower. Z Man never finished his book. I always thought a book would be the best tool to help ease those dissident curious across the great divide. Referring someone to the site was good, but you have to stick with him for awhile before it illuminates some things. At least that’s how it worked for me. A printed book would have been like the Book of Eli in the future GAE dystopia. I’m not sure how we collate all these essays and save for posterity.

            A few years ago I chose about 10 Z-Blog essays that I really liked, printed out several copies of each (by pasting the text into Word so that there was no identifying marks), compiled them, and then stuck them into random mini-libraries near me, including one at the nearest college.  I don’t know if they were ever read by anyone, or if they caused anyone’s head to explode, but I’m going to do the same thing again.

                        Probably the hardest working pundit, full stop.
Somehow contacting his next of kin would be important as a step in preserving hisoeuvreincluding perhaps this site. One wonders how much they knew about his political writings and if they approved or disapproved. If only there was some way of getting the username/password for the Zman account.

I am no lawyer, tho I worked with plenty of ’em,but I expect a signed release from next-of-kin would be sufficient to access and publish his works, as long as it was not for-profit.
I don’t think anything of Z’s has been copyrighted, so that should simplify the matter.

                    It’s devastating. He had such a vast knowledge and brilliant mind.In person, he was kind and funny. His greatest regret was not having children, but he reached out to young men on this side of the great divide and was a mentor and resource to many.It is absolutely heartbreaking.

        If we can figure out those rules and then figure out how to impose them, man will be liberated from the oppression of having to live against his nature within a hostile set of rules.
The State Legislature finished its six month session and passed 400 new laws.  One would think after two hundred year, the State would have the rules, figured out, but if 400 new rules are needed every six months, then paradise is a long way off.

            Much of “new law” has little to do with restricting behavior.  More to do with reelection and politicking of duplicitous pol’s.  I’ve had that argument with some and never *won* the issue.  Another reason to simply not vote for these people.

                    “Ever more elaborate looting requires ever more elaborate legal protections”I’m talking much more simplistically (pragmatically?) than that.  For example, we most often see a law proposed to “strengthen/harshen” penalties for a crime/behavior *already* prohibited under law (as just about every human behavior is already criminalized to some extent in our present society). Pol’s particularly love to pass such laws as it makes a good campaign hangout come next election.So my immediate reaction is to ask simple questions wrt such a statue change: 1) How many arrests have been made under the old law for this “crime”? 2) How many convictions have been achieved by these arrests? 3) How many recidivists have we arrested and convicted for the same crime?Almost always, we find that the original crime is not enforced, or rarely enforced.  So how can increasing a penalty be effective?  First order thinking here unfortunately prevails.

        This is a complete shock, needless to say, and I am deeply saddened. I think I first saw Z as a commenter on Sailer, and I’ve been following the blog since the very beginning. I didn’t always agree with him but his breadth of knowledge was stunning, a true Renaissance man, and I was awed that he could write a compact, readable, insightful post every weekday, plus the podcasts. And I was occasionally puzzled and annoyed that someone so learned on so many subjects could so badly mangle the pronunciation of certain names. And the comments here intelligent and articulate, unlike in so many places on the interwebz.Thanks Chris. RIP

            Brandon:And we have become a community. He brought us together.So the quesiton remains: where will we be able to join together, once this blog is taken down?  (Area Ocho, Art Sido, RamZPaul, Pete Quinones [tho he doesn’t have a robust comment section like this], or Big Country? All of them are great, but none are the same.)
I made several IRL friends from this blog comment section. And went to AmRen because of Z Man,where I madeeven moreIRL friends.All due to his mention of the conference.

        I have no idea why, but this feels like an absolute gut-punch to me. I never met the man, but his podcasts and Sunday shows were such a treat. It may be because he was so young, and I’m approaching his age.

            When your time’s up, it’s up. I’ve known people who died in their early 40s with heart problems, and other who carry into their 80s with all kinds of medical issues. All the great sages say that living in the moment is what you have to do.

            Assuming it really was natural causes, I’d surmise a massive heart attack. They can happen without warning. That’s why, upon reaching the age of 50 you should get a thorough cardio checkup. I did that several years ago. If I hadn’t, I’d probably be dead.

                    I wonder if he ever had an arterial scan to check for blockage. Then again, if there was major blockage you’d think that would show up in the form of hypertension and a labored heart that would be audible through the stethoscope. But I’m hardly an expert on the subject.

                I think he overexerted on a very hot day and suffered heat stroke, but did not recognize the symptoms and thought he was just very tired, as he reported to a friend.  Then he went to sleep without addressing any of his symptoms and still suffering from heat stroke.
That’s a bit like going to sleep when one has a severe concussion, without remediating the symptoms.  Might wake up, might not.

            He, like many older Right-Wingers, seemed to be skeptical of the medical profession. I wonder if he should have treated something that he blew off because of the skepticism we all have of big pharma. I am not criticizing The ZMan at all, just putting a situation forward that we all have to face from time to time.
I have the urge to eschew doctors forever and abandon the goy meds, but sometimes submitting to big pharma might be worth a few extra years. I don’t know. Every man can choose.

        This is truly a sad day.  I went back and read Z’s “theory of everything” and it kind of brought a tear to my eye.  When I first discovered his website, I read all that stuff, just to get up to snuff, so to speak.  He was an intellect to be sure, with the ability to make his thoughts and essays totally readable and understandable – I never had the impression that he was ever just mailing it in.  The volume of worthy content he created was astounding.  I almost feel like I’ve lost a close friend or family member.  God speed and rest in peace, Z.  You will be missed more than you will ever know.

Goddamn. Really, goddamn. RIP, dude. Hope the road laws in heaven are just and you’re still riding, lest I kick your ass on the poundway. FFS, this is a sad day.

            It’s true. It’s a crushing loss.Once I learn of any funeral arrangements, I’ll share the details.He often referred to himself as a hermit in his fortress of solitude but he was warm and gregarious in person. He was not only a brilliant, he was personable, thoughtful and funny.May he rest in peace.

                            I wish I could. This week, I adopted my neighbor’s two cats. My neighbor was placed in a nursing home and left her two cats behind. Now we have four cats and a dog.His ocicats are beautiful and seem really sweet. They are so attached to him. It’s so sad to think of them in the shelter. If you or anyone else has any ideas, please let me know. I can pick them up from the shelter and transport them to their new home.

                                    Gunners,That is really nice of you, thank you. They are Ocicats. They are beautiful and have dog-like personalities. They are amazing cats and very attached to him and to one another. They would need to be placed in a home together as they are siblings.Let me know if you are still interested. Tonight, I spent nearly 2 hrs on the phone with an Ocicat breeder who went into great detail about how wonderful they are and that they will be highly sought after if posted on PetFinder, etc.

                                        Thanks Melissa for the quick reply. I will let you know ASAP. We have one cat already, so two more may be too much, but will discuss with the family.
RIP Zman. I will miss this great blog, and so sad I never got to meet him. It is so weird that I saw his face for the first time on RamZPaul’s show last week, and now he’s gone. God bless this heroic warrior for truth. He will be immeasurably missed

                Melissa, do you think there is any chance of getting access to any unfinished work of Z’s?  I assume he’s got a large chunk of his book in draft form.  It would be too valuable to let lie fallow.

                        I hope he did but I worry he may not have.He seemed so sturdy and youthful. I worry it may have been heatstroke. He had been spending hours outside working and we’ve had unbearably hot weather this week.

                            I was doubtful about that, since he appeared on RamZPaul’s show the evening before, but it seems that the effects can be delayed by several hours.  This could be Monday morning quarterbacking, and they did have a third guest who did most of the talking, but when watching the show yesterday, before I heard the news, I thought ZMan seemed subdued.  Perhaps he was dealing with the after effects of a couple days working in hot, humid weather.

                                I thought he seemed a little off as well. Almost like he was in over his head( I know, impossible.) It was a great guest though and maybe Zman was just giving him the floor.

            Me too, I’ve read more this week than I have in awhile. What am I going to do ? Watch Ramzpaul ring a a cow bell with his strangely dyed hair every time someone sends him 50 bucks ? I would email Zman every few weeks. I thought about a topic suggestion today only to be shocked once again that he’s gone.

            Nice.  I was mulling duplicating his blog on the off-chance it disappeared but Peter Brimelow mentioned that it looked like chances are good a way will be found to keep it up permanently.  I hope his “green door” stuff is duplicated over to here though I did copy his movie reviews down (haven’t posted them yet though).

        I held off commenting because I kept hoping that the reports were not true.  It’s unusual for a man of about 60 to die suddently, although it does happen.  If I recall correctly, the Z-man only said that he was slightly overweight, but that the men in his family tended to die young. In his case, it was far too young!  Z-man was part of my own journey to what he termed our side of the great divide.  I remember one time in I think it was 2019 when he played the ad from Ronald Reagan’s 1984 “Morning in America” reelection campaign and then said simply, “It’s all about money.” That really grabbed me.  There were other valuable insights but that’s the one I remember best.  Not only did Z-man have a great column, but the comments were of very high quality and I’ll miss all of you who posted here regularly.  So rest in peace in Z-man and know that you made a valuable contribution to political and cultural discourse in the early 21st Century.

        This is sad to hear. I’ve never posted here before, but I’ve been reading Z-Man and listening to his shows on and off for many years, including reading your comments. He always struck me as a sensible and level-headed guy which is unusual in political discussions.
RIP, Z-Man.

        I don’t want this community to end. So in memory and honor of Chris, I have set up a substack to continue the community and offer my own thoughts of the day. I can commit to a schedule of six posts a week. I cannot do seven right now. They will be short and sweet. I have set up now a remembrance of Chris. If anyone has anything to say you are free to post there:https://socalresident.substack.com/?utm_source=global-searchI have a post a day through Saturday in service to the community. My substack is free, no moderation. I can’t control Substack so please use code words for things.I have a post on my visit to Amazon in Santa Monica.A post on the Missile War between Israel and Iran.A post on Gunsmoke as a top ten streamer (not kidding on that either).A post on Happy Fourth of July.A post on Operating Systems for the Dissidents.I want to wish everyone a Happy Fourth, for me it will be doubly sad. But life is for the living, we have a short enough time as it is.

        “If it is Sunday, well, it is Sunday”It is weird and unsettling to not have the Sunday podcast on Substack awaiting on Sunday morning. I tended to enjoy it more than the Friday podcasts as it was half the length and more digestible for my ADHD-addled mind.

        I would send Zman letters and postcards when traveling so he could see the postmarks from weird little towns that I was in.  I hope that gave him a smile occasionally.  Thanks, Zman, for all the brain stimulation over the years.

        I just found out 11:00 pm west coast, I’ve been refreshing the podcast site all day, I’m off from work today.I emailed him this morning. I figured his internet connection was down, his family has a history of living to be well into their 80’s, he’s mentioned that several times. I’m in total shock. I was counting on him being around.

            I’ve been praying for them. They seem like awesome cats though, and I bet the shelter people know they will be adopted to a good home so there is faith that it will happen. Poor things. They dont know what is happening to them. It looks like they are learning to gain trust in other people now somewhat. That’s good.

        I never thought I’d go throughthisagain! On a Saturday evening in 2002 I settled down in front of my shortwave radio for another inspiring American Dissident Voices broadcast, presented by Dr. William Pierce. When it didn’t come on, I was a bit puzzled. A few days later I heard that Dr. Pierce had suddenly died of a “highly aggressive cancer.” After recovering from my initial shock, I began to wonder if he had fallen for the old “Plutonium In The Saltshaker” trick, like what probably happened to Yassir Arafat.And now, this! Another of my dissident heroes suddenly gone! I hope somebody looks into this!

        The Z Blog was one of the first places I landed after being flung out of the mainstream orbit. Though I did once send something other than listener enthusiasm to the PO box, the fact is that The Z Man deserved far more from me than I ever gave him. This is my promise to pay it forward.

        It’s just one of those things you think will never end: zmans daily blog and comment section. I’m glad I thanked him on thanksgiving and not just doing it now, but zman was really my initial contact with so called dissident or far right politics. I think it was zirl science: he made me laugh….then he made me think. I regret not introducing myself at amren when he spoke a few years ago.

        I hope Zman was an operative of some sort and is now on to a new role and further mission. After his Abiyaah posts recently, speaking of 14th century islamic scholars, I imagine him now as a Muslim influencer somewhere in an internet space we don’t, we can’t, even know about. Maybe his work here was done and his beard got long enough 🙂 for his next mission to throw some sense into those who have ears to hear in another part of the world.
Either way, Godspeed. He will be missed. He was unique.

        I was deeply saddened by the passing of Z Man and was hoping one day a “Best Of” compilation would be put out. Since there are around 370 episodes, I can download them one at a time. To archive his blog posts from 2013, an automated method is needed. I asked Grok what command line to use to archive every page of a website and it suggested using the wget program:wget –mirror –convert-links –html-extension -P ./outputhttps://thezman.com/wordpress/I then asked Grok what command to use to save each page with the article title and publication date in the file name and it gave me this answer:wget –recursive –no-clobber –page-requisites –html-extension –convert-links –restrict-file-names=windows –domains example.com –no-parenthttps://thezman.com/wordpress/However, when executed, it kept crashing and giving me error messages so I use the first command. The result was a folder with about 22,000 files totalling 3.1 Gb. When zipped into a single file, came in at 445 Mb. Here are the bittorrent links:Filename:thezman dot com dot zipInfohash v1 link:07e46e94be67fbd416d4c26cb4596cc7ff5de533Magnet link:magnet:?xt=urn:btih:07e46e94be67fbd416d4c26cb4596cc7ff5de533Torrent ID:07e46e94be67fbd416d4c26cb4596cc7ff5de533

Speaking as someone who has watched too many movies and entertained common theories on the deaths of Seth Rich, Scalia and Epstein, if the spooks had given me a warning to knock it off, particularly after his second to last post, my final post might read exactly like this ‘Free Will’ one does.

            You’re not alone.  My one consolation is the voluminous cache of content available here.  There is still so much to discover.  This afternoon I randomly listened to episode 135, from the end of March, 2020.  I probably hadn’t listened to it since that week.  In fact, I remember being so disgusted with humanity during that month that I almost completely unplugged from all media, so perhaps I didn’t even listen then.It was a letters episode and the first letter was from a younger listener, asking the eternal question about what steps we can take to further our cause.  As usual, Z’s answer was measured and cautionary but offered sound practical advice.  Those are two traits he had that kept me coming back: he didn’t default to black pilling and he was able to give realistic suggestions on how to be of service to our side of the great divide.Looking back just a few years, it’s almost inconceivable how far we’ve come in terms of awareness of issues that were once the domain of a small number of dissidents.  The widespread use of the term “black fatigue” in 2025 is something I’d have never predicted just 5 years ago.  And it’s happened via the means that Z-Man advocated, to wit, quietly, methodically, and without the sort of obnoxious race baiting that might have, rightly or wrongly, discredited itself and its purveyors.  Nobody with a public megaphone railed against the black tax, yet suddenly large swaths of the public have become comfortable discussing it.The long-term thinking espoused by Z-Man was equal parts comforting and bracing, and he left us an invaluable box of tools.  The shock of this week will inevitably fade and that’s when we must honor him by continuing the battle using the sagacity found here as our guide.

                I just listened to inside a black vagina and a few salty things or something. Excellent. I guess he got tired of girl science but it’s what kept me coming back early on..  i originally didn’t like the essays but in the past year or so I got sick of the podcasts and only read the blog.  The blog, the podcast and the comment section. Needed all three to make z special.but so much stuff even in those early podcasts. Like tax. He makes a simple point that us whites are really the only ones to care about taxes. So just mocking it as small issue is a mistake. Great point for winning people over.  Also I think in inside a black vagina he starts off in the neocons. An excellent description of where they came from, the purges and the destruction of conservativeism.

        This was truly shocking news. Like Ray, I was at first suspicious, but I’ve seen first hand what heat stroke can do, and it seems all too plausible given the recent weather and amount of time he was outside last weekend. An hour can do that on the wrong day where I am, let alone four.I’ve been here checking blog posts daily since the late 2010’s, and podcasts on Friday since they started. It has been a rare place of clarity, and pure open discussion. As my speed of wit and intellectual heft aren’t quite what they once were, I’ve kept my opinions and observations infrequent and light, but have been in awe of many of the minds here from Z to you all. It kept me thinking critically, grounded and pointing the right direction in uncertain times.I respectfully disagreed with Z’s recent thesis blaming protestantism for modern paganism, yet I recognized the precept and the argument. I think that problem is more nuanced. I also think only Jesus can solve that boggle upon his return, but let’s keep trying until then. That’s remarkably little divergence over the said span. My only other gripe is pining for more Xirl Science in recent years. 😀Godspeed Z Man, and thank you. Well done, good and faithful servant!And to you all- Keep communicating, and be excellent to each other.

            ‘I also think only Jesus can solve that boggle upon his return, but let’s keep trying until then’This. I know I am not going to solve America’s problems, largely because there are a lot of people that don’t want them solved.This war between men and women has been going on since almost the beginning, so I have no illusions of ‘solving’ anything. The restoration of the bond between the male and the female will have to wait upon the King’s return.I focus my efforts on preparing the way for Him, which means preparing a remnant of the people for Him, so when He arrives He won’t have to destroy the whole place, and He will have a contingent with which to begin anew.Howard, please consider contributing to whatever alternate forum the folks here come up with. In these crucial hours every voice for truth counts, and we never know whose voice might turn the dismal tide.cheers

        Humans and angels have limited free will.  Enough to express and reveal their true nature and character during existence, but not enough to ruin the greater patterns of God.  Modern tech, like Babel before it, is challenging heaven for authority yet again.If we had complete free will, there would be no such thing as, for example, prophecy.  Fulfilled prophecy suggests some level of fixed nodes in space-time.  Time itself is an illusion of corporality.‘What we think of as physical reality is probably a simplified illusion of reality’Yes of course.  We get a redacted, simplified version of ‘reality’.None of us could carry on under the terrible weight of full reality.  We are limited to five senses, mebbe a titch more, for good reason.  On occasion, God sends visions, which hint at the fuller reality in which we are immersed.Without the interface of our sensorium, apprehension of complete reality would induce madness and the wish for nonexistence.  The things I have seen, o Lord.Scripture alludes to this with the line about no man seeing God’s face.  Also the part in the OT where God shows only his ‘good side’ lol to the witnessing Moses.

            Very Lovecraftian.As an aside, intentionality is an extremely captious concept. As Z says, the vast majority of human beings, and certainly those in power, must believe in free will. Without this belief, the earth would become an abattoire. Moreso than it already is. However, if you really think about it, absolute intentionality would be a chaotic hell. This is the case because all of our actions would be uncaused. They would be utterly random, with no reason behind them and therefore utterly unpredictable. In such an environment, we would all perish in short order. If reason is causation and thus an at least partial nullification of intentionality, then free will is circumscribed. And this is not only a good but a necessary thing.

            My second question to a dead man was what most people would ask – “What about God?”  (The first was, “Is this real?”)
His answer and another – “Nature is above morality” – and the experience itself, are what neither your kind nor standard-issue atheists can answer, leaving both unsatisfied with the other.
The faithful cannot answer an atheist’s question – “how, exactly, does it work?”, and the unseeing cannot answer a believer’s question – “why did He put me here?”

        Just a FYI: I checked the historical weather record for Berkeley Springs 6/26. It reached a high of 97 but temps had plummeted to the days low of 73 by 9pm, I think that was around the time Ramz’s podcast with ZMan had ended. I know some people were thinking he might have suffered a heat stroke.

            Given the fact that a sheriff first reached out to Peter Brimelow’s wife in an attempt to find a next of kin, there seems to be two options.  One is that he died in his sleep and the inability to reach him that morning (someone involved in his day job?) resulted in a call for a wellness check.  The other is that he began his day fairly normally but collapsed while outdoors and was visible to a neighbor or passer-by, which then resulted in a call to the sheriff.

You actually get cold and clammy when in heat stroke. It is VERY dangerous if it goes unrecognized and untreated, particularly for somebody around 60.
I think Z went to sleep still with symptoms of heat stroke, and his body could not recover on its own.

                    My understanding is that it’s heat exhaustion that makes you cold and clammy. Not the same thing as heat stroke and not nearly as dangerous.

However, some here may disagree with this, but my next favorite single blogger after Zman (not the site but blogger) is Jim Goad, who I fear has also had some health issues.  He’s been incommunicado for six months at his CounterCurrents site.  Anyone here know anything about that?

        Sam Harris is another of these weirdos pushing lack of free will.  He let the cat out of the bag on Rogan that without free will, we can’t really enforce the law, like throwing people in prison.  The other side of that coin is we just unalive them.  Either way, it’s a way to unleash more evil in the world.

            It’s an obvious comeback, but without free will, maybe we can’t help but throw them in prison. Zman’s observation about prescriptive action rears its head again. If believing you don’t have free will causes you to change your actions, then you actually had free will. It’s a very midwit way of pushing your favored outcome.

        I remember reading Zman’s stuff behind the paywall and he was mentioning heart burn while out working.  Probably 4 plus months ago.  At the same time, I follow a cardiologist who had the same symptoms and had a heart attack.  Of course the cardiologist was wowed for obvious reasons.  I suspect Z had a heart attack, but I may be wrong.  I’m Zs age so I walk on egg shells with regard to health.

            The symptoms of heartburn and heart attack are incredibly similar. There were a few times I was certain I was having a heart attack–checked into ER and a clinic–when it was just heartburn. Best way to solve that conundrum is get an arterial scan to make sure there’s no blockage. If there’s no blockage and you experience heart attack symptoms, it’s merely heartburn.

                And if you are ever are sleeping and wake up with a bad heartburn feeling make sure your house isn’t on fire. I almost died thinking half asleep I just had terrible heartburn for some reason. But it was from the smoke. Learned a lesson there I will always remember.

            I was struck by that too. I assumed he felt a little thawing in society. Plus what’s the point he was doxxed. I was doxxed during the summer of love and it is stressful and it never really ends. It may have contributed to his overall health but who knows

        Another thing that might be interesting to do is to collect and centralize interviews that Zman once did.Basically Zman-centric interviews about his thoughts and him as a person.I remember one he once did with Kevin Michael Grace from the 2Kevins show.You’ll likely be able to find it with any search machine, by searching for:“Grace &amp; Steel Ep. 78 – Talking with the Z Blogger”

        This is what I wrote to the Sheriff atMo***********@************wv.gov:I urge you to take a closer look at the death of Christopher Zeeman and have an autopsy conducted.I don’t want to sound like some conspiracy theorist, but there have been a lot of suspicious deaths of people in the media responsible for “wrongthink.”Chris was a right wing blogger with a fairly large following and he was “out there” on the edge in terms of his opinion pieces. His works were starting to get a lot of traction with the “wrong” people, i.e. people who are a threat to the established order. (People who don’t buy what the powers that be are shoveling these days.)It’s not out of the question and there is a fairly large community that deserves a definitive answer.Thanks for listening.

            Your belief in the System, while understandable, is misplaced. Anyone so inclined would be quickly gotten to, like the Hennepin County Medical Examiner in the George Floyd autopsy. And we’re still waiting for the FBI to crack the case of the two near-assassinations of President Trump. Oh, wait, wasn’t that same agency somewhat implicated in one of them?

        I am lukewarm on Sabine. She is a gifted mathematician and scientist…but…Uggghhh.I think we are misconstruing her and our Esteemed Blog Host *may* be misunderstanding her point. Awhile back the fad Theory Of Everything proposed that time is an illusion. The idea was that reality exists as a fixed multidimensional matrix where all our decisions, all our history, all the events in our lives – have already been done and that they are merely just fixed coordinates in an n-space matrix. In other words, the universe has already been born and died, all the outcomes and probabilities have been resolved, and reality exists as a static unchanging unit. Her argument is not one on the nature of man, it’s more a scientific treatise on the nature of reality and our dimensional position within it. If our perception of time is an illusion, it follows that our perception of free will is too.I personally think there’s more to it than that but whadda I know? I’m stuck down here in the third dimension and I dunno if time is a dimension or an illusion. All I know for sure is that it takes an awful big dog to screw an elephant… and that Sabine flaps like a loose gate in the breeze as she adopts and discards the theories that pass in and out of vogue with the tall foreheads and academics.

            “I came here to die with you. Or live with you. Dying ain’t so hard for men like you and me. It’s living that’s hard when all you’ve ever cared about has been butchered or raped. Governments don’t live together–people live together. With governments, you don’t always get a fair word or a fair fight. Well, I’ve come here to give you either one or get either one from you. I came here like this so you’ll know my word of death is true, and my word of life is then true. The bear lives here, the wolf, the antelope, the Comanche. And so will we. Now we’ll only hunt what we need to live on, same as the Comanche does. And every spring, when the grass turns green, and the Comanche moves north, you can rest here in peace, butcher some of our cattle, and jerk beef for the journey. The sign of the Comanche, that will be on our lodge. That’s my word of life.”–Josey Wales

                Pretty good flick.  But‘Now we’ll only hunt what we need to live on, same as the Comanche does’The Comanche were the biggest thieves, murderers, and marauders not only in the SW, but of all continental language groups.  Their women were notorious for the slow torturing of captives, which constituted an essential part of Comanche entertainment, along with horse stealing and burning down shit.Of all North American tribes, the Comanche were the least to ‘only hunt what we need to live on’.  LOL Comanche Nation was VAST at one point in the 19th Century.  They terrified the settlers like no other tribe, and they took whatever they wanted and whatever they could snatch, especially people.  What they did not do was ‘hunt what we need to live on’.Silly Hollywood chose the wrong tribe to deify.  They got it exactly Rong, as usual.

                    Lewis and Clark reported that the plains Indians hunted buffalo by setting grassfires that made the herd stampede over a cliff. They then took whatever they could carry from the mountain of flesh at the foot, leaving the rest to rot.Primitives see Mother Nature as an inexhaustible cornucopia because that’s how it usually works for them; without firearms, they are unable to even put a dent in the stocks, or at least not one that they’ll notice in their lifetimes.The Chinese still exhibit this attitude, especially when it comes to the seas which they look upon as an unclaimed treasure hoard to plunder, grabbing as much as possible before it’s gone.

                        That is exactly right. Despite absurd protestations to the contrary, Sitting Bull wasn’t Rachel Carson and Crazy Horse wasn’t Dian Fossey. They were indifferent to the “moral” nature of the natural environment except to the extent that it provided them with subsistence. If they’d had the technology, they would have wiped out animal populations and scorched their part of the earth.

                            It’s likely they did wipe out animal populations – the mammoth, the aurochs, hastening the end of Ice Age species – and note, there are no large nor useful land animals in South America beyond the llama. Popocahuetetl and Inuwa’eninsee ate them all.

                                There’s still some (diminishing) argument, but yeah, early man (what we call indians) pretty much wiped out all the big animals in the America’s.  It is less disputed that the environment, for example North American forests, are in many ways expanded and improved.  Hunter Gatherers did not have “luxury beliefs” in their days.

                            The secretary of the Jamestown colony documented how the natives (of Powhatan tribe) slaughtered the game animals in the surrounding woods indiscriminately without regard for season or population, killing pregnant does and does with fawns as quickly as they’d kill a buck. He attested that the land would be much better managed by Englishmen, a course he supported after the tribe massacred a couple hundred colonists without warning one fine morning, coming into their homes under guise of friends, as they had been for years, and then suddenly turning on them with their own weapons and implements.Jerfferson’s turn of phrase “merciless Indian savages,” enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, wasn’t mere propaganda.

                    Practically from the beginning, Hollywood was guilty on behalf of the rest of us for the establishment of the USA at the Indians’ expense. And they tried to assuage the guilt by whitewashing–so to speak–the reality of Indian behavior and existence. Regardless, the Western genre is the most traditional in the history of US cinema and Josey Wales is one of the 20 best Westerns ever made.

                        No doubt, Hollywood was the chief brainwasher in the Fifties thru Seventies especially.
They prepared the populace for future legislation by anathematizing the Ebil Ebil White Male, while Romanticizing and deifying females, of-colors, and ‘indigenous peoples’.
WHAT indigenous peoples?  ANY indigenous peoples, as long as it wasn’t white males.
When the legal and cultural changes eventually followed, a sufficient percentage of the public already was prepared and enthusiastic to ‘do the right thing’.

        “Whether you believe it or not does not matter, but once you decide to act as if it is not real, then you enter the world in which it is perfectly acceptable to remove the people who cannot fit your model of society. In the end, every ideologue must reject free will in order to pull the trigger.”This makes me think of crazy covid times, and it was crazy no matter how it’s been smoothed over, and when having to justify your decisions to people as was required at the time evidently, it didn’t matter the science, the common sense, the just ‘I prefer not to, thanks for caring’ was never enough….but one time pushed to the brink when asked why not and what is it about you that these directives and mandates goes against/violates really? What the big deal? I said it goes against my Being. And that was the end of the struggle with anyone and with all. Nothing else to be said.So, the ideologues want and need to drive people to that point evidently. Probably so people like the person Zman mentions in this article, Sabine, to write papers about and discuss, the evil shits. We are ants, lab rats maybe, but not Human Beings to them.

If he had been five seconds earlier or later he would have been around for another sixty years.  And the driver of the car?  What good does any discussion of free-will do him or her?
“See this? This is this. This ain’t something else. This is this.”

                I agree. However, the strong materialist would argue that the brain is material and that what we call the “mind” is simply the manifestation of various chemical mixtures in the brain.

                    Neither strong materialism nor magic answer the ultimate question: why Life?
Because, the skein of Life is a function. The most necessary function in all the Universe, the key element without which everything would stop.  All the lights above us would go out.

                Exactly. Exactly. Materialism, as it is used, does not explain the ephemeral.
In other words, materialism is used merely as a cudgel to bludgeon people trying to describe what they have experienced. That is not science.  Semantic tomfoolery arises.
The saving grace is that white science does diagram the immaterial – electromagnetic physics, chemical reaction, harmonic frequency, atomic formation, etc. – therein lies the answers. Our peoples’ brains are uniquely attuned to such phenomena, thus we can see it.

In the future, how awful foreign appliances are, What its like living in the (for now) working parts of California, are wearables for us, and more.My goal is simply to entertain Chris’s community, nothing more, and have people discuss things and make connections. That is it.Why? Because I OWE Chris that. Especially and particularly after he died.I feel like crying now … but we have to maintain.

        Western thought popularly embraces free will at least in part because it’s necessary according to Christian (which means Roman Catholic) doctrine. Man is presumed to be able to choose between good and evil. Otherwise, what just God would reward or punish him for his choices?This would also explain why philosophies that would do away with Christianity and similar religions often seem to advocate the perspective that free will doesn’t exist, or is an illusion.

        “What we think of as physical reality is probably a simplified illusion of reality. Our brains evolved to conceptualize the parts of reality we need to understand in order for our genes to advance to the next round”I spent a lot of time listening to/reading Hassenfelder et al and Donald Hoffman (“The Case Against Reality”) during Covid. I ended up with a huge headache and came to the conclusions Zman does. Hoffman would also likely agree with Zman’s passage above. We’re not going to survive as a species unless people are accountable for their actions. This explains much of our current societal and governmental dysfunction.

        Z-man sorry I found the show pretty awful, as the guest was factually wrong on so many things I will list below. That I, just an ordinary dude who just remembers things can point  out the factual errors of the supposed domain expert makes him very suspect on everything.Pakistan helping Iran with nukes:Iran bombed Pakistan on Jan 16 2024 that killed two aimed at a Balochi Sunni group. Pakistan bombed Iran two days later killing nine and aimed at ANOTHER Balochi separatist group. Both sides are likely correct that the others sponsor terrorism.Iran Hostage Crisis:Khomeni supported the takeover and the hostages were transferred to his IRGC within a week. All of the hostages reported mock executions, with many being tortured, bound for days to chairs, in freezing rooms, Steve Lauterbach and Jerry Miele both attempted suicide. They were threatened with having their feet plunged into boiling oil or their eyes gouged out. One hostage, Miele, was repeatedly threatened with an electric chair execution as Khomeni’s guards built one and put him in it. Hostage David Roeder had guards threatening to kidnap his disabled son in America and send pieces of him to his wife. The torture and brutality were widely known, there were numerous books about this.Iran’s Civility:During Khomeni’s funeral, in 1989, the crowd tore off body parts. Saturday Night Live back when it was funny even mocked this “I got an arm.” Iran has repeatedly executed Bahais, in 1983 10 Bahai women were executed for not converting to Shia Islam. Shias repeatedly flagellate themselves during the festivals around Ali which is not a mark of civilized people. Zoroastrians are routinely repressed, executed, subject to discriminatory conscription (drafted and sent on suicide missions). Iran’s constitution IS very enlightened, but like the Soviet or US one means nothing. There is no evidence to suggest Iranians are cultured and civilized, quite the reverse. Tearing off body parts of a dead leader during his funeral. Need I say more.Death to America, Death to Israel:March 17, 1992, Iran conducted a Suicide bombing of the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires Argentina that killed 29, wounded 242. In July 19, 1994 Iran conducted another suicide bombing of the Jewish Cultural Center that killed 85 and wounded 300. On June 25, 1996, Iran bombed the Khobar Towers housing US Army personnel, killing 19 and wounding hundreds (this was in Saudi Arabia, the troops were there to safeguard against Iran’s enemy Saddam). On October 23, 1983, Iran bombed both US and French barracks killing 241 Marines and 58 French Army peacekeepers. On March 16, 1984 CIA Station Chief William Francis Buckley (no relation to the other one) was kidnapped, tortured, and murdered by Iran’s IRGC working with Hezbollah. Iran has sent hit teams to kill President Trump, his family, and members of his prior and current administration in retaliation for Trump’s authorizing the assassination of Gen. Soleimani. Soelimani was in Baghdad to organize the storming, killing, and capturing of US Embassy personnel. He was the architect and supervisor of the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing and frequently boasted about it in public.When the Regime’s anthem is “Death to America, Death to Israel” believe them.[The guest sounded as brainless as did RamzPaul as the ladies on the View, and CNN on this subject. Sorry RamZPaul, in that instance you were wrong.]Iran’s Council of Leaders:The council of Imams is stacked with Khameni supporters. It is not a non-ideological “council of experts” as such a thing never exists in human societies. It is instead a corrupt, interlocking (often intermarried) aristocracy that generates resentment due to corruption.Irans nuke program:Iran’s trucker strike was a good reference, but it points not to “lack of oil” but corruption in the government that sitting on a sea of oil it cannot provide subsidized gas and diesel domestically. Iran wants nukes for power projection, pure and simple. As proof of this the US government planning for fifteen years to take out Iran’s nuclear sites. That’s back into the Obama Administration.Not mentioned: Iran vs the Gulf States:Iran’s main enemy (and vice versa) are the Gulf States. It is official Iranian policy to overthrow the monarchies and replace it with Shia minority rule by Iran. This is why Israel, Saudi, Jordan, and most of the other Gulf states save Qatar (which plays footsie with Iran for protection) cooperate with one another against Iran. They don’t like each other, but have a dangerous mutual enemy.One does not have to sign onto Plan Bibi, or support for Israel, to be critical of Iran. It has been an enemy and intermittent danger (via the Straits of Hormuz) since 1979 and per above a long history of killing Americans through terror. The Regime hates the US and wants us dead (not the least of which it wants control over the Gulf not the US). The guest sounded like those Liberal White women who are disappointed with the many flaws and bad things about the US, and have issues with older family members and so idealize a foreign country and ignore all the massive flaws in that foreign country. Again, I am no domain expert but can cite the above instances where the guest was flat out factually wrong.Disclaimer: I do not really have an opinion if Trump was correct or not to bomb Iran as I don’t know enough to calculate that one way or another. Certainly after the Embassy takeover, Beirut Barracks, and Khobar Towers,  the US owes Iran no adherence to any norms or international standards and after the Embassy bombing in Buenos Aires and Iran training Hamas for Oct 7 neither does Israel. At least, as long as the current regime is there. Iran wanted those rule changes, they should be happy with them.I will say Iran’s leaders are stupid, ideological, and unlike Putin are unaware of their demographic limitations. Iran does stupid things that benefit them not, and only make more enemies or create even more opposition among those who might come to rapprochement. But given their identity and morality is based on Death to America, Death to Israel, what else can you expect?

            Whiskey, please accept my sincere apologies for mentioning this in public; I may not have another chance. Those here do not know.He will come to you and explain as much as he can. It is difficult to speak across the between. You will retain only highlights, but it will seem like an all-night long conversation. You will be quite lucid.It may take a few years, in mine it was 4. It takes time to reconstitute in such a radically different environment. A while after that, you will get a short sendoff as most experience it – a glimpse, a glance, but you will see light as he steps over the final line. Just as, when it happened, you saw lightning all around, then void, as you heard the silent shout.Again, my apologies. You will cheat as I did. What they sense, what they hope for, is what you will see for yourself.

        “We have free will and if we did not have it, we would have no choice but to invent as it is the only way we can live as human beings.”An age old question indeed.  My first introduction was as an undergraduate taking my required “Introduction to Psychology” course.   There we were introduced to B.F. Skinner whose fame rested upon being a rabid behavioralist.  Best known for his “Skinner Box” experiment/concept, he touched upon why we act as we do.  His revelation in short,“We are not free to choose; we are products of our environment and history of reinforcement.”A very enticing concept, except when you delved more deeply into explaining any particular human action beyond the simplest “stimulus-response” paradigm.  The complexity of describing all possible stimulus inputs producing the observed response was overwhelming.  From there it was a short trip into the pseudo scientific world of Freudianism.I left the course thinking that Skinner may very well have been correct, but his  explanation of the ultimate cause of human behavior was simply too complex to be useful.  As Z-man ponders in today’s missive, an incorrect, but simple/workable understanding might be more useful than a correct, but complex/theoretical understanding of human behavior.

        Have I called for total nerd death yet this week? Probably. It’s Thursday. That’s pretty late.The nerd’s nemesis is the cheerleader, a somewhat idealized one, not quite like the real ones we know. (Nerds don’t know any cheerleaders, or any other real things.) She’s out there, willing freely—or doing whatever, freely. Sheisfree—of neurosis, of all that nerds lie (theyalwayslie, because they don’t know anything) and call reason, calculation, analysis, morality, etc. Withoutany of that, she cheers—or whatever.She’s doing things. She’s enjoying a drink a friendly man gave her, and she doesn’t imagine it’s a rape potion, becauseno drink is.She’s singing “Baby It’s Cold Outside” with her friends because it’s Christmas time, and she doesn’t imagine it’s a rape anthem, becauseno song is(not even “Sleep Bandits.”) Etc. Her judgments, all “natural,” seemingly unsocialized—uncrippled by mental illness—are effortlessly correct.One such: She’s disgusted by nerds and avoids them.Everything the nerd believes—whatever attitude the nerd affects in “autistic” travesty of belief, to the disgust of all sane and decent people—is whatever seems, in the moment, todefile the cheerleader.“She didn’tdecideI’m unfuckable, you know. I mean if you really think about it, nobodydecidesanything. The swarm of precedential non-decision that carries us to anyseemingdecision is…”Etc. You understand the analogy. You’re not a nerd, or maybe you’re one of the good ones.

            In other words, the denial of free will springs from a frustrated, misanthropic disposition. (But does that disposition “cause” the denial of intentionality?) That’s certainly possible. Only yesterday I was thinking about how feminism almost certainly stems from plain or hideous physiognomies. (Hardly an original supposition on my part.) The correlation of personal ugliness and the individual feminist is too striking to be mere coincidence.

                            Modern governments and corporations are guaranteed employment for females.  Even the dullest are raised far above their merit.
And they do, quite literally, often get away with murder.  Not just of babies, but of adults as well.  After all, they’re only a girl! (when it advantages them)
Somebody needs to be liberated, but it damn sure ain’t females.

                    Feminism was established to silence and disempower the strong and free men who once inhabited America, men who would never sit still for being ruled tyrannically by women and their male enablers in government, corporations, etc. Organized feminism always was a top-down project.Righteous, angry men in groups are the only antidote to plutocratic gynarchy. That is why the FBI, NSA, CIA and other groups disallow modern men forming pro-masculine groups, and spy on us obsessively. This is why enemy Number One in the modern West is not the mullahs or Red China, but Andrew Tate.The boys and young men must be kept in the dark concerning the truth of their disenfranchisement and cultural bondage. Voila, Andrew Tate is a monster for telling boys the truth. I am not a personal fan of Mr. Tate, but I am a fan of the truth.Feminism also was established to cease population growth and place it in negative percentage decrease. Also to depress wages and massively spike competition.Those are the practical reasons. The spiritual reasons go much deeper and are even more sinister and nauseating. I will suffice in this space to say feminism is demonic and a death cult.

        Arguments that free will doesn’t exist are like arguments that bananas don’t exist. They start either by leaving the term “free will” undefined or by slipping in a philosophical definition that requires human action to be totally un-caused by prior events. Then they conclude,presto!, that free will doesn’t exist. You can use exactly the same argument to prove that bananas don’t exist.In fact, we all experience and exhibit behavior that we call “free will.” The only question is how best to define the reality that’s right in front of us. We can quibble about it, but the most defensible definition is some version of the libertarian: if coercion is not involved, then we act freely.

        “We have free will and if we did not have it, we would have no choice but to invent as it is the only way we can live as human beings.”It seems that the notion of “free will” has to shoulder more of the burden of our destiny than in medieval days. In the old days our occupation and station in life was predetermined and we couldn’t “reinvent” ourselves at will. If I was born a villein, I stayed a villein, and couldn’t become lord of the manor. Sure, there was a place for “free will”, otherwise the idea of heaven and hell makes no sense. Heaven is for those who turn towards God and hell for those who turn towards themselves and you have to assign them the “free will” to make that choice.The oriental idea of karma (or the idea of the stars and planets affecting one’s destiny) is plausible. But within this predetermined straitjacket of where I was born, to whom, my inherent dispositions, and the circumstances that occur to me, I have a limited latitude of choice and this affects my karma going forward.

            Interesting how such a concept of free will plays into our understanding of God and morality.  My go to book has been “Why Bad Things Happen to Good People” by Harold S. Kushner.
Limited free will is a good way of putting it.  Without such life would be an endless series of deterministic outcomes.  Without purpose or meaning, akin to a chemical reaction in a test tube.

                In stasis, in other words. Not dynamic or emergent, as all Life is.Sessile, not self-mobile, without possibility of adaption.
This is why the Darwinists argued against a static Creation – itself a form of predestination. Thus, they argued against the foredrawn conclusion of that destination as well, leaving us without guidelines.
In strict Darwinism, we might know where we’ve been, but we don’t know where we’re going.  Predicting that is the very purpose of thought.

                It is an old French word and used by the English in medieval times. It means simply, “farmhand” or “person of the village (villa)”. Basically referred to a lower class peasant who was one with no landholdings. Later on, the term became a perjoritive as it “began to be associated with crude, dishonest, or untrustworthy behavior. Eventually, in English, it evolved into its modern meaning of a morally corrupt or evil person.” (ChatGPT)I first ran across this distinction in Steven Pinker’s book, “The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined (2011).” In this book Pinker argues for a rapid decline in violence because of increased death rate (mainly due to execution/punishment) of violent individuals in merry old England.  Villains specifically mentioned.

                    Just as “gentleman” originally merely meant an established landowner. You can still read that meaning as late as Jane Austen: “He (Mr. Darcy) is a gentleman, and I am a gentleman’s daughter. So far we are equal.”  Eventually the term evolved into a compliment, with a meaning of refined manners and honorable behavior.

        If we don’t have free will, our decisions are predetermined by laws of nature. So we cannot have confidence about our belief about anything (for example, the truth of any argument), because this is not the result of a decision that corresponds to our assessment of reality but it is caused by deterministic laws of nature. This applies to the argument that argues that there is no free will.So we cannot know anything,not even the non-existence of free will. Let’s burn all the books and web pages. Nothing can be known. Why? Because there is no free will. How do you know that? You don’t because, without free will, you cannot know anything.Having said that, this Sabine Hossenfelder has a weird obsession with free will. Multiple videos trying to convince people that they don’t have free will. I have enjoyed several videos of her but I find her opinionated, ignorant in topics unrelated to physics and hard to bear, especially her b*tchy face.

        When it comes to “belief”, I realized I’m an atheist because I was born that way.Simple as.People’s mental model changes, but I can’t imagine someone in charge, try as I might. I’d be lying if I said otherwise. But then, lying is another something I can’t imagine.Sabine and Jeffrey Sachs both lost me as soon as they started raving about climate change. She seems to be trying in a roundabout way to say there’s someone in charge, who decides to give us free will or not, sets the rules, etc.Briggs, now, simply sees someone in charge- likely born that way, or born inclined to it- and doesn’t try to argue himself out of it. Why should he?

        Dar Mr. Sir,REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE-STRICTLY CONFIDENTIALI am Dr. Bakare Tunde, the cousin of Nigerian Astronaut, Air Force Major Abacha Tunde. He was the first African in space when he made a secret flight to the Salyut 6 space station in 1979. He was on a later Soviet spaceflight, Soyuz T-16Z to the secret Soviet military space station Salyut 8T in 1989.He was stranded there in 1990 when the Soviet Union was dissolved. His other Soviet crew members returned to earth on the Soyuz T-16Z, but his place was taken up by return cargo. There have been occasional Progrez supply flights to keep him going since that time. He is in good humor, but wants to come home.In the 14-years since he has been on the station, he has accumulated flight pay and interest amounting to almost $ 15,000,000 American Dollars. This is held in a trust at the Lagos National Savings and Trust Association. If we can obtain access to this money, we can place a down payment with the Russian Space Authorities for a Soyuz return flight to bring him back to Earth. I am told this will cost $ 3,000,000 American Dollars. In order to access his trust fund we need your assistance.Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account or subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening and/ or operating foreign accounts in our names.Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed to offer you 20 percent of the transferred sum, while 10 percent shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal andexternal) between the parties in the course of the transaction. You will be mandated to remit the balance 70 percent to other accounts in due course.Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include downpayment in this financial quarter.Please acknowledge the receipt of this message via my direct number 234 (0) 9-234-2220 only.Yours Sincerely,Dr. Bakare Tunde Astronautics Project Manager

        Dear Mr. Sir,REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE-STRICTLY CONFIDENTIALI am Dr. Bakare Tunde, the cousin of Nigerian Astronaut, Air Force Major Abacha Tunde. He was the first African in space when he made a secret flight to the Salyut 6 space station in 1979. He was on a later Soviet spaceflight, Soyuz T-16Z to the secret Soviet military space station Salyut 8T in 1989.He was stranded there in 1990 when the Soviet Union was dissolved. His other Soviet crew members returned to earth on the Soyuz T-16Z, but his place was taken up by return cargo. There have been occasional Progrez supply flights to keep him going since that time. He is in good humor, but wants to come home.In the 14-years since he has been on the station, he has accumulated flight pay and interest amounting to almost $ 15,000,000 American Dollars. This is held in a trust at the Lagos National Savings and Trust Association. If we can obtain access to this money, we can place a down payment with the Russian Space Authorities for a Soyuz return flight to bring him back to Earth. I am told this will cost $ 3,000,000 American Dollars. In order to access his trust fund we need your assistance.Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account or subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening and/ or operating foreign accounts in our names.Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed to offer you 20 percent of the transferred sum, while 10 percent shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal andexternal) between the parties in the course of the transaction. You will be mandated to remit the balance 70 percent to other accounts in due course.Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include downpayment in this financial quarter.Please acknowledge the receipt of this message via my direct number 234 (0) 9-234-2220 only.Yours Sincerely,Dr. Bakare Tunde Astronautics Project Manager

        Every instance of our experience— every sensation, every perception, every feeling, every thought, and every decision— is accompanied by electrical activity in specific neural circuits in our brains.Since we’re often not aware of the cascade of neural inpulses that precede our decisions, the case can be made that— despite the feeling that ‘I am freely choosing’— our brains are actually making these decisions for us, entirely apart from our conscious choices.

            “…our brains are actually making these decisions for us,…”
Then a branch of Philosophy—if not already—will spring up to discuss/contemplate what is it that makes us human and capable of “free will”, i.e., our brain, or something else? Something reminds me of a story about Diogenes of Sinope and Plato…
It never ends.

                Already exists–philosophy of mind. (Metaphysics and ontology also touch upon these topics.) Incidentally, many people believe psychology is simply philosophy of mind by another name. And they’re probably right.

        Dear Mr. Sir,REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE-STRICTLY CONFIDENTIALI am Dr. Bakare Tunde, the cousin of Nigerian Astronaut, Air Force Major Abacha Tunde. He was the first African in space when he made a secret flight to the Salyut 6 space station in 1979. He was on a later Soviet spaceflight, Soyuz T-16Z to the secret Soviet military space station Salyut 8T in 1989.He was stranded there in 1990 when the Soviet Union was dissolved. His other Soviet crew members returned to earth on the Soyuz T-16Z, but his place was taken up by return cargo. There have been occasional Progrez supply flights to keep him going since that time. He is in good humor, but wants to come home.In the 14-years since he has been on the station, he has accumulated flight pay and interest amounting to almost $ 15,000,000 American Dollars. This is held in a trust at the Lagos National Savings and Trust Association. If we can obtain access to this money, we can place a down payment with the Russian Space Authorities for a Soyuz return flight to bring him back to Earth. I am told this will cost $ 3,000,000 American Dollars. In order to access his trust fund we need your assistance.Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account or subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Serrvice Laws) from opening and/ or operating foreign accounts in our names.Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed to offer you 20 percent of the transferred sum, while 10 percent shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal andexternal) between the parties in the course of the transaction. You will be mandated to remit the balance 70 percent to other accounts in due course.Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include downpayment in this financial quarter.Please acknowledge the receipt of this message via my direct number 234 (0) 9-234-2220 only.Yours Sincerely,Dr. Bakare Tunde Astronautics Project Manager

        Whole thing sounds really fishy and weird to me since I read Ramzpaul’s message on X. I think he just had to go off grid for safety reasons because something happened yesterday and he told  his close ones to spread fake death rumours.

        Dear Mr. Sir,REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE-STRICTLY CONFIDENTIALI am Dr. Bakare Tunde, the cousin of Nigerian Astronaut, Air Force Major Abacha Tunde. He was the first African in space when he made a secret flight to the Salyut 6 space station in 1979. He was on a later Soviet spaceflight, Soyuz T-16Z to the secret Soviet military space station Salyut 8T in 1989.He was stranded there in 1990 when the Soviet Union was dissolved. His other Soviet crew members returned to earth on the Soyuz T-16Z, but his place was taken up by return cargo. There have been occasional Progrez supply flights to keep him going since that time. He is in good humor, but wants to come home.In the 14-years since he has been on the station, he has accumulated flight pay and interest amounting to almost $ 15,000,000 American Dollars. This is held in a trust at the Lagos National Savings and Trust Association. If we can obtain access to this money, we can place a down payment with the Russian Space Authorities for a Soyuz return flight to bring him back to Earth. I am told this will cost $ 3,000,000 American Dollars. In order to access his trust fund we need your assistance.Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account or subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Serrvice Laws) from opening and/ or operating foreign accounts in our names.Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed to offer you 20 percent of the transferred sum, while 10 percent shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal andexternal) between the parties in the course of the transaction. You will be mandated to remit the balance 70 percent to other accounts in due course.Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include downpayment in this financial quarter.Please acknowledge the receipt of this message via my direct number 234 (0) 9-234-2220 only.Yours Sincerely,Dr. Bakare Tunde Astronautics Project Manager

        Don’t Fall for Sex Enhancement Spam ScamsByABC Newshttps://s.abcnews.com/assets/dtci/random/svg/gma_logo.svgDecember 9, 2003, 4:34 AMN E W &amp;nbsp; Y O R K, Dec. 10 — If a company can afford to aggressively market products, it’s probably making a few bucks — but that doesn’t mean the products live up to the promises behind them.Dr. Jennifer Berman, a urologist and co-director of the Female Sexual Medicine Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, says men shouldn’t pin too much hope on the sexual enhancement products offered to them on a daily basis via e-mail.Berman says it’s virtually impossible to tell if they really work since most of the products are not regulated by the federal Food and Drug Administration, and therefore they have not been through government-monitored trials.In addition, some could be dangerous, she said.“If you’re undergoing surgery … some of them can be associated with bleeding, you need to be aware of that,” Berman said on ABCNEWS’ Good Morning America. “Don’t take a chance on them. If you’re curious about one of these products, talk to your doctor.”Berman says the success of the anti-impotence drug Viagra has helped legitimize the topic of sexual enhancement and that’s opened the floodgates for companies looking to cash in.Since the sexual enhancement industry is largely unregulated, it is tough to know how big the market actually is. But experts predict the marketing of its products won’t decrease any time soon.“Some of these companies will get 6,000 orders in a month for bottles of pills they’re charging $50 a bottle for,” Berman said. “It’s a huge market for them because they’re playing on men’s insecurities and their greatest wish and the thing they don’t want to talk to their doctors about. Just like women want to buy a magic wrinkle cream, men want a magic enhancement cream.”Promises of Enhancement and ArousalSome of the elements being marketed via e-mail have curious names, like Horny Goat Weed and Yohimbe. While Horny Goat Weed is marketed as a botanical sexual enhancer that’s used in China and Japan, Yohimbe, a South African herb, has been referred to as an aphrodisiac.

        Dear Mr. Sir,REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE-STRICTLY CONFIDENTIALI am Dr. Bakare Tunde, the cousin of Nigerian Astronaut, Air Force Major Abacha Tunde. He was the first African in space when he made a secret flight to the Salyut 6 space station in 1979. He was on a later Soviet spaceflight, Soyuz T-16Z to the secret Soviet military space station Salyut 8T in 1989.He was stranded there in 1990 when the Soviet Union was dissolved. His other Soviet crew members returned to earth on the Soyuz T-16Z, but his place was taken up by return cargo. There have been occasional Progrez supply flights to keep him going since that time. He is in good humor, but wants to come home.In the 14-years since he has been on the station, he has accumulated flight pay and interest amounting to almost $ 15,000,000 American Dollars. This is held in a trust at the Lagos National Savings and Trust Association. If we can obtain access to this money, we can place a down payment with the Russian Space Authorities for a Soyuz return flight to bring him back to Earth. I am told this will cost $ 3,000,000 American Dollars. In order to access his trust fund we need your assistance.Consequently,  my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account or subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Serrvice Laws) from opening and/ or operating foreign accounts in our names.Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed to offer you 20 percent of the transferred sum, while 10 percent shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal andexternal) between the parties in the course of the transaction. You will be mandated to remit the balance 70 percent to other accounts in due course.Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include downpayment in this financial quarter.Please acknowledge the receipt of this message via my direct number 234 (0) 9-234-2220 only.Yours Sincerely,Dr. Bakare Tunde Astronautics Project Manager

        Every statue in Europe gets caked in pigeon guano eventually.  So too, does every successful blogger.Z was no different.  The pigeons settled on his ample arms and his crooked cap early, and began to comment, and to peck and to strut and to sh*t, as is their wont.After two years, the Zman had attracted his flock.  And he soon he was coated in concreted chalky commentary:   another bronze Trafalgur.At some point the constant uric discharges from the constant flocks accrete such that a man of Z’s character and wit must, perforce, leap away to dodge the relentless pigeons.Z isn’t dead.  He’s in a hotel lobby in Santiago, Chile, smoking a cigar right now, instead. Only your constant perch in the public square, his blog, has fallen.And it is this that you really mourn, pigeon.
