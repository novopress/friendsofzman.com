        [‚Ä¶] You don‚Äôt throw way something because it makes you angry. You discard that which you see has no value.¬†That‚Äôs where the managerial class finds itself today. The people over whom they rule increasingly see no reason for that class to exist. Supporting a guy like Trump is not an act of anger. It is an act of disrespect. The Trump vote is the peasant who refuses to bow to his king. It‚Äôs the slave refusing an order from the master. The act is symbolic, not practical.¬† Keep Reading‚Ä¶. [‚Ä¶]

        I said it the moment Trump showed up on the radar, Trump is the great fuckyou. He is my great fuckyou.
Instead of anger, think cold anger. The Russian‚Äôs have that cold anger thing down pat.Great piece by the way.Thanks for sticking up for us.

        Trump appears to be your version of our Farage. All sorts of flaws ‚Äî real and imagined ‚Äî not acceptable in lots of ways and easy to laugh at if you think floppy hair or baggy eyes are laughable, but willing to talk about the important, life-changing things the dull, same-old-same-olds will not say.They may not have a solution but at least they are airing the issues, not blandly sweeping them under the carpet.Also, you know that people who like them in some way are on to something when the usually supine, establishment-kissing media rallies its pen-pushing and mealy-mouthed might against them. Maybe, just maybe, they are the first real cut in the stale cake we get continually offered.

            That‚Äôs about right, I think. The differences in our system, however, allow Trump to be a serious candidate, while Farage remains on the fringe. In Britain, UKIP can be an anchor for the Tories and maybe, in time, drag them back to the center. In the US, parties have to go through a collapse and regeneration. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening to the GOP. The globalist wing is being sloughed off like a snake skin so a new improved snake can emerge.

        I‚Äôve had it up to here with denigrating folks that didn‚Äôt finish college with a degree or that didn‚Äôt go‚Ä¶ as inferior.  I went three years before I left, having running out of money and in debt, went to the Army.  Best thing I ever did and led to a 30 year career after I got out of the Army.  Just because I never graduated it‚Äôs assumed I‚Äôm not book smart.  I have a library of books.  I read more than my peers.  Most of my friends with degrees quit reading anything as soon as it wasn‚Äôt required for them to get their degree.I‚Äôm SICK of it.  Too many generalizations.  I support Trump and I am angry.  I know full well what the dangers are of a populist non-politician presents and I‚Äôm all on board with taking the risk‚Ä¶ because I disrespect the betters.  I‚Äôm sick and tired of being told how what prism I‚Äôm supposed to view events through‚Ä¶ even though I might have a much clearer vision‚Ä¶ a more realistic vision.Time to blow the whole thing up.  I‚Äôm tired.  I‚Äôm tired of the lies and I‚Äôm tired of being segregated as a second class citizen worthy of scorn because I didn‚Äôt get a stupid degree from my University.  All of my classmates were so focused on setting themselves apart‚Ä¶  getting a degree meant they wouldn‚Äôt be a piece of crap dirt clod eater.  Rubbish.  I read more and can write better than many of my peers who stuck it out and got their degrees, but I will forever been seen as trashy to them and theirs.Class warfare.  It‚Äôs whats for dinner.  And it‚Äôs beneath this country.  Shame on all that buy into it‚Ä¶ and to the notion that a college education somehow grants a degree holder with a super smart badge to forever hold themselves above and beyond that of the common man who refused to play along.  A degree means something and for many careers it is required.  But too many use it as a bludgeon to pound their fellow citizens as mouth-breathing simpletons and that‚Äôs crap.

            I hear you RobM. I had a friend who went on to become a public school teacher after graduating from college who told me that he had never read a book all the way through in his life.

            No disagreement here, buddy. üôÇ I only went to college because all the authority figures in my life from the time I was a toddler told me I had to go or I‚Äôd be poor and worthless.
They couldn‚Äôt have been more wrong. Most of the people I know without college degrees make a lot more than I do, and their lives and jobs are much more interesting than mine.
If I had it to do over again, knowing what I know now, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have gone to college.

                I went to college because that was what anyone with brains was supposed to do back then.  I wish I had been a plumber or an electrician.  I would be retired and living like a king in Patagonia.

        Trump agrees and amplifies (that‚Äôs agametechnique):‚ÄúYou‚Äôre damn right I‚Äôm angry. I‚Äôm angry about how this country is being run. And so are the American people. Anger is good. Anger is what this country needs.‚ÄùBut how dares a commoner like Trump even run, sacr√© bleu!And to quotethisvery Z Blog like comment:‚ÄúYes PC is just the latest incarnation of Puritanism: the same iconoclastic urge to tear down the ‚Äòsuperstitions‚Äô of the past and build a new moral order, the same self-righteous conviction of certainty ‚Äì allied with rigid intolerance of dissent, the same ostentatious/competitive self-abnegation ‚Äì even to the point of self-harm.This mentality is quintessentially American, and politically manifests itself again and again in U.S. history, though in different guises.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs really it in a nutshell.

        It‚Äôs like you said before Zman, the Media is there to be the mouthpiece of the ruling political class, not to inform or be contrarian.
The best thing about the Trump phenomenon is that exposed the Neocon establishment that took over the GOP, the Conservative prestige media is based in NYC and DC like the Liberal prestige media and there isn‚Äôt much difference between each other. They‚Äôre all run by the Tribe, for the Tribe interests.

        I am still, as Ace of Spades likes to put it, ‚ÄúTrump-curious.‚Äù I‚Äôm not a full-on Trump guy ‚Äî I‚Äôm not full-on for anybody yet ‚Äî but he continues to impress me.I got into an argument with my Dad this weekend about Trump. My Dad‚Äôs an interesting case. He grew up very poor but is now very rich. Politically, he‚Äôs the most establishment GOP guy you can imagine. He thinks Jeb Bush and John Kasich are the perfect candidates. Obviously, he hates Trump.I tried to draw out exactly why he thinks this way ‚Äî why a guy who grew up the way he did would be so out of touch. I can see it from a guy who grew up with a silver spoon in his mouth. But my dad grew up in a family that couldn‚Äôt afford shoes. (No joke ‚Äî I‚Äôve seen the house he grew up in. Calling his upbringing ‚Äúworking class‚Äù would be generous.)As best I am able to discern, his worldview was basically shaped and formed by late-20th-century mainstream corporate America. As I said, he‚Äôs very well-off, but he got that way not by being an entrepreneur, but by being a loyal company man, and it seems to me he still thinks that‚Äôs the way the world works today, even though he‚Äôs been retired for about a decade. Jeb and Bush appeal to him because they‚Äôre loyal company men, and (in his mind) loyal company men are supposed to get rewarded. That‚Äôs the way the system is supposed to work.When I kept bringing up immigration, he just took it as obvious that no American would ever want to do the jobs that illegal Mexicans do.‚ÄúYou never had to work in the fields, or work in a chicken plant, like I did. You don‚Äôt know how hard it is,‚Äù he kept saying. It was just self-evidently preposterous to him that any American could be expected to do these jobs.He didn‚Äôt put it this way, but it was clear from the way he talked about it that ‚Äúimmigrants‚Äù to him are something less than human, essentially a slave labor class doing jobs that self-respecting Americans can‚Äôt be expected to do. He didn‚Äôt say this, but I got the impression he thought a primary purpose of bringing in lots of immigrants was to ensure that his OWN sons would never have to work in a chicken plant like he did.That might make sense if there were oodles of well-paying, clean, dignified white collar or blue collar jobs available these days, but there aren‚Äôt. If I, God forbid, ever have to take a job in a chicken plant, I don‚Äôt want to be made to feel like an alien interloper in my own country, like I was when I briefly did landscaping work for a summer job in L.A. It was the only job I‚Äôve ever walked off of, because my supervisor (a white guy, of course) continually insulted me and made it clear that he didn‚Äôt want anything other than dull, compliant Mexicans working on his crew.At the time, I was lucky enough to have the option to quit. I was a college-educated white guy in graduate school, and it was the middle of the housing boom, so I had other opportunities. But I wonder what it would be like if I was a high school dropout who *didn‚Äôt* have other opportunities. Hell, maybe I would have decided to go on welfare and smoke meth, too.Also, it never seemed to occur to my dad that this slave labor class might eventually decide that THEY‚ÄôRE too good for field work, too, creating a whole host of other problems.I frankly don‚Äôt see how America‚Äôs going to make it another 50 years in the form in which it exists today. The divisions are just too stark, the chasms to wide to bridge. Something‚Äôs gotta give. I‚Äôm curious about Trump not because I think he‚Äôs all that great, but he might be the force which finally breaks the logjam and allows the country to resort itself into some more politically viable arrangement.

            I‚Äôve worked at an egg ranch. I tried to get on at a chicken place in CA but couldn‚Äôt get hired. And I‚Äôve picked apples and sorted fruit. Frankly I like physical labor more than desk jobs. You have more time to think and there‚Äôs a rhythm to it. I couldn‚Äôt get a fruit job now even if I could still do the work. They discriminate against white workersI think societies go down hill quickly when they decide they won‚Äôt do ‚Äúdirty‚Äù jobs. At that point, you‚Äôve decided the work is beneath you and you need to bring people you consider to be inferior to do those jobs. And more and more jobs become beneath you and soon there‚Äôs no work left that you are willing to do.

                Yeah, I‚Äôve never had a problem with physical labor, either. It can actually be quite peaceful. I‚Äôd done landscaping work before, which is why I thought I‚Äôd be perfect for that landscaping job out in California. I walked away because the abuse from the supervisor was just too much.I wouldn‚Äôt say they *openly* discriminated against white applicants at that place, but they certainly did everything they could to make whites feel unwelcome. (I‚Äôve heard that this is not unusual for many illegal-immigrant-dominated industries.) I mean, if I‚Äôd been a black guy and had a supervisor talk to me that way, I could have sued and won a million dollars, easy. Judging from my supervisor‚Äôs attitude, they would have discriminated openly if they thought they could get away with it.

                I‚Äôve always found physical work more mentally satisfying, generally speaking. It‚Äôs not that other types of work are unsatisfying. It‚Äôs just that they often lack a defined end point so you always feel like there‚Äôs stuff left undone. I think if I were starting all over, I‚Äôd be a welder. I always like metal work and I had a talent for welding. It pays well enough and it is satisfying work.

                    the lack of an end-point is really the cause of frustration in many ‚Äúwhite collar‚Äù jobs. I spent 28 years in doing what can be called ‚Äúrocket science‚Äù for a 4 letter agency and the number of times I reached an end point that was acknowledged with tangible effects was less than a dozen‚Ä¶On the other hand in my experiences with physical labor end was accomplished almost everyday.

                Many in the U.S. would process chicken for $20 an hour and benefits.  There are no jobs Americans are not willing to do, but as long as illegals flood the labor market and keep it at $7.50 an hour there won‚Äôt be many takers.

                    When enough illegals are at your command you can have psychopaths supervise them and treat them like garbage. The trash gets thrown out and more floods in to be ripped apart. The garbage barely notices because they don‚Äôt expect better coming where they are from. Americans (blacks too) expect better and that‚Äôs reason enough not to want to get mixed up in businesses with illegals ‚Äì even when the money might be a necessity.

            Great comment. The reality is that even an American teen is more productive and therefore can demand a higher salary than an illegal immigrant. I‚Äôve always held out In-N-Out Burger as the proof. It pays suburban teens market wage, well above minimum, get many times the productivity of minimum wage illegals at their competitors and charge about the same for a burger and fries.Every job has a wage point where citizens will do it. That‚Äôs not the issue. The issue is that the managerial class wants 5500 sq ft homes and BMWs instead of the 2500 sq ft houses and Buicks their dads had.  To do that, they need to keep costs way down so they can afford their largess.  Not too different than Orwell‚Äôs O‚ÄôBrien swilling wine served by a butler while the outer party and proles starve.

        Excellent piece!I am a Trump supporter, and I am somewhat angry. But the thing that makes me angry is not just Obama as Mr. Hansen suggests. I expect Obama to act like Obama.Republicans who are cowed by the Democrats are the real source of my anger. A perfect example is the Republican establishment pick, Mitt Romney, during the last election. When confronted by a lying Obama, backed up by a lying Candy Crowley, while debating the Benghazi debacle, Romney folded like a cheap suit. You could literally see his spine turns to jelly and his balls shrivel. I have always felt he sealed his defeat at that point in time.I can‚Äôt imagine that happening to the Donald. He may have his shortcomings, but a lack of grit is not one of them.

            The Z Man once before wrote that when the Left loses they cry and point the finger of blame outside whereas when the Right loses they demand accountability from themselves. This perfectly echoes yours and my anger.How can we look at the TV or newspapers when we know we are being fed lies? We try to convince ourselves that it isn‚Äôt really what we think but we know it is. Why isn‚Äôt someone looking out for our interests? So along comes the Don.I honestly don‚Äôt care if he burns the place down because it will get rebuilt again. If Hillary wins though, the United States can kiss its ass goodbye and nobody will clean up the mess.
