        Al Sharpton, are you kidding.  This man is a dangerous sub-moron.  He should be in jail for inciting to riot.

        The fact that the President of the United States and Leader of the Free World felt the need to appear on Al Sharpton’s radio show recently tells you everything you need to know about the state of the Republic in general and of the Democrat Party in particular.

        This is the Faustian bargain blacks have made with Democrats: we will vote for you come hell or high water as long as we get our Free Government Swag and get to “protest” the Man instead of looking for a job. The racial grievance industry is alive and well, even when the narrative doesn’t hold up under scrutiny. Respectable blacks are working and at this point probably wishing this whole Ferguson thing would just go away. Unfortunately, it appears that Sharpton and his merry band of Race Hustlers don’t care about respectable, non-feral blacks. There’s no paycheck in it.
