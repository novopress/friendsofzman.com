        As for the issue of drugs, weed is legal in my state now and all it appears to have done is make a few sleazy people rich and hugely increased the rate of accidents and crazyGranted this is California so crazy is the terrain but still, it hasn’t helpedIts obviously not possible now I’m starting to come to the conclusion we need a vaccine for most of these drugs to be administered at age 12 or so and kept updated free of charge.This probably won’t help with pain killer addiction as people might need that option legally but the rest of got to go as they are making it increasingly harder to have a functionality society

        Good mayo on good fries is delicious, better than ketchup.

        For a good overview of how Jante Law has driven feminism, and lack of exceptionalism, read Roosh’s “Don’t Bang Denmark”.“Bring on the Law of Jante…” smh.

        “It is the ideal that American Progressives imagine for their enclaves, even though they never put it that way. A city full of smart, middle-class white people, with just the smallest dash of diversity, is a great place to live. It’s certainly why Copenhagen is always high on the list of the happiest places on earth, along with other white cities.”

            Techno Viking is awesome,thanks Frip.
I scoffed at mayo with fries till I tried it. Mixed with a bit of dill pickle relish,it’s addictive.

                I always order a side cup of Ranch and squeeze a good bit of yellow mustard in it.  Mix it up and dip fries.   I never liked ketchup because I’m sophisticated as hell.

                I often order mayo with fries. Its tastier than ketchup. I’ve tried it with dill pickle relish, we call that tartar sauce around here and serve it with fish BTW. I’m not as fond of it.

        Great travelogue, Z-man. When I visited Copenhagen in 1985 it was the punk capital of the world, seemingly. Nothing but lacquered, dyed mohawks in the public squares. This was after that fashion trend had already peaked in the UK and the States.
Mayo on the fries – yep. Real good version to be had in Amsterdam too.

        Z: ” I looked everywhere but I was unable to find caps, shorts of jerseys for the local teams. It was all American sports teams and American sports apparel brands. That and hip-hop music. Every store, hip-hop music.”Foreigners like to gripe that Americans think the rest of the world is thinking about them.   I used to buy that line and feel kinda guilty.  Then I saw the rest of the world, and watched their TV shows (ours) and watched their news (about us), and realized the rest of the world really does think about us a lot.  I was truly amazed at just how much.

            We Americans are like that mysterious crazy second cousin that occasionally rolls into town and turns everything topsy-turvy.  Then we leave and everyone gets back to normal, but tries to figure out what just happened.  That’s why they love us, hate us, and are fascinated by us, all at once.  They are also often glad to see us go, to be honest.
Trump is the galactic hyper-version of that same thing.

                Funny.  Yeah, politics aside, it would’ve really sucked if America was represented by Hillary Clinton.  Just debilitatingly uncool.  Like, taking your sister to the prom uncool.  The land of Robert E. Lee, Teddy Roosevelt, Henry Ford, and Steve McQueen, now presents you with…fat ass in a pantsuit.

        Good point on the weed culture.  My minimal college experience with the weed was that one gets fascinated with the most trivial and mundane things, and the pointless becomes awesome.  I was reminded of the days when I was moving wifey’s car out of the garage, and some moronic woman on NPR was going on about how death is a reversion to the soil, and back to nature’s rhythms, and recycling your body, and how thrilling it is to know this, and blah, blah, blah.  All I could think of was “stoner chick”.  Turns out it was a TED Talk and she was some sort of tenured academic who was self-styled as an expert on death.  I so look forward to our stoner nation future—not.

        Your observations about the presence and influence of hip hop music is more pertinent than perhaps you realize. In the most fundamental sense, this archetype exists because it works. By that I mean that it is a highly effective methodology for subliminal mental infection. Syncopation, inflection, and repetition are highly tuned to resonate within the mind’s neuronal rhythms and thereby create mental habits at the most basic level. The tedium of urban living creates systemic boredom because of the extinction of existential threat. Hip hop fills this void by simulating the sounds of the jungle.

            I read somewhere relatively recently that China banned hiphop in conjunction with a mass deportation of 50,000 illegal invader Africans. Someone is paying attention to the mechanisms of the destruction of the West, and how to prevent it from happening to them.

        We spent a few days in Copenhagen on the way to Spain…it is indeed remarkably quiet, and very white. We were there in the winter, when the sea mist permeates every piece of clothing you have, so very cold..I have to admit that, apart from visiting the famous Mermaid, there was not a lot to do in central Copenhagen. It rather reminded me of Munich, but with less activity.

        As for the Freetown, only hicks are scandalized by it. The greatest scandal is that the inhabitants live almost rent free on one of the most desirable locations in Copenhagen. For insiders, the scandal is that this ostensible hippie commune are ruled by greedy dictators.Personally, I’d like to take a bulldozer to the place, restore the bastions and the moat, make it into a park, maybe keep a few of the restaurants. As you noted, the area is astonishingly beautiful, especially for a location that close to the city center.The problem is that the Copenhagen bourgeoisie like to have a place where they can get their drugs without having to deal with street pushers. Legalize pot, get some cozy coffee shops and Christiania will be history inside five years.

        The vibrancy of Nørrebro depends very much on the time of day. From 7-9AM, it’s almost strictly Danes on their way to work, and as the main street, Nørrebrogade, is one of the major arteries for bicycle commuters, there’s a lot of whiteys. The locals only start to come out about noon.

        How right you are about malls! I was in Cologne 3 months before the infamous New Year’s Eve sexual assaults. Staying in a businessy, not too bad neighborhood. Went to the local mall in the late afternoon. Like in every country, teenagers were hanging out in front of the mall. The mall is just the center of teenage and young adult community life. Perhaps that is white: if a neighborhood “goes”, it is the teenagers and young adults who “go” first.I could see two kinds of young people: white girls and brown boys. Perhaps the brown girls were just not allowed out by their parents, as they are not allowed to talk to any male non-family-members anyway, but where were the white boys? Did the brown boys promise them a beating if they show up or they just chose videogames over trying to outcompete the brown boys at flirting with the girls?At any are they are growing up with the firm knowledge that they are sexually, and socially, and generally just as a man, in their manliness, inferior to brown boys.

            Trip over which pond? Denmark can be reached overland from Belgium, the home of French fries. Adding mayos sounds a little like Quebec’s version of French fries: poutine.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poutine

                Yes, enjoyed the Belgian mayo on fries on a trip in the 1980’s.  Lovely place, pre invasion.To each his own, as almost every language has this expression.The only true outrage is vegetarianism.  Disgusting!

            I think it started in the nineties with the mayo on fries. Prior to that it was remoulade or ketchup. Ketchup is still used by many. cold/hot sauce bearnaise is also used by some.

        Your link to the Islamic Center of America is interesting. I have driven down the main road near it many times and viewed it from afar with disinterest. Still not interested enough to get closer. Most of Dearborn has been surrendered and go off the beaten path and you can’t even read the signs.

        Boy, that’s the truth about malls. Having lived in and around Atlanta most of my life, I’ve seen the death of many malls. In Atlanta, it’s not just diversity in the area, the devastation also follows rapid transit.
I looked at the “livable cities” link. I noticed that most brag about their diversity.

            In most lib towns diversity consists of a few well-behaved coloreds and foreigners accompanied by a plethora of restaurants with exotic foods. True vibrancy and cultural enrichment are unknown or quietly supressed.

            Same in the Chicago area, where I grew up. The only malls that have survived are on the Northern lake front, where the real estate prices keep the vibrants from living there. Every other mall in the Chicago area goes through a short lifespan until it becomes too vibrant to survive. And even the upper class malls I mentioned will slowly be undermined by the diversity coming up from the city, or from the poorer suburbs. Auto theft from the parking lots is already rising, which is one of the first signs.

        The progressive may want a city full of smart, middle-class white people, with a dash of diversity…
What they always seem to get (in the U.S. at least) is a nice city center full of rich people, with the truly poor a few blocks away.  The middle class is pushed out to the perimeter by crime and costs.

        If you want to see some diversity you need to cross the bridge into Malmo. I used to spend a lot of time there in the late ’90s and early ’00s. I don’t believe I would recognize the place anymore.

        I have lived in Nørrebro for 4.years. Most of the buildings are from 1880-1900 and was a area for the working class. Between 1960-1975 some of the worst buildings were taken down because they purely built and did´t have any toilet facilities. They were replaced by newly built social housing. So, you have  in Nørrebro islands of social housing projects from that periode that is inhabited with 3.rd world immigrants. The older buildings the 19-century are privately owned and inhabited by danes. Many young and progressives live there but many move when they start to have a family. Close to Nørrebro you have Østerbro that historically was for the middel class. There is no social housing built there and almost no immigrants. The same with the city center that is more expensive. Most 3.rd world immigrants in northern Europe live in social housing projects built in the sixties. Most of them are in the suburbs of the cities. In Sweden they came up with a plan for social housing in the fifties called “the million programme”. They wanted to built one million new apartments for the working class. The problem was that the raising working class did´nt want to live there but wanted their own private properties. It was the same in Denmark. Many of these social housing projects was empty in the seventies and it was planned to take some of them down. In the beginning of eighties 3.rd world immigration though asylum stated and there was a demand for these social housing projects. Because most of them are in these suburbs to the cities and often are cities on their own people could live almost segregated from the immigrants. This is changing because these suburbs are filled up and the problems from them starts to spill over to the rest of society. 3.rd world immigration was only a problem for the working class who had to live close to them for decades but now it starts to effect the middel class because it cannot be contained in these suburbs anymore. I think it is the case for most of northern Europe.

                There are several mosque on Nørrebro. Historically most of the have been in abandon production facilities. Within the last last decade two new mosque has been built from the grund. One sunni mosque with money from Qatar and it is known to have strong connections to the muslim brotherhood. The second one is a shia mosque paid by Iran. I don´t think many persians come there. I think it mostly used by Shias from Iraq. The Turkish state has recently subsided several mosques but I think it is in cites close to Copenhagen.

                Once a year the shia muslims have their Ashura parade that goes though Nørrebro and though the center of the city. I think the majority of them are from Iraq. I saw several times when I lived there and it was funny to see the face of many progressives when the saw it. Many looked quite scared. 3.min video of it here from Nørrebro;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUeKN2GPj5E

            I have mentioned before that I come from a very diverse family. I have first cousins that are of Scandinavian and other European descent as well as Blacks and Asians, and have spent time on every continent but Australia and Antarctica. Once in Europe we had occasion to visit one of the compounds outside a major city that I think was built for the purpose of housing immigrant labor. The place looked like a prison from the outside, was surrounded by chain link fence topped off by barbed wire, and we entered through a closable gate, although I never saw it closed. The apartments were of formed concrete that looked like a rush job. I saw no duct work or vents. All the windows in the place seemed to be open, and there were space heaters in the main rooms that looked like they had been purchased as used goods. Walls covered with family photos and old wardrobes because no closet space. This was close to twenty years ago, so there was a dark underbelly to Europe before all this refugee crap and unfettered movement brought about by the EU.We also visited downtown apartments occupied by immigrant labor. Better built, but very small.There are parts of Europe no tourist is supposed to see. And maybe not even Europeans. After the last several years, perhaps everything one sees there is a Potemkin village.

                Europe’s foreign labor problem dates back long before the EU. Large numbers began arriving in the 1950s economic boom, as a way to curb the power of the labor unions. Further increases happened in the 1970s as a way to appease Arab nations to ensure oil supply. Contraception and feminism were now reducing fertility.Arguably it extends even further back, to the days of the First World War when colonial troops were brought to France, and a large number of Chinese coolies were brought in to fill support roles.There’s a similar Ellis Island type myth that the “hard working immigrants rebuilt Europe” after the war. Welfare dependency data shows this to be a lie. Foreign labor is a child of the Marshall Plan.
