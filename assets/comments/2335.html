        Nations are defunct. Communities (homosexual, feminist, black, Jewish, Moslem, etc.) struggle for dominance across national boundaries, across the world.
Not all peoples transformed themselves into communities. Not yet. Until transformed, these peoples will plead helplessly for their nations to protect them.

        There are several factors. Jews, especially the ones you are describing, have no great affection for the country (I am increasingly sympathetic to that state of being). That being so they always have an exit strategy and a tradition of using it, so they continue to indulge their opinions–which are life itself to them–without restraint. And if the block is busted, well, they’ll once again be the first to sell. This strategy has worked well for them in recent times except for that miscalculation of 1933-45. But Montaigne wrote that even opinion is of force enough to make itself  be espoused at the expense of life. No one contributes more to opinion than Jews, with less regard for the consequences.

        Perhaps open immigration to the U.S. is desirable to Jewish people because it is the best insurance against the return of WASP influence in the nation.  Jews, as all of us, need to feel safe, and they perceive the real threat to their well-being as coming from Christian cultures, not Muslim.  Hence their strong support of the party of unlimited WASP (and Evangelical) dilution.  To their mind, glares can’t hurt them the way Mainline Protestants can, whether in Europe historically or America at present.

            It could be. I don’t think they sit around thinking about it that much so it could simply be a habit of people who have been a part of the liberal coalition for generations.

        The Europeans are spineless. You can kill someone premeditated and its only 10 years in a nice prison  for example.
