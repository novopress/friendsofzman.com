        And the elites don’t seem to worry about having an illegal take their job. If I were interviewed about this on tv, I would ask the reporter why he/she thinks they will still have a job when the country is overwhelming hispanic?
And I noticed an article elsewhere mention that Tom Steyer has been giving money to hispanic politicians in CA. The reason Trump is popular right now is that he is pointing out this process. Rich people buy politicians to do favors for them.

        One of the biggest reasons the conservative Elites are no longer against immigration is because they don’t have to live with the consequences, so if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em, seems to be the current mantra. Of course, they live in communities, gated or mega-wealthy, that are probably 99% white. “Maria” and “Jose” come to clean and do landscaping whilst the Elites are at work making their Big Benjamins. Oh, look at us Very Special People, providing jobs for poor immigrants who work hard! See? Isnt immigration great? The Elites don’t worry that the immigrants, legal or not, are pouring into the neighborhood public schools, overwhelming an already fragile and near useless enterprise, but funded by tax dollars these same immigrants do not pay, because of course their children are in private schools. Who pays for the health care of this population? The character of these communities is changing and not for the better. Crime goes up, families who can, leave. Everyone else gets stuck with people who do not share our culture, values, or language, and are unafraid to show their disdain for us. And now we have to deal with a seemingly endless supply of Mohammeds via the Refugee Resettlement program. This is not going to end well.

        Isn’t it interesting that only white people can be accused of racism and must purge themselves by welcoming in their conquistadors?  In a post on another website, the question was asked “Are white men gods?”   It was then followed by a list of maybe 100 things that white men had discovered or invented which was basically everything in use today.  Gave me pause.  All races have had access to raw materials but it has been the white men who have advanced science, technology, industry, the arts and literature.  I know other races contributed but not proportionally  to the extent the whites have.  I think whites should be proud of their heritage and not apologize for bringing mankind into the new age with such bounty.  And yes, mistakes were made.

        Trump has certainly tapped into the “silent majority.” A truly frightening prospect for inbred, calcified, comfortable politicians.My education concerning “how the world works” occurred in the mid 50’s when I was 5 or 6. An early small time band of Pro Wrestlers were performing in an armory. I noted the vicious antagonism displayed in the ring and the loud approval of the crowd. A short attention span left me to wander down a few hallways. The dressing room door was open. It amazed me how all the combatants enjoyed each others company.
