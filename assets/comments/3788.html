        Sorry, Duck: I am not sure Hitchens (Christopher, i presume, not Peter) was ‘mediocre’ at all. If you search the internet for the youtube video of him explaining how islam was created and altered and generally pissed about with for the advantage of certain groups then I think you might not think he was quite so average. He could, and did, hold his own in arguments and wasn’t scared to face people.Also… I have a view of Putin that hinges more on him doing what he thinks best for his country and not for the pleasure of ‘the west.’ That may irritate the EUSSR and the USASSR but in that light you can see why he does what he does.

            Americans have been anti-Russian for a very long time. There’s no easy or obvious answer. Some say it is the Jew thing, but I don’t quite buy it. American communist movements were stocked with Eastern Ashkenazi Jews in the first half of the 20th century. German Jews were not exactly a bunch of libertarians so it is hard to fathom that split being the genesis of a general anti-Russian attitude in America. I suspect the driver here is unfamiliarity. Not a lot of Russian immigrated to the US in the great European wave of immigrants. Germans, Poles, French, Italians, etc fought as Americans in the great wars. Russians were on the other side.I don’t think it is possible to under estimate how the Cold War warped American elites. The Social Gospel Movement flowed into anti-Communism as well as anti-Imperialism, anti-Colonialism and a whole bunch of domestic causes. You cannot be a respectable member of the ruling elite without having a cause. In foreign policy, that means always having an enemy. The fight with whom is defining. The Russians have been the perfect foil for close to 100 years now.

        I see you why you don’t think much of his qualifications, since he doesn’t have any, but I’m not sure why you call the article “swill”.
He recommends honesty as a general policy instead of deceit, I think that’s probably wise.
On the other hand, he does seem to be suggesting that we get all confrontational over Ukraine, and I don’t see that we have any critical national security interest there. Is that the problem?

            I have no issue with him working as a reporter. I’d put him on the local police blotter for a while before having him handle international relations, but that’s because I’m an old man and I prize experience. Having him pretend to be an expert is simply dishonest and it makes it impossible for me to take him seriously in any capacity.My view on Ukraine is we have some obligation to fix it up, after having broken it. Team Obama let the State Department run wild and Ukraine is one result. That said, I reject the whole Putin as Hitler narrative. Ukraine is our mess. Putin is more a reactionary than an aggressor. The way to manage him is stop poking him. Since the bunglers in the White House and State Department are locked into this weird 1938 mindset, the world is safer if the Germans and French take over the Ukraine problem.

        Remember Hitchens? Any mediocre British “Intellectual” can hit big in America by his accent alone.

        I used to know a guy, many years ago, who was a news anchor in a top 15 media market- he used to come to our parties; we invited him, not because he was a local celeb, (well, kinda because he was a local celeb) but because he was funny. He was also very good looking, and the sweet young things that gathered around him were all googly eyed at the prospect of the great “Mr. Anchorman” taking the time to talk to them. I remember one sweet young thing remarking “My, it must be interesting to be a journalist!” Mr. Anchorman cocked a wry smile and said ” Yes, I’m sure it must be. You should go ask one- I just read the news.” Not many of him around today!

            I think the Brits have it right by calling them “news presenters” and “news readers.” I like the phrase “TV presenter” as well. It drains all the enchantment from the job. In America, we have allowed news reporting to turn into a religious calling with magical qualities. As a result I don’t think the typical American appreciates the dimness of most of these folks.
