        Today’s early AM arrest of Roger Stone at the hands of heavily-armed Feds and a CNN film crew means the Deep State is totally and completely in charge.  And they mean serious, deadly business.
God help us.

            It’s a message that they’re going to do whatever they want to whoever they want. You’re not longer living in America as it was intended and haven’t been for a long while now.
As time continues we will watch a completely tyrannical cabal of nwo communists, globalists, and useful idiots ate here to forcefully takeover.

        The world IS going to hell, Z.
You’ve laid out your position on religion and I get it and respect it. Fact is I used to be an atheist myself and I would laugh like hell at those bible thumping holy rollers that came round trying to recruit for their churches.
I ain’t laughing anymore.

        The assholes at Reason really have ruined the “Libertarian” brand.  In their ever rarer honest moments they admit that open borders without a full dismantling of the welfare state is a horrible idea.
Over the past few years they have really gone off the leftist deep-end.  They chased off most of their readers and contributors.  They are now fully funded by Koch’s and other Chamber of Commerce types.  The result is these kinds of stupid articles jam-packed full of blatant lies.

            Reason is pretty much just the pet project of Koch Industries now. One of the things the owner of the Weekly Standard came to realize is the magazine had no readers and no influence. What was the point of maintaining it? The staff could never come up with an answer, so it was shut down. Right now, National Review is struggling to keep the doors open, because donors are realizing no one pays attention to NRO. They either close or see a change in management this year. I would assume the Kochs are wondering about their commitment to Reason magazine too.

                People are paying attention to NRO for all the wrong reasons, and are now despised by even the moderates to the point that whatever dreck their writers put out actively harm their cause.

        The Left is crazy and can’t square their world view with reality.  That is the light at the end of the tunnel in which we live.  One of our important tasks is to make sure they don’t burn everything down along the way.

        I’m looking forward to the wackiness on today’s Z cast.  And just a reminder to everyone of us on the side of truth to keep mocking the Coalition of the Fringes.  Ridicule is a great weapon for us.

        OT but of rather serious concern…Just read that Nigeria (population 190 million I believe) has officially outlawed homosexuality and all homosexual acts, including mere public expressions of affection between gay people, and claims it will vigorously prosecute.What this means in practical effect is that 190 million Nigerians can now claim to be persecuted homosexuals, and seek asylum in US and Europe.  (Angola, OTOH, has just formally legalized homosexuality, but the “persecuted” “homosexuals” of Nigeria won’t flee to there.)Dollars to donuts the Nigerian govt did this not out of moral outrage, but to set up yet another refugee/remittances racket to bleed the West dry.

            At least they won’t be attacking the white women (much) upon arrival.  Oh wait, you are saying it’s an immigration scam?  They’ll find their inner heterosexuality when they get off the boat?  I can hardly keep up any more.

        I don’t think there should be any goofy majors.  They can exist, but should have to be paired with a conventional major in order to achieve a diploma.  The majors are:Physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, engineering(including all subtypes), classics, philosophy, economics, history.  English is allowable, but must be paired with mastery of a foreign language. (This is what TS Eliot advocated.)

        I often wonder if the current antics of the left are not secretly directed by someone of the Alt-Right. It is hard to believe that they actually think they are advancing their cause: Unless that cause is really to unify those possessed of both sanity and pallor.

        It’s funny that people get angry with Zman for exposing some of the junk science that their children’s tuition is helping to fund. Don’t shoot the messenger! It’s good to know the truth, no matter how infuriating it may be.

            In fairness, I think a lot of male academics just tune out the noise from the gender-grievance crowd. Otherwise, everyday there would be afalling downon campus. Imagine spending years in a series field, doing real academic work knowing there’s a gaggle of goofballs making the same money, writing about their hoo-ha while playing video games.

                The goofballs don’t make the same money. The dirty little secret of these grievance studies departments is that they can be huge profit centers for universities. They usually have a skeletal staff of full, tenured professors who make good money and get the headlines and a slew of Associate Professors who are paid the pittance they deserve. They require no lab space, no specialized equipment, or other expensive capital infrastructure.Idiotic liberal parents pay $50k-$70k/year for this crap. If your grievance study department attracts 100 students/annum at $60k each that’s a revenue stream of $6MM/annum/class, or $24MM/annum for a 4-year program. That’s a pretty tidy profit center.There’s a reason these departments proliferated explosively in the last 20 years–a well run depatment is extremely profitable.

                    The other side of it is the womyn’s studies department is not getting a federal grant to build a robotics lab. They are not getting corporate money for a venture. That grant for the robotic lab to work on a DoD project is manna from heaven. Once the project ends, the university still has the lab. That allows them to bid on new grants from a position of having lower capital costs.I think the reason for the proliferation of fake majors in general is the school debt machine artificially inflating demand. The reason West Virginia offers a physical education major is many of their undergrads are too stupid to do anything else by play dodge ball.

                        I think there is a strong case that academic inflation is what is driving all this credentialism as well as the proliferation of barking crazy degrees. The need to keep the money rolling in is why they have to keep coming up with new, batshit SVW training programmes such as Intersectional Feminist Dance Theory.
It’s a bubble.

                            There are also many people that wouldn’t be able to buckle down and earn a “real” degree (e.g. In the STEM fields).  These sorts of frivolous degrees are made for them.

                Man, you talk about a movie that’s been memoryhole’d. I literally hadn’t thought about that Douglas film in years. There was a stark difference between the Foster character and these academics who tune out the grievance crowd – for Foster the Cold War was over and reality smacked him in the ass. These IRL academics can still keep their head in the sand.

It should not be our job to be electoral cannon fodder so Pierre Omidyar and his fellow oligarchs are not hit by heavy taxation. The future is for conservatives to identify as an ethnocultural group, and seek self-determination either through increased autonomy from Washington or a “Redstan”. And if we must “surrender” then get a better deal than FW DeKlerk.

                The underlying Pew study is blackpilling. 51% of Gen Z Republicans favor “more diversity”, and one-third of Gen Z at-large are pronoun-policing.
A lesson I draw out of this is the need for the right-wing to develop institutions and culture to be anti-assimilation. A lot of our people “want to be left alone”, but end up just conforming to keep social peace.
For starters, if Kamala is installed in 2020, we need to be burning the flag.

        I am not now nor have I ever been a cowboy (or a libertarian), but I know some cowboy libertarians, and they are not open borders fanatics.  Far from it.
They’re out riding fences, working with barbed wire, herding mammals and such.
Would make great camp guards…

            It’s an ugly-ass name befitting an ugly-ass brown person. Only in multicultural shithole does one have to make a correction like this. In a homogeneous society where Harris would be an exception I would be polite enough to learn the correct pronunciation to be polite.

        Regarding the audio quality, it’s much better than a year ago. I would like to hear more limiting/compression to make it easier to understand when there is road noise. That will raise the noise floor, which you can gate if you feel like it. If you have any production software at all you have a compressor/limiter, I’m sure.I love this one:https://www.bozdigitallabs.com/product/the-wall/And his Gatey-Watey is on sale today! (He has a penchant for silly names, but his plugs are unreal!)

        Maybe it’s obvious, but I’m still wrapping my head around the Lefty “morality” idea of Forcing Normie to Agree being Lefty’s entire “morality”. And I wonder if there is a relationship between the weirdos getting weirder and the Lefty “morality”? Nihilism leading to madness.

        Some dindu explained to me awhile ago what it means to “Super Man,” a hoe (female). When she’s in bed with you, asleep, you ejaculate onto her back, then throw your blanket over her shoulders so that the blanket becomes “glued” to her body. When she gets up and walks around the blanket sweeps around behind her, like a super hero’s cape. Voila, that hoe has been superman’d.
Not quite Nietzsche.
