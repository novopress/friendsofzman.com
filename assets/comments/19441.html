        “All over in dissident politics are men who would have been in management tracks, partner tracks and tenure tracks. Instead they are working outside that system and exercising their minds in dissident politics.”
And that is why I am here. Our ranks are filling.
Somewhere In Vermont tonight a random multi-millionaire banker — with his Xanax-popping kids on break from Dalton in the other suite — on his $15K ski vacation will have a brief nightmare showing him his future. It’s coming.

            $15K is a relatively cheap ski vacation. Just sayin’.

            Same here, AR.Schadenfreude over a hypothetical banker losing sleep over his fallen soufflé of status is a pleasant bit of daydreaming.But my own 3 AM anxiety over my fledgling household economics of an already displaced tends to overshadow.Most of my old colleagues in the moneyed world don’t seem to be losing much sleep.Sure, they are probably miserable shits most of the time, but they have already siphoned enough from the system to insulate from all but the social tumble of a worst-case scenario.For me, working outside the system has been liberating and spiritually enriching, but has come with its own set of challenges and limitations. And its often lonely.There is nothing new about the inherent trade-offs in life, but the limitations and real risk in terms of economic viability and off-the-books nature of separation makes the necessity of community even more pressing.Building community must include an economic engine. Preference for ones people must extend beyond a social support network.For me, the difficulty of forging social bonds has only been outmatched by the difficulty of creating economic production outside the system.People a lot smarter than me will hopefully see the economic opportunity of appealing to the ronin and other atomized dissidents to forge the grassroots economic bonds that will ease the pain of separation and cultivate growth for those already outside.Perhaps it is a matter of opportunity out of necessity; that more pain is required. But I think there is already plenty of room for a more proactive approach.So much untapped or otherwise wasted generative potential awaits.In the meantime, I am trying to get my girlfriend to wean herself off the Bezos garage sale. Therein lies part of the challenge. The “System” has its tendrils entwined deeply into average jane and joe.

                Good points, Screwtape. Dissidents have their work cut out for them: a social support network, sure, bring it on. But that’s not enough. A countervailingeconomyis also imperative. Dissidence cannot live by brotherhood and sisterhood alone.We should learn something from the ’60s counterculture, which I was once part of. I’ve come to despise most of its value system, but (slag me for this if you must) it was successful in one way: as the name implies, it was a subculture, deep and fairly wide. You could believe you were an integral part of something thatmattered.You weren’t alone in “dropping out” from the establishment.But, as soon became evident, that wasn’t enough. The counterculture flamed out because it never solved the problem of economics. At first there was a naïve reliance on bartering — you traded the turnips you raised in your home garden for the mechanic’s labor fixing your VW bus. Hah. If the mechanic didn’t need your turnips, you were SOL. The other briefly prevalent idea was that the straight world was so wasteful that you could live on what it discarded. That not only didn’t work, it depended on the capitalist world to prevail and overproduce, which is what the hip generation was supposed to replace.“Our thing” mustn’t make the same mistake. It can’t just be a political movement or a social movement. It must have an economic backbone, and not one based on fantasies. A tall order. It’s not too early to think about it.

                There are some promising new things that could help detach people from the machine. Re-shoring and decentralizing manufacturing with 3D printing has been talked about but so far 3D printers haven’t been used for much more than making toys and prototypes. That could change as it becomes possible to print electrical circuits into the printed objects. There’s also a new thing that even surprised me which is the “open source hardware” movement and the development of a new open instruction set called RISC-5 for microprocessors. Think of it as the AR-15 of instruction sets. A breakthrough in graphene research could eventually make do-it-yourself VLSI possible too. We need people on our side who can out-bug the bugmen!One possible source of large scale funding for us might be the development of the “dissident cloud”. Generally, I like the idea of cloud computing. It simplifies backup and reduces the need for high priced desktops and laptops. What I don’t like is the idea of letting Comrade Google and Supreme Soviet Zuckerberg wander through my files… I can’t be the only one who feels this way right? Lots of normies don’t trust those bastards either and that could be a way to introduce them to crimethink and hatefacts.

                    A “made in U.S.A.” only version of Amazon would be nice.  A phone, search engine and operating system specifically designed to not follow you around and sell your data would be great as well.  These sorts of things aren’t being offered, and a minority of consumers would be all over them, if they were available.

                        The operating system part is already there. It’s called Linux and I urge everyone to use it. It’s open source so you can check it to make sure it isn’t sending your data to the FBI or Jeff Bezos. If you still aren’t satisfied you can modify it yourself to lock it down more and in fact there are “paranoid” distributions that do just that with security levels turned up to 11 and everything encrypted by default. The only problems are that a (thankfully shrinking) pool of peripherals require closed source drivers to work on Linux. In that case it helps to keep in mind that the Linux kernel (the main part of the OS) will not share things with the driver that aren’t required to operate the device.The modern distributions like Ubuntu* are as easy to install as Windows and if you don’t feel like installing it you can now buy it pre-installed from several PC vendors, Dell and System 76 come to mind. There’s also a new Linux phone coming out or already out but I don’t know much about it.* So there is poz afoot here. Ubuntu is a Bantu word that Wikipedia says this about “Ubuntu is named after the African philosophy of ubuntu, which Canonical translates as “humanity to others” or “I am what I am because of who we all are”.[6]”. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu) Now if you think about that last bit a while though it’s actually pretty ironic that Lefties like the idea. Anyway, it’s important to make the distinction between the *distribution* of Linux (a large package of apps and utilities bundled with it) and the *kernel* (the actual OS that makes the computer run). The kernel is copyrighted by Linux Torvalds. He’s an interesting guy and has run afoul of the SJWs for still acting too much like a man. I won’t claim him as ours but he’s a Finn. You know. Anyway, the people who package Linux into distributions are often pozzed but anyone can make their own distro and lots of them are put together by the usual cyber-libertarian types, some of whom are drifting our way.

Jane has the biggest problem and will be the hardest to wean.   It never occurs to most men I know to do anything but drive to O’Reilly’s.

                    Last night I watched a YouTube video before bed about how the Amazon Ring (a sort of talking security camera hooked to the internet so you can watch Tasheeka rob your house while you’re at work earning the money to pay for it) has been hacked. The hackers were apparently more 4Chan than Al Qaeda types and were using it to make rude comments to the owners saying things like “you really need to hit the gym fatso”. A person’s gullibility with regard to inviting the Big Tech octopus into their homes and lives is rapidly becoming a kind of litmus test to see how far gone they are and if it’s worth spending time to wake them up.

        From my working class view the lions share of the smart people are either in the dissident right or moving towards it.  The left media, academia and politics “this includes Republican politicians” are morons compared to the people in our sphere.  I don’t think this is going to shape up quite the way the oligarchs expect.

                It’s because they have resigned themselves to following a script designed to mock and destroy people such as themselves, but they are content to suck the teat along the way.  The bit about agreeing to things they know are not true, in order to break their spirit and humanity.

                Think football. Which fan gets the camera’s attention, the normal enthusiastic rooter cheering when his team makes a good play, or the otherwise normal guy who paints his face, strips to the waist in sub-zero temperatures and waves some sign while continuously shouting like a lunatic?
Thus, a panel on CNN.

                Correct. Karl Marx’s concentration of capital theories have been debunked long ago. In addition, we used to have anti-trust and monopoly laws and they used to be enforced. As we have been seeing lately though, with such things as that fake impeachment, the gun grab in Virginia, and the utter lack of enforcement of our immigration laws – the elites are making new law on the fly, and letting others fall by the wayside – without any regard as to whether it will fly or not. If you keep changing the rules of the game – eventually the people will too, or they’ll go Galt. We already have the most severe and dire form of it happening now with our swelling ranks of cellar dwelling young men, the MGTOW movement, and minimalism. This is not good.I predict an exponential growth of dissident politics and the fallout is going to be epic. I think it was our esteemed blog host that once noted that when you get a lot of smart white men pished off and marginalized… very bad things happen.Unless we get control of our women, I see either fascism or socialism ahead. And just for the record, the socialists killed far more Joos and regular people than the fascists did in WW2.Make your mistake, America.

                Well said sir! Shortly before I gave up on Facebook a year ago I posted something like this regarding the then-possible Trump impeachment: ” it takes 2/3 of the Senate to remove from office. If the US Senate ever leans 2/3 Democrats we shall have worse problems than a corrupt president.” 😲

            you might as well label them the ass-hole class, since that’s how they all act.   I always thought to myself while reading about some insurance company moving their call center off shore — who do they think is going to be buying insurance?!

            Not so fast.  In a sane world, there would be a genuine honest (just much smaller) place for actual lawyers who practiced actual law, professors who taught real subjects (we will always need properly educated men to pass down real knowledge to younger generations), and managers who sensibly manage real, actual projects.  The problem Z describes is not that one; it is the problem that the frauds in each of these professions are consolidating their fraudulent power base over their fellow frauds — viz this culling will not result in fewer professors of nonsense, it will simply produce fewer /tenured/ professors of nonsense, and the others will live a ratty Bob Cratchit-like life in the adjunct prof shadows.  No great readjustment, just a rearrangement of the power structure.Communism always produces a tiny inner ruling claque rather than the equality they squawk about: in his secret dreams, each Communist thinks that after the revolution, he will not be a factory drone enjoying better work conditions and a share in shop-floor management, he thinks he will be a commissar or a Politburo member with a dacha and a chauffeur.  This was the great appeal of Communism to Jews, rather than say Fabianism or old-fashioned labor reform.  They didn’t care about the masses, Communism was just a better ticket to Insider status.  At the Catholic Worker, you had to rub shoulders with, ugh, actual workers, and do actual work, rather than debate theory — which, as they put it, was Labor Too, Just Intellectual Labor.  Funny how that always works out.As to the law, we would have a much better system if we got rid of stare decisis entirely, and just got back to wholesale black-letter law, directly adjudged by judges who had proven they were capable of judgment.  More than anything else it is stare decisis and the burden of Byzantine case law and precedent systems which have turned law into a zany priesthood rather than an actual process of adjudication.  As usual, who benefits most from the Talmudification of a profession rather than a clear-minded plain spoken process which a yeoman can understand with his own two ears.

            If  they grew up in the housing/education bubble and were promised a respectable career in exchange for good grades in school, then yes shed a tear for them. The mechanics and electricians and carpenters back then were the lazy, dull students who didn’t grind through their classes and were disrespectful towards authority.
Millennials were and are owed good jobs based on the information set they had available growing up. Generation Z has different and better information.

                    The kids don’t deserve a living – they deserve the right to MAKE a living. The boomers have pissed that away before they could even vote and now it’s too late. If you look at the billionaires and millionaires responsible… welp… they are all pretty much leading edge boomers, and they are still making the same empty promises to young people. And some of them are so desperate and hopeless that they are getting suckered.

                    When I was in school, the only people lower than the trade school crowd were the punks who wanted to join the military. Every serious student went to college back then and had every reason to expect to be treated fairly in exchange for their hard work.
People would be far more sympathetic to capitalism if businesses actually interacted with schools, although that’s not even remotely as important now as it was back then.

                        Dear Sir, you must be very old school. That was back in the days when colleges or correctly the degree actually meant something. Nowadays It has been watered down so much the college degree doesn’t mean much. Maybe a technical degree but anything else? Unlikely. Trade schools? All those jobs are being done by illegal immigrants or their children. The military? Perhaps long ago it was they recruited dullards, but if you research today they only want smarter people. The military is really hurting for qualified people. About 22% of applicants are too stupid. 10% too criminal. About 50% have health problems which usually means they’re fat slobs.

                My grandfather, the young itinerant ranch and farm hand, came out of WW1 as a cavalryman (horse riding soldier—not much call for that), and learned the electrical trade out of a matchbook-advertising correspondence school after the war.  Made a nice, but modest, living, electrifying the city of Whittier, CA, as an independent businessman, hiring and directing a small local work force.  That kind of work flies under the cultural radar, but it’s out there.

                        True , but for a fair price, EVERY single person I know would rather have the work done directly from an American citizen/resident who is licensed bonded and insured.   If Pablo’s work falls apart, there is no one to call.  Pablo is long gone.My electrician is booked out 4 months and I practically have to beg him to do anything.  To be honest, I give him credit for forcing me to develop basic electrical skills.The shock and awe my fellow doctors had when told hem that I moved an electrical outlet by myself (because I couldn’t get an electrician to my house)  from the floor to behind the flat screen TV hanging on the wall….it was a sight to behold. lol

Heh. BTD (much less than) T. It was a thing of wonder when I changed a flat tireall by myself, like a big boyin the office parking lot. I could understand (though not agree with) an argument such as “it’s not a good use of my time, economically speaking” but was amused/saddened by the “it’s too complicated/dangerous” excuse.
“Um, you spent last night on call placing freaking hemodialysis catheters. In what possible way is that less difficult/dangerous?”

                    fair enough.  But would you not agree that more men should consider learning a good trade such as A/c, electrical, master woodworking, plumbing, automotive?   Plenty of good work out there.
I will say the carpenter who  repaired our library shelving rolls in a beautiful souped up F-150 and is more than likely making 300-400k per year.  He’s is the most unreliable guy I have ever met.  Fortunately, he is really good at his work and a nice guy….but he certainly is NOT cheap.

                This is the typical ‘boomercon civnat’ attitude. Just ‘pull yourself up by your bootstraps’. Wife and I are friends with a couple who is currently going through bankruptcy because his trades business cannot compete with the guys paying illegals to do the work under the table. He tried to do the right thing, paying Americans to do the work, and now his young children and his wife are going to lose their business and probably their house as well because of people hiring illegal labor.“all they have to do” is easy to say. But try to actually do it, see how far it gets you.

        This topic is probably the most important one for heritage Americans and the one that infuriates me most about my generation cohort.Back in the day I attended Ivy League graduate school in the liberal arts area. I came from the lower middle class and a whole new world opened up for me. Long story short the march to PhD, then through tenure indoctrination, to publish or perish began to lose its allure and I left to pursue different fields over the following years.I had always enjoyed teaching so my last FT career was in community college in a completely different field. Back in the day CC seemed like a joke arena where anyone who could walk and chew gum at the same time could probably get a position in admin or teaching.  When I came in it was getting much harder and when I left it was extremely competitive.A phenomenon that completely floored me was sitting on hiring committees and watching 50 and 60 year old whites feeling so righteous giving positions to AA POCs who rarely were the most qualified. You could just feel the pretentious virtue oozing in the room.When I would ask them where their children, especially male children who were at the bottom of the totem pole for getting hired, would get jobs I would always get the dazed deer in the headlight look and no reply.This is in Cali where the pay, benefits, and pensions for these jobs are absurdly high. Do these people hate their own children so much that they don’t care?  And more importantly don’t these children, especially the males, see that they have been abandoned?  This is the cohort who should be easily drawn into the dissident pool.It has been instructive watching the retired white CC professors go off to Europe (oddly enough never Africa, the ME, or South America) on vacation several times a year while many of their children still live at home trying to get upper middle class jobs.

            Not surprisingly, Kalizuela’s educational system has cratered from the best in the country to the worst.   I would say I look forward to Kalizuela’s collapse but the disease that infects that state has spread throughout the country.

            Once you see it you can’t unsee it.
It’s sad that a large number in the USA, and a vast majority (in Canada) are simply unfit to survive and will be extinct in several generations due to childlessness or genocide.
But you are right, the zealotry of the actual Dissidents suggest that there will be a strong contingent of whites hanging on regardless of what the world does. One can hope that the inherent Anglo obsessive fad mindset (Puritans, Victorians, SJW, diversity) might actually be a good thing for once.

                Diversity and SJW are not inherent Anglo obsessions. For the most part they were deliberately inserted into the West by the usual suspects. As someone linked the following the other day. (Sorry, I forget who it was, and too lazy to go search, no slight intended.)

        The word “efficiency” has a positive connotation that needs to be reevaluated.  Household efficiency is a far different thing from capitalistic or governmental efficiency.  Putting all business under the Amazon umbrella or all government under a dictator would be wonderfully efficient when measured in dollars/cents.  Efficiency is ultimately a philosophical question for a community and culture; unfortunately American culture has knee-jerk instincts for “cheaper is better” and “my kids need a college education to compete.”As a response to the rush over the efficiency cliff, we dissidents need to steer our smart children toward the trades.  Lawyers will consolidate – plumbers and HVAC techs will not.  I once struck up a conversation with a sharp, well-read young guy who owned a septic-pumping business.  The guy was killing it.  Bought a $5K truck out of high school and went to work … by the time he was 30 he had a debt-free s#*t-pumping business with a number of trucks and employees.  The guy was laughing about how little competition he had.  He took his family to Italy last year.We need to take our dissidence in politics and manifest that contrariness in day-to-day life.  The point isn’t that we all need to be in the crap-pumping business, but that we go where the lemmings aren’t.

            I agree with the trades track and then opening your own business as the best viable route for most young white males.But there is only so much time. Here in Cali it is getting close to being too late for this.The legal and illegal Latinos started out as trade workers and now many own their own businesses. They, and most of the white business owners, primarily/only hire illegals, pay them little, and usually classify them as independent contractors.Additionally Latinos generally appear to having an aversion to paying taxes, getting insured, etc. There are two sets of rules in Cali. One set for the chump white man following rules and regulations and one set for the Latinos who often get paid in cash and do not follow the rules and regulations.And the politicians and the courts love the recently arrived immigrants who are “really more American” than heritage Americans and get away with much of what they do.

                    Capt:  Cali is gone.I would love to be gone from Cali but I am a new convert to the dissident church and for most of my immediate family this is “problematic” as the academics say.So I stay here to try to protect them. I am making hopeful plans to move but certain economic stars must align first to be able to leave without financially  hurting them. So for now my solace is to travel to see a few old friends who are awake a couple of times a year.Growing up I lived all over the US (and other countries) and from what I can tell from your posts I have lived not to far from where you are. The boys I played football with there were as tough as they come and even as young men some grew and hunted food for their families and a little extra cash. You are in a good place.We will see about me and mine. Maybe everything will turn out swell.

                You make an interesting point. If it is true, that might be an opening for a enterprising white man with money to hire a Latino to head an 8A firm. You could even insist on some white people being hired. Diversity and all that.

            Captain S: Just compared in my phone book (YES! I still use a paper phonebook)  the number of attorneys vs. the number of septic pumpers.
Fifteen pages of lawyers, many of them full page ads.Two small listings of septic pumpers.
Small community, small phone book, but that is a huge difference.  The competition in the lawyer business must be brutal.

            Absolutely correct about the trades. I have a nephew who started on the college route, with a full-scholarship is sportsball. Finally realized how much he hated college (and didn’t much care for sportsball anymore). Quit. Went the HVAC route, which he loves. Got the necessary certs, excelled at his job and will be opening his own company soon.At the ripe old age of 21, just bought his first (modest, but nice) house and has no financial worries at all. Confident, good-looking, athletic and loyal to those who’ve helped him along the way. Also, the young, smart and very pretty girls adore him. He is a perfect example of what young men should strive for.The more young men like him I encounter, the more hopeful for our future I become.

                In the STEM field, go for the lab skills, not the report writing.  Lab techs are in huge demand, because most college graduates in the hard sciences know their theoretical stuff, but they don’t know how to properly operate sophisticated lab equipment.  Lovely Dutch daughter is killing it in high-tech bio lab technical work (the plumbers and, well, linemen, of biology) while most of her schoolmates have nothing going on.

                    I’m a clinical lab tech myself. We have a very serious shortage of qualified people to fill the available positions. You are completely correct in your assessment about the theoretical science types, even the ones in the applied sciences. To be fair though, nearly anyone who can work with lab equipment of any kind, can quickly learn other kinds.Also, there just aren’t that many schools with clinical laboratory science programs. At this time, most of the qualified lab techs are coming out of the military, who are graduating ~40-50 techs per month combined. Unlike most other college science programs, the Medical Laboratory Science programs are more accurately viewed as “trade schools”. BTW, Canada has a much better approach, treating it as a vocational program, with the option of getting the BS with additional coursework. Unlike the US, the BS is NOT required for the professional license.

            Link this problem to the tandem problem of roping our women under control.I’m a chick and didn’t start career building until Daughter was on her own out of the house. I was 45 when I hit my stride. Plus I went into The Trades—water treatment-systems water quality-water distribution-hydroelectric dam operator.  I tried like crazy to entice other women into these job fields. A few women in water treatment and water quality.  Only one nibble for distribution-hydro dam and she hadn’t passed the certifications yet.Women–Raise your children then career build. Plus women freak out about working graveyard shift or changing shifts. Swing shift is sweet. Talk about Weak Soy Girls. While I was at the water company diligently demonstrating upward mobility, women in the company were shrieking they weren’t paid the same as evil men! Yes we are! Do Mike Rowe’s Dirty Jobs and you’ll be paid the same!  And don’t cop an attitude.  Men don’t like that and won’t work well with you. To get Respect, work hard and don’t yammer.

                RFF, Lovely Dutch Daughter found that the second and third shifts are where all the good people are (these labs go 24/7).  Weekday first shift is where all the climbers to management and all the suck up hacks live, and the 2nd/3rd-shift people hate being called in to fix the problems the 1st shifters create.  3rd shift is where the “best”, most dissident people dwell, but going in to work at 10 p.m. is a bit much for her right now.

We had 12 hour days/on 2 days off 2 day/Sweet!….the first day is “Monday” and I fix what the 2 day On before me slightly goofed up…the second day is “Friday” time for 2 days off. I was spoiled. No one in Distribution wanted a Mgmt job. A good job was finally getting a transfer to upcountry dams in the Motherlode. If I had started career building earlier, to end career transferred upcountry is very sweet.Working Distribution is like working with high level Aspie or Autistics as most of the guys had big engineering brains, Did Not Talk, weren’t social except to give turnover and talking to them annoyed them mightly. An then in walked me.

                We men dislike that attitude in other men just as much as we dislike it in women. Actually,  probably more so, as we’ve had to accept that many women just come with that attitude and current workplace culture requires that we deal with it. Other men? Not so much.

            Yes. I know a consultant to Big Oil, a petrophysicist raking home an easy $5 million in a good year. He told me he was on the golf course, playing some dude he’d met in the club house. The guy was a mason, made a grand living by buying houses, fixing them up and flipping them, he had 45 employees. He pointed to a billboard on the edge of the golf course; “That’s my company right there.”That’s what I would do if I got a do-over: learn a trade and how to cook my own book, so I won’t need an accountant and know what’s going on in my business.

        Isn’t it interesting how capitalism and socialism lead to the same place?  The main difference being how you pick your rulers. Economic power vs. political power.
It’s no surprise there are so many crypto-monarchists on the DR given how it is largely a reaction against economic power. Not judging, just observing.

                And I’m willing to listen to their arguments.  Supposedly the traditional arrangement is the king &amp; the people opposing the nobility.
Is monarchy democracy in the person of a king?  Is a republic rule by aristocracy?  The king needs the people to check the aristocracy, the aristocrats want to be the new king. Things I wonder about.

            Capitalism enriches the middle class along the way, before it impoverishes most.  Socialism enriches the lower class along the way, before it impoverishes most.  The end game is the problem, which comes up more quickly and severely under Socialism, but we appear to be in a sort of an end game now.

            The standard line defenders of liberalism use is, “Democracy protects your civil rights from evil kings.”
Once you realize they were wrong about your civil rights, you question whether monarchy was as evil as its enemies claim it is.
The root issue is the false god of equality and his prophet envy.  As C. S. Lewis observed in the Screwtape Lettters, someone who says, “I am as good as you!” does not believe it.  Nietzsche would hasten to add that only the weak are concerned with fairness and equality. Accept those 2 truths and we can kill this god.

            Either philosophy raised to the height of moral or governmental purpose leads nowhere good. They are ideas about the most efficient way of creating and distributing goods. While goods must be made and distributed that is not the purpose of government, just one aspect of it.
Efficiency loves consolidation, it’s just that efficiency isn’t the only thing important to a safe and prosperous society.

            Agree that this is a great point, but we’ve also learned that it’s pointless to kick-the-can over to the Feds or state government, hoping for reform.  Anti-trust can work in a country united by common traditions, common ethics, and common-law, all of which we’ve lost since Teddy’s era.The best anti-trust policy is for individual households to go subversive with their personal economic policy.  We can choose online alternatives like Etsy or DuckDuckGo.  Subversive households combine to make subversive communities; communities combine to make subversive counties, and counties have the wherewithal to influence a state’s economy.  We don’t just need 2A sanctuary counties … we need counties that will stop selling out to corporatism along with the big tax-breaks they give to Big-Box stores and fast-food chains.  But it all starts with the daily decisions of the individual dissident.

                A small aspect of Zman’s larger take and riffing off Capt. S Etsy comment… there is a massive desire for unusual, quality, cottage industry product… particularly traditionally made goods out there. I see it as a bellwether of deeper desires.I’ve a friend who makes leather goods. His spare moments from his low six figure job are filled with hand stitching leather items. He can’t keep up with demand. He committed to so many projects that in an attempt to simply clamp down future orders and get a break.. he raised his prices ridiculously. Or that was the plan at least. When I asked him later if  it had given him his much desired break he wide-eyed exclaimed that it hadn’t created even a ripple of tranquility. His orders were still coming in gangbusters.My point is that there are larger forces at work here.  My friend isn’t the only artisan I know experiencing this. I know that vintage clothing is highly sought after as well as finely made reproductions. Mom and pop foods are a thing. People are taking pride in saying, “I know the guy that made this…” I cheer when I see these little hippy types protesting the opening of yet another Starbucks.Sure some of it is people being trendy but there is a deep desire within people for things that aren’t massed produced. Aren’t slapped together by Nguyen in a sweat shop. Aren’t selected from Amazon. Aren’t as P.K. Dick said garbage on it’s way to becoming “kibble” again… but are made to last.I’m hopeful that this desire is something Our People may capitalize on. Not just in the monetary sense, rather, capitalize on the growing dissatisfaction with globalization, on the emptiness of materialism, the detachment of being a speck in a sea of foreigners flooding their land.The mortar has become friable. There is opportunity for Us there. Let’s begin pulling as many salvageable bricks as we can from the sad old decaying wall and use them to build something new.

        It’s not just the power and wealth concentrating in the hands of the few. It’s that the few either don’t see themselves as part of the masses or are in fact a different tribe than the masses.
Regardless, it’s when the masses start getting 115-130 IQ guys to give them direction that things start getting interesting.

Still feel powerless. I just subtly drop redpills in social settings to other young white people. Hard to know what else to do. They listen and I try to lead by example.
But you are right. When a white guy of 95-100 IQ sees a guy of 120 IQ is actually in his corner, he fucking listens. They wake up more easily. I know i sound arrogant but it’s true from my experience.

                    I feel like I’m stalking you today in the comments — not intentional — but what the hell. Now I barely know anything about you, but I would suspect it’s not your IQ but behavior people are responding to.Be the level headed guy who gives honest opinions and straight answers, when he has an answer, and admits it when he doesn’t. Be the guy people can depend on, whose word is known to be good. Help those who ask for help. Make time to listen to people’s problems, but call them on it when they whine, and be supportive in general. Always strive to be honest and straightforward — without being cruel. Treat each person as if their dignity matters, and show respect for their expertise and efforts. Ultimately, results matter most, but good intent and sincerity deserve at least recognition, if not necessarily reward. If you have a supervisory role, praise in public, chew out in private.By doing stuff such as the above you’re building community of a sort. I think so many people today, especially younger whites who have been told their whole lives that they are inherently bad and guilty, are desperately looking for community, a figurative place to belong. My guess isthat’swhat people are responding to.

            I always marvel at how it goes un-Noticed how many lawyers were in the Sons of Liberty, the jacobins, and the falangists.  There is something about practicing law that seems to have a particular likelihood of redpilling our forefathers into hoisting the black flag and applying the National Razor.

        I call it the Big Squeeze.  Corporate consolidation squeezing out the smaller companies, squeezing out their suppliers’ profits, squeezing out their payroll by hiring cheaper foreigners, squeezing out the tax base for communities, and on and on it goes.  But they sure are lean and cost-efficient aren’t they?

        I am not as well read as the majority of commenters on this site, being an autodidact without formal secondary education, but what I have to say is a little off topic.I believe that what happens in Virginia in the coming months will dictate the future events in this county for a number of years to come if not indefinitely. If the bluster coming out of the dissident right concerning draconian gun control measures in the state is indeed just talk with no follow up action, then the rest of the states will fall like dominoes in its wake.I don’t think that we as free men realize that this is truly a watershed moment in the communists long march through our society. If the rest of the country stands by and does nothing to help our brothers in the event that things become kinetic over this raw power grab by the communists then I think it is truly the end for us as white men in this country and by extrapolation, the world.I have about made up my mind that it is time to jump off of the porch and run with the big dogs.

            Initially, I thought the confiscatory laws in Virginia were insane, but now I believe they are a test case. The progs have a wealthy, professional class base in NoVa that will support whatever the government chooses to do, with the proximity of considerable military and agency paramilitary assets  (probably more reliable) if they need to go posse commitatus.
How this shakes out will determine much.

                Those military assets would have to have the go-ahead from Trump to interfere in Virginia on behalf of the gun-grabbers.  That’s not going to happen.

        The financialization of our economy is producing monopolies and skimming operations benefiting the international corporations and the elite.Our government not only does not protect our borders it also fails to protect us from predatory capitalism.Here in my midwestern city MasterCard has a huge processing center and middle  class American  jobs are being picked off and the same job shows up in India. Or Indians with temp visa’s are brought in here to compete for good jobs.Dentistry is another profession that I have noticed that is being consolidated under corporatism. You go in for a dental checkup and it becomes a competition on how much dental work you don’t need being pitched at you just to increase the bottom lines.Fewer dentists are believable anymore , half of them are running corporate  up selling scams.Our whole system is increasingly  predatory and monopolistic.

            As a person working with clients in a “white-collar professional” field (helping them get taken care of without their getting scalped by the corporate behemoth, is how I see my job), the near future is working that interface between the people and the borg.  It appears my older lawyer and doctor colleagues are doing the same thing, trying to take care of their clients and patients, while corporate consolidation of their professions claw at their practices from the other side. The long term result and goal of all of this is to take the actual nuts and bolts of our work out of our hands and throw it into some sort of database.  It’s a losing battle over time, as big business will roll it up in any case, through litigation, liability, and the law.What is happening is that the divide between the few “good” jobs and the not-good rest of them, is that the “good” job is rolled up with health care benefits, retirement benefits, and liability protection from the law, including product failure and labor law (note how no one is held responsible at Boeing for planes falling out of the sky or for outsourcing critical work to Bangalore; the CEO leaving with his tens of millions doesn’t count).  Amazon execs vs. Amazon employees.  Hospital execs vs. contracted doctors.  Law partners vs. paralegals.  Tenured educators vs. grad student instructors.  The middle is failing, and only skilled work in demand and not vulnerable to being outsourced to India, to desperate and fairly unskilled people that can easily be trained or who can fake it, or to a computer program, is safe.  Family businesses, catering to anyone other than the immediate neighborhoods they serve, will be liabilitied and litigated out of business.  Small business can operate as cash-only and employees do not get the broader benefits package.    The feudal structure is well on its way back, operating behind a red white and blue facade.  The trick, at the micro level, is to fill critical, non-substitutable positions, thereby capturing the pay and benefits that come from working for the borg, but not being held hostage to it.  Ask Lineman for details on how that works.  We need to be smart and calculating about this for our own families, because shouting into the gale wind about the unfairness of it all accomplishes nothing.

        Listened to a number of Millennialyules over the break.  There seems to be a white/black pill divide that is reflective of what kind of dissent you are.All of the guys who do this for a living or spend very little time around normies are black pilled. The exception to this is Greg Johnston.Working class guys who’ve had their trade gutted are black pilled but are eager to break out of the catacombs.  These are men of action and tired of circling the wagons. They are running out of patience.  Mark Collett is curbing this energy into something useful.White professionals and the 2nd tier white managerial class are beginning to talk amongst themselves about how far things have deteriorated and how much longer THEY are going to stand aside and do nothing. So far it’s do nothing…but there is a conversation taking place. I’ve heard a lot of dissent vocabulary coming out of the mouths of normies.  Are they crypto dissidents or have things become so obvious that the chickens are coming home to roost?The puppeteers also seem a lot more nervous.The coming election will probably open up a lot of doors.

                Meme,
We’re literally at the very beginning of a long journey. Think of whites as someone who was in a very deep sleep and are just getting woken up. They barely know where they are. We need to be there at the bedside calmly telling them what’s happening, letting them know the house is on fire.
Btw, we won’t save the house. We won’t even save a good number of whites living in the house. But we can save some so that someday, long after we’re gone, they can build again.

            Blackpill comment but Canadians (Ontarians) are just as stupid and naive as ever. However i am encouraged during my trips to the USA. Something is seriously wrong in Canadian and New Zealand brains. Aus and USA brains seem much stronger.

            I vote for “things become so obvious”.It’s been fascinating to observe that many persons, who would have been solid straight-ticket Democrats 20 or so years ago, are now saying, “Trump may be an asshole, but he’s all we’ve got now.” I know many Z readers have problems with Trump, but what these persons are really saying is not about Trump, if you take my meaning.The thing that really has been eye-opening is how many white people are now willing to openly criticize and oppose “affirmative action” and similar race-based (or deviance-based) quota systems. Of course I am priming the pump by saying openly what *I* think about sacred Diversity, but still, it is hopeful. And yes, the puppeteers ARE nervous. Because when the average guy rejects the myth of the eternally victimized negro (or Muslim, or homosexual), what OTHER story of eternal victimhood might be up for examination and rejection next?

        The most interesting take for me is this:” All over in dissident politics are men who would have been in management tracks, partner tracks and tenure tracks. Instead they are working outside that system and exercising their minds in dissident politics.”
If so, much to hope for from that.

            Seems like they are resurrecting Obama policy implemented toward the end of his tenure through HUD.  Policy was reversed by current HUD Director under Trump.  More magic dirt theory.  Poor people will become less dysfunctional if they are introduced to Whites—like next door neighbors.  🙁This article also seems to dove tail with postings by Z-man concerning the ”monetization of social capital”.  There will be no shortage of developers I’m sure who will be happy to built such high density-low cost housing in the middle of once peaceful communities—after which schools will less effective, and more chaotic, neighborhood crime will increase, gangs appear where there once were none, general community deterioration to set in.Developers of course will take their money an run.  They and their children will never feel the effects of their treachery.

                My county was the one where the County Exec chose to go toe to toe with Obama’s HUD.  It was ugly.  Our little village was told by HUD that it was deficient by a number of units equivalent to five years total budget.  And yes the plan was to supersede local zoning and allow multi-family to be parked anywhere land was available, including purchasing and demolishing single family dwellings.

            I think this issue of state mandated zoning taking over from local zoning control may be where the madness could possibly stop. Because if not here then we become Brazil rapidly. Although the odds are we become Brazil.This is literally the last pretzel bending technique for upper middle class whites to escape diversity while pretending they are living in an area because it “magically is a good area” while not admitting why.If this central state governing takeover happens there are no more places “to white flight to.”  I am sure certain places like Malibu has the money and muscle to fight it but most places will not.The goodwhites will not be amused and will be stunned to see that they are as disposable as the deplorable working class whites whom they have gladly sacrificed on the alter of their multicultural religion.

        Another thing killing the malls is out of control black youth fighting and causing mayhem in the malls.  Women love shopping. They love trying on clothes and do it as a pastime.  But a lot of the malls are no longer safe orderly places.  The black youth menace these malls more or less unchallenged.  No clerk or security guard wants to be the next twitter star picking on black “teen” shoppers for no reason whatsoever.  When things get so bad that the police need to be called, the cops round them up, call a bus, put them on the bus for free and send them home. Nobody gets arrested and if some “kid” fights with the cops, the “kid” will get arrested, then the charges get dropped.  This happens over and over and over.This is not even taking all the shoplifting into consideration.  This is why so many stores in black neighborhoods close.  Between the stealing, the lawsuits and the mayhem, they inevitable close.

        Z Man;Another insightful essay with some pretty clear takeaways.Upper Middle Class consolidation might well be the semi-hidden driving factor in the ever-changing SJW virtue stack competition.  Likewise it can explain the baffling millenarian cult that is today’s Progressivism: ‘Obey enthusiastically or be forever cast into the outer darkness that is Flyover’.Obey what_?  If you have to ask, you’re dangerously close to expulsion.  Just follow the school like a good little fish and maybe the barracuda of downsizing won’t get you.  In nature fish follow the school by being hyper-alert to and rapidly mimicking the movements of their immediate neighbors.  Actually doesn’t take a lot of intelligence.  Seems to work like that in most every pozzed organization now too.It is a fact of human nature that there will always be competition for the big three, namely power, sex and money, and for the ‘one ring that binds them all’, namely high social status.  Status is always a function of status inheritance, merit and politics.  One of the three factors usually predominates.In a regime of consolidation, status inheritance is necessarily devalued: Many more would-be inheritors than there are high-status slots to be passed on.  So, either merit or politics will necessarily emerge as primary means of competition.In the previous regime of plenty (created by the steady growth of governments creating a ready supply of new upper-middle class slots independent of merit) politics prevailed.  So, Affirmative Action (AA) hires could be used as a means of political competition (status maintenance) by those at the top already.  That they were thereby closing off their own kids’s chances demonstrates their actual lack of merit: An easy-to-see-coming Tragedy of the Commons.*The unfortunate result of systematic AA is, of course, ever diminished competence at ever higher costs.  So putting a stop to that growth for any reason =&gt; consolidation with no clue as to how to deal with it.  No wonder the swamp hates and fears the Bad Orange Man.So, we should constantly push the message that we wish to restore the level playing field for our own kind so they can once again compete on merit.________________________* Every termite thinks that their little bite won’t effect the ever-hollowing tree.  Until the big wind comes.  Then the tree brakes apart and the crows eat all the termites the next morning.

        The consolidation you speak of results in increased inequality. We are familiar with the gap in wealth which grew between the top and the middle from 1980 onwards, but as consolidation accelerates to an extreme stage, the same economic inequality is becoming a feature WITHIN the top 10%. Nine of those ten are feeling their futures fade.The dream of internet wealth via “the killer app” is disappearing if not gone among the young. Today’s info and tech grads are discovering that their jobs are those of drones, not of world saviors who are “connecting people” and “serving all.” Likewise their incomes are insufficient to pay for the lives they expected in the over-priced hubs of the Creative Class, especially dragging the ball-and-chain of student debt around. (As Peter Schiff said long ago, “They have a mortgage, but no house.”)A primary reason for the super-Wokeness of this new urban precariat is that it is a public declaration that the $200,000-dollar-a-year programmer in SF or the $50,000-a-year gig-worker living with mom near Park Slope actually belongs in the elite.Consolidation leads to increased status anxiety. The competition is getting rougher as the number of spots to be occupied diminish. That makes some people try to one-up their friends with their radicalism — but it’s also an opportunity for conservative nationalists to start telling them a new story.Remember: no one is more open to new truths than the person who has just discovered that he has been lied to by the people he trusted.

            Peter Turchin in his latest book Ages of Discord argues that every 50 years there is a cycle of political instability, starting off with oversupply of labor, leading to falling wages and increasing economic inequality with a growing elite and a resentful working class.Eventually this leads to intense ultra-elite competition with too many people earning degrees, feeling they are entitled to rule but finding shrinking opportunities, fueling intra-elite resentment as well. Making matters worse is when there is governmental fiscal instability and a loss of faith in public institutions. Turchin believes we are close to point  for this powder keg to explode next decade.

        Consolidated culture is also a horror.  The biggest lines I’ve yet seen in Europe are at the St. Petersburg McDonald’s.  Strolled on by for the local market.  Like Scandinavia’s pestilent Amer-Irish “pubs,” strip-mall kitcsch and fast-goy-food are invasive cultural species that are choking off the diversity we should really be celerating – the unique fruits of cultures with strong cores and strong fences.At least 50+ lbs. overweight fatties are still thin on the ground here – almost unwitnessed in Scandinavia, somewhat “thicker on the ground” so far here in Mama Russia, where healthy habits are a less-popular import than KFC and Coca-Cola.  Food is still plentiful and cheap, albeit lower average quality than Norway or Denmark.  The beauties here are spectacular, equivalent to most winsome Vikings-dottirs I saw, but the left side of the Bell Curve look more like pasty Squatamalans.  Haven’t seen many apochrypal piss-drunk vodka casualties either.The Ice People are looking pretty solid, all told.

        Scale, scale, a thousand times scale.  In any human endeavor, bigger is worse.Yes, NAxALT, but this is a pretty sturdy heuristic.The Outsider Smart Fraction has been the mother of revolutions since revolution was invented.  This is why Machiavelli cautioned his Prince to allow subordinates their “liberties,” by which he meant their ambitions and petty fiefdoms, not anything Ben Shapiro is lighting a candle for this season.Keeping the talented tenth inside the Inner Party has historically been the best way to stay on top of rebels deprived of inspired and competent leadership.  If Cataline or Spartacus had been Caesar, if Wat Tyler had been Oliver Cromwell, or vice versa, if George Washington had been George McClellan, things would have turned out differently for those revolutions.A bloated, over-scaled Inner Party can and will dig itself such a deep moat that it leaves too many ambitious and talented leaders outside the winners’ circle.Guys like us.Likewise, overswelled, uncirculated and unculled elites will inevitably descend into contemptible attitudes and behaviors toward the citizenry.  There’s a famous tale of a Greek colony established by men who fled their home polis because the aristocrats had taken to beating the plebs with clubs for sport rather than civic order.Same as it ever was.  Science is showing the technical underpinnings of these ancient truths.  Scaled up, layered-up and lawyered-up societies can flaunt the Dunbar Number only so much for so long.  As the number of interpersonal contacts needed to navigate your holiday season grows from the moon-feast to the Saturnalia to today’s Black Friday, your fellow citizens become less and less human to you.Balkanization may have its downsides, but shrinking our societies is the only road back to sanity and sustainability.  Time to circulate, time to cull, and time to bridge the moats that keep so many of us on the favela periphery, deprived of our birthrights and the real, vital Will to Power liberties Machiavelli and Nietzsche wisely respected above the candy-coated catabolisis of the Enlightenment version.

        What I have learned through my reading of dissident thought is that Capitalism is really just a game. That is it’s problem is that games can be won. Even worse Capitalism seems I lead to a system where the winners of the game get to make the rules for all future variations of the game.What I think is interesting, especially as it relates to Libertarian thought, is that in order to be a viable long term system Capitalism needs an activist government to manage it. Left to its own devices it seems to go to the place described in this article.

            What’s the saying…”unbridled capitalism will soon be selling human flesh in the meat market.”  That I tend to agree with.Rules need to be established and enforced.  We don’t have a problem with capitalism, we have a problem with rules and enforcement.  Capitalists have been rent seeking from our political class since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, hence Marx.  The trick has always been getting human greed/interest to work for both the individual and society.Communism offered the people equality and got generally equal poverty—ruling class aside.  After a rough start—when rules were being developed and set—Capitalism created the greatest middle class the world has ever known in the USA.  In the last 50 years or so Capitalism left the bounds of the Nation State and went global—which has allowed our oligarch/capitalist cadre to “shit where they eat”—hollowing out our once touted middle class.This needs to stop.  But how?  That is the great challenge of the times.

                It is simply the problem of mean regression of available returns in any mature market.  So the only means of beating that is rent seeking, now through lobbying for regulation and tax code breaks.  Peter Thiel is one of the few that lays this out with no sanctimonious bullshit.  You want high returns? Have to create something that is effectively a monopoly for as long as you can sustain it.  Then move on to something else.  But as Herbert Stein posited…”things that can’t go on forever, won’t”.  The reckoning always come.  The 2008 crisis was just a prelude.  The bankers managed to sacrifice a few and keep the monopoly, but at the cost of the central banks now effectively being out of ammo.

            It becomes the government through regulatory capture.
There are different flavors of libertarianism but the AnCaps have no answer except to say let people figure it out through free association. Which either eventually creates a new government or becomes endless low-level revolution.   Maybe other libertarians have something substantially different to say but I doubt it.

            I’ve always said that until the brown wave starts lapping up on the shores of upper-middle class whites, we won’t see much. But it’s starting. Their kids don’t have the same opportunities as they did. Asians and Indians are starting to move into their neighborhoods. H1-Bs are taking their jobs.
Upper-middle class whites are just starting to notice that their bubble world isn’t as safe as they thought.

                I thought about you, Citizen, when I read the Z-man’s post.  Things may start getting tense when upper middle class white Americans find themselves competing with, and often  losing to, clannish Indians and Chinese.
Another factor is automation.  A lot of law practice can now be handled by software.  Tax preparation software has cut into the need for accountants.  There are probably other examples.  That’s going to make things even tenser in the competition for the remaining upper-middle class jobs.

                    There’s a very different look on the faces of upper-middle class whites when an Indian or Muslim or Asian starts spouting off about white privilege, especially when those people live your suburb. They don’t buy it. They also start to notice that they’re getting ganged up on.
Before it was some black lady or maybe a rabbi. But now they’re lining up to tell you how much you suck. And the real kicker: These others don’t let white women off the hook. NWLs are the canary in the coalmine.

                Indians aren’t doing themselves any favours with their current behaviour either. For a long time in Canada, they were literally just white people with brown skin. Some people called them paki whatever but nobody really hated them, and they didn’t seem to hate us.In the past 5-10 years they have totally changed as their numbers have exploded. They are now rude, racist, and general assholes. They do bad jobs at work. They seem to hate everything, especially whites.  They fuck up companies. Their kids are criminals and drug dealers obsessed with rap music and black culture. They appear to be an ugly people, inside and out. This is huge for me because previously I really had no issue with most of them.

                    Medicine and surgery[1] training programs are now overwhelmingly Indian or Pakistani. I know I’ve gone on about this before, but do a search on “internal medicine residency program” (or general surgery residency program”) and the name of your local teaching hospital. Not going to comment otherwise, but American (and probably Canadian) society has outsourced its next generation of physicians to the subcontinent. And I don’t so much mean people of Indian or Pakistani ancestry, I mean graduates of medical schools in the subcontinent, who then come here for post-MD (post-MBBS) residency training.Funny thing is, I have begun hearing (and hearing of) Indian and Pakistani MDs currently established in the US complaining about “too much immigration”.[1] Medicine (meaning the broad specialty of Internal Medicine) and Surgery are like Army and Marines. To the lay person we’re all just “doctors” — but to those in the field, NOT the same.

They want to live in a white society, which is why they came here. They don’t want to live with the people they ran away from.

                Agree. For decades, upper-middle class whites have been so distracted in their intense competition with one another that they failed to notice or take seriously economic threats from other cohesive ethnic groups.

        The Romans had a similar stability problem when the number of elites wanting billets in their Cursus Honorum far exceeded the supply. Many billets like provincial governorships were opportunities for personal enrichment. Only a few men can feast at the trough and everyone else gets crumbs, along with the burning humiliation of the associated lack of social status.

        Great post Mr. Z.  I am reminded of Peter Turchin’s observation of “elite overproduction”. As Horace pointed out, in Ancient Rome there were too many qualified people seeking too few public posts. Cassius and Brutus found plenty of supporters.  In the end, Octavius Caesar came out on top after a lot of the excess “elite” were put in their graves

            Tocqueville–Almost all the democratic movements that have troubled the world have been led by the nobility. An elite body can never satisfy the ambitions of all its members; there are always more talents and passions than tasks to deploy and there are bound to be a great number of men who, being unable to rise quickly enough by exploiting the privileges of the group, seek fast promotion by attacking these very privileges.

            I often ask myself if I’ve really taken the harder path or if I’ve been lazy about doing my own thing. The more I push against boomers, the less formidable they seem.  It’ doesn’t sit right to compete with your own in a zero-sum way, but that’s how it often seems they want it.

            This is wishful thinking.  When the Boomers are gone, things are going to be even worse.  Gen-X, in many ways is worse than boomers.  Our views on race are much less realistic than most Boomers. It’s going to be about 60 million fewer white people in the US when the last of the Boomers die.

        Consolidation isn’t the only mega-trend that is changing next-gen society fundamentally. Young men are increasingly turning to video gaming as a distraction from boredom and lethargy, and the concomitant physical idleness is producing zombified couch potatoes in huge numbers. How long before the majority of our society becomes fat jellyfish? Will the next revolution be fought by dysfunctional transgenders flinging couch pillows? It’s time to turn those vacant retail shops into neighborhood fight club arenas and get the testosterone flowing again.

        I don’t see the smartest people being in Dissident politics. Most are still seeking the status of the system. However, Z is partially right in that the number of smart people on our side of the divide is growing and will likely grow exponentially more as Gen Z gets driven out of the elite ranks and middle class. Gen Z males will be really hurt by their replacements (both American born and first generation immigrants) and the  anti white jihad

            Not sure I’m the sharpest knife in the drawer, or even that such is necessary, for a successful participant in the DR movement,  but I am fairly convinced that the depth, breath, and experience of the commentators on this blog are pretty unique.  Disagree we may, but it would seem to me that a formidable force, grounded in reason, logic, and science is growing here—albeit currently small.  That ain’t going away folks.

        Amazon today is the Sears of yesteryear, and but for a bit of innovation in the 90s Sears of yesteryear could still be something today.  Put the catalog online instead of discontinue it, and it would have been magic.
Amazon is catalog shopping writ large, and the same way Sears anchored shopping malls full of smaller retailers Amazon fulfillment is bring smaller sellers across the internet into people’s homes.  Watch the parallels of Amazon’s impact on smaller retailers compared to the impact of the Sears catalog a century ago.

        Z-man, I either strongly agree with your post today or strongly disagree. It all depends on what you mean by “capitalism”.I hope that we can all agree that the USA does NOT have a free market laissez-faire economic system and has not had anything close to that since the war of northern aggression at least. Many doubt we ever practiced pure laissez faire other than perhaps in the old west where there was no real State to intervene.If we call our present system “capitalism,” which is OK with me, then we have to say that “capitalism” is really economic fascism. I do not mean this in a pejorative manner. I mean it in the technical sense of fascism being the merger of the State and Big Business.In so many ways, the mega corp benefits from the rules, regulations, laws, interference, and so forth of the ultra powerful State. Little outfits often can’t even meet the regulatory burden to get in the game. Likewise the State benefits from the huge mega corporations. The State and the Corporation are two partners in a diabolical power game. (and they are winning biggly)At some time or the other, the dissident right needs to offer Mr. and Mrs. Normie a vision of the future that we can achieve by moving from where we are now to the system we propose. Surely to God in Heaven we don’t propose just electing “better people”.PS: On the other hand, this being the Christmas season and all, I am not sure we can win. Christ will win in the end, but much suffering will happen before the final battle. Perhaps the Christian USA is a thing of the past and we will only see tyranny and madness. Sure looks like that from here.

            Mark – Defining fascism as a merger of Big Biz and the State is a (((trick))) vulture-capital shills like D’Souza and Shapiro use to make guys like Mitt Romney angels while demonizing any world-view that subordinates Mammon as “collectivist.”  This was the classical lolbertarian-Objectivist formulation of angels and devils, the individualists vs. collectivists, with the angels practicing their faith in the Holy Market.In terms of economics, fascism varied depending on time and place but generally it just meant subordinating industry to public interest.  It set the boundaries for business liberties, e.g. no porn, no trading with enemies, and in wartime, nationalizing production for national defense.  What AEI hucksters present as fascism is really just corruption, the same kind of thing you see with rent-seeking crony capitalism today.Yes, the Italian and German governments had corrupt officials, as did Salazar’s and Franco’s, but this is the result of corruption, not fascism.  No system is safe from this, and capitalism by elevating self-dealing to an axiomatic good and end in itself is arguably even more prone to this.  As least the other systems nominally demonize self-dealing.  Capitalism celebrates it.Markets are a universal feature of all societies, not a unique capitalist invention.  Kept in their proper scale and context, markets are a net-positive.  The communist ideal of state rationing for all things is simply unworkable and Hayek did have a point with his Knowledge Problem.  That said, the fascists had a point with allowing the state to call BS on the markets when the public interest called for it.  We can legitimately argue over how that interest is defined and exercised, but it’s increasingly hard to defend the capitalist system’s overt elevation of economic interests over the broader public interest.  Contra Hayek’s broader philosophy and modern conservo-libertarianism in general, unfettered capitalism does not produce the greatest good for the greatest number by some inherent “invisible hand” mechanism.

                Sorry to take so long to reply, you probable won’t even see this.
My question is: what do you want to call the present system if it is not fascism? The Federal, state, and local governments are closely involved in all aspects of business and commerce. It is not “capitalism” and you say it is not ‘fascism”. OK Then. What will we call it?

        The Phd. glut in a number of fields has been an issue for a long time now even in STEM fields. There too many of these people relative to the number of public and private sector jobs available. I have an acquaintance that chairs a public university engineering department. When a faculty position is posted, he easily receives up to 4 or five dozen resumes for an opening. And from really good schools to. Why is money wasted over educating people for jobs that don’t exist?

        Notice the consolidation in thought also.  All the leading thought managers in media, the university and Hollywood use coercion, social pressure, and ostracism to enforce uniformity in thought.

It would enable the Elite’s children to loiter around – at OUR expense – fomenting trouble.Better that the Elite pay for their own kids to lounge around in the basement. After a short time, the embarrassment of having to admit that their Precious is still unemployed should drive them to either hire them in their OWN company, or have them pressure the kid to take a “lesser” job.

        Up the Revolution.
But the lawyers and professors ride the tumbrils anyway.   They did harm, they crowed about it, let the crows eat them.
Happy New Year

        But, the story of the last 200 years and its Great Enrichment is that successive economic and technological revolutions have knocked the economic top dogs out of their comfy niche, but that overall, humans did better.
Maybe this time is different.
But if things are getting tricky for the education “gentry” then the lefty hysteria makes sense.

            We’ve done so much better that we’re refusing to breed, overdosing on opiates and making a blood-guilt sacrifice of our patrimony to Team Brown.f this is better, we could stand to do worse.As for knocking the economic top dogs out of their niches, (((some people))) seem to hang on despite all this “creative destruction,” along with goyim vulture capitalists like the Rockefellers and other century-plus robber baron dynasts.Material prosperity isn’t everything.  How much of the “Great Enrichment” has really enhanced human happiness in the sense Pat Buchanan and Tucker Carlson have described it rather than in bugman-GDP metric terms?In cultural and human terms, we’ve generated a lot of heat but not a lot of light in this great burst of productivity.  We’ve moved far and wide, but in every direction but forward for the most part.

        Gee, the consolidation of the brewing industry didn’t seem to work out so well. From three or four major breweries the country went to thousands of brew pubs and the revival of regional brews. Star brand Budweiser was sold to foreigners that would probably like their money back. There were once three real auto manufacturers in the US and from time to time some minor thing like Hudson or American Motors. Now there’s no end to the marques available, both domestic and foreign.
The fact is that success inspires imitation, innovation and competition.

            Craft beer is 13% of beer sales. Much of what qualifies as craft beer is actually brewed by the big brewers under contract. Here in Lagos, there is now one beer distributor that controls something like 90% of the beer sold through stores. The same is true for other food products. Ice cream, for example, in this area is sold by two distributors, each with a monopoly on certain lines.

                Constellation bought Ballast Point for big bucks because craft brew was going to be the next big thing.  They just sold it out to someone small for (an undisclosed) pennies on the dollar because consolidation and scale in craft brewing is a mirage.  We are the craft brewers of politics and culture.  Scaling up is hard, but building communities and associating with allied communities appears the way forward.  Craft cultural brew is not likely a path to riches and fame, but it might lead to a really good set of choices for the consumers of such things to pick from the shelf.

            Said a guy typing this lolbertarian laughing gas on a Windows or Mac computer plugged into a Cisco worldwide backbone eating food he bought from one of five major grocery chains with money from a half-dozen national banks, echoing the neo-liberal agit-prop he heard from one of the media outlets owned by six companies in America.
But at least I still have muh craft beer &amp; muh Gubmint Motors-financed crap-wagon.

                Perhaps not the best example, but I believe in all states that have legal recreational or medical marijuana, it is produced in state, and therefore arguably a local industry.  California pot is reportedly so good that they ar even smuggling it into Mexico!
