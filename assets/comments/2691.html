        I’ve just read Levenson’s email, the one people are claiming is racist. As I suspected earlier, it’s all about the Benjamins.  In the email Levenson just laid out the B&amp;W facts about the demographics of Atlanta and the Hawks fan base.  Atlanta is a Chocolate City.  The Hawks’ fans are overwhelmingly black. (Heck, basketball is a black sport.  The NBA is a black league.)  If anyone could be offended over what he wrote, it would be the southern whites he theorized were too “uncomfortable” being the minority in a black majority crowd at the arena to buy season tickets or to attend Hawks’ games. If the race hustler Jesse Jackson had written the same email to urge affirmative action to increase the diversity of the fan base, with the words “white” and “black” switched, people would be falling over themselves to show their approval.  Instead, in a city where blacks outnumber whites 2:1, a discussion of any effort to draw more fans from the affluent white minority is being labelled “racist.”  Yep, it’s all about the money.  I say Levenson is getting out at the right time.  Shrewd move.

        Best to shut down the league for a few months and send everyone out for a mandatory diversity training course.

        Levenson is getting out while the getting out is good. This probably has less to do with race than with money.  With the Clippers being sold for an unprecedented price to an overly rich guy who didn’t know what the f**k to do with his immense fortune, maybe Levenson thought now was the time to get a good price for the Hawks before the sports market crashed. Being run out of the League?  Naaah.  That’s just the  pretense to cash in.

        The urge to self-mortification is so deep that some persons confess in the absence of any threat.
I must be a psychopath. I just say “f… ’em.”

        A self-reporting Jew, eh? Maybe this is the next thing. An NBA owner schul with Rabbi Silver presiding. Well, Sterling did indicate that the entire congregation was guilty.

        It’s ironic that the American street game where kids can soar out of Cabrini-Green and Bed-Stuy on the strength of mental toughness and suburb athleticism is being squeezed to death by a bunch of spineless little pussies.
