        A rough rule of thumb I use to decide whether some tune has any worth is to ask myself if people are going to be playing it on a jukebox in a bar fifty years from now.
For ‚Äúplaying it on a jukebox in a bar‚Äù, those of you of not so old, substitute ‚Äòhaving it played in a public space where a bunch of you are gathered, with the expectation that most will tolerate it without raising a fuss.‚Äô
Blacks in their eighties listening to ‚ÄúFuck Tha Police‚Äù is going to be hilarious.

        It seems to me that most of the 20th century was a process of losing our musical vocabulary. Rock lost the harmonic and rhythmic sophistication of jazz, rock is generally played with mostly power chords backing repetitive song structures. Rap in turn lost rock‚Äôs melodic sensibilities and lyrical intelligence. We are now reduced to drumming and chanting. Even at that, it‚Äôs frequently a machine doing the drumming and chanting. I‚Äôm curious as to how much more can be removed and still be anything that could reasonably be called music.

        They‚Äôve even sanitized the past in a lot of cases.  For instance, whenever I introduce a class to cultural criticism, I ask them to guess what the number 1 song was in 1969, the very year of Woodstock, the Days of Rage, etc..  I get a lot of guesses about the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, etc., all of which had huge hits that year, BUT ‚Äî the #1 overall best seller was ‚ÄúSugar Sugar,‚Äù by the Archies.  Tom Jones was in the top 10, and Harry Mancini‚Äôs Orchestra was in the top 20.  That‚Äôs real diversity, but nobody knows‚Ä¶

            For many years of my childhood ‚Äúpopular music‚Äù still included Hee Haw, Lawrence Welk, and the Boston Pops. I suppose the audience big enough to justify those broadcasts eventually died off. In a sense ‚Äúeverything‚Äù is on tap via YouTube and Spotify, but there was something about broadcast shows that put the spotlight on things and allowed the larger culture to share them. Now everyone can be an expert in obscure stuff, but it‚Äôs hard to share passions for obscurities. Another example of the atomization of modern society

                Yes, it‚Äôs always important to remember that one of the most popular groups of the late 1960‚Äôs was Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass. As Severian noted, this has all been airbrushed away by our cultural Commissars.‚ÄúThe West does not have a competitor that embraces freedom and liberty, so the past has become the competition.‚ÄùVery true. The past has become to our modern managerial state what the US was to the USSR during the Cold War; and our modern totalitarians hate and fear it for the same reason, and respond in the same way ‚Äì jamming, censorship, social opprobrium. Our overlords fear the past like they fear nothing else, except possibly Christianity ‚Äì and of course, the two fears are very closely intertwined. This is like the death wish that infects so much of our society ‚Äì once you start looking for it, you see it everywhere.

            Most young people know nothing about anything older than Madonna and Brittany‚Äôs open-mouth stage kiss ‚Äî and even that‚Äôs receding into the gray past.  I lead (past tense) many soldiers ‚Äî from new recruits to older NCOs, and newly minted lieutenants to mid-field-grade officers.  Even in that crowd, they had no idea of who we were as a people, and what we had done, in or out of uniform.In that particular field, associated with their own, they had no idea about the great bomber war in Europe ‚Äî the numbers and human cost ‚Äî even with participants still this side of the turf.  Over 600 aircraft launched in two missions to Schweinfurt-Regensburg alone ‚Ä¶ with 60 lost each mission.  Six hundred men.  Those I know yet alive who flew these missions still awaken at night from terrible dreams.Nor did they know anything of the unfathomably difficult B-29 flights undertaken from Guam, Saipan and Tinian to Japan, and back.  1,500 miles each way, or, as one old participant told me: ‚ÄúNine hours up, and nine back.‚Äù  Nothing; nada.Or how about the wonders we created, like radio, and the supporting technology ‚Ä¶ at thing that gripped our nation for decades.  Or the automobile, and on and on.All of this gone under an impenetrable wailing about pollution, exploitation, sexism and racism.  They are taught nothing; they know nothing (as a whole), yet they are primed for activism, social action, and to ‚Äúmake a difference.‚Äù  Savages.

            Music is just like movies, magazines, and books.  Much of what was popular has been airbrushed away.  Go through the top tens of all of these things in times past, and a few things jump out at you.  Many are unfamiliar now, much of it is dreck, but it is dreck that was part of the cultural landscape of the day.  Many people delude themselves about the present, and also about the past.Here‚Äôs a hint.  The past was mostly about the white middle class interests, fears, and experience.  Airbrushing it away helps hide how warped our current culture actually is.

                Funny thing is, just a year earlier ‚ÄúHarper Valley PTA‚Äù was a massive hit ‚Äî Jeannie C. Riley was, sez Wiki, the first woman to top the Billboard Hot 100andthe country charts.  It sold 6 million singles, and it was about a single mom and her daringly high hemline.  It doesn‚Äôt sound like a ‚ÄúSixties‚Äù song, but you‚Äôd thing such a Grrrrl Power! anthem would be fondly remembered today‚Ä¶.

                    Even past versions of liberalism are a threat to the modern version. Carl Marx is now just another dead white male, and those ‚Äúdaringly high hemlines‚Äù that were all the rage among lefty chicks in the ‚Äô60‚Äôs are now ‚Äúsigns of sexual objectification and submission to the male gaze‚Äù or some such BS. That‚Äôs just it; you can‚Äôt just be on the left, anymore ‚Äì you have to keep moving left, ever farther and ever faster. ‚ÄúRed Queen Syndrome‚Äù indeed.

        Art, and pop music, like advertising we see now on cable channels, and predominately in the shows themselves, is now about power.  That end, of course, is a major concern of politics ‚Äî along with money, position, and ‚Ä¶. passion.  Art is now both a parent and the child of politics.  Power is the brass ring for which they reach.  So of course Art ‚Äî pop music / movies / painting / literature et al ‚Äî becomes flat, utilitarian, and somehow false (though visually stimulating).  Those seeking power have bent all to their use, and coopted those delusional souls who are artistically inclined.I come from a family of artists, and have seen the delusion, political madness, hate and destruction that follows the fusing of art and politics.Looking back as a high-year boomer, it‚Äôs easy to see, for example, that John Lenon certainly was about politics, along with countless other musical artists, such as Madonna, to name just one of these later ‚Ä¶ performers.  (NOTE: I followed none of them, and was not a ‚Äúfan.‚Äù  Even as an early teen, I was put off by late 60s-early-70s popular culture.)  From my aging vantage point, I can see this channeling of music into politics and power came in order behind the written word, and film, this latter being largely consumed with those things from it‚Äôs earliest times, when directors, producers, actors and writers discovered the power that story and iimages exerted over great swaths of humanity.  But they all become political tools, if not created initially to that end.Art now provides the creative engine driving the ideology of post-modernism, or leftism, or whatever we want to call it.  It is used now to supply a continuing source of imagery, of grist, to fill the minds of a population that must be manipulated to the ends of those who would shape our reality, and control our lives ‚Ä¶. entirely.

            The same thing has spilled over into any exercise that offers opportunities for creativity.  Think of architecture, housing, transportation, computers, phones, and so on.  They all socialize us to accept what we are given, and to not criticize anything.  Brutalist architecture, and its style allies in the West, are the most egregious examples, IMHO.

        I don‚Äôt even know how to explain the excitement of a rock concert in the 80‚Äôs to my son.  I showed him the Metallica ‚Äô89 concert as much to see the crowd as to hear the band.
And you‚Äôre right about the loyalty.  I was watching the concert video of one of Rush‚Äôs last tours.  It was like a religious revival for middle-agers.
Much of what I hear from today‚Äôs music sounds like a black guy reading a Dr. Seuss book.

            It is a strange thing. In my youth, punks had their music. Metal heads had their music. The future libertarians listened to the Dead. Music reflected the groupings among white teens. That seems to have started to collapse in the 90‚Äôs and now it no longer applies.

                The US was increasingly diverse in the 90‚Äôs and as the decades went on people spent less and less time with other people.Once the Internet was everywhere (mid  noughties  or so) the public culture has started to collapse.On the positive  side of things the Internet made music available to all even earlier. Back in the late 90‚Äôs early 2000‚Äôs it took a while to download  (a few minutes) there was a ton of music . I used to haunt MP3.com before the record labels got them shut down and found out about tons of new music there.Once you are off the industry plantation, no need to go back and with such a large variety the commonality of limits is gone.Big cities where the subculture formed to a high degree are also heavily foreign which has an impact too, most US metal-heads , shitkickers and punks were  American White . Less  of those guys less of the related subcultures .Non White subcultures, mostly Latino have different music tastes, around here rap and Spanish language music

            Rock is basically updated vaudeville. You get the same thing from a Stones concert you get from a minstrel show. Mick Jagger gives you a song, a dance and a few jokes, engages in silly call and response dialogues with the audience, etc. All that‚Äôs missing is the blackface. Throw that in, and it‚Äôd almost be indistinguishable from Al Jolson, except louder.

                    Ha! Yeah, Cab Calloway is great! When I see films of him from the 30s he looks like a prototype of Prince, with the long hair and the leaping about. There‚Äôs an old film of him doing Refer Man that‚Äôs really a treat. I don‚Äôt have a link handy, but if you can track it down you‚Äôll see what I mean about the resemblance.

                        Cab Callaway attended our suburban NYC Episcopal church.  He was very dignified, always in a suit, which is what all the men wore to church in the 50s and 60s, with white shirts and neckties; the ladies in dresses and hats.  I remember Mrs. Callaway as being from Jamaica (not Queens, NY) and having mocha colored skin and auburn hair.  Their oldest daughter was Chris Callaway.  She was a stunner.  Very unusual looking with large, very dark eyes, oval face and slightly freckled mocha colored skin.  Her reddish hair was short and curled close to her head.  We were in the same Confirmation class.  She married trumpeter Hugh Masekela later.  I‚Äôve always wondered why the Callaways chose to drive at least 20 miles to attend this particular church as back then there were lots of Episcopal churches around in that area.

            Very true.  But Black music went down the blind alleyway of Rap, and it just can‚Äôt seem to gets itself out. Even if you like Rap, as a genre, it‚Äôs over forty years old, and any genre will pretty much be mined out in that length of time. As to why this is, I have no idea, but it certainly hasn‚Äôt helped the American music scene.

                One of my mom‚Äôs favorite records was Ray Charles‚Äô two country albums (mostly Hank Williams songs). I think the problem these days is no melody. People want to be able to SING a song. You can‚Äôt do that with most of the current music. And I still don‚Äôt understand why rap is popular, other than you don‚Äôt need much talent to do it.
They have done all they can to drain our society of beauty.

        ‚ÄúJustin Timberlake may be very talented as a singer, but no one is confusing him with Frank Sinatra.‚ÄùBut, Justin Timberlake is not really a singer, is he? He is really a song-and-dance-man. We can thank MTV for the reemergence of the S &amp; D man. Once music started being marketed with the visual overwhelming the auditory component, the equation changed. Young people needed something to watch in tandem with what they were hearing. Sure, music has always had a visual component. Concerts. Night Clubs. TV shows. The Beatles even had ‚Äúmusic videos‚Äù like Hard Day‚Äôs Night or stylistic interpretations of Strawberry Fields Forever and Penny Lane. But MTV changed music from what you heard to what you saw.  This led to the Michael Jackson phenomenon. He was Sammy Davis, Jr, for a new generation. After Jackson, if you couldn‚Äôt shuck and jive you wouldn‚Äôt be found entertaining by large numbers of children.I think the generational component of music is fascinating. I can listen to Beethoven, Bach, and Mozart and be in awe of their genius. But, I can listen to Big Band music, the music of my parents, and music from the 60‚Äôs and early 70‚Äôs and find the genius of the composers and musicians. My personnel generation was the 60‚Äôs and early 70‚Äôs and I am amazed at the quantity of great music from that period of about 10 years. But, why just 10 years? I have concluded that it is because of the worldwide over-exposure of the music of this period, the imitation of and competition between artists, and the disposable income of the youth, something that never really drove commercial music. I also believe that music is a young man‚Äôs game. How long did the Beatles really create great songs? How long was Paul Simon a good tunesmith? Sure, they might pop out a popular song after their heyday, but it only showed the contrast with how great they had been ‚Äúin the past‚Äù.Why do I prefer the music of the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs? Possibly because that was just before and after puberty. When you are young, every experience is more intense than when you are older. I attribute this to the fact it is new to you personally and your neurotransmitters and hormones act to make new experiences create new pathways in your brain. But this doesn‚Äôt explain why I don‚Äôt care as much for the music of the 50‚Äôs. I heard that at the same time I heard the music of the 60‚Äôs and I found the earlier music to be more primitive. Partially because it was, partially because electronics and recording techniques had not reached the level they had a decade later. That explains it to me, but why were the musicians that came after the 50‚Äôs more creative than the Elvis‚Äôs and Chuck Berry‚Äôs? Why did the thinner, less sophisticated sound of 50‚Äôs popular music appeal to the Beatles, Stones, and others, and become the inspiration for what they did? Again, the generational component of coming of age with something ‚Äúnew‚Äù. Music of the 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs? Sound-of-a-raspberry. Sure, you had an occasional bright light, but overall I find hair bands and rap to be low forms of music. Their enthusiasts do not.I would love to see scientific treatises on age related susceptibility to art. I think it is very important, actually. If you have noticed, since at least the late 80‚Äôs, rap became ubiquitous in movies, TV and the airwaves. I think the process has dissipated somewhat. But, what is the psychological result of exposing young impressionable minds to such a pathetic excuse for art and forcing an entire generation to consider it ‚Äútheir music‚Äù? We know that dumbing down education is a fact and see the results everyday. What effect does dumbing down your exposure to art have on your soul?

        The reason the magic beans quit working is because muzak in the 90 s sucked the hind shit tit.  (Did gramps use that one?)I mark the end officially as Yo! MTV raps.  Once things became a black thing that I didn‚Äôt understand, because I was not OG like Mr Robbie VanWinkle, I  sort of retreated into my cassette collection.  Nirvana worked for about a year, but Seattle sound was just a bunch of unwashed dope fiends preaching about ThaPooor.the whole social justice message thing is the greatest culprit.  Even Dave Mustaine got all weird and anti nuke. Another refuge lost.I can‚Äôt even enjoy Kill The Poor by the dead Kennedy‚Äôs now thanks to the Damn progressives.  Before I thought it was funny, now I see hidden messages and control levers in everything.

            It used to be the clubs were the proving ground. You started at the fifth warm-up act, learning how to play live and develop your own sound. A guy I went to prep school with got a job while in high school as a scout. Even though he was underage, he could get into clubs and listen to acts. He‚Äôd write up a report and send it to his boss. After school, he worked full time as a talent scout. About 20 years ago he changed careers as there was no real need for his talent. Pop music is produced like all other pop culture. Even hip-hop is a system now.

            Yes, a lot of the stuff I dismissed as tripe back in the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs sounds pretty good now. And some of the stuff that was supposed to be risque back in the 60‚Äôs, like Mick Jagger‚Äôs song ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Spend the Night Together‚Äù sounds almost quaintly romantic these days.

        The incubator of genius is provincialism, always has been. Art, literature, music, even politics. Universalism suffocates genius.A few decades of European Union will undo ten centuries of advance.The great majority of Aferican genius happened under the watch of segregation. Great Jewish musicians were usually raised in ghettos. What did Paganini experience as a child in 18th century Genoa other than what Genoa offered? On and on.The great political thinkers of our day are waaaay off the reservation.

        I would like to recommend the biography of Soviet composer Dmitri Shostakovich titled ‚ÄúTestimony‚Äù by Solomon Volkov. It came out in the West while the Iron Curtain was still intact and there was debate on this side about its validity.https://www.amazon.com/Testimony-Memoirs-Shostakovich-Solomon-Volkov/dp/087910998XShostakovich worked in the circles of the Soviet elite in St. Petersburg, was close friends with Marshall Zhukov and even had a personal encounter with the mustachioed tyrant himself. Stalin, who fancied himself a music critic wrote a critique of Shostakovich‚Äôs opera Lady Macbeth of Mtensk that was devistating. He thought surely he was destined for the Gulag. The book draws a clear picture of what is was like for an artist of extreme genius to work under communist totalitarianism. It also gives one a rounded picture of life in Leningrad before, during and after WWII.

            I highly, highly recommend a book by Nigel Cliff called ‚ÄúMoscow Nights‚Äù. Van Cliburn, a masterful classical pianist from a small Texas town, travels to Moscow during the height of the Cold War and wins a Soviet sponsored international piano competition and becomes a national idol ‚Äì in Soviet Russia. It‚Äôs not just about a classical piano player, it has a lot of Cold War history during the period of time when nuclear war seemed inevitable. Shostakovich plays a minor role in the book also, being one of the judges of the Tchaikovsky Piano Competition. A very good read.

            Big music  is an artifact of the  mass culture of the industrial age. I‚Äôm rather glad its dying though and a far more diverse, individual music scene will be better, IMO
Lower barriers of entry is rarely a bad thing
This doesn‚Äôt mean the music of the past was bad, not at all but that does mean a bigger idea space, actual diversity in its positive meaning  and a lot more opportunities to avoid  Entartete Kunst or enjoy it if that is what you are into

            Wheedle;Those drawings are absolutely but not surprisingly shocking in their depiction of the human depravity of Russian Communism.Having also watched the Jordan Peterson video, I am stunned and saddened that he resolutely refuses to connect  cause to effect.  Namely that rejection of God can lead to this sort of depravity by small steps.  To begin with, he hides the fact that Alexander Solzhenitsyn became a Christian in the camps and attributed his survival to that.Apparently Peterson is all about Existentialism.  While this is better than the Nihilism he rightly excoriates, for most people it‚Äôs a thin reed to lean on that pierces the hand.  IOW, It‚Äôs just like Libertarianism:  It‚Äôs of comfort to the top 1%, period.  And it‚Äôs of no practical use or comfort to anybody else.In the analogue ancient form of Stoicism, it was the preferred philosophy of later Roman Emperors and Senators, etc.  But pretty thin gruel otherwise.  The Goths thought otherwise.

                Al from da Nort,I believe history repeats itself. Politics inevitably lead to death. You are left with choosing a side that tells you to fight for your side.https://www.redstate.com/diary/reddog53/2010/05/15/politics-is-war-by-other-means/We all have our own version of Utopia. And we like to think that our government will give us the freedom to do what we want to do. Even communist China has learned to use capitalism to provide their citizens with a sense of freedom. I‚Äôm told Marlboro is a popular product for sale.Another point to consider is brought up by Joseph A Tainter in his book ‚ÄúCollapse of Complex Societies‚Äù. Energy is what maintains a society and even allows it to grow. The Roman Empire thrived on the conquest of other nations, and confiscating their resources. When there were no more nations to conquer, their complex society went into decline.https://www.google.com/search?q=collapse+of+complex+sdcieties+joseph+taintor&amp;oq=collapse+of+complex+sdcieties+joseph+taintor&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.30429j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8It‚Äôs good to have a conversation with like minded people. Alas, will the youth see the coming of a One World Government as a blessing or a curse? The Russian Gulags were a form of population control, similar to birth control and war. When the planets resources reach depletion levels, decline is a catalyst for all sorts of blame. Choose a side that‚Äôs sustainable.https://www.peakprosperity.com/video/85850/playlist/92161/crash-course-chapter-15-demographicsGood Luck to everyone, and smell the roses along the wayüôÇ

        I‚Äôve been enjoying the comments on this throughout the day. One other thing I think of is that Quincy Jones interview everyone made fun for a few weeks ago did have some smart elements among the craziness. At one point he laments that younger musicians don‚Äôt actually study music anymore. Lots of that ‚Äúcorny‚Äù stuff from the old days people have been talking about here‚ÄìMancini, Herb Alpert, Sinatra, the Beach Boys‚Äìhad lots of craftsmanship to it. There were smart people who knew about arranging and harmony behind this stuff. Today so much stuff is literally ‚Äúwritten‚Äù on a computer. They have programs where you can just blop in sampled elements, repeat them, etc. and you‚Äôve got a dance track. They literally refer to this as ‚Äúpiano roll‚Äù style programs, because the elements are just rectangles on the screen. No need to read music anymore.

        American pop music of the 1950-70s was a tremendous force for U.S. soft power.  The songs reflected a human nature and a drive that was lacking from most non-British pop.  It was cool to listen to the American pop.  Foreigner educated here became strongly attached to the American music that was popular during there time here.  Having spent much of my career in E. Asia I can attest to this power.  What a terrible thing to piss this away.  As we can see among the newly arrived ‚Äúyouths‚Äù of Europe, anybody can do rap, it takes talent to make music.

        I listen to FM radio when I am driving around, but don‚Äôt listen to music much, otherwise.  The stations are all ads and happy talk now, and the DJs have quickly evolved from some old wizened guy leavened by a few younger people, to the sports and beer bro‚Äôs, to now a duo with a gal that has a voice like Kathy Griffin and a gay guy.As for the music, for me it has gotten to ‚Äúwhatever‚Äôs on, at least it is music (rap and the Beastie Boys are not music)‚Äù.  Even country has sold out.My Tijuana classical station (the only classical in San Diego) just closed shop, the slot going instead to these mariachi infused Mexican ballads and 60s style over-the-top love ballads.  Few ads, and the ads themselves are hilarious, often done up in the big voices and cheesy sound effects of those old 60s radio ads.  Strangely, I find myself on this station more than any of the others. More music, less other stuff, and some sort of banal honesty (it is what it is, and does not pretend otherwise).  I can work on my smattering of street spanish as well.The state of music and radio broadcasting must be pretty bad if a cheezy little Tijuana broadcast sounds better.

            That‚Äôs the reason I actually got Sirius renewed on my car.  I got the first 6 months free and realized that the same stations (NYC) were playing the same stuff over and over again.   The oldies station WCBS, which used to play 50s ‚Äì 80‚Äôs is now mostly 80‚Äôs and up with a smattering of 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs.  One classic rock station, but too many ads.The small fry stations that sound interesting for 5 minutes are of no use because after 5 minutes of driving the static noise overwhelms the speakers, the result of their low wattage transmitters and going out of range.On the AM dial,  its sports talk which I have grown tired of listening to all the armchair coaching and ridiculous hypothetical trades from callers and announcers alike.  Don‚Äôt like the news stations and there is one channel with the likes of Rush and Hannity,  I get tired of it after a while.So my Sirius got me hooked after 6 months,  I always thought I would never pay for it,  but to get more music, less chit-chat,  that was fine.  Plus on occassion,  I‚Äôll toss on Patriot radio to hear some new voices that I don‚Äôt hear on free AM.

        When I was in HS just about all of my money went to buying albums.  Now days I pay almost $0 for music; only buy stuff I hear on the local jazz station, that isn‚Äôt available online.   Have almost 2TB of music now, mostly jazz with a large amount of rock.  In my online journeys have encountered so much beautiful and unusual music.  An album of Byzantine music made with replica instruments from the era; Balinese temple chants, etc.  Have a decent system to play it on too.So I could give two shits about the current state of the music (or film) industry.   The history of music is at my fingertips ‚Äî even if the internet goes away.

        I don‚Äôt really know if this is quite accurate. The current pop music seems to be dominated by sub-moronic ghetto blacks and hispanics rapping about selling drugs, long as it has been, probably at least a decade now.The number 1 viewed music video on Youtube is Daddy Yankee‚Äôs Despacito at an absolutely mind-boggling 4.9 BILLION.Whip Whip/Nae Nae is basically this generation‚Äôs Kriss Kross one-hit-wonder song. 1.5 BILLION views.This poison has never been viewed by more people. Worrying about album sales and downloads and all that is a bit beyond the point. This is poison in the well, not so much money maximization.I‚Äôm right now, out of pure morbid curiosity, becoming the 1.5 billionthh person to listen to a clinically retarded black middle schooler exhort me to ‚Äúdo the stanky leg.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs comforting to think people are going to Youtube for Frank Sinatra but its a falsity. Nancy Sinatra‚Äôs These Boots Are Made for Walking is the top Sinatra song, at an absolutely pedestria 119 million.Its also quite striking how many of these songs are by Hispanics of difficult to ascertain vintage and not in English.

        Interesting post especially since I just subscribed to Sirius. The best 59 bucks I‚Äôve spent in a long time. Oldies, Sinatra, great American songbook, the whole shebang. My favorite is the Opera channel. What a rich, wonderful experience. I have the Opera on while watching MLB pre-season (muted). Given that most operas are about as long as a typical MLB game it‚Äôs a great fit. I wish all of us could rediscover the beauty created by our (European) ancestors. What a marvelous patrimony.

        I have Sirius XM in my car.  My playlist when I am alone covers 60‚Äôs-80‚Äôs with a mellow channel and channels called Classic Vinyl and Classic Rewind.  I have one playlist set up for my teen daughter with all the channels of new pop music from today.The other day,  I had on my USB plug-in (about 250 songs) when my daughter gets in the car after dance school.  The song that comes on is ‚ÄúMagic Carpet Ride‚Äù by Steppenwolf.   She sits down, we drive off and after about 30 seconds,  she is tapping her foot and bouncing her legs to the song.  When the song ends,  I throw on the Sirius back to her her channel playlist.  She tells me I can keep listening to my music, lol.   Hell she even liked that old bubblegum song by 1910 Fruitgum Factory ‚Äì Simon Says.   So yeah there‚Äôs some yearning out there for the classics!

        I owe you for introducing me to ‚ÄúTomorrow Belongs To Me‚Äù. Got a good laugh when I looked it up. The version you had at the end of last week‚Äôs podcast was good, too.I read an interview years ago with John Lydon, and he mentioned how important it is for musicians to have strong roots. Kind of ironic, given that the Sex Pistols were one of the most manufactured bands of all time, but the idea has some merit.I like EDM, but it‚Äôs always amusing to me that an atomized, deracinated people would end up listening to beep-boop music with the human element removed.

            Funny, but I thought about trying to figure out the number of three cord combinations that are possible and appealing. That would be the absolute ceiling for the number of possible pleasant songs. Then, narrow it down with four chord and five chord combinations.

        ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs another thing that may be plaguing pop culture in general and pop music in particular. When I was a teen, your music said something about you because you felt a connection to the band. In the sterile transactional world of today, no one feels an attachment to anything,  There‚Äôs no sense of obligation to buy or  listen to their latest release. Supporting a type of music or a specific act is no longer a part of kid‚Äôs identity. The relationship is now as sterile as society.‚ÄùThe same is true for sports. Why should I root for one professional sports team over another, other than that it‚Äôs fun to get together with friends and pretend to care?

        I was at a trivia event recently, and was amazed when the 20 somethings at my table knew the oldies better than me.  I spent a lot of time in Israel over the last decade, and all the bars are filled with young people listening to music from the 70-90s.  I always tell my kids that if you can‚Äôt identify at least 3 instruments, it‚Äôs not music.  They are teenagers and like a lot of the older pop/rock music.  Unfortunately, they also like a lot the the current jungle boogie, and I don‚Äôt mean Kool and the Gang.

        Watch this to the end, if you haven‚Äôt seen it, or even if you have.  It‚Äôs fun as hell.  I‚Äôm a gen-x‚Äôer.  So, I grew up in that perfect in-between age where the Golden Age movies were still staples year-round, but also as rock was ascending and R&amp;B/hip-hop/pop was getting started.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1F0lBnsnkEThe thing Z doesn‚Äôt really say, maybe he doesn‚Äôt have kids I don‚Äôt remember, is that kids today benefit tremendously from the Silents, Boomers and Gen-X‚Äôers in terms of music.  We play music that spans hundreds of years, and we have it all at our fingertips.  Our KIDS get to hear that regularly.  How many kids would call up ‚ÄúSummer Breeze‚Äù on Siri on a road trip?  Not just that they like the song, but that they prefer the Shaw-Blades remake over the Seals and Crofts original.  Then, switch gears to the Red Hot Chili Peppers ‚ÄúAdventures of Rain Dance Maggie‚Äù and then that Mylie Cyrus‚Äô ‚ÄúWrecking Ball‚Äù on a road trip skiing on Friday night?  Throw in a little classical, some disco, pull up some crooner from Bing, then over to ‚ÄúCats‚Äù, back around to ‚ÄúUptown Funk‚Äù, over to ‚ÄúO-o-phelia‚Äù (Lumineers), and wrap around and the whole family sings along with Sir Paul for ‚ÄúYesterday‚Äù.And shit, we‚Äôre not even to Denver yet!  Let‚Äôs go around the horn today.  How about a little Bon Jovi and some Journey, and then Beyonce singing ‚ÄúListen‚Äù (Dreamgirls soundtrack, one my daughter introduced me to)?  How about ‚ÄúA Fifth of Beethoven‚Äù (Walter Murphy), then listen to the original one, and over to ‚ÄúJupiter‚Äù (the Planets, Holst)?  Then back to something a little more current, like ‚ÄúThe Work Song‚Äù (Hosier) or ‚ÄúLazaretto‚Äù (Jack White)?  Oh, how about a little Blues Traveler ‚Äôcause they‚Äôre awesome?  Or some Collective Soul?  ‚ÄúPaint it, Black‚Äù?  Now we‚Äôre getting somewhere.That‚Äôs our Friday during ski season on the 2-hour drive into the mountains.  Round and round we go.Yeah, there‚Äôs less connection to the bands, but the kids do still identify with the bands.  It‚Äôs just harder to do because so many choices, so easy to access, so Twenty One Pilots needs to bring their A-game every time, often with genre-bending changes in style to stay on top.I love that about music today.  It‚Äôs boundless, which makes it fun.  Or, as I told my kids a few years ago when I got on a Tom Petty kick (buying all his back catalog on iTunes one weekend), ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs NEW TO ME.‚Äù  Doesn‚Äôt matter how old it is, great music is just great music.  The kids understand that better than any generation that came before.

            No, I alluded to the time factor. Look up Miley Cyrus singing ‚ÄúJolene‚Äù and then look up Dolly singing it. The former is a ham and egger, while the latter is a legend. We never had that ability, for the most part. The kids today get to compare the present with the past, with regards to lots of things, in ways that were impossible 20 years ago.

        Digital technology has allowed music and music making to proliferate to a level far beyond what was possible in the era in which you truly needed a studio to make a decent song.  The result, I think, is that modern music is some of the best music ever made (some of, no one‚Äôs ever topping Mozart).  The problem is hardly anyone has ever heard any of it.  We don‚Äôt yet have a good system for making a taxonomy of new music and getting individuals the best of the styles they enjoy.Popular music is the shit pumped out by the record companies.  Record companies are like print newspapers.  The new technology means they are irrelevant people clinging to the remnants of their former necessity.  We shouldn‚Äôt be surprised their products are just as awful as print media.

        Meaningful music is often the product of individual genius (or an ensemble of similar exceptional talents). Perhaps the dearth of good music is a manifestation of the absence of genius in modern music. In my view, good music inspires and reinforces creative thinking. Conversely, I have long contended that rap music actively destroys brain cells because it encodes simplistic repetitive mind states.
