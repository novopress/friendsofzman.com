        Regardless of outcome, the Trump trial removes all of the GAE’s pretensions of morality and ethics, and cements it as a corrupt, petty, ignorant garbage pit the rest of its run.
The judge has to act in a certain way in order to remain in good standing.
It isn’t that complicated. The judge is a profoundly stupid and low IQ Third World parasite. He perfectly embodies present day AINO.

            I was watching the news this morning with my daughter who has been asked to follow the events by one of her teachers as an extra credit assignment.After listening to the host state that the prosecution still has not pointed to a charge, my daughter asked me how this could go on this long without telling Trump what his crime is? I told her that everyone in this trial on the side of the prosecution has been promised something in return for getting Trump convicted, starting with the judge. You can make bank on the fact that if the left maintains control of the senate next year, look for this 3rd world, pitiful excuse for a quota hire to be ip for a spot on a federal bench. Look also for Aunt Lindsay to enthusiastically support him, knowing full well he’ll be given first dibs on the next wave of cabana boys to waltz across the border.

Nothing will happen. I don’t say that as condemnation for a failure to act. I’m just saying, if Trump goes to prison the brainwashed, atomized populace will not react in any concrete way.

        The Regime has really painted themselves into a corner with the show trials. Even if they “win”, they discredit themselves and the fragile perception of rule by law, publicly and irrevocably, and have made a political martyr of the Bad Orange Man, allowing him to assume the mantle of all of the political prisoners in Clown World in himself. He literally will become a Nelson Mandela figure in the perception of Normies. If they “lose” and the BOM goes free, they prove their incompetence, once again, and far from solidifying their punitive power through “legal” means, they invite a internal fracture by their incompetence.Either way, the results of this circus bode no good for the Regime going into the summer of 1859/2024.

            The best-case scenario is 1859, which strengthened the victor. The more likely outcome and worst-case scenario is the Gdansk shipyard strike in 1980 with Trump viewed–with justification–as Walesa. That uprising was the absolute precursor of the fall of the Soviet Empire, which may have been less unstable than the GAE at that particular time.

                It still amazes me that these people, who never tire of comparing the BOM to Mustache Guy, literally don’t understand that the 1924 MunichPutschtrial is what made Mustache Guy a hero to many Germans, who then voted their way out of Wiemar. Yet they blindly, stubbornly and implacably are trying their hardest to do exactly the same exactly 100 years later, like they simply can’t understand the parallels.

                    Very few of them know of let alone understand the dynamics of the 1924 trial, and the handful who do are too high on their own supply to realize they are doing the exact same thing. It always astonished me that the Soviets didn’t kill Walesa, but at least they knew the backlash would be enormous. His brief detentions increased his popularity and the Soviets knew it. This crew is too unstable even to consider second order effects.We really need a term for rule by psychopaths because “totalitarianism” and “police state” and the like come up short. It becomes all the more serious when they cavalierly discuss nuclear war. Obama’s former ambassador to Moscow routinely blows off nuclear war as a distraction. Crazy, all the way down.

                            Kakistocracy lacks emotional punch. The idea needs to gain traction among people who still believe in elections and watch football. You can’t sell an African an air conditioner if you call it a Thermal Regulation Binary Selector.

                        I’ve read articles and quotes from prominent leaders of those people over the centuries who say as much. Even before Mustache Man came onto the scene. The issue is it is not 1924 anymore. It is not 1994. They can’t shape the narrative like they used to, the way they did for so many decades is totally obsolete, like bow and arrow vs. guns. The quick death of the “40 decapitated babies” storyline should have been a wake-up call, but it doesn’t seem that it was.

                    The Fuhrer had sections of the establishment on his side — the Wehrmacht, industrialists, and so on. Plus the Weimar Republic was weak and fragile. Oh, and mustn’t forget the massive SA paramilitary force. There is no comparison.

                        Trump or any other right winger is not comparable, like you say. Any totalitarian ruler in the US would have to come from the left, because they dominate all the institutions.Imagine somebody left enough to hold onto the (D)irtbag coalition of crooks, but who is able to garner support from the productive private sector – like,  creating jobs by closing the borders, or vilifying a class of enemies (they keep trying to do this to white males).AH became very popular because he was a socialist who created millions of jobs with big govt spending ( on war macht). A lefty freak might try warring against global warming (like Biden has).

                    They would be replaced before they could staple their cardboard to the stick. Dubai was an eye opener for The Regime. They will just ship helots in from any province across any ocean. Unlike Dubai, where those helots will be nothing and nowhere people, the ones here will be told to stay, taught to hate the Americans and will be invited to participate in the upcoming jubilees that will declare that they built America.

        I had a conversation over the long weekend with  some old friends which reminded me of Derb’s “We Are Doomed. They were proudly telling me about their son who is a pilot. They shared a photo he’d taken when he was piloting a massive cargo plane out of Afghanistan. He took a photo of the more than 400 afghans he was helping to evacuate after that debacle. I made a comment about all those new Americans. They were defensive and informed me that not allof them came to America, many went to Germany.It’s extraordinary. This is a family with whom I had very frank discussions about immigration back in 2016. They instantly loved Trump for all the right reasons and remain supporters to this day. They are good, decent, honest people.White people are pathologically and suicidally altruistic.Even the deplorables.

            Awhile back I came across a poll (as reported in the media; can’t recall the source) of MAGA loyalists’ views on various foreign policy issues.  It basically tracked with what you’d expect to hear from John Bolton or Liz Cheney.Was it accurate? Who knows?  We’re awash in lies &amp; propaganda.  But itdidring true.  I get the sense that a lot of normie-cons still associate patriotism with hoo-rah global meddling — and, of course, many are to the right of Bibi when it comes to Our Greatest Ally.Ditto with having internalized the DR3 stuff and “legal, not illegal!” mantra.  It’s hard to break the relentess social conditioning, I guess.

        They way I see it, they can but they won’t survive him for very long. A lot of people around don’t seem to know what to do, but they do seem to be connecting the dots that even if they peacefully protest they are going to be treated like they planned to take out every politician in the country simultaneously. When the elite’s actions cause that kind of conflation, you either get a herd of cattle too scared to do anything at all, or a group of people who are willing to put it all on the line because there’s no other choice.From where I’m sitting, neither option looks very pretty

        Generally I don’t knock someone for doing what they do for a living, or even try to analyze it too much. The world needs proctologists and morticians, even if I don’t want to have dinner with or shake the hand of every one of them. There seems to be something corrupting, though, perverting, about people asked to have proximity to real power while never really having it themselves; the snooty nose-in-the-air waiter at the expensive restaurant, the haughty bank teller who spends all day counting large sums while not earning much; the butler answering the door in the mansion. Even the really big grifter politicians—your Pelosi and Clinton types—seem to only feel envy and resentment for those who cut the big checks. It enrages them, but they can’t take out that rage on the more powerful, so who does that leave? Everyone else.Our managerial class look at us the way Smithers looks at Homer when Homer is sent to answer for something on Burns’ plush carpet. Or like a house slave watching an uppity buck toil in the fields through the window. Trump’s refusal to just cut checks for others and shut up really pissed them off—especially when he’d peel back the curtain at his rallies and name the actual industries involved, and implicated himself. That he showed the fighting class of dirt people wasn’t too happy with the wars dreamed up by “the best and brightest” also sent our bloodthirsty Galician friends over the edge.Even worse—and most inexplicable from their perspective, I think—is that he’s doing all this not only not for his own gain, but very much to his financial and now physical detriment. The more his reputation plunges with them, the more it rises with people who know the difference between officially sanctioned bravery (re: cowardice) and the actual thing (re: what Trump is showing.) I’m through qualifying every statement about Trump with a “For all his faults…” caveat. The guy has done something truly remarkable.Now it’s just a question of what kind of matter/antimatter reaction happens when the elite hatred for him and the hoi polloi love of him swell to the point where they can’t help but impinge on each other, causing an explosion. Let’s hope all those hysterical scenarios gamed out by the loons for 2024 lead to chaos that provides an opening for actual change. I just don’t see things continuing on like this for much longer. Ten years? Five years? Maybe six months…

        Perhaps this explains why these people turned on Elon Musk so quickly. For years, they thought he was one of them. They thought that he existed to confer status onto them. His cars were a way for them to separate from the dirty proles driving in gross climate change vehicles. Well, it turns out that he, too, is his own man and could do whatever he wants. He decided to buy Twitter on a whim. Twitter was, at the time, was the managerial class’ primary tool for virtue signaling, setting the narrative, and, most importantly, punishing the transgessors. There was an incompetent Indian as CEO but in reality Yoel Roth was running the company and he was a good manager just like them. Elon took that away from them and allowed badthinkers back on the service, in effect separating them from the owner. Now they hate him and have been predicting the death of the service and Elon’s total destruction for years now.I have to admit I haven’t spent more than 5 minutes following this trial. It is a farce. Something interesting though – the normie right and even Revolver News has been posting about how the judge was DESTROYED and Cohen was OWNED and all that, deluding the grillers into thinking justice will be served and the rule of law will prevail. I wonder what they will think when he is convicted and reality hits them in the face yet again.

        Go get some land, and bring a neighbor or two who is aware that the struggle isn’t over a country that is long gone. It is over the survival of the people who built it all and who want to someday have their descendants build a new one that can surpass the one we inherited. Build schools, build communities that are tightly woven and that have the cultural and technological means to ride and drive the waves of technological innovation and cultural decay to supplant a dying order after surviving the consequences of its unprecedented madness.

                Yes. However, build a top flight community around you so that someday you will build and maintain your own reactor(s), 3D printing farms, drone factories to go along with your agriculture, traditionally elite calibre schools … … …
Archeofuturism is the future. We either start building it now, or all is lost – forever.

        Trump “is a self-made man.” This is THE precise reason they hate him; he’s an individualist &amp; to the drones in the managerial class (who never create anything of worth)  that makes him a threat simply because he’s better than them. He’s a creator/problem solver/fixer. They can’t have that. Crises are to be managed &amp; exploited for their political opportunity, not “solved.”

            I disagree.  They hate Trump because they hate us. They hate him because he appeals to us.  Getting a conviction proves they are the good guys and we are the bad guys.Plus, I’m sure they resent him for the reasons mentioned in today’s essay.  But it’s not like Trump had been an unknown. I first heard of Donald of Trump in the late 80s.  He was somewhat of a celebrity at the time.  From what I know, his fame goes back even further in NYC.  But when he came down that escalator and declared that Mexico was not sending their best, it resonated with everyday people in the country who have to pay the cost of all these foreigners in our country while the elite and managerial classes generally only get the benefits.  Their hatred for him grew as his popularity with the masses increased.

                In ’80s NYC he was the vulgarian villain of the old- and finance-money establishment and their kids (the media). I first remember clichés like“what losers think a winner is like” from their descriptions of Trump and his fans, then mostly rappers, swarthy merchants, and gangsters going legit. He was a specific local style of folk hero that came across differently to normal Americans, more like a camp gadfly, Liberace without a boy hidden in his room. I never saw his later TV shows, but they toughened up his image just enough to take that weird sissy edge off (almost always). A mistake.

                    I don’t think I’ve ever seen any of the TV shows.  I only know him from around the late 80s and early 90s and then in 2015.  During that whole period of the 2000s and 2010s, I did not turn on a TV set.  I got laid off in the early 2000s tech collapse and I cancelled my satellite TV and just never got it again because I didn’t really miss it.  If people weren’t talking about Trump’s show once in a while, I wouldn’t have even known he had a show.Trump was very much portrayed in the Philadelphia/South Jersey media (being an Atlantic city mogul) as a kind of “everyman” billionaire (if such a thing could exist) and pretty positively.  He had a bankruptcy and Wawa (a big 7-11 type chain here named after an Indian tribe) put donation jars in their stores.  It was all very cheeky.  He talked about himself in the 3rd person “if they get it, Trump should get it too…” which I thought was pretty weird at the time.  That was really the only impression I had at the time.

        If it’s accurate that Biden already prepared remarks for after the verdict, the fix is obviously in.
Has the judge already made assurances that a “directed verdict” is on the table if the jury reaches the “wrong” conclusion?

        One of the strangest part of the elite class now is how none of them actually know who the owner is. They are slaves who have no idea who their master is, so they senselessly flap about with the latest trend hoping they stay in good standing.Take this pitiful specimen for instance. He rails against white males, who he assumes have all the power, gets browbeaten by a POC who got her job through DEI while emphasizing the poor sap who can’t get a job actually has all the power (i.e. is an owner). It’s as close to a cluster of ants following each other around in a circle until they die as you’re ever going to see.https://x.com/hradzka/status/1794944210321428556

That really is the same thing as Z described. They may want to be priests, but they are actors, clowns and carnies who read scripts. “Managers” is too generous. Trump actually believed the system was what it seemed, maybe still believes it, and that made the final reveal all the more potent.

        It’s not just the managerial class that fears truly men capable of building things. The donor class – the ultimate rulers – are a finance/middle-man people. They are also very small in numbers and disliked by all who know them.
Even though they rule (via bribery, blackmail and lawfare), they are always vulnerable. They can’t build a society on their own. They don’t have the numbers to rule. And they have no loyal Praetorian Guard. They understand this, which is why they lash out so violently when opposed, even a little.

            You could have fooled me about not having a Praetorian Guard. I get some (thankfully sound muted) exposure to what’s on the MSM news from the big screens on the wall at the gym I go to, and the other day I saw that they had Andrew McCabe on there opining about the Trump trial (along with George Conway). Men who have been doing it so long, 8 years and running, you can now say they’ve made a career out of TDS. McCabe of course being a product of that Praetorian Guard. I see they’ve recently trotted out James Comey again too.

Just like in the declining Roman empire, there is a Praetorian Guard, but it’s loyal to noone but itself, and will pick and choose rulers as it suits them.  How else to explain Joey Diapers as president.

                    It’s hard to believe it is loyal only to itself, entirely self directing. However, some (but not all) of its loyalty is to the woke religion which has overtaken it. Speaking of Comey again, a fine example of that. It wouldn’t surprise me if he sends a kwanzaa card to his wife’s boyfriend after he gets home from marching in a pussy hat.

            Mmmmm….. I don’t think that is true. They train the FBI. We also do not know how many of their agents are infiltrated throughout our security state at key positions. One of theirs was key in promoting JCOS Brown and many years ago too. Of course the ethnic cleansing of white men from the military and the swelling of the ranks and officer core with the Trannissaries and non-white people is another client group. This is also 2024. Netanyahu has for years now been going to the globalist conferences selling Israel as the data center and microchip center of the world. They will host the new powers.Well, thanks to DIE, the Chips Act was laughed at by Taiwanese companies and instead of chip plants in America, they are putting one in Japan, and SURPRISE, one in Israel. How convenient that DIE gets them closer to their goal. From the sound of it, they want to be the data center of the global panopticon.They also sell all of the TSA equipment and train all of the TSA/DHS staff using their home country’s Praetorians. Now they are proposing legislation to get IDF veterans onto the US veterans benefit roll.I see your point. However, I would not underestimate what DIE, Trannys, Womyn, Womyn, Womyn and these things have been doing for quite some time. They may well have constructed their own guard. Certainly Mayorkas must be surrounded by loyalists for he knows how hated he is inside of the ranks of the CBP.

        I’m still looking forward to seeing the reaction of the grifters of Con., Inc. to this week’s events.  They’ve been assiduously avoiding any but the slightest mention of this elephant trial and this week they’re going to be asked to come out in favor of locking up Trump.  “Rule of law … blah, blah.  Muh’ Principles .. blah, blah.  Nimrata Nadadanawanna … blah, blah.”While the GOP doesn’t have the slightest qualm about selling out their voters, I also think there is a conviction on their part that they can get behind locking up Trump and taking him off the ballot without suffering any long term consequences.  Lose some seats this year.  Pick up a few in 2026.  Back to business as usual.  I think they’re wrong about that and the party will totally implode – taking the rats of Con., Inc. down with the ship – but we shall see.

            Yep. Even without the show trials, this likely would have been the GOP’s last national election. Normie is gonna Normie but even he sees the Republicans as total frauds now. The GOP will encourage its cultists to support and trust the system, because that is its role, but only the dead-enders will do so with a straight face. Sean Hannity will encourage his listeners to vote harder in 2026, but he is preaching to a dwindling choir.
The death of the Republican Party will be a joyous day.

            I beg to differ on that part, a friend of mine is involved in GOP politics at the state level in PA. According to her, party leaders are acutely aware that the rank and file are livid and have had it with party leadership. Not that that really means anything mind you, the road of history is littered with the desiccated remains of “Well we knew and really should have done x, but……”

        We have the vestiges of an old-time religion called “democracy”. The Elections and Trials are just rituals now to propitiate the Gods. No serious person really thinks they still have any meaning, especially after OJ, St. George and the 2020 ballot farce. But the rituals seem to soothe some of the normies. Hypocrisy is the tribute vice pays to virtue.

        Completely off-topic, but, since you are American people and have a lot of contact with Indian people (dot, not feather), you may inform me. Thank you in advance if you can do it.I have just had a virtual job interview with a panel of two Indian people. The boss went out of his way to belittle me, to imply I was a liar (I was not), saying that the division I used to work did not exist (it did), trying to find every detail of an unrelated job so it could discover that I had lied (the name of my previous boss, for example). After he failed to do so, he gave me a difficult logical problem to solve but this was not related to the job competencies (this was an e-learning job). I told him that this was not a technical question and that, if he wanted to find an excuse to disqualify me, we could finish the interview. And I hanged out.This is my second interview with an Indian person and the first one was similar. Not that extreme. After explaining one of my accomplishments, he said that this was no accomplishment because it was present in each office of the organization (it was not, in fact no office had it).I understand that he may have wanted to hire another Indian guy and he wanted to disqualify me (I am white – fair skin – and my experience was very good for this post). But many people disqualify me in interviews without being so rude and dishonest. It is enough to do it after the interview.I am trying to make sense of all this. Is it that Indian people enjoy humiliating White people? Are they resentful? They get a kick out of it? What are your experiences?

            Yes. Have had same prob w/ doctors from there. One flat out said “Let’s get this straight from the beginning. I will tell you what to do, and you will do it.” They have the idea, when they come to this rural area, that we are all “uneducated hicks” and treat us all, regardless of background, accordingly. Have to search out white male doctors, not always easy here. (Does this come from growing up in a caste-based society? Or is it just racism against whites?)

                Having spent a lot of time around Indians and having had the double misfortune of having visited India as well, basically they treat each other like this too.In much of the non-White world, the dictum is Fellate Up, Kick Down. You as a job applicant are a supplicant and therefore you will be kicked. It is expected of course, that you will fellate up in the hope of demonstrating that you are sufficiently talented in that department to be worthy of more gentle kicking.It is not so easy for C21 Whites to grasp this. Of course it is more than likely that the Pajeet gave OP an extra hard kicking merely for being White.As both Humpty Dumpty and Lenin both grokked, the only question really is Who Will Rule? Everything else is second or third order at best.

        The problem with this whole analysis is that Trump has functionally already been assimilated by the regime.  It’s pretty obvious at this point that he went to the Supreme Jew in his volcano lair and pledged his undying loyalty to the Demiurge in exchange for being allowed to be president again.

        The true significance of the Trump trial in NY is the obvious revelation that the judicial system is thoroughly corrupt and represents a clear and present danger to our society. There is a belief that this injury can be washed away when the Appeals Court overturns the verdict, but that is naive in my opinion. The country is now more divided than ever. Some cheer (but fewer than most think) and others seethe with hatred toward a broken system that has now made it personal. God help the LEOs that must face the pitchfork mob, for they will first bear the brunt of this anger and it will be ugly. In a truly just world, this anger would solely find its home on the doorstep of those responsible for this travesty.

That’s just it. They won’t face the “pitchfork mob”. We have seen example after example of LEO’s standing down in front of such mobs. The demoralization is almost complete. When you see extreme responses, it is now most often associated with a direct attack upon LEO’s. In short, the public be damned. Who can blame them?

        Well Z – you said you liked the fact that Trump was a wrecking ball… and given the way things are going I can’t say I blame ya.Far as I’m concerned – it’s all good. The stage is no set for the next stage. All we have to do is decide what we want. Balkanization and peaceful coexistence? Or civil war? The shit heads on the other side of this are not the only ones wanting vengeance now. I’m past the fake investigations, trials, and inquiries. I want consequences. At this point, if some brown shirted thugs came in the middle of the night to carry off these clowns and make them disappear, I’d just smile and maybe go down to the pub and buy a round for the house.You can’t run a country like this.

        The system made Trump no less than it made his persecutors. Trump is a man of the system. He really is Julius Caesar; the historical parallels are uncanny. He crossed the Rubicon and made a successful march upon Rome, to great popular fanfare, in response to which the Optimates (represented today by the Neoliberals, i.e. the big-money interests) rallied to defend “our democracy,” by which they mean the slough of imperial spoils ever oozing towards the Capitol.The reason the Optimates hate Trump is not because of personal envy or “slave morality.” They hate him because of the unbounded and entirely unofficial power that he wields. Trump represents the end of their control, and they think that by getting rid of him they can reassert themselves. However, the historical forces that gave rise to Trump are now unleashed and the changes cannot be undone. The Optimates are destined to lose their place as we drift into the formless conflicts of the fully consolidated imperium.

            Everybody who is rich and famous at the level of Trump and other well known oligarchs are a product of the system—political and economic.  How could it not be so?  The reason he is hated and feared is that he is not part of the ruling cabal (describe such as you will).  What we often term the “uniparty”.As a rich playboy, his allegiance was not particularly vetted or perhaps even assumed, and he was allowed free rein when he stayed apolitical.  He turned political and unexpectedly achieved the highest office in the land riding on a wave of populist discontent.  There is some precedent for such people and the reaction of the uniparty to them with Schwarzenegger and Ventura.  Unknown quantities are scary.  At the governor level bothSchwarzenegger and Ventura were neutralized.Trump at the presidential level could not as easily be controlled.  He simply did not play ball, or perhaps rather sent out the wrong signals to the uniparty (that there was a new sheriff in town.)   The rest is history.ID, you have the correct understanding in this matter.  Your verbiage simply is too poetic.

            “They hate him because of the unbounded and entirely unofficial power that he wields.”
It is simpler to state that Trump is a populist icon and represents a populist uprising of the “dirts”.  As Trump has said, “…They’re not after me, they’re after you.  I’m just standing in the way.”  Whether Trump is  man of the people or not is beside the point.

        It really is amazing watching the corrupt regime and its toadies preparing to convict Trump on utterly bogus “charges” while at the same time enthusiastically backing Israel’s continuing civilian slaughter and more aggressively prodding the Russian bear.  There’s all sorts of unintended or perhaps intended consequences that will more likely than not erupt this summer.  While the end can’t come soon enough for the GAE, unlike the Soviet’s deflated end, this government’s will probably entail even more than the usual death and destruction they foist on the rest of the world.

                Absolutely, vladdy, it causes panicked screeching, that is, hysteria.Having feminized brains, they act like outraged women who’ve been caught.“But you should dump!!” cry the righteous.Nah. When you realize they don’t know squat and aren’t serious, you treat them as you would a woman. You’re being teased because you’re being courted…“sh*t-tested” (fitness testing) is the term; they are seeing if you’re willing to play, or if you’re afraid of them (how much can they get away with.)Diflect, a witty or stupid quip, distract; lead them off in a new direction.They just want somebody who makes them laugh.And, it turns out, so do I. We can’t do much about any of these dog-whistles or the state of the world, so why be serious? They are acting out, expressing their own anxiety or wanting attention, as little kids tend to do. So play.

        On St. Thomas Aquinas saying the saints in heaven will see the divine justice of the punishment of the damned, it comes from Psalm 91:8: “You will only observe with your eyes and see the punishment of the wicked.”https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-8.htm

            It has been a long time since we had to read bits of Summa Theologiae, but my recollection is Aquinas addresses the objections to this and comes down on the side of the righteous relishing the suffering of the wicked.

                To the extent it exists as God’s justice, yes. Dante gets there in the inferno, but it’s about understanding that relatively speaking, it’s about people who have rejected righteousness/God himself getting what they wanted all along.  It’s bit unfair to at least possibly suggest that Aquinas’ lifetime of work is summarized as “Petty people should enjoy the suffering of their enemies.”

                It’s not quite that. It’s being okay with watching God’s enemies burn, because they simply would not make the choice that the saints did, which is to love God. There are formerly wicked people in Heaven, but they repented of it and were willing to undergo correction. Some the damned will include your enemies, but unfortunately it will also include friends and family, too. 🙁

            In reading the whole Psalm, it’s not clear that it’s a discussion of the afterlife. Most Psalms suffer (or maybe it’s a feature) of being ambiguous about their timeframes. Psalm 91 could easily apply to this life as well.

        I find it overall misleading to equate the modern managerial class with the priesthood of a religion.
Mainstream totalitarian leftism is fundamentally oppositional, therefore incoherent, labile, self-contradicting; consequently without a stable goal.
Modern managers therefore see themselves (absurd, but true) as radicals, a revolutionary vanguard. Continually subverting.then inverting. A step ahead of the masses.
Nothing like this, no such group (and global in scope) has existed before recently.

                “Every society has a priestly class.”
You can make that an assumption, and then it cannot formally be disproved by any possible evidence.
The question is whether doing so is helpful to understanding – or a hindrance.

                Quite so, and better said, Mr. Gottfried.They are “angels”, in the proper archaic translation of the word: “messengers” from those on high.
Exactly what a preisthood, found in every society, even the most primitive pre-literate Amazon jungle tribes, does.  Religion is a part of the human social ecology.
(Mr. bgc, I assume your viewpoint is monotheist, that is, “you can’t have a religion without God,” since you use a derivative of “you can’t disprove a negative,” in your second reply.)

                @PG – I think a better and more precise word for what you call “religion” is “ideology” – since if you define religion in the secular way you do, then you need to invent another concept for… “religion”, in the pre 1800 sense.BTW – I think it is uncontroversial that there was No priest class in nomadic hunter gatherer societies – which was essentially All human societies through prehistory until c 12000 years ago.What this means is that a priest class is Not a necessary feature of human society; but contingent upon sedentary and agrarian societies and afterwards (including sedentary hunter gatherers, such as the Pacific NW Indians)*.To state matters rather over-simply; I would suggest that a priest class is most usefully defined as a feature of the agrarian societies that came after hunter-gatherers and before the industrial revolution…After which the priest class has been replaced by bureaucracy (mangers); religion by secular ideology; and the net-cohesive social function of religions, by the net-fissile social effect of the mass media –http://addictedtodistraction.blogspot.com.*For a bibliography see the references to: hedweb.com/bgcharlton/evolpsych.html

        “There have always been two sides to punishment.”
There is a third side to punishment: artificial selection.  The king molds society the way an artist molds clay by selecting out those who can not for whatever reason follow his rules.  Thus the king is the father of civilization.  Democracy is the mother of chaos

        The meme that the polls are fake is taking a hit right now, as we watch Trump’s lead increase in all of them, across the board, as his trial goes on. Why would the regime do that? Either the polls are done in relatively good faith, or the fix is in for Trump, those are the only two possible answers.

            There is a third choice. The polls are rigged to fit the media narrative at the moment. Right now, the admin is floundering, especially in their support for Israel, so the media narrative is negative, thus the polls are negative. At some point in the near future the new narrative will be that Biden is making a comeback, maybe after the debate and then we see the polls change.
Polling is a product sold to the media. The customer is always right.

                I can’t see it Z. There is not now and never has been such a thing as a pro Trump media narrative. If there’s a third possibility, it’s that it’s part of a gambit to replace Biden on the ticket.

                “Polling is a product sold to the media. The customer is always right.”Exactly.  I’ve said this before.  There are two types of polls:  Those for internal consumption, those for external consumption.  The external consumption ones are for political maneuvering/narrative/click-bait.  (There are to be fair, some independent smallish, academic-type polls, but they rarely get the publicity their independence/validity merits.)We have a friend in the business—or was in the business—and the ways these polls are contracted for and implemented finally drove her to quit the business.  In my discussions with her, she never surprised me with such details since I have bit of background in this “science”.Z-man—as usual—succinctly summarized the situation… “the customer is always right”.

                Maybe, maybe not. I just assumed Trump would lose, but the Israel-Gaza war might have changed that. Sure, Biden, is 100% on Team Israel, but the Dems are having a hard time controlling their Golem.
The GOP and Trump are more on Team Israel than the Israelis. Our rulers hate Trump, but they might need him for the next year or two.

        “There is no one who enjoys vengeance more than the priest. The suffering of the wicked is the greatest joy to the truly righteous. For the managerial class, punishing those who transgress and seeing them suffer is their reward. It is why the media love ruining people. It makes them feel like Aquinas relishing the image of the damned writhing in the pits of hell. This is why this case matters so much. The managerial priests will get to see a wicked man suffer.”Excellent article overall, except this paragraph, which was a bit of a clunker for me.Thomas Aquinas was a Christian philosopher first and foremost. By all accounts a gentile giant with a sort of absented minded professors interaction style. I can see the managerial elite making the mistaking enjoyment of people in Hell conveniently for others makes them Aquinas. I think Aquinas would politely disagree however and the rest of us should acknowledge that.If we limit the discussion to Catholic priests in the US, no they don’t enjoy vengeance generally. Indeed they are supposed to be bearing suffering for Christ. Do priests exist like that? Of course. That’s life in a fallen world. Is a vengeful spirit an inherent part of being a priest? I don’t think so. My personal experience is they tend towards a passivity that at times is a little frustrating.Further, men in general are not quite as prone to wanting vengeance as women. I would tend to think that the best analogy (as woman), is that of an effeminate elite scorned. It’s not hard to see that some of this dynamic is a female mindset reacting to, for better or worse, a lot of testosterone.

            It is a very slow process. The question is what would happen between conviction and appeal. My guess is the judge locks him up. It is utterly counterproductive and further diminishes whatever little standing the GAE has, but it is who these people are.

                I had been “meh” about whether the trials were “helpful,” and tended to think they weren’t. But we have watched in real time the legal system so disqualify itself that it is jaw-dropping. More Machiavellian, let alone intelligent, prosecutors would encourage the judge to allow Trump to remain free pending appeal and that would be ordered. Neither the dindu prosecutor nor the Third World savage judge will do so. It actually will empower Trump to do some time, likely under house arrest, in the meantime. If they had been less grasping and more subtle that might not have been the case, but these people are incapable of even slight restraint.The best outcome for “Biden” and the GOP at this point would be a hung jury or outright acquittal, neither likely, but in case of dissent Merchan will keep the jury deliberating until they reach his desired verdict. These are functionally retarded totalitarians and not even able to pursue their own best interests.

        I appreciate Z Man’s writings on managerialism because it is a perspective on our predicament that doesn’t come naturally to me. I tend to focus on the power of tribalism and the ability of the media to dictate our morality as primary explanations.While Z Man catalogs the mechanisms and problems of managerialism, I don’t recall him every discussing an alternative to it.Federalism and local control seem to be protection against managerialism, but they don’t scale up when a country becomes large.Can there be a large, modern country that does converge on managerialism? Is managerialism inherent in scaling up a large country?

                Managerialism is not so much the presence of a managerial class (which would exist in any large organization regardless of constitution), it is the fact that the managerial class subsumes all the trappings of sovereignty because there is no one above it telling it what to do. Managerialism is really just a fancy name for “parliament governing without the king.” It is by definition an interregnal period when the king is dead and his retainers form a committee to govern in his absence. It comes to an end when a new sovereign and a new dynasty assumes the throne.

                The trick is to not scale up a large country, but to scale down. All problems stem from a consolidation of power in Washington.  The original concept of the Founders was for a weak central government and a strong state government (relatively) and as few laws as possible to constrain the people, hence the Constitution which addresses what the government *can not do* for the most part.
Of course that was another time and another demographic.

                        Whether Z-man disagrees or not, the intent is(was) to distribute power/authority as close to those affected (masses) as possible.  The theory being that there is a possibility to have more control the farther out (closer to the masses) decisions are made.  This was once the norm and accepted, but as soon as the Civil War ended, things went downhill fast with the consolidation and extension of power in Washington.
I suspect Z-man talks more of the impossibility to go back in time and reverse our current dilemma, not necessarily the concept of distributed power.

        There is no one who enjoys vengeance more than the priest. The suffering of the wicked is the greatest joy to the truly righteous. For the managerial class, punishing those who transgress and seeing them suffer is their reward. It is why the media love ruining people. It makes them feel like Aquinas relishing the image of the damned writhing in the pits of hell.

        A self-made man can never be an ‘aristocrat of the old sort.’ That requires lineage going back generations. Trump is not really self-made either; he inherited his wealth and has not done too well with what he inherited. That said, I voted for him twice and will do so again (given the chance). This travesty of a trial would be a disgrace in any civilised nation and just goes to show that there’s no rule of law in the USA anymore. We’ll most likely be lumbered with that worthless p.o.s. Biden for four more years. As the country swirls the drain, I expect a steady exodus of people to greener pastures abroad.

                    Your jealousy is showing through pretty badly right now. You may not like him and denigrate his accomplishments but all it does is point out what you haven’t done with your life. Believe it or not money isn’t everything, Trump could have put his inheritance in index funds and be worth untold amounts more right now. But do you think that if he could go back and change things, he would do it? No, he can look back on his life and look at everything he’s accomplished and see how he has become the most famous man in the world perhaps, dated and married beautiful women, built things, become a TV star, had good citizen children and everything else. I’m sure he wouldn’t change much at all. And to top it off he became president for better or worse.He could have been a trust fund playboy with no real accomplishments, no fame who left nothing behind after his life. But he didn’t, you can argue whether he made the world a better place but he has surely made it a different place.

                        I don’t see AA as denigrating Trump and being jealous of him. I think AA made a proper point which is that being an aristocrat entails a bunch of things, including the preceding generational legacy, that Trump is not.That said, what Baron and his children and grand children do may cement Trump as the beginning of an aristocratic line.I think both of you are right here. We live in some rough times and being frustrated is understandable. Let’s aim our animosity at real enemies with effective actions when the time is right. In the meantime, let’s build bonds and things that will allow us to weather the very rough storms ahead.

            ”Trump is not really self-made either; he inherited his wealth”You are going to have to cite your sources on that one.  The story I’ve always heard is that Trump was grub-staked by his father in early real estate deals, but after never looked back.  There is a record of the father’s holdings upon death and Trump’s then current holdings.  Trump’s reputation was that of outdoing his father in the business.  Has anyone compared the two?The accusation seems to be here that Trump inherited the bulk of his wealth, but I don’t see that.  That ‘s not to say that Trump did not always exaggerate his wealth and success in business.  He branded himself, and therefore had to exaggerate—it was good for business to be seen as having the Midas Touch.The old saw that Trump inherited most all his wealth seems like a typical slur we hear wrt many wealthy individuals.

                Trump’s father was the one with business acumen. Trump himself, not so much. Look, I voted for him and will probably throw a bit of money his way. Plus there are self-made billionaires vastly richer than him — if I have to be jealous, it should be of them. Trump’s career is littered with bankruptcies and failed ventures. He’s not Bezos or Gates.

                    “He’s not Bezos or Gates.”This is not about whether trump is richer than these men or typical dot-com billionaires.  Trump made his money in construction and not dot-com tech growth.  Not easy to make billions in construction as it was in filling tech vacuums.  Construction has always been a crowded play ground.However the challenge still remains.  Trump made more money–a lot more–than his father ever did in the construction business.  His bankruptcies are strictly part of the game as no one, I mean no one, of any wealth does any investment under their own name, but rather through corporations they set up.  If a venture goes “south” they pull the plug and move on.

            The idea that Trump inherited his wealth and then slowly blew it – in such a way that he’d be wealthier if he had just invested it in the market ( or whatever) is disproved by his own family.   He has 3 living siblings that inherited similar amounts from Fred as Donald did – and none of them are as wealthy as Trump. – not by a long shot.

        This is all simply too cartoonish to be actually happening. You are watching a movie. One of two things is going on:1. These people have been previously caught in wrongdoing, such as Jack Smith railroading Senator Ted Stevens. The spotlight is being put on them so that the normies know who they are. Fauci is another one. Milley is another one. Maybe we do get public trials or maybe the point is just to shame them.2. They’ve got Judas goats out there spreading the word to their apparatchiks to do this, to sabotage Trump either as part of a sting or as a massive “I was just following orders” psyop lesson. (Sundance at conservative treehouse has also said similar things.)The government has always been doing these things. Nothing would be happening this obviously unless somebody wanted us to see it.Or maybe it’s just a warning shot to the next wannabe Trump.We’ll see.

            I don’t believe that evidence of regime malfeasance is indicative of some attempt by the regime to bring it to normie’s attention. It’s just that there is SO MUCH of it that it can’t all be kept quiet. Most of it is in dissident or right leaning media, not in the MSM.
This has always been a warning shot to the next Trump

        You cannot use campaign funds for inappropriate reasons. We are a system of laws not of men. No one is above the law. I voted for Trump twice and would again but the law is the law. I’m disappointed that he will be imprisoned and disqualified from the presidential race but a healthy just society respects the law.

            This is the Tiny Duck character, in case anyone is unclear.
It is an interesting case in that the government is arguing that all expenditures by a candidate, no matter how trivial and unrelated to his campaign, must be treated as campaign expenses. What they are arguing for, in effect, is a system in which only unemployed people can run for office and no rich person can self-fund his campaign. The wage slaves want rule by wage slave.

                The actual Tod Browning had that distinctive single d, a great name for a horror director. A real person would copy it. A “lifelong Republican” wouldn’t.Court decisions since Brexit &amp; Trump have been an echoing announcement of lawlessness.The system makes no argument. Nothing is a precedent. There are designated winners and losers. You stand before the law, it sees which one you are, and it rewards or punishes you.A normal person understands this and tries to conceal himself from the law’s eye. For a great-ish man Trump is unusually normal, but he doesn’t havethatinstinct. Instead, faced with doom, he becomes symbolic.

                This is the weak spot in a tyranny. If it is constructed ad hoc by the pets, then eventually it can be turned against the people who created it. It is only a matter of time before a pet or group of pets has some personal vendetta against someone higher up the pecking order and tries to turn the tyranny against the regime itself. It is only a matter of time before a rogue elite or set of rogue elites exploit the tyrannyThat is when things get interesting.Get your land. Recruit your neighbors. Build your redoubt with an eye toward the next 100 years. That is the only thing we control. The rest is theater and circuses that we should do all we can to stay far away from.

                Fine, he’s a recurrence of our old friend, Tiny Duck. Thanks for the memories.   However, too many such postings can/will become disruptive.  Please consider a strong reaction to such commenters.  Heretofore, such as in today’s commentary, a pretty good back and forth, productive exchange of opinion has been had among contributors—and I note that our contributor base is growing.  This is a good thing that should be protected and nurtured.

                        Yep. In the case of a troll, the intent becomes obvious as their speech is intended to disrupt other’s rightful claim to free expression in the forum. More than one forum has fallen prey to such. Since Z-man refuses to allow blocking by users of comment threads or specific individuals, he reserves the role of final say in who posts what—it’s his blog.One rose does not a Spring make, however Z-man was the one to recollect the notorious troll “Tiny Duck” who was banned. I myself let the comment pass as an aberration, but note the poster.Whether he is a resurgence of the spirit of “Tiny Duck” remains to be seen. I simply recommend a careful eye upon users who repeatedly post inane, off topic, and disruptive comments for the sake of incitement (or perhaps simple cluelessness)—not necessarily simple differences of opinion.As with so many of our “imaginary” rights, free speech is not a right nor unlimited—when you play in someone else’s back yard.

            So I guess you missed the part that Trump is being prosecuted fornotreporting the non-disclosure payment as a campaign expense, but as a legal (non-campaign) expense. Your comment presumes an event in some alternative universe in which Trump’s accountantshadbooked such payment as a campaign expense; whereupon he could have been charged for misappropriation of campaign funds. You are also apparently unaware that being in prison in no way disqualifies one from running for for the office of president (it’s been done before). You seemlamentablyignorant of the law for someone who claims his health depends on respecting it.

                Yep.  One thing I would note is that respect for the law must entail “understanding” of the law.  This prosecution (persecution?) long ago lost that aspect with the public.  Once the argument turned from “did he do it”, to “what the hell is the crime”, the law became an “ass” as the adage goes.

            Good then they need to prosecute every candidate for any elected office from president to dog catcher going back at least a century.Suddenly unenforced “laws” against any previous presidential candidate in U.S. history just have to be enforced right here, right now, to “save our democracy.”Or in this case jackass laws enforced that don’t even exist on the books to politically persecute one parties enemy.Trump paid a lawyer to handle his shit. If the lawyer fucked up, you prosecute the lawyer.Said lawyer was also stealing money from his client.Laws my ass!

            Is that a joke? Even the judge, let alone the prosecutors, have not even said what the crime is. And if we’re going to “respect the law,” shouldn’t we go back and pick up hillary, comey, weismann, mueller, and all the rest first? Awfully convenient having the “we must respect the law” attitude come up just as PDT is tried by a DOJ member who quit his job in DC and moved to NYC to assist Bragg and James, but not before.

                If I heard correctly, the judge instructed to jury that they need not know what the specific crime is to convict.  I’ve stopped following basically.  At a certain point, you just give up trying to fit a rationale explanation to this legal farce to save your last vestige of faith in the judicial system of the country.
