        In 2017, if that dopey woman “pastor” gave that “sermon” (which was just a MSNBC screed), she would have been paraded in the media for months as the bravest person who ever lived. And sure she got some press in the progressive sphere but people mostly rolled their eyes and laughed at her. We’re all sick of hearing this stuff and it doesn’t work anymore. These people had their chance to remake the country in their image for the past 15 years or so, and it turns out we do not want what they are selling and it is our right to refuse it.

                ‘I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man’ (1 Timothy 2:11)Can’t say you weren’t told.  Scripture affirms unambiguously that females are not to teach men.  Further, women are not allowed to assume ANY type of authority over a man.No woman-pastors.  No women teachers.  No women supervisors.  No girlbosses.  No women judges.  No women cops.  No household Disney Princesses, because that’s the generational lifeblood of Feminism. No queens (Once-Great Britain, I’m looking at you.  You asked for it and you’re getting it).Conservative and Christian men believe that females are superior morally and spiritually to males.  How do I know?  Because I talk to them almost every day.  They parrot their conditioning from movies and teevee.  Again, Scripture refutes this pedestalized superiority utterly and repeatedly.Christian and conservative parents send their daughters to college to obtain credentialed careers (Don’t Need No Man) and to learn how to despise maleness, whiteness, etc. . . . to professionalize their superiority over males, essentially, to reject the Bible, and to spit in God’s face.  Now women are around 70% of the student body.

                            Christcucks always,always go after white countries.
England/Britain/UK had constitutional monarchs some who were women.
Russia had queens and empresses;as did Spain.Then again Russia is a toilet.
America has gotten it,is getting it, and will continue to get it at a turbo pace thanks to Trump. Don’t blame women for the next chapter of dissolution.

                    Timothy doesn’t go as far as no women in secular government. Paul is pretty laser focused on the Church in his letters to Timothy.That said, women as political leaders is a pretty clear Biblical curse. One of the few female leaders who the Israelites had (Deborah) was ashamed for the guys who asked to lead.

                    Of course a Catholic implies English girls deserve to be raped by Pakistanis.Maybe those rape gangs are a vehicle for your god’s vengeance?I bet ,when you read about all those rapes, it made your day.Does that mean your Pope is right when he says the real problem is when victims of paedos speak up, rather than the raping?
Been to France and the UK and I gotta say France is closer to the abyss.Hopefully they never vote for Marine Le Pen and keep voting for Macron or maybe Melenchon!

                “1 Corinthians 14:34-35 (NIV):Women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says. If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.”This is how you know what church/denomination/ministry has fallen into error (taken position against the very Biblical teachings they claim to follow). Unfortunately that seems to include many (most?) Protestant denominations. Trump, who is a Christian in name only, should/would have known this and never attended such an assembly.

                        No, but the truth has intrinsic value.  Trump is not a Christian and  does not know the Bible and its teachings.  Therefore he is an easy mark for those charlatans who do and those who practice such false teachings.  He is defenseless against those people, when it would be easy to defeat them on their own terms.

“Sir Arthur St. Clare, as I have already said, was a man who read his Bible. That was what was the matter with him. When will people understand that it is useless for a man to read his Bible unless he also reads everybody else’s Bible? A printer reads a Bible for misprints. A Mormon reads his Bible, and finds polygamy; a Christian Scientist reads his, and finds we have no arms and legs.”

                        There are many things in which Donald need not be perfect, but this is not one of them.
Trump is a CINO.  America is either a Christian nation, or a feminist and woke nation.  Scriptural Christianity is the foundation of a nation, as it receives God’s favor.
A president who is a REAL Christian, and guided by Scripture, is non-negotiable.  Because anything else will fail.

                            I’m not so sure. The only recent President who was (maybe) a “real” Christian was GW Bush. That didn’t exactly give him the best decision making skills. The value of traditional faith for those of us who are skeptical about the specific spiritual claims it makes, is that it hews more closely to the realities of the human condition than modern secular liberalism, not to mention things like Marxist utopianism.It’s ironic that if you start with a purely secular mindset, based in evolutionary psychology and an understanding of the fact that existing races have evolved in isolation for quite a long time, you get an understanding that isn’t very far from that of the Bible. This is especially the case in understanding (proper) roles of women and the division of labor by sex.There are plenty of real, devout Christians, especially women, who should never be allowed to make decisions about things like border control or immigration. There are also plenty of “based” atheists who could be relied on to make the right choices. Granted, the few based non-believers seem to have dropped off the radar. In fact I’ve noticed that the more outspoken a person is about their unbelief, the likelier they are to suffer from extreme TDS.

                            There are many things in which Donald need not be perfect, but this is not one of them.
As much as I’d like for America to be governed by a Catholic warrior-king in the vein of Louis IX, that’s just not in the cards right now. Best to work with what we have at hand, and Trump represents a major improvement over his predecessors. More devout men will follow.

Any real Christian would never invite that woman, who is the express enemy of God and nation, to attend.‘This is how you know what church/denomination/ministry has fallen into error’Yep, that’s an excellent litmus test.Donald is lost spiritually, as indicated long ago with his embrace of a New Age witch — Paula White, an ‘apostalic leader’ — as his Spiritual Advisor. Somebody his daughter would just luuurve!That’s as lost as lost gets. To date, Donald is a creature of the surrounding culture. He does not know his Father.

What I worry more about is women as invasive species. Once something becomes x percent female, the men run away

All the more reason to keep them ALL out. This kind of kudzu-like invasive feminization is particularly destructive in places like science and technology where brilliant men are driven off to make room for mediocre women.

                        Alas, feminism was only one, and probably a lesser reason for women in the workforce. Sometime in the 60s, men decided that they needed–or wanted–a second income. At that point, the prohibitions against women working attenuated, women began to enter the workforce in increasing numbers, and 70s feminism accelerated the process. And seeing as how most households in the West have become dependent on two incomes, it is difficult to see how we can put that particulardjinnback in the bottle.

                                Problem is that in order to put sufficient pressure to pay men 2.25x current wages, you need men willing to stop working for 1.0x wages.
Do you believe there are many men who would do that?
Or can that maybe be only approached from the other side? Bring cost of living down to where one guy’s income is enough for a family?

                    I made a “notebook observation” back in ’95 that once an office workspace becomes greater than 25% female, the “tone of everything chages”, and NOT for the better. I stand by that observation, and as an aside, can you find me a white-collar ocupation in AD 2025 that is less than 50% skirts?(It’s be a shame to keep female orgaizational talent out completely,  but, things being what they are…)

            Paul banned women as leaders if the early Church, and the Bible specifically warned against being led by women…Apparently, their shortcomings as leaders, both secular and spiritual, have been visible for millennia…And the left is almost entirely a feminist movement, which started with Carrie Nation and her followers, who sought not only the vote for women, but abolition of alcohol, and socialism…All quite successfully, but proving disastrous for the American nation….

                Obviously, the entire thing was ridiculous and feels like a setup – and Trump seems to have caught on to that. It happened quite a bit in the first term.
This is where I do wish Trump was a more religious man. How effective would it have been if he went out there and said this, thus undermining any spiritual authority that this “pastor” claims to have and wield over him.

                    Exactly.  He should have stood up and left the assembly.  He could have taken a middle ground and simply said that the “minister” had forgotten her spiritual duty’s in favor of political activism.  No conservative religionists would have taken affront—and the other would have been put on notice.

Wrong response.  Her immediate excommunication from the church and shunning would have been a much better response.   In a better time, she’d have been charged as a witch.

I appreciate the sentiment but this has not been keeping track of the Anglican church in the 20th century. They “ordained” her.

            Past 20, 25 years maybe?The hell of progressivism is that eventually you WILL get mugged by reality. Were a few swirls further down the progressive toilet than America is in Canada and the wheels are coming off. People no longer have a choice.The first 10 or 15 years of the progressive age were great in Canada. Canadians LIVE freak shows and the queers, vibrant, and clowns were happy to perform. It’s easy to make fun and laugh while Darwin and Murphy have sport with others… but if it goes long enough everyone else will get sucked into that swirling vortex. Suddenly YOUR pastor is a retarded lesbian. YOUR kid has a pedo for a teacher. Or he comes home wanting a sex change. Or the neighborhood Somalians eat YOUR cat or rape YOUR wife. OR retarded queer fire chiefs look around stupidly when there’s no water in the fire hydrant…and YOUR house burns down.Eventually you have to do something about those people or they will do something to you.

        Off topic– So I actually wrote this post last night but decided to save it for today. But I was so disturbed last night it had to come out, so here we go. This place (the US) is cooked. Even if Trump deported a -million- illegals this year, and he won’t come even close to that, the die is already cast. The horse is out of the barn, whatever analogy you prefer. We’d need at least 5 million a year for the next 4 years to even come close to reversing and they simply don’t have the will or the manpower for it.DC Area USA “Field Report” 1/26/26I’m leaving for Europe again in a week so I had to go out and do some shopping prior to traveling as I’m going to be gone MUCH longer this time (Thank you Jesus!). I went to some outlet stores that are way out of the DC area in the hinterlands because I was visiting someone that lived near there. Clarksburg Outlets, this is literal bumf-ck way out at the very upper edge of Montgomery County, MD. Way out in the sticks but it doesn’t matter anymore.The mall looked like an international bazaar in some unknown country. The Star Wars Cantina basically. A sea of mud as far as I could see, a collage of various shades of brown and black faces. I drove across the US 2 years ago and saw all the little mud goblins all across the USA in the in-between places, not just major cities but way out in the ‘burbs even in “flyover country” but occasionally I forgot and have to get the grim reminder by actually going somewhere, anywhere, and seeing it again. If you factor the “uncounted” illegals which know is deep into the tens of millions we are probably White minority already. Especially if you subtract middle easterners who for whatever bizarre reason are labeled “white” on the US Census.I carefully surveyed the crowd as I did my loop around this entire large outdoor outlet mall. 85% mystery meat, 15% white at -best-. Again, this is in the middle of nowhere, Maryland. Spanish, African languages, middle Eastern languages, strange accents, very little English.In a week I’m going to “foreign countries” and I have never felt more in a foreign country anywhere over there than I did at that mall today. And this happened before in the summer before I went last time. That time in Northern VA at Springfield Mall. Same situation 75% goblinas, blacks, Indians, smattering of Asians and a tiny handful of white people. As I said in the opening this place is cooked. I can’t WAIT to get on that plane next week and get out of this multi-culti sewer. Trump is a band-aid on a hemorrhaging sucking chest wound basically.I feel so on edge when I’m out around this degenerated genetic slurry of brown mutts. Alien look, alien languages, alien culture, alien faces many of which are constantly scowling. What country is this? The USA I remember is LONG gone. It normally takes me weeks to see a black face when I’m abroad in the South and East of Europe. I saw hundreds in a single day a sea of them and had to hunt for the white faces in the brown tide.

            “We’d need at least 5 million a year for the next 4 years to even come close to reversing and they simply don’t have the will or the manpower for it.”Exactly.  It can’t be done.  Same situation wrt Climate Change.  Solution—mitigate damage.  Sour the milk for illegals.  Kill job’s, destroy welfare for IA’s, prevent political involvement.  Offer incentives for “voluntary” repatriation.  Deport immediately all who run afoul of the law.This of course may well be impossible as the reason IA’s were admitted in the first place is that they were desired by TPTB and served their purposes.  Nonetheless, this effort being made is better than attempting to ferret out IA’s one by one.  The incidents of damage will pile up until the opposition rises in ascendency.

            Yep. Got off the Interstate to get gas in Ogallala, Nebraska fourteen years ago and there were a bunch of coal-black Africans of some kind walking down the street. And Ogallala is the most dusty, roughneck, stereotypically-Western mud-and-cow-piss town I have ever personally seen.
I hear there are Somalis in Grand Island, too…

                20 years ago when I was at my freshman orientation at Nebraska-Lincoln I remember mentioning to my dad in the car about how there were barely any minorities in this city (part of the allure for me, even back then).  At that moment, we just so happened to pass the state penitentiary to which I exclaimed “OH, there they are!”

            Apex – Good luck and God speed.   Expect the usual denials and ‘black piller’ labels in response.  People here are too busy celebrating the ‘winning’ of a dyke Coast Guard head getting sh*t canned, while ignoring all the other womyn and degenerates she’s seeded the ranks with in the past few years.  My husband sees the same demographic dregs as you when he must make his business trips.  We are blessed to live in a heritage White town/county, but we don’t pretend it’s anything more than a fading remnant of the America we grew up in.  People would much rather focus on politics (and push devout Hindu Usha Vance as the next ‘First Lady’) than face the reality of AINO’s population being perhaps 50% White at present and shrinking fast. Deporting a few thousand -even a few hundred thousand – mestizos and blacks won’t change that reality that most Whites still deny. They just don’t even see it anymore because it’s the sea in which they’ve swum for decades now.

            Glad you found a new home. Have to say that I agree. It’s nice what’s going on with Trump, but it’s too late to save the country as a whole. We’ll see if we can carve something out, but if you’re in the right stage of life, it’s probably best to try and find a new country.

                This country has been dog-eat-dog for some time. At least now I get to see the fear in the eyes of the local ‘immigrants’ that only a few weeks ago strutted around toting their Friday Modelo like they owned my town.Where I live 50% of whytes are liberals, and they took the bait so deep, there is no getting the hook out of their gullet. One, a recent big city transplant to my small town put a ‘black’ patch’ on his Faceberg page on Inaugration Day – guy is 59, just started a new job at local uni and this is what he does.What a hero.I have another lib ‘friend’ that just won’t get the memo and buzz off. Sold his $1 million+ home, moved to the usual southern place where those that ‘hate the cold’ congregate … typical affluent, is what I consider illiterate, by actions — CAN read never does … IT guy, couldn’t place the Civil War by century but SURE has TDS to the max …. super jab, skinny shitlib bride they spout all the shibboleths as if everyone agrees with them. But say ONE thing against their MSNBC narrative and they are … well trigger alert. Guy piped up about “QANON” the other day .. I mean … really.Except telling them to JUST FUCK OFF … they have no idea. Not in the mood to seed these kind of people (met in biz circles) …. ‘hey I got to go’ when they feel the need to reach out is the basic plan.My point is we have to be for our own, and that transcends race, not on boomer terms, but real terms – being “whyte” does not mean shit on its own.

                    One of the many things I despise about s***libs is they always just assume everyone thinks the same as they do and always feel free to blab their TDS and obnoxious opinions to whomever they’re speaking with.

                        It is seriously a weird defect on their part. An overall sign of their defective status — they blurt whatever trope enters their minds … as if the state-approved propaganda is THE WRIT.What I have noticed with most of them is if you mildly push back with some ‘wrongthink’ but they have not put you in the category of ‘bad orangeman supporter’ — say your shitlib neighbor you help jump start cars, simple things like that that shitlib wimp males cannot undertake — they say nothing, purse lips with a blank look on face …. then when the wrongthink has faded, respond to whatever ‘look, a squirrel’ comment you make to walk them out of their fugue. No retort usually, and if they do offer up something, it is an effort to not burst out laughing as they magpie something ‘as seen on TV.’It really is bizarro world.

                There will be carve-outs. We see that shaping up now. They also will be under constant siege, at least initially. Some European nations will survivequanations. I suspect much of the censorship was and is aimed at keeping Euros from seeing what unfolds in North America. If someone is young enough and without enough life constraints, what Apex has done is the rational choice.

        ‘It is why modern progressivism is so thuggish. Without a Bible to hold up as his authority, the modern progressive has only her fist to shake at the crowd. Since she is on the right side of history, she is the white hat, so anyone in opposition must be the black hat and against the black hat, you must use any means necessary’Modern progressivism or Woke is thuggish (and totalitarian) because it is a female inspired and female dominated movement . . . in truth, a religion that already has replaced Christianity in America and much of the West.  It persists because Woke’s opposition refuse to face that fact.Neither people nor governments will cop to this.  They pretend females do not inhabit a supremacist position in their nations — despite overwhelming evidence otherwise — and thus the nations are over-run by the Religion of Women, which is what Woke really is, an endless empowering of females and disempowering and demeaning of males. . . even of masculinity itself.  The Prot denominations largely have been conquered and are now under the power of Progressivism, which is to say, under the power of women.Folks want to believe that Woke is on the decline, that Woke is over, that Donald Trump will finish off Woke.  This is absurd because the central characteristic of Woke — the cultural and legal supremacy of collective female power — has not even been addressed and admitted, much less conquered.Trump is an Eighties-era liberal with a feminist daughter, who in four years as president didn’t even acknowledge the truth, much less oppose the feminism that rules all your institutions and slaughters your children out of personal convenience.  Thus you declare victory in a war that has yet to be fought.

            Very well said.  Not only the truth about women, but that everyone is busy declaring victory in a war that has yet to be fought.  Trump may officially ‘cancel’ government sponsorship of DIE, but neither he nor his accolytes have nor will address the inherent and innate differences and inequality among the races and between the sexes.  Cancelling symptoms/cutting off a head or two does not kill the Hydra.

                3g, rayj, or Compsci, do you have an explanation about how such obvious prohibitions on homosexuality and female leadership are so blithely ignored by most Christians? How are these obvious violations of Scripture embraced by most Christians?
My explanation is that the media and the people who own it have an unprecedented power to dictate our morality due to their ubiquity.  No people have encountered this totality of mass media before.

                    Line:  People are stupid and easily led – period.  Full stop.  They want the easy answer and easy solutions.  They don’t want to have to work – let alone hurt anyone’s feelings – to effect lasting change.  E.g. see the thousands of comments telling all the mestizos and blacks to come back ‘legally’ and all will be just fine.  Churchianity is no different and is feminized to the core.

                        The feminized route is the smoothest route. Most people go along with the crowd because that intuits safety. Men are less susceptible to the herd stampede, yet still quite vulnerable and weak, as our times illustrate.

                    Dispensationalism. Pretty much all sects are so insistent on distancing themselves from the OT, the Law and the prophets that He referred to, that they are suckers for the God of Love and similar Marcionite tripe. If one buys into dispensations it’s not much of a reach to go from “OT Law doesn’t apply because it’s old” to “Pauline restatement of OT Law doesn’t apply because it’s old.”

                        You are so right. They don’t like what the OT says, so they pretend it’s been superseded by the NT or annulled by Christ. Which is not the case.
I’m an OT person although I recognize the superiority and inevitability of Christ’s ways — the Kingdom of the Father, the Kingdom of Love. Guess you could say I’m getting phased-out.

                                    Look up what Jesus said about divorce.  Remarriage is (generally) an adulterous act which it was not under the Mosaic Law. Christ seems to revert the Law here. For sure, he’s changing it without any appeal beyond Himself.Who was telling Peter he had the authority to change the Mosaic Law? Peter acted in the Church era, where the authority of the Father flowed through the Son and the Son bestowed it on Peter, at least when we’re talking about the area the practice of the religion and explanation of faith/morals.That’s why we can’t choose from the OT at random/from personal preference. Jesus set up a system to let us know what He wanted through a covenant.

                    I think as Ray stated that our “Christianity” has become feminized and therefore subverted.  We have been told repeatedly to be “non-judgmental”, accepting, forgiving, and to “turn the other cheek” to the point of tolerance of *evil* within our midst.
Not all sects and branches are this poz’d—yet.  Of course, you are correct wrt to the media which once themselves infected served to spread and enforce the infection, but what was the disease?  That is the question.

                    “How are these obvious violations of Scripture embraced by most Christians?”This is will be unpopular with the Protestants on the board, but from my view, it’s the logical conclusion of the right of private interpretation. Early Protestantism parallels the Catholic faith* in many ways.   As Protestantism carries on in the next 500 years, stranger and stranger groups appear. Their ideas drift father from the Catholic faith as everyone gets a hold of a Bible and decides for themselves what it must mean.I can find Christian groups that think God hates alcohol consumption, when the NT is quite clear it’s fine. (And I think the OT even has a passage making fun of people who preach no alcohol.) That’s just scratching the surface of all sorts of topics.There’s no particularly solving that problem of every man and his Bible. Yes, mass media absolutely doesn’t help. Certainly the Jews successfully scrubbed God altogether from the conversation. But putting God back in is not necessarily going to help.*Catholic Church does not derive it’s authority from the Scriptures she safe guards but from a covenant from Jesus with Peter and the apostles.

It goes way beyond that. In Deuteronomy 14:22ff, Moses lays out what the tithe is. And, interestingly enough, also that the expectation of the tax for “welfare” is 3%.
(He tells you what the tithe is three times, but this is the most clearly explained.)
Let me ask you: how many homilies have you listened to in your church where the tithe has been explained according to scripture? Are you certain that the covenant has been honored?

Are you certain that the covenant has been honored?”The Mosaic Law has been fulfilled in the New Covenant. We’re in the Church era, and so the Church talks about what to give and how much. There are lots of specifics that have “expired” in the Mosaic Law in favor of guidance that belongs to the current era.Further, proper tithing in an usuaristic/wage world is a little tricky. The tithe was 10% of the increase of animals/grains/etc. That’s not the same as 10% of someone’s steady wage income. Part of the arguments against interest in Christianity involve that money does not increase in the way that farms/fields do and that expecting interest was unnatural.To your specific question, most priests hate talking about money and it’s mostly saved for Lenten BAA or very specific capital campaigns. Someone could attend Mass most of the year and not hear about money.

IME, most priests are perfectly happy lecturing about Malachai 3 and a few (out of context) verses in the NT, but I have heard exactly none talk about what Moses said about it.
Why is that? Why do they only talk about giving to the church, and therefore, them, rather than what Moses says tithing is all about?

                                    What I discussed is  not dispensationalism, which is busy carving up the NT and specifically Jesus to apply to different groups.I have no idea where your personal idea of what priests give homilies about is coming from. The Catholic Church in the Roman Rite works under 3 year lectionary. The vast majority of the Bible is proclaimed in 3 year cycle. Every Sunday Mass includes an OT reading, Psalms, an NT reading, and a Gospel reading for which we stand.  Protestant pastors can recycle the same sermons to their hearts content. Catholic priests have to deal with this week’s readings, which they could only recycle from 3 years ago. The lectionary cycle is why many regular attendance Catholics even by accident are far more familiar with the New Testament and the Gospels than some Protestants.Moses said a lot of things about dietary practices, clothing, personal hygiene, and seeking out Levitical priests in a moment of sin. Picking the tithe in very complete books is a strange moment. And as I said, this is the Church era, which replaces the parts of the Mosaic Law with religious customs that are impossible to recreate anyway. Unless you’re walking up to your pastor with the first best lamb of the season, it’s not the Mosaic law as originally penned.

                                        You have no idea what dispensationalism is, do you? The Catholic church uses the term “dispensation” a little differently, more of a relaxation of the rules.The generally recognized dispensations are the Edenic Covenant, the Adamic covenant, the Noahic Covenant, the Abrahamic Covenant, the Mosaic Covenant, and what you are calling the Church Age. Most obviously are OT.Dispensationalists believe that God changed His mind and changed the rules of what it meant to be living a Godly life. Which is balderdash. Since He is perfect, all His decrees are perfect. Changing the rules would either mean His prior rules were not perfect, or He is changing things to imperfect law.If the Covenants appear to conflict, like you are doing with the Church Age, it’s because man can’t understand how to reconcile how those “dispensations” are not rule changes. And, frankly, there’s a lot of wishful thinking mixed in, that God approves of certain human political positions.

                    Howdy LITS:‘How are these obvious violations of Scripture embraced by most Christians?’Human beings are fallen and weak.  Most prefer the easy road.  These particular violations reach to the beginnings of humanity.  Because the violations never have been overcome, they continue to operate and metastasize all down the line of generations.This world became cursed with suffering, death, and entropy because it was discovered that those violations existed in the primal man and woman.The woman rebelled against God via covetousness and the will-to-power.  Are these not at the very core of both empowerment-feminism and modern mercantile culture?The man co-rebelled by ‘listening to (obeying) the voice of the woman’ INSTEAD of listening to (obeying) the voice of God.  In effect, he chose the female as his god(dess), his object of worship and obedience.  The gyno cults are the oldest on record (see James Frazer and J.J. Bachofen).God, having been rejected by His own Creation, said ‘Ok I’m outta here’ and left us to go Burger King and have everything our own way. When the real King showed up, most everybody rejected him and indeed, called for his death.So all across the land when we see women rebelling against Scripture and taking over the churches — and men going along with it and calling it ‘good’ and ‘Biblical’ — we see ancient history as replicant.  The same error, fracturing into infinite shards, all of them wrong.  Nothing new under the sun.As for the homos, they team up with women whenever it’s convenient for both.  The reign of Jezebel and her eunuchs exemplifies this perennial team.

                        I think the story of the woman at the well has a lot more to it than most recognize.
Yes, the woman had lain with six different men, but the obvious implication was that there were five males guilty of adultery.
Samaritans, yeah, I guess. But the story does not dwell on the sin, bur rather on the redemption.

            Your observations are correct, but you are not taking into account that, while their misandrist animus is ALWAYS “there,” these XX’s are NEVER (well, with very rare exception) down for a “fight to the finish.”We know what they’re like when “theirs is ‘the whip hand&#x27;”, and shame on us for empowering them.  But (figuratively speaking!), a light tap in the eye socket followed by a love-tap on the sternum, and suddenly it’s “why are you always mean to me! That’s not MY whip…and if it is… YOU made me pick it up and use it!”Have faith, mein bruder!

        We can only hope the demon of secular progressivism is being excised.  Maybe White anglos were already on their way down this road as the 20th century dawned, but Jews entering the elite surely turbocharged progressive politics.  It’s pretty much been a mounting disaster ever since.

            Z put it best as “but the authority for them simply disappeared”.  In the U.S. at least, Progressivism relied on the structure of Christianity as a basis for their claims.  As late as several years ago they’d try to turn ideological debates into religious debates, but the result was just hollowing out the religious claims to their cause.  Now when they say “well Jesus wouldn’t want you to do that” the response is “don’t care”.  And it’s not necessarily that they “don’t care” about Jesus, just that they don’t care what someone else says about him.

        When progressives took over puritanism but dropped Christianity, they removed the limiting principle that kept those who ruled in the name of God from complete tyranny.  Jesus boiled down the entirety of God’s teachings into two rules: love God and love your neighbor as yourself.  If you try to follow those rules, you can still rationalize a lot of bad behavior, but it has limits. Progressives are unbound by limits. This brings us to C. S. Lewis:“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victim may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron’s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated, but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.”

            Lewis was a serious writer who meant his words. The one everyone overlooks in that quote is “sincerely.”

So the quote has never been apposite. No political actor seeks the good. Rationalizations are not “sincere.” Means are ends. Rule is its own purpose.

        The unspoken predicate of Progressive beliefs is that the Government, the proposed main instrument of collective “salvation”, is actually competent and can deliver against promises. The crisis of Progressivism isn’t so much the ridiculousness of the ideas – because people will obviously believe any BS – as it is the abject failure of Government to deliver better standards of living in recent years. It’s possible people are rejecting the instrument and working backwards towards questioning and rejecting the stupid ideas.

            In my lifetime, progressivism shifted from addressing the material needs of the poor to addressing the spiritual needs of single females, the mentally ill and social deviants. Note that their concerns about racism are not tethered to the alleged practical impact of racism. It is about the spiritual crisis allegedly caused by racism. There is no practical program to progressivism now.I think this is why Obama Care was such a mess. The joyous supporters of Obama did not care about health care reform in a practical sense. It was just another symbol indicating that he was the messiah. That is not how you get reformed through Congress. The result made healthcare worse, but they celebrated it anyway because practical issues no longer matter to them.Progressivism, fully free of practical concerns, first celebrated the coming of their messiah, then when he was not the messiah, it turned into a burning hatred of present reality that has now burned itself out.

                            I think Trump gave the answer – “Business of America is Business”. To Trump, everything is real estate. Greenland is a terrific property. Gaza needs to be evacuated so that it is built to its (real estate) potential.

                            Spot on! Who Are We is the question before us. We, Americans, acknowledge and have put it front and center. Trump and the techno-optimists are mercantilists and machinists. They avoid the question but it is answered. For them the answer is: Business owners, financiers and employees. Don’t forget consumers.In the past 25 years the answer who are the consumers has been, eyeballs on screens, the people buying them as packaged data, retail stock market investors and imported consumers/GDP.The techno-optimists are being very clear. The consumer is the US government in the form of military technology.I think everyone abandoned the USS Femocratz because the financial and imperial of the US is probably far far worse than we know. The GAE had/has a terrible hand.This is a desperate attempt to catch up and do some reforms as the GAE beats a retreat back to its hemisphere.In any case, Who Are We is the big question. Right now, the best we can do is affirm that amongst ourselves as Heritage Americans. We Are Americans. Then the emerging battle is within the GOP between us and the techno-optimists. In the long run, they will have to answer that question.

                            To do so seems almost a bridge too far at this point. Can we really imagine Trump declaring that Americans are people of geographically European and genetically Indo-European descent? Can we imagine the paroxysms of Leftists and non-whites? Right now, AINO is not ready to hear this truth. It probably never will be.

                                I still stand by that if we’re going to hang onto “Indo-European” that it’s only a matter of time before another Vivek will be leading us into our “shared” future based on our “shared” history. Genetically Indo-European will absolutely include giving green cards to all the h1-B visa holders and massive apologies that it took so long.I don’t think it’s that hard to come up with the genetics of what American means. But it will involve everyone facing what it means to be the children of English, Italians, Scots, etc.

                                        This.  I do not consider genetics to over rule culture.  And wrt Indians (with a dot), the current science tells us India is not *one* people—genetically—but many people.
This simple fact provides an answer to why a country with an average IQ estimated at 82 can design their own modern jet air craft and build nukes.

                        “Maybe that works in the short run.”
It always works—in the short run.  Nature abhors a vacuum.  The question is, for me anyway, which do I want of the two choices.  I’ve rejected the first and look forward to the second—whatever form that takes—even if it signals that the “end” is nigh.

                        Vivek’s the id of the administration, blurting out the real meaning behind every good-seeming happening. He skulked back onto Twitter a few days ago to triumphally proclaim that Trump’s anti-DEI moves signify the end ofnarratives of racial grievance. (That’s an approximate quote; Twitter is unsearchable if you haven’t doxxed yourself to Elon.)In other words, you’re no longer allowed to complain,white boy. The great national meritocracy has arrived. The “facts on the ground”—e.g., 6% of new hires in the last five years—are nowrighteous. Complaints go in the waste basket labeled “woke right.”Here’s the new nationalism: Domestic repression will speak libertarian. The libs have been practicing for it: “It’s a private company,” etc. And all that “white rage” battlespace prep in intelligence and the military won’t go to waste. The white men who refuse to acknowledge the patriotic “vibe shift” are—what luck!—already on these lists.

                    The tech bros supporting Trump will most likely build a surveillance state that will dwarf even the one we have now.    That can only benefit the managerial state.   Couple that with digital currency and very little freedom will be left no matter that they call it “Nationalism.”

                        It is a legitimate concern. Ultimately, Trump and MAGA might be more likely to make mass arrests of us. It will depend on whether a full transition can be made to “who,” with us as “who.” That’s quite possible, too, but the suppression of white identity is schedule to be in the hands of a Pajeet as things stand.

Yet this intent was so easily subverted and defeated.  Why?
It seems like many whites have a desire to transcend race and to imagine that everyone else feels the same.

Now, yes—but in the recent past? As short as 100 years ago we had bloody race riots in Northern cities. 60 years ago we still had segregation. Something changed from the early American Founding Stock and today? What?
Spiteful Mutants and general prosperity (affluence) unknown in the historical record. In short, genetic decline caused by easy living. The (White) species was never evolved for those conditions.

                                    At the same time as the newly college-educated females of the founding stock were agitating for progressive policies, i. e. Prohibition and Woman Suffrage. The country then got both, good and hard, and the 17th Amendment directly electing each state’s US Senators, pretty much eliminated the authority of the state legislatures. I’d start the ball rolling to repeal the 17th before worrying about the 19th (Woman Suffrage, as it used to be called). Also, the country during the 1st quarter of the 20th c.allowed itself to become embroiled in the awful European WWI, with equally awful President Woodrow Wilson mucking things up at home and abroad during those years.

Many Europeans don’t want to face their parents. We have become disconnected from our greater family ties, including founding stock. It’s nicer to come up with parents that were better than ours.

                        Cohesion, my azz. What kind of “culture” allows a dictator (Mao T’se Tung and a few others) to murder millions of their own people who disagreed with their political policies? There will probably also be a similar ugly reckoning should Mainland China gain a foothold on Taiwan.

                        Agree. The Left is correct. America First is whites pushing back. The identity politics/anti-white tide was finally getting whites to get off the couch but since whites still have a tough time thinking of themselves as a people, the colorblind CivNat America First was what they latched onto instead.But you can see the white identity politics bubbling up everywhere with America First. The H1B dust up showed that whites weren’t going to go along with being swamped by “legal” immigrants, especially Indians.So, yes, America First is a colorblind CivNat release valve to keep whites from joining the identity politics game, but it’s also allowing whites to say things that they’ve never felt comfortable saying before and to hear things that they’ve never heard before.And once you start going down that path, it’s tough to stop.

                    “But what comes next?”
If white Americans won’t accept that they are a group among competing groups, is it next-best good strategy to aim for colorblind meritocracy? Will that goal buy us time or further mislead us about the real issues of sovereignty?
If we refuse to have an identity, are there any other strategic options besides colorblind meritocracy?

                        Colorblind meritocracy should be more than sufficient. There’s a reason whites created such an objectively great culture and why our science and technology was the envy of the world.
Just embrace freedom of association. We will rebuild our society, and others will build the crappy cultures they came from. For better or worse, we will also see if the prog tech bois can build something out of pajeets.

                            Which is why meritocracy can never be allowed to become once again the “law of the land”. It a multi-racial society such cannot be allowed as it is proof of inherent and immutable differences among the races. In every country where mixed races exist, and one race outcompetes the other, violence/conflict is the norm. Where the superior race is in the minority, genocide is the eventual result.We (Whites) are quickly becoming a minority.A book for your perusal:  “The Geometry of Genocide” by Bradley Campbell.  Oddly enough, I suspect it will teach few people here anything they don’t already know or sense.

                            “Colorblind meritocracy” reveals inherentracial differences in intelligence but denies the genetic basis of culture and smothers genuine ethic nationalism and communities.  That is the world Steve Sailer advocates –  a theoretical United Nations Hilton resort, instead of the current Patel motel.  A thousand times NO NO NO NO NO NO.

                                I believe you misunderstand. The consequent flip side of freedom of association is freedom of dissociation. I tried to get through a Sailor piece once, but he embeds so many assumptions into his stuff, and I wonder if he even realizes it.
Whatever you mean by UN Hilton Resort, no I don’t think that’s what freedom of association means. It starts with “Get off my lawn!” and goes through “Get the hell out of my neighborhood before I shoot you” and, eventually, kicking out everyone who is not compatible with society. IYKWIMAITYD.

                You can see this most clearly with big city governments now, where the government exists to protect deviants, bums, junkies, perverts, and criminals against normal people. The progressives see the dregs of society as their weapon against normalcy. And of course, this isn’t anything new – Bio-Leninism is a thing, anarcho-tyranny is a thing. Yet, it is interesting how clear and obvious the program has become in the past five years or so, particularly since COVID and the Floyd riots.When it came to Obamacare, the progressives were quite happy to make health insurance worse and more expensive for normal people.

                    Big city governments are SOL. Many if not most are nearly insolvent, and federal sugar is very dicey now. Note that when Trump went to LA he demanded that fire recovery be tied to the end of mail-in balloting. It is likely bluster but that’s where things are going. As a matter of fact, that was my biggest white pill of late. More than ever people need to get out of the cities because as we have seen repeatedly they prefer collapse and ruin to prosperity, and that’s about to be dialed up to 11.

                    it’s also the fact that the big cities act as “safe houses” of sorts. Like the DDC (federal district court for the district of columbia) is basically a free for all. No democrat is going to get convicted of anything there and no republican is going to get acquitted of anything either. The judges are all basically dem operatives.

                Right. Modern progressivism is basically female narcissism. It’s not about accomplishing anything tangible — health care, pensions, housing, higher standard of living, etc. — it’s about the dopamine high of claiming moral one-upmanship (one-up-personship?) over the bigoted Evil White Racist Males.
So what if Los Angeles burns? It has it’s first Lesbian Fire Commissioner, and it’s first Woman of Color Mayor.
That’s all that matters.

                    Yes Xman. I would argue that the manifest incompetence gives normal people lots of reasons to question the “moral” propositions of Progressivism. If they could put out actual fires, people might cut them more slack. The moral order of our ancestors got traction in large measure because people could see the real-world benefits – societal cohesion, long-range planning etc.

                    It isn’t that rational. Think of Luigi as this era’s Charles Manson. Eventually Clouds realized that Manson’s ascendance posed a threat so he was marginalized and memoryholed as much as possible (“he’s a racist!” had started its run). The people, mostly women, who idolize Luigi are emotionally incontinent and are drawn to the bad boy.

                        The women of the left are squirming in their seats for the pretty boy killer, but the men among them who aren’t mere Democrats (their smart fraction) have a saner view, shared by many of us who were already regarded as part of the “rising threat of domestic terrorism”: Events like this have been made necessary.The bad guys are framing the latter  group as a subset of the former, always using the phrase “support Luigi,” to discredit the observation/attitude—and they seem to believe their own propaganda. In the first few weeks, feds wentwild“you won’t do shit”-posting with Luigi memes, thinking we can be groomed into criminality via cult of personality.Idiot dystopia is idiots.

                as someone who still shares a lot of liberal beliefs but is also cynical, I view politics as a mix between a video game and also supporting the sports team (i.e. being a red sox fan). I sort of have a paranoia about the TV/movie villain like Doug Neidermeyer or Greg Marmalard taking over and while I dislike wokeness, I dislike it mainly because I feel it will empower people I imagine to be the embodiment of those two characters.
Anything about healthcare, infrastructure and all that is just secondary.

        Interesting. I don’t think we are finished with progressivism. I think there is another strain that infects the techno-optimists. They are self-described progressives. Their entire project is defined by progress. Perhaps we are witnessing the death of social progressivism. Even then, there are mass numbers of those faithful hanging around. In a world where technical progressivism has seized the reins, what happens to them when they have no cognitive ability to take a place in a technical progressive world?Can you banish social progressivism? Now, I have an answer to this. This is where mass deportation enters. Most of the work and income that social progressivism created was make work and wealth consuming. As the social progressives originally understood, we have a duty to the well being of our less fortunate. So, them being less fortunate, they will do the jobs that for nearly 6 decades they have been paid not to do.The second leg of this plan is to do what Reagan/Clinton/Bush/Obama should have done if they were going to outsource. That is to create efficient training programs sponsored by industry that help Americans transition to the next phase of an advanced technological industrial society. Part of that is dispossessing the Pajeets of their subsidized hotel and gas station businesses and sending them home. Those assets will be auctioned off and provided for heritage Americans to run, should they remain profitable. The same is true of the H1B visas. The coding jobs that don’t require advanced math/physics/CS skills, which is a large number of them, will be jobs that the H1B workers train their American replacements to do.Now, I haven’t gotten to technical progressivism, (Thiel, Andreesen techno-optimist crowd), yet. Their idea is equally messianic and they admit it. They must create abundance in order to eliminate competition over scarcity.What is missing from all of this is the human dimension. Techno-optimism assumes that the substrata of society just exists. Technology itself is not the substrata of society or a civilization. Family, church, kith, kin community, are. For that you have to know who you are. You have to be able to define yourself. You need a coherent, cohesive identity that emerges naturally and organically from nature, and is recognized and honed by the rational mind to augment it.It will be interesting to see how things go with the Techno-Optimists in the driver’s seat. At least they do acknowledge that spirit/God/faith are important. The divide is that you cannot have those things in a real way if you do not believe in the supernatural. The New Age belief is not a true belief because it is self-centered. It is all about manifesting the supernatural for narcissistic little self.What we do know, is that we are responsible for ourselves. We have to participate in the world and take advantage of the window of opportunity Trump and this realignment presents. Have a great week everyone. I think the New Founding tagline says it best, “Build the America You Want To Live In.”

                We are going to have to man up and take a seat at the table with them. White America is going to have to prove we are a more stable partner than black females and vengeful black urban machine hacks.As long as mRNA stuff is voluntary then fine. What we need to do is be a part of building skynet. Someone is going to control the tools of tyranny. If we master them and build them it at least is us who will be in control. You don’t want it to be Soros Jr. telling blacks how to wield it and not caring how they abuse it.There is no way around this. We have to be leaders in the future of energy, AI, robotics … … This puts us in the position to control our destiny. Anduril is opening a huge factory in Ohio as is Intel. Our job is to get ourselves and our folk and our children first in line to dominate the buildout of all of this stuff.At the same time, we position ourselves as the ultimate ruling authority by safeguarding our most important technology – the social/spiritual technology of Occidental Man. Even the tech oligarchs are starting to figure out that you can’t keep this thing going if you don’t have a social fabric that binds it all together. The progressive coalition spasms and chimp outs are going to be an opening that we need to walk through heads high and with calm to be a part of the elite and elite adjacent.

        OFF TOPIC: Zman or someone should do a deep dive of the LA fires.  This was so clearly allowed to happen, just like the Maui fires.  It was sabotage in the mask of incompetence in terms of the fire department cut budgets, the lesbians at the helm, the lack of water, the refusal for forest maintenance because of smelt-fish or some slug or whatever, etc.  I don’t know whether DEW weapons were used, but I tend to think it’s not necessary when the rest of this purposeful neglect went on.The true story of this event lays bare how the government IS THE ENEMY.  The dancing gov. Newscum is connected to mobster Pelosi, the billionaire water family Resnicks, and also the Getty family I believe.  The objective was clearly to clear out generational single-family homes for big developers to get their hands on primo beach front property.  IT IS ON PURPOSE FULL STOP.It’s parallel to how CA has spent untold billions on the “homeless” aka the bums and just attracted more druggies (and arsonists) and lost account where all that money went.  It’s a scam and it’s a war against the people.

        Z’s schema is sound, but needs a bit of elaboration. Specifically, what caused Leftists–or progressives–to abandon reason, and what was the philosophical/theoretical system that replaced it? The simple answer seems to be that the world wars were the final salvoes that demolished reason’s supremacy, although prefigurations of this phenomenon date to Nietzsche. Hence, if Western society is based on reason, and the result was the mass slaughter of WWI and WWII, of what use is reason? This question, in turn, led to abhorrence of Western colonialism/imperialism, which triggered decolonization and postcolonialism as an intellectual field of a sort.But there had to be more than a visceral revulsion toward the sanguinary and “oppressive” events of the 20th century. A system was required both to intellectually justify the abandonment of reason and to provide a framework to replace reason. What rushed into the void was poststructuralism, more commonly denoted as postmodernism. Without going into nettlesome details, this theoretical system argued that reason itself, or logocentrism, was racist, and in fact, was unreasonable. Going all the way back to Plato, Western philosophy privileged reason, and even mastery of the Greek language, while regarding non-reasoning, non-Greek speakers as barbarians.What’s more, the postmodernists contended that language itself structures peoples into discrete, incommensurable cultural groups, and that because language rather than “reality” is the dominant structure of human existence, no cultural-linguistic group has any more claim to the knowledge of truth than any other. In this argument lay the profound relativism that derogated Western civilization and elavated all non-Western cultures and civilizations. Western civilization was unhorsed.Balled up in all of this, obviously, was anti-white racism. It is pointless to try to say whether postmodernism gave rise to anti-white racism or vice versa. For all intents and purposes, they were coterminous, fed upon one another, and continue doing so today. We can hope–although I remain somewhat skeptical–that postmodern anti-white racism disintegrated before it could reach its genocidal telos. That, however, remains to be seen. It will take more than the landslide election of a Blue-Eyed Ice Devil and a raft of executive orders to prove that we have emerged on the other side of our long irrational nightmare.

            I know this isn’t your assertion, but the sequencing did not matter. Any philosophy that is anti-rational and anti-civilizational, to the degree those two can be disentangled, will be anti-white. Sure, some East Asians can be reasonable and build great things but they are outliers. Rationality and civilization are white norms. And because of the Great Replacement, we live in the ruins.

            I don’t think it’s that involved. I know you hate having everything reduced to Marx, but grab Ockham’s Razor. He took an irrational, or even anti-rational ideology and dressed it up in emotional terms. Made it an easy sell to midwits. Why are college campuses so full of progs? They are full of midwits.
And, of course, women are like a moth to flame for ideologies that emphasize their primary attribute — emotionalism.

                Compared to pomo, Marxism is quite rational. It was a fairly logical, albeit misbegotten response to the misery occasioned by the early Industrial Revolution. The emotional trappings were to sell copies of The Communist Manifesto.

                    Postmodernism is literary. That’s the basis on which it’s rejected by what’s come to be called “wokeness.”
The lesson taken from Derrida’s “White Mythology”—a lesson found nowhere in it, but its title does bait it—is:Literariness is whiteness. To produce or even acknowledge meaning in philosophical texts—in the metaphorical-speech tradition of Europe—isonlyto perpetuate whiteness. (Knowing what Derrida actually said is whiteness, too.)
The academy adopted this attitude to accommodate dumb students—to make room for diversity as it arrived—not because they believed it. But now they do believe it, because they’re dumb.

                        The alleged absence of meaning in speech acts–including the written word–is simply another facet of the postmodern argument that signs bear no positive corellation to the signified. In other words, we are all occulted by language. Not only that, but cultural groups–de facto, races and ethnicities–are walled off from one another by their respective discursive structures.When somebody–Derrida or whoever–claims asserting meaning in the text is an act of whiteness, ultimately he is repudiating reason. Writing, after all–and granting certain experimental, avant-garde counterexamples–is an act of reason. And civilization, has needs built upon reason, is therefore white and must be deconstructed and dismantled.What is quite clear, however you want to slice it, is that anti-white racism animates these kooks. It probably has from the very outset.

        Z’s post today:  tl;dr:  Virtue, untrammeled, becomes vice. As two great Christian thinkers already explained long ago:““The modern world is not evil; in some ways the modern world is far too good. It is full of wild and wasted virtues. When a religious scheme is shattered (as Christianity was shattered at the Reformation), it is not merely the vices that are let loose. The vices are, indeed, let loose, and they wander and do damage. But the virtues are let loose also; and the virtues wander more wildly, and the virtues do more terrible damage. The modern world is full of the old Christian virtues gone mad. The virtues have gone mad because they have been isolated from each other and are wandering alone. Thus some scientists care for truth; and their truth is pitiless. Thus some humanitarians only care for pity; and their pity (I am sorry to say) is often untruthful.”–Chesterton“Mercy without justice is the mother of dissolution; justice without mercy is cruelty.”–Aquinas

                That’s my point. To defeat them, we have to offer an alternative. Trump’s America First is a (sort of) nationalism, but until you can define America or Americans, you don’t have a tangible replacement.

        Political labeling is downstream from evolutionary reality. Some of us still regard root productivity as the only moral good that matters (because the alternative leads to extinction). However, sustained and improving productivity always leads to affluent excess and then a cohort of the population soon learns that free-riding works. As the parasites grow in number, their grift can only be propagated through political cons that succeed in fooling the masses. Any con will do if it works to achieve that goal.

        I detect an attempt to return to progressivism’s earlier focus on wealth disparity. Demonization of the Tech Bros as oligarchs, and MAGA as their political weapon, is being floated. Inflation has been noticed. You get the picture.Their problem is it will not work and will fail spectacularly. People no longer have long memories but even a goldfish recalls the progressive love affair with billionaires of less than a year ago. Heck, Biden hung Medals of Freedom around the necks of a couple of them mid-month. It may be drawing to a close but many progressive organizations are the personal projects of Gates, Soros and the like, demanding transgender bathrooms while ignoring capital gains rates.It is no small irony that but/for the easily recalled recent history, it would have worked. Economic issues, wealth disparity and class struggle never have been worse. Progressives chose badly. This is the bitter end of more than a century of progressivism, and the Great Satan it battered relentlessly has driven a stake through its heart.And to add to what must be a toxic irony, a plausible economic Left is badlyneeded. No one in the West is positioned to deliver it any longer. The Golden Age likely will put the Gilded Age to shame, and any potential William Jennings Bryant is too busy counting his 30 pieces of silver to demand everyone else get some coin.

            While I am not one to fret about ‘wealth disparity,’ it’s hard not to notice the wealthy and the upper class elites have mostly gotten wealthy bilking the system in some way, not by inventing new things that make our lives better.  Hierarchy is natural and nothing to fight, but now we have a system that rewards corruption and dishonesty.

        It may be the death of Progressivism as the Imperial Faith. That only means the rollbacks of intersectional flags in military, diplomacy and business.The demon always seeks new hosts, but its declining power has also likely been a result of demographic changes that have been reducing the number of viable vessels for some time now.In the end it will probably evolve to fit a new landscape of peoples and cultures. The current period is probably a kind of “thaw” or “передышка” to borrow from the Cold War terminology. A time to catch a breath from all those religious exertions.

        “Ideology is, after all, a set of moral claims backed by the authority of reason. The two great industrial wars in Europe were about how we ought to organize ourselves.”
That’s too broad and sweeping, Zman.
Neither Germany nor France nor Britain nor Germany sought grand cultural or poltical changes during WWI, the war of 1914-1918.
“…how we ought to organize ourselves…”  Who is this “we,” Mr. Zman?Big changes may have resulted  from WWI, But not because the elites in those countries began the war seeking big cultural or political changes.

        Non-Europeans love to point fingers and talk about the decline of Christianity in Europe, but I don’t buy it. To me, Christianity is in many respects institutional over there, like city council or the court system. People don’t need to attend every city council meeting or trial for the institution to remain omnipresent and relevant.I see churches packed on the holidays. The fact that people have better things to do the other 40 weeks of the year doesn’t bother me at all. Besides, doesn’t the bible say that you weren’t supposed to judge other people in the manner of faith? It seems like people who are saying these things are pointing fingers and judging.

            In the same sense that even the west’s atheists are Christians, Europe is still very Christian. But it’s become the dyke archbishop flavor of Christianity. Indeed the Satan Pope approves of every EU policy so reliably that one can wonder if they run it by him first.
