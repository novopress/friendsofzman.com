        Many, many people voted for Trump precisely because he seemed to be on the outside of the Clinton/Bush/Obama/Uniparty swamp.  People are figuring out that the Swamp is real.Does this crapfest get properly sorted and the bad guys get their comeuppance?  No idea.  But, in the meantime, Trump’s tenure as President has made clear to anyone paying attention that the Uniparty/Deep State/Swamp exists.  The mask is off, the elites and their allies are on the march, and everyone knows it.  Interesting times.The Conservative Treehouse (“CTH”) is a must-read for understanding the players and the game.  There are so many players, so entwined with each other in a web of relationships and shared operations, and so many aspects to this Trump smear game, that it can be overwhelming.  CTH takes a granular approach that can be frustrating to follow at times, but it all adds up to a big picture that is easy to see if you are a long time reader.  Coming cold to the site, even in the last six months, can be an exercise in confusion and overwhelming detail.  The author, who calls himself “Sundance”, seems to recognize the complexity and granularity issue, and frequently tries to convey the “big picture” in some of his posts.  Unfortunately, the complexity and breadth of the wrongdoing is hard to convey in a big picture exercise.  The details inside of the details are what makes the case against all of these people (and there are so many, distributed throughout the government and the population) so compelling.  To catalogue it all and make a narrative out of the entire story (as we know it so far) would be an epic production, that would go on and on.  CTH simply provides the story a piece of a chapter at a time.  I know of no other place where all of this wrongdoing is so meticulously catalogued.

            Dutch, as a long-time CTH reader, I share your opinion of that site.  I agree with you about how hard it is to understand  either the big picture or the details.  I agree also that a full accounting would be an epic production.However, I also believe that someone in possession of all the facts could make a compelling cliffs-notes (or classics comics)  version: accurate, brief, clear, and emphatic.  Maybe that will happen at some point, maybe not.But I know that my acquaintances who are Trump haters — who seem otherwise to be intelligent and well-educated people — will refuse to believe anything that puts Trump in a favorable or sympathetic light, no matter how clearly stated.For me, discovering this about my acquaintances has been a bigger shock than seeing the mask of the deep state slip a bit.

                Cerulean, to your last statement, “me too”.The difficulty that Sundance at CTH has is that as each element of the multiple conspiracies becomes known, he has to chase it down.  There is no full accounting of what has been going on yet.  Piece by piece, the complexion of things is being assembled.  Sundance seems to be very skilled at taking details and building a coherent picture out of them.  New details keep emerging.It is also astonishing to think that if Hillary had won, all of this would be under the radar and covered up.  How much has gone on in recent decades that we know nothing about?

                    Sundance is one of the most astute people out there. Nailed the establishment strategy to get !Jeb! the nomination by flooding the primaries with candidates so he could win with low percentages early on.
I think this had a lot to do with Trump getting early right wing support.

                        “Nailed the establishment strategy …”
Yes, nailed it.
That strategy was complicated in cast and detail but breathtakingly simple in purpose and design.  Good on Sundance!
I’m guessing the russiagate hoax will turn out to have been similar.

        Fuuuuuuuukkkkkkkk.   There are going to be a few sudden deaths before this lit fuse reaches the powder keg.   Stupid ass obama crossed the ole Rubicon, if you ask me.  Trump will play this hand all the way to forcing the Dem party to be banned as a criminal organization.  Kind of curious how many names are at the top of this org-chart.

            No, trump is getting in line and attacking the Middle East against his campaign promises now.
Our side: no wall, no exit of trade agreements, no immigration restriction, some vague tax bill which helped me zip
Them:  capital to Jerusalem, attacking Syria, scrapped Iran deal
How’s that balance for you?

                    Agree, it’s not trumps “fault”, per se, but there are hidden forces which we can probably not imagine.  Trump likely had good intentions but is alas out of his depth(and perhaps of any individual).

                To quote another theory by a certain hipster:“The Deep State – the CIA – hates Trump because Trump is working for the Mossad. CIA likes to think of Mossad as their annoying kid brother. Sure, they are annoyed by him, and he is always doing shit that pisses them off (see the last half of the W. administration, or the entire Obama administration) but he’s still family. But now? Now the President of the United States is literally a foreign agent. Jared Kushner, literally a Prince of the Mossad through his father, is now calling the shots. Israel is ruining the American imperial plans for the oil regions and even making side deals with Russia. It’s intolerable for the CIA.”

        One meme I came across recently was a guy saying that Everybody says Israel is our only friend in the middle east among many enemies, but he adds that before Israel we had no enemies in the middle east.
Sometimes simple insights really do say it best.
That said, before Israel we didn’t have neocons, but we had their direct forebears: Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.

        Speaking as someone who has trouble keeping track of all these swampy names, and as someone who doesn’t often bother reading the NYT or WaPo version of events, for fear of having to constantly reconstruct the true narrative from bits and bobs of fact strewn across space-time, I must thank Z for doing a great service with this post.

            The amazing thing to me is that Trump could operate in sleazy environments (NYC real estate circles and as a novice in DC campaign infrastructure-building) and not have more dirt stuck to him.  The latest info suggests that false information was fed to small-fry hangers-on in his campaign, and that the false info was then used as an excuse to initiate spying and wiretapping.  If that is as close as they could get to anything real being done wrong, Trump has clean hands, indeed.  Never would have expected that.

        Fairly old news really.  Kay Griggs said in 1997 “half the White House press corp is c i a”   The press is under-rated, they are the handlers, the elected are the operatives.  John Brennen and the clowns are evil.  We have a uni-party system.  That’s the primary reason for voting for DJT.  If he hadn’t run I would have done a write in for the Devil to not have HRC.  Trump was the only person that could defeat her.  Trump was and is a third party candidate and President.“It’s almost as if these people have some sort of hidden agenda,”   You almost stumbled upon it, there is an agenda and it’s not hidden.   Think the worst then double it, bigger than you think.  This is a coup that fired it’s opening shot(s) in 1963 the same groups are involved.  It’s not conspiracy if it’s true.

        The Trump-Russia connection made no sense from the very beginning: Why would Putin want someone in power who was going to expand US oil/gas production, demand higher NATO defense spending, and take on Iran, all policies that Putin would see as to Russia’s detriment, as opposed to Hillary, who would continue with Obama’s policies, which were far more favorable to Putin/Russia? While I still believe that there is more going on here than we can even guess, I am reminded to “Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity” (Hanlon’s Razor).

        In order for there to be a deep state there has to be a melding of the fake right, the nasty left and the fake media, which is what we have now. I think Nunes and a few others in and out of government are trying their best, but this is not Star Wars, this is real life. Will Comey, Brennan, et al be indicted? I doubt it, but I am hoping they’ve flown too close to the sun.

            As it stands, the available data says Brennan gave Comey information the FBI could use as a pretext for a warrant on Page. Now, what was the nature of the information and what was its origin. Based on testimony in front of Congress, it appears the information was not from conventional channels. What that means is hard to know, but I would assume they mean the CIA did not pick up this stuff from signal intelligence or their own investigations. That’s not a crime and Brennan may have been shrewd enough to insulate himself in case this blew up, so he used Comey as a dupe. “I was just passing along information as per procedure. What Comey did with it is not my concern.”If I had to bet, the game now is between Comey and Lynch as to who gets blamed for setting this whole thing in motion, but I doubt anything serious comes of any of it. The political class is simply too weak and corrupt to clean this up.

                You can bet the farm that Mueller’s final report will find Trump egregiously guilty (think of the prosecutorial ham sandwich analogy), and the media hordes will act as his firing squad. There are enough RINOs in CONgress to put the final nail in the POTUS coffin. To all of us in the know it will be an obvious lie of biblical proportions. But to the rest of the unwashed and ignorant  masses, the propaganda campaign will be a spectacular sight of justice reared indeed. Trump has allies, but the Deep State has far more corrupt horses, whose very existence depends on The Don going down hard. Wish it wasn’t so. But if you want an antecedent to Civil War II, you get it here in spades.

        An off topic continued from yesterday:
https://www.news24.com/Columnists/MaxduPreez/the-problem-afriforum-is-causing-the-da-20180515
The author is a fairly prominent leftist white columnist in South Africa. According to him, Julius Malema isn’t the problem, the real problem is racist whites who “won’t be pampered any longer”. Leftist whites are apparently “demonized”.
We don’t have an effective way to deal with our traitors, who get rewarded with media sinecures. Kayne West says a few centrist things and his own community disowns him. Black movements normally tire of “white allies”, as leftist whites rarely have the courage of their convictions to renounce their middle class lifestyle.

        I was pointing out to a friend that it isn’t some graphical stochastic that whenever Trump tries (or tried) to even make overtures about either not invading the world or  not inviting the world, that the pressure on his private life and his person was stepped up, and “scandals” involving Trump were all the rage. Then as soon as he backs any Israeli expansion of power or talks about “doors in his Wall” (which still hasn’t been built) or passing “any immigration bill,” the tenor of the articles changes to “Trump is finally being presidential.” Explain to me again why the neocons are trying to thwart Trump now? He’s the Jewiest (sic) president of the modern era, abrasive New Yorker, hangs out with black sleazebag entertainers, molests every Shiksa not nailed down, has a demonic Jew son-in-law and a convert for a daughter, and now he deliberately tries to foment another neocon war-of- choice in the Middle East. Okay, Paul Krugman and the “New Yorkers” think he’s an anti-semite, but that’s only because he meets Joseph Sobran’s definition of an anti-semite as someone whom Jews hate.

            Missing the point entirely. Trump is about gas under $5 a gallon and the Iran deal is about gas at st least ten. Iran and Russia benefit as do “green” insiders who have deals in place.
The Middle East has been a place of war since 2300 bc. This is all about the money. Obama and cronies making billions off high gas prices.

                Whiskey, you’ve descended into talk radio talking points since you’ve stopped writing your blog. The same dumbasses pushing the line you’re pushing were talking about our imminent energy independence and our ability to no longer import foreign oil anymore a couple of years ago. People who lie constantly depend on the people they lie to having incredibly short memories. Of course the Middle East has a long history of war; human beings have a long history of war, and human beings inhabited that region for a very long time. But weapons technologically and a couple other logistic factors differed in 2300 b.c. I’ve never understood your nigh-on religious dick-riding/interference-running on behalf of Jews (your saccharine eulogy to Laurence Auster churned my stomach, and I was actually friends with the guy). Your average alt-right person would accuse you of being a crypto-Jew or Jewish yourself, but I won’t do that, merely because I’ve seen too many evangelicals (in my own family) fawn over God’s chosen people. But you’re not religious, so it’s hard to speculate on your motivation.

                        I met him in New Hope (small town in Pennsylvania) when I think he was getting some medical treatment in West Chester or recovering there. He did not have a very high opinion of his famous cousin Paul’s latest book at the time. We corresponded for awhile, but he was totally irascible and I’m somewhat contentious, so it ended like pretty much every friendship he had. Auster is like the J.D. Salinger of the dissident right; very large footprint based on a very small but instrumental body of work. My guess is, if he were alive, he would be closer to David Horowitz than to Bill Kristol in his assessment of Trump: the relocation of the capital in Israel, the bellicosity in the Middle East, etc, he would have loved it all. He would ignore the cucking on the Wall and spend a lot of time chastising people like Anne Coulter for not understanding that the point and purpose of America is to protect Israel.

        Is it any surprise that the FBI would turn out to be a “King Maker”–Or “King Breaker”— in this case, akin to the Praetorian guards of Rome? Look at the legacy of John Edgar Hoover, who used the agency as his own personal blackmailing instrument. He conditioned the FBI to continued to conform to like a trained dog to the will successive leaders and their private agendas, with no moral spine among the agents to arrest their superiors for abusing their office and the trust of the American people.Whereas the CIA never even had a moral code of conduct to begin with, armed with exclusive carte blanc, answering to no one as the covert foreign policy agent of the nation.The tools of government designed to serve the people are too easily turned into weapons of oppression when they are left without oversight and accountability by just men.

        A little OT, but has anyone (Z-man?) come up with a satisfying explanation for why the neo-cons have lost their (singular and collective) minds since Trump’s election?  Kristol/Boot/Peters/Rubin/Ioffe, etc.,: to read any of them now provokes feelings of embarrassment *for* them.   What is it they lost?   What is it they wanted to happen?   Their writings and mouth-noises are the stuff of insane people.  I get why I, as a supporter of Candidate Trump, am a little disappointed, but what exactly is their beef?

                    I think the globalist/open borders thing plays into all this much more deeply than we know. The de facto “world government”, with its focus on a rental economy via migrations, remittances, Climate cult Carbon $$$, mandatory birth control, UN Sustainable Development Goals, etc., has been making good headway especially since GWB’s election (yes I know it started long before, but the World Bank’s working papers on making it happen started showing up around the turn of the century), Obama did not interfere and even enjoyed helping it along.  Putting Bill Clinton back in the White House with Hillary’s “belated” presidency would have let the Globalists wrap everything up once and for all.

        Krystol was saying even before the election that the plan, if Trump were to be elected, was to get him out of office in 6 months.  I had no small number of friends saying, “He won’t last 6 months before he’s impeached.”  The idea being that they could vote for Trump and get Pence, and all would be okay.  A lot of people bought into Plan D once Plans A through C failed.So, here we are almost 2 years later…The leaks lately coming out of Congress are very much in tune with how people think the IG Report is going to play out…and that’s not an accident.  Much of what Congress knows is due to stuff the DOJ IG has been giving them either directly or indirectly.  I don’t think it’s a coincidence or that Congress just happens to be finding out things at the same time as the IG.  McCabe is a good example of this.  He was on his way out the door mid-way through 2017.  That process was accelerated as drafts of the DOJ IG report started circulating.  Then McCabe was told to hit the bricks.  Then, as the report was finalized, he was fired.More heads will roll.

            I think McCabe will be charged with something. He’s being taken care of, so unless he is facing serious time, he will not fink on his partners. Page and Strzok will get charged with something and agree to testify against McCabe. That’s going to be the extent of it. Horowitz will issue a grand report that hints around at all sorts of things, but no big fish will be indicted or even directly accused. Instead, it will be lots of blather about the culture of the FBI.

                Just the fact that the IG referred criminal charges on McCabe hints that more is coming.  Yeah, I think they will fry some of the small fish.  Comey’s 15 minutes of fame is going to come to an ignominious end as the complete botching of the email investigation – based on political considerations, Comey’s own words – becomes a big part of the report.The other piece of this, and I think this is coming out of the IG Report not Congress, is the mole the FBI placed inside the Trump campaign.  It’ll get papered over in a lot of technocratic jargon that makes it look like the FBI was pursuing some sort of legitimate lead, but the IG Report will cast a lot of doubt on that but stop short of actually accusing Comey and Lynch of running a spy operation on behalf of the Clinton Campaign.People won’t get their wish for heads in nooses over trying to execute a coup d’etat after the election.  But, enough will be in the IG Report for Trump to put an end to the Mueller investigation because the IG Report so far has gutted most of the people responsible for the Hillary email debacle…the same people working so hard to trump up these Russia-conspiracy charges against Trump.  It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that with one hand they were protecting Hillary while with the other hand they were trying to take out Trump.Probably enough in it for the Congress to impeach and remove Rosenstein.  Trump doesn’t have to do it by himself.  More evidence will come forth that Trump was right to fire Comey, even if Trump didn’t have all the facts last year when he did it.  At least a half dozen more FBI/DOJ employees get the axe as the swamp loses several more alligators.IG Report = political cover for Trump and the GOP.  Also, pretty motivating heading into the fall elections.

                Heh. In U.S. National politics, from the Bill Clinton 1990s onwards, at least as regards scandal/corruption on the part of officialdom, the final outcome being only a few indictments but with “lots of blather” is always the smart way to bet!

                    I’m not seeing it.  I think some added people will go down.  Mueller is out there trying to stay alive through the Fall elections. If the Dems don’t take at least the House, he probably closes up shop.
DOJ IG certainly appears to be rolling up a nice little body count over there.  Worst case, several more heads roll.  Best case, IG shows that partisans in the FBI launched the Russia investigation because they wanted to counter the damage done by Hillary to herself.

                        The crew over at Conservative Treehouse have been pretty good at laying out the intricacies of the FBI/DOJ “insurance policy” to take out Trump.  If the IG report is as comprehensive at they think it will be, many heads will roll.

        In retrospect, it had to be the neocons behind this stuff. Conventional liberal-left types are way too disorganized and mostly personality disordered to be able to carry out any kind of organized conspiracy. As you say, the question is why. What do the neocons want that Trump posses such a threat to their agenda? It can’t be about supporting Israel. Trump has done more for Israel, in a non-neocon manner, than the past 4 presidents. It has to be something else.

                That’s what I don’t know. The only thing I can think of is that they are all in the employ of the defense contractors. Having lots of enemies and a shooting war now and then (providing there is never a threat to the homeland itself) provides lots of contracts and therefor profits to the military contractors. The only other explanation I can come up with is that its some kind of ideological crusade on the part of the neocons. There may be other explanations I can not think of right off the bat.

                I’m not disagreeing with you, Alex, but I have to admit that I do find it strange that the John Brennan moslem conversion thing spills close to zero ink in the MSM (or even such right-leaning outlets as there are.) After all, if Gen. MacArthur started regularly attending Shinto temples in the late 1940s, or if Ike or even that nutter Patton* started making offerings to Thor and Wotan in the aftermath of the War in Europe, can you imagine such an event NOT making “page one” headlines everywhere?*Yes, George Patton was the USA’s most brilliant general of the 1940s, and a great patriot.  I am not denying that. But he was also a nut.

            There is no conclusive evidence that Brennan converted to Islam. But I dug this out of the Wikipedia article on him:
“In 1976, he voted for Communist Party USA candidate Gus Hall in the presidential election; he later said that he viewed it as a way ‘of signaling my unhappiness with the system, and the need for change’.”

            I probably should have spent more time on that topic. Yeah, he has seemed to be anti-neocon at times, but he also turns up in the same ponds as them more often than not. Maybe not a full-on neocon, but more of a fellow traveler when convenient.
Thanks for the correction.

                    I updated the post. I would not go so far as to call him a “conservative insider” since there are no conservatives in government, at least not at this layer. Those guys were run off in the 1980’s. Of course, it is entirely possible he is a dupe here too. But, none of this has much to do with the point of the post. Harper could be a rabid anarcho-syndicalist and it does not change his role in this drama. All of these guys, on the surface at least, appear to have been willing to engage in a scheme to destabilize the normal functioning of the state.

                        Dunno, I regard him as a Brit, so it’s hard for me to place him in a neocon frame since neoconism is, for the most part, a domestic political cult here in the US. But certain Brits, particularly those involved with the transatlantic intel bureaucracy, hate Brexit. Really hate it. Hence they’re not gonna be Trump fans. It’s that simple if you’re looking for Halper’s motive. Anti-Trump is a fairly broad coalition, not just neocons, and I’m pretty sure guys like Brennan, Comey, Simpson, and Steele aren’t merely careerist Obamaites.

                            Could be. He is an American and he worked for Nixon, Ford and Reagan. His book America Alone: The Neo-Conservatives and the Global Order was a critical analysis of neoconservatives, but lots of neoconservatives liked it.
As is true with most of our political labels, they don’t really work well now. It’s not as if there is an alternative to neocon thought on the right side of the political class. The neocons are the right side of the political class. Any criticism of them either comes from outside the political class or from friendly voices inside the political class.

        Do you know, with Biblical certainty, that Brennan is NOT a Communist?
I doubt it.  I suspect he’s been a member of the Party for quite some time, just like the guy who appointed him, Obama.
Now then:  show me why I should NOT believe that.  Go ahead.  I’ll wait.
