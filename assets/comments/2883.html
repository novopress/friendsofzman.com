        The presidency is Hillary’s to lose.  Ignore the poles that put Romney ahead of Hillary.  Hillary will win for two simple reasons; she is female and she is a Democrat.

        Re: The Revolutionary” – Sidney RittenbergTake a moment to read the comments attacking this piece. They do a good job taking the writer apart for her naivety and her acceptance of ” good intentions” as an excuse for evil outcomes.(see below)“…There is still a slightly smelly acceptance among some progressive quarters to overlook the heinous crimes of communism.

        Even when I have been disenfranchised from God and synagogue, I have always been culturally proud to be a Jew. A source of that pride is the Jewish tradition of helping the oppressed, and our involvement in social movements such as labor and civil rights. Until I saw the documentary “The Revolutionary” at the Philadelphia Independent Film Festival, I mistakenly thought that China during the revolutionary period was one country that had not felt the Jewish embrace. In fact, 85 to 90% of the foreigners helping the Chinese at the time of the Communist takeover were Jewish. This included the…Read more »
