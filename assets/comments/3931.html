        They are not harassing people to get their jollies, that’s a side benefit. They are sending a message. Here in Nevada an opponent–an effective opponent–of our Republican stealth progressive governor’s massive tax increase scheme endured a late full swat team raid into his home to remove every paper and computer he owned.The message in Texas is meant for all citizens to understand that the state will simply not be trifled with. “When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another…” means they are going to dissolve you.

        “I don’t have any sympathy for these idiots. What did they think was going to happen? Challenging the existing government is a joke, until it’s not a joke. Existing governments don’t stay existing governments by letting stuff like this slide.”
I think you mean, “I for one welcome our new insect overlords.”
Maybe their legal tactics are questionable, but this secession group did nothing to threaten the state.  This armed confrontation is unconstitutional, criminal, and morally abominable.  The Founding Fathers would be shooting by now.

        I don’t have any sympathy for these idiots. What did they think was going to happen? Challenging the existing government is a joke, until it’s not a joke. Existing governments don’t stay existing governments by letting stuff like this slide.If you intend to establish a new hegemon for God’s sake keep it secret until you are ready to start shooting people. I’m on record as viewing political activism of any kind as a complete waste of time. These fools could have spent the time and money doing something helpful for their community, but I don’t think they really have one or know what it is, other than some imaginary state.
