        “They want nothing more than to get employed, play their taxes and be able to do the normal stuff you and I take for granted,” said Chandrasekar.“PLAY” their taxes… they are already liberals….  and just hazarding a guess, but I’m thinking ‘Ruben Chandrasekar’ ain’t an indigenous Marylander, so I’m sure he has compassion for them…

        What to do with the “settlers”  coming to America?  Every immigrant  is assigned a democrat and the democrat is responsible for the care, feeding and housing of said immigrant. Should they fail in their task,  said immigrant will be deported and the democrat charged for the costs incurred therein.  If democrats are so concerned with these “dreamers” and “refugees”  they will jump at the chance to help their brown brothers and sisters assimilate.  Oh democrats, where are you?

        Tompall Glase’s old song “Streets of Baltimore”- wonder if it was ironic even then. Gonna reconsider going to the lax coaches’ convention in January!

        Everyone should go read blogger, book author &amp; boxerJames LaFondfor further Baltimore adventures! He has a Fred Reed like writing style and is reporting from the middle of it all… not just from the edges like you Z :).

        If as you say Baltimore is not great these days and the cops have given upon their primary task, then importing a bunch of temporarily grateful people will work for now. Of course, as I often note, the people who institute these policies will be long gone by the time the unhappiness explodes from the imports or their offspring (usually it seems to be the 3rd generation who get really pissed with their ‘homeland’ and imagine there was heaven on earth in their original country, but maybe in our era of haste and rush it will come sooner.) No matter, because the instigators will have already fled to safer places or been voted out of office by then,  whereupon they will retire to somewhere safer.The paradox is that the people who either voted these instigators in or tacitly supported them will be the ones left holding the self-detonating baby and wondering why they ended up with the clock ticking.
