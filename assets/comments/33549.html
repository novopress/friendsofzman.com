        Good to be reminded of the Three Horsegirls of the Libyan Apocalypse – Samantha Power, Susan Rice and Hillary Clinton. They destroyed Libya, turning it into a third-world shithole. Without Gaddafi to prevent it, there was a mass exodus of non-White “refugees” into Europe. That was deliberate. Those three are traitors. The Deep State is anti-White. In 2015, Angela Merkel (another traitor) made it official.In 2021, Biden appointedSamantha Powerto run USAID, which uses “foreign aid” as a cover for subversion worldwide. And now this criminal organization is being destroyed. Good riddance! Defund the Deep State!

        Off topic but I wanted to share this with the z listeners re where culture comes from.This is from the mountain people of English descent researched by the great English musicologist Cecil sharp (a friend of Ralph von Williams) he documented hundred of songs from the mountains of North Carolina Virginia and Tennessee in the 1910s. Shelia Kay Adams is kind of an accident of history that she kept the old cultural tradition of her little town in Madison co North Carolina.my point is both sharp and Adams confess their culture comes from biology. Adams of course wouldn’t put it quite like that but she comes close when she says if her 72 first cousins half are musicians and that the four families in her town all intermarried over generations and that’s where the strength of the singing tradition comes from. Sharp says it explicitly:“That the illiterate may nevertheless reach a high level of culture will surprise those only who imagine that education and cultivation are convertible. The reason, I take it, why these mountain people, albeit unlettered, have acquired so many of the essentials of culture is partly to be attributed to the large amount of leisure they enjoy, without which, of course, no cultural development is possible, but chiefly to the fact thatthey have one and all entered at birth into the full enjoyment of their racial heritage. Their language, wisdom, manners, and the many graces of life that are theirs, are merely racial attributes which have been gradually acquired and accumulated in past centuries and handed down generation by generation,each generation adding its quotum to that which it received. It must be remembered, also, that in their everyday lives they are immune from that continuous grinding, mental pressure, due to the attempt to ‘make a living’, from which nearly all of us in the modern world suffer. Here no one is on the make; commercial competition and social rivalries are unknown. In this respect, at any rate, they have the advantage over those who habitually spend the greater part of every day in preparing to live, in acquiring the technique of life, rather than in its enjoyment.Cecil Sharp; English Folk Songs from the Southern Appalachians 1917here Adams talks about her family and how the songs teach about life without having to experience, which is a great definition of what culture should do: teach, and then when one experiences something, there is something to compare it too:https://youtu.be/qFeocCJUQk0?si=vcF2EOEePKBgqpHVhere she painfully tells how her mother purposely pushed those songs away in order to enter mass democracy and a middle classs life:https://youtu.be/iw8S92_SGYs?si=AobXCNB_jQ8wwyMc

        I’d like to know, how long has USAID been pulling this crap? Did it start with Samantha Power? If so, where did the wasted money come from? Did their budget get a big boost in 2021, or were funds diverted from the sorts of projects the agency was created to carry out?
If it was going on before Biden and Power, how many Republican administrations turned a blind eye to it?

            “The left” worldwide has been a false, state- and bank-funded pseudo-phenomenon since before the Russian revolution, if that’s what you mean. Think of the USSR as Russia conquered by the West—analogous to America (traditional) having being conquered by managerialism or Jews or whatever—and the “geopolitical” world becomes more comprehensible.USAID has been what it is since its invention by JFK. Conspiracy noticers are prone to valorize him, since he seems like a co-victim of our shared criminal enemy (no matter who we think that is), but he, more than any president, made rule by the professional/commissar class official andimperial. “Cosmopolitan,” if you prefer. His death was a great loss to them—an accidental one, I think. But his legacy survived. It’s been our ruin.I always warn against converts, new allies, sudden sense-making from bad actors. Check out Tucker’s latest show with Mike Benz. Look howsadhe is, how hard he’s chewing up the set to make us long for our lost empire. (Our?) Trump may have actuallydone something—killed Kennedy for real.

            Right. So Yanks have a broom with a screwdriver to show for their massive spending. EU doesn’t even have that.
Hopefully Trump is smart enough (or has advisors smart enough) to let EU fight its own battles. I’m hopeful that is the case on both war zones. Yes, one can interpret the ME as an indication he’s not willing to let them deal with it, but in his true bull-in-a-china-closet fashion, pointed out to EVERYONE is that it’s not just Israel — not a single country wants Palestinians. They are nothing but trouble.

                    Oops. Are they saying that, too? I just don’t have the reserves to keep abreast of politics in other countries.
I just looked Starmer up. That’s him, isn’t it?

        Regarding crab, and the best way to kill/cook it, boiling a whole crab is the worst way to go. It would be like roasting your deer without field dressing it first. The best way to deal with a crab, as told to me by the captian at brookingsfishing.com, is to “half back” it.I couldn’t find a good link online, best I could find ishttps://short-fact.com/can-you-cut-a-crab-in-half/#How_do_you_half_back_a_crabBasically, by splitting the crab in two, this kills the crab instantly (as you would want to do with your deer), gets rid of the guts. and leaves just the meat, which can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week, or cooked immedately,

            Best crab I ever had was thrown live on the grill and the lid shut for a while. Low heat, more or less smoked. Sorry can’t remember how long. Mostly I agree with Derb that crab tends not to be worth the trouble.
