        Trump is an untrustworthy, unhinged moron. We knew about both of these attacks. He campaigned on stopping these “wars of choice.” Yet here we are. We violated the START treaty by letting our Ukie “friends” blow up a big chunk of the Russians’ strategic bomber force. We allowed and assisted Israel with their unprovoked attack on Iran. It’s so sickening that our foreign policy is run in Tel Aviv.Our diplomatic credibility is shot to hell. So much for his “dealmaking” acumen.I love how our choice at the ballot box in November was a weird, narcissistic blowhard or an 85-IQ, white-hating lunatic. In Congress, it’s either the blatantly anti-white party or the party that talks a good game and always finks on their voters.I stayed home precisely for that reason. What a country.If the Strait of Hormuz is closed, Trump needs to be impeached and thrown out of office. He needs to take the blame for $10 gasoline at the pump and the cratering of our economy. Then we need to RICO AIPAC and the ADL into oblivion and leave Israel to their own devices. I don’t give a damn about Israel. Or Iran. Or Ukraine. Or Russia. Or Syria. Or any of these damned countries. I’m sick of the GAE and sick of all of the damage caused by our idiotic meddling.

Same here. Somehow in the absolute bottom of my gut I knew that Trump would ultimately fail to deliver on much of his heady campaign talk.

            People wonder how American voters could have been so foolish to elect W. Wilson and FDR because “they promised to keep us out of wars!”.
All of American politics is a Lucy yanking the ball away from Charlie Brown moments.
This time it will be different!

                It’s like that insurance commercial with the guy with the fishing line and a dollar attached. As Zman says, the solutions are easy, but so many entrenched, wealthy interests won’t allow them.

            Woodrow Wilson’s 1916 re-election campaign slogan was “He kept us out of war.”
FDR’s 1940 campaign slogan was “Your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars.”

                    Yes, thank you Boris the Spider — good add.
As the level of discourse sinks into the mud, propaganda goes down with it. At this point I am just waiting for the ‘Iranians spear infants on bayonets’ or ‘tip over incubators’ or the grandest of them all, something, something ‘rape’.

            When Trump pushed for $300B increase in defense spending two weeks back (after all DOGE song and dance), did he know about the Russian and Iranian operations and potential expansion of the wars?
I understand that such questions are less intellectually challenging for Zman than Rand Paul bashing.

                    Not only that, but it is abundantly clear that Trump fully intends to force us into a cashless-economy-total-surveillance police state. But he intends to do it via Palantir and the private sector rather than precipitate a Constitutional crisis by trying to do it via a CBDC.

            I’m willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt that he was giving Jewish interests enough rope to hang themselves. (For now, that is.) I’m also keeping an open mind to what you are saying. If what you are saying is true, it’s a little disturbing that he is using the same tactics of the same people in the establishment he has been so critical of.
The rest of your post was spot on.

            Chances are high he didn’t even know about them beforehand.  I’m just as mad about the Iran situation as anyone else and his after the fact comments were indeed moronic, but I am not convinced he even knew about either attack.
He is one guy up against a million plus bureaucrats.

                        Agree. I think he was trying to run in front of the parade, in both directions. He’s from the “always sell it” school, even when he’s promoting people who end up stabbing him or his voters in the back.  A “no regrets” kind of guy.

            But what can we expect? As Z has noted many times, our politicians are just actors hired to play a part. What makes Trump seemingly unpredictable and creates so much chaos is he is an actor who likes to improvise rather than sticking to the script.
Trump desperately wants to be an alpha dog but learned from his first goround that he will end up in jail is he displeases his masters.

        We are at the End of Empire stage. Any president in these circumstances would be flailing around. Trump just makes it more dramatic. Even if the American public supported all this foreign-policy chicanery, which it doesn’t, it’s not clear Trump could enforce his will in Ukraine or Iran. Meanwhile, we ‘ve taught our friends and “enemies” to 1) absolutely get nuclear weapons or suffer regime change 2) wait us out, because we cannot sustain a long-term policy requiring discipline and are self-destructing anyway and 3) never negotiate with us because we’re incapable of honoring any agreement or even the diplomatic process itself..

            Yes.  Completely agree.  The read out from Putin’s call to Trump after the Israeli attacks seemed to me that Putin is letting Trump know that no more deals are possible.  Putin seems to have also referred to Trump and Bibi as engaging in war crimes.    This in polite diplomatic terms as Putin is known for.

        I have no idea what is going to happen, but I noticed that the JIDF on X and the conservative media were triumphant the night Israel kicked it off but eerily quiet the next day after Iran responded. The NY Post pushed it off the main page and focused on the assassination of that Minnesota lawmaker. That tells me it didn’t go the way they wanted.I hate to be a doomer, but Trump’s response to the attacks not only highlighted all his worst elements, but probably killed his 2nd term. As Z wisely points out, everyone can see the similarities between this attack and Ukraine’s, thus proving that the CIA and Mossad (but I repeat myself) are heavily involved in both. Despite Trump’s talk of a desire for peace, it’s obvious that (A) the tail is still wagging the dog and he is not in control of his own operation, and (B) he’s so desperate to appear like he is that he will say insane and stupid things just to try to show it. Russia cannot negotiate with a guy who bragged about bad faith negotiations to help war criminal Netanyahu. Nobody can. I mean, it’s no secret that America is not an honest broker and the “rules based order” is a joke but now there are no more pretenses. The only thing that can hold this together is force, and a country that struggled against a bunch of guys living in tents cannot hold it together with force.

Even better have Epstein standing at the back next to his painting of Bill Clinton in a dress.Really tie a bow on the whole thing.

                    Well we do have the following A.I.BTW, it’s been about 2025 – 1998 = 27 years since Miss Jewinsky went all cigar humidor.At this point, anyone with a strong adult memory of Miss Jewinsky would just about have to be a grandparent.And peeps with a living memory of Marilyn Monroe, or Mary Pinchot Meyer, would be furiously battling Alzheimer’s in a nursing home.BTW, if you go to the Wikipedia page for Monica Jewinsky, and find the “Scandal” section…https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Lewinsky#Scandal…and if you then scroll your mouse pointer over the words “oral sex“, you’ll get a rather explicit picture of the nature of the act.Can’t tell whether or not it’s circumcised.I’ve never before seen anything quite like that at Wikipedia…

                I still think that Trump sincerely wanted to make a deal, and was very skeptical of Netanyahu (recall he got rid of Waltz after Waltz was caught huddling with Netanyahu on war plans) but as I said, he isn’t running his own operation. What is pathetic is his after-the-fact attempt to make it sound like he is in charge and was running some big kayfabe operation with Israel – something they immediately started backing away from when it became clear that the attack wasn’t the total unbridled success that the media was pretending it was.I know this is a total fantasy but if Trump got out there and said “we had nothing to do with it, we don’t support it, this causes a lot of problems for us and we are cutting assistance to Israel until they cease these attacks, they’re on their own” then I would know he is serious and in charge. But, he’s not.

                    The United States president largely is powerless outside of a very narrowly prescribed range. All Western leaders are at best puppets at this point. There is no question Trump is not in charge in the foreign policy sphere. Americans increasingly treat their system as the late-stage East Bloc folks did–with jaundiced and bemused contempt, and that is far too generous. I hope they are not as restrained with their oppressors when it all collapses.

You’re right, of course, but that would only move the Israelis to use the Samson Option. And they *will* do it if their backs are against the wall–and that day appears to be fast approaching.

                        Well, this is the core problem isn’t it. We don’t have leaders running this country. It’s possible, likely even, that JFK didn’t know what he was up against and what they were willing to do. Is Trump so blind? I doubt it. He just chose to play ball. He doesn’t have the spine to stand up to these people, and he just got pantsed in front of the entire world.Obviously the situations were different, but Putin stopped the same group of people from treating his people like disposable objects when he got into office. The option to lead always exists.

                            Trump has to know they’ll take him out, I mean they’ve already tried at least twice. Rumor of our best little friends being involved with JFK might also be known by Trump, thus giving him pause to cross them. I wish he would rise to the challenge, he does seem to sense he could be a transformational president, but as you say he just doesn’t have the stones to rise to the occasion. It’s disappointing but was completely predictable. At best maybe he’ll be the one to begin the collapse that’s needed.

                                Agreed. The only way this ends is when Israel – or at least the Zionist entity – ends. That is almost certainly on the cards. Israel was created as a safe haven for all Jews about the Shoah. Today, Jews are safer in Germany and Poland than in Israel. Think about that. Israel is done.

                    The narrative engineers lead by the usual suspects sold Mr. Trump on the brilliance of the Israeli plan and stroked his insufferable ego, ‘. . . Mr President, you will be remembered throughout history as the defender of Israel and the lion who defeated the Ayatollahs. . .’ or something to that effect.  Unfortunately narrative engineers have no use for facts on the ground.  Now that the facts have intruded, Mr. Trump can not likely bear up under the bombardment without intervening to save their skins.  The first step, of course, is bombastic threats.  If Iran does not back down, the US will have to attack and the economy will tank.  So much for the golden age.

            You aren’t being a doomer; you’re just being realistic. Trump lied to all his voters. I don’t see him lasting out his term. As for the Israelis “winning”, if that were true, they wouldn’t be a) enforcing a total news blackout and b) desperately begging Uncle Shmuel to jump in.

            No, there would be a radically different Iranian regime. The Mullahs regime is based morally on overthrowing the Sunni monarchies and “protecting” the Shia in the Arabian peninsula, destroying the Little Satan, and destroying the Great Satan. The Iranian National Anthem literally has “Death to America” as part of the lyrics. This is the moral foundation of the Regime back to the Revolution and for the most part Iran’s populace rejects it. The regime exists only by force.The mechanics of the Regime is a familial, clan based system encompassing the Mullahs at the top, next IRGC commanders, who are all inter-related from the same clans and all take a taste off the top. Imagine Tony Soprano and company running a country and that is the system. This is why when Israel launched the Pager Attack it basically paralyzed Hezbollah who so far have been a non-factor. Hezbollah works on the same way, clan/family with every leader taking a taste and distributing to their followers. It is very powerful but depends on the relative ability, charisma, leadership, and blood/family ties of the leaders to make the thing work. Take it away and you get the Cartel situation in Mexico. Every Cartel eventually splinters as there is little to create loyalty and hierarchy.A new regime would be reflective of the broader Iranian society and merchant class: urban, feminized, internationalist, and profoundly materialist in a way that the Mullahs are not. I don’t know if the regime can be overthrown. They have faced protests, riots, etc. repeatedly by people chafing at the familial rule of the Mullahs and Guard.As long as the Regime has enough money and moral legitimacy among its enforcers they will retain power. That means they can’t repeat the Shah’s mistakes and stop paying the Mullahs; they have to keep the patronage throwing to put men on the streets with guns to shoot those who oppose the regime, and convice the men with guns that they are doing Allah’s will. IF the Mullahs can no longer pay the enforces, it will be like Hezbollah.

                That’s what my TV told me, too, but I no longer believe what my TV tells me.
They’ve been telling me for more than 45 years that the population rejects the rulers. I’m sure there are some who do, but i no longer am certain those internationalist Iranians represent the people.
They told us the people of Afghanistan loved their new Western government, educating women and George Floyd murals. But they couldn’t put the Taliban back in power fast enough.

I’m sure they do (or did until Trump rallied them behind their leaders), but I doubt they want to go back to the Pahlavi era or even less forward to the “diverse” and “non-binary” society this feminist loon was pushing for.

        As a child in school I was taught that the Pearl Harbor attack was especially dastardly and pernicious because the Japanese ambassador was actively involved in diplomatic negotiations when the attack was underway.
Supposedly due to a timing issue from Tokyo that they didn’t give a formal note. Oopsie.
Now the US is patting itself on the back for being so very clever.
(How did that work out for the Japanese, anyway?  I forget)

                    It’s doable, but not possible.  For instance if he went to Iran and noted that we had nothing to do with the attacks and unilaterally lifted all sanctions with nothing in return from the Persians except for their understanding it would go a long way towards patching things up, but, yeah, not happening.

What happened was that the Japanese diplomats were waiting at the State Dept., note in hand, while Secretary Cordell Hull was at home having Sunday dinner and didn’t get in to his office until the attack was already in progress.

            The US and Japan were already fighting each other in China. With Vinegar Joe Stillwell and the Flying Tigers. What the US Navy failed to comprehend was the ability of the Japanese Navy to stage an attack that far east in the Pacific and at that scale. They viewed the spread out attacks in China as the model, and predicted what Japan was most likely to do, not the maximum it could do.This was a mistake made also during Tsavo Straights. When the Japanese Navy sailed at night to attack the US fleet of Guadalcanal, sinking much of the cruisers and battleships and forcing the Navy to retreat in panic. Leaving the US forces there on their own.

                We are also doing so in the Atlantic as well. It was an American ship, a Coast Guard cutter, that tipped off the British the location of the battleship Bismarck. With Lend Lease, we were already combatants.The funny thing about the American Volunteer Group is the stupid arrogance of the U.S. commanders, who didn’t even read the excellent intelligence reports from Claire Lee Chenault, the AVG commander, about the Japanese fighter aircraft. He told them about their incredible maneuverability and range obtained at the expense of survivability, but they were likely round-filed and our pilots had to learn things the hard way during the first year or so of the Pacific War.Chenault’s pilots already figured out that the P-40, while not a great fighter, could dive faster than a Zero (Navy) or Oscar (Army) and could survive multiple hits, whereas those planes disintegrated under even a light barrage of .50 cal gunfire.Navy and Army pilots had to learn boom and zoom (hit the enemy from high altitude in a diving, slashing attack and pull away to repeat) tactics that they should’ve been taught from the outset if those intel reports had been read.Our commanders are similarly arrogant, just as the Israelis were in this war with the Iranian ballistic missile threat.

Nothing tragic about that.  I couldn’t think of a more fitting end for the blowhard showman after he betrayed his supporters like this.

                I owe an apology too to Tulsi Gabbard. I lumped her in with that useless trio of Patel, Bongino and Barr Room Blondie. But at least she had the stones to tell Trump the truth to his face about Iran’s non-nuke. And his reply? “I don’t care what she says.” The guy is off his trolley.

        Our political system may well disintegrate if Trump allows a full US shock and awe attack on Iran. The energy of the American electorate over the past decade has been upon itself and the destruction of the middle class way of life in the US, now nearly complete. Millions of people in their 20s and 30s can now see that their lives will spent in a decaying, dying state, with few hopes for a decent, quiet life that they know only through old news broadcasts and family photographs. Full-scale war with Iran will be the final psychological domino as they face up to the fact that we do not have control over DC and are being ruled, not ruling, and that they will never leave first base.How people react to that, one cannot say. Perhaps they give up entirely. Perhaps they don’t. But a very dark confrontation is coming with reality, one that can no longer be avoided, because while you may still be able to get food, soon, you won’t be able to pay for electricity or travel very far with the resources you have on hand to pay for them. All of those “I Voted!” stickers got us…this.

            All of those “I Voted!” stickers got us…this.This is ultra cope from people desperately trying to recapture their sense of agency in order to manage their profound internal anxieties.Voting makes no difference so youre dumb if you vote AND also none of this would have happened if people didnt vote, although it makes no difference if you do vote, which you shouldn’t because it ruined everything.If it didnt make any difference then it didnt make any difference and all the smart boys imagining they like, see through it all, man… are, and always WERE in exactly the same boat as all the rest of us powerless goy lined up for the captive bolt pistol.Most Trump voters looked at the same  garbage degenerate godless strip mall country and the same disconnected levers you did and figured it was worth a shot.  People HOPED he could turn it around because despair it not just a mistake it’s an actual sin and healthy functioning people need hope to live, even if its distant and dim.  There wasnt much else to do and we had been doing that stuff anyway.The NYT would have you believe all trump voters have trump tattoos and were waiting on him to usher in the eschaton but everyone is just doing their best to make things more tolerable for themselves and their kids given that we dont actually control anything any more than you do.Its hard for people to see this but the real hard truth is not that its foolish to do the small things you can actually do to improve your situation.  The hard truth is that if youre doomed youre doomed and your psychological distancing and “akshually I predicted thith” does nothing except demoralize your allies and make auccess even more remote.Furthermore hate to tell you this but… most of you proclaiming its all over today will be back to thinking everything is going great tomorrow.  The comment section on this site oscillates like this almost daily and people never seem to even notice theyre doing it.Its really ultimate childish thinking to not have the stomach for a long painful war with an uncertain outcome and many setbacks.  Instead it’s alwaya back and forth between “we’re so back” and “it’s all over bro!” depending on the last headline.”I get that these are TERRIBlLE developments believe me, but if we havent throw outselves on the railroad tracks after that last century or so of terrible developments then maybe now is also not the time.  Actually never is the time

            Bush II split the Republican Party over the Iraq War. After he bumbled into a rack, I noticed Democrat Party campaign signs in wealthy suburbs around here that were solidly Republican until then. I don’t know if it was because they were overtly against war or because they had gotten fed up with Republicans by that point. They have become more and more Democrat over the years.Trump is going to split MAGA in the same way if he doesn’t watch this warmonger stuff.But I’m also a realist. If warmongering and looting other countries is a protection racket that makes us rich, I guess I have to hold my nose and accept reality.

            Why would you think this? Iran is the closest thing to an eternal enemy of the US and has been since 1979. As long as there is not too much inconvenience and there is no draft and mass casualties, no one will care that much.The ugly truth about material consumerism is that is an acid eating away at society, to the point where no one cares about much of anything. In that matter Nietzsche was correct about the Last Man. No one really cared that much about the Gulf War, or Iraq War, or Afghan War (which went on for 20 years). Modern, market dominated societies produce isolated individuals who consume product, await for more product. That’s it.Stuff far away gets blowed up, reall good. Meanwhile, apologies to Jello Biafra, “Give me Convenience, or Give Me Death.”

                Buddy, the US has had about five “mortal enemies” in my lifetime, and I’m not that old. Every five years there’s been a new Hitler.
I remember the Iranian Revolution and how American adults were behaving at the time. You must have been one of them. Absolutely bonkers. It’s on the other side of the world. Perhaps if we hadn’t overthrown their government in 1953 and installed our puppet the Shah, none of this would’ve ever occurred — in fact, it wouldn’t have.

            It’s interesting. If you read that wikipedia article it is clear that Sobran’s definition of anti-Semitism was true back then. “An anti-Semite used to mean a man who hated Jews. Now it means a man who is hated by Jews.”
Jews worked hard to tar people like Lindbergh and Avery Brundage as anti-Semites simply because Jews disagreed with their decisions or politics.

        Lots of black pilling going on lately.  Admittedly, Trump does bounce around from issue to issue more than is  probably necessary along with often off the cuff remarks that can be irritating.  But I think much, if not most of the chaos generated is from the blob and its fellow TDS sufferers.  They simply are unable to help themselves no matter what Trump does or says.  That said, if the jews can’t somehow be reined in, they could be the death of us all.

Probably true, but Trump should summon some MArines ad instruct them to arrest the malefactors’ and stop pussy-footing around. The stakes could hardly be higher.﻿

                We probably won’t get mass deportations (or any movement on the rest of the MAGA program) until there are mass arrests among the Blob. Trump needs to break the back of the shadow government before he can get anything else done. Does he have the stones for that? So far, I don’t see it.

        The country has gone bi-polar. I’ve noted for awhile that each successive administration has been gyrating in increasing arcs between policy extremes, resulting in wild swings in governance. It’s the oscillating bridge phenomenon, and inevitably leads to collapse. In a sort of cosmic irony Trump represents two links in this causality, his current self is a more radical version of his prior self. We should hope for a collapse sooner rather than later, as the next administration will probably go full Mao. Don’t want to be around for that.

            A couple of Substackers have already called false flag on the Nimitz. It’s hard to disagree. I hope that if a carrier goes down, it causes such a sense of revulsion in the country that we force the Zionists out and start the trials and executions. And we don’t forget the generals and the heads of the MIC.

        “We now see this in his foreign policy which looks more like a game of flipping over tables and smashing things than a coherent strategy to advance national interests.”I don’t know which cabal or loose coalition of interests is running affairs but it’s probably not Trump. I don’t see a coherent foreign policy nor do I see a coherent economic policy. If you”re talking about Trump the man, he wouldn’t recognize strategy if it kicked him in the teeth. For him it’s all about noise, motion, sensation.“There is no reason for Iran to do a deal with Washington after this betrayal of basic diplomatic norms. There is no reason for Iran to take the deal on offer, if they decided to come back to the table.”The Iranians should just stop dealing with the Americans as they can’t be trusted at any level. Like Kim Jong Un, who apparently just returns Trump’s letters unopened, And I’m not aware that there is a deal on offer — just more random and contradictory noise from the Americans, as far as I can gauge. There was a JCPOA once upon a time, but Trump. for reasons of ego, just shredded it.The ray of hope for the Americans and Israelis is that the Iranians lack the killer instinct — they were caught unprepared by the Israeli attack. The Ayatollah-led regime is not paranoid or warlike enough for the situation. Iran has lost face and credibility. It needs a Fuhrer-like figure, not these impotent and clueless ayatollahs.“He is the American Alcibiades presiding over the final phase of the American empire.”The conviction that’s crystallizing in me is that his job is to persuade the rubes back home that the USA is still a great power, even hegemon, while it continues to hemorrhage influence, credibility, respect, and raw power abroad, and while various unattended domestic problems — demographic shift, rotting infrastructure, divide in wealth and income, political corruption — continue to fester and eat away at the foundations of the country. I think Orlov was saying a few weeks back that Trump is going to do nothing but he’s going to do nothing with a lot of noise.

        My guess is that Iran got spooked when they saw the awesome power of the US Military on display during the parade last weekend. Most likely they are quietly in communication with Trump trying to deescalate. Expect a peace deal and the dismantling of their nuclear program within the week.

            Interesting to see the Rangers sauntering along like school boys instead of soldiers (in military terms, they were doing a route step, not the usual choice for parades). Lots of people had fun posting videos of Chinese, Russian, and Indian military parades to contrast them with the Sad Sack Washington parade.

            You know it’s a bad sign when you see your government do something and say, “North Korea does it better.” But hey we got to see all the wonderful diversity of our modern military on display, I am sure that Beijing and Moscow called emergency meetings immediately after.

        Israel in an island with limited infrastructure. Iran has precision ballistic missiles that cannot be stopped. In a sane world, Iran would destroy Israel’s refineries and electrical generation stations (they have very few of these) thereby cutting off their energy supply. Hit key equipment and the lead time for repair or replacement is measured in years. This would result in a mass exodus and stop all offensive actions by the IDF. And there would be nothing Trump could do to reverse that.

            Probably Iran is playing kid gloves with Israel just like Russia does with Ukraine.  I think everyone suspects if Israel is subjected to total war by a peer or better the lobby will bring out the real epstein/diddy/franklin files and call in all the favors billions in donations buy in a corrupt town PLUS total media control… and get big brother to launch a general war and then it’s probably doomsday or at least WW3.I’d personally love to see a hypersonic hit the knesset and Ben Mielekowski’s house the first five minutes of a war, but the Js know even in war theyre always protected and never really have to face any consequences of their actions.  Zelensky is still on TV and in public locations every five minutes.

        People want to believe that the cost of America entering the war with Iran is too high and Trump will chicken out. The war is even more obviously insane than before, so no chance. The opposite is true. There are no psychological off ramps here because no one has the needed virtue.Zion Don can be callous and conniving against the Persians, but he will not abandon the Israelis after they painted a target on their backs a la “October 7th”. The favored bet is that Trump’s reluctance to enter the war is a show like the nuclear negotiations were a show, because…The images coming out of Israel are the new 9/11 of today. The instillation and exploitation of trauma that is happening right now is simply masterful. The mass psychosis for the Zionists, Evangelicals, and Israelis is a fait accompli. If certain miscalculations mean that Israel falls before the ground troops show up to silence the missile bases in the heart of a “battered and crumbling” Iran, all the better. Permanent blood feud. For those who would rather doubt as I would rather believe, you can head over to ace.mu.nu to read the room for yourself.Then the Democrat coalition handed Teflon Don a massive favor in the staged LA insurrection and pathetic “No Kings” protests. That gave Trump the excuse to act tough and announce the largest deportations ever from Democrat strongholds from Truth Social on Sunday. He now has all the political capital he needs for the war. No, that was not coordinated. Probably. A symphony of incompetence is still a symphony, that is, the parade was the plan and the Democrats being stupid a predictable bonus. If Trump does not declare war, then Congress will break form and do it for him. The usual suspects own Congress even more than the White House.As for the international scene, Iran will not stop the war until Israel backs down. Israel will not back down because, like every other narcissist, any affront to their will is, or eventually will be, met with violence. Russia will go through the far too slow and inconsequential legal channels in the UN because they were born to make that mistake. My vague sense of the Chinese is that they will not do more than the Russians. The powers that be in America will finish their show of allowing Americans to be sucked into a war with Iran before anything significant comes out of Russia or the UN, and Trump expects Putin to negotiate peace between Israel and Iran like Trump himself managed to negotiate peace between Ukraine and Russia.Finally, the Israeli airstrike on Iran in October, 2024, was a feint to map out the Iranian air defenses for Friday’s operation and lull them into a false sense of security, just as the nuclear negotiations were theater to lull Iran into a false sense of security and con the Americans. Even though an agent was charged, it remains possible that the CIA leaked the details of the October airstrike ahead of time to ensure that the Iranian air defenses were fully operational and therefore mappable rather than to deter Israeli aggression at that time. This is competent more than clever, as this level of warfare has been around for a long time. The point is that you do not have a year long, full spectrum NATO plan to wage war on Iran and allow the US President to back out on stage 3 when Israel is getting hit by missiles, because that is according to plan and the US President almost certainly knows that. I suspect Trump’s demure appearance as of late is a reflection of this.“Sometimes they just need to fight it out.”I will be wrong at some point, but this is the synthesis of all the narratives on the internet combined with a fair reading of history.

            Trump blew a massive opportunity by finking on his base and calling for an end to deportations from farms and hospitals. It’s insane because Trump had all the momentum after the LA riots, people were behind him, yet he backed down. It doesn’t make any sense until you realize that a bunch of big shots from Tyson and Hilton likely called him up, flattered him a little, and he can’t help himself. But now, that momentum is gone and he lost a huge chunk of his base.But, he is who he is. We knew all this going in. As of now I am fully expecting a massive terrorist attack that will be pinned on the Iranians. It might happen soon, or in a year, but there’s no doubt it’s being worked on.

                    Hard disagree, Trump’s political instincts are right and he knows what needs to get done. He just wants to be liked, is very weak to getting buttered up and flattered, and doesn’t like hearing bad news. He thinks that getting rid of illegals is a good thing (he’s right), then the Tyson CEO calls him up and says it’s a bad thing (he’s right, it is bad… for Tyson and only Tyson), then Trump changes tack. it’s just the way he is.For a little while it seemed like he didn’t give a fig about any of that anymore, but it’s clear that’s not the case.

            Excellent post!But I don’t see how the financial powers in the City of London and its hangers-on in NYC and Paris can afford to lose their Israeli attack dog. The State of Israel was established precisely to be their “colonial” outpost in the ME as a platform to project the power of whatever nation-state they wanted to use at a given time to do their bidding. So unless they are prepared to throw in the towel they *must* keep the state of Israel intact, so they are going to have to figure a way to stop what is happening now, or they will lose their ability to project power in the ME, and I don’t see them giving that up by letting Israel go down permanently. They have *got* to find a way to save Israel. And soon. Israel cannot continue much longer.OTOH, the Iranians might *dictate* terms for ending the present mess, which would give them enormous diplomatic and political capital, which they could use in *many* ways, starting with “We saved the Palestinians” and going from there.

            For Project Ukraine, NATO’s only remaining move is to open up a new front against Russia. Any resources that Russia is forced to redirect into Iran is a win and shifts the European sustain of the theater from laughable to plausible.
It would be fitting if Ukraine collapses the moment US Forces directly engage Iran, but Russia is moving too slow for that. Fortune favors the bold when you are betting on entrenched prudence.

        Prediction, and I will take bets:If this ends up a clusterfuck and the Iranian regime survives, which seems more than possible, Israel will segue and step up and finalize the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. Now, I don’t care about any of the Bronze Age savages in the region, starting with the barbarians we call Our Greatest Ally, but the emotionally drenched American women and men who laughably still identify as men generally do. So, in effect, the end result will  be every segment of the generally retarded United States population will end up furious over another grand adventure in the sand.I only care about white safety and survival, and it appears Trump is rapidly moving from a solid “C” to the routine “F” on that score. Utterly predictable and the point when I bray about Orange Man Bad.

        …on the other news, “The American sports betting industry posteda record$13.71 billion in 2024 revenue, up from 2023’srecordof $11.04 billion.”Why do I have the feeling that majority of that activity (not sport! – betting on it!) is performed by that fat soymeatsicle called ‘American white male’?Maybe that variety of bipedals ought to be replaced?

            Watching “sports” on TV is boring, time-consuming, and unhealthy. Betting money on sports makes it even worse. Instead, one should spend one’s hard-earned money on something interesting and worthwhile.

                Eh. Sports dads are more involved with their kids, sports guys are socializing with their friends, sports is a universal language for jocular jousting amongst strangers, and a fun occasion for crowds.
I still feel a bit stupid because I never learned how to read a game, a team, or a stat- I just worked, even as a kid.  Understanding strategy, politics, numbers- it all starts with the adult version of playing with our army men.

                    When I grew up sports was a sorting mechanism to teach teamwork, but also to identify war-worthy young men. There was still a lot of masculine energy in the nation then.
Despite overt sportsmanship, be certain that the local dads viewed local competition as such, and took great pride in the athletic accomplishments of their boys.
That’s what they’d talk about around town, at the golf course, and at the barbershop on Saturday morning.

            The rumor that really needs confirmation is the strike that supposedly hit the oil refinery in Haifa.
That facility supposedly provides 60% of Israel’s fuel needs. Maybe excess shrieking about dragging the US in will be a clue.

                Yep. Shortly after that refinery was hit over 20 aerial tankers took off from bases all around the US at about the same time and headed east across the Atlantic. I doubt that was a coincidence.

        — My guess is that Netanyahu told Trump a eighteen months ago, “We’ll let you get elected if you give us everything that we want, otherwise, you’ll die in jail”.— I have never felt as negatively towards Trump as I do right now— My sense from what I’ve read is that MI6 had more to do with the Russian bomber drone strikes than Americans did— Israel seems to be taking serious and significant damage, but my guess is that Iran is taking it worse (I’m not aware of any Israeli leaders dead so far, for example). Shia capacity for suffering aside, I could see how Iran might want an end soon to all of this.— Many posters on Twitter have been saying Israel has been doing a majority of its damage with in-country sabotage teams (many of them non-Persian) using drones, ATGMs, car bombs, etc more than with jets. It looks like Iranian security services have been tracking those teams down. Hopefully China and Russia are helping Iranian MOIS use machine learning, AI, advanced surveillance, etc to track down and neutralize the sleeper cells (as well as quickly developing better practices for air defense, launcher safety, missile targeting, etc.)— Maybe it’s obvious, but it seems like Israel’s central goal is to turn Iran into another Lebanon, Iraq, Libya, and Syria – a failed state full of warring factions, with a weak central government incapable of power projection.

            No to the security services using AI – Palantir doesn’t need more customer experience – but yes of course to destabilizing the neighbors.  Disrupting the competition’s ability to form a core, or a buffer, is at the very heart of small-state leveraging.

        ‘Trump posted about how negotiations were just a ruse to get the Iranians into a false sense of security, but he changed gears once it was clear the scheme failed’Mixing up tactics and the urge to brag on social media is unnecessary and unwise.It also is unwise to leave the domestic agenda — assuming there is one — for distractions on the other side of the planet. Foreign nations are not going to respect America until it crushes the globohomo and feminist forces, and allied internal enemies of Legacy Americans. And stops sucking from the China Teat and revitalizes its domestic manufacturing.Other countries see America as soft, feminine, and deluded. As a fat doe, limping.Foreign entities and their ruling principalities will not respect America until it deals with its internal enemies and insane agendas. First you clean your own house up. Whether the U.S. ever had the mandate of heaven is debatable, but it is for certain America doesn’t have it now. The world is noticing.Yay! USAID! and then . . . crickets . . .

This level of clumsiness is shocking, even for Israel First Donald.

        They think they can regime change Iran without putting boots on the ground. You’d think they’d have learned something from their efforts to regime change Russia without putting boots on the ground (at least not American ones), but evidently what they learned was that if at first you don’t succeed, try and try again. Maybe they have an Azerbaijani proxy army lined up, for all I know. They just had a practice run in Armenia.

            No doubt we’ll dangle the bait in front of the Kurds again, as well. Kurdistan is currently situated in the northern regions of Syria and Iraq, but Kurds are originally from northern Iran. Turkiye would love to get rid of them, and Armenia/Georgia might welcome the help. “Next year in Tabriz”, perhaps?
Another- the Baluchi in the southeast are acting up again, they even have their own flag.  Azerbaijani hold the north, Arabs have the southwest, Persians hold the center. Is Iran about to get partitioned up, the next Yugoslavia or Pakistan?

        The rumor on Iranian air defense is that AINO staged a cyber attack that was supposed to cripple Iranian AD for a week.Supposedly the Iranian techs had the AD back online in only 10 hours. Not surprising when one realizes these are a people who still have airworthy F-14s with zero manufacturer support.Judging by the sudden lack of strike footage from Tehran, it appears Our Greatest Ally may already be low on munitions. That is another reason to bet on the US jumping in, as is the imminent arrival of a second Nimitz carrier group from the western Pacific.

            The biggest tell for me were the breathless (and false) reports that the Iranian leaders had fled and then…silence. Now there is very little up-to-date information other than carrier groups lumbering from the Western Pacific to the Persian Gulf after a flood of generally positive information from the Israeli standpoint. If it weren’t for X we would know nothing about the direct hits on Tel Aviv over the last few days.
This easily could become American’s Suez Crisis.

        “They also got their air defense system back online and now Israel jets have to operate well outside of their range, which limits what Israel can attack inside Iran.” Outside of an obviously AI generated image, crashed F-35 with its afterburners hilariously still glowing, I haven’t seen any reliable evidence of this. The Iranians, of course, claim to have shot down 7 F-35s, but that seems more like, ghost of Kiev, wishful thinking. Does Israel have air superiority over Iran? I suspect so, but I’ll withhold judgment given that both sides of the media are completely unreliable.

Russia and China cannot afford to let the Israelis or anybody else have their way with Iran. Their own prestige and power are at stake. And they know full well that if Israel/USA prevail, they will be next.

                Bingo! The situation now prevailing can NOT be allowed to run to its logical conclusion–the loss of the Israeli attack dog. Nor do Russia and China any longer have the luxury of staying out of it. And Trump and his handlers can NOT allow a toe-to-toe confrontation with them. They have GOT to stop things SOON.

        Imagine a younger Romney who rouses the nation to a new war, against India, through power of charisma and speech alone. Then he leave on ship to head the armies conquering India.But then come rumors that Mitt ran a Black Mass Satanist dinner in New York. Also, people awaken one day and find that someone defaced the Holocaust Museum and the Lincoln Memorial… rumors spread that it is Mitt Romney in preparation to overthrow the government. So he is recalled from his command to stand trial. Instead of returning, Mitt runs to Russia where he becomes a major advisor to Putin.Soon though, he finally has to leave in a great hurry when it is discovered he’s been banging Putin’s wife in secret. He runs to China where, again, he miraculously becomes a major political force and advisor, adopting Chinese customs and language with ease. After some time he leaves China and ends up living Afghanistan with the tribesmen as one of them, in one of their mud fortresses where he is finally found by American special forces and he goes out fighting, charging them repeatedly with machine gun in his glorious black-and-gold armor and Dune-look headset.Exactly such, and more was the life of the ancient Alcibiades from Athens. How inconceivable! Even as versatile and flashy a man as Trump is very far from this possibility in our time, though he at least makes such a type somehow believable… — fromBronze Age Mindset

        Iran will not attack any Arab state in the Gulf region, nor will it attack their energy infrastructure, and it will not close the Hormuz Strait to oil and gas shipments. The Gulf states are by and large friendly with Iran, and some are co-members of BRICS. Attacking their interests does not advance Iran’s interests, and would actually impair Iran’s interests..However, Iran might block US/NATO naval vessels from transiting the Strait, and it might target US bases in the Gulf region.Likewise, the Houthis, Iranian allies, will not close the Red Sea to Gulf state oil and gas shipments, for the same reason the Iranians won’t close the Strait. The Gulf states are mostly friendly (not SA or UAE).

        I’ve always thought that Trump isn’t in fact the commander in chief and doesn’t make any military (or proxy military) decisions. “America” does what it wants, and he flails to match whatever he thinks it’s doing, to appear to be in charge.He’s completely out of the loop. He finds out what’s happened on the news, which is full of bullshit and bluster, and changes his “orders” to fit that. Whennothingis in the news, he says the kinds of things we prefer, which are his actual positions. But then “we” do some evil shit, and he rushes after it.A possible explanation: Trump thinks that the long-threatened new civil war (mass murder of normal Americans) really kicks off if we find out that electing him didn’t reverse the coup—which I’ll remind us was a televised military siege of the capital. So he’ll take credit/blame foranythingto maintain the illusion.

        Trump is going full Khmer Rouge on Tehran, telling the Iranians to empty the city.Iran lost somewhere between half a million and a million people during its war with Iraq.How many people has it lost over the last 96 hours?  Five hundred?Is the regime stronger now than it was in 1980, or weaker?  Is Persian identity stronger now, or weaker?  What about Shia Islam?None of us know the answer to any of these questions.What I do know is that all this was not worth a three-minute ritual humiliation of Cyril Rhamaposa and fiftysomething White South Africans being allowed to immigrate here.

        “There is no reason to think he will take advantage of the opportunity. It is why the way to bet is on an attack this week.”Although the Democratic PArty is clearly going the way of the old Whig Party, if Trump is stupid enough or Zionist enough to attack Iran openly, the Dems will take control of the whole Congress next year, impeach Trump again, remove him from office, and throw him into prison–maybe even with members of his family. Clearly he has betrayed his voters–first in the Ukraine and now in the Middle East–so he need not look for any support from anybody anywhere if he is stupid enough to attack Iran openly.BUT … IF you are right that Lindsey Graham urges a cease-fire, Trump might be able to use that as an off-ramp to avoid TOTAL disaster. But I’ll believe that Graham favors a cease-fire only when I see it.And then there is Israel’s “Sampson Option,” which I believe they *will* use unless somebody less insane thanGraham and less stupid than Trump manages to put a stop to the  current mess.God help us.

        We should never believe a word Trump utters.
That being said, this strikes me more and more as a NATO-approved war to take out a key Russian ally. The wild card is whether or not Russia will actually get directly involved to assist an important partner. They didn’t help Assad or Armenia, much smaller fry, are they in a position to help Iran without kicking off WW3?

        My prediction is that both Iran and Israel will hit each other really, really hard. But that Iran is more fragile and will face serious revolts on its ability to keep its IRGC payroll intact and enforcers out on the street. Iran will try and blockade the Straits of Hormuz like 1988, and like 1988 will see its navy and much of its oil / military platforms (same thing) destroyed, only at greater cost to the US Navy.Israel probably has greater cohesion, they’ve been attacked by Iran via Hamas on Oct 7 (Iran trained Hamas for this in Iran, which is why Israel missed it); and through the Houthis lobbing missiles at Israel and the last missile exchange.And lets be honest here, and not lie to ourselves. EVERYONE wants this fight. China and Russia want a lab to test out their missiles against the US Navy without risking American nukes. Iran wants this fight to maintain legitimacy against ever increasing internal revolt against their Sopranos type rule. [Capos get everything, Joe Average gets nothing]. Israel wants this to bring the Iranian attacks (Hamas, Hezbollah, and Yemen) to a pause though not an end. The Gulf Monarchies want Iran degraded and weakened. The US wants this to degrade the Iranians ability to threaten the Gulf Monarchies and the oil they pump.Iran is the weaker. It has to pay its secret police and show its “winning” to keep the regime alive. Even if Bibi falls the Israeli regime does not need secret police and enforcers to keep its regime in power. The “moral” part of Israeli legitimacy is “that we are the ones who fight instead of passively accepting our fate.” Fighting against those who repeatedly kill them is the Israeli moral precept for its regime and naturally encourages young Israeli men to support the regime (and Israeli women to oppose it). And given that American’s identity outside of Last Man consumerism is “we are the ones who fight” : Clint Eastwood, Bruce Willis, John Wayne, Charles Bronson, Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Sylvester Stallone (Rocky and Rambo), and even Ahnold did not gain fame and fortune by being Alan Alda. If you want to know why Average Americans like Israelis this is it. They fit into the mode of the Action Heroes they cheered on the screen from say, 1971 to 2019. [Before the Great Awokening deep sixed the Action Hero in favor of the Girl Boss].Israeli men who fight tend to rise in prestige, power, mating opportunities, and the like. Iranian men who do so do NOT get the same payout; as that is restricted to various family members of the Mullahs and IRGC senior people. This is the same issue the Democratic Party faces btw. So that dynamic is in play.

            It’s fascinating to see how David Barnea has unleashed the “Whiskey” BullDog on the goyische skeptics.
My impression is that Whiskey was serving in uniform for a number of months there [s/p October 7th], and that it was only relatively recently that Barnea pulled Whiskey out of active duty, and placedWhiskeyback into Psy-Ops, with a specialty in Demoralization.

        What matters is what Russia thinks: Iran is not only their “fence”, their in-depth land defense of Russia’s southern border, but more importantly it is Russia’s main corridor from the Caspian Sea to the Arabian Sea/Indian Ocean and access to the markets of the Global South.Due to sanctions, Indians broker that Russian oil – and China needs it as well.Netty, I believe, is trying to regime change Iran so he can get a footprint on the Hormuz Strait, as well as a lock on the Red Sea and Gaza-Cyprus offshore gas. Israel’s economic power would stand in for the population power they lack: avirtualEretz Ysrael, rather than one defined by borders.We are seeing a balance-of-power act between 5 countries that are similar in size and population: Egypt, Turkey, Arabia, Iran, with the British/US Outpost as “fifth”. Dimona meant their conflicts had to go covert and proxy, due to MAD; the CIA-MI6 got involved because Gamel Nasser’s attempt at a pan-Arab Union had Soviet support.Putin has offered to process Iran’s nuclear material, keeping it at 20% enrichment for peaceful purposes within IAEA guidelines rather than the 60%, one step below weapons grade, that Iran jumped to.Iran’s mullahs didn’t have to spend their scarce resources on war, Israel didn’t have to destabilize her neighbors with neocon wars, both since 1979. If Israel “liberates” Iran and returns the Shah’s son to the Peacock Throne, I would welcome the Powers erasing their mistake. The Shah’s granddaughter has married a American Jew, so a stabilizing satrapy is in the works.p.s.- why don’t the neighbors want the Palestinians? Because then they’d be letting Israel throw its trash in their yard. They’d lose face to Israel, and are afraid the Pali’s will be used as a fifth column as well as a strain on resources. Bibi said his ethnic cleansing is only temporary, hinting at a right of return. LOL. Bibi claims Hamas has booby-trapped every building, so they need to level the buildings and move the population until they can rebuild.Actually, I can see that. Israel violated the old Ottoman landholder’s rights, called Mulk and Miri. (European farming methods didn’t work in the Levant- Arab farmers produced 87% of the crops for export, similar to our South.) If they can harvest the Palestinians as indentured labor- aka slaves- they might do it. It would be a repeat of what the Lords did in Ireland under the Corn Laws.

                I have believed ever since 2016 that it is not possible to “make American great again,” and if it were, Trump would hardly be the person to do it.
That being said I did vote for him three times. No matter how bad Trump is, he has the right enemies and remains preferable to Hillary or Kamala.

                    Trump’s career in high politics thus far has (1) moved the Overton Window, (2) exposed the blob, (3) discredited the legacy media, and (4) driven millions of NPCs batshit insane. By my count that gives Trump more accomplishments than any other GOP president in my lifetime.

                        We shouldn’t hang our heads because we voted repeatedly for this guy. I mean look at what has been on offer over the decades since Reagan… Bush I, Dole, Bush II, McCain, Romney, Yeb, Nikki Haley, Chris Chistie. From “our team”. And then contemplate, in a kind of awe, the loserporn the Dems have been subjecting us to in the same period: Dukakis, Clinton, Gore were bad enough, but then – Kerry, Soetero, the drunken murderess whose name I forget, Brandon, and finally, the piece de resistance of repulsiveness, Veep Throat.OK, so maybe we should have all gotten on board with Ted Cruz in 2016? DeSantis in 2024? It is to laugh. The Donald is and has been the only logical choice over these last nine years for those of us convinced that the system is the problem, and that it must be overturned. If sheer chaos is what is required, then Donald is and has been the only candidate “up for the job”. He doesn’t know what he’s doing, any more than a seven-year-old at the control panel of a nuclear reactor. And that’s exactly what we’ve all been rooting for, right?

        Just a theory I’ve been kicking around on Trump, curious to see what people here think. Is it possible he’s ceded foreign policy to the neocons in order to get their blessings/support on his domestic agenda? They are dug in throughout Washington, and a deal like that could have been promised to make sure it happens. It would explain somewhat why things look so disjointed from the outside.

                Well that’s easy, your supposition assumes Trump has no power at all. He clearly does hold power, as do the neocons. He has the power to not move on any of their foreign escapades, but then they have the power to dig their heels in on everything on the domestic front. In my scenario, the neocons get their main itch scratched, which is killing innocent people around the world, and Trump gets his domestic agenda passed, which is clearly his main concern. Listen, if I’m right, then we’ll see him continue the Ukraine project and start a war with the Iranians, while also getting his BBB legislation through. Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely don’t want these foreign escapades, but if you told me I had to swallow continued support for Ukraine, but the border wall is built and millions of immigrants are deported out of our communities, I’ll take that deal.

        I am more cautiously optimistic.The US can supply Ukraine or Israel, but not both. Already Zelensky is panicking, saying that Russia is the real threat to Israel or somesuch. The best path for peace is Russia solving Ukraine militarily — advancing to Lvov, deposing Zelensky, deporting the remnant Ukrainians to Poland (to destabilize that nation), and sponsoring/encouraging a series of Islamist coups NOW in the UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden etc.Thus the no-trust “deal” would be the US and Russia divying up Europe just like before.Diverting US support from Ukraine to Israel is thus the better available paths to lesser risk of global nuclear war.Trump did not “blow it” because there was nothing to blow. Neither Xi nor Putin nor the Mullahs would ever deal with him as it is clear that the next President (Hakeem Jeffries likely) will simply tear up whatever deal was done and make their own deal. That is the Obama legacy.Yes like JFK with the Bay of Pigs, Trump is weak in that lower level CIA people cook up crazy schemes and run them with no notification, see also Truman, Ike, etc. Nothing new there.I think people are forgetting the nearly uninterrupted hostilities between the US and Iran dating back to 1979. The moral argument Iran’s Mullahs have to “why do you rule” is that they lead JIHAD against both the Great and Little Satans. Iran mined the Gulf in 1988, and blockaded the Straits of Hormuz. In response, Reagan sank the Iranian navy and destroyed several drilling/military platforms in Operation Preying Mantis. The US and Iran have been fighting each other since the Hostage Crisis, over mostly the Gulf not Israel. Though Iran remains committed to destroying Israel as a sign of its moral purity in contrast to the accomodationist Gulf Monarchies.As long as this remains the War of the Missiles, it is the least worst of the paths available to Trump. Iran’s regime has fought the Saudis for about 20 years now, hitting their oil fields from Yemen, fighting a dirty proxy war in Yemen with missiles hitting Saudi cities and the Saudis bombing Yemen. Iran’s regime really only HAS Jihad as the moral argument for their rule; and their population is now vastly more urban, educated, feminist, and anti-regime than 1988. If Iranians cannot get fuel, water, food, they can’t just survive as they could in mostly rural 1988 Iran. And against China and Russia, Iran has regional enemies Turkey and the Saudis and Gulf Monarchies absent Qatar. Iran has as its mission the goal of overthowring the Sunni monarchies which oppress the sizeable Shia population in their nations.Thus one should ask, “how are the Israelis getting to Iran with planes and missiles ?” Answer, the Gulf monarchies and Jordan are cooperating as Iran is a threat to them as well, and the Gulf countries provide a lot of money and other benefits to the Trump Admin. There was a big Gulf meeting with Trump and the monarchs a few months ago, no doubt this was discussed.Iran’s and Russia’s advisers in Yemen were able to shoot and scoot into the Yemeni mountains against the US Navy, Southern Iran is mostly flat and while they can scoot after shooting the US is likely to be able to hit them as well.There is however zero chance of eliminating Iran’s nuclear program. I would rate US ground troops in Iran at less than 1%. It is however a “laboratory” for the US, China, Russia etc. to see what an invasion of Taiwan would look like as far as how good are the Russian/Iranian/Chinese missiles and how good is the US Navy.Takeaway: the “War” is mostly driven by Iranian expansion threatening the Gulf Monarchies and the US as guarantor of their security for oil. The balance of power may have shifted to Iran given advances in missile technology but every tool has a counter.The good news is this means winding down Project Ukraine in favor of Project Iran. So there is that.

        This post reminded meofbeing in the USSR in 1967.
For the first 4 daysof the 6Days Warthe Soviet press, radio and TV claimed that the armies of several Arab countries are on the way to great victory over Israel.
WSJtoday:﻿“Iran sends urgent messages seeking an end to hostilities and resumption of talks”.
In this messages words like “Zionist entity” are not used anymore. “Israel” is used instead.

        The British Crown controls Iran as an on-command “sabre rattler.”This along with the same type of satrapy in China, North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela, Ukraine, South Africa, and even the “state of Israel,” previously known as “the British Mandate in Palestine.This is the hidden crypto-colonial British Empire of today. So called “forever wars” result from the crypto-administration of the colonial policy: regime change.Until the head of the snake is removed, that of the European royals and their specifically Roman Crown, it will continue.There will be no modicum of peace until all those people in succession of hereditary monarchy are absolutely exterminated and thus deprived of their perennial Throne of Nimrod, their Great Whore of Babylon.The filthy royals don’t want you knowing this fact. They own all the land (latifundia) in Dominion, and you are their livestock.

                Cecil Rhodes called it the Anglo-American Empire.
We fought a British King 250 years ago to not be serfs in a Crown Colony.
They came back in control as a “Special Relationship.”
And here we are with a King enthroned in Canada to our north.
Prince Harry needs to be arrested as a Spy and put to death by the US Military.
He personally arranged for at least one assassination attempt on President Trump.

        An attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities is a repeat of what Zelenskyy tried in Zaporozhiye:Bibi is trying to cause a Chernobyl,all while claiming Iran will nuke Gaza (west Jerusalem) to save Gaza.We may have a case of two religious zealots in competiton: Smotrich, when he’s not selling sex toys, trying to bring the Mosiach (not Jesus!), and Khameini, when he’s not schtupping little boys, trying to bring the Mahdi (also not Jesus.)Somebody noted the primary colors oft used in Muslim nations’ flags are Red, White, Black, and Green- the colors of the Four Horsemen, the first four Seals to be broken.

        Off topic but been on my mind–Is religion actually just a form of OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder)? If a Jew eats a bacon cheeseburger for lunch, will the sun really fall out of the sky? If a Muslim fails to kneel towards Mecca 5 times a day will his family be stoned and denied their 72 virgins? If a person willingly injects themselves and their family members with poison several times a year will it keep the demons at bay? To me, religious fervor is like having to flip the porch light on and off exactly 4 times before leaving the house otherwise something terrible will happen and only I can stop it from happening by exercising my belief. Most people just want to be liked and included and cannot stand up to being shunned or mocked. Only an outlier or an independent thinker will evaluate and question the data and say No I don’t think I will do that. Religion is that crutch people use to get to stay inside the herd. The road less traveled is also less comfortable but the view at the end is splendid. Think for yourself-think hard.

        The response from Iran has been pathetically muted so far.There is a real possibility that a decapitating strike did – or will – work.Which would be great if it does.  Iran’s regime is no friend of America, or American people.  Or even of the Persian people. That regime did waste a lot of the country’s resources stirring up shit around the middle east.  They are a regional caricature  of the GAE.  So good riddance if they are gone.The real threat here is hubris leading the GAE to believe it can occupy and nation build Iran. Hopefully Trump prevents that from happening,  We’ll have to wait and see.
