        Besides being irresponsibly dangerous (wars always escalate) any conflict with Russia makes no sense from a practical strategic point of view.  What if it turns out our invisible planes aren‚Äôt?  The Japanese, Saudis, Israelis, Germans everyone suddenly feels naked.  Our air force isn‚Äôt what they assumed.  That would start a cascade that would destroy the American Empire right there and that‚Äôs the best case scenario.  Our DOD and defense contractors have to know all this?

        hey Z man,ton of comments here, interesting stuff.   my .02 on this?  Well, if I go by two concepts, Occam‚Äôs Razor &amp; Cui Bono, I would say that a war between US &amp; Russia benefits China the most.   They break the island chain to seaward and walk into Siberia.That‚Äôs the Cui Bono part.   For Occam Razor, the above suggestion is supported by the thing which we all suppose is there and true, but which we never hear about, not one peep, in this Euro context.  Oor foreign policy elites, our State department, is compromised by China ‚Äî and the Chinese understand that the best way to keep those traitors working for them is to have them stirring up shit like US v Rus.that is all‚Ä¶ roger, Out.the JG

        We have 13% of the population dictating our domestic policy. Republicans need to do a better job shoring up the white vote, and making a real play for the Mexican-American vote, where they are making inroads. That way we can all tell the 13% to go fuck themselves.

            Are you retarded? Since when do Republicans do anything for whites? Now wonder the US is descending towards South Africa, when white Americans keep trying the same failed thing over and over again.

        And in other news.Police put down a 15 year old female who was brandishing a knife in Ohio. The comments are hilarious. ‚ÄúShe was only fighting with another girl, she wasn‚Äôt threatening the cop!‚Äù‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt they tase her?‚Äù
White police officers need to pull out of vibrant areas ASAP, or they will be subject to regular ass reaming.

        Mob rule is officially here. Everyone here knows there that there was at least one juror that didn‚Äôt agree on all charges given the evidence of the circumstances. However, they knew that if they didn‚Äôt go along, the media would have doxed them. Their homes would have been razed by the mob, they would have been fired, and they would have had to flee the country for the safety of their family. This is America 2021.

            The reason this goes on is the Right is now part of the Left.Let me explain, they value the individual or at most the nuclear family above all else and at its core that is a Leftist value.Conservatives value Tradition and  the Community good not in the  fake virtue signaling way  the Left does to convince people to join the mob but in the real way.Public order, civic participation, be moral ,break the rules face the consequences.Its seems like the Right abandoned morality for money and the idiotic notion that Conservatism is an attitude,No its not, its policy enforced by law and by community standards.Its the notion that if you sell drugs, we‚Äôll hang you in public  for harming the community.Its the Amish notion that if you can‚Äôt live by Amish rules, leave and we will have  nothing to do with you.Its tradition, we do these things, allow these things, forbid these things because that is who we are and Gods help you if you try and change them without a damned good reasonOnce we dumped  the social conservatives, the anti abortion people and  the paleocons for ‚Äúreformed‚Äù  Trostskyite Neo Cons  Cheap Labor Globalists and Country Clubbers the people that would check the Left were  now just part of it.Until the Right becomes actually Right and learns to organize to a common set of moral and social principles rapidly expelling any easy street grifters  , globalists and money boys they‚Äôll lose every fightBest case is collapse or chaos.Join or Die.Now as for this injustice, any police in any large city especially Minneapolis that doesn‚Äôt feel like the system will  give them a fair trial or protect them from a mob and who isn‚Äôt super close to retirement ought to quit.No police, no problem. Understand the people in charge don‚Äôt care. They are as oblivious as Marie Antoinette but enough of the people that keeping voting in idiots may get the message to not do that. Maybe,If they don‚Äôt? So be it. Unless the Right is actually willing to embrace authority and use it , the US is doomed anyway. Just build a resilient small community somewhere and enjoy life as best you can.

                abprosper:  Fascinating, must read article at Couhter-Currents today by Nicholas Jeelvy, describing why normie conservatives literally cannot, neurologically, not work within the system.  There is no betrayal the left could perform that would allow the conservative personality to accept the violence and chaos that would naturally occur by responding in kind.  Those that can be redpilled have been redpilled.  You fight with the army you have.

                Good comment Prospier.  A bit disjointed, but we all get that way don‚Äôt we.  Only problem I have with your comment is that cops are working-class guys just trying to make a living.  You‚Äôre asking them to quit.   I don‚Äôt like them having to be just another jobless victim of the system.  Guys need an income.

                    Good thing lots of places are hiring.
More seriously, if cops quit en masse, they could simply start private security firms and provide private security to ritzy neighborhoods. This isn‚Äôt that far fetched, as cops do this anyway, at least in large cities, once they get their pension.

        Guilty on all charges. Sick sick sick. But this was the perfect mirror of the O J Simpson trial. Black O J did kill (two) whites and got ‚Äònot guilty‚Äô. White Chauvin (probably) did not kill Floyd and got ‚Äòguilty‚Äô. Only way in which where these two cases are the same and not mirror images, is miscarriage of justice. On ‚Äòthe system failed‚Äô they are very much the same. Now watching the scum celebrating live on TV. To hell with this, to hell with it.

                Without ideology there is no common goal and nothing for leaders to do.Ideology is everything.Now leaders need to be  incredibly  smart, charismatic   that can‚Äôt be subverted or threatened and have a good sized power base to resist the permanent government are essential.President Trump tried but he was easily outmatched as he was lacking.Men like that are rare though and it its best to assume they aren‚Äôt there. Build local resilient communities , get off the grid when you can and just let the system do what its going to do.With reproductive rates he way they are  in less time than from now to the War of 1812 much of  the former US will be many nations, many  Christian, White and Agrarian.Amish Paradise will never go to the moon but they‚Äôll live moral if dull lives which is good enough.

                    Yes the midterms. A couple of governorships also and we will be primed to make a good showing in 2024.
This will be our decade I tell you. Ben Shapiro‚Äôs insights and leadership will be instrumental in all of this. Once we get this country back, firstly, tax breaks.Secondly, conservative people of color into high positions. We will show them.Finally we move to a more inclusive dialog with our mid-east adversaries. With Israel‚Äôs help that will cement Republican leadership for this country for decades.

                    We just need a couple more based black guys on Fox News telling people how the democrats are the real racists and that will fix everything. Before you know it, everyone will embrace the ‚Äúlegacy of Dr. Martin Luther King‚Äù and racism will be a thing of the past.Our 1.2 children will one day take a trip to Washington DC to see statues of Charlie Kirk and Ben Shapiro erected next to the statue of St. George Floyd, who like Dr. King would be a republican if he were alive today. The inscription at the bottom will read, ‚ÄúRace doesn‚Äôt matter. Ideology does.‚Äù Little black children will then sing hymns to the sacred constitution and recite the words for former slaveholders like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson ‚Äî now that race is a thing of the past and no one ever thinks about that anymore, least of all African-Americans.The democrats may seem to be on a winning streak with this mass immigration, total control of the media, and full spectrum persecution of their enemies. But just you wait. That silent majority is going to show up in the polls any time now. Virginia and Georgia are going back to being red states and California, too! Woo hoo. Trust the plan. So say we all.

            This verdict will cause a sea change in policing across the country.
As Sailer predicted, we have entered the time when a black can only be arrested if he really feels like being arrested.

                What goes through the midwit normie mind:That‚Äôs impossible. Stephen Pinker said the future was going to be great, that all we had to do was continue what we had already been doing. And he works at HARVARD. The New York Times agrees. So, obviously that can‚Äôt happen. Stephen Colbert and Seth Myers also say everything is the fault of the GOP ‚Äî everything. My TV says blacks are hunted down by evil cops. Put it all together, and I don‚Äôt know what it means, but since I believe everything I hear, I‚Äôll just wait for the next Jordan Peele movie to tell me what I should think about all of this.

        War with Russia is the most insane act conceivable. While I haven‚Äôt had time to comment much I still read this blog and it seems true that we don‚Äôt actually know who‚Äôs calling the foreign policy shots in Washington. Considering that they are aggressively picking a fight with 5000 thermonuclear weapons that is actually rather scary. Russia could rip the continental United States to shreds if push came to shove. It is about as smart as jumping into a pit with a man-eating tiger swinging your razor sharp, glinting samurai sword. Sure, the tiger will probably die if you know how to use that thing. But, probably so would you.P.S. Just heard the jury is back in the Chauvin case and just saw Z‚Äôs comment on gab via WRSA. I think Chauvin will be put away. The jury is blacks and (presumably, given Minneapolis‚Äô reputation) rather woke whites. They are not the place to look if you‚Äôre searching for ppl ready to do right come hell or high water. I think he will be convicted, possibly even of 2nd degree murder. I think a not guilty verdict would be the right one. If I‚Äôm wrong and they return ‚Äònot guilty‚Äô, honker down and stay away from crowds. So tired of this nonsense. Stay safe guys.

Very true. I hope for a not guilty. But the police are the ones who would haul dissidents or their computers and drives and cell phones or guns, away. When it is no longer a free country, all sorts of unfamiliar things to take into consideration.

        I think you also overlooked the fact that the Russians have worked out a practical alliance with the Chinese. Russia has supplied China with weaponry in recent years and they‚Äôve held joint exercises. The Chinese are opportunists. If the US got in a shooting war with Russia over Crimea, I think it would be highly probable that they would use it as an opportunity to finally take Taiwan with the empire spread thin. Such a move against Russia would be beyond foolish. We‚Äôd be talking about a potential WW3.

        Z-Man, nice piece but I take issue with the military angle. First, I think war is highly likely because initially it would succeed wildly. No nation has ever had a solution to American Air Power. Since the Gulf War, Serbia, Iraq War, Libya, Syria, and various Israeli vs. Hezbollah &amp; Iran actions/wars, American style air power has been supreme over anything Russian.Russian pilot training is a joke, very limited. Their airplanes are old, avionics inferior, and air defense systems easily destroyed in every single engagement. There is no reason to think given war that Russian air forces would not be wiped out in a day or two, air defenses a few days longer, and armored forces destroyed as in Syria a few years back. Even the Turks splashed Russian airplanes and had no comeback. The US could roll forward like a juggernaut ‚Äî UNTIL ‚Ä¶Dug in infantry and artillery. Which the US since Tarawa and Saipan have had no good answer for. Israel suffered fairly major (for them) casaulties against Hezbollah in their latest war, dug in troops with artillery and anti-tank weapons took a heavy toll. I think the US military is mostly behind this ‚Äî the colonels want to be generals and one star generals want another star. Big Army and the Air Force have been left out in the War on Terror Special Forces Olympics and want action. They know they can succeed initially very well and simply are ignoring the danger from dug in forces.My guess is that it happens, gets bogged down in the Donbass, the Turks try an amphibious landing in Crimea and suffer their own Gallipoli, turn to Greece and the Balkans with US blessing, and someone in the US Army pivots and goes for Moscow ‚Äúto settle the matter‚Äù and Putin goes tactical nuclear. Where it goes from there is anyone‚Äôs guess. There might also be a SEAL or Spec Ops team sent to Moscow to kidnap/kill Putin, he‚Äôs unlikely to be there of course.As for motivation, its mostly a group as you noted looking to loot Russia, the usual Wall Street suspects, along with gay/tranny people. The Pritzkers, etc. There is nothing more beserker than Tranny rage. Putin has limited gay/tranny depravity so he‚Äôs target #1. The Military wants action of course. And there are the great gamers angry at Russian help with Iran in Syria who also want (????) and Iranian nuclear arms deal (again ????) Yeah I know $$$$ but still.ALSO, War with Russia will be the excuse for the re-ordering of society that the Ruling Class has wanted since Bill Ayers. Camps for White people, with soldiers/sailors/marines told they must fight utmost for their family back home to get food (or not). The camps of course will never go away, at least that is the plan. War with Russia, the FBI/National Guard mobilized to round up White people with various Fed agencies in tow, a dead certainty and another major motivation. ‚ÄúRussian subversion‚Äù will be the fig leaf.One thing to note, Team Biden has threatened Israel over its actions sabotaging the Iran Deal. For some ($$$$$) reason the Biden Deep State has a total raging hard on for that deal, it would not shock me to see the SEALs sent to Israel to abduct Netanyahu and his cabinet and transfer them to Iran for execution just to send Israel‚Äôs military a message. People in Biden‚Äôs Admin seem that invested. Spec Ops seems to be the magic elixir for the Deep State these days.It seems power is fragmented into several different camps and this makes IMHO war more rather than less likely. As the Military and CIA can just act with no real president to stop them.

            Russia‚Äôs air force did pretty well too in Syria. And the US air force has not faced post 1990s Russian air tech. Everyone‚Äôs talking about the Russian S-400 air to air missiles and the SU-30 and 35 fighters are pretty good. The Indian air force uses the SU-30 and they often beat F-15s in mock air battles in joint exercises. I don‚Äôt think the US will own the skies uncontested over Eastern Ukraine if ppl with more authority than brains are crazy enough to find out empirically.

            They cannot beat the US but the US can certainly lose a war.Any war the US wins against Russia too far into their territory  will result in a nukes being used  , not against CONUS at first but anyone stupid enough to base our aircraft or our carriers.They may also have hyperbaric missiles and other nasty tech capable of hurting us.The US hasn‚Äôt lost many planes to the foes we‚Äôve fought but I‚Äôll note that the Taliban destroyed more Marine aircraft in a ground op than the anyone else since WW2We share a border with  Russia and  unlike basically most any other nation can sneak people in easily and create untold havoc. Including killing pilots at home.They can also flood the US and Mexico  with arms as an option.$50 AKM and Makarov pistol. $200 for an RPGUltimately if the Russian Airforce isn‚Äôt up to the job Russia has asymmetrical options galore and a final doomsday option as well.

            Question: will white males in the military be willing to fight and die against the Russians on behalf of an Alzheimer‚Äôs patient and his racist ‚Äúyeah, but white‚Äù VP, sec of defense, and the columnists of the Washington Post &amp; MSNBC, the network that wanted to use drones on republicans here in America? Would you die on behalf of this country after all it has done against our people? Maybe there would be a mutiny. Didn‚Äôt the military already recall those ships headed to the Black Sea? Looked to me like somebody was overruled. Maybe Z‚Äôs idea of Biden not being fully in control is correct. Biden was forced to settle for sanctions when the military told him to take a hike. Maybe that‚Äôs not a bad thing.

Or are they ‚Äújust simple soldiers‚Äù and do what they‚Äôre told, even if it‚Äôs intended as a joke? As much as I hate (for much more than a mere Two Minutes) this regime, and as much as I respect (not admire) Putin, I won‚Äôt cheer on Mother Russia, and I hope that war can be avoided; The Ukraine is not worth a single paratrooper, let alone that of the proverbial Pomeranian Grenadier.

        Z;Don‚Äôt understand why nobody‚Äôs talking about the most obvious beneficiary of any US ‚Äì Russia conflict: *China*.China has lots of people and few natural resources in a constricted (for that many people) geography.  Russia has few people, lots of natural resources and a vast geography right next door.  Siberia‚Äôs not going to strip-mine itself to send resources to keep those Chinese factories going, now is it.And we know China has Kompromat on *a lot* of our Swamp.  And we know China has ‚Äòunredeemed‚Äô Han just off their coast that the CCP has staked a good bit of its claim to the Mandate of Heaven in redeeming by any means possible.  And we know that causing the foreign devils to fight among themselves for the benefit of the Middle Kingdom has been a Chinese strategic staple for &gt; 3,000 years.Compared to these solid interests, a thirst for revenge by the tiny hat folk for affronts committed 200 years ago seems a bit ephemeral by comparison, don‚Äôt you think_?

            Quite so. 20 years ago China had maps showing Siberia and Khazakstan (Baikanour) as Chinese provinces.  Lebenstraum makes sense, and the Mongoloid race is made for the cold.The question then becomes, is the Ukraine feint an attempt to pull Russia into a two-front war? A western front diverting military resources from an eastern advance?(Speaking of long memories, Vladistovok used to have a Chinese name, and until 740, China‚Äôs dominion extended to Turkish borders.On the other hand, the Rus remember the brutal Golden Horde, Mongol occupation, which made them the right mean b*stards they are.Me, I‚Äôd say the race war goes back to the Scythians and beyond- the white stock from whence the Uyghers come.  It appears to me that two peoples with much the same chracteristics- including resentment of white invaders- have found a mutual interest.)

            By ‚Äútiny hat folks‚Äù you mean Jews but your summary completely misunderstands post diaspora Jewish history. Compared with Ukraine, yes Ukraine, Jews did not have much problem with Russia and/or Russians nor with Poland/Poles back then. The Khmelnitzky riot/uprising/revolution in the 17th Century (see for some details inhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmelnytsky_Uprising) was probably the greatest catastrophe in Jewish history before WWII, and pogroms were quite common in the following centuries in Ukraine/Belarus.It is a mystery why ‚Äúliberal‚Äù political Jews have also completely turned against Russia in recent years but whatever the cause of that turn was it could not be historic reasons despite what the commenters in this blog believe. I for one would like to hear a rational explanation but I do not believe that neo-cons like Frum, Boot or Kristol, etc., are motivated by hatred of Russia for any historical reasons. My explanation is simpler, to quote the indomitable spirit of Bobbi Flekman ‚ÄúMoney talks, bullshit walks‚Äù and the PRC has money, furthermore, it is a clear political advantage for the Chinese to make America hate Russia.Of course, one may legitimately think that it is a deep psychological problem for former Trotskyites or Stalinists but also lovers of Soviet Russia that is the underlying idiocy here compensating for a self-hate that one might feel for having supported such a murderous regime.

                Ton;An amazing read that I knew almost nothing about_!  Thanks.  Obviously in retrospect, when world history was actually taught before Big U went Poz, it was very much W European centered.
As to whether the events in Ukraine of 350 years ago matter to today‚Äôs motivations, I guess it matters if enough of the tiny hats think they do, regardless.  In a sane world, they‚Äôd be told to get over it, if it were really true that they think this and that they run things here.  Smdh.

        I think it is pretty obvious that the US empire would lose the war with Russia. Transgender sergeants just don‚Äôt command the respect of real men, and women just can‚Äôt cut the mustard. But, the elite have to know this as well. So, we have to ask: Why do they want us to lose this war? The answer is the same as why they‚Äôre pushing the pandemic lie. It‚Äôs about destroying all resistance in this country. This will determine if Americans have any backbone left. Given the past 4 years, the sheep-like response to giving up freedoms for safety, and the obvious stealing of the presidential election have pretty much already answered this. We‚Äôll all be Lagos, soon.

            A W Male;I‚Äôm not sure that the Cloud Folk of today actually *do*realize (or care) how much they‚Äôve weakened the US Military of late.
In my interactions with normies, even un-woke ones, it‚Äôs like Scott Adams says: ‚ÄúOne screen, two movies.‚Äù   That is, they have so convinced themselves of their worldview, that this is looked on as improvement.  After all, the Universities are doing just fine and are really much better now, so why would it be different with the US Military.  And the top brass has assured them that it‚Äôs all good.

            We would probably win at least at first. Russian air defenses have been obliterated in every conflict US Airpower or allies have fought in since the early 1950s. That has not changed at all.There was a Russian armored column in Syria ‚Äúaccidentally on purpose‚Äù destroyed by a couple of US jets a few years ago. That sort of thing would happen repeatedly in the Donbass and in Crimea.After Russian jets and air defense missiles are wiped out in a day or two, any armor would be destroyed. If it tried to move during the day, at night, or even just stayed put it would be destroyed like Saddam‚Äôs forces.Where it gets dicey is advancing on enemies who spent the last few years digging in with concrete and mines and artillery and machine guns interlocked and prepared. Those can be taken but it would be heavy cost, like the Hedgerows before Patton‚Äôs breakout to the West. And the temptation would be to break away, go to Moscow to break the stalemate. We don‚Äôt have a massive conscript army any more and heavy casualties means the combat effectiveness of the US Army degrades rapidly. That is what happened to the Wehrmacht in 1941. By early 1942 they had lost so many experienced soldiers even as they advanced that they had half the combat effectiveness they did a year prior, which explains their serial failures in the East. They just did not have enough skilled manpower to successfully attack (and Soviet tactics and counter-offensives got a lot better over time). Combat Infantry attacking requires high skills. Defense far less so as the Israelis found out in Lebanon against Hezbollah and the Iranians. So the temptation to break out and fight a war of maneuver favoring US strengths would be nearly irresistible for the US Army as its irreplaceable manpower gets bled away against dug in conscripts.At that point I think Putin at least unleashes tactical nukes which he certainly has.Is our leadership willing to engage in total nuclear war annihilating most US cities to get Putin? My guess is no, but its only a guess. The Woke Military in Lloyd Austin could easily decide to go for it. Who would stop him? The situation is filled with danger.Hopefully other power centers in the Deep State will pull back from war.

                ‚ÄúWe would probably win at least at first. Russian air defenses have been obliterated in every conflict US Airpower or allies have fought in since the early 1950s. That has not changed at all.‚ÄùActually, it has changed, and there are a number of reasons. The quality of equipment has declined and has not been updated for several years. Russia has upgraded their equipment, in the meantime. Most of the personnel in the Armed Forces now are only in it for training and a paycheck. They have no loyalty to DC. The distance between the Ukraine and the United States is one of the reasons you ‚Äúnever engage in a land war in Asia‚Äù. Supply lines have to be overextended and easily sabotaged. Europe may pay lip service to US ambitions, but they hate us and won‚Äôt provide anymore help than they have to. Some may even tell Biden to go f*ck himself. Don‚Äôt forget, we are also placing men and supplies in position to engage China, so a two front war is possible, three if you count the Islamic Middle East. Germany had the best military in the world in 1939 but trying to take on war on three fronts was an impossibility, and will prove to be for the US. America is not what it was in 2001, much less 1950.

                    The border issue is weird. Alaska is very close to Russia but that region is inhospitable.
Its 34 Fahrenheit right now in April so its rough going for aircraft. We  used to have an airbase   there called Marks Field but its long gone so we come in a bit behind. Russia is better at large scale cold weather ops though we are about equal in spec forces
Also Europe may not allow us to base our aircraft there for fear of retaliation.
A war would get really weird really fast.

                No, Whiskey, your sense of the combat readiness and competence of Russia‚Äôs aerospatial forces is way, way off. With the rapid advances of recent years in fighters (pointed out by another poster who referred to how the Indian AF, flying contemporary Russian fighters, whipped the US forces asses in joint exercises‚Ä¶hmm), air defenses with their spectrum of missiles from Pantsirs to S-400s, phased array radar systems both on their aircraft, as well as their AD systems, and their recent extensive experience in ground attack in coordination with ground forces in Syria, does not augur well for the US forces should things get jiggy.That Russian armored column of which you spoke was a column of Russian military contractors, not the Russian military. Big difference in capabilities and equipment. The US was supposed to coordinate military actions with the Russian/Syrian forces, but they did not in that incidence. And you wonder why the Russians consider the US to be totally ‚Äúnon-agreement capable‚Äù? They know the US diplomatic and military command structure to be composed of liars to a very high degree. They didn‚Äôt like it, but the situation demanded restraint; but God help US forces if that imposed restraint is removed.The Turkish ‚Äúsplash‚Äù of a Russian ground attack aircraft was a carefully laid ambush by the border executed while the Russian craft was tightly manuevering to avoid crossing into Turkish airspace. Whether they had actually, for a few seconds, violated their airspace, is not even certain, but the attack was a scurilous, cowardly act. Russia cut all tourist travel to Turkey and trade, and Erdogan came crawling in short order, as Turkey was being bled white. When the Syrians and Russians were attacking jihadis in the north later, the Turks set up ‚Äúobserver positions‚Äù there, basically to shield their jihadi pals, but these positions were quickly made nonviable (i.e., nonsurvivable) when fire rained down danger close, and any and all resupply was cut off.If the US/NATO gets into it with the Russians over their ‚Äúnear abroad‚Äù, the rear echelon motherfuckers will find themselves in the front echelons, as cruise missile attacks on supply dumps and follow-on forces will be done by non-nuclear munitions and/or nasty, lingering submunitions. Trench warfare it will not be. And what leads you to believe that military GPS satellites, upon which so many offensive capabilities of US/NATO forces depend, will not be shot down. And if the US lobs anything into Russian territory, any launch facilities to replace destroyed GPS satellites will be history.These are not third world ragheads with beatup Kalashnikovs here. The Russians do not want war, but if the US littlehats want to throw some shitfit over some, likely apocryphal, supposed incidents involving their greatgrandfather in the Russian Empire days,  the war will land on their doorstep, no matter where they are, US, Europe, Israel. The shotcallers will not be safe. Good.

They‚Äôre evil, but not stupid. Look at what they have accomplished. They completely control the economy and make it stop or start at their command. They offed JFK almost 60 years ago and got away with it. They‚Äôre even more entrenched now. Why just last November they stole the presidential election in broad daylight, AND GOT AWAY WITH IT! No, none of them believe in the liberal agenda. Its just a useful tool to gain and retain power. And frankly, I don‚Äôt believe that people like Biden or Pelosi believe any of that nonsense, either. They‚Äôre just given the script and go with it. Now, there are some useful idiots that believe in Climatology, Cancel Culture, and Institutionalized Racism, but they‚Äôre just the shock troops and loud mouths that follow victimology because they want to be on the winning side.

        Actually, you somewhat hit on the truth with that previous post on Covid.  The empire needs and external enemy and it‚Äôs a huge bonus if that enemy is white.

        Treaty obligations or not, it‚Äôs hard to imagine the US getting into a war with Russia over the Ukraine, or with China over Taiwan.Like Obama‚Äôs ‚Äòred line‚Äô with Syria, and Trump‚Äôs empty ultimatums to North Korea, we‚Äôre all bark and no bite, and I expect our adversaries know it. While I‚Äôm sure there are people in our government and in the military-industrial complex who‚Äôd support it, it‚Äôs my impression that most Americans would not.It may make Biden look good and feel good to talk tough to the Russians and Chinese, but I doubt it will ever go beyond that.With the Dems focused on dividing Americans domestically, over ‚Äòdiversity‚Äô and ‚Äòinclusion‚Äô: with ‚Äòsystemic racism‚Äô and ‚ÄòWhite privilege‚Äô the boogeymen, and ‚ÄòWhite supremacists‚Äô replacing ‚Äòthe red menace‚Äô as the real threat to our way of life; why would they choose to muddy the waters by taking on another controversy?But if we did declare war on Russia: what are the chances that China and/or Iran would come in on the side of Russia? Which‚Äî as I understand it‚Äî would be a war we‚Äôd have zero chance of winning.

            Nukes are no longer the sole ‚Äúlast argument of kings.‚Äù
A savvy country like Russia or China could cripple the US with cyberwar attacks in a couple of days.  Banking, power centers, GPS signals, telecommunications, internet, etc.
That is, if they just don‚Äôt blackmail our politicians first.  Maybe not possible?  The Hunter Biden thing was unreal in how 1.) bad it was 2.) covered up by the media.

                Yeah, and let‚Äôs not forget Jeffrey Epstein‚Äî who it seems almost certain was operating a classic ‚Äòhoney-trap‚Äô, collecting incriminating videos of powerful people‚Äî isn‚Äôt it odd how nothing came of that?Cyber war; an EMP attack that we may have no way of knowing where it came from, or who to retaliate against; a conventional war in which no nation goes nuclear; or an all-out nuclear war‚Äî I‚Äôm not an expert, but it‚Äôs my understanding that we likely wouldn‚Äôt come out well in any of those scenarios; certainly if China and/or Iran joined with Russia in opposing us.And if it does go nuclear: the Russians now have supersonic multi-warhead missiles that we apparently have no defense against. And didn‚Äôt the Obama administration adopt a ‚Äòno launch on warning policy‚Äô, in which we wait until we‚Äôre actually hit by an adversary‚Äôs nukes before giving the order to our military to strike back?It may be that the US military has weapons‚Äî like satellite-based ones‚Äî they aren‚Äôt talking about; but I‚Äôm under the impression that we‚Äôre no longer the top dog when it comes to any sort of serious conflict.

                Like JFK‚Äôs assignations and illnesses, or Martin Luther Kings habit of beating women into a pulp and having sex with underage White girls, the public would never hear of it.No big shot would be inconvenienced by internet outages.‚ÄúWhite Christian Trash‚Äù shivering in the dark is a feature, not a bug, of modern Western Elites.

It can‚Äôt be spun, suppressed, Twitter stormed, or arrested. It means elites are DEAD in their mansions. Dirt people dying would be a plus. but themselves, never.*The FBI tried to ruin King by having media run its tapes of him beating the hell out of women and banging 13 year old White girls. Not a single outlet would run it. It would be the same today.

They think because they went to right schools, know the right people and got the right job they are entitled to decide what people know.Not gonna happen.Honestly the more I think about it the more I think Pol Pot and Mao had some good points.

        America has come to believe two basic, now foundational lies over its history.  The first lie, is that a country can be ‚Äúan idea,‚Äù without being ‚Äúa people.‚Äù  This is the post civil war era lie.  A piece of rusty twine that held the post civil war era together with a civic religion.  The second lie is the literal reinterpretation of ‚Äúall men are created equal‚Äù to mean, ‚Äúall humans should be equal.‚Äù   The further we aggressively pursue the second lie, the more the likelihood of toppling both lies.  These lies are foundational to ‚Äúwho we are‚Äù as Derbyshire would say.  These lies exist in Europe as well, but when they topple over there the Europeans will rediscover the sub-basement containing their old cultures.  We have no sub-basement.  We have no ancient culture to fall back on.  We will be alone, and angry, and looking for anything to cling to and find nothing but aliens among us.  I strongly believe that our provocative, projecting foreign policy is an attempt to ignore our foundational lies.  A long, psychological vacation for our ownership class.

            When the likes of Hannity say we‚Äôre a nation of exceptionalism they never bring up the likes of a George Floyd or common gangbanger scum that is blight on all urban areas.  Not a lot of exceptionalism there.  In fact it‚Äôs the opposite in that it destroys the work of exceptional people.
But they will bring up Thomas Edison and the Wright Bros. as if that means anything anymore

            The worst part? Jews are officially running the Ukraine now. Check out their leader, Volodymyr Zelensky. He is Jewish and was a stand-up comedian prior to the Zionists and their American puppets inserting him as president. Word is he helped set up Trump on the phone call that led to impeachment. He will flee to Zion as soon as the first shot is fired.
Again, Russia would be well-advised to move quickly against Israel if war breaks out.

                I believe Russia will occupy Ukraine at some point in the future so I don‚Äôt see that happening. Russia won‚Äôt risk having new Khazaria on their freaking border.Also, people might be understating Israel‚Äôs importance.I‚Äôm not referring to j*uws only, but also the neocons.There is this idea in lalaland christian anglo America that j*uws will convert to christianity and that the temple must be rebuilt in Jerusalem so that Christ might return.J*uwish elites have put much effort into creating Israel, the tribe didn‚Äôt even wanna move there initially, WW2 had to happen to make it happen, can‚Äôt see them giving up on it just cause muslims are better at reproducing.

It would be nuts though, it would sure explain the hyper focus on getting russia out of ukraine. It‚Äôs basically a giant, empty country, with moderate weather, fertile soil, and certainly more ‚Äúhospitable‚Äù neighbors than the current homeland. As well as a rapidly declining population.

                Ukraine used to be known as the ‚ÄúPale of Settlement‚Äù where the Tsar kept the Jewish troublemakers. It was also part of the historic territory of the Khazar kingdom.  The radical Zionist leader Vladimir (Ze‚Äôev) Jabotinsky was born and raised in Odessa. He was the founder of the Irgun terrorist group, and godfather of the Likud movement. Netanyahu‚Äôs father was Jabotinsky‚Äôs personal secretary.

        The war will probably not happen.If it did, half the country would not be rooting for the Russians, but they would be hating DC.The actual goal of any policy for Sane Americans should be to end NATO, for if you end NATO you end the Empire- for it was for the Empire and by the Empire that Trump was overthrown- and before him Nixon.The American Empire provides the Left and the Dems and the Uniparty with the Intelligence operatives who overthrew Nixon and Trump, as well as the entrenched interests.  And money.   Lots of money.  It also buys the Generals and Admirals who commit and abet by negligence Treason.  Going back further to FDR and Wilson the Left/Dems embraced war and then Imperial Cold War to gain the powers of the State.   The best next move to be made is to collapse NATO, this requires a full court press and not DRs magical invisible hand of collapse.  Nor is it fruitful to pursue ‚Äúending wars‚Äù or ‚Äúcutting the military budget ‚Äú without ending the alliances that justify both.NATO is where it all centers on, if NATO is ended or reduced to a mere paper treaty instead of Imperial HQ in Brussels then all the rest is possible.It is the treaty that justifies all, that justifies the Empire, the rule by Intel, the occasional wars, the budget, the bases, the Empire and now this year the downfall of the Republic.Also Hegemonic Finance, and yes the Smol Hat Hofjude Imperialists.End NATO in peace and war, and much  is possible, keep NATO and little is possible.

        I know Europe has the same problems that we have on so many levels.  A lot of them are big problems.  But Europe still has various in-tact cultural identities that they can fall back on during a disaster.  We, on the other hand, have this vast continental nation of people increasingly alien to each other.  This is why it‚Äôs always been about the ‚ÄúAmerican dream‚Äù which is consumerist at its heart.  But when that breaks down, eventually, a country needs more.  At best we will peacefully go our separate ways.  Couples, some who never should have married, can stay together, long after the love is gone, because they want the same things.  Usually material things.  When that‚Äôs obliterated the couples usually divorce.  There could be a day, in the not so distant future, where our country is so broken and shattered that European countries will be accepting some American migrants, perhaps using ancestral tests.

                They have much further to fall than we do, even today.  It will be bloody but they can still clean up the mess on most of that continent.  Italians have been half African anyway.  Our demographic impairment is far beyond salvage in many places.

                    JR Wirth:  I must take issue with your characteristic of Italians as half African.  While they have, unfortunately let far too many sub-Saharans sully their native land, my half-Italian husband is as pale hu-White as they come, with blue eyes (and blond hair as a young child).  And his maternal ancestors are from southern Italy (albeit not Sicily, which is admittedly somewhat different genetically, but due to constant invasions rather than consensual miscegenation).

                        Americans say that about Italians because they don‚Äôt realize that Italy and Sicily were ‚Äúmelting pots‚Äù before America existedMost of the dark varieties are ‚ÄúItalians‚Äù but not ‚Äúof Italy‚Äù and came there for work.  Their names were Latinized over time.Best example I can give is say that a million negroes from North Carolina moved to Poland.  The Poles start to think all North Carloninians are black, they must be, look at these people here.   Then you have a white guy from North Carolina go to Poland on vacation and the locals assume he must be part black somewhere in his lineage.There is also something of a caste system.  The darkies in Italy are of mixed heritage, similar to Mestizos here, and are the ones who mostly came over through Ellis Island.  America got Italy‚Äôs Mestizos.  The real Italians stayed behind.  Which is why when you meet an upper class or so forth Italian they look little like the typical ‚ÄúItalian‚Äù you see here.  Again, it‚Äôs like comparing a Mestizo to a Spaniard upper class person from Mexico.

                Falcone:  Yet Italy is filled with Africans and Chinese.  We were watching a video of a celebration in my husband‚Äôs great-grandparents‚Äô native village (sometime in the last 10 years) and there were a couple of Africans even there in that small mountain commune.  And I know, from a frequent visitor there, that if we were to go and proclaim (however truthfully) that he is a distant cousin of all the natives, they‚Äôd shrug.That inter-relatedness is just part of life there, whereas for descendants here it frequently comes as a revelation ‚Äì cannot tell you how many tearful/joyous/excited messages I‚Äôve gotten on Ancestry from people who‚Äôve discovered their ancestry through my translation/documentation of all of that village‚Äôs records back to the Napoleonic age.Perhaps because your family roots in America don‚Äôt go back as far, or because you still have closer relatives still in Italy, it would work for you.  But I would argue that for most Americans, the connection is too old (and often too mixed) to return to one particular European nation  That‚Äôs the whole definition of a White American, something new ‚Äì and it‚Äôs definitely got its pros and cons.

                    Oh yes, for sureI still consider myself European ‚Äî or enough ‚Äî where I have a hard time letting go of the culture so that the idea of living for eternity among or alongside blacks and their culture is a complete non-starter, for example.  That‚Äôs where me and the typical white Southerner or American part ways.  Having lived here much longer, they have managed to find a way to live side by side with blacks.  I do not think I ever can and not have a heart attack.  That‚Äôs how much their garbage ghetto culture infuriates me b/c I can‚Äôt NOT see it juxtaposed to MY European culture.  I can‚Äôt get out of my head the great paintings of Europe, for example.  Or the music.  They‚Äôre stuck there.  And then I see the black crap put up next to them.  Not even in the same league.  It‚Äôs all so preposterous.I was born here and am second gen American but I can‚Äôt take it.  And then all the lying you have to do so you don‚Äôt upset them.  Even the other day i was talking to a friend about how I get the best suntans in march in the desert at the tennis tournament out here, and this black person gets up in a huff like we are trying to speak in code insult him.  Can‚Äôt even talk about getting a suntan around them.Yes, life would be much easier and simpler for me if I were a little less European and a little more easygoing about the black situation, and the ((())) situation, and the brown and Asian situation, but that‚Äôs not my fate. My European-ness has not been bred out of me yet, and no sense fighting it.  How you all manage to do it and not go crazy is beyond me.

                        I think the ability of southern whites and blacks to get along better is a residual cultural attribute to segregation in years past.  I see this as fleeting.  Atlanta is a great example.  It‚Äôs careening into an African no man‚Äôs land and taking Georgia with it.  I‚Äôm thankful to not have to fly there anymore.  I actually see future white people fleeing from the black belt the way the French fled Haiti after the slave revolt.  Sure the Chicago and Ohio ones are more aggressive and charmless, putting the capital N in the n word, but the gap is closing fast, and in the wrong direction.

                        JR ‚Äì whites living in Atlanta are on borrowed time, that‚Äôs for sure. And frankly all the Asian imports too.I could see rural whites + Hispanics in Georgia carving out some space for themselves.We‚Äôre on borrowed time here in Toronto too ‚Äì all it would take for the various non white groups to agree that they don‚Äôt want us, and we would be out. I imagine 2% or less of whites in Toronto have firearms, and 0.05% might be racially aware.The demographic situation is very dire for whites with an outgroup preference. At least the whites, in Brazil, Mexico, etc. are not totally self hating. Dixieland whites, rural Albertan whites, French-Canadians, and some rural ontario whites at least have a sense of in group preference. I don‚Äôt really see it anywhere else.Liberals will probably die, and it will be hell on earth for the more logical ones.

                Falcone,
Do you speak Italian? I also have Right of Jus Sanguinis if I want to bail to Italy but in the research I‚Äôve done on it you have to actually pass an Italian language test not unlike the TOEFL exam foreigners used to have to take to get in the US before we just opened the floodgates.
Did you take that exam or was it required or did they just hand you citizenship?

                    Yes, I speak Italian ‚Äî but when I get back to America it fades in a few weeks.When I am back in Italy it comes back in a few weeks.The words are still there in my head but they go dormant when I am away.I did not have to take an Italian language test.  My grandfather was born there and then my other three grandparents are one generation removed.  So I have the right of citizenship by ‚Äúblood‚Äù as you state.  All I did was have some birth and marriage certificates authenticated by Italian officials and some other things, then I had to go to the consulate and give an interview.  In summary, I had to prove my chain to the old country via my parents and grandparents so I had to prove they were in fact my relatives, etc.  That‚Äôs all it is; proving the chain through documentation.Now if you are not a citizen by blood, I have no idea about the language test.  I can ask my brother.   He lives there permanently now and I think he knows a few British expats in Italy.

        America, and ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù have been in periodic conflict with Russia since the US put troops on the ground there to oppose the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War. Relations between the two have been icy ever since. That‚Äôs over a century of mutual mistrust and antagonism. And, I must say, the US may be more to blame than Russia.
Now on a somewhat different topic, if AINO desires to destroy Russia in order to plunder her natural resources, why not simply pillage Africa instead? The Dark Continent would be a much less difficult nut to crack.

                I upvoted this, but both are at play.
Obviously the Ukraine (government) is a very nasty Jewish puppet state, and the Tribe‚Äôs old grudge against Russia is a key feature. But much of it is aimed at the fossil fuels and, especially, their European markets. Mind you, (((they))) are well-represented among those exploiters.
Even Normie Con will shake off the warm fuzzies about Zion if this plays out the way it is going.

                    Russia sees itself partly as the direct descendant of the Byzantine (East Roman) Empire. That is why they call Moscow ‚ÄòThe Third Rome‚Äô. This partly explains Russia‚Äôs obsession with the Balkans and Istanbul (aka Constantinoble and Byzantium) in particular. And, the Romans were pretty rough on Israel 1.0 which may partly explain the bizarre hatred for Russia among some Jews. That Hitler would have won his war without Russia doesn‚Äôt seem to count for much in the same circles. But I guess that‚Äôs a story for another time.

            Stranger:  Dullard in chief is a mere figurehead, while his mulatta sidekick is the public face of anti-White hatred and ascendancy.  Those actually in charge of US domestic, financial, and particularly foreign policy are a different people whose ultimate goals are not in your interests.  The movie was fun, albeit dated.  The eternal anti-Russian foreign policy is ridiculous and dangerous.

        The weird thing is that since the Cold War ended, China has absolutely replaced the Soviet Union as our mortal enemy.  Nobody in the mainstream talks about because the Chinese bought them off.A sane foreign policy would have the U.S. getting closer to Russia (we have much in common) and pulling them away from China.

                Aren‚Äôt you familiar with the old communist saying about the capitalists?‚ÄúThey will sell us the rope with which we will hang them.‚ÄùOur Elites have sold them our industries, along with their established support industries, and all of these industries‚Äô accumulated, hard won expertise, along with their intellectual property. And when they merely outsourced production, this resulted in not only loss of intellectual property, but the jobs of millions of US citizens, and the economic lifeblood of the communities in which they and their families lived. Economic and social havoc.Then Our Elites invited in thousand upon thousands of their students to our best scientific and technical universities (to the exclusion of our own US citizens) to glean their educations from our finest teachers along with with access to the facilities of the universities. Was what then eventuated a brotherhood of disinterested scientists? Not when many of these foreign scholars were answerable to the Peoples‚Äô Liberation Army.And on and on in many other ways, burrowing into the underpinnings of our national institutions, and in turn, the wellsprings of national power.

        We had a War on Terror, now we have a War on Health. Covid has been the galvanizing event, thankfully not as strong as 9/11.Sure, the neocons are always sneaking around, looking to start a war, but they‚Äôre the only ones who want war with Russia, and if they press the issue to the point of capturing public attention, the effort will fail.They‚Äôd have to get the thing going white hot while few are looking. Let‚Äôs hope they don‚Äôt.Imo the empire will make the easy move and continue turning inward, not just into people‚Äôs minds, but also their bodies.

        The American people are simply not cooperating with the approved script. There was supposed to be a hot civil war ongoing by now, driven by the increasing insanity out of DC. This would have been the optimum strategy for deflecting public attention away from the failures of the political class to manage the US government. But NOOOO! You had to stay calm instead of rioting in the streets, so now it becomes necessary to start a foreign war as the Plan B diversion. You just wait. A lot of innocent young men will now die needlessly and it will all be your fault!!!!! And then I‚Äôm stamp my feet and hold my breath until I pass out, and then you‚Äôll be sorry.Signed, Joe Biden‚Äôs handler.

            The real irony here is that the Wokelings and their Political Leadership doesn‚Äôt like the US Government anymore than we do.  The Right wants out.  The Left thinks its just a White Supremacist fascist state.  Millions of migrants endlessly stream across our border for cash jobs that pay what most people would consider poverty wages but they couldn‚Äôt care less about ‚ÄúAmerican Ideals‚Äù.  It‚Äôs the money.  We are all stuck dancing around to the tune of cold hard cash and our government is using that to play everyone off of everybody else.We all really need to band together with antifa, anarchists, communists, migrants, Mexican Cartels, the Russians and everyone else who wants to stick a fork in the Federalist experiment and bring it to an end.  America as an idea sounded great on paper and then we ended up with a bunch of lunatics drunk on the power of spending trillions of dollars ruling over us.  I think it‚Äôs really inevitable that happened in a ‚Äúhindsight is 20/20‚Äù kind of way.  It‚Äôs got to end.Between the US Government, which has explicitly declared all of us to be domestic terrorists for merely disagreeing with the political direction of the country, and Russia, I would say our biggest problem is the US Government.

            The non snark move Severian is to end NATO, or reduce it to a paper treaty only.  NATO is the core of the Empire- that overthrew the Republic.
Also; the military, the actual military is not what you say it is, the actual military is basically that Drill Sgt who just got arrested for touching a magic black man causing trouble in his neighborhood.

                We have not been in a major war since Korea. What‚Äôs been going on in the Sandbox for the last 20 years is low grade punishment strikes against 3rd world serfs living in mud huts. Nobody in their right mind would ever compare that to a full blown war.Our army is tiny and the Marine corps had been reduced to light infantry who couldn‚Äôt handle a single mechanized infantry division on it‚Äôs own,  Worse we are so casualty adverse, if we start taking thousands of KIA and WIA in the first month. You;‚Äôll watch morale plummet. Not to mention young men avoiding the military like the plague.Lets not forget Russia can rain down their Kaliber missiles on Europe at will. Take out a few major electrical centers and refineries and you send Europe back 100 years.But I doubt any of this enters in the mind of our military men who believes they are invincible even though they haven‚Äôt won a war since WWII.

        Count me among those rooting for Russia.  I never felt as surveilled in Russia as I do in the US (I can‚Äôt say the same for Bulgaria, when I usually had 2-6 cars following me everywhere I went, but that was just the job; it wasn‚Äôt personal).  While re-evaluating everything I ever learned about history over the past 15-20 years, I‚Äôve significantly altered my opinion of certain presidents.  Theodore Roosevelt has dropped precipitously.  Whatever one thinks of the original rationale, there‚Äôs no denying he began the empire.  And his cousin Franklin dialed it up to 10.I‚Äôm tired of the world being defined by the fact that, although millions upon millions of people all over the world died in the 1940s, one particular group decided their lives mattered more than all others.  Refugee policies are rooted in the aftermath of that conflict.  Multiculturalism, citizenism, miscegenation ‚Äì although the original roots of some were planted decades earlier by the same damned people, all saw full flowering after the war.  That was also the true beginning of America as the world‚Äôs policeman (again, though, Teddy Roosevelt tried it first, damn his soul).When I first really delved into 18th and 19th century European history in grad school, I found the constant interplay of nations and balancing of powers unnecessary and. destructive.  My instinctive ‚Äòleave me alone small ‚Äòl‚Äô libertarian instincts coming out.  Even acknowledging that life is a constant struggle for land and power and resources, it just seemed such an utter waste, and the jockeying for international position never, ever stops.  Come the mid-20th century, what interest did the shopkeeper in England have with the average villager in Poland, that he would want to send his sons to die for him?  And here we are, in 2021, where the average ‚Äòmurrican in rural Tennessee is supposed to be overwrought about Ukraine and Crimea .It‚Äôs fashionable (and unquestionably true) to claim Negro fatigue, but I also have international ennui.  I don‚Äôt care what happens in Burundi.   I‚Äôm not brokenhearted by Mestizo gangbanger deaths, and I don‚Äôt feel all warm and virtuous when I see a Ghanaian child dropped over the US/Mexican border fence to its father.   I don‚Äôt care that one group in nation x harbors resentment against nation y.  The big difference between me and many others on the dissident right, though, is that I no longer just want to be left alone.  Because I recognize that will never, ever happen, I just want to kill them all. About 95% of the human race.  Start over with about half of the White race worldwide which doesn‚Äôt hate itself, and the world will do just fine.  As for the rest of so-called ‚Äòhumanity,‚Äô frankly, I just don‚Äôt give a damn.

            Theodore Roosevelt was pretty low in my Presidential ratings but has climbed recently as I now appreciate his willingness to smash overly large corporations into pieces.  Franklin is irredeemably bad.

                I‚Äôve struggled for a few years to decide on an opinion regarding T. Roosevelt.  If he could dial down the foreign meddling, he‚Äôd probably be a decent President for today‚Äôs times, but only if it was the Teddy of 1901-1908 and not the Bull Moose Roosevelt that ran in 1912.  By that point, he‚Äôd jumped the social justice shark.

            I was raised to regard Teddy Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln as two of our best Presidents. Now I think they‚Äôre two of the worst (though there‚Äôs a lot of competition). My education also included not a single bad word about Woodrow Wilson. I had to learn about his monstrous activities all on my own. Meanwhile there were Presidents I remember my (((social studies teacher in middle school))) thoroughly denouncing, such was Warren Harding, for whom I have newfound respect.

                The one redeeming feature of Lincoln was his insatiable desire for victory.  Damn him to hell for his cause, but if we had leaders similarly focused on preserving white, Christian, masculine culture, and not prevaricating grifters like DJT, we‚Äôd be in better hands than we are today.

                    You‚Äôre right on about Lincoln‚Äôs killer instinct.  You can hate his cause, but you must admire his ruthlessness for total victory.  We‚Äôve got to re-learn that.
As a depressed young man I read about Lincoln because of his alleged depression, the tragic death of his boy, and his insane wife.  But in spite of all that, the man had the killer instinct.
I wish the South had won but you can still learn from your enemy‚Äôs strengths.

            Bill Mullins:  I downvoted you because, while NATO definitely needs to end, I don‚Äôt agree with the resentment against Europe.  Yes, each nation does need to finance its own needs, but their governments are just as corrupt and distinct from their actual people as ours.Absolutely we need to bring home all US troops ‚Äì not merely from Europe and Japan, but every tiny atoll and every African village.  The world is not our oyster.  And I am personally TIRED hearing about so-called tough and easily-assimilated Koreans.  I worked for a Korean company before most Americans had heard of any of them,  and while I got along fine with my boss (in an office that had just the two of us for months),  I fully recognized the cultural differences between us.  No, they‚Äôre not my enemy, but they‚Äôre not my people.

        One obvious conclusion that can be drawn from this now two decade long effort to start a war with Russia is the President no longer controls foreign policy.This is reminiscent of Japan post WWI.   The democratic government was very weak and the cabinet level bureaucracies acted as independent fiefdoms committing Japan to war on multiple fronts in an ad hoc and heater smelter way.  From the outside, it appeared to be an aggressive unified imperial power.  The reality was almost the opposite.Which, if that holds true here, we will see the US blundering into wars that it is unprepared for and simultaneously engaging in destructive internal ‚Äúreforms‚Äù.

            This is the tough thing for most to grasp. The ‚Äúpeople in charge‚Äù are distributed over a network of power centers. Decisions are made through unofficial channels and then formalized though official channels, but not always through political channels. Mastercard maintaining a black list of groups and individuals banned from the financial system is a good example. These decisions are made in private, but implemented through policy at a single node.We got a glimpse of this in foreign policy when Trump zapped the Iranian general. Well out of official circles, the decision to do something was made by the people really in charge of foreign policy. They had their preferred course, which was killing the general. They knew Trump would go for the big move, so they inserted that into the list of options Trump‚Äôs adviser presented to him. Trump‚Äôs advisers never saw it coming.

                    Suleimani  deserved every bit of the hellfire targeted on his ass. Clean up what‚Äôs left of a 19 yo killed by an EFP made and supplied by Iran a few times you might think so too.Do I still think we should have been there. No I don‚Äôt  but that doesn‚Äôt change the burning hate I will always carry for those that killed our sons and especially the ones wh o sent them to be killed.The same ones now that are trying their danmdest to provoke an incident with Russia.

A bureaucratic culture, at that.  Is this an emergent, self-arising feature of bureaucracy?
Seems to be, per any period in history.  Does Empire arise from bureaucracy, then, not necessarily from conspiracy?

                ‚ÄúDecisions are made through unofficial channels and then formalized though official channels, but not always through political channels.

Exactly right. Disrupting these channels should be a priority if any of our guys ever get power again (I know, big if).

        One of the biggest redpills of the J tribe is their hatred of russia and russians. And putin. I‚Äôve always assigned alot of blame for our current state on gentiles ‚Äì I know so many insane self hating gentiles.But when it comes to russia, this is almost a purely J hysteria. Literally nobody wakes up outraged at russia except the certain few. The promotion of russian hatred is ENTIRELY coming from J‚Äôs. Russia is actually highly respected around the world ‚Äì probably more than the usa in many places.So, while I‚Äôm agnostic on the theory that the Js are behind all our ills (and it‚Äôs our job to fix It no matter what), pay attention to the motivations behind saber rattling here. They would nuke all of russia in a heartbeat if they could get away with it. And, do not support the usa in a conflict.

‚ÄúBorn in Italy, educated in America and living in Russia for the past 30 years with his wife and 14 children, Lazar has developed a close relationship with Putin, who he says was the first Russian leader to treat Jews as equals and to fight antisemitism.

        A weird aspect of the American Empire is its compulsion to retain the boundaries that existed before its rise.   Most of those boundaries were created as a last hurrah of Anglo-French imperialism in the 1920s ‚Äì but are now considered absolutely sacrosanct by Washington.Crimea and the Ukraine are another example as Crimea had been part of Russia since before the US Declaration of Independence and only moved to Ukranian jurisdiction in the 1950s by decree of the Communist dictator Kruschev.  But now it must eternally be Ukrainian.   Which itself  had fluid boundaries for centuries ‚Äì but now the divisions of the post WWII communist era must be eternal.

Meanwhile like 1/6 of it‚Äôs landmass, the entire Southwest is majority hispanic and could secede back to Mexico at any time. Not to mention chinese colonies growing as well as black ethnostate groups in georgia and mississippi.

            Very true. We did away with conscription some years ago and only the lowest social outcast volunteer for military service. There has been a push in advertising for military service, but everyone knows it‚Äôs a joke.
Unlike the very professional USmilitary, the German military is more like the Boy Scouts with heavy equipment. But at least the Boy Scouts are well trained.

                I have mixed feelings on US troops in Germany. First, I have had the privilege of knowing many of them for decades, and they are by far the most friendly and professional military on the planet. For me, they are always welcome.I don‚Äôt think the average German even thinks twice about it given how few Americans are still here since the reduction back in the late 90‚Äôs. But most have very good feelings towards a US presence. And not for protection, but because they military makes a point of integrating their personnel and families into the German community.On the other hand, with the social and public problems you are having in your own country, I question the expenditures of over seas bases and what it costs to keep it all going. And it‚Äôs not just the military over here that‚Äôs expensive, it‚Äôs dozens of contractors like Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon and others who are making billions in defense contracts.I‚Äôll be the first to admit I do miss the sounds and sights of F-4‚Äôs, F-15‚Äôs and F-16‚Äôs and the occasional A-10. It‚Äôs been pretty quiet in the Hunsr√ºck since they left. There‚Äôs nothing quite like being woken up in the wee hours when a group of Abrahams tanks and armored personnel carriers go clanking through your village during a Reforger.Good times! üôÇ

                        The immediate advantage of the US leaving is the availability of housing and commercial buildings.When the Air Force closed the hospital in Wiesbaden back in the mid 90‚Äôs, that entire building facility was converted into the Hessen State police headquarters. Lindsey Air Station, just up the street, converted nearly all of the buildings into apartments. This has been duplicated at almost every US military installation that has closed.Rhein Main air base, which used to be the other half of the Frankfurt airport, was turned over and now Frankfurt has two parallel runways. All of the older military facilities are used for commercial purposes. Hahn air bse was also repurposed for commercial use.For locations that are a bit more remote, like Grafenw√∂hr, there would be an economic impact on the local economy. But it would rebound in time.So any loss of US presence would have a benefit to the local communities. The pros and cons are often discussed every time a new US administration comes into office.

        Russia should not make a major announcement  but should immediately expel all Jewish and/or Israeli-affiliated organizations. If things get hot, menace a small Israeli city by proxy, possibly using Hezbollah as surrogatesThe monsters who control the Empire will back down only if they realize the Zionist entity could be erased from the face of the planet. It is not due to a love of Jewish people, for the most part, but Israel is a major cash cow and one of their last big profit centers.As you point out, this also presents the Europeans with an opportunity to decouple from a dying Empire. While it‚Äôs largely unspoken except privately, most Europeans resent America‚Äôs occupation via military bases. This is true also in Korea and to a lesser extent Japan. So this could be a two-fer for Europe, at least. A month ago it seemed probable Germany would succumb to pressure over  Nordstream but that has dissipated, in no small part due to the Empire‚Äôs heavy-handedness. Like most bullies, failure has produced an even angrier tantrum.Finally, the individual states would be well-advised to condemn the Empire‚Äôs Ukranian provocations and to highlight what a horriric garbage pit the Kiev puppet state is.   Good relations with Europe and Russia will be needed if individual states can exploit the ensuing chaos to separate from the Empire.

            [M]ost Europeans resent America‚Äôs occupation via military bases. This is also tru in Korea and to a.lesser extent Japan.
Agree completely except that my experience in Japan 79 ‚Äì 82 would indicate they resented the living hell outta us ‚Äúgaijins‚Äù polluting their country with our presence. We need to pull our troops outta pretty much everywhere outside our own borders. Let the Europeans, Japanese, Koreans and Filipinos defend themselves!

                The rape tendency of Sacred Africans poisoned the well in Okinawa. I was there in a civilian capacity during Japan‚Äôs brief economic triumphalism in the 80‚Äôs. There was a lust for revenge and given their small footprint it was shocking how often Blacks were cited as a cause for much of the disgust. You can bet the farm a vibrant Defense Secretary has been met with thus-far unvoiced outrage.

                        American bases are required to hire ‚Äúlocal nationals‚Äô (Germans) to do much of the contracting work the military doesn‚Äôt do. Such as infrastructure maintenance (roads, power, water, etc) new building contracts, etc. They also hire local Germans to work in the base facilities like the base exchange, post office, theater, dining halls, bowling alley, libraries, etc. So there are economic opportunities and benefits to the local German communities as well.

            It‚Äôs not only the American empire the current Euro-States might want to withdraw from. Recall not that long ago when you were Euro-Nations? Not quite so much these past few decades. The EU is a mixed blessing, and after much groaning and straining, I understand that the UK has withdrawn.As an American, of course I have nostalgia for our glorious days of empire. I ‚Äúoccupied‚Äù Germany in the early 80s üòÄ But our empire is fading, and as such, we should withdraw our troops. This is not entirely a disappointment: There is a lot to be said to be able to visit a foreign country as a genuine guest, and not merely because you are part of a de-facto colonial government.

If it takes another WW3 or WW4 to completely eradicate all genetic memory of Europeans (read: Whites), so what?They are quite convinced that they will be safe as houses because so long as they control the propaganda arms we can have another SHOAH! in which any remaining survivors will be horrified by what was done in the Super Cereal Really Final We Truly Mean It This Time Solution v2.0. It will be even worse than before with at least 6 quadrillion killed and the useless eaters, Joe Six Packs, griller goy, catladies, soyboys, manlets, trannies, and whoever else is left will buy it hook, line, and sinker. It has kept the entire Western World asleep and paralyzed for 70 years, why not another 70?tl;dr- Stop thinking so hard, you are letting your inner Conservative shine through. They. Don‚Äôt. Care. They are tribal enough to survive it has worked for 2K years, you‚Ä¶ are not. They know this. So another big Brother War should solve the ‚ÄúCaucasian Question‚Äù once and for all. Far faster than the slow boil of the ever increasing anti-White rhetoric. The useful idiot darkies are not going to be efficient enough for their timeline. Throwing apex predators (Whites) against one another will get the job done lickety split. More clear now? Or do we need more hand-wringing and agonizing? Here to help‚Ä¶

        Germany‚Äôs response is very interesting. They need that natural gas, but they‚Äôre unwillingness to side with the Americans likely is about more than that. If the Europeans begin to view the United States as no better or worse than Russia, we‚Äôve entered a very different world.For the past 30 years, the United States has been pushing countries around needlessly. And there‚Äôs no end in sight. What has Russia done in that time? Nothing. The only fights that it‚Äôs been involved in were provoked by others. At some point, other countries start to notice.Germany and the other Europeans are under no illusions that Russia is their buddy. It is not. But is it really any worse than the United States. Seems to me that the Europeans might shift to being much more neutral, letting the U.S. and Russia balance each other out. Neither Russia nor the United States can afford to alienate the Europeans so neutrality is a smart bet.

            The thing the Germans know is the Russians are predictable. They know what motivates Putin. America has become so erratic and reckless, no one can know who is in charge, much less what motivates them.

                Yes, that‚Äôs a very important point. Putin is an old-school leader of Russia. He wants to secure its borders, have a few buffer states and maintain his internal control. Pretty straight-forward. You can ballpark his reaction to policies.The United States has become a fun house. What‚Äôs more, it‚Äôs a black box. Who‚Äôs in charge? It sure isn‚Äôt Biden. Who‚Äôs making the decisions? What‚Äôs their motivation? Is it factions with one side winning some of the time and another side winning some of the time? Is so, now you don‚Äôt know the motivations of several competing factions.We use Deep State as though it‚Äôs one operation, but that‚Äôs almost certainly not the case. State Dept, CIA, the military, FBI, etc., they all have power in the Deep State.It really is reminiscent of the Soviet Union near the end when they were installing old men as general secretary as a cabal ran the show.

Nearly every key player on the Biden team is a member of the globalist Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), including the secretaries of State, Treasury, Defense, Commerce, Homeland Security and CIA. The CFR network has run the show since WW2.

                What we know is Russians are corrupt, but they are not stupid.  Fortunately they‚Äôre still impressed with Bosch refrigerators and S-Class Mercedes and are quite willing to provide us with all the natural gas we can buy. Despite all the think tanks in America trying to convince us Russia is a threat, we all know they have no interest in a European invasion and less in the idea of occupation of Germany or any part of Europe.

                    The idea that the Red Army is poised to plunge through the Fulda Gap in a 1940-style blitzkrieg to the English Channel is as outdated as a TRS-80.

                    Isn‚Äôt Germany somewhat, well, confused about energy policy? What we get here (USA) about you guys is that you have the Green faction which gained enough power to shut down Germany‚Äôs nuclear power program and start a rather ridiculous solar power effort. In the end this is why you guys buy electricity from Russian RBMK (Chernobyl) style reactors and Russian gas for everything else. What is the German mainstream thinking on energy? Does the German elite really believe in Biden‚Äôs Green New Deal actually producing any working technology or do they want to stick with things they know can work? ‚Äì i.e. Russian nukes and gasI‚Äôm asking because we Murrikans honestly don‚Äôt know who is running our country at this point or exactly how crazy they really are.

                        Germany has been transitioning from fossil fuels to renewables for decdes and has done so before it was ‚Äúa thing‚Äù. Stuttgart for example, has been burning it‚Äôs garbage to generate power and is one of the most efficient and clean burning plants in Germany.Here‚Äôs a breakdown of our energy sources ‚ÄìGas 15%Solar 7.8%Hydro 3.3%Wind 20.8%Biomass 7.4% (from farms)Black and brown coal 27.2%Nuclear 12.4%As noted above, only 15% of our energy comes from gas, and of that, the Russians provide half only half of it. The other half comes from Norway and the Netherlands. So if something bad happens in Russia, it will hardly affect us at all in terms of energy reliance.At the end of the day, it‚Äôs cheaper for Germany to buy it form our neighbors than making it ourselves.

            ‚ÄúGermany and the other Europeans are under no illusions that Russia is their buddy. It is not. But is it really any worse than the United States.‚ÄùIndeed.

The cancer which manifests itself in American television shows, American celebrity, American corporations ‚Äì more generally American culture. In fact, for that reason alone, Ivan, from this Englishman‚Äôs perspective is not as bad as the US. The US has almost compleat cultural dominance within The Isles; it poses an Internal threat if you will.‚ÄúWhat has Russia done in that time? Nothing.‚ÄùYes. Compared to Others, she has not been busy at all. Still gets a whipping from every Tom, Dick &amp; Harry though.My apologies to Americans of the correct colour and heritage, but perhaps much of Europe still firmly believes that the US is our friend. Almost all of our propaganda enforces this belief ‚Äì except when Trump happened, because Trump was Hitler and therefore his government was bad. For all it‚Äôs bluster, and I am not sure howmuchof a physical threat The Bear is to The Isles, Russia is still external and a known historical problem. That said, plenty of Russian oligarchs, I say Russian but mean Jewish, appear to be buying up property in London.

                The Russian oligarchs. A term that‚Äôs an example of the denotation/connotation dichotomy. Oligarch has a negative connotation, maybe because it‚Äôs a seldom used term. In the case of Russia, the demise of their ‚Äúcommunist‚Äù state meant that publicly-owned property had to be distributed to private entities, people and institutions run by them. Was the once state-owned property supposed to be given to other collectives? No, inevitably the ownership of steel mills and immense farms had to be transferred to private hands, not phony collectives. It‚Äôs one of the problems of deconstructing socialism.In the case of the US itself, when real property was confiscated from the native Americans, the state assumed ownership and the methods of distribution. That smacks of socialism as a prelude to bandit capitalism. In fact, the US embraces socialism whole-heartedly through the public school system, an institution that couldn‚Äôt be more socialist.

                OrangeFrog:  Very important distinction.  Whenever one reads about Russians outside of Russia, they‚Äôre most often Jevvs who happen to have Russian nationality.

                I can‚Äôt speak for all Europeans, but the average German, Frenchman, Italian or Spaniard has no issues with Americans in general. Like all countries, we all smile when the tourists show up who haven‚Äôt a clue about what they‚Äôre looking at. But we forgiven them. We know most don‚Äôt know their own short history, let alone 2,000 years of ours. üòâ
The problem we have is the same one you have; it‚Äôs not the people we have issue with, it‚Äôs the people running the country we‚Äôre worried about. Because the decisions they make don‚Äôt affect themselves, but everyone else.

        Here‚Äôs one that would absolutely be rooting for the Ruskies.  The idea that there is a parasitic element buried in the leviathan‚Äôs flesh agitating for war with a nuclear power is insane.  How are the usual suspects going to rule over what‚Äôs left of the American empire with its awesome (and increasing) diversity when it‚Äôs a smoking ruin?Joggers are an intractable enough problem, but the usual suspects who can never be mentioned, really must be removed from all seats of power and influence.

            I‚Äôll say about the Russians what I said about the Chinese:
Are the Russians filling my area with Central Americans and Indians?
Are the Russians discriminating against me and my children?
Are the Russians pushing joggers to riot throughout the country?
Are the Russians manipulating the financial system?
Are the Russians controlling the media and using it to spew hatred against Whites?
Etc., etc., etc.
I know who the real enemy is, and it ain‚Äôt the Russians.

                No, and russia is the only nation in the world who has said anything about the mis treatment of Anglosphere whites. First the talk of South African farmers going to russia. Now Lavrov mentioning the anti white agenda.Putin wants the best for his fellow Europeans in distress. We are both european, christian derived peoples. However, he has his nation to run and people to manage, and white americans are not russians.Also, at this point it could be argued that importing NW-Euro prots is dangerous. Import the cuck world, become the cuck world? While it would be nice for Russia to save us, I think it‚Äôs up to us to stay and duke it out here.

                    ‚ÄúImport the cuck world, become the cuck world? ‚ÄùYep. This would be my first thought. Keep ‚Äôem away.‚ÄúWhile it would be nice for Russia to save us, I think it‚Äôs up to us to stay and duke it out here.‚ÄùIndeed. As terrifying and as despair inducing as it can be. At some point, You, Your Sons, Your Grand Sons will have to fight someone ‚Äì most probably a representative ofThe Organs, so may as well do it in our own lands. Mind you, most of the books ofThe Bibleseem to indicate far harsher and more brutal modes of existence; so there is that for encouragement (for the religiously inclined). Life is judgement and suffering too.I was explaining to my father at the weekend why I had yet to buy a house in my overpriced and rapidly declining area of London. After giving some reasons, I said to him that home ownership ‚Äì whilst desirable for a mature and healthy society ‚Äì was probably never the norm. It can be taken/taxed away at will, especially by people who have little understanding of the balance of these things. It only takes one SJW leader, backed by SJW MPs to reason that all that I have worked for was unfairly gained. Then whack up that property tax‚Ä¶ and again, and again. We were both quiet for a moment, perhaps realizing that if humans had survived in the past we‚Äôll survive in a future that resembles the past. Anyway, a sobering thought.On the plus side, I am hearing more and more on the grapevine in the UK about parents ‚Äì usually Christians ‚Äì deciding to home school their children.

            It feels good to write that, but my kids are draft age, and the people pushing the buttons will not be touched by their catastrophic decisions.That being said, the Official Government Party in the US consists of inept, weak, easily frightened cucks (see also: barbed wire fences around the Capitol because people yelled at them loudly).  A good wrap across the beak by the Bear would probably cause the institutions to collapse.We have a few military bases in my city.  This morning ‚Äì for an INCH OF SNOW ‚Äì the scrawl on the local news had 3-sentences of instructions ordering military personnel not to ‚Äúdepart your residence until 9:30am‚Äù.  All the schools were like ‚ÄúD22, 2-hour delay‚Äù and so forth.  Think about how feckless and stupid your Generals and Colonels have to be to put a 3-sentence order on the a.m. news crawl for one goddamned inch of snow‚Ä¶.Our young men will be sent off to war overseen by leaders who care more about women‚Äôs issues, trannies, gays, and P.C. horsecrap than winning a decisive war against a country that is not our enemy.

                        Yea not to get all white pilled or anything but the fact that there are still 200M people (of the same stock that built the modern world and put a man on the moon) running around loose, could pose a serious problem for the ZOG at some point..

                        I think this will be the endgame for the Zoggies here actually. They saw the shining bauble of Covid out there and thought it was the Philosopher‚Äôs Stone. ‚Äì With this, we can get rid of Orangeman, permanently corrupt elections, wreck the small businesses that still prevent total corporate takeover of the economy, desensitize the population to totalitarian micromanagement of behavior‚Ä¶They forgot that they still need another 20 years or so to lock in the demographics for the Big Putsch though. I wonder if the historians will say that Covid was more like the One Ring to them, an irresistible temptation that eventually seduced and destroyed it‚Äôs possessor.

                I‚Äôm still squishy on the JQ so as one of the guys who can‚Äôt keep the high pace about ‚Äòthe truth‚Äô (if you‚Äôre right??) I honestly appreciate the restraint. And maybe you are right about the JQ but if you are I‚Äôd bet my last dollar it‚Äôs emergent behavior (ie instinct by a highly ethnocentric, smart and traumatized minority) far more than a deliberate plan or conspiracy. Anyone who‚Äôs ever run or administered anything involving more than 3 people knows how hard it is to keep things both quiet and on track. On a civilizational level I can‚Äôt see that happening.Btw, Tucker Carlson‚Äôs showdown w the ADL is pretty interesting, even for someone who generally prefers not to see it from the JQ angel. Like I said, maybe you are on to something??

                    Yes, there is likely more emergent behavior than explicit planning.  Emergent behavior shaped by thousands of years of evolution.  It‚Äôs fascinating that they don‚Äôt need to consciously coordinate.
To return to the subject of Z‚Äôs post, hatred of Russia is probably more emergent behavior than conscious planning.
