        Yes, the monied elites will snap up the prime real estate, and the Cuban rulers will be their Mafia partners. The Cuban rulers must be perfectly aware of the KGB model to economic success in Russia.The racial composition is similar to Puerto Rico. Cuba is 65% white, and although they are a dumbed down and emasculated white, they may have an advantage or two in evolving into something much better, while Puerto Rico is thoroughly trapped in the welfare mindset of the USA and going no where. The Utopians are indeed rubbing their hands over Cuba, but developments will likely get completely away from them.Froude visited Cuba in 1882 and gave this report–The political future is dark; the government is unimaginably corrupt–so corrupt that change is inevitable, though what change it would be idle to prophesy. The Americans looked at the island which lay so temptingly near them, but they were wise in their generation. They reflected that to introduce into an Anglo-Saxon republic so insoluble an element as a million Spanish Roman Catholics alien in blood and creed, with half a million blacks to swell the dusky flood which runs too full among them already, would be to invite an indigestion of serious consequence. A few years since the Cubans born were on the eve of achieving their independence like their brothers in Mexico and South America. Perhaps they will yet succeed. Spanish, at any rate, they are to the bone and marrow, and Spanish they will continue.

        Gosh, maybe there’ll be a whole new “health tourism” industry, if one is to buy Mr. Moore’s “insight”.I’d hate to think that any new investment “unexpectedly” be deemed worthy of Communist “nationalization”, yet AGAIN!Dominican Cigars, (Hispanolian, if you will-and THAT island OWES us actual taxPAYERS, and “charitable” donors, big time) in a natural Virginia wrapper, are just fine thank you very much!You want an Embassy there? There’s already a prime piece of US real estate there that has been developed at an ASTONISHING expense!

        The irony is that Singapore is about to become the next Cuba.

        Looks to me like you misunderstood Tyler Cowan’s post  – exactly 180° off.
Looks to me like he is saying pretty much the same thing you are – but without your insights regarding liberals andlibertarians.

            I don’t know, RedFred. He makes this point:5. I don’t in general buy “brain drain” arguments, but they do sometimes apply to islands and for historical reasons they are especially likely to apply to Cuba.  Many of the most talented Cubans were encouraged to leave, or managed to leave, and staying in Miami will be better than going back for a long time to come.Maybe I’m reading that in the context of the general Tyler Cowen oeuvre, but it seems to me that he is signalling that he really does not think the lack of bright ambitious Cubans in Cuba is an issue. I could be wrong. Read literally, he may be saying Cuba is an exception to his religious beliefs about talent drains.It does raise another point about open borders fanatics like Cowen. They look away from the realities of immigration, like we saw with Cuba. They have to, otherwise they have to address a lot of uncomfortable truths. One is that not humans have the same economic and cultural value. They know this is true, but they have to pretend otherwise for obvious reasons.
