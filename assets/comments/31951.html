        Actually on this one I am cheering for the crazed leftist protesters. This is the first time there has been a mass movement against the tribe. What the tribe is doing to Palestinians they did to Russians and would love to do to us.These protests are forcing the tribe and their Republican  toadies to take off the mask and show that they don’t care about the Constitution. They just care about what is good for the tribe and Israel.Only a conquered nation cares more about a foreign country than their own. The difference is that colonies are forced to submit to the master, we are doing it willingly.Nothing makes sense in American politics if you don’t understand we are a conquered people ruled by people who hate us and both parties are in on it. If it takes people who don’t belong here to bring that to light, well better them than no one.

            This. While Z makes a good point that the focus should be on the fact that none of the protestors should even be here in this country, a more important focus should be put on those who brought them here in the first place.

                My take on Z’s piece is that the people “who brought them here” shouldn’t be here either. The Levant for Levantines, America for whites. Of course, that ship sailed so long ago it actually had sails.

                    Trouble is the first group of Levantines didn’t come over from the Levant or as Levantines, they came over with the other “Germans”, “Russians”, “Poles”, etc. (who all probably never should’ve been allowed into this country in the first place, if you ask me.) It should’ve set off alarm bells that the illiterate among this certain group would sign with a circle rather than an “X”, but they otherwise blended in with the rest of the 19th-Century or early 20th-Century invaders.

                        Yeah, but those invaders, of which I am one, were at least part of the same larger tribe. Even our host here is of Russian heritage.Except for the founding stock, this country is often mislabeled as being European. What it really is, is greater Roman Empire. Our various peoples were compatible within the Roman States and that’s what makes them compatible here. They’re also predominantly Judeo-Christian, another point of commonality. You can build a nation around that. (I’m not even against Latin American immigration, just the amount of it.)That’s very different from what they are bringing in now. And it’s all by design.

                            You shouldn’t ever use Judeo-Christian, it’s never been a thing. Judaism is as alien to Christianity as Islam is. In fact Islam and Judaism have much more in common than any other religions.

                                    Jews and Christians read and interpret them completely differently.  I believe the Torah has excluded some of the blatantly Messianic predictions in the OT such as the last 2 chapters of Daniel.

                                    Not true.
The oldest Biblical texts at the Nash Papyrus, the Dead Sea Scrolls and the silver Ketef Hinnom scrolls, and not one of them is complete, so there is no “word to word translation of Torah.” Such a thing does not exist.The Dead Sea Scrolls are the most comprehensive, but even they don’t include any of Nehemiah or Esther.

This talking point does not understand/has not read the bulk of the OT, nor the fact that Judaism uses a completely separate book to interpret the OT.
Either Christians are wrong or modern Jews are wrong on the OT, but we not both right.

                                    I always figured the OT was included for context, and to prove Jesus fulfilled prophecy and the Law.
Kind of like how America comes out of the Anglo tradition, but the American Constitution supersedes The English Constitution in America. We Americans are no longer Englishmen. Jesus brought a sword to divide. Christians are no longer Jews. But that might be heretical lol.

                                        Christ is the fulfilment of the OT covenant (I wouldn’t use superseded personally, but I get what you are saying).  Jews (and every other person around at the time) had their chance to accept the fulfilment – some took it and became Christian, some rejected it.  So to say “Judeo-Christian” is an oxymoron/contradiction – one is the rejection of the other.  Best analogy I can think of is a fulfilment of a contract: “Sir, here is the Messiah I promised you” – some accept it and say “Thanks”; others say “I don’t want it”.  From the perspective of God, the contract (covenant) has been fulfilled.Saying Christians are not Jews is accurate in one sense, but confuses things in another.  They key is “chosen” status.  By rejecting the fulfilment of the OT covenant, Jews (while remaining Jews) forfeited their chosen status.  Hence, the references to the Church/Christians as the true Israel.

                                            I get the argument about Christians and chosenness, which is why I say my position could be heretical.The way I look at it: Paul was a Jew and a Pharisee. He was born again as a Christian, but imo his prior status as a Jew understandably lingers in his theology, and he was practically the first Christian theologian. The Gospel of Matthew seems written for a Hebrew audience, starting with Jesus’ genealogy. As mentioned, OT proving Jesus’ fulfillment of Law and prophecy. Etc. I wonder what influence these things had on the Christian preoccupation with continuity.People talk about being born again, presumably as Christians and not Jews. People born to Christianity were never Jews. We Gentiles were certainly never Jews. Etc.In any case, it was a radical break. Israel ceased to be a flesh-and-blood nation and became an idea. And, of course, I’m skeptical of the ideal these days lol.

                                The Jews were decent flag-waving Americans overall and not even hostile to Christianity like they are today. Sure, you had some leftists, but they didn’t have much power. Something went haywire beginning in the 1950s, much like how the Greatest Generation gave us the baby boomers. Jews are defined by leftism these days, whereas I don’t think you could say that in the past.

                                        Their local Jews knew the lay of the land and probably were not trying to endlessly scam them or try to take control of them. Jews are not a monolith.

Well, yeah, if you don’t count the Bolsheviks and their fellow travelers in New York City before the Bolshies took over Russia–and afterwards.
Like, oh, I dunno, Trotsky.
Next time you are in that lovely city, you can visit the Trotsky House Museum and tell your story there.

                                        American Jews, to clarify. I understand the history of Jews and left-wing radicalism, but the average American Jew wasn’t nearly as annoying. Like I said in the above post. There are old newspaper clippings that used to be up on an Indiana KKK website where the post-Civil War era KKKs were imploring people not to bother the local Jews.

                                    I won’t deny there are some Jews who are patriotic, etc. and could live compatibly.  But they are the rare exception, and nowhere near the levers of power. You could say the same about any group.  And the problem began way before the 1950s.  The trap was laid long before, 1950s is when the trap was sprung.IMHO the greatest single error was giving the Jews the central banking backed by income tax they wanted in 1913.  The second was falling for the holohoax in the 50s/60s, which they have leveraged as a get out of evil free card ever since.  No other single group has wreaked as much destruction to White society (even blaques – without jewish backing, they would be a contained problem).

                                    He would have understood very well.Speaking to the Pharisees, who are the ancestors of modern-day Jews:Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I came forth from God and am here; for I have not even come on My own, but He sent Me. Why do you not understand what I am saying?It isbecause you cannot listen to My word. You are ofyourfather the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he tells a lie, he speaks from his ownnature,because he is a liar and the father of lies. But because I say the truth, you do not believe Me. Which one of you convicts Me of sin? If I speak truth, why do you not believe Me? The one who is of God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not hearthem,because you are not of God.”John 8:42-47

                                    We don’t use the Old Testament. Christians as whole take the OT way more seriously than modern Jews. Indeed read with any sort of comprehension, nobody would want to really be a Jew.

                                Right, but you’re forgetting the other side of the Mediterranean. We had plenty of immigration from there and that was also part of the Roman Empire. (Lebanon, etc.) Likewise with Eastern Europe, with some of that stretching into places like Armenia and Georgia. That’s why I call it “Greater Roman Empire.”

                                    Yes. This is the next step and it did not get that explicit. Who are/were Greeks, Romans, Slavs and Germanic/Nordic peoples. We are all the same:
Western Europeans an admixture of Western Hunter Gatherers and the Indo-Europeans (Bell Beakers descended from Yamnaya)
Eastern Europeans/Slavs an admixture of Eastern Hunter Gatherers and the same Indo-European/Bell Beaker warrior pastoralists.
We are all the same ethnos with differing levels of Indo-European/Yamnaya/Bell-Beakers. In short, we are all one people and our dominant cultural instituions are Greco-Roman and this is true from the Rus to North America and Australia/New-Zealand.
No more brother wars.

                I have to confess that I am old enough to remember “BDS” as “Bush Derangement Syndrome”, and that was as recently as 2008, a mere 16 years ago.
So I trudged muh way on over to Urban Dictionary, and now I’m seeing:
Big Dick SexBig Dick SyndromeBig Dick Squad
Biden Derangement Syndrome
Big Dick Swinging
Boycott-Divestment-Sanctions
WTF does “Boycott-Divestment-Sanctions” mean, other than embezzling money and laundering it on over to Barry &amp; Michael Obama?
Maybe they can hire a few new lifeguards to make certain that the Cabana Boys don’t drown in the creeks of Martha’s Vineyard?

More specifically, they care about the bribes given them by AIPAC for re-election, and that the Epsteinish photos not be shown.

        When it comes to protesting the savagery of the Israeli state, I don’t think the color of the people protesting really matters. We are talking about a state that is openly genociding a population and daring anyone to do anything about it, while also trying to spark World War III. This goes beyond some brown person who doesn’t belong at Columbia.However, the response makes it clear, as always, that our right to protest only goes as far as the people in charge let it go. It’s clear that protesting the savagery of the Israeli state is off the table. Because they have brought in the people with the swastika signs and they brought in antifa to riot and storm buildings and they brought in the media to photograph it all. So now we are talking about the protestors instead of Israel firing missiles at refugee camps and blowing up children. But how much longer are we going to be able to talk about that without getting prosecuted? The House just passed a bill making it illegal to criticize Jews or Israel, and also making it illegal to say that you are not allowed to criticize Jews or Israel.

            There was a funny exchange in a debate with Fuentes and Barnes where he asked, point blank, whether the world would be better or worse off if Israel was wiped off the map. This was supposed to be a gotcha, but Fuentes just smirked and said “probably better.” It’s too bad he became a cartoon character, because he really did have debating chops.
More and more people are inclined to agree they are a nuisance country, and it’s not just the anti-white, anti-colonialist faction.

But, seeing as how it looks like Biden &amp; Co are getting set to bring all the Palestinians here, I am all for having the Israelis push them into the sea before that happens.
I can’t blame the Israelis;  The Palestinians have proven incapable of civilized behavior.
We did the same thing with our own savages.  Life has been good since Wounded Knee.***

                            It was obvious when this started that we get the Palestinians dumped on us and Israel gets to keep its ethnostate.
One of the principal aims of the assault on Gaza is to create refugees for the goyim to inherit.
And you say the Palestinians aren’t capable of civilized behavior  (which is probably true), but you think the Israelis are?

            My normie or left-of-center associates have been telling me that Netanyahu is “a butcher” and “went too far”, which I surprised me…they get their opinions from normie news sources of course, so evidently there is a lot of anti-Israel talk on the normie news networks. I wonder if this antisemitism bill is a way to clamp down on American media, which has gone a bit rogue here.

                I feel like they (AIPAC/ADL/DHS, etc.) told the media to shut up after the food aid convoy. It really seems that was a turning point, where indifference to the situation or even sympathy for Israel turned to anger, and it is when these protests started to spring up. There is something about dropping bombs on aid workers trying to get food to people you are intentionally starving that hits differently. I don’t know how much the media is talking about it, because I don’t watch the media. I know the normie right-wing sites like Fox News and NY Post aren’t talking about Gaza at all right now, but I also learned from CNN’s website, after scrolling a bunch, that Israel bombed a refugee camp, killing 11 people including children under 5 years old. So, there is that.

            Who cares what Israel is doing to them?  Really, this is what gets you fired up?  How about the ethnic displacement of White people?  These anti-Israel protestors hate White people just as much as they hate Jews.  They are not on our side.  They willNEVERdefend our right to our own countries.
I could not care less about the Palestinians other than to the extent they can be used for propaganda purposes.  Frankly, a nuke going off in the middle of it is the best solution to this otherwise unsolvable problem.

                        Most Normies are not aware of the Chosenites as a force working their malevolent destruction. They are atomized in infancy, and heretofore they haven’t grasped what is happening to them.These protests are forcing Hand Tipping such as we have not seen in our lifetimes as the mask is flung aside like a Jew divesting himself of a BLT with extra mayo.We can rejoice because the Whites being displaced are watching all this unfold and waking up abruptly in numbers. Or we can rant about the kids these days, D3R, and about how we don’t like EITHER side!!!!How about that hep cat Lawrence Welk, huh?

                            Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is just another enemy.  This freakshow is not demonstrating anything to anyone.  This is not waking up White people to their displacement.I have no side in the Jewish-Palestinian fight.  Either side is bad for Whites.  These very same people would easily be doing an anti-White “protest” instead of protesting Israel. The fact that there are so many of these “brown” people in the US, especially in our universities is a giant L for White people.  The only good thing that can really come of it is if it were possible to stop foreign aid to Israel, which ain’t going to happen.OK Boomer.

                        Tars, I get what you’re saying. I do not identify with either tribe. These are not my people.One, to clear the air of this issue, the irony is the *ews are exterminating the Palestinians. Wow, what an inversion for the Levant *ews! That’s what they want. Second, *ews Hate Hate Hate Muslins, are going to cut the throat of Ms. Red Heifer and shove it up the Muslim rectum. They want the Temple Mount and Palestine empty of the other. Third, Muslims hate the Jews, they hate everyone else and particularly whitey and us. This is a Muslim thing. They picture us as Daniel Pearl all headless in Gaza, doesn’t matter who you are as that’s the endgame if you don’t submit. Look up Sabbatai Zevi 1666 who went all turban to keep his head, while secretly maintaining Sabbatian *ewish identity and Kabbalistic practices. The Zionists don’t get a pass in this headless game either as look up the Noahide Laws, how the Zionists are wanting these laws passed here, and ultimately if you don’t submit, well, just don’t lose your head.These are not my people! Ultimately, they will blow each other up. Black tile, White tile, Let’s you and him fight! Try and juggle more than one ball in the air, and do your best to stay out of the way. Put your energy toward surviving what the near-future brings. Gather with like-minded. Best to you.

                Yes, it absolutely does get me fired up, because I take the sixth commandment seriously. I take the idea of the USA gleefully supporting and defending genocide on behalf of a foreign nation to be a grave evil. What Israel is doing is outrageous and a violation of everything I value and hold sacred. The fact that they are doing it to brown people that are theoretically alien to me is irrelevant.
It’s called principles.

        As you say Z, it would take a heart of stone to not laugh at how the hubris of God’s Chosen has come back to bite them in the ass. It turns out that being able to play the “white when convenient, Jew when convenient” gane requires some amount of intellectual horsepower, and the 85 IQ imports simply don’t have the thinking capacity to see anything but the white skin.When I worked at a university I heard the “is it good for the Jews?” gag more times than I have fingers, and now it’s time for white Dirt People to ask themselves a similar question, “is it good for non-Cloud whites?”As for these protestors/counterprotestors, there is one of those head meme going around that says it all.“I hope you both kill each other.”

        You know a bill is bad when the Daily Wire, of all orgs, is railing against it. Mind you, they’re doing so because it’s so over-the-top and clownish is makes the pro-Israel side look like a bunch of lunatics, but when those guys have a better grasp of the political winds than our ruling class, it’s getting pretty bad.It’s also funny how fast House Speaker Ned Flanders cucked on everything. This is why the accusation thrown at evangelicals about supporting “immoral” people holds no weight. Beneath the soft platitudes and God-talk, they are, at best, limp-wristed, and more often traitors.

                Matt Walsh had an excellent take down of that ridiculous bill. I was thinking I can’t believe Shapiro is letting him do this. My guess is Shapiro knows the bill will only shed more light on the “tribe,” and their preferred victim hierarchy status and would amount to very bad PR for the tribe.

            I don’t think that is why they are, “against”, it. I think it is controlled opposition. They have lost a lot of credibility and this while everything of the past year is fresh in their audience’s minds would likely be the end of them. Remember they are still trying to repair their audience.This is the time to attach memes to all Daily Wire posts relentlessly memeing Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-Ben’s two most relevant statements:I don’t care about the browning of AmericaI am here in America to help my country, Israel.Biden’s platform is, “Finish The Job!!!!” We AmeroEuropeans must take up our own fight for our cause and crush the legitimacy of the controlled opposition with the attitude and will to, “Finish The Job”, on our terms.Carpe Diem

        This is the key takeaway: The protesters see themselves as antiwhite, not antisemitic. That is why they will eventually focus on the Republicans, who are indeed be clowning themselves with their over the top Zionism. “Biden” will slither out of this by calling for Netanyahu’s resignation and possibly prosecution (but not until after Rafah has been annihilated). He will laud the new, liberal Israeli government as dedicated to peace, while importing thousands (maybe hundreds of thousands) of expelled Palestinians.
As usual, Republicans will be left holding the bag.

        I got a kick out of this video recorded after a Seattle Mariners game last weekend…https://rumble.com/v4si188-mariners-fans-just-trying-to-leave-a-game-monday-night-had-to-deal-with-unh.htmlA bunch of privileged white Liberal Seattle residents got a front row seat (with their kids in tow) to the America they voted for.  A lot of them have bemused and confused looks on their faces as their brains try to square that stupid punk black kid with their romanticized White Savior suburban dilettante stereotypes.i wrote at CTH the other day that I often root for both teams to lose, but rarely get my wish.  On college campuses this week, both teams are losing, and it is glorious.

            Disgusting. Those weak-chinned milquetoast cucks just stood there while a small handful of ferals beat on them. If it were four White punks against a trainload of blacks, they’d be scraping pale remains off the platform after the stomping they took. Memo to Seattle, and every other gentile, White-majority cloister – Tribe up or die. There is no one coming to save you from the savages who are hell-bent on your destruction.

                You have to assume that the black hoodlum has a gun or knife and low impulse control.  Your duty as a parent (several boys with dads) is to protect your family.  The people in the train aren’t armed – baseball stadiums have metal detectors.
its a pretty good example of Derb’s “The Talk” column in 2012.  Don’t put yourself in a situation where you’re likely to encounter a group of young black males.

        Z man’s post is proof positive regarding my comment from a few days back. Young, white, males have no business attending college any longer.Four years minimum discrimination and being told “All white men are responsible for all the ills of the world” and that they need to be “eradicated.” For lots of debt and little prospects for gainful employment using that piece of paper in the “DEI” corporate world. It would be a miracle for a young white male to escape with any semblance of sanity.With the astounding irony that it was white men of European descent who CREATED the university system! So these ingrates from every third world shit hole, and batshit crazy white women and “turn it up to 11” to quote Nigel Tufgnel, and screech and howl all the more now that they’ve gotten everything they’ve been bitching about for 60 plus years.I absolutely love that the ppl who created this mess, both left and right, are finally having to come to terms with what they created now that the chickens have come home to roost.I hang around a drag racing forum, 99.99% white guys and you wouldn’t believe how pro Jew anti hama’s they are.I went into one thread and said, “I don’t care about either side and why should any of you, I don’t have a horse in the race and neither do any of you,” and they lost their freakin minds!I replied they’ve been fighting for thousands of years, and will be fighting till Christ returns, what’s in it for you or America?”Grillers all! 😂

            “Young, white, males have no business attending college any longer.”This is way too harsh and self-defeating.  Attending a private college or a University is key to advanced employment in most STEM fields, precisely what will generate the next (White) generation taking their rightful place in commercial areas of power and influence.  Nothing wrong with the “trades” as we call them (I hate the term myself, it’s “othering” and somewhat demeaning), but we need White folk running the show—not just blue collar workers supporting a basic infrastructure for the benefit of non-Whites. We are not to be relegated to high quality slaves.What I suggest is that well qualified Whites look for colleges and universities that do not indulge in the fantasy of DIE, and barring that we develop our own educational infrastructure of such.  There are institutions—still to this day—which do not indulge in “woke” nonsense.  Yeah, they are not the “Ivies” and one needs to be careful not to fall for smaller, private colleges like Evergreen, but they do exist.

                AMEN! There’s nothing romantic about living the life of Joe Lunchpail. It’s hard on your body and does not these days get you into the best of social circles. That reverberates in all areas of your life, and often leads to living the life of that “coal miner’s daughter” in the movies.I’m not saying this as a snob. I’m saying this as the son of a union carpenter, one who took my brother and me to work with him to give us a taste of what he does. He did that so we wouldn’t end up doing what he does for a living. And it worked pretty well, because we don’t work in the trades.

                    Yes, indeed. My father was a skilled Blue Collar worker. From that I got a grounding in hard work through example. Alas I was a disappointment to him when I went to college. Best he could say to me after HS was you need to “do something”, which really meant come work with me in my “trade”.He never allowed me to tell him what I did in school or at employment. He simply said “I don’t understand these things” and shut down any further conversation. That I guess is the proverbial father-son conflict they base hit songs on. 😉 I’m proud of my background and still show others examples of my father’s work. It is understandable and has meaning to the “common” man. To this day, you can see examples of it in common use.My work is, in the long run, pretty meaningless and will little be remembered. In that, my father was—as usual—correct. On the other hand, it produced a good living, a relatively easy lifestyle, and landed me here in retirement. Things could be worse, and are for most of my cohort (Boomers).

                        I also understand the satisfaction of being able to do things with your hands. In fact, having a father like mine is why I am pretty handy myself, though nowhere near his level of skill. But things have changed way too much in society. The worst part about working in the trades is that when I was growing up, decent people with normal families was not uncommon. Now, it seems like you’re signing up for a life of social dysfunction. Divorces, drugs, tats, baby mamas and all the other things we find distasteful about the underclass seem to predominate. I’m not signing my kid up for that.But as I have also said, we have to have a seat at the table and like it or not, plumbers don’t get that seat. Abdicating consigns us to serfdom.

                            If I could give more than one up vote, you would get it, Nick.Those who disagree with your analysis of the current plight of Blue Collar workers should read “Coming Apart” by Charles Murray.  It’s pushing a couple of decades old, but he looked at the stat’s comparing White academic educated and Blue Collar workers wrt dysfunction.  It’s a horror and sad.All I can say is, “Look at the source.”  The Blue Collar background of my childhood was anything *but* dysfunctional.  The institutions that made this country great were still in force: marriage, church, unions—were still ascendant.  Today, not so much.

                            I’ve often thought of such things with others commenting here.  An amazing range of backgrounds, but more important  *wisdom* gleaned from life experience.  So much so that if you came to this group thinking you’re “hot stuff” because of your academic resume, you quickly are humbled.
I was once told by my major professor, “If you are the smartest man in the room, you’re in the wrong room!”  He was right, and I must acknowledge I’ve never had that problem….  🙁

Was this anti white man hate going on? Was DIE hiring the norm?Im banking the answer is a big fat no!Gotta be a leftist sticking to your guns despite all evidence to the contrary.

                        I merely compare the life my dad had to the life me and my brother have. And it’s not just that, you’re also consigning your kid to have to deal with and marry a bunch of lowlifes. It’s the tatted class with baby mamas, mixed bloodlines and all the social dysfunction you could ever ask for. If you can’t see that, you’re blind.When you see some fat woman at the grocery store toting around her little halfrican brood, it comes from the working class. What college educated types don’t do that by and large. That’s what you’re marrying into.I don’t care if people downvote me. Knock yourself out. I will stick to my guns.

                            College degree or no college degree, has nothing to do with your word salad scenario. Men aren’t getting married white collar, blue collar, beach bum, crackhead. Young white men aren’t even fucking these women anymore because they don’t want to deal with their entitled wack a doodle b.s.. The no one’s having sex stats for millennials and Gen Z are common knowledge. The whamens are screaming to high heaven all over social media because “they can’t get no man.” Get out of your stinky ivory tower. What you see at Walmart are dead beat unemployed and welfare cases. And fuck you and your smug hipster ass!

                    The fucking world has changed. Get with the program. Over abundance of “degreed” workers, shortage of skilled tradesmen “supply and demand,” skilled trades wages going up,” office cubicle schmucks wages stagnant,” if you haven’t been replaced by a DEI hire. Cost of college way way up. Simple economics.On top of the current “political climate” on college campus’s and the “white men need not apply” hiring in white collar environments.Skilled trades rarely have to deal with HR Karen hiring practices.They can’t play the DEI game   or the A.I. game in skilled trades. Or small business’s who rely on skilled trades will die.

                            “Jewish mothers don’t push their kids to be welders.”Nick and Vinny, stop talking past each other.  You’re both right.  There’s plenty of overlap between your positions.As to the above quote, is the problem rather that we all don’t push our children (qualifier: to the extent needed) to be good and decent people in a fallen world?  And by expansion, to recognize such in others—like a potential spouse?I recognize exactly what you say Vinny, but refuse to believe there are not as many *good* women around as good men.  Train your sons to be good men and they will “find” good women.

                Yes!! We must not forfeit our position. The enemy would love nothing more than for us to make this fatal and finalizing own goal. This guy had some good ideas about home schooling and the nature of the curriculum. (https://periheliuslux.substack.com/p/service-is-superior-to-persuasion)It makes sense to get our kids out of the wretched public/private school system unless you can guarantee a curriculum free of anti-white poison from pre-K – 12, but have them go to college prepared to be the top lawyers, doctors, engineers, business managers and to do intra-ethnic networking. We must not forfeit power and influence and we must send our youth to college as the most well-prepared well-rounded technically advanced statesmen of the future.We must be resolved to dominate the future. The ideal scenario would be to cross network our tradesmen with our white collar class. Then we can interlink white guilds in the trades and contracts given out by our professional class and political class. The future is ours if we choose to build it for ourselves.

                    “The ideal scenario would be to cross network our tradesmen with our white collar class.”Yes.  A thousand times yes.  But if you are a White Collar worker, perhaps second, or third generation, don’t get ahead of yourself.  We need to instill/maintain a respect for the working man—and by that I mean Blue Collar trades, or whatever.  That someone in the trades may be a lowlife is his problem, most are not.  There is dignity in all work if it means you support yourself and family doing whatever you can.  We have enough parasites in society, thank you.I am fortunate to be first generation White Collar, but careful to never denigrate my heritage in front of the children.  I expect the same of them.Yeah, I’m a Mike Roe fan…

                        Yes. My point was that all would be held in esteem. The idea is to bolster our blue and white collar classes in economically and then socially cooperative relationships.
The thinking is that our white collar class would advocate for our blue collar class in racial solidarity. It is a tall order given how the cloud collar class has so thoroughly betrayed their folk. Perhaps a new arrangement can be made given the perils we will be facing together.
In short, I agree with you.

                No point in going to college unless you are actually going to use the degree for a profession, e.g. accounting, law, engineering, etc. Most union “workers” (if you can call their entitled, cosseted lazing around on government-funded building sites “work”) make far more than most degree-holders. Get a degree in African Devlopment and you will likely end up as a lowly clerk getting your maxxed-out credit card rejected every weekend. Get a trade and you will always be in demand, whatever happens to the union.

                    Jannie, absolutely.  To get a college degree simply to be “credentialed” is a mistake and leads to what we’ve termed here a “surplus of elites”.  That was a problem even in my early days at university 50 years ago, although then the numbers of tertiary degree holders was much less.Today, the numbers of people with useless degrees are a joke.  They graduate and are given pieces of worthless paper attesting to their completion of “studies” in faux disciplines.  These newly minted “elites” hit the “job market” only to find limited, or no employment, which doesn’t pay their bills or provide their anticipated lifestyle.  They become embittered and disillusioned and ripe pickings for Leftist hustlers.

        Amusingly, this has the conservative commentariat chanting “antisemitism” even louder, sort of like how English speakers shout at foreign fast-food workers.While a side issue, it is hilarious to watch Con, Inc., get the sadz and twist themselves into a know when their leftwing overlords explode in an internal spat. Picking sides is so hard because it makes one of those groups mad! The Con, Inc., types are trying to no avail to label someone to their Right like Tucker Carlson as a Neo-Nazi but that also means some leftist faction still will be pissed off at them. Professional virtue signalers such as Jay Nordlinger avoid the topic altogether since he realizes the entirety of the Left cannot be pleased with his usual “we are not like those nasty Dirt People” act.It is positive that Normie has noticed that when he is savaged by savages, it is universally celebrated, and elected Republicans only pipe up when their Cloud paymasters come under fire. There even is a rift within what passes as the American Right over the abominable bill Congress passed to criminalize traditional Christianity and free speech. A really great meme shows NYPD cops kneeling before BLM rioters juxtaposed with them advancing toward the Columbia savages with twist ties in hand. Those cops are all Mike Johnson, Mitch McConnell, and Mitt Romney.As well as amusing, this leftwing civil war is an important event. Quite a few Normies finally seem to realize who rules them, and the utterly predictable proposal to bring to these shores the Palestinians who have been previously labeled terrorists will ignite anti-Israel sentiment even among factions on the Right. It is amazing how an event out of left field can reset everything unexpectedly, and this seems to have done so. Short the GOP, likely on its last leg as a national party, along with Israel, also looking at its last reel. The long con is ending.Also, if you get odds, take the Chicago convention being canceled. There are no Daleys anymore since the evil of whiteness became such a thing. These protests will finish the job Covid started.

I tell them, I care not one iota about 2 fighting groups of people whose 2 religions both say you shouldn’t eat pork. I personally think if you are of such a religion, you are already a piss-poor American and I can care less about your “problems”.

        The GOP is the party of feckless, clueless goofballs who can no longer play the role for which they exist.
The two sponsors of the bill have raked in over $2 million from AIPAC in their short time in Washington, and likely will never have to do a day’s work again in their lives. They may be feckless, but they sure as hell have f*cked us, and for all the complaining that I and others do, we keep paying their checks.

        This is what I have been looking for. Finally, a discussion about the left eating its own.  This is the most interesting aspect of the Gaza protests to me. Popcorn time.I don’t take offense at the idea that two tribes from the Levant are fighting each other. I have become interested in genetics and have learned that Jews are half Levantine and half European. Our paternal lineage is from the Levant and our maternal lineage is from Europe, the Mediterranean to be specific. We are basically half white (but 0% Anglo Saxon). This is why we tend to look more white (and in my case a LOT more white) than Palestinians and other Muslims from the region.The fact that Jews tend to look more white and are often perceived as being white is no small matter. It’s a main reason why leftists think of Jews as privileged whites…even if many Jews would prefer to be considered part of the non-white faction. I also think this is an underrated reason why Republicans tend to be pro-Jewish, they perceive us as their fellow whites not realizing how different our DNA is from themselves.

            The refusal of the right to recognize the nature of the police has already got a bunch of our guys (and MAGA normies) killed, and it’s going to get many, many, many more.In exchange for obedience, cops are allowed to borrow a little bit of the master’s power and live above and outside the law, to know some of power’s secret life. That is both the means and the END of their vocation. It doesn’t matter who the master is or what he commands.Every cop (or soldier, or etc.) will slaughter your children if anybody who outranks him—including, presently, The Jews™—tells him to. There are no exceptions, no “good cops,” no “white hats,” no oath keepers. They are defined by not being those things.“So if we win, they’ll obey us.”We did not win.

        The Cloud People created and nurtured these Frankenstein monsters for decades. It was fine when they were attacking right wing white deplorables — the wretched Dirt People — in their Antifa and BLM incarnations. However, now they’ve broken their bonds.

            I’m of the opinion no faction really is in charge at any given time and the anti-Israel/pro-Israel dust-up is more a symptom than a cause. I always give the edge to the Puritans, and one possibility is they are using their feral children and non-white pets against the Jews to remind them who is in charge or at least supposed to be in charge. While as Z noted all of these people hate us, their infighting is good for us, as is flushing out who the GOP actually serves.

        Rightly or wrongly, I blame the Jews as the main drivers of flooding this country with POCs. The fact that they’ve lost their base of support in the process is absolutely hilarious to me. Protestant cucks support Israel. Catholics and third worlders, not so much

                    The Orthodox are not under Peter and therefore not Catholic. EO in the US is generally the refuge of the Protestants who couldn’t stomach swimming the Tiber. They will discover at some point that they have joined national churches that are not interchangeable and not one Church.In any event still protestant heritage Americans will have lost every other belief, even in God, but will cling to the bitterness the Catholics done them wrong. It’s as American as apple pie and baseball.Also in fairness to the Protestants, American Catholicism is badly infected with philosemitism. You don’t want to know how many times I have to try to warn people off of adopting Judaic customs in my own little circle.

                        Catholic comes from the Greek word catholicos which means universal. (As in, the universal faith.) At one time, all of the patriarchs were archbishops, with the archbishop in Rome being what was considered the first among equals. (Most prestigious.) Rome was just another city where in archbishop was located. Rome at some point decided that they needed to control the other churches and the other churches did not want to be controlled by Rome.Otherwise, the theology is 99.5% the same. It’s only outward appearances and customs that make them seem different.A Serbian priest was giving a lecture on this once. He said the only reason we don’t call ourselves Catholics is because the Romans took the word first.

        Nothing screams pre-revolution like the drool fest at the WH “correspondants” dinner. So much vulgarity, bad taste, self-congratulation and supplication packed into one hour.  So much bad hair and ill -fitting garb! Even Ghaddafi, dolled up in his most campish caftan, came back from the dead to accompany Kampala. The scene was right out of Dr Zhivago, where the shuffling peasant rabble looks through the frosted palace windows at the Czar’s ball underway – well, you know what scene came next.

        My saintly mother told me, several years later, that in 1968 she was seriously worried that the USA was falling apart.  In a way she was right.  It just took several decades, with some band-aids like Reaganism patched on, prolonging the agony.  I’ll never tire of ranting about how the Republicans criminally ignored educational and other substantial cultural issues.  They weren’t always so craven, at least to the degree that they are now.Recently I watched a Bald and Bankrupt video, touring Romania and Bulgaria.  He noted that it’s understandable, with the gutting of industry and jobs in these countries, why some older people would yearn for Ceausescu.  After Communism fell in Eastern Europe, it seems like a horrific globalist demon rushed in with terrible consequences,  linking up with those on the Left who would overthrow the West.  This weird ruling combination seems unprecedented in its hatred of the ruled.  The relationship between the ultra-wealthy and the Left is much debated.  It will be fascinating to see how this plays out.

            I guess a better way of putting it is that the Globalists saw their chance in the early 90’s and pounced.  And the Left kept termiting away non-stop, converging in their interests with the former.

        My good friend Dan Bongino has done 2 podcasts in a row in which he rants passionately in defense of Zionism and rales against the “antisemitic” protestors. Every second sentence he shouts “kill the Jews” and genuinely believes that this slogan is somehow supportive of the pro Zionist propaganda agenda. Can someone please explain to me the logic of that technique of persuasion? Such is the nature of how far we have fallen. The new incarnation of Rush Limbaugh has nothing better to do than shamelessly suck Netanyaho’s dick in public and expect his followers to applaud. That is modern Conservatism in a nut sack.

        There’s a worthwhile debate with Gavin McInnes, Fuentes, and Adam King that made rounds a few months ago. Adam King is essentially a Christian hating Jewish guy and was bringing up all his beefs with Christianity. The part that made it go viral (at least on our side of the divide) was when asked point blank, Well if one had to go, Islam or Christianity, which would you choose?” King, without hesitation says, “Christianity.” Gavin was dumbfounded and walked off the set.I know it’s one person, and one debate, but I think his view encompasses more Jews than most realize. I used to Pooh-pooh the idea of them preferring Muslims, considering the Muslims literally want to kill them all and we’ve been overwhelmingly generous to them, but there’s just some underlying hatred, jealousy, and/or fear of Christians that defies logic.

            The usual reaction to a cringing coward is to hate him *more* for his lack of the will to fight. Muslims get respect because they show the Jews a good honest hatred. Cucked Christians are rightly regarded as weak kneed cowards.

        I’ve started to believe that at least part of the reason for the GOPs and Con., Inc.’s recent obsession over “anti-Semitism” is due to the fact that they’re also still mapping out the plan to remove Trump from the ballot and inprison and bankrupt him and they don’t want to tip their hand.Amongst all the gum-flapping and ink spilling by the so-called “right”, there’s only the barest mention of the attempts by the regime to trump up legal charges against Trump and summarily send him to prison to be “Chauvin’ed”.  Even &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; one of those Con., Inc. poseurs mentions it, it’s always ridiculously something along the lines of “this is bad for the business climate in NY” not that it’s evil and un-American on it’s face.  This yapping about campus protests is just a way to ignore what’s happening to Trump and also keep their powder dry up until the point at which the final removal of Trump from society takes place.  When that happens they’ll all be given talking points to dutifully parrot about Muh’ Principles and “that’s not who we are”, but until then it’s best to stay silent so you don’t have a paper trail to answer for in the run-up to November.  If these campus upheavals hadn’t come along, Con. Inc. would still have had to invent something else to obsess over during the course of the summer.

        It should be obvious to everyone here by now that Soros funded these protest groups precisely to generate the political environment in which the odious antisemitism bill would sail through Congress. It’s the same game plan the Israel played in funding Hamas.
It takes time to write a bill like that. This plan has been in the works for weeks, if not months.

            This bill is not that big of a deal, nor is it elaborate. Five pages total. But it was written last year, you’re right about that. The date on it is Oct. 2023. It just fine tunes the ways you can get expelled from college for saying naughty words. Which doesn’t really seem like something Soros would go to all this trouble for.

        This is a good time, for those who hide their power level on a daily basis, to start linking Marxism and immigration to those with ears to hear. This is a great time to start sullying the idea of immigration.Most every normie dislikes Marxism on some level. But they alsolikeimmigration, on some level. Tell them that the antisemitism (which they dislike, on some level) is happening because of a blend of Marxist indoctrination and the importation of foreigners many of whom are not kind to Israel like Americans are. Except for heritage Americans, most of the world is anti-Zionist, or at least doesn’t care.Tell Normie: Doyouwant to live in a country where nobody cares about Israel and Christian ideas of a war before the Second Coming? Doyouwant the country to forget “Never Forget”?Obviously getting Normie to become anti-immigration is much easier than to become antisemitic, so immigration is a much better issue to make scales fall from people’s eyes. Besides, our civilizational problems are more closely linked to immigration and native replacement, not the JQ. In a generation Jews won’t matter, as Hindus and Muslims and (Catholic) Hispanics will own much of the West.

        This is a superb article that should be required reading for all white high school students who are planning to go to college. They should be fully apprised of the anti-white maelstrom they’ll endure, not only at Columbia and the other Ivies, but the vast majority of less exalted institutions as well. (If they’re accepted.)Speaking of which, these anti-Israel protests are not just happening at the big-name schools. They’re also taking place at the tertiary state school in Texas where I work. Granted, nobody’s occupied the administration building, taken a dump on the provost’s desk or burned a box of bagels in effigy, but they’ve been camped in the “free speech area” with their Muzzie banners and their placards moaning about genocide.Speaking of which, outside of “antisemitism,” is any term more overused than “genocide”? I suppose it’s supposed to be a rhetorical talisman intended to galvanize the various dupes and loons into righteous fury and action.

                Yes, it’s a soft, slo-mo genocide. You know that, and I know that, but you tell it to most heritage Americans and they’ll think you’re bananas. You’d have to explain in great detail why it is genocide and even then most of them will be a bit skeptical.

                    It’s incredible how the (((Sacklers))) reduced the white population by a good two million vs what it otherwise would have been today, down to the level of not just targeting specific geographical areas and populations but specific doctors, and nobody can even see it for what it really was. Even while they acknowledge that the (((Sacklers))) so targeted them.

        Off topic: Steve Sailer was bullied into pleading with the (((elites))) for the sake of lowly whites.
Steve NEVER would have written something like if righteous bullies like our Silly Citizen weren’t jamming Steve’s head into the dirty toilet bowl every day.
https://chroniclesmagazine.org/view/the-hate-that-dare-not-speak-its-name/
I hope that I had some small part in bullying Steve into acknowledging the obvious truth:
‘Conservatives prefer to label anti-white racism “Communism,” “Marxism,” or some other 20th-century “ism” that’s hardly relevant in 2024.’
I wish that bullying was so often healthy, but it is.

            Unz himself popped into the comments to mock him for losing two thirds of his readership over covid, Ukraine, and general establishment ass-kissing. All that could be put down to nerd error—believing that numbers are truth, merit will out, bad consequences are unintended, etc.—but he’s also become girlishly defensive of Biden, personally, so it’s probably an age-related hormonal problem. Acting mildly annoyed at some Jews for doing something that looks kinda dumb (it isn’t) won’t fool anybody.

        “They do not want you to notice the two alien tribes from the Levant fighting it out on the college campus.”Yep, I struggle with faith. 2000 year Hebrew civil war. They have their king killed, they lose their temple and their country.There’s your left (Jews) and your right (Christians). Or anti-zionists and zionists, or however we formulate it today. Your Judeo-Christianity.“They were also waving around an Israel flag, but that was trimmed from the scene.”At least how little stake we Gentiles have in the question (the JQ!) is becoming obvious. Yeah, boomers are of a certain time and still play the role. So we get to lose our king, our temple, and our country— for what? I’ve read the book, and the ending is a cliffhanger. You just have to wait for the sequel. The Second Coming, the next life, whatever.At least medieval Christianity had cathedrals to build and a Holy Land to conquer. It had meaning in this life, something to offer to Gentiles, was a little more pagan in outlook, if I can say.The antisemites aren’t wrong, but then they jump into the fray as if it’s their fight. Many Christians avowedly fight for others’ interests. More semite-on-semite violence if you ask me. My head hurts. Trying to hold on.

        “Thirty percent of the undergrad student body in Columbia is foreign. Less than half of the student body is classified as white and half of those identify as Jewish. If you are the typical white person, Columbia University may as well be located in another solar system. It is not just a foreign place. It is an alien place that rests on hostility toward you.”This is NYC we’re talking about and the city is not really white, not like the NYC of “Breakfast at Tiffany’s.” Given the outsized Jewish population of NYC, one would expect a quarter of the undergrads to be Jewish. I think all of the ranking universities on the East Coast have an outsized number of Jewish students. With regard to foreign students, just about all the ranking US universities make a pitch for foreign students — they typically pay top whack for tuition (no in-state fees for them) and in any case the math, physics, engineering, and comp sci departments would probably have to be shuttered without them. Outside of the money part, these universities have been one of many tools to create a global governing elite (aka cloud people) whose members know one another and who have had the same values drummed into them at university.With regard to the current tenuous relationship between Jewish activist groups and other non-white anti-white activist groups, it behooves us to keep in mind that the some of the funding and probably most of the organisation and ideology of anti-white wokeism comes from the Jewish groups. Without Jews, the woke movement is like a headless body. The current tension arguably owes much to the ambivalent self-definition of Jews: when it suits them, they want to be seen as part of the establishment and “honorary whites”; at other times they want to be seen as in opposition to the establishment and one of its victims.And this is similar to the self-definition of Israel: at times it wants to be seen as part of the West; at other times its raison d’etre is as a homeland for Jews suffering from anti-semitism in Europe.

            I’m afraid that is incorrect. Geographic diversity is a big thing in the admissions policies of highly selective schools. What that means is they attempt to get a student body comprised of people from all over the world. Note that there is nothing in that policy preventing Finkels from being wildly overrepresented at Columbia. A guy named Milton Axelrod from northeastern Wyoming still helps Columbia’s geographical diversity quotient.

        I consider it impolite to mention other web sites when posting here but there is a site, which many might read, run by a supposed conservative libertarian, that appears to have moved it’s headquarters to Tel Aviv. They have gone bat crap crazy posting repeatedly about this issue and how the protesters are all rat faced vermin antisemites, etc. etc. The mask has come off. During the Summer of Floyd , these conservatives made barely a noise about the numerous riots. Now, they literally want to eradicate the 1st Amendment.

            Unfortunately, picking “our side” really isn’t an option right now as the USA is (A) sending tens of billions of dollars to Israel so they can murder Palestinians, (B) planning to take in Palestinians as refugees so Israel can annex Gaza, (C) shielding Israel diplomatically from all criticism and accountability for its behavior, and (D) defending Israel with its own military forces, and (E) forcing its vassals to do the same.

        Blunt language is called for should dullards like Mike Anton and VDH be reading you or have quotes forced under their noses. So,…The civilian ZOGbots were finally sent in yesterday to clear the pro-Gaza camp… At other colleges, civilian ZOGbots continue to battle with protestors…andSupport for Israel and Jewish supremacy remain strong with old whitetards, esp. those who need to have their government benefits terminated,…andThe shuffling husk…has been trying to do what it exists to do, which is get whitetards to focus on the how and why,…andThey do not want you to notice the two Levantine tribes of Semitic supremacists fighting it out on college campuses.andthis sort of boomer bait always works to distract middle-class whitetards.andThe idiot, a rightless papist, who sponsored this monstrosity…Burn GZAE burn, and take the Global Liberal American Empire with you.

            Steve, I’m responding to your comment from a few days ago about “tribing up.”
If we don’t “tribe up”, what do you suggest instead?
Please don’t say that we must wait to be saved by the cavalry of brown and black natural conservatives.

        I think Z is wrong on this one. Yes neither group should be here, but that is not the issue. The issue is a schism in the ruling class and Regime. As near as I can make out, Obama/Soros/CIA/State/NGOs are fueling and funding and organizing the protests, and the Hillary! camp is equivocating “fine people on both sides.” etc.Of note is that the leader of the Columbia Group is some AWFL to be, her mother (AWFL) is the number 3 person at the State Dept.Why the Right Always Loses: it focuses on past grudges, feuds, “being right” instead of a forthright appreciation of just how bad things are and bad they will get. We (ordinary White people) are on a sinking ship in the middle of the ocean and the lifeboat is rickety, not seaworthy, and filled with awful refuse. It nevertheless is a lifeboat. International Rescue and the Thunderbirds, Superman  and Green Lantern, and the Avengers are not coming to save us.What we have now, by a miracle of God (and the inevitable circular firing squad of the Colors of Benneton) is a lifeboat.First, Wall Street now fully understands Trump was just the beginning, not the end, Letitia James and Alvin Bragg would like their stuff to give to their pals. They are leaving NYC for Miami, and stopping hiring out of the Ivies and instead hiring out of Southern Football schools on the theory that while some White frat guy won’t ever get hired in the SEC, Miss Muslimina from Columbia who will go to the SEC will take her inside knowledge to take their stuff and give it to her jihad buddies. We could soon see the Ivies being Muslimina dominated (few Islamic rage boys on campus protests) going after Wall Street which in turn would be Southern/((())).Second, the Soros led chaos is not going to stop. There will be protests spreading into the suburbs, and unlike BLM where AWFL moms could endlessly and cost-less virtue signal against White men who they HATE HATE HATE, most of the country really HATES Muslims who generate dislike to hate wherever they go. Dog not barking: almost no conversion of White males into Islam anywhere. Muslims don’t want them (what does that tell you) and White guys really HATE Islam on a genetic level.Third, the House bill is brilliant. [Paris is worth a Mass.] It forces the Colors of Benetton to choose a particular color over another. Causing dis-unity and fighting among their coalition. Yes its anti-American, America ceased to exist for a very long time so it does not matter. Its why Nadler came out against it — it lets Muslims know they are not #1 and will cause them to Jihad.Fourth, now that White males have been purged from the Ivies, it is time to enjoy the power struggles between the Houses of Obama and Clinton, reflected upon angry young Musliminas who will soon be running things and (((Wall Street))) which has money. Popcorn popped!Random observation: from what I have seen on video of the Columbia, USC, UCLA protests, they seem to be in descending order: Musliminas, young woke White women, various anti-fa mercenaries, a few mystery meat dudes. No ordinary White guys: the anti-fa look like longtime heroin addict homeless junkies.In summary, I think for ordinary White guys like me without money, power, or connections (Sailer has at least the latter and has IMHO been told that Biden is guaranteed to “win” and that Hillary’s deprogramming camps are a slam dunk — and yes she really said it) … Well for me I will take ANY chance I can get. If it is 1938 and I’m on the SS St. Louis, I am getting off at the Dominican Republic and taking my chances. And I think it is 1938 and we are all on that boat. Yes the Dominican sucks. Beats being dead.

        If these youngsters, in viewing mainstream media material, also see it through the lens of this post-truth period and accordingly interpret that channel as proffering only the inverse of the truth, they may have found other alternate sides of the story: David Duke, David Irving, some interesting Unz writers, et al.Of course they cannot say it aloud yet, but can be angry about it.

        Maybe someone’s already mentioned it here, but all these anti-Israelprotests seem to be controlled opposition. It’s no secret that Soros is funding many of these pro-Hamas groups.  There was a NY Post article on it last week, but of course no where in the article was it mentioned that he is Jewish. It seems like the typical playbook of let’s create some opposition so we can control it for our benefit which, as always, is playing the innocent, forever-tortured victim.

            Is that everyone’s default comment; “controlled opposition.” Not everyone or everything can be controlled opposition. I see it all over tossed around like a football. But never any proof presented.At this late stage the Cloud ppl, puppet masters, PTB, have dropped the mask and they needn’t bother with the costs and efforts to maintain controlled opposition.Trump, Musk, Tucker, Alex Jones etc… All controlled opposition.

                They may start out as genuine, but I think there’s a case to be made that when your voice gets a wide enough reach, you are either co-opted or eliminated.
We all saw Musk go to Auschwitz with the yarmulke on his head after he said the badthings. I’m pretty sure that trip, and that fashion choice, were not his idea.

When you’re enemies fight, let them and hope that they destroy each other.
To take it back to sportsball analogies, I hope the Pally’s win the mid-east semi’s…
Not because I like them, but because we’ve played the Blue Stars in the finals many times and always lose; it’d be nice to have a different opponent with strengths/weaknesses that I feel like we could win against more easily.

        My short criticism of Z Man is he does not take seriously how bad things are. Tribe up means tribal alliances. Between the two religions that don’t eat bacon, I know which I am more compatible with and which I can live with more. Which one I have a longer history with, and which one has the most incompatible goals versus myself.
I don’t disagree with his findings, I just find them irrelevant given the situation.

        Heh!  “Burn Baby Burn” was the slogan of the memorably turbulent election year of 1968; black riots, political assassinations, Vietnam protests, the violent Democrat national convention in Chicago, and President Nixon’s first election.  “Tricky Dick” was as popular as President Trump, for the same reasons, and probably our last pro-American president.

            If the demographics were still the same Trump would beat Biden like Nixon beat McGovern. Funny how neither of those guys as president managed to do a whole lot for white America. Probably their greatest accomplishment, both of them, was the level of zeal they inspired in their opposition.

        Final exams (which haven’t yet been abolished but one day will be) are in a week or two, and then everybody will go home for the summer and we will get a new Current Thing.For the “left” there is a presumption that protest is a consequence free activity, which has held true while they have been demonstrating in favor of regime objectives for the last half century at least. The question in front of us is whether or not the regime imposes punishment that sticks for those who are being arrested/expelled etc. In which case there would be some Noticing. But it doesn’t have to happen that way, time will tell.The astroturfing of these demonstrations by Soros Inc, and the staunchly pro Israel stance of the GOP, give further fuel to the idea that a deal has been struck to put the Orange Man back in the White House in return for his support of Our Greatest Ally, and no doubt in return for other things too. At least, I can’t come up with another reason why leftist dark money would back these schismatic anti regime protests in an election year.

            Leftists, and even a great many Leftist Finkels, have long preferred the various Muzz to the Israelis for the simple reason that they view Finkels as white, and anti-white racism is the quiddity of their ideology. Note that all this BDS stuff is an academic phenomenon and academia has been a Leftist precinct since at least the late 70s. For the Leftists, the conflict between the Israelis and Muzz is similar to the one between white and negroid South Africans, and we know who they supported back then.

                Muzzie theology is much closer to Zionocratic theology than is Christianity, esp. the Trinitarian variety. The Koran is perceived as another mistaken book, but the “New” Testament is an idolatrous abomination. Other factors include Muzz fatalism and a habit among European philosophers and scientists of challenging and attacking the foundations of Zionocracy. The Muzz are too slavish, too superstitious, and too servile to lay the necessary groundwork as did European Christians centuries ago. You could say that the Muzz have too little λογος in them and their cult.

                It’s plausible that while Soros Sr. is mostly napping in between baby’s blood injections, Soros Jr is dumb enough to do as you say. But your typical baizuo has an instinct that is stronger than his preference for darkies, and it’s called TDS. The TDS compels him to tell any lie or obscure any truth that might paint the Orange Man’s opponent in a negative light. This TDS is operative from the media on down, at the Congressional Budget Office, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Census Bureau, and everywhere else. It most certainly would or should prevent any election year schism among the faithful, as the TDS afflicted instinctively know what does or doesn’t help the Orange cause. Thus my assessment that this whole thing is engineered/astroturfed for other purposes.
