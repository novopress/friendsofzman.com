        Great post and scary as hell. Not mentioned is that in a post (real) work world in which a tiny minority of people are employed in truly necessary professions is that the best chance a non-STEM, non-finance person has at attaining a middle class life is through a teaching or government job. Corporate America and the right have destroyed labor (and they are also huge proponents of immigration) and turned careers into jobs into gigs. I don’t understand the macro people who think debt isn’t a problem. If interest rates rise then the cost of servicing the debt will rise and those costs are already sky high.Ultimately, the issue is that the economy needs very few workers these days but we somehow have to give everyone an income. That’s why Cowen’s beantopia prediction sounds like the future.
