        A friend told me about his neighbor. The neighbor pays Indinesians to make banner ads. The neighbor makes 300k distributing the ads. The neighbor basically goes to meetings all day and then outsources the actual work to the Indonesians. How many people click on these ads to justify so many people getting rich?

        Nonsense jobs is a pet issue of mine. When you automate the jobs most important for survival – agriculture, extraction, mining, manufacturing – you force people to look for jobs elsewhere. For much of the past several decades the elsewhere has been healthcare, government and education. But the private sector isn’t immune to nonsense jobs. High frequency traders, marketers, social media experts and the thousands of people who make shitty apps and Internet advertisements. I know a guy who makes mid six figures driving traffic to a website. He pays Polish programmers to make shitty games and he runs sweepstakes. Who spends their time playing the shitty games and watching the ads (in return for entries into the sweepstakes)? Unemployed dummies in middle Anerica. Not to be offensive but how many people are getting rich pushing crap through digital media?

Twitter, Facebook and Whatsapp created some billionaires from crap. Some smart guys supposedly said, “We Can’t Get Rich Doing Each Other’s Laundry.” That’s not stopping us from trying.
