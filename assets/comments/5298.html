        “Why hardly anyone dies from a drug overdose in Portugal,” Washington Post, 6/5/2015, and many other such reports, but I guess Portugal is “demographically exceptional” to those who want to maintain drug criminality for the “bad” drugs.Some years ago a Canadian study also said decriminalizing heroin reduced OD deaths (don’t recall, may have been about Portugal), and a couple of news reports of OD deaths the result of friends dumping an OD’ing buddy for fear of being charged with drug crimes.Then we have the stories of large numbers of Vietnam Vets returning after heavy &amp; very pure heroin usage only to kick the habit on their own.Kinda sounds like the Libertarians, Milton Friedman, U MI Econ Prof MJ Perry and many other non-libertarians are right about decriminalizing all drugs.

            I find suspect all these stats on ODs and related alcohol/drug fatalities.I looked with some detail at one of the Canadian heroin OD studies and it was grossly manipulated. Things like studying ODs at the “approved injection site” while ignoring the increased ODs outside of that facility. Alcohol “related” accidents typically include passengers or crash victims that also had imbibed alcohol and the driver or drivers may not have had alcohol.But you must trust science or you are a denier.

        I just don’t know. Dealing with addiction is a never-ending story. There’s no easy answer and anyone who has actually dealt with an addict understands that the addiction continues until the addict hits bottom or some such, and decides they want a different kind of life. Libertarians want to hew to an Ideal Person Living in Ultimate Liberty, but to a lot of people, liberty simply means using as much drugs as possible. What do you do with a person like that? The social costs are great. Prohibition doesn’t work. Legalization brings a myriad of problems. Long story, short: no easy answers. Maybe never an answer at all.

        Actually, legalizing marihuana edibles is a mistake. It takes about a half hour before you come onto it. Because it’s food, people tend to eat more, because they don’t think it’s having an effect. That doesn’t happen when it’s smoked.And I am skeptical about those stats. WA state had a terrible rollout. They had the Liquor Control Board handle it. Voters had just gotten rid of the Liquor aboard and allowed alcohol to be sold in regular stores. Perfect folks to handle legalization, right? Some counties still don’t allow pot to be sold. It could take years to sort it out.

        The very idea that heroin users are jonesing to get off the drug is just ridiculous. Both science and addicts themselves have told me that heroin is is far less challenging to withdraw from than speed in any form. They use it because they love it. Charlie Parker gave up his lifelong habit when he lost his reliable dealer. In other words, he didn’t want to OD. He OD’d five years later on alcohol.Many people can maintain for a lifetime on heroin, as Winston Churchill or Paul Newman did on alcohol, but no one can maintain on speed.And if 1906 never happened, maybe the gene pool would have been shaped differently, and for the better.

        Public apology for the multiple posts. Seems there’s a tick in the system I don’t understand. Emailed Z-man about it. Hopefully, it won’t happen again.

        The few I’ve known who were involved with drugs were bored. Empty.   Had no inner life.  No there there.  They needed external stimulation like television.  Mostly they just seemed to want to get out of their so-called lives.  To escape into another place.  Or just to numbness.
No law enforcement agency can fix that.

        You may have heard that Washington State also legalized recreational marijuana, although Colorada gets the most publicity. The statistics were recently released: marijuana-related auto crash fatalities are up 50% since legalization, well-above alcohol-related. Reality bites.
