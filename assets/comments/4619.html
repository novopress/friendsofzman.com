        “people close to her say she has not yet grappled with the kind of big-donor courting”The problem with Hil is, deep down, she believes she is owed all this as tribute. It’s why she has no problem grinding people down after she’s through using them, because, after all, if she can’t use them, they’re useless, right?

        This country is not quite Argentina yet. Clinton’s inevitability is possible to think of when she hasn’t done any interviews or speeches yet, but she is a mean, nasty old lady of dubious sexual orientation without a shred of charm or likability. She and Bill are getting old, and they are used to shaking people down pretty aggressively. Billionaire donors know what the deal is but they have huge egos and need too see a little ass-kissing before they pay up. She just can’t do that.The disgust reaction of the American people is well attenuated, but putting this evil hag up as our new Dear Leader still isn’t going to sit well with them. People could fool themselves about Obama, at least he appeared smart and normal, but Hilary is just a freak. Americans understand and accept freaks in their roles in the legal and educational establishments- HRC could be a man-hating family court judge, or a man-hating social science professor- even congressman from a progressive district- but executive office is supposed to be held by presentable people, and she is not presentable.Why the hell did Bill marry her anyway? I suspect he saw a talent for behind the scenes ruthlessness and total loyalty that covered his weak spots. But Lady MacBeth doesn’t get to be the king after MacBeth retires.

            P.S. Z-man, what the hell is a “hoffkaktor”? IF you meant to use some German word there, I’m telling you, that ain’t it.
Typo. Fixed now. The word is hoffaktor.
