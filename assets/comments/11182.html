        McCain traded on his own illness to take revenge on Trump. You can’t get much lower than that.

            Google will now be busy fighting itself instead of getting on with things. Couldn’t happen to a better bunch ;).
Sort of like what Russia did to us in the last election (not working to get Trump elected, but working to stir the pot and create chaos.  Russian mission accomplished!).

        As to why Goolagle made the worst of all possible choices….like progs everywhere in the age of Obama they thought the long fight was won, so why pretend to bend? Owning Google, Facebook, and UTube is a more powerful toolkit still than owning  MSM, Academia, and the Deep State. It’s tiresome defending elaborate indefensible positions; they were home free, and this. You see the white flag right ahead and you just want to be declared the winner and coast. This offends them. It’s personal.

        Another great show Z-Man. Keep up the good work. All good. The last segment about a man’s responsibility to women hit home for me as I recently ended a relationship with a great lady who didn’t understand the importance of making and raising babies. We’d have made great babies.

        I loved the podcast, but your continued insistence upon calling top tier MMA “bum fighting” is ridiculous. Kimbo Slice was not a real MMA athlete and nobody saw him as such. He was a bum that Bellator grabbed to boost ratings because of his Youtube brawls, which had gone viral, and shame on Bellator for stooping that low. They were called out on it by fans and fighters alike.The UFC has a real story behind it, created to showcase Gracie Jiu Jitsu as an effective fighting style, and it succeeded wildly.I mentioned this the last time you brought up MMA, but having trained and wrestled with active MMA competitors, as I have, gives one an understanding into the level of athleticism and commitment involved, and to call them bums or equate it to bums brawling is displaying a willful ignorance. Even a mid tier MMA fighter could crush a top ranked pro boxer very quickly in a real fight, and Mayweather has admitted as much. McGregor goes into this fight knowing that he could destroy Mayweather in a real brawl, and that’s a real psychological advantage. Coming from a wrestling or Jiu Jitsu background, as I do, probably helps one understand MMA and the strategies involved better than a boxing fan, although I love boxing as well and watched it  a lot in the 80’s. I love watching Lomachenko and Golovkin now.As long as McGregor stays standing for 12 rounds without getting his jaw broken, he’ll come out looking great. And then go he wants to go to Russia and whup Khabib Nurmagomedov’s ass, which I’m looking forward to.If you don’t like MMA, that’s fine, but trying to justify your dislike by talking it down in contravention to the facts is a bit goofy. Just say you don’t like it.MMA athletes are not bums by any stretch of the imagination.

            I agree that McGregor just needs to finish the fight and not look silly doing it. That last part is important. Exactly no one thinks Mayweather has the punching power to take out McGregor at this stage of his career, so just staying upright is not enough. Tex Cobb stayed upright against Holmes, but that fight is notorious for its lopsidedness. This is what Mayweather did to Gatti, who was actually a good fighter.

                Gatti was a great fighter, and got crushed by Mayweather, but some argue Gatti was already in the twilight of his career and displaying obvious signs of being punchdrunk during interviews.Mayweather was in his prime during his fight with Gatti and it showed.I refer people to Gatti’s first fight with Mickey Ward if you want to see some old school slugging. The guinea versus the mick.Ethnic warfare at it’s finest.

                    Mayweather destroyed some great fighters in their prime. He is 40 now and he has lost a step, but McGregor has never fought anyone in the top-100. It’s really not fair to expect him to be anything but outclassed. If he manages to avoid being embarrassed, it is a great triumph.

        This is the first one I’ve started listening to. I only got through the first two parts before my wife asked me to turn it off when I picked her and the kid up after work to run a few errands, and I’m putting it back on in a few minutes when she takes the kid to bed. So far, this seems pretty good and I already anticipate wanting to tune in next week.

            I’m getting more comfortable with the mechanics of it. It’s a bit weird talking to yourself, but you do get used to it. I’m still noodling over the format a bit, but I think I’m going to stick with the one hour length and then do subsidiary videos on select items as time permits. I’ve been fooling around with a software package that lets create graphs and charts in a video format. You can splice in all sorts of graphics and make it look professional without being a professional. I think there is an undeserved niche there.
