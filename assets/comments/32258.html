        As we’re “sinking under the weight of demographic reality” the White man’s candidate, Trump, is pushing a plan to staple green cards to diplomas of foreign college graduates. Republicans really do refuse to see color, and are unwilling to grasp the reality of identity politics. Sam Francis got it right over 30 years ago by calling them The Stupid Party.

            The future of conservatism is nationalism, civic or otherwise. Not the “line go up” “shakes fists at lefty” conservatism that we know now.In Western Europe, conservatives will mean conservative Muslims in cities and native whites in the hinterlands (i.e. ethno-nationalist). Imagine a continent-wide Turkey (excuuuuse me,Turkiye) but with more urban blacks and the Kurds are all white.In North America, conservatives will be anti-liberals of all colors (i.e. civic nationalist). Imagine Brazil but with more A10 eye colors, and mestizos doing roman salutes.Anyone who comes out of the woodwork talking about tax breaks for the middle class and our brave men and women in uniform will be shot.

                Marko:  Civic nationalism is an oxymoron, an artificial creation imagined into existence by people like Israel Zangwill and his pretend melting pot.  It’s either blood and soil nationalism for White Europeans or the mongrelized mixtures and caste of Brazil.  You seem strangely fixated on this fever dream of a multiracial ‘conservatism.’

                    Exactly.  CivNat is a “cope” for people (Whites) who see their country dying through miscegenation and simply can’t accept such.

                    I wasn’t promoting or giving a value judgment to civic nationalism; just predicting that civnats will be the default form of conservatism here in North America, as opposed to Europe, which will be more overtly ethno-nationalist.And one certainly can be civic nationalist…there are lots of multi-ethnic countries round the world that are more or less united around a flag or religion, or a language. Even countries that are mono-ethnic have serious divisions if not civil wars. If everyone’s the same, then “the narcissism of the small difference” will kick in, and a couple generations later you might have a Rome vs. Veii situation. People just don’t get along and that’s why we have religion.In a multiracial country such as ours, our best hope is a civnat who owns and defeats the Left. There really is no alternative, and I don’t care if my country is run by Groypers as long as they don’t force me to become Catholic.

                        More or less united with the emphasis on less.
Racially and ethnically homogenous societies are far more likely to but united, civil and unriven by sectarian strife than are diverse ones. Nothing could be more obvious. Therefore, the objective of whites in AINO should be to do what we can to weaken the Power Structure, coalesce geographically, and when the time comes, secede and form our own sovereign states. Participation in Civ-Nat projects only distracts us from the ultimate goal.

                            Unfortunately, AINO has one of the biggest and most powerful central government to ever exist. It has 2.87 million employees spread across hundreds of departments micromanaging nearly ever aspect of life, at least in an economic sense.  Add probably over a million more in state, county and city employees.  There are over a million armed police from dozens if not many scores of agencies.  It collects enough data about all of us to reconstuct our lives should we ever become a target of the agencies collecting the data.This count does not include private and semiprivate people who work for government on a contract basis.   Cold case murders and rapes are being solved around the country by working with the private and academic sectors to build family trees from DNA evidence left at the scene along with private DNA companies and academic genealogist.  Or how about this wonderful tool called geofencing.There are cameras everywhere and most of them work and the data is held for long periods of time.  Cops have gone to Walmart or Home Depot a year after a murder when they identify a suspect and they can pull the camera data from around the time of the murder and show them purchasing duct tape, trash-bags, bleach and other stuff to help facilitate the murder or cleanup, even if they paid in cash.All this stuff can be turned against dissidents and certainly partisans.  Right now it is largely to catch bad guys. But that will likely (or at least possibly) change.

            Trump is seriously oblivious to current reality and still seems to live in the 1980s….That’s why he’s such a good politician..his confidence is infinite because he doesn’t notice anything….

            Wolf:  It’s notrepukes so much as it is White people in general.  Boomers and Silents pretend they don’t see race because ‘we’re all the human race’ and they’d like to buy the world a Coke.  The under 50s have been schooled and policed and marinated in non-rayciss/anti-White thought of varying degrees.  Even in those few majority White school districtsremaining, they always vote for the black/mestizo/Asian girl to be Homecoming Queen, because they’ve totally internalized the media’s aggressively non-White standards of beauty.  Zman identifies 20% of Whites as spiteful mutants; add another 50% as determinedly color-blind.  I don’t care who  counts the votes or what ‘rules’ are supposedly in play; demographics determine the future, NOT electoral politics.

                3g4me, there is one and only important decision for you to make over the course of the remainder of your life:In the aftermath of the WWIII nukular exchanges, when the goblins come to steal your long-since-pre-prepped food supply, are you ready &amp; willing to send all of the goblins to their graves?And did you remember to stockpile sufficient @mmμnition necessary for sending each and every goblin to its grave?Did you over-purchase on your@mmμnition to the tune of five or ten times what you will ackshually end up needing?Since the dawn of gunpowder, no soldier ever said, “Dadgum, Sarge, we brought too much @mm0 with us!!!”PRO-TIP: You’re also gonna need quality drones to give you aerial reconnaissance on the movements of the goblins, and night vision will likely be indispensable.

            Dunno about now but I actually read Trump’s DACA proposal from a few years back. It was astonishingly strict. If the prospective greencarder had so much as an unpaid parking ticket, no amnesty and deported forthwith.Of course, getting the courts to follow such a rule so strictly is its own problem, but (much as we’d like to see it) politically you can’t get away with zeroing out immigration, so I think Trump was doing the best he could with what he had, and counting on the fact that the Dems would think he’d given in when in fact his proposal set very strict terms and would have ejected all but the most upstanding.

        I predict Trump loses — possibly even fairly and squarely. In the off chance that Trump wins, such an outcome will demonstrate beyond doubt that he is no serious threat to the establishment. Then again, the four years he already spent as prez surely proved that. The fact that he is still alive all but guarantees that he is wholly innocuous to those who actually call the shots. Trump is no more than a middle finger that his fan club enjoys wielding around. He provides nothing more than the satisfaction of ineffectual revenge.

                    Democrat party was once the party of the old South and white southerners remained democrats well past the time that it was noticed that democrat politicians had changed sides.  The southern electorate were ‘yellow dog democrats.’  If the circumstances were changed, I’d vote for a yellow dog over an Obama (for instance).  Well the spiteful mutants remain in the yellow dog camp.

                Abdelaziz Bouteflika was the president of Algeria from 1999 until 2019. In 2013 he suffered a stroke.  He was, nevertheless, re-elected in 2014.  His public appearances became increasingly rare and he was repeatedly hospitalized for complications from the stroke and other ailments.  In 2019 he announced that he planned to run for a fifth term as president, but the announcement provoked such widespread protest that he resigned later that year.  He died in 2021 at the age of 84.

                    Interesting; so even “brownunist” countries are prone to that kind of thing.I get communist countries which turn into glorified monarchies but in situations like Algeria, and Biden, it seems like the people actually running the show could rig the game to keep running the show.  I mean, especially in the U.S. it’s not like the elections aren’t scheduled at regular intervals.

                    I was actually in-country for most of Abdelaziz’ final term.
It was an open secret that a cadre of generals and the intelligence services were running the country.
Other than that, I had a beautiful apartment where many a good time was had.

            Regardless of who wins the only significant difference between them would likely be Trump being more pro-Zionist.
Happenings could come from unrest as areactionto either’s election, but I think that’s rather unlikely too due to Leftists running the majority of society (so why wreck what you already control) and Conservatives being utterly feckless.

        “The point is the die is cast and there is no salvation at the ballot box.”Yep. It is literally impossible for Trump to “make America great again.” America cannot be great if it is nonwhite.The demographic death of the white race is probably irreversible, certainly in the short term. The institutional weight of the entire U.S. government has been profoundly anti-natalist for at least sixty years. The government actively promotes and encourages birth control and abortion for white women, and actively promotes and encourages anal sex between men. The Jewish Secretary of State Blinken literally stated the other day that the goal of the U.S. was to “promote” LBGTQ worldwide.At the same time, the entire institutional weight of the U.S. government is dedicated to allowing hordes of Third World nonwhites to emigrate to the U.S., both legally and illegally, and to give nonwhites preferential treatment in hiring and contracts.It is a profoundly untenable situation.In order for trump to succeed at “making America great again,” he’d have to be the “Hitler” the Left is accusing him of being, and he’s not.He’d have to quite giving money to Ukraine and Israel and NATO and give it to American whites instead, pay white women to make babies instead of becoming corporate slaves, round up all 30 million illegals and put them in camps before deportation, put an end to affirmative action, arrest the queers, and arrest anyone who tried to stop him.None of that has a snowball’s chance in Hell of ever happening.

        Three facts prove the American you grew up in is over; (1) That Biden ever won in 2020. (2) That 3-letter Federal agencies were so easily weaponized against Trump. (3) That J6 citizens were arrested and prosecuted without any regard to their Constitutional rights.The German political party of the 1930’s and 1940’s has nothing on the current American Democratic party and the liberal media propaganda machine behind it all. TheAmerican political system today would make even Goebbels blush.America is not heading towards a fall like Rome. On the contrary. It’s gaining momentum towards a new Progressive 4th Reich.https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/ministry-of-propaganda-and-public-enlightenment

            Version IV is impossible because the multi-racial chaos precludes stability, which is gone forever. Far more likely here is a fusion of the Italy of many decades back with a Latin American junta–government dysfunctional and falling and reformulating on a regular basis, and tanks on the streets whenever the various tribes are going at it too badly to allow the caudillos to focus on graft.My hope is Europeans see the chaotic upheaval and the GAE has receded enough to allow them to distance themselves, gain independence, and begin to take necessary steps to avoid the same fate. There likely will be many white, semi-autonomous enclaves in the States and Canada but they will be largely powerless and have no control over the rest of the countries.

                    To bottom line it, stability could be achieved only if Juan and Co. liquidated the entire black population. The geriatric white Karens still have grip on power and will not allow for it. I think it’s politically impossible, although there is a final solution so to speak available. The not pretty path isn’t open yet and I don’t see a day on the horizon that it is. The scenario Karl laid out would be available, ironically enough, only in a country with a super white majority. The white semi-Leninists are vastly outnumbered now and hated just as much as the Dirts.

                Worse, it was backed by pure sheep-like obedience to authority, like a giant Milgram experiment.There were times in the past when whites would have told anybody exercising that kind of power to go fuck off — the Stamp Act Riots, the Boston Tea Party, the Irish Draft Riots.No more. Every Karen out there willingly volunteered to rat out violations of the covid edicts as if she were a Stasi agent.And it was authority that defied logic and science. If YOUR mask and YOUR so-called “vaccine” actually protected YOU from death, why should you care what I do? if I get covid from failing to wear a mask and die (LOL), that’s my problem, not yours.But If I refuse the vaxx and refuse the mask and remain perfectly healthy, while  you scrupulously comply and become ill… it undermines your faith in authority, which cannot be tolerated.

                    People are supposed to live under authority. Any functional society has experts and leaders who need to be generally trusted and obeyed. The tyranny of Covid Captivity is ironically what happens when the rebellion is eternal. When the directions do come, they will be intrusive and almost absolute.

                All I know is that given Covid Captivity, the state has the ability to crack down on any number of degenerate behaviors. It just doesn’t want to. Kids struggle with p0rn, drugs, etc and it happens because our overlords could care less about it.

            The fact that the FBI demanded all the security cameras be switched off during the Mar-a-lago raid tells you everything you need to know about our federal “law enforcement” agencies.
That should be an instant case dismissal by the judge right there, and the fact that they released fake incriminating photos to the press should put agents in prison.
It’s barely news though. Republicans refusing to hold hearings on this alone means they know which way the wind is blowing.

                The Treaty of Tordesillas remains, for me, a monument to European panache. “This half of the world is ours; the other half is yours.” The Pope was down with it, and who else mattered? They made it stick too, at least until other European powers decided to get in on the action.

        What we’re seeing with the post-debate hysteria is the long-deferred Dem Party power struggle coming into the open. Biden was always a compromise candidate among the various factions. Now he’s a compromise cadaver. This has emboldened the other factions. So the game theory is: Fight now or agree to rally behind the corpse and settle the struggle later. Fighting now has an unpredictable outcome. Either strategy may allow Trump to evade Zman’s dire electoral math (outlined above) by discouraging minority turnout and necessitating another fraud, or outright outraging normies and making fraud implausible or impossible.

            Exactly. I suspect this is the reason Biden has yet to be sacked. Shanikas gwannabe pissed if Kamala doesn’t becomes dey queen (wait till they find out she’s married to a Jew), but the white fossils still want to cling to power and throw gibs at the coloreds of people. In addition to elections becoming nearly insurmountable for whites, the spoils fights among Dey Diverseatsea will make them impossible. The only voting that matters is with your feet, and while that’s an unsatisfactory solution, you take what you can get.

                Jack:  As you note, the ‘white’ fossils are clinging to power – both because they never relinquish it voluntarily, and because the majority of up-and-comers hot on their heels are POX.  Forget Gavin Newsome – the blacks and mestizos feel they’ve waited long enough and now it’s their time.  And that’s why the Jewish money-men are getting so nervous.  They’re just nowrealizing that their $ and power cannot insulate them they way they thought – because quantity has a quality all its own.  Whites in AINO are down to about 53% (and they are OLD), and Whites in the world are down under 10%.  Those are the only numbers that matter.

Whites have a pathological altruism gene, Jews a suicidal hatred one.As an aside, I would not be surprised to learn we already are a minority. It’s not likely but quite possible that has happened even o.Also, an unintentionally candid explanation of the first paragraph:The Fate of the Gentiles – Tablet MagazineNo one is a bigger captive than the white Christian Zionist sending his cards and letters to people who want him dead and his children raped, enslaved and killed.

                    Late to see this, but to add to what 3g and Ostei wrote, be certain to visit a place even with great demographics before considering it. All-white enclaves are magnets for cosmos and SJW’s…for reasons. Also, even though some geographically large counties seem to have bad demographics when you drill down there are expanses that are great; the question with them is how much political punch they pack in towns distant from the little to middling city where the problem is congregated. Harsh geography and weather are your friends, too, as is distance from military installations and the like. Likewise, economic distress, as long as it doesn’t draw problems with cheaper housing, tends to retain core white populations, case in point, Appalachia and so forth.There continue to be quite a few white havens, but, again, do not assume on the basis of demographics alone to go somewhere. The doors opened by traitors in our in-group caused the problem in the first place.

            Sailer (I know, I know) had a good point with his “Coalition of the Fringes”: They need to be pointed at an external enemy to stop from tearing each other apart.(See the Pali-bros and a Certain Tribe, Vibrants! and Diversity)So now, one set of folks in the cities is PO’d a bunch of fence jumpers are getting “their stuff”, while another set of people is meeting the consequences of importing people that hate them into the US.Having a shambling husk as their “leader” who can’t pull them all together to focus on Orange Man Bad means the knives are out.

        Steve Sailer thought the right could win with a coalition of 60 percent whites, 40 percent Hispanic, and 20 percent black. I simply don’t see a way to get these numbers. He could get more Hispanic votes by being explicitly anti-black and hitting the law and order caudillo rhetoric hard, but the current leadership will die before doing that.

            Sailer also argued that for the GOP to increase its share of the Hispanic and possibly Asian vote was to make the Dems the black party and make the GOP the not black party, not the white party.  If Asians are still voting Dems after 4 years of Shitavious beating up grandma, they deserve it.

                Subcons may despise blacks, but they hate andresent Whites (and in many cases want to marry them, both to lighten their color and demonstrate their demographic and cultural ascendancy).  Same with mestizos.  This desire to look whiter does NOT equal valuing Western Civilization.  The Asians have always considered themselves the sole civilized race, and their numbers and economic power mean they no longer have to pretend to be the model minority.  The jungle Asians are a mixture of both – intermarrying to lighten their skin and having the numbers and cultural confidence to claim to be the best combination of White and Asian.  Like Sailer’s commentariat.

Not sure about jungle Asians—as in who you are speaking of, but South Asians, as in Indians, yep.  I comment here because David Reich’s book, “Who we are and how we got here…” has an interesting chapter on Indian origins and populations and their Caste system.  In the chapter on India, Reich is very impolitic and actually sketches some images of the representative castes.  Basically, the darker your skin color, the lower the caste you assume—or are assumed to be of.  Who’d have thunk?

            The GOP would get moreblackvotes by being genocidally anti-black. Paleos used to note, I assume truthfully, that Hitler got a higher percentage of the Jewish vote than Reagan did.Republicans have no appeal to any group that values hierarchy over “principle” (philosophy, religion, constitution). White menuniquelydo not. Fairness is our idea of rightness. It’s not anybody else’s, not even white women’s (nor womanly-minded white men’s).The instant shift of the Asian-American vote to a negro-tier preference Democrats the moment Republicans began their campaign against “anti-Asian discrimination” (anti-whiteness that incidentally injures Asians) is perfect evidence. The smartest people on earth vote to ruin their own children’s lives—if it also hurts some already-loser they hate.If Republicans wanted to win (they don’t), they’d become not the white party but thefuck you we’re the white party. Trump accidentally hinted toward that—and was relentlessly falsely accused of “worse”—and he got more minority votes than any other Republican.No shit.

            “…win with a coalition of 60 percent whites, 40 percent Hispanic, and 20 percent black.”Here’s precisely where a CivNat like Sailor (or VDH) fails to acknowledge reality.  Sailor’s CivNat tendencies can only arise in contradiction to his purported solid understanding of HBD science.  His coalition of races can be alternatively understood as a coalition of middle class people who are basically producers with something to lose in this new multi-racial society.  In other words, tax producers, vs tax eaters.The percentages stated above are in contradiction to what HBD science would predict for percentages of tax producers in a first world technological society as broken down by the three major racial categories.  The result will (continue to) be that the party that panders to the tax eaters will prevail in future elections.  All we are witnessing at this point in our demise as a nation is the inflection point predicted by the above, and not some major potentialRenaissance by which we may be “saved”.

Steve is doing that classic sales trick where they plant the assumed goal of making a purchase, and then get you tied up thinking about how good of a payment scheme they can get you.Doesn’t matter if it’s a booby prize.

        The figures you display are shocking. Probably many of the non-whites didn’t bother watching the presidential “debate”, and even if they did, didn’t comprehend the cognitive lack in Biden that was on clear display. Or maybe they don’t care as long as freebies are on offer from the Dems. Some kind of democracy can only be maintained in the US if the overwhelming majority of the population is white.

        Wise Latina has already reached the average life span for a woman with type 1 diabetes. I’m sure she receives good medical care.Speaking of mud women, it appears not many (in the media) who are pushing for Joe to withdraw want to talk about the risk of alienating a certain portion of the left’s base by overlooking/disrespecting Kamala as his replacement. The wogs will never vote Republican, but sometimes they will stay home, forcing somebody to go to the trouble of harvesting their ballot. It was widely trumpeted in the media that negro women won the election for Biden in 2020, but it was unclear (to me) whether or not they actually voted or if that was the result of a harvesting operation. It seems weird for negros to get that excited about another old white dude, but they did love them some Bill Clinton, I witnessed that with my own eyes.

            As one Negro I knew in the Marine Corps expressed about Bill Clinton that explained both his and to a lesser extent Trump’s appeal to Shitavious- “He a pimp.”
Go ahead and see how many times rappers dropped Trump’s name since the 1980s and compare that to how many times Chomo Joe got a shout out and the trend is clear.

                Clinton was a poonslayer. No higher honor can be bestowed upon a man.I should probably not publish this but I was visited by more than 100 women including local dignataries wives and coaches wives who were very beautiful outwardly and some raising children. According to a small hat self-appointed biographer through my early thirties, I am a member of the “Century Club” – I have supposedly physically experienced sexual intercourse with at least 100 women. I did. No dudes or animals or children. Once upon a time I was a ripped wrestler and rugby hooker who trained into the statue of david physique and was called out for this attribute. It’s inarguable I “slayed the poon.” I feel condemned to Hell for this, I appreciate your comment was tongue-in-cheek this point. But I want to raise the point there is sleeze in the dissidents as well.

        I got copied this morning on a reply to an email from my octogenarian stepfather, from one of his similarly aged female friends.With the latest news about Biden and the awful SCOTUS decision, we need all the comfort we can get.  One typical viewer on Thursday night provided my favorite quote:  He said “Hell, No” with emphasis after Trump’s performance and “Oh,no” with a sad voice about Biden. I’ve sent more money to some good Dem candidates all over the country (while saving some for [omitted]), but I almost sobbed Sunday when we sang “America the Beautiful” at church. We have to keep fighting and praying for Biden, who will have and listen to good advisors.  (We can remind Republicans that Ronald Reagan was losing it mentally and still the country survived. I never thought I’d be praising Reagan as a promoter of democracy….)I wouldn’t even begin to know how to talk to a person like this and keep my temper. We don’t just live on different planets, we live in different universes. I won’t bother to pick apart all the things this brief statement gets wrong. You all know. But this is who we’re stuck with on the other side of the White vote.

            Vizzini:  Yes.  People here seem to think they see signs ofracial awakening all over the world, and thus there will be an electoral majority for even a nominally pro-White candidate.  It doesn’t matter if it’s the US or UK or France.  No genuinely pro-White man is going to be the ‘democratically-elected’ leader.  Most Whites 50+ are color-blind civnats at best, and less than 5% of non-Whites will vote against one of their own race. And that’s not even mentioning the money men and that no rules apply when it’s a fight to the death.  There’s just as much cognitive dissonance on the putative dissident right as there is on the left.

It’s as though half the Jews in Wiemar were voting for Hitler into the late 1930s. Probably some of it is just a hold-over of the perception that the law and political establishment favors Whites from the time when it actually did. You would think that at least younger Whites would see what’s really going on today and yet the youth vote is probably the most brain-dead of all.Edited to add: Also, the older Whites in Democrat controlled places like CA have witnessed an incredible decline in quality of life in those same places. Yet, some of them continue voting like it’s 1968 and Reagan is Governor.

                Hilariously, the Gen Zs who whine about this constantly don’t grasp the inevitable progression from;
Boomers are awful! (Boomers start to die off)
Now, boomers AND Gen X are awful!  (Boomers gone, Gen X starts dying off)
Gen Z is …..
The Zman is 100% right when he writes about how pointless intergenerational warfare is.  Every generation has its challenges.

                    Every generation has it’s challenges. Not every generation meets them well. The intergenerational warfare might be pointless, but it’s as real as open borders. Most people are living in a world where their elders are Peter Pans whom they can’t respect. It’s not great, but it is what it is.

                        I understand the complaint.
At the end of the day though, my father is a boomer who’s worked insanely hard, has sacrificed immensely both for his country (drafted) and his children and grand children and deserves ever g-damned thing he’s worked insanely hard for.
Gen Z whining about how “hard it is” goes nowhere with me.

                    Intergenerational warfare is useful to the rulers, which is why they created “generations” as some sort of “reality” starting in the 1970s. It’s also what I call the “Time/Life” effect of pop history; “the” Twenties? Flappers and illegal booze; “the” Thirties? Dorothea Lange’s grim black and white photos, Hoovervilles, etc.; “the” Forties? D-day and women at work in arms factories; “the” Fifties … you can fill the rest in.It is all bullshit, probably initiated in germ form by Edward Bernays, and here we are, “living it”. as if it really exists, this “generational” force.Now that the atomization is nearly complete, you don’t see any effort to divide us by decades, only by this arbitrary gen-x, gen-y, gen-z… it’s all so tiresome, infantile, and pointless.

                One of the issues is that at least Gen Z etc will admit they’re a pack of fa**ots, while Boomers have 0 self awareness. Boomers are much more Dunning-Kruger than my experience with older people.A Boomer that will admit fallibility is rarer than hen’s teeth.
Another point is that the later gens are somewhat a result of Boomers’ behavior, Boomers don’t have that excuse.

                    It wouldn’t be wool in summer, you would switch to linen for the hotter months. It would still be uncomfortable.
If the option was discomfort for a return to civility, culture and the dominant return of Our People… I am willing to wear Kevlar in summer.

                        Wool comes in a weight woven for summer. Older clothes are not that uncomfortable, in part because quite often they were either custom or customized.
Most people sweat more modernly because we are wearing plastics and our sleeves are too short.

        I think Trump is going to win, because the Js are rallying behind him and throwing money at him. Sometimes it really is that simple. Is this a good thing for the country, absolutely not, unless he can keep them at arm’s length, of which I am very doubtful.
I also think Trump could get more of the black vote if instead of talking about black unemployment and the platinum plan he put up campaign posters with his mugshot in black communities. How many of them feel like they’ve been railroaded by prosecutors?

                It remains to be seen. Likely, it does not. That’s the point, though, right? The decline is baked in. I was driving through a city the other day and at a red light, a mestizo kid and his mom tried to sell candy to me and the other drivers. This is third world stuff, and there is basically 100% buy-in that this kid is as much of an American as me. It is over. They will play their little election game, people will vote to signal consent to be ruled by these scumbags, and things will trudge on as they have.

                    sentry:  Perhaps less immediately painful for the 50+ crowd.  I am more concerned with a future for White children.  I don’t see that Trump helps that at all, especially given his desire to give all the non-White ‘college’ students permanent residency and citizenship.

        It truly is a sad state of affairs.  It’s to the point now that the only place where White votes hold any sway is at the local or maybe state level, and even that’s questionable as all politicians regardless of affiliation are in thrall of DIE and will NEVER cater to White interests solely.  After all, we’re all humans and Americans and we all bleed red amirite?  Whites in this former country in particular and pretty much everywhere are screwed.  The future is looking darker and darker – both figuratively and literally…

        Biden may have sent shock waves around the world due to his dismal performance, but I can’t imagine Democrats will abandon him just yet. At least not this close to the election.I can, however, imagine a Democratic ticket where Kamala Harris is pushed aside and replaced withGavin Newsom as VP for Biden’s second term. This makes it easy for Biden to step down gracefully and with dignity allowing Newsom to take control as the new US President. Democrats and the liberal media will cheer both events with equal glee.This avoids any drama or embarrassment to Democrats and the media by not allowing Biden to run. Especially after running cover for him over the past four years. It also avoids having to discuss the on-going economic disaster in California no thanks to Newsom’s woke-progressive policies.As a Presidential candidate, Newsome would have to deal with his track record on the campaign trail and possibly even debate Biden on CNN which will be counter-productive for the Democratic Party. Both East and West coast liberal States will rally behind a Biden/Newsome ticket for no other reason than their shared woke-progressive ideology. Democrats will make Harris Secretary of State just to get her out of the way and avoid insulting the woke-colored-feminist voters.Newsom is well connected to the liberal tech industries which is the base for his legacy in California. Poor Blacks and Hispanic know they will always benefit voting for a Democratic candidate, regardless of how badly a Democratic state or city is being run. These people have no intentions of ever working or being a benefit to society anyway, and Republicans will always represent a White-threat to their lifestyle and social benefits.My money is on a Biden/Newsom ticket.

            Not a chance Biden will push aside a black female VP to replace her with a pale stale male VP. That opportunity evaporated when Newsom replaced Feinstein with a largely unknown black female. The smart play for Newsom at that time was to offer the Senate seat to Harris in exchange for his appointment to VP, making him the heir apparent.The only way to get rid of Harris now is if a seat opens up on the Supreme Court. I can see Sotomayor agreeing to step down if Harris is promised her seat. This would be great fun. Sotomayor is without a doubt the dumbest person ever to sit on the Supreme Court. She does not possess a rudimentary understanding of seventh grade Civics, much less Constitutional law. However, I suspect Harris could give Sotomayor a run for her money in the race for the dumbest Justice in history.

        At the root, this is about bribing gullible voters with free gibs paid for with fake fiat currency. Can that go on forever? Methinks not. When the paper money becomes worthless, the plates stop spinning. Then comes the riots, and you don’t want to be in a big city. Do we muddle-through for the umpteenth time? Perhaps. Do you really want to live in that world? Or would you prefer to just give up and become a techno-tyranny slave? The number of pathogens is relatively few. At least take one with you as you exit.

        Putting the “z” in demoralization while wearing the mask of realism.Not thinking seriously about what can be acheived via the ballot at the state and local level is lazy and defeatist.  Especially given a nominally non-hostile Supreme Court.State laws are driving and accelerating demographic consolidation, thenecessary precondition for re-establishing national sovereignty.How is this not obvious only 24 hours after a post on the failure of second order thinking?California’s law allowing the state to seize children from parents who refuse to go along with genital mutilation is a freak magnet.  Tenneesee’s law authorizing the death penalty for pedophiles will attract even more good people to a state in which a future Governor named Edwards is not unthinkable.The ballot is a weapon, the same as graphs and grenades.If we let math scare us or refuse to walk and chew gum at the same time, what is it that we are doing here?

        Minorities are just the icing. Say Trump TRIPLED the number of blacks who vote R. Big whoop. Black Rs compose a little over 1% of the voters now, so that would add a mere 2 points. Badwhites are 42%*67%=28% of the votes. Just 10% of the badwhites is 3 points.
It’s the G–d– pinkos. The least you can do is help your neighbor understand what Biden did to you, and to your grandkids and your neighbor’s grandkids.

        Off-topic but the East Hampton Star is reporting that a six-year-old girl was raped over the weekend. Coincidentally Biden was in the Hamptons for a fundraising weekend. I’m not saying Biden is the culprit, in fact my guess is that the perp is one of the many illegal immigrant groundskeepers employed by the summer people. Still, can’t help but shake my head at the coincidence.

        YOU ARE WATCHING A MOVIE.
I’m surprised more of you people aren’t on top of this. Sundance gets it (or maybe it was someone else, I don’t remember). Judas Goats have been sent out throughout the system to push the right buttons to make these things happen. (Helped with a little Jeffrey Epstein video, I’m sure.)

                Actually, the SCOTUS has been showing a nasty streak of independence for quite some time. I don’t think it’s fully integrated into the power structure, yet. And the SCOTUS may be the only remaining bulwark against utter collapse and the consolidation of a Leftist hell-state.

        The Zman outed the Kagan clan as the central nerve cluster the neocon Warfare spear.Sundance just outed the the DOJ National Security Division (DOJ-NSD) created by Obama-Holder as the tip of the Lawfare spear.The Chevron decision stripped the Agencies of their arbitrary power…and lawsuits for damages without statutes of limitation are possible.The immunity ruling means the Executive is indeed the top cop and can’t be tied down anymore.What if MAGA populism here, in Europe, in the Commonwealth, represented something old, something new?   If our chains are being severed, link by link, could we have a 50s revival of the fraternal benefit organizations that served locally, Americans helping Americans, before the rise of NGO mercenaries and fake charities?We won’t have our ethno-nations back.  What we could have, is openly recognizing ethnic interests, as was done in the South, of people keeping to their own squares.  Cities and counties of dominant ethnic flavor…many of them, perchance, will be White.Balkanization was the intent all along, that none might be powerful enought to overthrow the rulers.  Perhaps the mad bastards can be satiated, after all, and some of our chains lifted enough to give our few grandchildren a fighting chance in their segregated enclaves.

        Just trying to figure out which outcome would be more fun. Dunno. Guess it depends on one’s appetite for chaos. Personally, my preferences are U-shaped: 2020 levels are very bad, and total no-electricity levels of chaos are also very bad. But there might be a sweet spot in there somewhere in the middle

        After the ‘debate’,https://www.270towin.com/showed Trump in the lead by 3 electoral votes, with all the swing states in his favor.
I’ve never seen this site do that before. Today it’s back to showing them as undecided, but I think it goes to demonstrate the effect backing a zombie is having.

            I’d recommend the 3g4me route.  Separate yourself from the maddening mob and attempt to secure yourself and your family against the rising tide of diversity.  This is not a call to living in the woods and total separation like a hermit, but simply finding a non-diverse community and weaning yourself off a toxic and declining society.
Go Amish!

                Compsci:  I prescribe that sort of separation because most don’t have the stones to actually downsize and live in the woods.  My husband and I are agreed that no one else we know could make it in the cabin-sized house we now happily reside in.  Had to get my oven igniter replaced and the guy who came all the way out to our woods mentioned he bought lots of acreage when he moved here from Arizona 40 years ago at the pittance $173 an acre.  Sold it to marry a local woman and lives somewhere in town, but envied our acreage, privacy, and view.

                        Compsci:  In all honesty, we knew the place was small when we bought it – but did so for the land, location, view, and other amenities such as the Generac.  Plus at that time we had reason to hope to have sufficient funds to build a larger (ca 1800-2000 sq ft) house to our taste.  That has not been the case, but we still have time and hope.  Meanwhile, we have heat and a/c, hot and cold running water, etc.  It’s just a good thing that my husband and I get along so well.

        Trump is a lousy candidate now as he was in 2016 and 2020. Only his odious opponent allowed him to win in 2016 and his only chance now is the odiousness of Biden. Biden’s odiousness was not so apparent in 2020 and Trump’s incompetence in office (and some electoral sleight of hand by the Dems) caused his loss. If the Dems can replace Biden with a non-demented candidate, Trump will likely lose again.

            Demographics is destiny. But it is not necessarily irreversible.  The Spanish reversed theirs in the late 1400s.
But to reverse it, you have to be ruthlessly determined.  So yes, go Spanish Inquisition or go extinct.

        Predictions are fraught with difficulty, of course, but if I were forced to make one, it would be this. I believe Trump will win, and he will win on DR3, thus proving that the establishment Republicans were correct all along, they just needed somebody with more street cred to carry out the strategy.
Now, whether you think this is agoodthing or not is a whole ‘nother discussion, but I think that’s the lay of the land.

            “…Trump will win, and he will win on DR3, …”It’s more complex than that.  Trump is running—whether plainly stated or not—as a populist candidate and represents, at least within the present Republican establishment, a takeover threat to the “same old, same old”.  The “same old same old” Republican philosophy has been to put up the most moderate candidate that can “win” the general election.  This was from the Reagan era strategy.  Hence, the long string of “great Republican hopes” who get elected and then change nothing in Washington, albeit perhaps “slow” the Progressive assault on American values for a brief period of time.A Trump win therefore is not simply a nationwide presidential power turnover, but potentially the destruction of the old GOP.  If Trump wins, and doesn’t turn out the be a complete failure, then the GOP will never be the same.  Hell, it might even turn out to be a real opposition party that folks can gravity to without holding their nose.There I go, spreading hopeless optimism again…

            Well, the old GOP will definitely spin it as DR3 saves the day.  And to be fair, Trump gives them plenty of opportunity to sell it.
