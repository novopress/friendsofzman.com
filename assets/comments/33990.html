            Female bosses are an attempt to have the sterile commands of business replace the warmth and love of motherhood. It is not surprising that the typical girl boss gets exhausted by the time she has one child. Horrified by the thought of breast-feeding, and worried about stomach stretch marks, she wonders if maybe she can get a surrogate to deliver — kind of like the biological version of offshoring your job to a Third World country.

                The existential problem now is that Girl Boss is the new normal for heterosexual living arrangements.I call it the “Lady MacBeth” syndrome.It dwells in Cluster B, and it is hell bent on wearing the pants in the Fambly.In the 1990s, I was a very early casualty of “Lady MacBeth”, and it d@mned near ruined me; thereafter, it took me fully THREE DECADES to reverse-engineer the nature of the phenomenon.The Frankfurt School has so badly poisoned the minds of our young women that, in their relationships with young men, yuge numbers of these women now know nothing but Lady MacBeth, and they have no other tools in their toolboxes via which to hold together a fambly [classical femininity having been long since jettisoned from their toolboxes].Once Lady MacBeth has plunged her psychological talons into an at-risk young man, she quickly invokes a very poisonous psychological castration of the poor fellow, and it ruins him.I’m so worried about Girl-Boss/Lady-MacBeth that I fear our species may be headed in the direction of the Black Widow Spider, where the female weighs well in excess of ONE HUNDRED TIMES MORE than the male Black Widow; in this instance, amongst human beings, we would be looking at female temper tantrums &amp; female psychological viciousness which would on the order of ONE HUNDRED TIMES MORE potent &amp; poisonous than anything a well-mannered young man could hope to bring to the table.

                    It’s why I haven’t married. Had the good sense to bail, but it didn’t stop them from being very vindictive, and your average SIMP man, of course, took the other side. Woe to intelligent men, especially: your dating pool sucks. Good to see the rest of society finally catching up, though, good not to be seen as such a loser, cold comfort as that is.

Ain’t that the truth. Not great looking/frumpy, but intelligent or attractive enough and mid.

                            Educated women are the most poisoned.  Even if unaware, they’ve been taught a man is their problem, and being women, they take the programming.

                                If you’re a bright person, it is extremely difficult for two people to have a good rapport unless you are able to find someone who can keep up with you intellectually.

                        Bro, if your Lady MacBeth is a redhead, then you’re having the ride of your life right now.
It’s gonna be very very difficult to walk away from a Red-Headed Lady MacBeth.
That’s one helluva ride, muh Bro, one helluva ride.
Afterwards, it’ll be impossible for you to ever again date “normal” bishes; in comparison with “Red”, all the normal bishes will seem to be perfectly frigid to ya.
Enjoy that CAT-6 Hurricane whilst the enjoying’s good.

                This is unfair to Napoleon – a brave soldier and hard-working military genius – and somewhat unfair to Mussolini, who served honorably in the trenches in WWI and excelled as a journalist and political organizer. Hogg is more like that Bud Lite tranny.

                    You don’t do Mussolini justice. He was the editor of the main publication of the Italian Socialist Party, then and now a doctrinaire Marxist party. Mussolini was in fact an influential Marxist theoretician, read and liked by people like Lenin. He was expelled from the ISP in 1914, because he supported Italy’s entry into the War on nationalist grounds. During the Great Depression, he got the Italian economy going, and was a hero to non-marxist socialists like George Bernard Shaw.Before WW II, Hitler was another nationalist-socialist who saved Germany’s economy, and was also admired by non-marxist socialists.Of course, they were also totalitarians and warmongers, and eventually committed the great evils that blighted the mid 20th Century, some of which are returning, especially in Europe.

        [Boudica] was a last-gasp effort to resist the Romans. Perhaps that is what we are seeing with the rise of girl boss in the Democratic Party.
I’m not so sure about that analogy. Boudica was a nationalist, or at least a spited female warrior.
AOC’s ever-widening Girl Boss bottom and Liz Warren’s bony Girl Boss fingers and Jasmine Crockett’s fake Girl Boss eyelashes and hair are probably more akin to the witches they tried to burn in Salem.

            One small point: Boudica had skin the game – she’d been whipped, her daughters violated, her rightful kingdom plundered. Procurator Girlboss wanted that on her CV back in Rome sooo bad. And when smoke rose on the horizon and traumatized refugees filled the roads, Girlboss in tax accounting took ship from Londonium for her next career move in Gaul.
She’d depart with that delicious sense of smug contentment that comes from knowing she’d left stupid toxically masculine Gaius Suetonius Pauinus and his ghastly smelly bovine legionaries to scrub the shit out of the carpet.

        It’s amazing how similar Goodlander’s past is to another striver Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen. Just groomed from the start to be stars of the managerial class. As much as Z calls these people stupid, Goodlander and Van Hollen aren’t stupid. Pointless, yes. Soulless, yes. Stupid, no.But as Z notes, these types are utterly useless in the real world; indeed, they bring down any organization that needs to accomplish real work. I’ve worked with a few. They are repulsed by the day-to-day work of getting a project done or discussing the books or sales. Sucking up to the boss or filling their resume, however, lights up their face.Z is right that when these people get in charge, and they often do, it’s over for that organization.

            Spandrell christened these creatures as “sociopathic status maximizers”. Sure enough, they aren’t only female. It’s a type that naturally ascends the ranks of the management of every human network; nowadays, of course, women are tacitly recognized as starting with a heavy handicap, and given heavy advantage over men, which is called “equality of gender”.

                This.  We have two girl bosses at the office.  They’ll go off on people when they perceive an error.  But if you ask “OK, what’s your plan to fix it,” the response is usually something along the lines of “Not my problem.  You go figure it out.”  When employees reach out for help, they’ll duck it, and push it off to others to actually figure things out.

        At the major corporation I where I worked for thirty-five years, sometimes I had girl bosses as far as the eye could see. We called it “The Matriarchy”. Cross one and you’ve crossed them all. In the world of system support, one would pass through occasionally. There was one who was my boss for a while. She had been passed from job to job messing up badly enough that no one wanted to keep her but not enough to fire her. She had no concept of the technical world and thought that those who did were arrogant. Finally, she was moved on without causing too much damage. I had one old-timer boss who said that this kind of person stayed for a while and was promoted on leaving the rest of us to clean up their mess.

            Yep. Same thing in the universities. Completely controlled by grrlbosses. My own academic career was derailed over 20 years ago when I took a job at a community college (hey, I needed money) and discovered it was completely controlled by unqualified and underqualified women who got their positions by being part of the female clique. The vice-president for academic affairs at a college with 30,000 students did not have a doctorate. Neither did my department chair, a micromanaging Karen who concerned herself with such ponderous intellectual affairs as to whether my office lights were on or off or my door was open when I was inside my own fucking office working.The grrlboss phenomenon is a much bigger problem for Western civilization than the racial problem. The racial problem can be and has been dealt with in the past. But the core ideology of the modern West is feminism and gender egalitarianism. It is the official policy of just about every Western government to promote birth control, abortion, female employment, divorce, and to advance women into positions of power simply because they are women. Women have been the primary beneficiaries of the affirmative action and the Sexual Revolution. What else are women who can fuck anyone they want, do not have to have children, and can kill the ones theydobeget without consequence going to do but become soulless strivers?Yet feminists do not, and never wanted to, compete with men on purely equal terms. Feminism is about putting women in power without concomitant responsibility or qualifications. Women everywhere benefit from double standards that favor them over men and entitle them to money and power, yet absolve them of responsibility. They are immune to the consequences of failure, stupidity and incompetence while simultaneously portrayed as “victims.” Universities are the indoctrination camps for this. They currently favor women by a ratio of 60/40. Not for nothing are young men abandoning universities in droves:Why American Men Think It’s Not Worth Going to College Anymore – Bloomberg

                    Sigh. To the folks not in the field—you simply cannot teach computer “science” without such concepts as NoName illustrates, and it’s even more complex than that. I remember having to take a CS course in what was basically linguistics (all Chomsky) so that we could then begin to learn to program/design software to translate languages—big deal in those days of growing American ignorance of foreign languages and the growing need for such translation by the military (NSA?).As far as formal mathematics goes, it was possible in those days for a major in CS to take more units in the Math Dept than in the CSc Dept, such was the rigor of the program. I can see why your female students ran to the dean like scalded dogs.What we began to see with the advent of the personal PC and MS DOS was that folks who could program a few lines in Basic and load/feed a computer system with a few floppy disks to build the current MS Windows OS were advertising themselves as “system engineers” or more modestly “programmers”. That may work in a doctor’s office, but not at the university level.It got so bad, that when reviewing resumes, I immediately tossed those resumes that prominently mentioned MS Windows and MS software. Oddly—it would seem today—I never required formal degrees in CSc as the field was so young that some of the best people developed their skills in disciplines outside a formal CSc program (which did not exist at their universities at that time).P.S.  In another time, and another place, I too remember at the community college level giving all A’s or at least all passes.  It was the height of the Vietnam conflict and the students were all deferred for college.  To fail was to lose one’s student status and to be drafted.  The department head strongly hinted that this was *not* to happen.  😉

                        I’m nearly 50 and I have a BS in computer science.  Coincidentally, I also have a BS in Math – not intentionally, but I had to take so much math that I figured I would double major so I did.  It only required a couple of extra classes over one summer.  If you look at the CS curriculums now, there’s almost no math.  Crazy how it’s changed.

                I taught at a Tier 2 university for some time, both during and after PhD studies. I came into my PhD program with two master’s degrees and previous teaching experience as an adjunct, and didn’t have any money, so I inquired if I could immediately begin teaching upon commencing my doctoral studies.Ironically enough, the assistant chair who was in charge of the hiring was an old-school Aristotelian, who looked dimly upon younger women as instructors. She immediately gave me two classes to teach, which allowed me considerable financial relief after a cross-country move.Sadly, she died of cancer a few years later, and with her, went my sole female defender in a department full of young feminist and blackness and queerness eager beavers. The moment she no longer controlled hiring for each year I immediately lost my position, despite having won a department award for teaching and outstanding student evals for years.What got me when I asked why. The answer: “It’s someone else’s turn now.” The ultimate in female “logic.” So I finished my last semester teaching after hanging around post-dissertation catching my breath, packed my books, put them in storage (12 years untouched now) and live in a hell seemingly crafted by Celine deep in his absinthe, eating ketchup packets in my car and listening to Hegel audiobooks.

                    “I immediately lost my position, despite having won a department award for teaching and outstanding student evals for years.”Student evals are weaponized. They have no independent meaning in and of themselves. If your “colleagues” want to get rid of you and you have shitty teaching evals, they will use that as a pretext. If they like you and you have shitty teaching evals, they will ignore them.Contrariwise, if you have great teaching evals and they want to get rid of you, they will ignore the evals and invent something else.Students mean almost nothing in the university. They are there for only a few years. Your colleagues are there forever, and they are the ones calling the shots.

                Great post.‘The grrlboss phenomenon is a much bigger problem for Western civilization than the racial problem’I know I repeat, but this cannot be emphasized enough.  The gynarchy is priority number one for any group of men in the West serious about the welfare of their nation.  If women keep running the show, it’ll be over pretty quick here.I advise — as always — fighting and not giving up.  Don’t give up your nations and stop elevating your females in all aspects of life.  Stop sending your daughters to college.  Prepare them for marriage to a vetted man instead.Your opportunity is in brotherhood.  The adversary is afraid of brotherhood, especially Christian brotherhood, which is why the Boy Scouts and other male-only organizations are almost non-existent in America.

                “What else are women who can fuck anyone they want, do not have to have children, and can kill the ones theydobeget without consequence going to do but become soulless strivers?”Most of a woman’s life was meant to be spent in the nurturing arts. Absent that, there’s a big space that needs to be filled. Few women are intelligent or creative enough to fill it up the way unmarried men can, with mathematics, music, philosophy, inventions, or other creative obsessions of one sort or another. Empty and amoral careerism is the default setting in our society. I actually think the ones who just try to be the biggest whores are less obnoxious than the girlbosses. They don’t get in the way of men trying to get things done and of course, they can provide some… amusments.

                The vice-president for academic affairs at a college with 30,000 students did not have a doctorate.
They have fixed that kind of issue, now. They are all handed doctorates, as well we degrees with the highest “grades”. Both have become meaningless… but not for these women, who use them to fill the ranks of academia (which no longer is academic, but why would they care? Even conceiving of what real study, knowledge, learning, and university and research is beyond what these people’s mind).

                Women take a job in the same way they do everything in life: for appearances. Everything a woman does is roleplay. She becomes a firefighter not because she wants to save lives but because she wants to be seen saving lives.
John Glubb has done the work of comparing the rise and fall of the major civilisations in history. He identified several phases, from energetic rise to sclerotic fall, and one thing the last phase before they vanished, they all had in common: The empowerment of women.

            I knew a guy who ran a small injection-mould workshop that made capsules for Big Pharma. He was in the market for a chemist, and the best qualified candidate was a woman and was about ready to do the paperwork when he noticed she’d take a $1,000+ pay cut so he asked her about this.
“I just want to work somewhere where there’s no women.”
That freaked him out, so he hired a guy instead.

        “Intelligence officer is the military term for desk jockey”, LOL!  Allowing women into a multitude of positions of authority and influence, along with low IQ blacks and other various tribal swarths has been an unmitigated disaster.  This is not to say there aren’t plenty of White men F-ups, but why massively compound the problem?  As we all know around here, reforming the system at this late stage is impossible – it’s all going to have to be rebuilt from scratch…

            Of course she marries someone with the exact same box checking mindset.  Every aspect of their lives, hobbies, where the vacation, etc., is all done to make the right impression.  You wonder what the relationships are like, do they ever develop any trust with the people in their lives?  I would assume you would get tossed aside the minute being in a relationship with you is no longer beneficial to the other box checker.

                That’s how most of them afford the lifestyle, although in Goodlander’s case she no doubt also has a sizable trust fund.  One is on the outside making money for doing not much while the other is a dedicated public servant.

            I was wondering when you would get to that, the marriage of Goodlander &amp; Sullivan, that is. Look up Alpheus Henry Snow Award on Wikipedia, that’s the prize given to the tippy-top student who made it big with the faculty at Yale their Senior Year. Jake was one of these, and so were a lot of other box-checkers thru the years. Sometimes they are also the Rhodes Scholars, like the guys who surrounded Bill and Hillary early on.

                Bondi’s much worse than Hillary, who’s greedy and vengeful in a way anyone can understand.Girlboss types are the most vicious defenders of the system, maybe because without it they’d beregularprostitutes. Her being on TV every five minutes isn’t shirking her job butbeing seen. It’s a girlboss obsession appropriated from therapy culture, made as literal as possible. She’s learned never to do anythingoff camera.Trump fans who want exposure and punishment of government crimes are extremely angry at her, and increasingly at Trump because of her (and Patel and Bongino and…). They’ve finally read her resumé, now that it’s too late. With the Zimmerman case, Bondi was the decisive “vote”—the final functionary who, merely by properly executing her duty instead of trying tobe seen, could have stopped it—to make BLM an arm of the government.And nobodysaw. Was sheevergiven credit? Not once. Nobody would even give her a job…except Trump. Imagine her rage—at him and his voters, on behalf of those who’ve shunned her.

        Resist the temptation to blame women for this ludicrous, irritating, dysfunctional phenomenon. “Girl boss” could only have emerged in an environment where male strength is lacking.
Those who prioritize the Race Problem over the Sex Problem are putting the cart before the horse. If we don’t get a firm grip on the latter, we have no prayer regarding the former.

                Tom: The Sex Problem is considerably worse because it directly causes our below-replacement fertility rates. Also, it’s an overload of femininity that causes white people to whimper and beg for atonement regarding the Race Problem. Sufficient masculine strength would render such obsequious behavior contemptible.

Bro.
Do you know anything at all about the Family Law Court Syndicates of the USA?
If the j00z in your friendly neighborhood Family Law Court Syndicate set their sights on you, they will destroy you.
And they will laugh all the way to the bank.

                        The Family Law Courts, yes. I agree that those courts are corrupt and parasitic beyond measure. White Gentile men allowed them to become that way. And plenty of white Gentile men (lawyers and judges) directly profited from those courts.

80% == Normies
20% == Weirdos like Us
This divide even tends to be largely NON-correlated with IQ.

                                        I don’t agree. That dialogue wouldn’t have resonated with the audience if there wasn’t a broad awareness of how the system worked. Heck, I was 18 when that movie came out, hadn’t had any personal experience with divorce, but I understood it perfectly well; didn’t consider it the least bit absurd.
There are other pre-Internet pop culture items that speak to this. One that comes to mind is Weird Al Yankovic’s 1988 parody of “Mony Mony”, entitled “Alimony.”

            Feminism is a product of much more than male failings.  Allied with women are the globalist elite, transnational corporations, old money families and so forth.  Girlboss didn’t just arise spontaneously because Men Bad.That said, I cannot agree more that the anglo male of the past fifty years is hopelessly dominated by his wife, daughter, mother, or feminist culture.  It was shameful to witness this so commonly in America.Even the Christian and ‘conservative’ men are hopelessly cucked.  If you want to get along in U.S. society the past half-century, you best be on the side of feminism and endless female empowerment.Likewise, by empowering and entitling their princess daughters and placing them in careers over the sons of the nation, men have betrayed both their nation and God.  There are consequences for perks and special benefits.‘Those who prioritize the Race Problem over the Sex Problem are putting the cart before the horse. If we don’t get a firm grip on the latter, we have no prayer regarding the former’Yup.  As I’ve pointed out here many times.  The anglo nations have been conquered not by blacks or mexicans, but by females empowered by a collusive State and culture.  You are in the shit now, people.

He was there at ground zero, and saw the wrecker’s campaign and its consequences being built from the ground up.

            Exactly. You could ship all the Blacks back to Africa and you’d have definitely improved the country. The problem is that it would take the empowered wammen about 10 nanoseconds to re-import them all in the name of “anti-racism” or just to spite the men. Women are the hub that holds together all the spokes of egalitarian globalism and anti-White/Western ideology.

                I think that may go a long way in explaining why white women seem so eager to betray their race, while no other people’s women do so, despite the horrific treatment they receive.I say it’s not entirely a white fault, but partly due to the millenia long conditioning  exploited by that particular group that has been attached to us since their beginning.Odd how the suffragette movement really got rolling only in one place, America, after 1881, despite our race’s long history of Boudiccas and Queen Elizabeths.The Zman pointed this out in his last paragraph: “it is entirely possible that she is the Boudica of the alien tribe that rules America…Perhaps that is what we are seeing with the rise of girl boss in the Democratic Party.”Who was it that attached themselves to the majority party of the US, who sponsored the empowerment of the Temperance scolds and hellfire ministers with the Prohibition campaign, and who sponsored then the Civil Rights movement and black-over-white (Adam over Eve) marketing campaigns?This was culture war, using ancient and well known exploits, in the language of the bony finger of the Bible pointing at and hectoring us for our Original Sin of whiteness.

        Girl bosses are also a part of European politics: Urusula von der Leyen, Kaja Kallas, Christine Lagarde, even Giorgia Melloni.  I wonder if Alice Weidel, the head of theAlternative fur Deutschlandparty, ever became chancellor, she would also prove to be yet another girl boss.  I was rather hoping that Urusula von der Leyen would become secretary general of NATO.  Give how well she managed theBundeswehrwhen she was German defense minister, after a few years of her on the job, NATO probably could not defeat the Moscow police department.Glad Z mentioned the Snow White Disney debacle.  Rachel Zegler as “Snow White Girl Boss” was evidently as preposterous as it sounded.  Even Disney-friendly critics could not conceal their disdain.

                            Considering the treatment of women in orthodox Judaism and their subsequent exposure to secular and liberal education, this is was not a peculiar development.Pretty much everywhere the neurotic jewesses projected their ethnic traumas on the entire female kind and extended their hatred towards the entire male kind. Assimilation was a mistake.

                Almost all the women who are putative ‘leaders’ on the right fit that mold – lesbians, single moms, mixed-race ‘partners’ and children, all girl bosses who prize their careers.  Across Europe and the Anglosphere, from politician to commentator.  They ought to be home having children or baking cookies with their grandchildren.  Any man who thinks it’s great that his wife wants to run for a seat on the schoolboard or city council or HOA ought to be shot.  Any guy who thinks marrying the president of a sorority or cheer squad ought to run far away.  The signs are all there – ignore them at your peril.

            AfD and a lot of the other “hard-right” European parties all seem to have women spokes-girls. This is understandable since it blunts the obvious leftist attempt to paint the top man as Hitler. The GOP does it here with people like Palin. I find it infuriating that the only way to reintroduce masculine ideas of nationalism, patriarchy, and resistance to (((tribal))) ideology, is to hide them behind a skirt. We will know that these parties are actually serious about their proposals when they have male leadership again.

        Things don’t change. In his great book The Roman Revolution, Ronald Syme describes the aristocratic woman of the Augustan Age, a different creature from the sturdy Roman matron of the past: “Their names were more often heard in public than was expedient for honest women: they became politicians and patrons of the arts. They were formidable and independent, retaining control of their own property in marriage. The emancipation of women had its reaction upon the men, who, instead of a partner from their own class, preferred alliance with a freedwoman, or none at all.”

                I’ve always thought that the real reason “Gladiator,” was trashed by the media and academia is because it is a film that praises masculine virtue, not because it is totally historical and culturally accurate.
One major theme Scott got right was the tension that Roman men, particularly public figures, felt between their duty to their families and their duty to Roman society.
A minor Roman cultural foible the film got right was Maximus’ veneration of the three Roman household deities following the opening battle scene.

        I read the Wikipedia page for both Goodlander and her 2024 opponent, Lily Tang Williams.  The second place candidate in the Republican primary wasVikram Mansharamani, who also ran for Senate in 2022.Williams story is also comical, she goes from fresh off the boat working as a telemarketer to helping manage Walmart’s Chinese operations in something like ten years.  I am left wondering how any person not personally benefitting from the system could still think we are well served by this form of government.

            Never heard of Goodlander before, but those candidates’ names – dear God those names.  Girl Boss and yet another Han/whipped white hookup, and then another in the endless stream of subcons.  Go vote for your ‘fellow citizens,’ comrades.  Politicians make my skin crawl.  I am so weary of klownworld and its denizens.  We are lost in the shadowlands, the twilight of humanity, trapped amongst eternal strangers.

        Zman, would you please discuss (in your show with RamzPaul)the supreme court voting 7-2 to show love to invaders, while ignoring J6 political prisoners? Maybe you can cover the the history of supreme court decisions in general and their political implications? Wasn’t Dredd-Scott also voted by overwhelming 7-2?  Also covering the history of pre-civil war politics would be interesting.

        I would have sworn Jake Sullivan was a poofter. Now I find out this is his wife. She seems about as organic as a Great Value chicken nugget.It’s possible that the permanent regime has already hoisted itself by the Girlboss petard. I have this hypothesis that there isn’t and never really was a Trump “revolution,” at least not among anything resembling a majority, rather, he was just the lucky beneficiary of running against women, whom the voters (as a whole) are reluctant to elect. See what happened the one time he ran against a man?If true, this is a lesson that the regime, and the Democrats in particular, are constitutionally incapable of learning. They can’t even allow themselves to engage in the outrageous wrongthink of asking themselves, even silently, whether or not they should be nominating women. Such is unthinkable. Let alone discussing it out loud, which would be grounds for banishment to El Salvador. So they will quite possibly bash their heads against this “glass ceiling” over and over. I’ve always said that the first woman president would have to be a Republican (not that this is a good thing), but it’s uncertain if even she could get over the top. Clearly Noem wants it.

        Girl Boss is one element of comprehensive program to emasculate the US and render males useless as a warrior component of society. This is being done in order to protect the Elites against an uprising that would likely get bloody very quickly. But DNA cannot be eliminated in a few generations. When things get bad enough and the melee gets going, even the soyboys will be swinging a mace. Visceral, primal rage cannot be overridden by propaganda and indoctrination.

        Another part of this system is that there is always a line of delta males right behind her and totally anonymous doing the real work while she gets the credit. The system collapses immediately after they leave or tune out and are replaced with other girl bosses or spiritual girl bosses (gay men – Pete Buttigieg is a girl boss) that are drawn to the girl boss energy. The deltas instinctively know something is wrong with this arrangement.

            And we are right back where we started. Assuming that’s true, why do we have so few alphas to hire away the deltas and leave those firms swinging in the breeze?
I get it if you trained for a job that no longer exists. It’s hard to build the self-esteem to believe in yourself sufficiently to think you can take an idea and run with it, but if we don’t start getting a few more of those types, men like our fathers and grandfathers, it’s over.

The great untold story of the 21st Century: Who the hell is Peter Thiel, and who are the s0d0mites which have been financing Peter Thiel for the last several decades?
In my mind, I imagine them to be what I call, “John Muir Republicans”.
West coast s0d0mites who are descended from the likes of the Huntingtons &amp; the Hearsts &amp; the Stanfords, and who harbor a great deal of resentment regarding the cultural &amp; financial supremacy of (((the Hook Noses back East))).

        Any time the leadership of an organization becomes feminized, either with real women or witless, effete males, it is headed to destruction.Look at the mainline Protestant churches, such as the Episcopalians and Methodists. They’ve gone from being Gospel-based to being basically, as RamzPaul says, gay bathhouses flying pride flags or better yet, synagogues of Satan.I guess the men who allowed this to happen didn’t read this from 1 Corinthians, Chapter 14, Verses 34-35.34 Let women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted them to speak, but to be subject, as also the law saith. 35 But if they would learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.

All warbling songs written by other faux Christians, chanting how Jesus is their boyfriend, or provided a shoulder to cry on during their latest breakup.  Women always put themselves at the center of the universe

                True.  But there are still some holdout churches scattered around, with male leadership.  Stick to the Scriptures, ignore surrounding culture and don’t get cute.
It’s been quite a shakeout of the church this past half-century. And there’s more to come.  Much of what’s left in the pan now is gold.

                I call that a “happy clappy rock band Jesus” church. That isn’t a church, it’s an emotive performance stripped of the Gospel. The preacher usually talks about Jesus’ love and omits that if you live in sin, you are headed to perdition’s flame.I’m Catholic and I attend a very traditional parish where the pastor is the archdiocese’s exorcist who constantly reminds us that the Evil One is always lurking and knows too well how to push our buttons. He doesn’t tolerate any tomfoolery and his homilies tend to hit you right in the heart.If you go to a good Orthodox or Catholic parish, you won’t encounter that sort of claptrap.

        Let’s hope and pray they are the last gasp of the resistance to the restoration.  A girl boss president would indeed be a disaster.  The best we could hope for would be the US Navy at the bottom of the China Sea.  The more likely outcome would be US, Russian and Chinese nukes flying.

                Fantasies. Men, as must be due to natural laws, are still running everything; from government, to corporations, to industry, to banking.Nothing the élite cares about is going to “fall apart” due to their deviously strategic cunningly imposed apparent “equalities” of gender and race. It goes beyond that: they use the “equalities” they impose to undo what they need to “fall apart” to fulfil their (undisclosed) actual policies.

        I’ve thought about writing an article about the “long-housification” of the workplace. The Project manager is the key example of this. What does a project manager do? She holds meetings and she nags infinitely more productive people, asking them if they’re accomplishing their tasks. The modern workplace is meeting-driven. You’re stuck showing up and getting nagged. “Did you do ‘X’ thing?” I’m currently working on it. Are you my mother? “Well, it’s a deliverable that I have to explain.” Ah, so the nagger has somebody who’s nagging them. It’s trickle-down nagging. All of it is in service of the immediate girl-bosses ability to prove she’s productive (she isn’t) so her girl boss can prove she’s productive. How much of American productivity is wasted in service of these women trying to appear productive? I spend approximately 20% of my week dealing with these harridans. That’s 20% of my time that I could be doing more productive things. Instead I’m locked into meetings with these shrews who have the balls (proverbially speaking) to ask me if I’m “adding value to the company.” It makes me think of 1984 where Winston observes that females were the most diehard enforcers of the “party line.”  If you ask them to get out of your way so you can work, you’re going to get hauled in to HR by other females to get scolded.

        Everyone above me in the food chain, up to EVP, is a girlboss. I told myself I’d never work for one again. So when my company was bought out, I wound up with a girlboss (actually a woman, they are all older and childless which is a factor). Only reason I stayed was she mostly let me be. Now, She moved up and I have another girlboss who needs to make her bones.
I need a job in a more muscular field. Maybe I retire and drive a truck. Put my CDL to use.

        Wow, that was spot on to my experience.  I built a business and sold it to a private equity group as a retirement.  The only catch was I had to stick around a few years and manage the transition.  The new CEO checked all the boxes of girl boss and seemed good intentioned.  A stint in the Air Force, Masters in finance, dutifully working her way up the corporate ladder.  She even went to church on Sundays and voted for the orange man…whats not to like?  Well, after a bit you start to notice she has no clue whats she’s doing and since it was your baby after all, you call her out in a few group zoom calls. I should have gotten the clue with the early corporate speak like “let me unpack this for you”. Instant change in the niceness and the C word became a more accurate discripter.  Needless to say I didn’t get the gold watch.  The good news is my commitment in the transition became a lot less.

            Yeah, calling out underlings in public is one thing, but we are long past the time when the you could do that with someone you did not have the ability to fire. True of either sex. Things like that should be done in private, ideally in person. Making the new boss look incompetent in front of her underlings is definitely bad form.

        This is not meant to be an apologia for these harpies, but I suspect part of why women are like this is that they are taught to have deep distrust of men from an early age by every “cultural organ”.  (Another gift of the chosenites’ feminism)  Because men can never really be trusted the woman must have everything under personal control at all times.  There can be no reliance on a husband, let alone submission, because that invites exploitation.With no limits on their sexuality (sexual revolution!) they follow base instinct and try to capture the “bad boy”/”high status” guys.  The inevitable unfavorable ending of those relations reinforce the distrust and add some bitterness for spice.For a creature that naturally craves security, this way of life is probably very unsettling.  I imagine the mentality of a cornered animal.

        Girl Bosses, Magic Negros, Immivaders, Small Hats, wanna be Oligarchs, and assorted Queers – there’s no end of enemies undermining this place as fast as they can.  Truly, I can’t imagine any remedy short of collapse.  No one will have the stones to wage war on them all.Is the rest of the broader world really all worse?  Pretty hard to believe at this point.  As the madness intensifies, for reasonable people it will eventually come down to exile, whether internal or external.  Personally I’m trying to figure out how to optimize my plan for departure to someplace cheaper, warmer, and saner.

        ‘Like a terrible rash or a fungus, girl boss is slowly taking over everything’The princesses you made will destroy you unless you stop them.‘Her career reads like a Hollywood sketch for the lead in a new television drama. The daughter of a rich local family, she started at Groton and then went to Yale’Rich men, especially of the East Coast, have been fast-tracking their daughters for rulership the past half-century.  The right preps, the right colleges, the assured placement in government or politics.  This overturns the traditional pattern where power, wealth and position was passed from father to son.  Women are the Deep State now.  Girlboss has been going on since the Eighties.Karen is not a new phenomenon.  What we’re witnessing is the broader [read: slow] American Collective at last becoming conscious of the mortal threat is has itself created.  And — like the Dancing Nurses of Covid — we’re seeing what America is like under the rulership of empowered females.Maggie Gooddoer is a new Vicki Nuland in the District of the Goddess Columbia.  America has been turned into a gynarchy, effectively a matriarchy (tho not according to the anthropologists).‘Boudica was a queen of a British tribe who led a failed uprising against the Roman Empire in AD 60’Yeah the only time I rooted for the Romans.  :O)Boudica eventually triumphed because Britain, not Rome, ended up controlling that piece of territory.  She is emblematic of a failing people, but also a premonition of a post-Victorian Britain which is one of the most gynarchic and tyrannical nations in the world.‘All will love me and despair’, indeed.

        Trace it all to 19A. Suffrage OR civilization; it’s a binary choice. Are there any matriarchies in the historical record? Nope. Guess why? Not to forget that the purpose of mythology in any culture is to teach, and Eve, Pandora and Brunhilde ALL were female… for a reason… The problem of girlboss has been known for millennia. We let them into the wild with 19A. If that is not repealed, it will destroy us.

        Perhaps the Girlboss is a centuries-delayed revenge of the Witch?It is hard to know if this character started in the make-believe world of narrative content or if the creators of narrative content borrowed from reality.In culture I think the Millenial-writing might have been influenced partially be the strong females from anime. The main difference is, the women in Japanese entertainment tend to be very serviceable, respecting male fantasies.In western media however, the Strong Female has been growing increasingly abrasive and entitled. From eye-candy warriors and mages to thin hand-to-hand commandos and homely tech-whizzbangs with constant resting bitch-faces. It really shows how ideologically driven things are, compared to the Orient. The Mary Sue archetype is well known to be a self-insert made to cope with personal frustrations of the creator.In politics the answer is likely even more complicated depending on a country. It’s safe to say though, that USA is the origin of the disease, spreading it through mass-culture slop. Remembering my time in school though, I think the Girlboss doesn’t require the input from popular culture in order to happen. All of us met the busybody types that possessed a constant need for validation from the teachers, the American hall monitor figure is probably a good example. Women tend to ingratiate themselves quickly with authorities and the most cunning strivers among them start scheming their way to the most prestigious positions. There’s probably no chicken-egg relationship between the narrative and reality, but a reinforcing feedback loop which results in managerial system adopting the themes from media slop in the propaganda.

        My first experience with Girl Boss was way back in the 80’s.  I was tagged to work on a joint operations Flintlock exercise as an active duty Army CPT, along with an Naval reserve O-3 and a Marine Reserve O-5.  We were working out of EUCOM Headquarters, Patch Barracks.  A Female Air Force O-5 active duty permanent cadre was watching over us part-timers.We went out after work for a good time on the local economy and got in some kind of row with the Germans.  We were laughing about it the next day.  When the Girl Boss Air Force C*** heard she had a fit and dressed down the Marine O-5, who told her to go F herself.Yep, by causing troubles with the locals we might have got in the way of Girl Boss checking her box.  She wasn’t going to tolerate that!

                Wrong person on the cross, if that’s what it’s supposed to be. A better start would be to put a system pig in his uniform up there. Next would be a male conservatard in his Sunday finest. This bootlicker would be followed by a lawyer, preferably one of the “federal” judges who otherwise would have to be chained up with other lawyers and thrown into a deep body of water.Monkeys would be suitably terrified by a demonstration of resolve, and the enforcement system would be headed toward a recruiting crisis. Meanwhile, the gofast pests of “Progressivism” would be wondering when their turn is coming and, probably, holding their tongues like the hypocrites that they are. This will be to their discredit, and later they can be told to stfu when one of their slimiest males is selected as a model punishee for a dramatic, gruesome burning.

                The notion that early modern witch hysteria was a pogrom against empowered wamen speaking their minds is a complete invention by the feminists, and turning it on its head is as boneheaded as “DemoKKKrats are the real racists” or “antifa are the real Nazis”. A large share of those killed were men, most were old, and it didn’t have much of a basis in anything. Also despite clumsy attempts by mostly the same people to pitch it as Rome trying to suppress some sort of matriarchal earth-worship tradition, it was almost exclusive to Protestant lands, and killed five to ten times as many as the Inquisition ever did over a similar period.

        Girl Boss syndrome has its roots in penis envy. Box ticking is a substitute for accomplishment whether male or female. Boy bosses are the same. I always hated working with women with very few exceptions. I have nothing against women. I believe every free white man should own as many as he can afford. Are the best floosies still from France or has that changed?

        The girl boss is bad enough at work but even harder to deal with in a man’s personal time. At least at work, a man is being paid to deal with them. At home, men are paying to deal with them.Just like at work, the girl boss views the various aspects of her social life as a series of boxes to check off without giving any thought to what she offers. So when it comes to picking a man all that matters is getting the top 20 percent (at minimum) who is tall and makes more money than her and don’t you dare suggest she needs to bring anything except her wonderful being to the relationship.Reminds me of the Jewish comedian, Owen Benjamin, saying that white men deserve to be replaced by Somalis because they aren’t having enough kids. Vox Day seconded that and stated that most men are losers who are afraid.Having come back to the US after years in Eastern Asia where most women are slender and attractive, I would not want to be in the shoes of most young men. The average man just isn’t a box most boss girls want to check off. On dating sites, for example, only 30 percent of women are willing to consider men 5’10” which is the average height for men. Generally women compete for the top 10 percent but are willing to settle for 11th to 20th percentile. Eventually a young man can expect an obese single mother will condescend to be with him. Oh joy!

                He doesn’t even live in the USA does he? Yet…and how long has he not lived in the US? Is he learning about American men strictly on the internet now and from his memories of being a US teenager in the 80’s? I have questions. If he is going to go there, then so can we. And wasn’t his dad a famous and rich columnist and he has grown up wanting for nothing to pursue whatever interests he pleases? He may be over his head here, on this subject.

A serious return to Polygamy would destroy the White Race and Western Civilization;Western Civilization having been founded upon the bedrock of {1-Man}/{1-Woman} procreative relationships.Unlike the Tiny Hats, we Europeans are not a naturally polygamous people.

        I come from a family of empowered females and the shit-tests and drama was non-stop. What astounded me was how my elders among the menfolk supported it and tolerated it. The older guys, especially.
In those days dissidents or people that dared to notice and comment on the wrong things – got cancelled. I used to think that was a bad thing but freedom from the estrogen fuelled lunacy is something I came to cherish.
I seriously wonder if men will put an end to this idiocy… or will we have to wait for the women to unfuck themselves?

                Justified, I say as a misogynist.There’s a coordinated-seeming campaign to instruct righty guys that the real problem isn’t race or Jews or finance or cops or whatever butwhite women, often euphemized as the Karen, the AWFL, etc., even the titular girlboss—a distinct vile phenomenon sometimes invoked to redirect hatred of managerialism or the professional class or shitty movie protagonists atwhite women.Don’t fall for that. Know what’s actually wrong with white women, but don’t laugh at what the Babylon Bee tells you to, and don’t blame the people Libs Of Tiktok puts on your screen…with their Star of David necklaces cropped out. (She really did that once.) They’re trying to ruin your life—and white women’s.But also, when Christians and conservatives are stomping about righty misogyny and running theirwomen civilize menroutine—those dudes are gay and their women are fag hags. Keep them from little boys.Hate consciously.

                Most males live in hypnosis and worship of the… in-betwixt-the-legs thing; they extend the sense of reverence to the concept of woman.Plus: the neurolinguistical programming has been louder and more pressing on the “woman equality” than “there is no race” malicious fantasy over the last years. The most susceptible minds are going to be triggered more if they hear someone think independently on the first issue, for now.

        We’re going to see more of this, not less. There’s big money to be made as a political entrepreneur. These girls needn’t be back-room harridans anymore like Waters or Warren. They can be prime-time media darlings like AOC. Running a start-up or working in a hedge fund is exhausting and difficult. Any reasonably-attractive girl with a good resume would be way better off as a political entrepreneur. How many girl-boss types of AOC’s vintage have made as much money as AOC since graduation? Her success will attract a lot more competition on both sides of the aisle.

            Yes. A more important force will be the oligarchs themselves want this kind of harmless dog and pony show.As things move forward I am convinced that with the promotion of Larry Ellison and others, the oligarchs are taking an Esau strategy to their rule. They ride one whip hand to exhaust and demoralize. When the energy is tired it moves to say MAGA. Fine. They switch to that and continue with the agenda, (2030 for now), and construct the panopticon to crush campus heresy and do deportations only of criminals as if they are not all criminals.Of course there are factions that do not agree. However, given the system is both carrot of positive media coverage and soon no censorship and the bribes they call, “campaign contributions”, with the sticks of negative media coverage, censorship and defunding you to bribe a rival they just switch as they need to.AOC is perfectly happy to play her role in her Eat The Rich dresses one day and a Occupy Mars dress the next.It is all a dog and pony show and Eyepatch Dan and AOC get their orgies, private jets, Bali resorts … … and they will say and sign anything they are told to as long as they pretend to have a genuine belief.

        I’ve had many female managers in my career.  To be fair, some were decent early on.  Nowadays, I avoid them like the plague.  My director in my current job is a girl boss.  To her credit, she is actually smart, but she’s what you’d expect.  She’s 49, single, never been married and has no kids.  She lives in a trendy apartment downtown.  Like all of the wahmen in my company, anything they do is to be celebrated.  The same accomplishments by a man are just expected, but for the wahmen, it’s like they climbed Everest.  This is the same bullshit we see with the black retards.  Anything they say or do is met with a head pat.  I have literally been counting the years until I can get out.My wife works in the law enforcement field, but she is a civilian.  Her co workers are all women – 6 of them total including the boss.  She can’t stand it.  There is ridiculous, junior high level drama every day.  Bitching, moaning, whining to the point where she doesn’t want to go to work.  This is the price of feminism.  I love my wife and I lucked out finding her, but if I hadn’t, there’s zero chance I’d not stay have stayed single.

        The box ticking girl boss is interesting because to women, the ticked box IS the accomplishment to which all the money, awards and accolades flow.  It is never about producing anything of actual value (as Z states) or improving conditions for your organization, it is only about racking up credentials for vanity purposes.  They never have to worry about accountability.  If her ‘team’ succeeds she gets all the credit and is promoted, if her ‘team’ fails she blames it on some nebulous social justice related excuse and is promoted anyways. This is the most frustrating dichotomy between men and women; men care about results whereas women care about appearances.  As long as we’re in an age of abundance, I don’t see how this changes.

        Girl-boss to me is like a Stepford wife but programmed to be the exact opposite of what the Stepford wives were programmed to be. But they have that same sort of soulless vibe and the buzzwords and they probably all do have an alarm programmed to tell them when it’s time to take their brainwash pill.

        A comprehensive review of our ridiculous feminized politics and society…But “girl boss” can be simply summarized as a woman who never does or did any actual work, but is an expert on manipulating men’s gullibility…it’s a pure act….which doesn’t work as well on working women…My wife was an actual girl and boss, who worked long hours, and she would shitcan such people…..

            Yes. But this is just a performative/ceremonial dismissal. She did the most important deed. She introduced the pogrom of Whites and the acceleration of our cultural genocide in moving images at Amazon in 2020. The formal racial apportionment, “guidelines”, are not gone. She has her money, her network and will not have her rewards for doing this work of The Regime taken away.
This is a classic tactic. Remove the figurehead/manager and keep the policy and hope the plebs are stupid enough to accept that this is reform.

        Let’s also say, since we definitely shall, that:A small % of the small % of women who become “girl bosses” has the skills for the job. These are the obvious naturals, who’d climb to the kind of position well before compulsory feminism and the non-stop propaganda barrage imposing the most counter-truth of beliefs on the impressionable minds (the propaganda targets); these ones make real career, prevail in real competition, and their CV is as substantial as that of a male peer.The others are made possible, not first but most of all, by the fact that the twat-worshipers, most “men”, will treat the “girl boss” amidst their ranks by the completely softened and altered set of rules by which they handle and regard every woman — consciously or unconsciously that it be. Synthetic, box-ticking, xweeting “girl bosses” would resign and absquatulate from boss world in short time, if they were subjected to stressors equal to that their male career peers negotiate and survive in their life.

Obviously you have never worked around nurses in an hospital.
Yuge numbers of them are Girl Boss Lady MacBeths, just waiting, chomping at the bit, for the opportunity to humiliate you.
These days, the nurses are behaving so horribly that I now suspect legions of them to be harboring outright Von Munchhausen’s by Proxy tendencies.

                    The steady northward creep of nursing salaries has probably attracted a type of woman to the profession who previously wasn’t. It’s simultaneously possible that we’ve seen something happen with nursing that we’ve also seen with teaching. Used to be, a lot of smart women were teachers and nurses (and secretaries) because those were the only jobs women could get. Nowadays the smart ones have more opportunities elsewhere, so the teaching profession suffers, secretaries have been mostly eliminated, and nursing suffers too, in spite of the increased pay.

                        Actually, not the majority, they were drawn by recruiting and the chance to be around lots of women. (Although there is, admittedly, a pretty large minority that are.)
Often it’s a result of settling for second best in a medical career; divorce has ruined a lot of career tracks, as has the cost of college. So has putting up with women’s chit, that is indeed a nightmare on the floor; men will go for alternates such as administration, education, or a specialty.

            About to be given a girlboss movie remake, I’ve heard.The book is interesting. Wild hyperbolic expression of homo misogyny, displaced onto…a Trump fan. That didn’t mean the same thing back then as it does now. Now it’s more interesting.The movie isn’t like that, not least because a woman made it. So it’s more like theindictment of ’80s yuppie materialist “schizophrenia”—they’re largely the same people who were hippies—that the book wasn’t really.She’s very angry that right-wingers think Patrick Bateman is funny. She can’t understand us putting pictures of him all over the world without admiring him, so she thinks we do.The remake is supposed to address that, presumably in the same wayJoker 2owned theJokerfans. He gonna get raped (“pegged,” probably). And he’ll be a Trump fan.

        I’m a supporter of meritocracy but I feel that meritocracy inevitably evolves into a sort of striverocracy or credentialocracy.

        It’s an iron clad workplace rule that if you have three women in a branch or division, don’t work there.  It’ll be a catty hellscape of passive aggressive female drama.  If those three women are 1-2-3 in your chain of command, leave NOW.This is true for men, even though most men can quickly find a way to go around them and still get work done.  It’ll mainly just suck having to live with the drama.  The people who suffer most?  Woman #4 who will be ostracized and othered by the main 3 women.Women are condescending and matronizing towards men in the office.  But they are vicious and indescribably cruel towards other women.  Especially Girl Bosses, because they are trying to appeal to the dominant males and other girl bosses in the hierarchy.

        Down from the waist they are centaurs, though women all above. But to the girdle do the gods inherit; beneath is all the fiend’s. There’s hell,there’s darkness, there is the sulphurous pit; burning, scalding, stench, consumption! Fie, fie, fie, pah, pah!

        The owners picked a female CEO for whatever reason, but she’s in Tampa and we only see her occasionally.  She looks good in jeans and boots and I call her Boss Lady when I see her.She can dice it up with the guys, but I’m still careful when she asks me about work.  We have enough rules already, thank you.

You do realize that that pμ$$y is yours, if you want it, right?
Women LOVE covert office place romances.
That’s why they go to work every day:Office place romances.
All you gotta do is simply hold frame.
Gangsta pimp hand is your friend.

                    Bro, you only live ONCE.
Do you wanna be gasping for breath, on your deathbed, longing for that P00nt@ng you could have had, but which you walked away from, on account of something as patently ridiculous &amp; absurd as, “Muh Principles”?
PRO-TIP: Don’t be that nice of a Nice Guy Loser.
Be Chad Thundercock.
Your life will be so much happier.

                Easy, bubba, easy, sometimes they just want a ‘teddy bear’.An escort, somebody they can trust. And a guard dog if need be, of course.
I had one blonde bombshell boss take me to a big gay club to see a singer she liked. They put her table front and center, spotlit and all; those fags swanned and swooned around her like butterflies.
