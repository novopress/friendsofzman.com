        I’m in the Army and I’m just not hearing all these complaints about the lethality of the M4 and the 5.56 mm ammo we are using.  I think someone is making this stuff up or is cherry picking soldier comments that support their agenda.

            Yeah, that puzzled me a little. The bit about the jihadis taking 3 or 4 rounds before stopping made me think they had acquired some form of body armor. Or, they acquired very very thick skin. Something is not right.
