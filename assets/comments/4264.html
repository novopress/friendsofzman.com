        What amazes me is, over a relatively short period, the whole focus of the argument has shifted from a desire for equality under the law viz their partnership unions to a broader one that focuses on the alleged equivalence of these bonds with marriage.  Even if you put aside any religious arguments, for a moment, the proposition is ridiculous. Socially speaking the monogamous pair bond represents the successful strategy for the propagation of that same society. Until relatively recent medical innovations this was not possible for the medically barren as well as gay folks.But as you mention, the “Homitern” won’t be contended with mere equality any more. They will brook no dissent, there can be no public disagreement with their lifestyle choices. And, anything less than a full throated approval, affirmation, and celebration of their lifestyle has now become de facto oppressive hatred.Members of the KKGay will accept nothing less, and those not thinking right thoughts will be subject to their mob.

        I just finished a recent autobiography of Charlemagne. (No, he wasn’t gay; he was actually quite an Alpha male hetero)  As he consolidated his empire, more and more non-Franks came under his dominion.  To provide a cohesive ideology for his diverse subjects he pursued a rigorous reform of the Church, standardizing all aspects, both lay and clerical.  Nothing escaped his notice, theology, liturgy, hymnals, texts, preaching and religious education.  Most of his subjects including his own Franks were CHINOS (Christian in Name Only) who carried on most of their pre-christian rituals and folk beliefs.  He wasn’t above making examples of those who didn’t go along with the program.  Especially the Saxons, who were almost continually in revolt.  In one reprisal Charles, son of Pepin, executed 4.500 Saxon apostates.

        Boy Scouts Of America have managed to hold out against homosexuals being given leadership positions. Major corporations have punished this proud organisation by stopping donations to them. I tend to think the BSA would be finished within 5 years if it should start accepting homosexuals as leaders. White middle-class parents can tut-tut all they want over those who don’t accept how wonderful homosexuals are but I can bet London to a brick that they wouldn’t want their sons to go into to the woods on the weekend with two married gay men in charge. I know if I wanted to destroy the white, male, Christian community – the BSA would be high on my list to to put a line through.

        It has always seemed to me that homosexuals are perpetually stuck in adolescence; preoccupation with attention seeking and genitalia.  I have had several queer acquaintances and have observed a degree of selfishness not normally seen in heterosexuals.  Those engaged in the business of raising the next generation are accustomed to giving most all to their mates and offspring, willingly.  Parenting, or should I say good parenting,  leaves little time for “clubbing”, social networking, evening meetings at cause groups, etc.  That might contribute in part to the “success” of the homintern.  Or, maybe not, I don’t really understand homosexuality. It really does seem more than just a sexual proclivity.

            Certainly part of their success is the disposable time, and maybe more importantly within the US, the disposable income…Money can sway a lot of folks to trade away their personal views of morality; especially when their views are informed exclusively be secular beliefs. It’s also a near-aphrodisiac for politicians. And regardless of lifestyles, wealthy folks are afforded a greater degree of respect in modern America than members of the lower classes.Where does this wealth come from? One can’t deny that a greater number of gay folks are in educated, white collar jobs; one’s which generally pay well. As someone who used to live in DC for many years, I can also tell you that there are many in federal service and at the law firms that feed at the political trough, so to speak. And though many gay couples are adopting, and otherwise having, children it is not the predominant lifestyle choice among that group yet; which, those with children immediately comprehend the material savings this represents.These all contribute to their material wealth and time to commit to other pursuits. So what seems self-serving may be just the “playboy” like lifestyle that their choice provides for.  But there is also no denying that the same societal message the relativism and the supposed equal validity of all truth claims, and by extension life choices, where one is encouraged to focus on self and desires, so you can “have it all!”, that same mindset that justifies and celebrates their position in modern society is also adhered to by these same groups.

        The whole Severan Dynasty is quite interesting because it shows that by the end of the 2nd Century AD the Roman Empire was already full “orientalized”, the Severans were of mixed Roman and Punic/Syrian stock, The Semitic God El Gabal (Heliogabalus to the Romans) was worshipped as stone like the one in Meccah and they wanted to make the main God for all the Empire.

            The Severan Dynasty also produced some outlandishly bad characters and not just the emperors. The thing I like about that period is it shows just how far along in the process of eating the seed corn they were. The Severans force you to retrace your steps and think about when Rome really began to decline. That provides some useful example of how leader addressing immediate concerns make addressing future problems more difficult and complicated.

                I’m not as scholarly as you fellows vis-à-vis the history of Rome, but my personal feeling is that the decline, at least in their society, began sometime between the end of the Republic and the time of Nero. But most definitely by the time the Gracchi come on the scene a century later.

        Not to worry, all these identity groups will end up devouring each other. The fight to be at the top of the victim heap will leave them all dead or critically wounded.

        I have been going on about this. Homosexuals can’t be discreet and behave normally, as we are expected to believe they will, because they have a deep need to be seen as normal. Since most people don’t see them this way, they must seek power to force others to accept them as normal. But they know that most people are only doing this out of fear, so forcing more and more assent is necessary. It’s the same process as leftists totalitarian singularity.
