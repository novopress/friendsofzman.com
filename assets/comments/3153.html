        Although Congress is the first among the three “equal” branches of government, as is clearly indicated by its establishment in the first and longest article of the Constitution, it does no good for the Republicans to control Congress when the presidency is occupied by a man of the opposition party who shows no respect for that founding document, since he can always veto any bill that Congress passes.  The Republicans will not be able to accomplish much until their party also occupies the White House, which can only occur by means of a two step strategy:  win control of Congress today, and do enough in the next two years to win the Presidential election in 2016.  Victory today means nothing without a win in 2016.  Victory today is only the first step to saving America from losing its soul.  Today is just the semi-finals.  2016 is the finals.  Don’t lose sight of that fact.

        the left turning defeats into victories reminded me of an eric hoffer quote i’ve always liked: It still holds true that man is most uniquely human when he turns obstacles into opportunities.
the power to reframe experiences to serve arbitrary objectives is what differentiates the political winners from political losers.

        Of course the Rs will compromise &amp; “get things done.” If they gain control they can’t just sit back protesting while the D’s take all the blame for growing the gov for all politicians, Lobbyists &amp; the connected crowd. “Thar’s gold in them thar [Bills].”ACA pushed DC past Silicon Valley in wealth. Several press reports of the “rivers of $” that will flow to DC through 2022 to “fix” it. Soon after passage a Lobbyist headhunter overwhelmed with positions to fill said “Biden was right, it’s a big f**king deal.”Romney said “there are parts I like.” Gingrich was for the individual mandate into 2011. Several R-pols have written &amp; been on TV saying “it’ll be hard to reverse.” Kasich just told AP re Rs repealing ACA: “That’s not gonna happen.” McConnell: “No one thinks a GOP Senate could repeal Obamacare.” Other headlines” “Republicans downplaying ACA repeal.”Many in the GOP do admire the Ds but not their tenacity, but rather that they’ve corralled a base of support that lets ’em do what they say, “Grow gov grow. Take all the money from everybody. Business does not create jobs. Share the wealth. It takes a village.. . . grow gov grow!”The Rs want similar things, especially the dough, but have to pretend otherwise, lying thru their teeth &amp; eyes. Not that they mind as they are politicians after all, but some of their base is suspicious and like Shakespeare have observed, “The lady doth protest too much, methinks.”

        The Democrats ability to stay on message, close ranks, and use their strategic War on Women and Racist! cards to undercut any threat is what gives them a leg up. The Left has come to a place where they actually believe the BS that comes out of their mouths. “Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.” –Proverbs
