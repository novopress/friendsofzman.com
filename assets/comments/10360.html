        I got to the part where Wood says that Derbyshire was fired from NR because he was a racist, and stopped reading. It confirmed for me that Wood is a hater. I say this because it is axiomatic that whatever liberals are accusing their enemies of, it is something they themselves are most guilty of.

            Yes, I marveled at that one also. It’s amazing how Woods could write that sentence and still believe he has a claim to any shred of journalistic integrity.
But of course, that’s Z-man’s point here, isn’t it?

        A “manufactured reasons to pull together toward a common goal” seems to be what the propositional nation is. To tell people of various ethnicities and belief systems to pull together under the banner of a flag for an Olympic sporting event seems to work well. For anything larger, like a nation,it will only function in times of prosperity (and even then the edges fray, since America at its pinnacle was still rife with internal tensions, re: race). The reality is that people throughout history have felt kinship and loyalty to people most like themselves, and those most likely to survive into the future will also probably orient themselves around this inescapable fact. Spencer is not shy about addressing this reality, and, since the mandarins hate reality, they naturally hate Spencer.Their desire to place him among past movements (especially Hitler’s Nazis) also helps distort the fact that whatever Spencer is, he is also a reaction to rabid identity politics and anti-white sentiment on the left. If Hitler had never existed, Spencer still would. I also think that he pisses off leftists because they are (contra their assertions) very superficial and obsessed with appearances, and Spence does project himself in a fashionable and presentable way. If William Buckley taught us anything, it is that the left has to take someone on the right seriously if they look good in a suit. They can’t shout “Go back to the trailer park” to Spencer and thusly rid themselves of his meddlesome presence.

            History shows that people exactly like one another have oftentimes held more enmity for one another than perfect strangers would. I only wish to point out that it is people most similar to me that are in the greatest need of strangling before a saner world emerges, whereas our attention is drawn to  their proxies of dysfunction, leaving the schemers untouched. No African, no Asian, no Mestizo yet spent his life trying to put something over on me. I cannot envision how to defeat them either with violence or with persuasion. They represent our worser instincts all too well.

                No, you are incorrect. History shows that people almost exactly like one another (with one sometimes minor difference) oftentimes have held more enmity for one-another than perfect strangers would. Freud was wrong about almost everything, but he was right about the narcissism of slight difference. Black people from the same neighborhood (and same gene pool) will kill each other over a difference in the color of their baseball cap (blue or red), and whites groups, both Christian but differing in denomination, will slaughter each other to the last man. Or at least, this was the case for quite some time in the past.One of the few benefits of all the anti-white animus is that for people like Spencer there is a genuine chance for the kind of pan-white consciousness which has never existed before (but that doesn’t mean it is doomed in the future). Regionalism is strong in America, but from New Scandinavia to Dixie to the Sun Belt, whites overwhelmingly oppose lax immigration from the Middle East, South and Central America. That means something.

                        Either you are joking or you lost your credibility with that statement.Barack Obama is a political pop star who was manufactured for popular consumption by leftist elites in media and finance in much same way that entertainment pop stars are manufactured by Hollywood.A mediocre student at Punahou (I have an acquaintance whose father taught Obama at Punahou and describes him as a dim-witted stoner) he was groomed, if not sired, by communist agitator Frank Marshall Davis. After a brief stint at Occidental College our mediocre student Obama gained admission to the prestigious Columbia University, coincidentally home of the Frankfurt School and the Saudi-sponsored School of International and Public Affairs.Whisked into Harvard Law with the assistance of Dr. Khalid al-Mansour, advisor to the Saudi royal family, Obama exited Harvard into a brief stint at a small law firm while focusing on community organizing, i.e., socialist agitating. His political career was launched in the living room of former Weatherman Bill Ayers and his meteoric rise thereafter was sponsored and manufactured by the left.

            Liberals go ape at the thought of Richard Spenser because he his liberal who likes white people, has read a few history books, and demographics charts. Otherwise there is no functional difference in Spenser’s outlook versus the average liberal. He’s a heretic of the worst the kind, because they could easily be him as well, if they were more honest.

        There are two kinds of people in the world, the realists and the dreamers.  The realists understand that the world we inhabit is the one we’ve got, and that the average person has little say in the bigger scheme of things.  The realists work to make their own lives, and the lives of the people around them, just a little bit better, and find meaning in doing that good work.  The dreamers (theme song, Lennon’s “Imagine”) have big ideas, but no way to meaningfully implement them, so they lash out and get frustrated.  They blame and they criticize, they attack and they harm.  It is just who they are. Abetted by those who manipulate them to their own selfish ends, these dreamers, who have no place in a less wealthy and free society, thrive with their browbeating and shaming.People are who they are, there is no changing people’s hearts and minds.  Engagement is useless, and just hardens people’s positions.  One must understand this about people, accept it, and then structure one’s own life to accommodate the people around you.  It is why people self-segergate.

        the managerial class will stop eating the lotus right up until the point someone walks up to them and sticks a spear in their liver.  they can’t change, they are who they will always be.  circumstances in the economy will change however, and eventually wipe out the parasites and useless.  and then it all starts again.

                    Collective bargaining, that old canard, you must be a libertarian or a Bush Republican. You do realize most American workers in the private sector don’t have it.You realize the current predicament of the dirt people is a direct result of the white Managerial class along with both political parties imposing their agenda on them in the form of free trade, off-shoring of jobs, industry. The importation of foreign workers and parasites. All of which has put many millions into poverty and dysfunction, ruined entire communities, etc.They have every reason to dismember and cook the managerial and political class for the destruction they have heaped upon the dirt people.They’re evil and deserve.

                        There is an area on the coast, where we are considering buying a home. The economy there was ruined when the state decided to stop dredging the bay. They used to bring logs into the local sawmills. Can’t do that any more. The two counties on the coast went for Trump, which didn’t happen a lot in WA state.
And I have lived in other areas where they killed logging so they could have a tourist economy.

                        No, I am not a Republican, Bush, Ray-gun, Trump, or otherwise.  I am not a Democrat either.Of course, today, the vast majority of private sector workers are not unionized.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 2016, approximately 7.4 million private sector employees (6.4%) were unionized whereas 7.1 million (34.4%) in the public sector were unionized.However, the fact is that a significant percentage of the white workforce was unionized throughout the 20th century.  In fact, at one time, from say the mid 50s  to the early 60s, over a third of the workforce was unionized.  The total number of unionized jobs peaked in the late 1970s, although this was after the percentage of unionized jobs had begun to fall.Collective bargaining may have afforded union members benefits but those benefits were outweighed by all of the costs, including, but not limited to, artificially high employee wages which resulted in higher prices, a decline in purchasing power for the consumer of the goods made by unionized shops, reduction in competition, bloated health care plans which, to some extent, cause GM and other companies to go bankrupt, higher housing costs, graft, fertile ground for organized crime to insert itself in the management and overseeing of union money and pensions, a decline in initiative and work ethic (ever hear of sick days, time and a half, overtime, paid holidays, disability, and featherbedding?), and an impediment to free and vigorous competition.If A starts a company, why should be forced to collectively bargain with a collection of white dirt people who have not invested a dime of their own money in the enterprise?  If the white dirt people do not want to work for A, they are free to go.If B wants to work for C, why should B be forced to join a union?Notice, the dirt white man has to rely upon force, upon the state or the mob, to get his goodies.  That is a proposition for losers.The dirt white man should concentrate upon elevating himself from dirt status and becoming a rugged individual – a real man who makes and produces and serves upon a voluntary and consensual basis.  Be a man who provides real value.To be sure, the progressive overlords for whom the white dirt people have voted over and over again have waged war on them by making it harder to start and operate a business.  Witness the thousands and thousands of pages of regulations that the administrative state, a progressive staple, adds each year to the Federal Register.The courts, staffed by the appointments of Presidents and governors elected by the dirt white people, are and have been, hostile to the entrepreneurial white dirt people who are the real backbone of our society.I note that you did not say boo about the social welfare narcotic to which the white dirt people have so eagerly attached themselves.

                            Just in case you’ve forgotten, unions came out of a period when it was common to live in company housing and buy your food with script at the company store. We aren’t just talking about walking away from a job. We’re talking about losing the roof over your head and not having cash you could use to buy groceries at a regular store.
I’d recommend you take a look at “The Most They Ever Had” by Rick Bragg (http://a.co/gmpLt9n).

                    Skills don’t disappear in changing circumstances. Many of those you mention are already making part of their living in an off the grid economy that may be as much as 20% of undetected GDP.  They will barter favors amongst each other while those unable to will starve.One would think that such circumstances would be something a self described libertarian would look forward to, but considering that the individualists will not organize, they will either change their stripes and learn cooperative living or die.

                        Doc, above you write about examination with a critical eye.
Now, did I register a negative opinion of barter, the black market, or the off the grid economy?
As for  cooperative living, it is voluntary and consensual exchange – the heart of libertarianism.

I think he believes in ruthless accuracy.The “reasoning” of the various camps, endlessly repeated and rarely persuading, is mostly hope mixed in with a few accurate bits.
What such hoots and calls are not- is comprehensively accurate.  They are none of them a description of the world as it actually is.

                                        You are conflating libertarianism with surrender.This is a mistake often made by those who self-identify as dissident right, alt-right, as well as those who do not understand that the white man’s problems were entirely of his own making because it is the white man who has given us communism, progressivism, and socialism.  It is the white man who has given us the warfare / welfare state.The libertarian, the anarchist, and the voluntaryist all reject the initiation of force, not the use of force to defend oneself or one’s family and friends.However, it has been the white man, through his slavish devotion to the empire, to the nation state, to its symbols, and to its warfare / welfare programs, who is the wanker and who has surrendered.You are smart enough to see through the canard authored and repeated by the likes of Z and other cry baby whites that libertarianism equals capitulation to bad actors.  It is just nonsense on stilts.  It is just so sophomoric.You are better than that.

        I used to get in arguments on a Peak Oil forum. These folks wanted society to collapse and I couldn’t figure out why. It’s like the folks that claim to want anarchy. Why would anyone really want that?
It dawned on me that the reason they wanted society to collapse was to force them to live a different life. They weren’t happy with their current lives, but couldn’t bring themselves to make changes. They wanted events to make those changes for them.

You seem to believe that anarchy: lack of a coercive government, is the same as disorder.
Now why would you think that?

        You have such an incredible way of mapping today’s events into the eternal nature of man across history. The way you teach history and current events is really one of the things that I love about your writing. I look forward to it every day. I have a 20 year old son and he is only now beginning to realize that he has been living in a fantasy world his entire life. Somehow thinking that everything I have ever told him about hard work, personal responsibility, etc. etc. is just a set of old fables that only apply to me. Perhaps one day I can get him to start reading your work. You do the world a service.

        “The people in charge, on the other hand, are living a fantasy version of life. It’s why they are not concerned with the consequences of their polices. They simply don’t think of the consequences. They focus on how good it makes them feel.”I disagree. I admit that while some of the people in charge on lower levels of control may be described by this condition, the “people in charge” know exactly what they are doing and have for centuries. The only question that remains is will they retain control of the sleeping tiger they sit upon or will they lose it? And, if they lose it, will they withdraw and continue to scheme to get control back or will they attempt to destroy mankind out of revenge?

        I suspect that future historians will note that we passed the tipping point here in the USA sometime during the past generation, and it’s been a slow slide downward ever since. If you add up the cloud inhabitants, the useful idiots, the crazies, and the parasites; they are clearly in the majority now. Our masters in DC continue to keep the plates spinning by fleecing foreign labor via phantom borrowing, but what happens when they figure our they’ve been screwed and the borrowing will never be repaid?

            I suspect that future historians will be astonished by the SPEED of our downfall.  Compared to past empires, America has risen higher and fallen harder and faster than anything in history.  Empire life spans are definitely shortening, but Britain’s lasted 100 years.  America was all-powerful by 1990, and in just 20 years threw it all away.

        That’s democracy for you.  I’m not being (entirely) flip — an aristocracy that *knows* it’s an aristocracy lives a meaningful life, just by being aristocratic.  They follow fashion, sponsor art, patronize literature, all that.  A lot of it was silly, but it kept them busy.  These guys?  They want to homogenize everything, because “elitism” is the worst sin the 1% can ever commit.  It’s gonna be bad.

        Z Man;Yet another great essay.  I always wonder where you are going at the start and am amazed and delighted where you end up: The Land of the Lotus Eaters, is The Heart of Darkness is Cloud World inhabited by nasty, insecure, mixed Asians.  Did Wood miss *any* possible opportunity to denigrate Richard Spencer as, “Not one of our kind, dear”_?And yet…  Wood doesn’t know what kind he is and is drawn to Spencer’s icky ideas.  So it is darkly amusing that the Han, the other half of the author’s genome, are even more culturally/ethnically/racially supremacist than Spencer is.  They just don’t feel the need to crow in public about it to us inferior beings 🙂

        Good Essay Mr. Zre: Graeme Wood’s Attack1) Nazi haircut of Spencer. Look at the article (link in Z-man’s essay) and see photo of Spencer’s head. He has sideburns. The NAZI style has No sideburns. The hair is shaved off straight across the top of the ear. It is striking to see. I first saw it on a friend I met in the mid 70s who was a former Luftwaffe fighter pilot. What stories he had to tell! He was brilliant, an engineer, had married a stunning lady who was the daughter of an Atomic scientist, but he died young from a stroke age 59. Most people never suspected the story behind his hair cut which he wore all of his adult life.2) Graeme did go to Harvard. I wonder if his being a halfbreed got him in as an Affirmative Action, minority admit. Spencer went to Colgate. Colgate University is a prestigious place and rather expensive, a decade ago it was the most expensive college in America. I should know as my sister’s son went there after turning down a number of Ivys. He was wait-listed at Harvard in spite of SATs of 800, 800, A+ essay.3) Nazi salutes. The supposed Nazi salutes Graeme Wood writes about are Hollywood concocted Roman salutes. Alleged by some is that Mussolini saw the salute in some silent films about Ancient Rome and adopted them.Dan Kurt

                @khHarry was not a mechanical engineer but he had the reputation of being the most knowledgable mechanic in the region. After the war and his finishing his university education in Germany he somehow acquired a two engine freight plane and was delivering freight in South America. He found out that the authorities in South America would demand he have certified mechanics service his plane at a significant cost. Harry came to the USA and took training in radial engine mechanics and became USA certified so he didn’t need to use the South American mechanics.Years later when I knew him he occasionally drove a Jaguar XK-E (V-12, monocoque construction, coupé). A friend who as a hobby restored cars told me how Harry got the car for a pittance. My friend almost worshiped Harry because of his mechanical skills.The SK-E was delivered to customer living in San Diego The customer was troubled by the oder of gasoline that could be smelled while driving. The dealer’s mechanics, as well as a Jaguar regional trouble shooting mechanic as well as an engineer employed by Jaguar went over the car but could not find the problem. Jaguar took back the car and placed the car for auction. Harry somehow heard of the auction, he lived in Santa Barbara County, bid on the vehicle and got the car at a steep discount.Harry reasoned that the competent Jaguar technical people had searched and searched for a cause and could not find the gasoline leak so the leak had to be small and hidden. Because the car was of monocoque construction (no frame) it was made of many spot welds, perhaps a defective weld involving the fuel tank existed. Harry after getting the car used some type of epoxy resin to cover each possible area of a weld around the fuel tank and adjoining structure. It worked, the gasoline smell never returned.Dan Kurt

        A photo of our Odysseus is here (a picture is worth a thousand words):

Please note his immaculately groomed resume; he’s spent a considerable amount of time burnishing it.  This silly, plush manlet is as representative a member in good standing of our managerial class as one could manufacture, and thus a perfect mouthpiece for its idiotic pieties.

            As one of the few female voices here on the blog, and probably the only one so bluntly crude, allow me to honestly say- Mr. Wood may perhaps also be a little jealous of Mr. Spencer’s alpha male, Anglo Saxon good looks. If Richard is what Nazis look like, circa 2017, hell, sign me up!Unfortunately for Mr. Wood, he is decidedly quite unf*ckable, (apologies Zman, for using that term), but there’s really nothing else that so accurately gets to the heart of it, from a female POV.Most women would follow Richard off of a cliff, I (&amp; vast majority of chicks), wouldn’t follow Mr. Wood to a diamond encrusted salon.Something Woods either is oblivious to, discounts, or assumes is false data, perhaps.

        Wow. Perfect examination of Western culture’s state of mind.Well done. Never ceases to amaze me how perceptive the Greeks wearing togas and sandals were of human nature. Probably because they were not addicted to electronic devices and mass media like we are today, giving them the solitude to think and ponder about the human condition.

            the thing is, today’s educational system is mostly a test of memorization.  real life is a lot more complex than “school reality” and the ability to see disparate things and synthesize information from them, is not something that can be taught.  the supposedly good life as a “knowledge worker” is actually sterile and stunting; it is prison like and inhumane.  I get far more enjoyment and satisfaction from a good BM than I have gotten from my career in the last 5 years.

            Barring an economic collapse/WW3/SMOD, the (((media))) is the cornerstone. Without it, the cloud people cannot brainwash the slaves.  The internet and alternative media have distorted the signal from their hegemonic megaphones, but until they flee in terror, their Talmudic slave planet project will continue, with helpful crises created from whole cloth when needed to grease the skids.

        They want to remain in the languid land of ‘seems’ but at some level they know it is self-deception. The dissenters, the people who left the island, are a reminder of that and they hate them for it. The old saw about people not being able to handle too much reality is certainly true. It has always been true.
Seems (ha!) like the Classical allusion that illustrates this thought is Plato’sAllegory of the Cave.

        The frantic losers who consume MSM products remind me more and more of a school of bait-fish or krill. The media effluvium they permit to scare them only causes them to ball-up even tighter, just like sardines or herring will when they’re spooked by a marlin’s sudden dorsal fin-flash.  Or when dolphins corral them.Of course, the tighter the ball the easier it is for the predators to feed on the bait-ball from above and below.This simile is perfect because the Democrat media intends to feed on its engineered school of frenzied minnows.  Watch footage of a sardine school being herded by a pod of dolphins just before they plunge into the mass of stupid bait.  There’s the Democrats’ media strategy in a nut-shell.To any remaining card-carrying Democrats in Z’s readership, do not donate money to Dems.  You’re only feeding yourself to your tormentors.Don’t be a stupid bait fish!

        In one of Robert Howard’s “Conan” stories, the lotus eaters of Xuthal spend their days dreaming but are eaten by a monster who preys on them.  Rather than do anything about the monster, they consume more of the lotus.  Thus, the city was slowly depopulated.  LaFond or someone else will  have to jog my memory but I believe some of them woke up and actually attacked Conan and he decided to take his chances again in the badlands.
