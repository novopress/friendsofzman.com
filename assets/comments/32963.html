        I am 93, lived in the ‘hood (same house) 63 years and blame the fear culture for the decline in Halloween jollity. COVID was the apotheosis of that fear culture which, it is said, began with the milk carton pix of missing children. Everyone around me seems afraid: germs, Russians, borders, meat …

        I live in Florida and I’m shocked by the enthusiasm towards Halloween, being a Midwest transplant and from where Halloween had been slowly dying for 40 years. The decorations here are more carefully thought out than the ones for Christmas. Our neighborhood was full of trick-or-treaters and parents milling about, and lots of socialization going on. Kids would play together and the adults would hang out near their garages, often drinking alcohol. It’s like 1982 all over again.I heard Halloween is even more intense in Alabama.This may be a “southern thing”. I’m not sure why Southerners love Halloween so much, but they do. Our neighborhood by the way is pretty mixed demographically…a diverse middle-class neighborhood that Liberals would love to showcase. We didn’t have packs of young blacks asking for candy gibs nor vans full of Hispanics vacuuming up the treats. Though I did see a little Hispanic girl who was dressed as Ella fromFrozen, which was…interesting.The T-or-T’ers were majority white, though, as our neighborhood is probably just above 50% white. Definitely the most intricate Halloween decorations were on the white families’ homes.

            For one thing, it ends to be warmer down south in late October. For another, southerners aren’t as suspicious of their neighbors as folks from the northeast are (with reason), although that probably doesn’t apply to the midwest in general.

        Derbyshire calls North Korea “a threat to world peace.” It is interesting to note that North Korea hasn’t started a war with anyone since the armistice was signed in 1953. Since 1953 the US has gone around the world starting wars of choice, destabilizing governments, killing civilians all over the world, and operating as the worlds largest distributor of arms. It’s not merely embarrassing for a US citizen to call North Korea a threat to world peace, it’s, well, I can’t think of a term that really captures the magnitude of the hypocrisy.

            Alone among ICBM launching capable nations, only NK launches without warning.
They’re nuclear capable.
Fook NK.

                Meanwhile the US drones civilians without warning. Fook the US.
And Libya would be better off if it had been nuked than what the US did to it.

        It seems like Halloween, like other holidays has been kind of institutionalized, so instead of trick or treating in the hood, kids go to parties.  Our neighborhood was rich in kids years ago, but they grew up, moved away and weren’t replaced.  Regarding our supposed leadership, it’s much worse than incompetence, it’s malevolent incompetence…

        No doubt about it, the west is indeed waking up to the reality of the GR. Now that the GR has progressed past the point where it is a fait accompli.Perhapsthere was still a chance to reverse it at the time Trump was elected in 2016, but that opportunity was squandered/resisted, and it is an uncleansable stain on Trump that he didn’t clearly enunciate that the GR was what the 2020 election was about, and make it the centerpiece of the campaign. Since that would have simply been telling the truth.

        a Trump administration will at least point us in the right direction, and perhaps move us a few inches forwardinthat direction.
A Trump administration will be too busy fighting with Congress (no matter which party controls it) and the entrenched bureaucracy to move us anywhere, but for that reason we’ll be spared any big new agencies or spending programs (unlike when the previous Republican President had an R-majority Congress). That’s why I voted for him–first time in 14 presidential elections I didn’t vote third party.﻿

        citizens of the West are waking up.id say there is a big difference between a man of the west and a citizen of the west. I wonder if this term citizen of the west was purposely phrased this way by Mr shirei could , it’s possible , become a citizen of the east , with my blonde hair and blue eyes. But I’ll never be a “man of the east”.maybe I’m too rigid, and things could get better, but until this one race the human race is driven from yhe mind of every “man of the west” I don’t see a principled defense against our self genocide.
