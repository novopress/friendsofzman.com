        Yeah, all us (cultural) gringos were all chatting and helping out in our neighborhood, too.I’m most grounded in Latin culture.  My general impression is that it is pretty matriarchal under the machismo (ah, the fireworks between my matriarchal mom and patriarchal dad, who both thought that they were the one in charge).  So if the mujeres don’t know enough to tell the hombres to clear the snow, the snow won’t get cleared.  I’d qualify that by saying that like my great grandfather, a very large fraction of the hispanics you see are here to work for a few years, save some money, and buy a car or house back home.  They have nothing to gain by investing in the immediate community.Pretty much every Shia Arab I ran into would tell me that every Sunni Arab thinks that he is a prince of the desert.  My general impression was that you could get a Shia to work with his hands, but outside of the Bedouin, no Sunni was going to be seen dead toiling.I have a Hindu friend who’s a real convert – God, guns, and Reagan.  God bless him, but I’m still pretty sure that there’s never been a speck of dirt under that cat’s fingernails.  One afternoon, he needed some help with something that needed someone to get his hands dirty, so he came over to avail himself of my skills and tools, and brought his dad.  Turns out his old man was a very high muckety-muck on the sub-continent… just one notch below cabinet level.  After watching me fix stuff, he apparently had one of those crystal bullet to the forehead moments and blurts out to me, “Now I understand where Yankee ingenuity comes from.  You all have small workshops in your homes!”Last story, I promise.  I was working in an Asian capital and needed some tools.  I had noticed that stores tended to be clustered by goods sold.  There was a fabric district, and an appliance district,… you get the drift.  So I started asking the Asians at work where the hardware district was.  None of them knew and (being good Confucians) all of them seemed to be a bit uncomfortable answering.  Finally my wife found an expat friend who had an Asian general contractor doing some work on her place.  He was so stunned that a guy of my station wanted to buy tools that he wanted to meet me.I’m kind of a half-caste myself, but I’m with you.  I like the world where we all pitch in to help clear each others’ driveways after the plows come through.  I like the world where there is no shame in a grown, educated man doing manual labor.  I liked being a man in a world where being an athlete, scholar, and leader was honored.  I feel that world slipping away.  I want it to stop.

        Islam is the Acme of the lowest common denominator.It is why cultural marxism and islam fit together like hand and glove.Witnessing the cultural marxists deliberate importation of musloids into the west is looking right up into the bowels of the human extinction movement.Mr. Zman, you need guns and lots of ammo and a piece of land, work it, free your mind, leave it all behind, doubt, fear, disbelief. Live Free or Die.The countryside is where the cultural war will be fought hardest, the countryside is where the human extinction movement will be resisted and defeated. The cultural marxist can not exist without a countryside it can plunder from afar. It’s source of power hinges entirely on a concentrated mass of disaffected and divided people, the more diverse and divided the more power it retains. That kind of tyranny is not possible in the countryside. People have land, land free’s people from the trap of cultural marxism, land and guns and a hoe and a handful of seeds is the physical components of liberty, it is self determination. The greatest assault weapon against tyranny.

        Maybe it’s not just race. Maybe it’s also the generation. We used to live in NYC. When there was a lot of snow, my dad (who was born in 1950) was out there shoveling. So were the neighbors. Pretty much everyone in our neighborhood (us included) was from the West Indies.

            Probably a mix of both. You see far fewer young people out hustling money to shovel walks and driveways, but a community full of strangers is going to have less cooperation. Then there are some groups that are made for low trust societies.

            When I was younger, people cleared snow off the sidewalk in front of their homes, until one winter the word got round that if someone slipped on the sidewalk you had cleared, you could be hauled before the courts and sued. But if you left the snow then it was just weather  and thus no one could complain. It wasn’t the homeowner’s responsibility to clear up after Mother Nature.Very few people after that bothered to clear snow, which is a wonderful way of saying we were happy to work together for the general good until some smart arse lawyer decided there was money for him/her in laying blame, so we opted for no blame.

        The prospect of global warming suggested that everyone, regardless of race, colour or creed would be equally basking in the pleasant weather. As riots in the UK only happen when the weather is nice, we had that to look forward to if we had warmer  weather.But snow and ice… ah, now that is going to make for an interesting society now that the reality of global cooling is upon us. Muslims don’t particularly appreciate the snow and probably, when they rule Eurabia, there won’t be a lot of shovelling going on at all. Someone said recently that one of the issues in bringing in a boatload of muslims is that, for example, the dikes in Holland won’t get attended to. Once they collapse through lack of maintenance, the muslims — having only loyalty to whoever gives them freebies — will flee elsewhere. They have fled before so it is no big deal, and the Netherlands can be left to return to the sea.I can’t imagine that many of the immivasion enjoy winters in Norway and Sweden for that reason. Once whitey disappears there will only be unshovelled white stuff everywhere.

        That’s why i advocate tying any asylum, or permanent residence request, with the conversion away from islam to some flavor of Christianity, as a purely practical measure but also a gesture of good faith, and unlike an outright ban this could be actually sold to the public.Because let’s face it, people who don’t like bacon will never become productive members of western society, and we shouldn’t pretend otherwise!It’s funny watching schools banning Christmas all over the place here in Europe, while they are at the same time building muslim prayer rooms. Or Parma, Italy, taking in refugees who don’t likeprosciutto, sheer insanity, INSANITY.

        Upper caste Indians are  riotously funny in the gym, they have no native strength at all. Guys my size, but half my age are struggling when lifting 10 lb. dumbbells for curls and the naked bar for bench press. In fact, many use the fixed 30 lb. barbell for starting BP and struggle to do 3 sets of 10.
You really have to work at it to be that lacking in strength!

        “The small intrusion of Muslims” reads better and is more accurate as “The small invasion of Muslims”. And the Moslems are not concerned about snow removal because hey, if it’s Allah’s will that there is snow on their cars, well then why bother. They’re probably not working anyway, so have no place to go.If things continue as they are, there will one day be no higher ground to flee to. We are on the same road to perdition as Europe, only they are much further along. I pray that our country can alter our path before we find ourselves in the exact same boat. Europe is on the doorstep of war with the Mohammedans. Have the Europeans become too flabby in their post-Christendom to defend their culture, their heritage, their nations, their very lives? I’m afraid we are soon to find out.

            God watches out for drunks, babies, and the United States of America.  We’ll soon see if that still holds.

        This is NOT a happy picture that you have drawn.   All things being equal Islam will take over the world no matter which group balances the other group.  And even outside of their ghetto, the Muslims will rape and pillage the women of the other groups if their numbers are large enough on New Years Eve or the 4th of July…..
And about half of the world of over 7 billion will still blame the Jews who number about 10 million.  As I said, it is not a happy picture.
