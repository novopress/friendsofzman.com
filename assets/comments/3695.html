        Mossad does  assassinations. Their work is very meticulous and very covert, as opposed to this attack.

        I don’t accept “there’s a massive global conspiracy of Jews out to get Whitey” argument. But I do think Whitey is the conduit through which many victim groups (including Jews) deflect their anger. It is a cathartic and powerful (and oh-so-click-worthy) emotion. This century it’s all about Whitey. Some of us (myself included) are not on board with that.That is all.

        “The Israeli government is a rogue regime by most international standards, engaging as it does in torture, arbitrary imprisonment, and continued occupation of territories seized by its military.”Substitute United States for Israeli and every Progressive and most of the United Nations would agree with the revised statement as well as the original. To keep it simple, “birds of a feather flock together” somewhat describes our relationship with Israel. But then my I.Q. probably isn’t high enough to allow me to grasp the subtleties of Giraldi’s thesis.
