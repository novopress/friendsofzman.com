        From the ABSTRACT of an article that appeared in the Journal of Sec Research in 2008:  “This article is the first systematic review of the research literature on women’s rape fantasies. Current research indicates that between 31% and 57% of women have fantasies in which they are forced into sex against their will, and for 9% to 17% of women these are a frequent or favorite fantasy experience.”
That says it all.

        The sand is fast running out in Dunham’s fifteen-minute hourglass.  One can only hope that the media outlets red-light her antics before she demeans herself (and bores us) too much more.  Ten years from now, she’ll be hitting the daytime talk show circuit to crow about her recovery from her [fill in the blank] addiction.  One year further on, there will be a four or five line item in some obscure news feed documenting her return to rehab.

        Obvious delusion or baloney.  Who’d want any sort of sex with that hog? You’d have to use 2 x 4 scaffolding, ropes, and crampons to keep from falling into her gaping, steaming abyss. You’d have cooties and nightmares for months.
“Never thought I’d see the light of day again, boys.  Worst part was, Little Ned, the canary, went beak up 30 seconds in. Knew he was doomed.  Winked at me in that sad way of his, and chirped his last. Seemed to say, ‘Gonna miss you, Mel. Good times.’ That tubby bitch killed Little Ned!”

        “we are a nation of adult children so horrified by the prospect of actual children that we put one in five of them to death for such excellent reasons as the desire to fit nicely into a prom dress”Hmmm, there’s that 1 in 5 statistic again:  1 in 5 co-eds are (allegedly) subject to sexual assault at some point during their college days…and now 1 in 5 unborn babies are medically shredded in situ like so much cabbage.  Boy, that statistic sure gets overworked these days.  Is it because of the ever popular 80-20 rule?  I, myself, prefer the 90-10 rule.

        I’m not sure where I heard it first, it may have been here but whenever a chubby woman with short hair says anything – the opposite applies. I struggled for independence means I graduated in _______ Studies on Daddy’s dime. I don’t usually do this means I did it last night. I was raped means I regret I slept with a loser and the wrong sort of people started to hear about it.Men have allowed masculinity to become a sin and now women are allowing femininity to become a joke.I suspect that Lena Dunham is the kind of girl that isn’t into one-nighters but peer pressure made her think otherwise during college. She did it, felt uncomfortable and cognitive dissonance confused her precious feelings. Wait, no, no! That couldn’t have been it at all! Why, it was RAPE!A regular hoe just shrugs it off and is grateful she isn’t pregnant or diseased. A normal girl desperate to maintain her reputation can’t accept the responsibility of what happened and will point fingers and cry.

        The thing that strikes me about girlfriend Lena is she’s writing a memoir. What gems of wisdom has she acquired in her short, meaningless fat skanky life? I’ll pass.
