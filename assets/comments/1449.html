        More non-animal food can be produced with one unit of energy/cost than animal food. Agriculture is far more efficient than ranching and fishing. Eliminate agriculture and shift to ranching/dairy and then you will see people starve.

        How does shifting towards vegetarianism result in starvation? It is far more efficient to feed the world a vegetarian diet vs. an animal diet. We could feed mire people if we moved away from meat/dairy. Nobody should be eating meat three times a day.

            A vegetable diet is unhealthy. Humans evolved eating primarily meat, fish and wild edibles when available. It is farlessefficient to feed people vegetables than meat and it is impossible to feed the world using the phony-baloney “sustainable agriculture” preached by these nuts.
