        “humans constantly compare themselves to others around them as a form of self-evaluation. If everyone else thinks pink flamingos on the lawn is gauche, then you are unlikely to install them on your lawn. This applies to opinions, styles, religion, etc.”This is exactly what happened with acceptance of homosexuality. Due to dominance of the media, people were convinced that they were the only ones that were still disgusted by it, so they changed their opinions. Next was transsexuals. You could see it happen in real time, but by the time of the introduction of “Kaitlyn” Jenner, everyone knew what was expected, and tried to be the first one to defend “it” (Kaitlyn)

        You are correct. Most people will not change their minds because that requires some effort, such as simply understanding the issue because that requires work and using whatever cognitive powers they possess.
In Black Swan Nassim Taleb describes two conditions: 1) the narrative fallacy and 2) naive empiricism. The first involves tidy stories over truths, and the last (most importantly) the natural tendency to look for examples as evidence to confirm our theories. If the facts get in the way, so be it.

        “We’ve always been at war with Eastasia!” Thanks for the reminder, James B.The whole point of Zman’s post was most human beings, most of the time, don’t change their minds due to evidence. That was really at the heart of the piece, with global warming being an illustration of the principle.When I wrote “global warming” above, I really meant “climate change.” In fact, I’m certain that I never wrote “global warming.” Emmanuel Goldstein and those traitors in the Brotherhood must have altered my comment using some kind of illegal Eastasian software! Not that Eastasian software is superior to that coded by patriotic Oceaneans, whose hearts and minds have been liberated by Ingsoc, no sir!

        This is all I’m going to say about this load of crap. Instead of arguing that it’s “I think that’s at the heart of the Global Warming cult” Read it instead as “I think that’s at the heart of the Global Warming Denying cult.” Where all the evidence is summary dismiss because humans can’t possibly be effecting the weather. Because that is what this enter post boils down to.Here is a real easy way to prove that Global Warming Theory is baseless, use data, use facts. Don’t just declare it’s a cult and build a straw-man because you willfully disbelieve what the actual theory is and what the evidence is.

        I listen to the BBC World Service a lot.  They had a piece about some expedition that was studying the Arctic sea ice.  While conceding that the area covered by ice had grown in recent years, they were quite adamant that it was “thinner” than in the past.  You can’t make this stuff up.  Next thing they will be saying that it’s made out of ice that has a higher melting temperature or something (apologies to K. Vonnegut).To avoid the NOAA effect, I wonder if there is any way to introduce blind or double blind testing into this mess.  Send researchers out to measure the ice thickness but tell them that they are looking for evidence or particulate pollution in their ice cores.Abandoning a belief system is tough.  Starting with Saul/Paul, I think a lot of converts have likened it to getting hit by a bolt of lightning.9.8m/s^2?!?  Isn’t Systeme International a lunatic plot or something?

        Sorry. Here’s the missing link:http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/12/AR2007031200997.htmlFrostbite Ends Bancroft-Arnesen Trek“MINNEAPOLIS — A North Pole expedition meant to bring attention to global warming was called off after one of the explorers got frostbite. The explorers, Ann Bancroft and Liv Arnesen, on Saturday called off what was intended to be a 530-mile trek across the Arctic Ocean after Arnesen suffered frostbite in three of her toes, and extreme cold temperatures drained the batteries in some of their electronic equipment.“Ann said losing toes and going forward at all costs was never part of the journey,” said Ann Atwood, who helped organize the expedition….”

        …Does anyone still remember the two lunatic lesbian hikers who were going to walk to the North Pole, but instead got frostbite and nearly froze to death?They were expecting palm trees and parrots, I suppose, but got surprised.Try this on your average Climate Change/née Global Warming devotee:Ask them: For how long has the ‘glacier’ has been melting?Usually they’ll say 100 to 200 years, or simply refuse to answer.Then tell them it’s been melting for about 20,000 years.Long before fossil fuels, SUVs, and the industrial revolution.When they don’t believe you show them this little video of the Laurentide Ice Sheet:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbsURVgoRD0When they still don’t believe you send them to the government’s ownOak Ridge National Laboratory to get a the fully detailed maps of the glacial retreat:http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/nercNORTHAMERICA.htmlAsk them: What explains the first 19,800 years of melting?Believers will simply say ‘ the scientists all agree’,or just ignore what they’re seeing with their own eyes.In the end, the Zman is correct.It will all have no effect, no evidence will make any difference.Climate Change/née Global Warming is the new ‘One-True-Faith’.===================================================“Trust me, Wilbur. People are very gullible. They’ll believe anything they see in print.”― E.B. White, Charlotte’s Web“No one in this world, so far as I know—and I have searched the record for years, and employed agents to help me—has ever lost money by underestimating the intelligence of the great masses of the plain people.”― H.L. Mencken, Gist of MenckenThe disadvantage of men not knowing the past is that they do not know the present. History is a hill or high point of vantage, from which alone men see the town in which they live or the age in which they are living.G. K. Chesterton“W: Nobody’s so gullible as scientists. All the phony mediums say so.Can’t quite see why.J: Oh, yes, it would be so. They think they know, you see.That’s always dangerous.”― Agatha Christie, Destination Unknown…

        I am reminded of the story of the people who set out to prove the existence of global warming by swimming in the seas near the north pole. They were rescued suffering from frostbite, but undettered one of their supporters/apologists announced this was merely proof of how volatile the climate was because what should have been warm was inexplicably cold.
A good cult can explain away anything, and the warmologists have all the best explanations.

        2013 was especially hard for believers, to recap, they saw snow in Cairo Egypt for the first time in over 100 years, some famous scientist was trapped in heavy ice while trying to document it’s very same disappearance, several nuclear powered ice breakers couldn’t reach him, and on top of that, they recorded the coldest temperature ever on earth in Antarctica at -135.8F (-94.7C).I remember sending to some peoplethis picture of a confused camel sitting in snowand getting “yeah but still” replies back…To quoteRichard Fernandezagain:“Someone asked me whether years of freezing weather would dispel a belief in global warming. I said “no”. When people find out that the mother-ship doesn’t arrive on the scheduled date, they just wait some more.”
