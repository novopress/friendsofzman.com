        “The(US) press serves as the interpreter.”Really? I say…bunk.I’m fairly adept at Newspeak, I have a working relationship with pre-“usage” dictionary terms.“The Press” (can we call that media now?)serves as cautionary tale for how to lose refereed “Academic” debate club..by the old rules.The Press has become rent seeking Sophomores editing, then “judging” masters theses.“Rent seekers” comes to mind, but one wouldn’t see a term like that, used without mis-remembrance, or disingenuous “interpretation”, in a (ie)NYT Political Science propaganda column in “economics”, “social” justice, International affairs, or Academic “administration” clothing, would one. In fairness, when “the press”, ESPECIALLY electronic media,  produces at a (formerly) eighth grade public school comprehension level (ask ’em), to “inform” grown ups, then what average mental and emotional IQs are they catering to?Math is hard.DISCLOSURE: Intellectual snob agent provocateur.

            My view is the American media functions as the public relations arm of the Cult of Modern Liberalism. The small bits of heresy you find at Fox is met with screaming hysterics because it is so rare. Otherwise, the mainstream press is a wall of sound.
