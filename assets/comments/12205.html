        Good show, as usual, but I think you’re wrong about the purpose of weird capitalization, parentheses,  punctuation, etc. in the humanities. I’ve had a lot of experience with this crap, personally, and Alan Sokal was correct in diagnosing this “physics envy.” In short, it’s just a way for people with “no math” (as Derbyshire would say) to fill chalkboards with things that look intricate and complicated, and justify the inflated salaries and waste of money for the students (and their parents) involved in the whole charade.Look up “The Sokal Affair.” He trolled the hell out of these idiots. Actually, Z-Man, that gives me an idea: just as an experiment, write the dumbest, craziest, batshit essay about man-hating or race-hating from a feminist or black studies perspective under an assumed name and submit it to a journal. If they fall for it, rub it in their faces and mount their scalp on your tentpole.

        The drug war has never been fought, really. The war on drugs is about posturing where politicians can say ‘Don’t get mad at me!!! We’re fighting drugs and the social consequences of them!!!! Lookit!!! Laws!!! Arrests!!!”And the degenerates that sell and abuse them are back on the street as fast as the cops take them off. It’s a sham.To my knowledge the drug war is only being fought by Mohammed and his buddies – they behead users and abusers in public… and that guy, whatshisname – Duterte? In the Phillipines? The guy that called Obama a son of a whore in public? He’s sending death squads around to dispose of users and dealers. Their problems with drugs is on the decline, obviously.We have too much money, and too much affluence if people spend hard earned money on this dreck. I suspect ultimately, the cops and authorities will ease us into being comfortable with the idea of druggies dying on the streets and getting shot by angry home owners defending themselves and their property – because the gubbimint sure as hell won’t do it.On the plus side, that will be a kick in the balls to the anti-gun lobby.

            Drug dealers are day labor- paid in cash- for politicals.
Modern drug trade is revolutionary in it’s scope; no one imagined  a small political racket would grow to rule the world- but it wasn’t created by the Cloud because they love us Dirts.

            I’m here to help. I lost the link, but I’ve added the intro to an article that really helped me get clear in my mind why being a normal guy is worse than Hitler: It’s from the ‘Digest of Oppression Studies’.WHITE PENIS, PAN-GENOCIDE: Reflections toward a politics of geno-systemic ‘othering’ as ‘hidden directional text’…Abstract:In this auto-generative excursion into what Jalavi-hal Molammbi[1] has incisively termed “cis-gendered templates of ‘Straussian cryto-phallic modes of para-elliptical discourse.&#x27;”, the authorx – borrowing humbly from the path-finding methodologies of Gerta Himmelfarb and her colleagues in their classic 1997 article “Non-‘normative’ pseudo-queering: ‘Onanism’ as anti-patriarchal social ‘text&#x27;” – examines the nondiscursive and largely unverbalized suzerainty of (to adopt the language of Mia Profumo[2]) “the erect white penis”.In this essay the authorex examines – through interviews, self-examination, scraps of poetry, random quotes from the 1962 Encyclopedia Briitannica, and scientific forays into Pornhub (the free stuff only) – the relations between, on one hand, patriarchy, capitalism, race and gender; and on the other, genocide, alienation of “the “other”, white male tumescence and its rule over the oppressed peoples of “color”.I hope this helps.

        First! BTW there’s no link to the pod’ in your sidebar…I mean to this:http://thezman.com/wordpress/?cat=38
Maybe add “podcast” right to “My Theory of Everything”:
HomeContactEssential KnowledgeMokitaMy Theory of EverythingPodcast
Or somewhere, because currently it’s not evident to a newcomer that you even have a podcast, you have to search for it by hand.

            Yeah, that’s a good idea. I’m going to re-organize the links this month. I want to add a drop down menu to clean up the side bar and make the text area a bit bigger. I’ll add a podcast menu too.

        Instead of smack, we have an opioid addiction problem. I would also include food in with that too – obesity is 40% AND CLIMBING. There’s going to be a number of addicts out there, public policy should be how do we make as many of them functional addicts as possible? How do we put the fun in functional?
I would argue that some drugs make for better functional addicts than others, and once someone with an addictive personality is identified, they should be encouraged to do some drugs over others.

            You should flee to an African haven, preferably one without the taint of white colonialism (liberated from the shackles of racist vestiges like paved roads, sanitation, electricity) and steeped in proud African customs such as raping infants to cure AIDS or consuming human flesh to gain the power of your opponent. And the best part is, if you start to miss the institution of slavery, even though whites abolished it of their own volition a long time ago, sub-Saharan Africans are still big into human trafficking and will probably return to their old customs with a vengeance if whites stop exercising their supremacy through things like foreign aid, Christian charity, and human rights groups. Your future’s so bright you’re gonna have to wear shades.
