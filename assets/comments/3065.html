        One variable with Hispanics is the evangelicals. There are a lot of Pentecostal and Charismatic Hispanic Christians who don’t buy into the liberal death culture. I think the same is starting to trend upward with blacks.The old black Church folks identify with the Civil Rights movement but there are younger black Christians who are more Biblically and family oriented.

        Most Latinos self-identify as “white” in the Census.  Most of my Mexican friends (I grew up in So Cal) whose ancestors came here before the borders were opened, are pretty darn conservative.  At one point I worked with all of the female (they are all female, BTW), Mexican Congress People from So Cal.  They are all Labor Democrats with strong union backing… the new Irish as you point out.  If like the Irish after WWII, we could just get them to value education as much as they value working with their hands, they’ll do OK.
