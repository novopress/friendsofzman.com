        ‘Kto Eto’? One of the most astute political observations of the modern world. (my understanding of the translation means ‘from whom to whom’?) My life has been directed to answer; Not from me and not to thee. I think this is one of the best ‘think pieces’ the Z man has produced.’Who’ is a fundamental question that must be answered to move forward

        it feels like there is rarely a third way articulated to “what is an american” type arguments. Conservatives tend to bring up american exceptionalism and talk about america like they are a tour guide at the atlantis resort. Leftists tend to simply want to find as many flaws in the country as possible. But I feel there is no “neither” way that rejects both arguments.It kind of makes me wonder how long this sort of “america: the tour guide” mentality , as perfected by someone like Dinesh D’Souza, has existed. Here is a song that came out in the waning days of the kennedy administration:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWrCRPldVZkperhaps we were always destined to become an international shopping mall. Because the lyrics to that song offers no defense against that happening.

            Granted I’m not real up on the cesspool known as pop music these days, but I think it’s been a good quarter century now since the last time anybody recorded a song with that message. I’m thinking Brooks and Dunn or Toby Keith. But even the Nashville crowd stopped pretending a while ago.

                I tuned out of pop music and the pop “culture” in March of ’92 at the age of 24. Those blessedly rare instances when the pop culture is imposed upon me from without only serve to confirm the wisdom of my decision some 32 years ago.

        Off Topic (The immediate topic, that is)
Looks like Michael Anton is still reading the Z-Man Blog, or at least ruminating about his recent clashes with our host.  However they might disagree, Anton seems to be edging over toward a partial agreement on current conditions and the looming reality we face …..

            PrimiPilus:  He’s still straddling the sharp edge between Conservatism, Inc. and the dissident right.  Yes, one can definitely detect signs of awareness in his writing (the anti-White hate, the sexual degeneracy, the opioid crisis), but he’s appealing for some sort of moderate populism from the right-branch of the uniparty’s ‘thinkers.’  If Anton isn’t careful and picks up too many more ideas from the evil notsees who comment here, he will find himself cast out into the howlering wilderness of the dissident, without quite knowing how he got there.

                They are all cast out. They are just pretending like they are not. Anton believes what we believe. He just hasn’t been forced to act like it yet. But he will be. But when that day comes he’ll have a legitimacy problem and for the young bangers who are the powerhouses and future of the DR he’ll be way in the back of the line.

                A guy like Anton has probably gone as far as he can.Any further would involve admitting that he believed and lived a lie.  Very few people are capable of doing so, especially in a short time frame.  There’s no point in attacking him for that failure.  Especially as he can help move others along the path, who aren’t as invested in the lie as he is.

                Agree. I’m thinking he can see over the barrier into the “hellscape” beyond, but that he’s scared of what he sees, and scared of what that means for his future (political, social and publishing) life. I sense in following his writings that he wants so desperately for the whole American Project to work. I confess: I do too. But almost like some tragic Ancient Greek prophetess he sees the horror that’s coming (has arrived).Anyway, perhaps I project ….For another view of the corruption and it’s madness, wander over to:westernstatescenter.orgReminds me of the Maenads …. crazies following Dionysus. Portland, of course, but I’m sure these organizations and non-profits are littered everywhere across the American landscape now. Our overburden of dangerous, committed lunatics seems to have exceeded critical mass a long time ago.

        It’s early on a cold, winters Saturday morning, and I’d like to give all of the posters on this blog a hearty “Thank You” for the razor sharp comments on this particular post. I haven’t laughed so hard in a long time. I confess, I don’t read many other blogs/sites, but this one, for me, is far and away the best. Both in content and comments.“Francis sliced pork belly”?When I originally read that, it made no sense.Then I read it again…..nuthin.Then it hit me. I couldn’t stop laughing!Call me hopelessly obtuse, but I’m going to blame it on being up at 4:00 shoveling a country lane and cleaning off cars.God bless you all (yes, I said it), and have a great new year.

        If you are wondering why currently the local weatherperson seems to get the weather report wrong, see below. It’s apparently too difficult because all the competent people are attending DEI meetings. These are all the departments and agendas and recordkeepings required to predict the friggin weather FFS-(for the last few days they have predicted blizzards, and 5 inches of snow, and below freezing, but as I look out my window, it’s above freezing, sunny and calm.

            I can report that at several of the Bay-area high-tech clients with whom I work it is now more important to be involved with DEI initiatives than it is to do any actual work at your job. Everyone at these companies knows that if you want to advance in the company, you must be seen as actively involved with DEI programs. Consequently, many of them are basically outsourcing their jobs so they can spend their time on DEI committees, programs, etc.
The good news is that I have never been busier.

            Sadly, I am way behind in my reading, working laboriously through Leckie’s ‘History of European Morals’, while Mr Krinkle’s ‘Space Raptor Butt Invasion’ (which I bought on-line thinking it was a Butthole Surfers’ live album) slumbers in the “must read” pile. Shame on those scolds at the TLA for traumatizing him in this disgraceful manner! He’s a martyr to his art.EDIT – sorry, Mr Tingle. For some reason I was thinking about Primus, don’t know why.

        Asking the question, “Who says so?” either has a valid answer or it does not. If it has no correct answer, that’s indistinguishable from some strains of anarchy, most closely, anarcho-capitalism.But if there is a correct answer, that becomes the moral authority for whatever social order one wants to erect. Which is either some form of authoritarianism, or, if based on some consensus, is pretty much the same as a rights-based society. People agree to act as if rights exist, at least those rights the consensus wants, and to punish those who don’t comply.So if your answer isn’t just a blanket, “You’re not the boss of me!”, how is that functionally different than a worldview in which rights actually did exist?

            “Who says?” would always have a valid answer.The question and it’s ilk go back many years to recover the “deleted performative.”  It exposes statements made by someone where they attempt to pass off their judgment by masking it in a universality. Example:  You can’t where white after labor day.  Who says? Well, everybody knows that.  Everybody?  And so forth, it exposes a belief to just be of the speaker.When one buys a house, they aren’t buying the house.   They are buying property. Property is defined as a bundle of rights. One buys the right to occupy and utilize a particularly chuck of land.  One buys the right to exclude others from that chunk of land. The buyer gets the rights from the seller, and so forth all the way back to a/the sovereign.  In a dispute it is a judge who says.  A judge can send out a sheriff and umpteen deputies to make acts correspond to his words.    And they can call for backup all the way to the Pentagon.

        The part of the American right that’s willing to do “who” thought is pretty bad at it, maybe for lack of practice.Example of the week: The few who aren’t stuck on the sewer Jews are talking about the military’s inability to attract new white male blood. The obvious true thing, that people rarely join an enemy army, is being said (though not so plainly). But also a stupidly untrue “who” idea is gaining ground: The un-whitening of the US military makes it more likely to turn its guns on the American people; white men’s refusal is *accelerating* the military’s shift from empire/outward to police/inward.The darkening of the forces may in fact be happening because our rulers think that the “blacks and browns” and tranny psychos etc will be happy to kill us. Indeed they will. But the show is superfluous. There is not one straight white Southern Christian military-family man in any service who’d refuse an order to shoot you in the face for having Z’s podcast on your phone. And any white boy currently avoiding a military career because the army’s “woke” or gay or anti-white who gets convinced to sign up so he can resist from within or get free training for SHTF Day or whatever—he’ll smile while he kills you too.How many white men were cashiered for refusing to stand at the razor wire in DC and aim their rifles out at the people while Biden was “installed?” None. Because *military* is a stronger “who” than *white* or *American*—or any race or country.

            Hemid:  Many, many military guys – active and former, tradcons and patriots – seem to have a particularly difficult time accepting racial reality.  More specifically, racial averages.  Yeah, they may have dealt with the standard hostile and stupid American jogger, but they will also have that one special sergeant or buddy, their IKAGO.  They somehow don’t seem to notice the heavy gang presence among the ranks, but “Hector” or “Juan” were top-notch warriors.They still seem to think that they’re part of a ‘brotherhood’ that somehow transcends racial differences.  I’m afraid that, like all the churchians and cuckservatives, they’re going to have to learn the hard way that your skin color is the only uniform that will matter when our troubles erupt.

        Somewhat related, the American Conservative has a review of “The Rise of Christianity: A Sociologist Reconsiders History” by Rodney Stark. Stark argues that Christianity among the Romans did not arise from the top, or the bottom, but the upper classes. Those most literate. And that it won out in part by what amounts to its massive patronage network especially amongst its own, but that could be entered by outsiders. Christianity not being limited by ethnicity or family ties. And that its far greater fertility led also led to the upper classes rapidly becoming Christian hence the dependent lower classes and the elite rulers depending on their courts.What strikes me in the religion of Woke is that while there is a place for various women of color, and God save us, Upper Class White War Karens, there is no place for White men. Not in leadership, power, ambition, or anything. And unlike Christianity which did NOT challenge temporal authority or non-religious tradition but embraced both, Woke religion requires of ordinary people to hate themselves, their ancestors, and everything about their civilization while handing over everything to outsiders. Be they dudes scurrying out of tunnels or shouting Aloha Snackbar. [Sweden’s military has warned civilians to “prepare for War.” Whatever that means]The turmoil in the West is that Woke War Karens are on a crusade to impose Woke on everyone and everything, and like a bowl of turds people just won’t eat it up. It does not scale beyond the Real Housewives of Malibu or the Hamptons. In fact it anti-scales and the Regime is in thrall to the Real Housewives of Malibu.

            This.As I’ve said prior, your #1 problem ain’t Joos crawling out of sewers or feral blacks, your problem is your own daughters — empowered to the max over the past century — who are making Total War on masculinity, fatherhood, family, God, and anything else that is good and supports healthy civilization.All while assuring one another constantly that they are Oppressed and Abused and Held Down by the (nonexistent) patriarchy.  By FAR, women are the best organized and most numerous tribal-power in the West.  What the Joos and blacks have is trivial in comparisonTens-of-millions of Daughter Daddies and their princesses are your problem.  Solve that, and 90% of your societal troubles vanish quickly.Keep denying it and the nation will fall, and soon.  It will be very, very painful.No matter if Daddy is a ‘conservative’ or a ‘Christian’, he is gonna sell God and nation (not to mention white males) down the river in service of his princess and the gynocracy, which pours out financial and other benefits upon daughter and daddy both.

                    Yes this is the standard response from daughter daddies.  Especially the ‘conservatives’ and ‘Christians’.MINE aren’t like that!  lolIf your daughter is humble, shamefaced, and obedient towards men, then you are in a very, very rare category.   I hope for your sake that you are not pretending otherwise.Your presumed rarity does not disprove the rule.  And the rule still rules over you.  And heaven does not like it, in a big way.‘But I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.’  (1 Cor. 11:3)God leaves no question concerning the proper place of females in this world.  With rare exception, American dads of daughters are in rebellion against Him.  To say nothing of the nation itself.

        Any time some progressive proclaims they want to serve their fellow man, I’m thinking “it’s a cookbook!!!!”It is impossible in my view to not notice one the major defining features of progressives.  They are always people who love humanity and hate everyone they know.  What they love is the idea of “humanity” and not people as they are.  That’s why the more progressive someone is, the less “diversity” you will find in their neighborhood.  They love the idea of a minority and an idealized version of that minority, not actual living human beings.  They know the people around them and don’t like them, because they hate everyone.   Real life people remind them of everything they don’t like about people.  At the root of every progressive is a deeply damaged person.

            Tars Tarkas: “Progressives… are always people who love humanity and hate everyone they know… At the root of every progressive is a deeply damaged person.”==========Lately I’ve come to think of Passive Aggressive Personality Disorder as being something of a Meta-Personality, wherein the various owners of such personalities choose to enter into a symbiosis of an herd [or an hive] of like-minded personalities.I doubt that the Passive Aggressives are consciously aware of any of this, but clearly their mid- to hind-brains have evolved to expect bountiful succor to be provided as the reward for their submission to the hive [or to the herd], and as powerful as this Meta-Personality has become [cf the so-called “Deep State”, or Z’s “Mangerialism”, or Anonymous Conservative’s “Cabal”, or what I call the “Passive Aggressive Industrial Complex”], as powerful as this Meta-Personality has become, it’s obvious that allowing themselves to be subsumed into the Meta-Personality has been a phenomenally successful evolutionary strategy for the Passive Aggressives  [even though they’re highly unlikely to be fully consciously aware of any of this].My point is that when you declare such a personality to belong to a “deeply damaged person”, I would reply that these “deeply damaged persons” now effectively rule the entire world.At least for the moment.At least until the Active-Aggressive peasants, with the pitchforks &amp; the torches, decide to take matters into their own hands.[Although, for the time being, nothing will change, so long as the peasants remain hesitant, apprehensive, filled with trepidation about the prospect of having to face off against the pension-sucking traitors of the Praetorian Guard.]==========PS: The longer I ponder the sociological topology of Passive Aggression, the more I sense nothing but a frigging insect colony.Which, of course, is precisely what those j00z looked like when they were crawling up out of the Brooklyn tunnels.Cockroaches.Termites.Leeches.Serpents.

            Lefties hate things as they are, obviously. A primary example: Veganism. That our species has lived primarily on animal products since like forever is unacceptable! By extension, any animal that eats another animal is morally debased in the eyes of Gaia (or Gaius, if Nature’s overseer identifies as male.) Without animal-derived nutrients, a hungry organism eyes plants, as if they don’t have lives to live too. What the fuck? Isn’t this hegemonic phlyumism? Where do we so-called ‘animal life-forms’ get off exploiting and – worse – effectively colonializing plants, just because they can’t run or defend themselves? It’s a serious question and I would be delighted to listen to a vegan explain xir raw biological imperialism…If these fuckers could figure out how to convince undergraduates that gravity, sunlight, oxygen etc. are mere “cis-hegemonic constructs” they surely would. Hell, Alan Sokol punked them in 1985 with his “deconstruction” of gravity in (I recall) ‘Social Text.’ When he revealed his ruse, that should have ended both ‘Social Text’ and every other preposterous and tree-destroying ‘journal’ of Xirl science. But no; instead Sokol was read the riot act for exposing his “learned colleagues” as frauds and idiots. The university presses kept rolling out volume after volume of this rubbish and here we are.

        Z – are you familiar with the internet personality Auron MacIntyre? He’s maybe the only interesting person on the blaze. It would be cool if he invited you for a conversation. Of course that’s his decision to make but I feel he probably secretly reads this blog since he sometimes echoes your talking points.

            That is a really low bar.  He’s one of those people who will walk up to a line and then pretend that that line isn’t there and that he’s on the far-right of “noticing.”
I don’t think he is an enemy, but he is not us and I have serious doubts he would interview such a bad-thinker like Z.

                My Impression is that he is a part of a funnel and network who are on the DR. His role is to deliver the ideas and stay uncancelled.I have seen him on many interviews and he has a skill that many lack – the ability to answer questions and speak truths that says everything to the people in the know and gives no ammunition to our enemies. We are not going to get anywhere or be taken seriouslyIf everyone who doesn’t say everything you want them to say is just a gatekeeper, there will never be anything but gatekeepers.Shapiro and Peterson and Rubin … … are gatekeepers. Shapiro is intentionally so. He is a foreign agent who has openly admitted his role. This society is so corrupt and so hopeless he can do it and get away with it. Peterson is part mentally ill and part deluded that his role in life is to never permit another Hitler or Stalin to arise. The cherry on top is how much money he makes to promote HBD for his paymasters but absolutely renounce his own people and take the side of Hamza Yusef who wants to annihilate them in their own homelands. Rubin is just a middling at best mind who thinks he is so cool because he just figured out he is a libertarian, but is too dumb to ever figure out that he is every bit a Leftist as the those who he left on the Left.As best as I can tell, MacIntyre is a legitimate dissident who is smart enough to keep private matters where they belong.

            Auron MacIntyre is a Civ Nat gatekeeper like a Jordan Peterson. He notices a lot of the bigger false narratives but wants to always assure his audience that he isn’t a racist or anti semite and condemns, absolutely condemns, racism and anti Semitism.
Auron McIntyre is another one of those instant social media celebrities who came out of nowhere and instantaneously became a thing. Like a goy Lex Friedman. I wonder who sponsors him

            “When I saw the video of the guys coming out of the tunnels, I thought who are these assholes?”
I thought it was hilarious. The videos of the fights, bench overturnings and the arrests of those weird guys was absurd, surreal and one of the funniest things I’ve seen lately. It’s something Benny Hill, the Marx Brothers and Franz Kafka could have collaborated to stage.
These people need to be laughed out of the country.

        Is that the sound of booted footsteps echoing down an empty hall? Yes, I believe it is!2038. April. A squad of police tasked with the “Normalization Order Policing Equipment” (NOPE) marches into a high school. Their automatic taser gatlings are held high. Each taser gatling fires twelve strings of electrical jolts in an S-pattern that fans out into space. NOPE is gunning for deviant teens who have made fun of transgender people. Their facial recognition software identifies correctly the first wrong-thinking teen. They drop to their knees, guns up. The teen tries to rise his hands. They fire . . .And later, at the roundup camps, as they’re called:Music blares from loudspeakers. It is “Red Sector A” by Rush. Confused and weary men and women are staggering from place to place, hurrying to get to their next lecture in a neverending series. Today’s first lecture: “It’s good to be a girl, but I was first a boy.”[To read more Greg Nikolic stuff, click on my name up above]

        “Transgenderism is the logical endpoint of universalism, which strips the who from the moral debate.”
You’re thinking too much like a normal person.  I doubt we are even 1/2 way through the list of misfits and weirdos we’ll have to worship in the end.  There’s pedophiles, junkies and furries yet to come.  Those are just some easy ones that spring to mind.

                But does this switch matter?Think about it.  What was the old saw wrt individually owned vehicles?  They were wasteful polluters.  Public transport was the key back then.  Of course folks would not give up their freedom to travel in personal vehicles, so public transport never took off in most cities, except possibly some of the biggest and  densest—and then never in the “burb’s”.Along comes EV vehicles and subsequent push to remove ICE powered vehicles.  Lots of new laws making ownership and affordability all but impossible, but hey you still have your right of free travel in your (personal) EV.  Win-win for environmentalists and Joe Normie.Now  that EV’s—the camel’s nose in the tent—is dying, do you think the Leftists care?  Not a whit.  They got what they wanted, a demonization of ICE vehicles—including laws against such even being bought, much less fueled.  If the EV’s don’t meet your needs, to bad—use public transport.  If public transport is lacking of limited, move back to the cities!And that’s just where they want you—in large “mega-cities” where you can be housed and controlled by the elites.  These are the cities where they already attempt to limit your travel within (see 15 minute cities).

                    Lost in all this is just how inefficient buses are.  So long as anyone has a choice, buses will be less efficient than cars because not enough people will ride them.Buses and trolleys worked in the early 20th century because that was the only real way to get around and so everyone used them. Only a full bus is efficient and profitable.  Worse, bus lines today have social justice reasons for existing. There are many bus lines that don’t make money even during rush hour and probably burn more energy than if everyone who used them were driving a car. But the neighborhood is a “poor” and “under-served minority neighborhood” and needs community services.

                        Bingo!  Here’s the current tale of public bus transport in Tucson.During the Covid Scamdemic, the City Council removed bus fairs.  All rides free.  Not sure what the thinking was in relation to Covid, but I don’t have the wisdom of a politician….After the scamdemic was over, the Council decided in their wisdom, that free public transport was a good idea for Mother Gaia so they continued the idea of no fare ridership.What happened?  Ridership is down, bus drivers are screaming bloody murder, and reports of crime (on the bus of course) is up—waay up.Seems the ones who now most use our city bus transport are street people, crazies, and bums who take drugs, fight, intimidate, and when not doing drugs defecate on the bus seats. Calls for Narcan have become common.Business owners are up in arms if anywhere near a bus stop, whereas heretofore such a business location was a plus!  Residents complain of “urban campers” in remote areas once devoid of such, but close to a bus line route.  Even down the road from my home (1/2 mile) a homeless encampment sprang up.  Luckily for us, the property owners took action and razed the area.  The area is now devoid of bums, but also vegetation we once had for the dogs walk in.The latest suggestion/remedy is to issue monthly “passes” for free in the hopes that the worse of the ridership will be too lazy—or high—to take the time to renew such passes.  We shall see.Luckily, I still possess “private” transport.  Nonetheless, there was a time as a grad student when I road the bus across town to university.  In those days, public transport was a lifeline for the poor, disabled, and infirm.  I got to see this for myself directly and have been ever since—and still—a supporter of public transport precisely for these types of resident.Leftists just turn everything to shit!

        These are deeply weird people who are both happy to take from us and also do not want anything to do with us. Maybe ten years ago I heard on NPR – NPR! – about what happened when Hasidim in upstate NY took control of a local school system. They took the tax money and instituted policies that said the goyim cattle and their children were no longer welcome here and would not be taught according to both American norms and the curriculum of New York. I would imagine most of the goyim sold their houses (to guess who, at guess what levels of profit) and got out. There has been a low-grade war for decades between the NYC DOE and the Hasidim over the fact that their children go to schools and don’t get anything even resembling a proper education. The NYC DOE scrutinizes, the Jewish leadership goes and talks to City Hall, the scrutiny dies. They are extremely poor, insular, and unlike other insular groups like the Amish, on welfare and happy to rip off government programs to their own benefit.I know Jews – religious, practicing Jews – who keep their distance from the Hasidim. The tensions between the ultra-Orthodox and the rest of the populace in Israel is well-known. Considering the media has reported on this regularly, it speaks of a turf war of sorts between various Jewish factions. Normally, I really have no interest in any of that, but somehow they all seem to try to make it my business. We know that Chabad are operating at the highest levels of influence in the government. The new leader of Argentina is a “based rightwinger” who visited Chabad HQ when those tunnels were in full operation. The only question I have is the same as Z – why are these people in my country and why are they making it better with their presence? I don’t see it. I don’t hate these people, they have the right to live the way they want to live, I just don’t see why we have to deal with this.

            The Hasidim are tolerated by other Jews because of their fecundity. They generally have 5 or more children, half of whom become secular and replenish the ranks of the less fertile majority. They are literally the breeding stock, and also insure that the majority does not stray too far from Talmudism.

                I think it is simpler as that. They’re all Jews. A wealthy Jew who lives in the Upper East Side and works as a lawyer or doctor is never going to go to Williamsburg and hang out with the Hasidim there, but they’re all Jews. Other ethnic/racial/whatever groups exhibit this exact same behavior. This is what in-group preference looks like, something that most European-descended people abandoned generations ago. David French would rather go halfway around the world to adopt a kid from Africa than he would to help out his neighbors, but it is important to emphasize that this is not normal behavior.

            In AINO, the freakier, more bizarre and more dysfunctional, the better. The University of Miami has a basketball player named Wooga Poplar. Wooga Poplar. Anybody with a name like that should be expelled from the country based upon the name alone. It is a signifier of primitive savagery that is entirely incompatible with white civilization and should not be tolerated. But no. The more a person departs from white norms, the more welcome and celebrated it is. The valorization of psychological dysfunction and subhuman culture is just part of the war against whites and our civilization.

                Interesting.  White parents have made a fetish out of unorthodox spellings for their children’s names – all hard c’s must become k’s, most vowels are turned into y’s; thus you get Kadynce and Kamryn.  I assumed it was an effort to signal that their little sprogs are special but maybe they too are trying to deny the essence of their white, European past.

            Well, if I had the choice between sending my kids to a Hasidic school where they’d learn a fully literate, genuinely religious, and also rigorously intellectual tradition (the Talmud–why do you think there are so many Jewish lawyers?) and sending them to one of those “normal” public schools that NPR just loves where they’d learn that Heather has two mommies and Ronald is actually Rhonda (plus “creative spelling” and “Everyday Math” where you have to take six steps and draw a diagram to do long division), I’d pick the former any day. People are always complaining that kids at evangelical Christian schools learn nothing but the King James Bible. What’s wrong with that? You learn how to write beautiful cadenced English plus everything about one of the major pillars of Western civilization.Now for the Jews ‘n’ tunnels that have you Z-people at fever level. There was just one tunnel. One. There were nine Jews arrested for getting into a fight with the police. Nine. Apparently there was some sort of internecine feud between two rival Hasidic factions over who had rights to the synagogue. So one group decided to build an underground tunnel to secure its access. That was, of course, illegal because it threatened building foundations and pedestrians walking above ground. So, hence, a scuffle with the cops. That’s it.I’m no fan of Hasidim–I think they look weird, and why don’t they have to work for a living like other Orthodox Jews? But you know? Our country is a country of weirdos. It was founded by weirdos. The “pilgrims” of Plymouth Rock whom we laud every Thanksgiving were some of the biggest weirdos of all, so weird that even the Puritans, themselves pretty weird, couldn’t stand them, and they had to flee to the Netherlands before they came over here on the Mayflower. And you need only read a history of colonial New England (or the stories of Nathaniel Hawthorne) to see what a pinball machine of bizarre religious dissidents that place was. And we’ve been spawning strange homegrown religions ever since.

[Or, judging by the apparent age in the photograph, that she has mischling grandchildren via a mμdsh@rking daughter.]

                        No mischling children or grandchildren here. My husband is an English-Scottish-Welsh combo. My own father, however, although Scottish-Irish, grew up in the South Bronx when it was heavily Jewish and went to CCNY when it was nearly 100 percent Jewish. So he was perhaps an honorary Jew.

Well we certainly don’t kidnap little children, torture them to maximize the Adrenochrome content in their blood, and then slit them &amp; drain them &amp; drink them in satanic religious ceremonies.

                I wish that you could send your kids to a Hasidic school because they would eventually educate you on the reality of racial tribalism.
You imagine that you can form bonds with the people of that community over shared values like a “fully literate, genuinely religious, and also rigorously intellectual tradition.”  Your kids would learn that there are tribal loyalties that override all such shared values.

                    I wouldn’t be trying to “form bonds”–or make my kids “form bonds”–with anyone by sending them to a Hasidic school. I’d be assuring myself that they’d actually learn something. If the other students, or the teachers, started mistreating my kids, I’d pull them out and send them to the Mandarin immersion school. Or homeschool them.

                        Charlotte Allen:  They wouldn’t learn a thing, you stupid old biddy, because they wouldn’t be allowed in the door!  The Hasids would SPIT on them as unclean.  They wouldn’t touch them, they wouldn’t eat with them.  And your kids would learn nothing because all they do is study their Babylonian Talmud in the German/Russian/Hebrew dialect known as YIDDISH.Get off your high horse, you insular insufferable knut, and try living in the real world for once.  I would pity your progeny except they’re undoubtedly equally ignorant and smug  virtue signallers who insist that all people are identical and interchangeable – except the Hasids, of course, who are Better than evil White Nationalists.

I’d be assuring myself that they’d actually learn something.”Yeah, they’d be learning that they are the “Chosen People of God” and are superior to shiksas like you. And superior to everyone else.And they’d be learning that their god instructs them to kill those inferior goyim so that they can have their Promised Land.Their religion worships killing their enemies. Passover and Purim celebrate killing their enemies. 1 Samuel 15:3 instructs them to “slay Amalek and spare them not, but kill man and woman, infant and suckling.” You know, exactly what Bibi cited when he started blasting Gazan children to smithereens.They’d be “learning something,” all right.

The only way to respond to someone like this is with mockery.I considered rebutting every logical fallacy and unfounded assumption she presents as her argument, and then reminded myself not to waste my time.  She would deny any assumptions at all, other than those of any ‘moral’ or “decent” person.  Your very worldview is immoral to her so your arguments automatically are without merit.She undoubtedly did a search to see what evil notsees had dared to notice the “who” in the tunnel story, and came here to moralize to the heathens.  Please, please do not waste a word on her.  That is the entire point of Zman’s (overlong) podcast – the essence of all of our arguments and assumptions are, or ought to be about WHO someone is.Get the right people, and almost any system or process will work.  That’s why I mock people when they start posting comments about precisely how they’ll limit the franchise, as though that will solve all the problems.

                This has to be the most asinine post i’ve ever read on this forum. They don’t want your goy cattle kids at their Yeshiva, Charlotte. They want to use your money to fund it, yes, and they want to impoverish your kid’s school and reduce your city’s service so they pay less taxes. They also want to make sure that more of your tax dollars go to their welfare, until the situation becomes untenable and you move. The places aren’t turning out SCOTUS justices, anyway. For the most part, the postwar class of Jewish elites came from mainly public high schools in places like Brooklyn (James Madison High, for example). And those elites did not send their kids to Yeshivas to learn in a “fully literate, genuinely religious, and also rigorously intellectual tradition” (LOL!). The Yeshivas don’t really teach much beyond the Talmud, in Hebrew. The kids are not educated, the families are large and very poor, they are on welfare and stick to themselves.

                    The grandparents of that postwar “Supreme Court” secular-Jewish generation–Philip Roth, Ruth Bader Ginsburg as examples–knew only Hebrew-school and yeshiva education, which focused on disputation and distinction-drawing as exemplified in a millennia and a half of rabbinic commentary on the Talmud, a document of late antiquity. Such mental activity sharpens the mind considerably. (Catholic immigrants drew on a similar intellectual tradition based on scholastic philosophy, which also focused on drawing fine distinctions and building arguments–hence, ultimately, the disproportionate number of Catholics on the current Supreme Court. It was no accident that Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia were best friends.) A culture that places such a high value on mental activity shapes even its lowliest, less gifted, and less educated members; you can see that with the Chinese, where the ancient imperial examination created a culture of ferocious test-prep and tiger parenting that persists even to this day.Not surprisingly the pushcart-Jewish immigrants whose sole education was probably the yeshiva enrolled their children in public schools–because the schools were not only free but of extremely high quality, especially the elite, rigorous, college prep-oriented high schools that required entrance exams and flourished in every American city before affirmative action and wokeness diluted their quality. Now–send your kid to public school, and it’s a steady diet of 1619 Project and My Princess Boy. Taught by teachers who are mostly semi-literate themselves.So what I’m saying is that if my kids’ alternative to the above were having to learn about what some 13th-century rabbis had to say about a 6th-century rabbi’s commentary on the Book of Genesis, I’d take the latter. My kids would imbibe a long intellectual tradition and also learn something about debating. And they’d pick up a foreign language, Hebrew. Sure, they might miss out on math, but I could send them to math camp for that.

                        Read the comments again. They don’t want your kids in there. I don’t know how much more simply I can say it. There is them, and there is us. In school and in life. They want nothing to do with us. Their schools are their schools. The idea that they’ll welcome your goyim kids into their school because they’ll sympathize with your plight about “woke” public schools, and then you’ll send them to math camp in the summer, is just hilarious. So I don’t know why you are coming in here with nonsense that seems clearly designed to distract and obfuscate.

                        Why don’t I get to reply to the guy who called me a “stupid old biddy”? I can’t believe the rock-bottom level of discourse that prevails among self-proclaimed members of the supposedly genetically superior “white” race. You’re supposed to have such high IQs, but in the end, all you can do is call names.

        Giambattista Vico had a great term for our present age; “the barbarism of reflection”
“such peoples [in the barbarism], like so many beasts, have fallen into the custom of each man thinking only of his own private interests and have reached the extreme delicacy, or better of pride, in which like wild animals they bristle and lash out at the slightest displeasure”

        AI Hitler (below) pointed out that most white Jews are of Turkish origin. Also Germanic/Eastern European. The Black Hebrew Israelites and the Rastas may most nearly be the descendants of the Biblical Hebrews. Haiilie Selasie, the Lion of Judah, late Lord of Ethiopia, claimed descent from Solomon and the Queen of Sheba.
Maybe these tunnelers are Hamas operatives disguised as orthodox Jews.

            You’ve got it wrong. This is how it works:
The tunneling Jews are in-fact working in cahoots with the Freemasons; the Freemasons, who are working on behalf of the reverse-vampires have also formed an alliance with the Christadelphians (see Karl Horst, below) who have been pushed into this by BigAg.
The question is: if the reverse-vampires and BigAg are controlling things, to what end? What is it they have in common?

        They are strange and perverse parasites.   They have used their power and influence to promote other parasitic  groups with the goal of weakening the white race and thus America.   This has been effective at giving them more power.Their problem is they have been too effective.  Their societies have never been self sufficient even on a small scale going back thousands of years.  Whether they realize it or not they need Uncle Sugar.  A healthy Uncle Sugar.   So they will probably succeed in killing the host but they will also be the victims of their own weapons.Israel itself has only one important friend now.  That friend grows weaker by the day.   Some of their politicians boast of their “Samson Option” should things go badly for them.   I would guess if that starts to play out Russia and China would obliterate them.    Russia and China do not have retarded zombie governments like the USA.  They are unlikely to allow Israel to destroy the world because normies in America have been brainwashed to think God is on their side.

        Rarely is the focus placed on these cults that deliberately force through changes in American life that are detrimental to the people who were there before them. A story of Hasidic takeover of a public school board. Well worth the time to listen or read the transcript on the eventual consequences of this engineered capture of a public school district for the benefit of the Hasidic Yeshiva system.A Not-So-Simple Majorityhttps://t.co/YxH903ULLAA few excerpts:Paying the Danegeld?“The original deal that was made many, many years ago was, if we don’t investigate whether or not there’s education going on in the yeshivas, then the rabbis won’t tell their people to vote down our school budget.”Sounds like extortion.…he says the deal was to give the Jewish schools as much money as was legal. Friedman says he would regularly meet with Hasidic rabbis and yeshiva administrators. His pitch was always, we will give you whatever we can. Just don’t vote down our budgets.”https://twitter.com/ArthurinCali/status/1745520627254223343

                It’s not a matter of not caring for them. I see these guys as a clear and present danger and I think the position has merit. When you ask, “why are they here?” … the answer is obvious. They are here to infiltrate a global super power and bend it to serve their interests…which don’t align with ours at all. They go there by paying someone off, and then more came.People noticed this stuff back as early as the 50’s and became laughingstocks in the 60’s. They were painted as clowns like Archie Bunker.I dunno…all I know for sure is that when dissidents and conspiracy theorists are screaming bloody murder about something… it’s wise to listen to them before you laugh.

            Emj calls us “whiteboys” , we call Emj an “antisemite”. They are both slurs. Like you I’m both.
Emj rolls his eyes at us, and Jared Taylor and Z rolls their eyes at Emj.
It’s a little weird, to the point that there is something external influencing both contempt for each other.
Both Z and Emj are trying to make each other low status by using these slurs. I think it’s suspicious. How can Emj be “mixed race” ? And how can you not notice the bizarre influence THEY have in formerly white Society

                    E. Michael Jones. His position, which I do believe has merits, is that “white” is a meaningless label applied by the elites. Maybe in the past being white had good connotations amongst the elite, but now it has bad connotations, as evidenced by that other label, “Black” (note the capitalization). If you address yourself as “white”, you are accepting their frame, their view, of the world, and that includes the fact that your skin color makes you bad. He wrote a book on this, “The Slaughter of Cities”, which said that the elites deliberately broke up the ethnic neighborhoods of the cities, where, faced with the chaos that was caused by mass migration of blacks from the south, people ceased to be Polish, Irish, Lithuanian, German, Italian, etc., and all became “white” (and, thus, bad). He has said that people need to stop thinking of themselves as “white” and start thinking of themselves in terms of their ethnic heritage and their religion (Catholic, Lutheran, etc.).Where he loses me is that he really does seem to believe in a boomer-esque “race is only skin deep” and that racial differences are totally and completely irrelevant.

                        Labels come and go but reality is permanent. And the reality is that, regardless of whether you’re Icelandic, Bulgarian, Finnish  or Portuguese, you’re white. We should all recognize as much and rally together rather than Balkanize just because white has become an epithet.

                        Catholic means universal. EMJ is trying to get a particular (identity) from a universal.
He gets a lot right in his analysis imo, but catholicity is the fly in the ointment.

                        Where he loses me is trying to deal with the problem at a level well below the point of attack.  Sure, everyone has a more particular identity – with the more particular ethnicity at the center (e.g., Welsh, Brit, Northeastern European, European/White).
In AINO (and the entire West), we are being attacked at the White/European level, so that is where we need to respond.  Like the Germanic tribes wrt the Romans, the Cherusci and Langobardi can settle other differences later.

            It’s a funny one, Mr. Filthie; only today, I just “wikipedia’ed” Janet Yellen – Jewess. I made a point of noticing, and clicking on, every linked name on the page… Lo! They were almost all Tribe members!
Then, when on the page for one fellow, I browsed again… Lo! Many Tribe members – all linked to economics, high finance and politics.
The simple fact is the one we all know:The tribe, despite their relatively small numbers in the States, seem to have a large proportion of people in the power-networks of the country.
Lord have mercy on us all.

                Yep. By the way, apparently you’ve started dropping bombs on some people that refer to themselves as Houthis this morn. No doubt, we’ll find out later today why this obscure tribe is suddenly threatening us. Lindsay Graham will be proven correct  in that it is vital to America’s interest to bomb Iran.
And any jewish involvement in any of this will be purely innocent and coincidental…

                        I think the UK was involved too, OF.I’m afraid the JQ is a new sore point for me. I was brought up to stand with our closest ally and to be sensitive to jewish wounds like the holocaust. After a deep dive and hours of fact checking…suffice it to say I had some bitter feelings toward these guys that had pulled the wool over my eyes. Aw, helll…I pulled the wool over my own eyes I guess. It didn’t even occur to me to check these guys out. Jewish victimhhod was a narrative I grew up with and it didn’t even occur to me to question it. Such oversights infuriate me…what other narratives do we blindly accept as fact, that are based on lies told by the lowest people?Getting played for a fool is a humiliating slight. It leaves one bitter and angry…

                    To Filthie @10.28AM: Yes, Christianity arose because Judaism could not answer the questions of changing times. So did Hasidism: bloody pogroms of Ukrainian Cossacks in 18c Ukraine and gloom of survivors were not addressed by traditional Judaism, and thus a new branch of Judaism arose.Hassidism was shunned by traditional religion for a while, but then gained so many followers that it blossomed and is still here.

                        Koreans reek of garlic and fermented cabbage, are neurotic when not full-on psychotic… and think of the Japanese as being their ‘Cossacks’ with concomitant multigenerational woe-is-me weapons grade grudge bearing. They also tend to think that Koreans are ethnically the purest greatest race ever to have lived and are not at all embarrassed to say it.
So yes, I can see why the Talmud would appeal to them. And Woody Allen.

        America is a breeding ground for weird religions and cults. And these days, the world is accustomed to freaks and pervs and zombie’s that roam the streets of San Francisco, New York, and Philadelphia. It’s all part of the tapestry of America.So a few guys with weird hats and bad haircuts climbing out of tunnels under their club house doesn’t even raise an eyebrow these days.I ran a quick search on Wikipedia of American religious movements, and wow, America sure has some winners!I seem to remember one I heard on the radio called the Presbo-bapterian foursquare disco discount house of worship. Pretty sure it was a joke, but maybe not.Just a few of the multitude of bizarre American religions –Louisiana VoodooOld Lights and New LightsRiver BrethrenNew Thought MovementChristadelphiansScientologyReformed Druids of North AmericaChurch of the SubGeniusOur Lady of Perpetual ExemptionChurch of the Flying Spaghetti MonsterSource:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religious_movements_that_began_in_the_United_States

            Left off perhaps the largest church: the Cult of the Holy Tranny.Something interesting there in that the old world expelled it’s most zealous people to the New World, so this would infer, perhaps, a genetic component to such behavior.

                    They didn’t hate it enough. Ultimately, they tolerated and then ratified Christianity. Soon thereafter Rome collapsed. Tolerance is the virtue of a dying civilization. And I say all this as a Christian, by the by.

        They are not Hebrews…Who is Esau/Edom ?https://archive.org/details/who-is-esau-edomMany reference and historical sources have unequivocally identified that the bulk of the Ashkenazi Jews were derived from a people known as Khazars (or Chazars in some texts). The original Jewish Encyclopedia of 1905, revealed that the main stock of the Jews came from this Asiatic people known as Chazars or Khazars:—CHAZARS: A People of Turkish origin whose life and history are interwoven with —the very beginnings of the history of the Jews of Russia. . . .Historical evidence —points to the region of the Urals as the home of the Chazars.°“the large majority of surviving Jews in the world is ofEastern European—and thus perhaps mainly ofKhazar—origin. If so, this would mean that their ancestorscame not from the Jordan but from the Volga, not fromCanaan, but from the Caucasus; .. .and that genetically theyare more closely related to the Hun, Uigur and Magyartribes than to the seed of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.”

                So you have some Sephardic ancestry. Still, my guess is people would see you more as Ukrainian (or East European) than Iberian. Genetics tends to work out that way.

            You mostly accept the Jewish idea that they are a unique people who have jealously guarded their religion and ethnicity throughout centuries of living in the diaspora; while suggesting that they aren’t descended from Hebrews at all, but from Khazars. The argument that Jews are an off-shoot of a Central Asian ethnic group, who converted to Judaism through contact with random practitioners of Judaism, really misses the point.I believe a better answer to this argument of origins is hiding in plain sight for all to see. Nearly any Ashkenazim you meet will look a lot like Europeans. Mizrahim, on the other hand, resemble Arabs. And Jews in Central America (there are a few) may favor Mayans. Why is that? You know the answer. Jews have intermarried with the peoples among whom they lived, while still maintaining a Jewish identity in some instances.

                Genetically, Ashkenazim are 70-75% European and 25-30% Semitic. They thus have enough genetic material to look white while also possessing enough alien genetic material to ensure that their behaviors and thoughtworld depart quite dramatically from ours. Ashkenazim are ideally designed to be shapeshifting moles. And they are intelligent enough to work their malfeasance very very effectively, indeed.

        “No offense to these people, but we have our own weirdos. We are full up.”Heh.All offence to them, I’m afraid Mr. Z Man. Like so many, they come, abide by their own ways; completely alien to the heritage peoples. We’ve had it here (in England) for too long, you in the States too – they should never have been welcome. Along with, in the States’ case, quite literally millions of others.Of course, the interesting thing about the statement “no offence”, is that the following statement will oftenalwaysoffend the recipient. May as well just say: “You were never wanted, and likely never needed.”.God bless you and all reader here. I’ll get on with listening to the show now.

A stifling security bureaucracy that provides dubious safety benefits and is little more than a thinly veiled jobs program, overpriced snacks and a food court staffed by immigrants, long delays and malfunctioning equipment.

I believe that this is the fundamental issue, and it is Evil. It is driven by Evil. Many of these folk have no connection to the heritage white population, they don’t understand them at all. Even other GoodWhites queue up to displace such peoples – their own peoples in many cases.
