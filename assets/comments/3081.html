        BY far right I mean the ‘we are doomed’ crowd who believe the collapse of civilization is eminent.  It’s delusional to think the dollar is worthless when all the evidence says otherwise.

        We are focked.  Does anyone think Christie, Rubio, Clinton, Warren give a shot about the citizens?  Left, right, both will take all they can and give only what they have to. Power corrupts……

        Far-right, greyenlightenment? Speaking of delusions, what is your idea of what is far-right? Nazis? UKip? Z-man? Dark-enlightenment? Whatever enlightenment is, it is not grey.

        that’s a long post . I can see why you get frustrated at the Republican inc. consultant class because they see the world in an oversimplified manner, when there are many subtleties and gradations that they miss. These moneyed lnc. Republicans with their useless degrees, venality and lack of knowledge and in-depth perspectives are just as bad as the Democrats. While the Monopoly Man and Mr. Rogers Republicans who inhabit a sterile, insular world and have never even seen a ghetto are useless, so too are those on the far-right with their conspiracy theories and other delusions.
