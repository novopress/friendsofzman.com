        “In the United Kingdom where the transient political factors are entirely different, the ruling Conservative Party runs on a platform of Capping Welfare and Reducing Immigration.”Er, no. The theory of reducing welfare handouts is undermined by not only the fact Cameron’s lot spend more and more on benefits and handouts, but also the all too obvious fact that there is very little control over immigration. Our EU masters (should that be kaisers as it is essentially Germany) decree a Europe wide policy of reduced border controls and every year tens of thousands flood into the UK for all the free money they can get.It is a delicious thought that the Cameron-led government has control of both public spending and immigration. Neither is true.

            The same can be said of Republicans in the States. They may use the language of small government, but when they had the chance they spent like lunatics.

        You have a habit of using acronyms without explaining what they mean. What on earth does CML and NAM mean? I can’t tell by context alone, and I shouldn’t have to read 50 of your old articles to be able to figure it out.

            Yeah, I should probably build a reference list of my weird abbreviations and TLA’s.
NAM = Non-Asian Minority
CML = Cult of Modern Liberalism
