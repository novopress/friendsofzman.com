        “The Israelis and Arabs have run most of the Christians out of Lebanon, for example.”
You might take a look at Brigette Gabriel’s You Tube videos. She says she was rescued BY the Israelis, when the Christians in their town were about to be murdered by the Muslims.

        For proof of my assertion, take a look over at the conservative cult website HotAir.  They wrote a story about how this is a big political win for Cruz.  The comments are full of hosannahs and praise for Cruz.  He stood up to those bigots!  Really, the responses write themselves.

        ZMAN, you frequently, and correctly, describe liberalism as a cult, but the sad truth is that conservatism, at least in its current form, is also a cult.  Whenever someone tells you that they are not Republican, but conservative, they’ve flashed their cult ID.  Cruz accepts the dogma, and mouths the catechism, so he becomes a conservative messiah.Cruz is not completely cynical; he’s as much a member of the cult as he is a leader of it.  I suspect he thought the Middle Eastern Christians were also members of the cult, and was shocked when they didn’t link arms and start chanting when he began spouting the mantra.  While I don’t agree with this type of anti-Semitism, I can understand that those people were appalled at Cruz’s bovine ignorance.  They have their own identity, and their own problems (serious, existential problems); wanted to see them acknowledged, discussed, and addressed; and were rightly appalled when Cruz dragged Israel into the discussion.  Israel is a powerful country with a powerful patron, a well-funded and well-connected lobbying arm, a wealthy and influential diaspora, and nuclear weapons.  The Middle-Eastern Christians have nothing and no-one.  The fact that Cruz felt the need to drag Israel into the discussion was inept, insensitive, and insulting.  I’m glad to see the audience booed him off the stage.  It should happen more often.

        Ted Cruz is a slightly smarter Marco Rubio, or a slightly dumber Obama.  Conservatives who vilify Obama for being a one term Senatorial dilettante with no discernable qualifications for the Presidency are being hypocrites when they tout Cruz.  Cruz is a fraud, a 21st century Sammy Glick, reeking of ego and ambition, who will screw his supporters at first opportunity, as soon as he has real power.His ignorant speech doesn’t surprise me, given that he reeks of the type of ignorance that thinks the whole world secretly desires to adopt the civilizational values espoused by Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck.  Despite graduating from Princeton and Harvard, or perhaps because of it, Cruz is poorly educated which, combined with a high IQ and overweening arrogance, is a dangerous cocktail.  He’s an inept strategist and a poor problem solver, and the cracks are beginning to show.  Cruz accompanied Beck on his inane trip to give apples and toys to the Children’s Crusaders, which shows that his insecurity and need for liberal approval is stronger than people think.  Mark my words, now that Rubio is a dead fish, Cruz will be the point man for the massive Republican betrayal on immigration.

            The funny thing about Cruz, at least to me anyway, is he has done nothing to show he is worth a vote for president. That’s not a bad thing. I’ve done nothing to earn your vote, but I’m not running for president. The governor of Wisconsin, in contrast, has done a lot of heavy lifting for conservative causes. The governor of Indiana has proven to be a competent executive.
Yet, none of the “experts” talk about these two. Instead it is the parade of ambitious trimmers like Cruz, Rubio and Paul.

        Cruz is no idiot, a fool maybe, but still a pretty sharp cookie. My bet’s on clever.
