        That’s off the charts, Z. Unfortunately half the GOP is in bed with these jokers too. It’s why elections are increasingly becoming an exercise in naked cynicism.

        It’s interesting but I don’t really see the conspiracy.  This is at the bottom of the list of things I’m concerned about.

        No. Chelsea Clinton was married at Astor Courts, which is not owned by George Soros. A simple internet search will confirm this. Do some research before writing conspiracy articles!

            The Nigerian money scams are still prevalent today. Are the Clintons still collecting from them?

            According to The Hudson Valley News, tents have gone up at Astor Courts in Rhinebeck, New York, the likely location of Chelsea Clinton’s wedding this weekend to financier Mark Mezvinsky of Goldman Sachs.   The newspaper has also filled in questions about where the Clintons will supposedly be staying.Former President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will be accommodated at Glenburn, the home built for John Jacob Astor IV, American millionaire  businessman who perished in the sinking of the Titanic.  The mansion is currently the Rhinebeck home of Eric and Andrea Colombel.  Andrea Colombel is the daughter of billionaire financier George Soros, a long-time Clinton supporter.
