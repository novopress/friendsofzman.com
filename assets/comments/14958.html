        The other side of this is people want to believe what they want to believe. So any publisher who panders to their way of thinking will do so for as long they have an audience. Especially those who lack critical thinking skills and are incapable of thinking for themselves.

            I frequent a few boards that are largely Euro based. Mostly tech types and was surprised by the content they view. Young Turks is one for god’s sake. And of course the usual denigration of Trump in offhand remarks.
I used to overlook such things on non political sites, but now give back in spades to those fools.

                There is no Fox News International. The UK government specifically forbade Murdoch from changing Sky News into a right-wing broadcaster. Not to defend Murdoch and his family, who are not our friends (a real friend would give us Fox Nightly News on the broadcast network, not a cable news ghetto). Additionally there is only Fox, rather than two or three competing right-wing networks like ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC, BBC. The best we had was RT, which has been hit by the sanctions.

            Karl Horst, it’s all about the dopamine.  Publishing to the prejudices of the reader releases a pleasurable and addictive dopamine hit in the reader, when he reads what he already believes in.  Google and FB play on this in an interactive fashion, while the NYT and WP just throw stuff at the wall to see what sticks.  These guys are no more than streetcorner drug dealers, in an indirect sort of way.

            People with higher degrees make good targets for propaganda and cons because they ‘know’ how smart they are and, being arrogant about their own intelligence, will not be open minded about the possibility they don’t have a bead on things. Otherwise very smart people. My sister and her husband are like this — they each have a PhD and are pathetically proud of this academic achievement. She in particular makes clear that she believes the media, even ridiculous stuff, and tRump is a lying, bigoted, sexist, narcissist. We still can’t talk about the ’16 election or politics. I despair because after all this brainwashing the quality of our people in this country suffers and that will make it impossible to turn things around.

            fake news needs to be smart. Instead it is stupid and childish.
As Karl says, MPAI, and a large percentage of those who are not swallow what they want to hear.  Just like no one every went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American people, I doubt the fake news purveyors will fade into the sunset.  At least not until everything comes crashing down or withers away.

        Well it probably is fake given the source. But if … IF it’s true… then the liberals just admitted there is a Deep State problem, and it’s a problem they created. Either way … can I please start shooting now? Or building the gallows?

        It was former CIA director Bill Casey that Woodward lied about hearing the deathbed confession from, not Bob.  Chuck Colson was in the same hospital at the time and witnessed Woodward harassing hospital staff trying to get into Casey’s room.  As a friend, Colson was invited up to see Casey and reported that Casey was unable to speak and that his room had 24 hour security.  When the book was released and Colson reported what he witnessed, the press tried to smear him as liar because of his connection to Watergate, even though he had spent the years since his release from prison running a Christian prison ministry and was not active in politics.

            Ooops. Thanks. I fixed it.
Yeah, IIRC, one of Casey’s security detail also spoke out about it. He said he witnessed Woodward trying to convince hospital personnel to let him through.
Frankly, I’ve always suspect that Deep Throat was a fiction. When Mark Felt claimed he was Deep Throat, it struck me as the last act of a dying man. Woodward went along with it because he took the onus off him to reveal his source, who probably never existed. In reality he was fed information from White House people like Dean and Haig. Felt could have been another source.

                This explanation sounds reasonable.  Felt was bitter about getting passed over for FBI director when J Edgar Hoover died.

                    No doubt. The trouble with fingering him as the source is the physical impossibility of it. There were claims attributed to Deep Throat that could not have come from Felt. There were meetings that he could not possibly have attended. It’s possible he was talking to the Post. In fact, it is probable. I just never believed for a second the dramatic telling of the whole Deep Throat narrative. I think they made up the character to salt their reporting. By reporting, I mean stenography.

        I am wondering, with all this Russian hacking nonsense, experiencing it first hand and knowing how laughable and absurd it is, but seeing the media and establishment treat it with utter seriousness, will our children or grandchildren’s history books reflect all of this as fact, as things or threats that really existed?  Will the typical suburban American history text inculcate all of this as realism, or is there a judgement in history and there will be a rational corrective?  Are many of the things we are taught in history as make believe as all of this, and really reflecting the interests of elites?

                Yeah, Rich, and who wins this time will likely be largely determined by how much Trunp dares to declassify, esp. about the corrupt FISA etc. evidence.He must probably tread carefully, because if he declassifies so much that all FBI testimony (esp. in 302 forms) is discredited, the Federal court system could be *deluged* with defendants’ appeals, challenging those convictions obtained via testimony on such forms.
The FBI has become Too Big to Fail.

                    Declassify everything..Half the people convicted by FBI evidence should probably be freed anyway. Mueller sent 4 guys to prison in MA for a murder he knew they didn’t commit…Later on, that cost the government $101 million.

                That may be true in most cases, with the exception to the rule being the Arabs in the Arab-Israeli wars/conflicts.Of course that may be partially explained by the ease with which the world generally is willing to accept their alternate versions of history.In this case the losers are able to continue to write history because their enemy is the Jews, and the world they are selling their tripe to is a mostly anti-Jew one (much more descriptive and accurate than anti-Semitic).

Read up on the Inquisition, or the Wars of Religion, and you can’t help thinking “wait, they actually **killed people** over this?!?”  Such will be Russian hacking, pussy hats, transgenderism, and all the rest — life and death at the time, incomprehensible even a generation later.

            The media want to frame the Trump era the same way they did the Joe McCarthy era.  The narrative I learned about McCarthy in high school was that he was a lying opportunist with temporary control of the country.  Only later did I discover that McCarthy’s charges were largely correct, even understated.
If we lose, history will record that Trump gained temporary control by inflaming the racism of older whites until he was defeated by vibrant multiracial USA led by the fearless media.

                Line, instead of arguing about what McCarthy and the MSM did then, I advise hitting ’em with Trump’s (mostly implicit?) charge, that their irresponsible cow about this Russia stuff makes McCarthy’s worst deeds seem utterly tame by comparison.This MSM Russia tantrum is very arguably the most “laughable” (h/t Chomsky) orgy of *mass* journalistic malpractice in history, according to, not only various Righties (e.g. Sundance, athttps://theConservativeTreehouse.com/), but also widely-respected Lefties (e.g. Chomsky and Greenwald).*These* Lefties see this orgy as an ironic exercise of “(mainstream) lefty McCarthyism”.I’ll wager, that coming months will see that view being effectively vindicated, in much (most?) of the public mind.And, *these* (far) Lefties may well then concede, that this was all a Dem Establishment frame job vs. Trump, to hide the Dem Establishment’s sabotage of Bernie’s bid vs. Hillary.(Greenwald has already hinted at this.)

        My working hypothesis is that the Trump organization planted the NYT article as a media psy-op to provide the pretense necessary to declassify the documents from Mueller’s investigation and to take the Kavanaugh hearings off the top of the news cycle. As a bonus, it drove a wedge between the news organizations previously united against Trump. The NYT is completely isolated on this one.There are no meaningful new revelations in the article. It’s just a rehash of the allegations in the Woodward book with an “I’m an insider” spin attached to it. The article is red meat (or should I say tofu?) for the fever swamp of Trump haters, but there’s nothing in the article that can hurt Trump.Trump knew damn well that this article would be catnip for the NYT editorial staff. (Query: Was Sarah Jeong in on the decision to publish?). The article provides credence to Trump’s claims that there exists a conspiracy within the government to undermine his presidency, which is exactly what he needs to justify declassifying the documents. IMO this was a brilliant media play by Trump.

            I’m no fan of the eleventy-D chess stuff, but that actually sounds more plausible than the NYTimes version. It really does feel like a 4Chan gag.
I think the most likely scenario is it is Kellyanne Conway’s husband. So, it is not entirely fake, but mostly fake.

        The writer of the recent NYT editorial seems to be an undercover saboteur from the Bill Kristol wing of the party. Trump needs to purge these types after the election.
It could also be a hoax. (The editorial certainly reads like a parody of GOPe beliefs.) But who can tell?

Women who have no idea how to do laundry.  And vice versa.  Bankers who can’t fill out paperwork correctly.  Medical offices that are understaffed because they can’t find someone competent and willing to work.  And so on.  This country is in a world of hurt whenever the last of the boomers retire and the majority of everything is run by Gen X and Millenials.  A world of hurt.

            Well, SES, you may be right about other sectors, but journalism may still be the worst sector, esp. in the Imperial City.Medical offices, banks, etc., are less likely to be overrun by self-reinforcing ideologies than are newsrooms, where coverage of public affairs (to which SJW ideologies so clearly pertain) IS the biz at hand.These ideologies are thus more likely to become the Talk of the Office in the MSM.Whereas, if the subject of (SJW) ideology emerges in a medical etc. office, this emergence is more likely to be accidental, and frowned upon by the brass.And, J-schools are more likely, than med schools etc., to transmit fervent SJW ideology.

When the malfunctions reach a critical mass, a cascade of failures will ensue.  In our politics, we are almost there.  Some event out of left field will send DC cascading into failure.

        While dishonest, yellow journalism has been alive and well in the USA since the days of George Washington, it is different this time; a lot different.Up until the time of the Vietnam War -give or take –  news outlets offered a diversity of “biased” reporting; mostly newspapers and perhaps a TV “talk” show of sorts .Of course, during WWII, WWI, etc., this was not the case re: war news, but aside from that if you looked around a bit, you could find several different points of views in those days. This is not surprising because there were many more newspapers back when and most “reporters” never went to journalism (i.e., Marxist propaganda) school.TV of olde always had more uniformity of thought, but prior to the Vietnam War, at least Cronkite, et.al., did not hate everything about the USA (as do today’s “reporters.)What IS different today about the media is the 10000% uniformity of pro-leftist thought and speech; it is straight out of Orwell’s 1984 “Ministry of Truth.” This uniformity of the media, previously, was only found in the USSR or Hitler’s Germany or present day Cuba, N.Korea.And what is also different today is that the media has voluntarily and willingly become the propaganda arm of the democrat/ party/ANTIFA/BLM/Workers Socialist Party.Yep, no need to threaten reporters with a permanent vacation to a Siberian gulag or a boxcar ride to your certain gas-induced murder to print / recite today’s left wing propaganda. They do it willingly and without any sort of coercion.In this regard, their actions are more insidious and duplicitous than those reporters of  Pravda or Izvestia under Joe Stalin. At least in the good old days of the communist USSR – a time when the democrat (i.e, Marxist-Leninists) party here in the USA was in love with Mother Russia – readers KNEW they were getting the govt. line. After all, the state owned the media.The media today in the USA can still claim that they are independent; which legally they are. But in every other meaningful sense, they are as just as beholden to the left as was Der Deutsche Beobachter beholden to the anti-capitalist , socialist , failed Austrian artist , Adolph Hitler.

            Yeah, John, there were indeed many more newspapers back when, and most “reporters” never went to *journalism* (i.e., Marxist propaganda) school.TV of olde always had more uniformity of thought, but… least Cronkite, et.al., did not *hate* everything about the USA (as do today’s “reporters.)And, more papers (and other outlets) had *local* ownership, who couldn’t easily be implicitly threatened with anti-trust prosecution etc.So, yeah, in every meaningful sense, they are almost as beholden to the Left, and the Deep State, as if they were owned by these folks.See (lefty) Sheldon Wolin’s insights on “inverted totalitarianism”.(In my view, he puts too much weight on the corporate part, and not enough on the Deep State.)

        Like their ridiculous physical appearance (think Pajamaboy), the Left’s blithering idiocy is actually another potent weapon.  Just as nobody sees a 95 lb. dreadlocked soy-sicle like Eric Clanton as a threat — which lets him get close enough to brain you with a bike lock — so the fact that these guys are just so. fucking. stooooopid makes it impossible to believe we could ever lose to them…. so we do.

        I don’t think Trump or any of his people had anything to do with this (but I wouldn’t be surprised at all, if their are Bush fingerprints all over it).  His gift, is to see things like this and make them work for him.   By being patient, and taking what the “game” gives him at any one time, he avoids doing anything actionable (e.g. Nixon and Watergate).  With the widespread tertiary syphilis in the progressive camp, you know something will pop up every day that can be used against them.

        4D chess theory: Trump had one of his senior administration officials plant that op-ed in the NY Times to give himself an excuse to purge Deep Staters and Obama/Bush/NeverTrump holdovers from his administration.
Yes, I know it’s wild. But it is actually the theory that makes the most sense.

        Yes, fake news is now ubiquitous and obvious, but it is more than just propaganda. It is part of the memetic assault on the mush-minded that is actively and effectively reprogramming modern cultural and political beliefs. Repetitive messaging is an important technique that enhances success. In other words, the mass market news media isn’t just annoying, they are dangerous like a plague.

        Good essay.  I certainly agree with its relation to the press; meanwhile “the weak leading the crazy” applies to a myriad of American industries &amp; institutions.  “The weak” are often very intelligent and highly schooled, but they tend to poorly educated chuckleheads who’ve never actually produced anything of value.  If they’re in the senior leadership realm (running the gamut from military flag officers to bishops to captains of industry) they’ve typically arrived at the top because of their Machiavellian political skills, which means on the exigent matters of the day they’re experts in manipulating people and truth, and not much else.  These are the men who can’t do basic wiring, change their oil, grow a potato, or clean a sink trap … so if we’re headed for cultural/economic collapse I say bring it on, as it’s the only thing that will wipe these guys out.

        I find it amusing the right wants to dismiss this when, incidentally true or not, it is conceptually the reason for Trump being a mediocrity on the issues they care about. Sedition prevents anything but neoliberal policy from being pursued in ernest. If that were not the case, one would have to suppose Trump himself was in on the joke.

            Z-Man’s Corollary to Hanlon’s Razor: Never dismiss malice as the cause of most stupidity.
I think the thing could be a setup by a prankster in the White House or it could be a genuine subversive. I think the NYTimes was stupid to run with it and I think they were motivated by ideological fervor.
The elephant in the room for months now is all of those hidden and redacted documents related to the FBI scandal. With a stroke of his pen, Trump can dump all that stuff into the public domain. He now has another reason to do so.

            You actually see the left as rising? In reality, it’s more like death throes, hence the “setting sun” metaphor. Get it now?

                Einstein, you do realize that the temperature drops as the Sun sets?   That Zman was using a mixed metaphor that was self-negating?  That my comment on a specific phrase was a literary criticism?

                            One can feel the heat of the sun even as it sets.  Most have experienced this, it is well known. The metaphor has naught to do with the relative temperature at different times of the day, so not a mixed metaphor, McHungus. He isn’t comparing apples to oranges, that dog won’t hunt.
