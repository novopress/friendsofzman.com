        “my nephew’s unarmed 17-year-old friend” was inside the domicile of a complete stranger, one whose house had been burgled multiple times. There are many facts that have yet to come to light in this case, so I do not presume the guilt of the dead youth. Neither do I presume his complete innocence; basing my suspension of presumption on the indisputable evidence of his whereabouts at the time of his death. The local “news” is attempting to rally the public to decry Castle Doctrine. This being MT, they are likely to find sympathy only in Missoula – our own tired imitation of Boulder, CO.

        As long as “certain” protesters decide it’s OK to mass assemble outside someone’s home, there’s no need to even discuss large capacity magazines and semi automatic rifles with “scary looking” accessories.Say, that execution WAS kinda’ dismal wasn’t it? I wonder why they weren’t using some other, “more humane”, and positive cocktail, like a hot shot of heroin/speedball so popular amongst “celebrities”, or maybe phenobarbital? Did FDA not approve of the lengthy disclaimers….as seen on tee vee, or in (ie)Time magazine.In any case, the convicted individual was most certainly deterred from ANY further escalation of the crime rate “data”, or incurring “special” medical expenses for…say…gender transformation surgery/drugs/bathroom remodeling, or “special” diet considerations for “suddenly” found religion on day two of incarceration.
