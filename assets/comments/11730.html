        This boomer gave up many illusions years ago. These conservatives you talk about are the same I experienced in the 80s.Run it up the flag pole and they will salute it, support our police and troops, the Constitution, enterprise zones, blah blah.Like Joe Sobran who said he took an embarrassingly long time to see the reality of our times and what passes for Conservatism.Gavin and the Steven Crowder types still say it is the welfare state of the sixties that caused all this racial trouble. Before that there was no difference in blacks and whites.God help us.

        I read your post and it left me hanging, in a sense.Your statements are provocative, to say the least, and I am trying figure out what the bottom-line is in your commentary.You say white people have a “fetish” over the Constitution.  Are you suggesting it is insufficient or should be replaced?You say, “Despite the ridiculousness of it, most constitutional conservatives are convinced America is built on Judeo-Christian values.”  Do you have a more precise view of morality, or a better way to describe the mindset of colonial thinkers and the generations of moral, church-going people who followed?  How does your statement align with the following:“Only a virtuous people are capable of freedom.  As nations become more corrupt and vicious, they have more need of masters.”“Laws without morals are in vain.”“To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people, is a chimerical idea.”“Bad men cannot make good citizens. It is when a people forget God that tyrants forge their chains. A vitiated state of morals, a corrupted public conscience, is incompatible with freedom. No free government, or the blessings of liberty, can be preserved to any people but by a firm adherence to justice, moderation, temperance, frugality, and virtue; and by a frequent recurrence to fundamental principles.”I could go on with specific questions about your comments on race and patriotism, but I think your bottom-line would answer these questions and provide a clear understanding of what you mean by, “The great challenge for the insurgency is to re-purpose these attributes toward better ends.”I am 53 years old, Christian, white, socially and politically conservative, and don’t claim to have any answers outside of my faith.  I am not without fault, and struggle to resist judgementalism, racism, and skewed versions of nationalism and patriotism.  I hope that you will take this as a legitimate inquiry and not a veiled attack.

                2 thoughts.1) civics has largely been dropped from K-12 education.  Ethics does get taught in college, but usually as an elective that few take or sometimes as a day’s lecture in the context of a particular discipline being studied.  so in short – not much.2) with religion falling out of favor and civics no longer taught, how will current and coming generations build an ethical model to live by?I’m not arguing civics accomplished that on its own, but at least it set a baseline when taught well for what it meant to be an American. Christian upbringing and strong families provided a key foundation for ethical principles for many, perhaps most a generation or two ago.  Now there’s nothing but the non-stop pounding by progressives which as you’ve stated over and over has become a religion.Z, here is a book I read recently which I highly recommend, given the new world emerging around us.  Lots of interesting ideas here that could help us create a framework for what comes next.https://www.amazon.com/Technology-Virtues-Philosophical-Future-Wanting/dp/019049851X

            Most people I have known to use the term “Judeo-Christian” do not do so to be inclusive of current day Jews.  The Jewish population is so small as to be irrelevant.  They do so to reflect the appreciation Christians have for the way Judaism was the precursor to Christianity.  Jesus was a Jew.  Christians believe much of the Old Testament.  This is much like we appreciate the influence of the Magna Carta on our own Constitution, without feeling we are being inclusive of modern day Englishmen.Regarding Zman’s view of how Jews view that term, he is 100% correct.  I spent quite a bit of time in Israel for my work, and the consensus of conservative Jews I discussed this with, was that Jesus was a hippie troublemaker who betrayed his faith.  They have no desire to know anything about Christianity, historical or otherwise.

                A couple of corrections are in order:1)	International Jewry, far from being “irrelevant”, in fact are the MOST influential in all the world, being the purveyors of Mystery Babylon, which God will destroy.2)	Judaism was not the “precursor to Christianity”..  The former is from Babylon—Baal worship, the latter is from God. They are FOREVER diametrically opposed.3)	Jesus was not a “Jew”. He was a Judahite who rejected Judaism and those who adhered to it—namely the Pharisaic “Jews”, whom he called “children of the devil” and “not my sheep”.4)	Christians, by definition, believe ALL of the Old Testament, for it is all God’s Word.Other than that, you came pretty close to the truth.  And the reason Jews “have no desire to know anything about Christianity” is because they are of their father, the devil, and therefore “cannot hear the truth.” Jesus told the Jews:  “He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.”

            There is nothing wrong with the Constitution, what is wrong is with the people and especially the white intelligentsia that runs the show.The myths that we were fed, were from the intelligentsia and corporate America meant to keep us in line and docile. Myths like the notion that desegregation works, that racial harmony is possible, that multiculturalism is a viable concept. That our judiciary is composed of infallible wise men and women. That ghettos are part and parcel of urban life, Or that our private clubs have to let in people we don’t want or like or men with guns come and close it down.They removed Christianity from the mainstream starting in 1947 and kept at it until it’s almost a crime to read the Bible in public schools. Yet for the previous 150 years there was no problem.What we consider “conservative” today is nothing of the sort.  It’s mostly something that appeases the business class. The same applies to most of the “conservative judiciary”, they are really progressives. That is how we get Christian bakers forced to serve gays at the point of a gun and why a kid reading a Bible in school is treated worse than a gangster.or how money equals free speech.Thanks to Buckely and his bastards he twisted it into something that only benefited the elite.while letting the progressive wreck and capture our culture.

                The Constitution begins with an outlandish lie that implies that a superstitious witch like Hillary Diane Rodham (b. 1947) has the right to rule and to “ordain and establish” a constitution for a complex government. Also, the short clause of Article VII is b.s. all the way through, for it merely assumes its own lawfulness before the “Establishment” of A7.
And only a moron would believe–as you do–that his god is a rabble rousing Jew.

            Reply to Tom McAllister:  That you automatically default to SJW buzzwords (“judgementalism, racism, and skewed versions of nationalism and patriotism”) to describe evils you try to resist clearly demonstrates that one of your faults is a lack of clear thinking.  Jesus never condemned the principle of adjudging someone or something as wrong or sinful.  What he condemned was hypocrisy and the finding of faults in others while ignoring one’s own.  Two totally different concepts.  Indeed, Christians are specifically called upon to judge others and rebuke or even shun others who are unrepentant sinners.The term “racism” is meaningless jargon.  Do you object to the categorical proof via genetics demonstrating that “race” is a scientific reality?  Or is it the mere noticing of differences and/or patterns which offends your finely honed morality?  Or, even worse, are you dreadfully shamed by the mere idea that loving one’s own (children, family, nation, people, or race) is not only natural but also God-given and God-ordained?  As repeatedly explained by Scripture, “love” is not a nice feeling but a concrete action out of concern for another’s well-being in accordance with Christ’s teaching.  Jesus showed love when he whipped the money-changers from the Temple.  And equal love for all equals genuine love for none.Judeo-Christian is an oxymoron, yoking two contradictory terms in a bid for approval from the 2% of America that proclaims that, far from being founded by and for a “virtuous people,” the country was intended to be a haven for anyone from every corner of the earth.  They consider a Zionist Jewess’s poem added to a statue intended to represent “lady liberty” as THE founding principle, and view Christianity itself as hypocritical and discriminatory at best, and evil and heretical at worst.  Vox Day has a number of posts detailing the term’s history and false nature and application.The Constitution – a well-intentioned document written as a compromise by primarily decent albeit all too-human Englishmen – is not holy writ.  Many things are ascribed to it and others denied it because its authors either had no opinion on a particular issue or, far more likely, never even considered the possibility of their beliefs, values, and intentions would be deliberately misconstrued or talmudically explained away by a genetically and culturally alien people.I’ll leave it at this and await Zman’s promised future post, but your puzzlement at terms and interpretations he used in today’s post indicates a fundamental lack of awareness of numerous serious debates and concerns within the “dissident” and/or Alt-Right.  These are hardly new concepts or criticisms or issues, and I would suggest that you do your own homework and rather extensive reading here and elsewhere before asking Zman to elucidate that which I assume many if not most readers already understand.

        Well at least your friend is in favor of cracking down on illegal immigration, that’s a good start. Immigration reform and/or gun control are often “gateway drugs” into the Alt-Right. They certainly were for me, along with the realization that “National Cuckservative” type conservatives were not conserving anything except tax breaks for the oligarchs.

        Without a common set of organizing principles, you can build your society out of left handed people who love lemon meringue pie, and it won’t matter a bit.We are already getting a taste of what “ethnic enclaves” look like (to use a term from the Yugoslavian civil war of the 1990’s), and how they pan out.  The alt right or dissident right isn’t going anywhere if that is the default position…to just sort of cleave-off 20-30 large urban areas into their own “Escape from LA” city-states or to skinny the country down into a smaller USA that is 90% white or whatever.  If people are somehow going to be called to “vote their race”, that automatically just erases people like my wife.  She is Vietnamese, smarter than pretty much anybody I know, and is conservative on issues ranging from abortion to race to economics etc. on a level that would make Zman blush.  I guess she’s out of the club, eh?America is a civic religion.  You don’t have to accept that, but it is what it is.  That is why the reaction to the NFL went down like it did.  Those players showed up in the Church of America and started flipping off the parishioners.  Thanksgiving is part of our collective civic religion.  Is the Constitution passe?  Maybe, but it is part of our civic religion.  That’s why gun sales go UP when “gun control” is debated.  People intuitively understand their rights, and threats to those rights, even if they can’t really explain why.  You don’t have to appeal to the angry fans by appealing to race, for example, but by simply pointing out the abject stupidity of the “protesters” … a great many of whom have had serious run-ins with the Law.  Well, of course they’re protesting…nobody likes getting arrested for pistol whipping their girlfriend.I know Zman is sour on the civic nationalism thing, but without a coherent organizing principle – particularly in the absence or decline of Christianity – the whole thing collapses down into ethnic enclaves, civil war, and anarchy.  That is the case EVERYWHERE on the planet.  Religion, be it Christianity or the American civic religion has always been a call to something larger than yourself.  Skin color, race, whatever is not a call to something higher than yourself…it’s the ultimate in self-identity politics.  Worse, fully 1/3 of your fellow white people 100% DO. NOT. AND WILL NEVER. AGREE.  Forget it.They follow a different religion, and lacking a coherent American civic religion, there’s actually zero reason for any of them and any of us to agree on anything.  I think that’s the appeal of Trump by and large – he appeals to that American civic religion which really transcends the founding documents, and looks at America as a unique society that is different and better than societies around us.  If you can’t figure out how to lash those different groups of people together, you’re left with ethnic enclaves that periodically go to war with each other over resources.Alt right, dissident right, whatever, there is not going to be a widespread appeal to race.  Look at the energy blacks put into appealing and organizing around race.  They work their asses off, and they still can’t get to 100%, and they’re miserable!  People will at a gut level sort of vote that way, but it’s not an organizing principle or ideology which is going to motivate people.  It’s not something people would die for.  It’s the tie-breaker in a sea of other choices.To paraphrase Rumsfeld, you build a country with the people you have.  I think the globalists have rather definitively lost control of the “immigration is always and everywhere good” narrative.  I don’t know anybody who thinks that is really true on any level other than to score political points against people they want to call racists.  But they go to what well so many times that a lot of people are like “f**k it, if that makes me a racist, then I don’t care if I’m a racist.”You go to war with the country you have.  The alt right or dissident right or whatever would be better served finding a message the appeals to blacks, asians, indians, “hispanics” (white people who speak Spanish), etc on a level which is unapologetically American.  American is a tribe too.

            “American is a tribe too.”I think it is quite reasonable to assume this to be true, but for whites mostly. That demographic is where most of the true believers are to be found.  Other groups, not so much.

                American is a mindset.  It is unapologetically independent, self reliant, arrogant, etc. but simultaneously selfless, generous, etc.  This is one of the very few countries really ever that has deployed its citizens around the world to any country or people to help in an emergency for no other reason than because we can.When something bad happens in the world, nobody prays for the Russians or Chinese to show up.The flag and the faces which bring hope to people everywhere around the world are undeniably American.That mindset exists across a great many peoples on this planet, but not everyone and not everywhere.  We spend way too much time screening people for immigration based on their “skills” when really we should be screening people and making decisions on whether we let them stay, based on their adherence and fidelity to Americanism.  There are countries which are absolute madness for us to permit immigration from except on severely limited criteria.We don’t have to convince every person in every demographic to agree, but we do need a lot more than just white people, and that is absolutely achievable.

                    I agree with everything you have said.  Unfortunately, the realism of race is that black people will always lag behind due to genetic abstract reasoning deficiencies.  It is measured on every IQ test ever designed, and is most apparent in sections where education and culture have no possibility of influencing results.  Thus, blacks and liberal whites will always blame America for these trends, making it very difficult to reach “e pluribus unum.”

                        I don’t actually care what they think.  We should win over the persuadable, and subsidize the rest into passivity.  Democrats and the Left have reached the limits of identity politics because their different grievance groups are soon going to be going to war with each other.  They can’t simultaneously be the party of unrestricted Muslim immigration and the party of Women’s Rights.  They cannot be the party of the Police Unions and the party of Black Lives Matter.America has never, not once, been a unified country ideologically.  Jefferson and Adams were at each other’s throats.  Civil Wars.  Heck, 1/3 of the country sided with the Crown in 1776.  It will never be the case that we have a unified population.The issue is whether there is a message that can appeal to 55-66% regardless of race or socio-economics which says “America First”.  Right now, that electorate is available and looking for representation.  For the last 25-30 years everybody has been running for office trying to win over the 50% of the country to the left of the center leaving the other half of the country unrepresented.That is where the opportunity resides.

                            I agree you have laid out the best course.  I just would not put much faith in winning over blacks or hispanics.  We can add another 100 years to LBJs infamous quote about blacks.  But as you allude to, they are already at their max benefit to the left.  Hispanics will vote for free stuff for a generation or two, and then will identify as white.  So there is hope there, but not anytime soon.

                                100% agree.  I wouldn’t bother trying to win them over.  I would work on recruiting the ones who don’t need to be won over.  Suburban blacks, IT industry South Asians (India/Pak), and pretty much any East Asians…people who look at the insanity going on around us and understand that we cannot tear down our entire society to appease the mentally unstable.You’re like me about Hispanics.  I understand the whole mestizo thing, but anybody who spends any time watching LATV or Univision with the volume muted understands that those are white people.  Even our Government understands that “Hispanic” is a fabricated category mainly constructed to distribute welfare state spoils.  (i.e. “White (non Hispanic)” on the government forms)In 25 years, Latinos will be the Italians of a generation ago.

They probably figure they can for a few more elections.  It’s worked pretty well so far.  After that, between dead voters, illegal alien voters, multiple-ballot voters, discovering mystery ballots at the last minute,  cooking the books, lying to voters and scaring them … they’ve got it made.

                                Those diametrically opposed groups are going to wind up at war with each other.

About 1/4th of their base is unabashedly anti-American and pro-Marxist…the kinds of people who think Bernie Sanders is a pussy for not just coming out and saying who he really is.The current political landscape in Washington D.C. in 2017 is:1. neo-Marxist revolutionaries storming the barricades of the Establishment Left2. Government Party Republicans taking over the  territory of 1960’s-era LBJ/Kennedy Democrats.3. A loose amalgam of dumb-f**k conservatives who like to vote their “conservative principles” instead of getting actual f**king work done.Virtually nobody represents the half or more of the country that 1 and 2 think is irredeemably foul.  The Deplorables.  The ones 1 and 2 wish would “just die”.  Nobody speaks for the Deplorables until Trump comes along.  That’s why everybody in 1 and 2 is so abjectly terrified of Trump and what he represents.

            Your Vietnamese wife matters not in the least in their Utopia, as she (and all women) will be disenfranchised.    Zman, to be fair, has said maybe married women of a certain age who have produced children will be allowed to vote.  Reading between the lines, the Constitution is just a piece of paper to them.  Race and sex are total identity and destiny, not just biologically but socially and politically as well.  Christianity will be tolerated only to the extent that it is useful. Sounds more than a little messed up to me, about as bad as what we already have and maybe worse.  You know what they say about throwing out the baby with the bathwater. If what I have surmised is incorrect, than the alt or dissident right should stop being coy about what they truly envision for the country’s way forward and clearly state what they hope to accomplish and how. I don’t see how they can possibly stand for liberty and human flourishing or how they can succeed in their goals without vast harm to innocents.

                Comments like yours are why the authors of the Constitution, following the example of all successful republics throughout history, wisely forbade women the franchise.  Race and sex contribute more than any other factors to our identities and destinies, and it is only Utopian progressives such as yourself – and not the so-called “alt-right” – who foolishly deny that this is so. Disdain for the Constitution worship of Conservative, Inc. is nothing more than a recognition that the Constitution, at least in any form that the founders would have recognized, has been a dead letter since the New Deal, if not earlier.  There’s nothing coy about the pessimism that drives the dissident right, only a conviction that the United States has largely ceased to exist and cannot be reconstituted, and that the multiracial, multi-ethnic society that has replaced it is doomed to increasing disorder, violence and tyranny.

That is a true statement, and I wish you the best of luck changing it.
You go to war with the country you have, not the one you wish you had.

Where things really went off the rails was forced integration.
Not just races, no, but when a men’s club became a fern bar, and schools forgot who and what they were for.
Now bathrooms are forcibly integrated as well.
Voluntary segregation, not force suppression.
Freedom of association, a natural right, provides the only true safe spaces- and it allows people to be who they are without the Gestapo.

                I don’t think she means nothing, and I don’t think Zman is a utopian.  I do think there are a lot of very persuadable groups of people in this country who quietly think that trannies are nutjobs, and anybody who advanced the goals of trannies ought not be given the reigns of power.  There are very persuadable groups of people in this country who quietly and not so quietly think that a lot of those NFL players represent a small fraction of criminals, not a broad social justice movement, and are largely pampered millionaires who get their crimes covered up and swept under the rug by local governments eager to appease the team owner.My wife happens to be one of those people.  I get lefties on social media all the time who like to make me out as some knuckle-dragging neanderthal, and I get great joy in telling them that the four most important women in my life – my wife, my two sisters, and my mom – all voted enthusiastically for Trump.I would wager all four of them would find 54% of what is written here to be “too much”.  That doesn’t mean they’re not on my team though.

            America already doesn’t have a common set of organizing principles.Your gun control example is perfect – when a mass shooting happens, there’s no nuanced examination of the issue, and there’s no national coming-together in mourning. The Red Staters are too busy panic-buying guns and ammo and the Blue Staters are trying to push legislation that will ban everything more powerful than a nerf gun and put all male Texans on a federal watch list.America isn’t America because it’s a proposition nation. This country is what it is because smart and industrious Anglos settled a vast, resource-rich, and largely empty land mass with friends to the north, incompetents to the south, and the two best borders in the world to the east and west.The Constitution is a result of what America is, not the other way around.

                That makes absolutely no sense in the context of the era in which the country was formed including 3 continental wars in 60 years, 5 or 6 in its first 100 years (if you count Texas Independence and the Indian wars), two rebellions, TWO governing documents (Articles of Confederation being the first), fact that 1/3 or more of the colonists were loyalists to the Crown, and within 80 years of the founding the entire country was ripped in half in a war that claimed 700,000+ lives.It’s like saying the Pilgrims landed, 300 years of stuff took place, and here we are today because of topology.The issue is *not* that we lack a set of governing principles.  It is that a small cabal of Leftists in concert with the Official Government Party are in open rebellion against those governing principles.  THAT is the opening Trump exploited masterfully, and which people who despise what the Left and the Government Party have inflicted on this country would be well advised to understand, replicate, and expand upon.Trump’s inauguration speech captured the battlespace of this war almost perfectly in content and in tone.  The Left and the Government Party FREAKED OUT because he declared the rest of the country to be in rebellion against THEM.  And they cannot tolerate dissent.That is how we win, and there are lot of blacks, Latinos, Asians, Indians, etc. who agree with us.  We don’t need them all to agree, but the alternative is a Government Party ideology which embraces among other things:– mentally insane people who don’t accept their gender– criminal millionaires protesting “systematic oppression”– Harvey Weinstein, Jeffrey Epstein, and the Clintons– a bankrupt education bureaucracy that is collapsing– mass unrestricted immigration to demographically overthrow the country.I said in 2015 after Trump smacked Jorge Ramos around like an NFL player’s wife that immigration alone would propel him to victory.   That is the path, and that is why the Government Party and the Left are in a death match with Trump over immigration.

                    It’s like saying the Pilgrims landed, 300 years of stuff took place, and here we are today because of topology.Sounds about right, with the correction ” + people” appended to the end of the sentence. We could have never had the American Revolution and we would have ended up in more or less the same place. Any scenario in which the land mass that is now the United States was colonized and settled by the British would have led inevitably to America being an exceptional nation. The specifics don’t matter.I’m going to paraphrase your viewpoint as: “America is a proposition nation/civic religion that transcends base notions such as tribal identity based on race.”The above ideology is what led to the mess we’re in now. It doesn’t work, because at its core it assumes the validity of the blank slate. You can waste your time trying to bring minorities around to civic nationalism in large numbers if you want, but I have better things to do. Lee Kuan Yew had the right of diversity. If you think he was wrong, go on and waste your time trying to bring the 95% of blacks that voted for Obama in ’08 around.mass unrestricted immigration to demographically overthrow the country.You sound very excited that “lots” of America’s non-whites are on our side. Well, “lots” is a relative term. The Constitution, the judiciary, etc. will matterless, not more over the coming decades. “Us” and “them”, “who” and “whom”… that’s where we’re headed.I like, in principle, many of the ideas behind movement conservatism, but those ideas are luxuries that we can no longer afford.

                            Quote exactly where I said otherwise wrt France and Spain. In the long run, the British-derived culture and law dominated the entire country. The fact that some of the land was not originally British is utterly irrelevant, just like your moronic assertion in your previous comment that some fraction of the colonists being loyal to the crown meant demographics has nothing to do with the United States’ success(???).
Quit prattling on nonsensically here and go try to talk some of your pet minorities into voting for Trump in 2020.

        What’s your ride, Z? You don’t strike me as a Harley guy.  😉I used to be one of those guys your buddy was. I believed in the goodness of America, as I live in Canada that is run by liberal morons.  I still do – I love Americans, I love their dedication to that constitution and their traditions. I would have laughed at you and your talk of Cloud People, joos, cuckservatives etc.Then Obama came to office and I started noticing that the racists were right about quite a few things. As were the homophobes. As were the misogynists. It wasn’t a slow awakening – it was like waking up to a hooting, buzzing Red Alert on the Star Trek Enterprise. In a literal flash, I went from being a bland old world conservative – to smirking, conservative dissident stinker every bit as deplorable and reprehensible as the rest of you guys. Then I noticed something else – a lot of you guys weren’t that deplorable and a lot of you were as smart or smarter than I am. A lot of you are good men, straight shooters and patriots in your own fashion.Ignorance is like armour – all you have to do is find that one chink or gap in it – and then it falls away as if it were never there and it’s all over. I think we’re on the right track too: you are getting your argument out on your own terms with the podcasts and blog – formats that are immune to the pozzing of social justice warriors and progs. Gab seems to be picking up steam.I don’t think the bottle neck is guys like me or your friend, Z – I think it’s guys like you. If we had more of them, reaching more people, we could turn the nation around in a week. There is not much wrong with America, or Canada – we just need new leaders and speakers and the courage to support them.

        I finally realized that wistful pining for a return to the conservative values of Eisenhower’s America is little better than believing in Santa Claus – for dozens of reasons, not the least of which is, that country doesn’t exist any more. America 1955 is as foreign to America 2017 as North Korea is. The values, and demographics, of the country have irrevocably changed, so dreaming about “saving America” is a waste of time. it’s already gone. Yup, there’s a whole laundry list of woulda-coulda-shoulda that might have prevented the decay, but Reality is Reality. Without a working DeLorean, we don’t get a do-over.That’s the big difference I’ve seen between myself and my “conservative” friends, many of whom honestly think that if we just follow the Constitution, or just follow Jesus, or just “reset the federal government to the size it was thirty years ago”, everything will magically heal itself. That’s an awful lot of genies to cram back into a lot of bottles. Modern Conservatism is big on nostalgia, but as far as a working plan for moving forward from our current mess – not so much.

        Unfortunately, most folks, whether black or white, are herd animals. They don’t think deeply about the society around them or their place in it and prefer easy, simple answers that let them feel good about themselves.When our elites were avowed white supremacists and segregationists, the herd followed their lead. When our elites decided overt discussion of white supremacy was gauche, and replaced that with civic nationalism, the herd got in line.Now that our elite has lost all self confidence and is committed to population replacement and globalization, the herd follows.We can’t assume most whites will ever wake up. It’s easier to go with the flow, no matter how humiliating that might be.As civilizations die, and populations disaggregate into regional or even tribalized units, white people will, at least the ones who want to survive as distinct people and maintain Western values and sensibilities, regroup and form natural hierarchies around charismatic community leaders and defend themselves and stake out territory.We can try our best to influence as many as we can, but I don’t think the majority are going on the long journey with us. I’d love to be proven wrong about that, though.The West is dying and it’s up to motivated individuals to plant the seeds for new versions of Western societies to grow and flourish.This is a cyclical process that has unfolded many times before.

        For my Catholic Baby Boomer parents, the best line of argumentation goes like this: America is an objectively evil country (in line with traditional Christian notions of good and evil). The purveyors of American culture have us literally celebrating every one of the seven deadly sins and actively discourage all the virtues.
This doesn’t make Americans individually any more evil than all Russians were evil under communism (aka the Evil Empire).
Though this didn’t necissarily convince them of everything, I did see from their reaction that this hit them at the gut level and got them thinking a little.

        “When you point out that the Constitution currently requires Christian bakers to celebrate homosexual weddings, they dismiss this as if it is a lie.”
Do you mean this as in “currently” interpreted, which is a relatively new interpretation, or do you mean that the founding document actually requires this? And, in fact, the very question about forcing a baker to bake a cake for some fags is coming up in the SCOTUS. Even if it is upheld, using the commerce cause, no one is required to “celebrate” anything. Except the all important exchange of money.

Not as originally written, only by amendment and through the lens of progressive judicial interpretation.  I think our founders would be enraged to think the liberty for which they sacrificed, now compels people to participate in gay weddings, purchase insurance products from specific businesses and forbids people from using their own property as they see fit.

                I’m sure the Founders would have been enraged, but they have been dead for a couple of centuries, so it does not matter. That’s the point. Debating what men in powdered wigs intended is entirely pointless. What matters now is what men in black dresses think. Or, what the mob outside their chambers thinks.

                Well, given that both oil and water are liquids, why not put water in your crankcase? All contracts, which the Constitution is, are created at the start of a venture. The language as meant by the original signatories is what determines whether the contract continues to be  honored. You are right in that “might makes right”. But, if we are all just slaves to power, there is no point in making any effort to understand the process as it is and how it became that way. In fact, what is the point in you writing your blog? Ultimately a waste of time, right?

            Just to be precise, it is the (insane) body of public accommodation and non-discrimination laws (or regulations) that require a Christian baker to celebrate homosexual weddings, not the Constitution. We will soon find out whether the First Amendment to the Constitution provides a safe harbor for a Christian to refuse to comply with the public accommodation and/or non-discrimination laws.I understand that, somewhat interestingly, the case is being argued as a free speech case rather than a freedom of religion case. The core of the baker’s argument is that decorating a cake is a form of artistic expression that qualifies as speech and the First Amendment prohibits the government from compelling him to engage in speech.This case arose out of my home state of Colorado. The bake shop is about 10 miles from me. The baker is an evangelical Christian who strives to run his business in accordance with his Christian faith. I hope he wins.

            Yes, there is simply no calculating the damage that football has done to the United States over the last fifty years. I’m not kidding. Energies and cash that should have gone towards reforming our country have been channeled into football, football metaphors have helped to wreck our military and diplomatic strategy (anyone else remember “Linebacker II” the US bombing campaign in Vietnam, launched by the football-crazy Nixon?) and above all, football has fed ordinary Americans of all colors   a false belief about how integration was really all working out. I once loved the game, but its overall effect has been destructive, especially college football and the NFL. Time for it to end, in its present form.

                Professional sports are our bread and circuses. The elites always knew that and that’s why they were the biggest promoters of them. BTW Soccer is used the same way in the 3rd world states.Their use against whites was propagandistic  as you stated – to promote the lie that racial integration worked.  It worked amazingly well to the point you have white guys wearing the jerseys of black ball players and wishing the black players would hit on their wives. The other and more important one was to distract the people intellectually and emotionally and sap their tribal energy.So they no longer noticed the screwing they were getting by corporate America and the government.It was our Soma.And boy did blue collar and middle-class Americans get assraped by these monied interests over the last 40 years, with the 25 being the worst.

                    Yes, the diversion of so much of the energy and loyalty of middle-class whites into sports was one of the great triumphs of the managerial state in the 2nd half of the twentieth century. Glad to see that the spell is finally breaking.

                One of the main redeeming qualities of sports was the call to take pride in one’s locality…”the boys from my cornfed corner of the Midwest are tougher and better than your faggots over there! Yea!”Today even that tie to one’s home is gone, when players are often imported from foreign countries, let alone other sides of the country. It’s even lost in college, now that the sports ball recruits are in an entirely different track than the actual students, and not really intellectual peers like it used to be.  People just cheer for whatever mystery figure is in their favorite color jersey now I guess. So lifeless and pointless.

        Great post, Z.  Just a few days ago I was trying to get these ideas across to my Boomer parents (less articulately, unfortunately) and was fascinated to see them following andagreeingwith me at every point, and then shutting down completely when I’d suggest that maybe reanimating the corpse of Reagan for a 3rd term isn’t the solution to the problems.

        Patriotism ended for me in November 2012, when Obama was re-elected and Lawrence Auster, still just hanging in there at the time, wrote – simply – “it’s their country now.” I haven’t hung a flag on my house since, regarding myself as the subject of an occupying power.Z man is absolutely on target here. Remaining “patriotic” in our time is like clinging to the NFL and buying Mark Levin’s endless series of books on how the Constitution will somehow save us.We’re way beyond that now, like a swimmer who can still see the beach but has been sucked by a rip tide into the open sea. Shouting and waving our arms won’t save us.Anyway, kudos to Z man for pointing out disturbing myth-corpses. I remain skeptical, to put it very politely, given the touchiness of people nowadays, that “we” (undefined term, btw) can rally around a flag of racial solidarity. But this we know: All the chains that get pulled by our rulers have to be broken.One example: the flap over the NA and kneeling. Solution: Drop the NA. Screw it. Let’s quit acting like some point of honor is involved.

        This post-American white nationalism is not some difficult project to get underway, or something that needs to be jump-started in the future. As usual, dig through Sam Francis’s archives and you’ll find he had the best take on this when most of these alt-right types were on their mother’s tit. Francis noted that white flight was originally a neighborhood thing, then a city thing, and a year or two before he passed he noted it was becoming a state thing, that whites were fleeing entire states. Normie whites (like your mainstream conservative friend) and NPR whites (who claim not to see race) are coalescing into a new, predominantly-white nation within America’s borders. My bet is California is completely abandoned by whites first. I could see whites in Dixie refusing to budge/relocate/flee, and I could see some whites in Texas making a last stand, but for the most part I think the future someone like Harold Covington postulated is going to come to pass. White flight is going to be impossible at some point; then we will either have a war or a peaceful secession, but the reality of migratory patterns can only be ignored and done on an informal basis for so long. Everyone from blakety-black con artist Rich Benjamin (look up his book “Searching for Whitopia”) to Gregory Hood (the best of the alt-right writers) knows this is happening.

        You are beginning to understand, but need to go one level deeper again. Core beliefs get “wired” into our brains early in life. This is evolutionary biology, and it’s an immutable trait is fundamental to our species and has helped us survive and thrive for over 200,000 years in an ancestral world of extreme hardship and existential threat. You cannot “talk” adults into changing their brain late in life. You need to start focusing on solving this problem by other means. Talking “better” or “longer” is not the road that takes you where you want to go.

Yeah, that came out of your head. You might want to work on that.
What works is what has always worked in the past (because it’s basic human nature). Mature persons do not change their core habits or beliefs, but they can be motivated to act in self-preservation if the going gets tough and the options get few. The only “plan” is do your best to anticipate future events and concurrently maximize your ability to overcome problems or obstacles.

                        The Declaration did not precede the revolution. As Adams said, the revolution had already occurred years before. We are not there. One can be prepared for the future without predicting it’s form. No one can predict that, and to predict it incorrectly is to be especially unprepared. 1783 left America in an unmanageable state  One thing at a time. First, Reflections for the American Revolution, or the next Federalist Papers.  I can think of someone for that task. Manifestos are for revolutionary minds, and revolutionary minds never tire of being revolutionary.

                            A “Common Sense” for the current state of affairs would be perfect but how to distribute it? Google would shut it down or wall it off in a heart beat. Gab just doesn’t have the user base yet.I haven’t been “flag waver” since the massacre at Waco. I hung in the Constitutionalist crowd for a while but I realized “kumbaya” would never be sung. The final straw for me was the desecration of monuments and the constant humiliation of my heritage. The only white privliege that I enjoy is paying taxes and watching idiots promoted to tick boxes on the diversity list.I will say that white people are waking up, albeit slowly, to the destruction of the history and contributions of their ancestors all while being told they should feel guilty for who they are. Normal folks will eat a shit sandwich for only so long. The pushback is going to be ugly.

        We’re talking revolution here, and there are different ways to justify revolutions. One of the most successful is to do so while insisting that what one is doing is a return to an ancient way of doing things that was good and successful, but has been strayed from. Another is to point out the bankruptcy of the current way of doing things and a proposal for an alternative. That is the kind that usually requires some kind of manifesto.I think that the way most people interpreted the Declaration of Independence was that we had developed on our own beyond the type of citizenship enjoyed by Britons, and that they were denying us our rights as Englishmen in the first place.Most manifestos end up in the trash bin. Look at the Port Huron statement and it’s answer the Sharon statement. Most of the readers here won’t even know what those were.If we want to appeal to normies we need to make them as comfortable as possible while listening to or reading us. Putting our ideas forward as appeals to past authority is a way of doing so.I’ve talked here about the need to tolerate Nazis on the right. We need to find a way to tolerate and turn normies, too.

        “When you point out that the Constitution currently requires Christian bakers to celebrate homosexual weddings, they dismiss this as if it is a lie.”Disagree. Not the Constitution but a majority of the nine Supremes. Same as their decision that the definition of “state” clearly defined in the ACA as, “the fifty states and the District of Columbia” can be “interpreted” to include the federal government. Or the Kelo decision to strip the property rights of one individual in favor of another under eminent domain.There is a convention of states movement afoot to propose amendments. Among those is term limits (12 years) for SCOTUS justices.

        Patriotism is so sharply divided along racial lines that I think it’s not something to overcome, but to lean into. (Granted, I’m more Alt-Lite, I suppose.) I have seen countless (about 10, maybe?) articles recently about how patriotism is white supremacy since Trump attacked the NFL’s National Anthem protests.
The Magical Negro myth needs to be extinguished, but once it is patriotism becomes an asset for survival rather than a liability.

        I think a great deal of a person’s perspective on this nation depends upon where he spends his time and energy, his personal experience.  You live in Baltimore, spend time in the Imperial City, and according to various accounts, your travels primarily take you to Northeastern Liberal cities.I’m not nearly so pessimistic about the nation and it’s future as a nation, partly because my travels don’t focus on the cities, but in their surrounding ‘burbs and rural areas, and even a touch of international travel.Not that this experience makes me believe we are on the verge of some great national awakening/flowering of prosperity and goodwill, just that when I’m not in a college town or cosmopolitan den of iniquity, things don’t look so bad.That includes the relationships between people of different races.  Now, my own history has warped my vision a bit here, as I grew up in an upper middle class melting pot of primarily white and Asian people, with some other hues mixed in between.Work and the desire to find adventure took me to all the biggest, ugliest Progressive experiments in the country – both to live and to engage in commerce – and that added to the variety of people whom I can genuinely call friends.  It’s quite the Rainbow coalition, almost perfectly mirroring the national makeup.And thanks to Faceberg and other sites, I do get to see how we are all getting along into middle age – pretty much all the same stories, same mistakes made and learned from, the wild ones dying off and the mild ones bland and happy.While there are strident voices in both directions, they are the same voices that we laughed at back in school, or cut them off when they got too lippy at the bar, or rolled our eyes at in the classroom/conference room/warehouse/kitchen.  The more things change, yadda yadda yadda.In the new era, where we are yet again stuck between generations far larger than ours fighting over whose future will be implemented, I do see the Jared Taylor message getting more traction, not as ‘white supremacists’, but in his most basic message – leave us the fuck alone.Stop pretending we were the slave masters, the uniquely evil oppressors, those who must be punished.  This is the hopeful message, the future that people can believe in.  America – the idea – is the only nation on earth that can even pretend to offer this future, which is why so many of us are unwilling to give that idea up.We know that the Constitution has been bent, broken, reinterpreted and misrepresented to be used as a cudgel against us.  But just like the ‘pen and phone’ legislating, it can be turned back and reinterpreted back into what we want.  There needs to be some teeth added to ensure that future attempts at violation of it’s core principles and protections are not violated with impunity, which is what comes after Trump, but we realize that the Progressive project took time, and this will require a prolonged struggle as well.And its not just the whites seeing it.  There are a lot of people from many races – most especially the Asians, but the Jews are getting clued in – that the protection of the rights of the individual are far more important to their futures than the promotion of their tribe.The Commies and their ethnic nationalist stormtroopers have overplayed their hands the last 10 years, and are actively making enemies of anyone and everyone who is focused on building the future of their family, and doesn’t reduce themselves to an ethnic heritage.If the Dissident Right wants to have a long term, positive impact, their vision needs to incorporate that large, growing segment of the populace who hate what the nation’s politics has become, and promises a future where race does not work for or against the individual.Voices of nihilism and despair, calling for destruction, seizing power and subjugation based on tribal loyalties that the vast majority do not feel, will only lead to hell on earth.  A shocking number of people are historically illiterate enough to not understand this, but in their guts those same people will not willingly turn on their friends, and certainly not their families, because some asshole named Karl is screaming ‘moar power white brethren, back to the pagan gods of my imagined forefathers’ and trying to destroy that which so many previous generations fought to build.These people know in their hearts that those closest to them are their valued allies, and while that may mean all those allies are the same shade in some neighborhoods, that won’t be the case in the vast majority.  A movement that builds upon that reality, while pushing to fight for a return of all of our individual rights, including that of free association, can succeed.We are seeing the inkling of that happening here, in your blog and elsewhere.  People are not happy to be told what to do and who they are supposed to like/dislike.  They are starting to understand that justice – without modifiers – begins with individual rights and liberties.  And the loudest voices of the strident minority who live and die by their tribal loyalties are being filtered out.

        “Despite the ridiculousness of it, most constitutional conservatives are convinced America is built on Judeo-Christian values.”
Well, if you understand that the Founding Fathers were men of the Enlightenment, and that the Enlightenment was an attempt to make a workable worldly system based on the teachings of Jesus, and that the teachings of Jesus were an attempt to make a workable ethical system based on the teaching of the Jewish Prophets…

And it is guns that stand in the way of pogrom of my race, White Christian Western Men.In fact, I contend guns are all that stands in the way of genocide, which is what the dirty stinking commies are trying to pull on White Men like myself.To me everything else is total bullshit.It all started with guns, what created this country, because what we call the 2nd Amendment is not so much about guns it is where we came from, what we became, how we did this. And it is no different today.No different because my guns are my property, that is the first thing. It is property that protects my property, my life, my loved ones, my belongings, my land, my prosperity, my happiness, it protects my faith too, who I am.Because the dirty stinking commies are the thieves of the human race. They steal, take everything, and are never satisfied, and the only way ultimately you can stop them from larceny is to use your property, your gun.https://mtntopforge.wordpress.com/2017/10/13/never-give-up-your-guns/

            Noted Firearms and Liberty author Kenneth Royce, a.k.a. “Boston Tea Party” to his fans, contends that gun-control laws actually ought to be called “victim disarmament laws,” since that is their actual, intended effect – to deprive would-be victims of violence of the means to protect themselves and their loved ones. This assertion is confirmed in the scholarship of the late Dr. R.J. Rummel, one of the world’s foremost scholars of the history of mass killings, genocide and democide.According to the work of Rummel and his colleagues, any given human being is much more likely to perish at the hands of his own government gone tyrannical than at the hands of a foreign invader. In the twentieth century alone, more than one-hundred million people lost their lives to dictators, tyrants and other violent governments – the regimes of the Ottoman Turks, Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Castro, Hussein, and many more. Bear in mind that 100 million deaths is regarded by most scholars as a conservative figure; the actual total may have been substantially higher.The single thread linking all of these tyrannical governments and leaders was their urge to confiscate firearms and/or other weapons of self-defense from a targeted population prior to preying upon them.Before the Armenian genocide, the Turkish government banned the private ownership of firearms; only a few years later, more than one million Armenian Christians and other minorities were slain during the period c. 1915-1921. Hitler and the Nazis banned most forms of private firearm ownership, as did Stalin and Mao and so many others before setting their murderous purges in action.Kenneth Royce notes that the Swiss have not been conquered or subjugated in centuries, and that there was no Holocaust on Swiss soil during WWII. No Swiss Jew needed to sleep in fear of a pre-dawn raid by the secret police. Why? Because Switzerland is a nation of riflemen. The Swiss know, as all patriotic, traditional Americans ought to – that an unarmed man is a subject, whereas an armed man is a citizen.

        Z, you underestimate the effect of cutting taxes, reducing spending and curbing illegal immigration. If the President is able to frighten Senate and House leaders into repealing/undoing/improving ACA also, he is a shoo in for 2020. Hopefully 2018 with leave some nasty wounds on establishment republicans. Best regards.

            Since none of those things are going to happen under the GOPe regime anyway, I rather wonder what your point is.
Tax cuts and spending reductions motivate exactly no one, and cucks have been harping on that garbage for 50+ years, but I guess we should keep on keepin’ on?

                Africans cannot feed themselves (82% of black households with children are on foodstamps). Like rabbits, frogs, and mosquitoes, the only way to limit their reproduction is to remove their food source. Stop welfare. Stop food stamps. Cut taxes. That will change black reproduction rates.

            Bill Robbins,
The first problem with your goal is that it assumes more than was ever true. The second problem is that it’s populist, mobocratic, and so on. The third problem is that America, an empire of money grubbers, was conceived in egalitarian foolishness, as you can see in the “Creator” clause of the Declaration of Independence.

        I don’t know about others on the Alt-Right, but I found the anti democracy stance of Curtis Yarvin and other reactionaries very difficult to accept.  In hindsight this is simply due to a desire to blame someone else for problems.  We want our freedum, and our free stuff and we want it now.  If we can’t have freedumb, liberty, and free stuff this must be the fault of the commies, nazis, or perhaps the Federal Reserve.The end the FED crowd are an interesting example.  As Zman has mentioned, the FED has done a good job of controlling wage and price inflation while allowing terrible asset bubbles to develop.  This is exactly what we would expect a for profit central bank to do.  Banking is not profitable when inflation exists since debts are repaid with money that is worth less (or worthless), and banking is even less profitable when loans are never repaid due to default.The FED is doing a good job of balancing an unstable situation created by the US Congress.  The US Congress is giving the people all of the fiscal irresponsibility that they demand.  Positive feedback loops are unstable.The myth that America is great because of freedumb and democracy is tough to kill.  The reverse is closer to being true.  A country governed by an accountable hierarchy under rule of law has the conditions under which liberty is possible.  The truth that unlimited democracy is unstable is a tough sell.  Both left and right like free stuff.

            “…The FED is doing a good job of balancing an unstable situation created by the US Congress…”No the FED is doing a good job of routing all the wealth of the country into bankers pockets.They received, we know from Rep. Ron Paul’s forced audit of the FED, $16 trillion during the banking crisis. Estimates of the total amounts a few years ago from looking at financial data is $29 trillion(it’s probably much more). At $29 Trillion and 300 million Americans we could have given a zero interest loan for every family of four of $386,666. Housing crisis solved and the economy would have roared with all that cash going into people’s pockets. What would your family have done with a $386,666 zero interest loan?The FED is a scam of the highest proportions. All money created in this country is created by debt. When the Treasury wants some money they give the FED a bond bearing interest and they “allow” the Treasury to print the money. What does the FED give us in return…nothing. Every last penny in the economy is created with debt so if you pay off the debt, which you can’t, you would have….no money. Total rip off and designed that way.

                You are correct of course.  The FED is inflating asset prices.  The only people who benefit are the 0.1% who own all of the assets.  The thing is that any private central bank acts to maximize profit.  Profit in banking is maximized when loans get paid back with money that is worth something.  The incentive structure for a privately owned bank is actually pretty good.  The underlying reason for the asset inflation and destruction of the middle class is democracy.  Like Zman stated, it is a tough pill to swallow.  If the US congress was forcing USG to run a budget surplus we would not be seeing ZIRP right now.

        The Constitution doesn’t require it. A meat head judicial system does . We’ll see what the present SCOTUS says about it. “When you point out that the Constitution currently requires Christian bakers to celebrate homosexual weddings, they dismiss this as if it is a lie.” It took some convoluted logic from the courts that the Constitution or Federal law require a baker to bake a cake for a gay “wedding”. Where the likes of beck make their mistake is believing the Constitution offers any guarantees or protections. It hasn’t since the Alien and Sedition Act.

        A return to a Constitutional Republic can be a challenge for the faint of heart. Do “We The People” eliminate the income tax? Social Security? Medicare? Medicaid? Do we eliminate public pension funds for retired government and military personnel? Do we return to a currency coined in gold and silver? And when the bloody dust settles, do we establish amendments that “bulletproof” the amendments we want to keep like the Second Amendment, and vote on those we wish to nullify. Once we move from a democracy back to a Constitutional Republic, everyone will have their own interpretation of it. And the move back to a Constitutional Republic will be a bloody ordeal as there are substantial numbers of American that want things to stay the way they are. What America “was” and America “is” are two very distinct entities. You say you want a Revolution? Choose your foreign allies wisely.

            Exactly.Old beliefs are not discarded, they are exchanged for new ones.That happens when having old beliefs causes morality &amp; status damage, but having the new beliefs causes morality &amp; status gains.Engineering that shift is possible, but requires a lot of energy. The tools for applying that energy are the institutions that create the ideas that determine morality &amp; status plus those that disseminate those ideas.In the modern West this means the colleges &amp; the media.This energy can be applied all at once (Germans in Germany, 1930s) or in smaller amounts over longer times (Jews, U.S., 1880-present)

It’s not a dream when it come to that. Lawless leftards have held that the constitution requires, but it does not. The constitution forbids the government from preventing the free exercise of one’s religion, something the leftards can’t stand, so they ignore the part of the 1st amendment that is inconvenient to them.

        You stated, “When you point out that the Constitution currently requires Christian bakers to celebrate homosexual weddings, they dismiss this as if it is a lie.” Please correct me if I’m wrong (chapter and verse, please) but I don’t believe the Constitution provides for this or much else that the courts have suggested, at least not under the doctrine of ‘original intent’, which is, of course, how the Constitution should be interpreted. To the contrary, I believe we have a natural right, protected by the Constitution, to freedom of association, heretical interpretations not with-standing.

        great article! Read Dr Woody Holton’s book UNRULY AMERICANS  and the Origins of the Constitution for the details on why and how the constitution is a sham….the only thing that can save us now is an article 5 convention of the state legislatures…and we are a long long way away from making that possible.
Either that or civil war…

        Dropped it at “fetish” over Constitution. Look, Fella, it’s a fetish to consider a it a fetish for adherence to the one thing that binds us as as a nation. Without that we’re nothing. We’re anything any political party wishes us to be. With it then at least it’s possible to control federal government.

He simply cannot believe anyone would disagree with commenters that agree with you. I read this sort of group think garbage on progressive sites. You speak and write about mindless believers and followers often. Is that sort of thing creeping in here?  Very best regards to you.

        Wow, more BS from the alt-white monkeys. So, ZMoron the Constitution (written by white men BTW) should be shredded, and what should we replace it with? The “ideas” from the alt-white moonshine monkeys? BTW, women’s suffrage and gay “marriage” were not a part of the original Constitution written by the FF’s. I think I would trust the FF’s more than the low-IQ alt-white morons.SO, another titbit from the alt-white. Race is everything. Race over country. Well there are 100% white nations that practice this alt-white credo. Maybe ZMan and his merry bunch of race-obsessed lunatics can move there. Only problem these “nations” (Fmr. Yugoslavia, Hungary, Ukraine) are shitholes that make Mexico look like Switzerland. But they are alt-white paradises and no darkies to spoil the party. So  why don’t you move?America as founded was finished with the 1880-1920 white immigration wave. Income tax, Federal Reserve, Womyn’s voting all started after that. America of 1955 would like 2008 America if not for the Cold War. The Cold War and WWII jus reset the clock by 60 years, but the final result was inevitable when U.S let in whites from Eastern and Southern Europe en-masse. These are the whites that the alt-white losers want to bring in. I say best of luck.The alt-white will never be anything more than a fringe movement of race obsessed kooks and unemployed malcontents. The Trumpian right has a much much better chance

Sorry no.  The Constitution requires that bakers bake cakes for customers.  They need not celebrate their customers events.

                On the subject, though, the Supreme Court has granted cert on the issue and there is a slim chance they’ll say the Constitution doesn’t require Christian bakers to celebrate gay weddings.
Slim, really slim, like no one expects them to make the right call.  But the evil deed has not technically happened yet.

                    The Constitution is an important document, as in “Constitutional Republic” rather than an arbitrary government of individuals or committees, democratic or not.  Yes, it could be improved.  Obama’s recess appointment on the labor board was recently declared unconstitutional by a 6 – 2 SCOTUS ruling, which means he didn’t adhere to the constitution.  But neither did Ginsburg and Sotomayor.  Sad.

                        I, along with practically everyone, if not literally everyone, think you are correct.  I hold out the ever so slightest hope that the facts of this particular case are so incredibly perfect that Kennedy might say as applied the law violates freedom of speech and give a balancing test to see if future fact patterns do so as well.  But my hope is, again, not significantly different from zero from a mathematical perspective.

                No argument here about that.The topic of discussion however goes back to the CRA and civil rights and how the feds get their grubby hands into things our FF’s wouldn’t have dreamed could exist.That said, baking a cake doesn’t celebrate or endorse or promote or acclaim.   It exchanges a product of one’s labor for coin of realm to all comers.How or when or why it is to be used is irrelevant.  To allow this nonsense to stand would mean that any business may decide to question customers about their lives and make decisions on their suitability, etc.There lies more madness than even exists now.

                    No private business owner should be forced to serve any potential customer.  The reason doesn’t matter.  As for the Christian bakers, you don’t get to define what their religious beliefs are or how those beliefs dictate their ethics, they do.

                        Totally disagree.  As the customer, I can pick and choose with whom I wish to do business, but as long as I have a public business, i.e., open to the public, and the customer isn’t doing something illegal or is violent, I believe he or she should be served.

I think your ideals are having trouble finding traction with the people selling you those ideals.

                                    The 1st amendment applies only to government action, not the actions of private entities: this is precisely why the NFL can order players to stand for the Anthem and Google can fire an employee who criticizes diversity’s failure.While it is illegal to post a sign on a business door saying ‘no blacks, jews, gays or women served’ I frequently see sign prohibiting possession of a firearm, which is another constitutional right. Wonder how the SCOTUS would rule on that question?

            “The Constitution requires that bakers bake cakes for customers.”
Yet another of those mysterious “Constitutional Rights” that appeared out of the blue around 1964 or so, doubtlessly hiding in a penumbra somewhere. As I recall, there used to be this thing called “Freedom of Association” and restaurants used to post signs reading “We refuse the right to refuse service to anyone”. Funny how it took 177 years for anyone to notice that was unconstitutional. Ah, the Living Constitution is a rare and wonderous thing…
