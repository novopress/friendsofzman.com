        I’m hardly the first guy to make this comparison, but the mass realization of just how bizarro-world the media really is looks a lot like the advent of the printing press.  All of a sudden, the proles could see that a lot of the stuff “everybody knows” is in the Bible, isn’t; and a whole lot of other stuff nobody knew about, is.  Eventually a critical mass of people start believing their own lying eyes.Which, given the way the Reformation went*, is cause for concern.  130 years of religious wars later, and the very foundations of European life are completely changed.  Peasants’ Wars, Inquisitions, St. Bartholomew’s Days’ Massacres, 30 Years Wars…. nobody can predict exactly what will happen when an entire people realizes it has been lied to for generations, but history suggests it ain’t gonna be good.*In the political history sense only.  No comment on anyone’s doctrines.

        Putting cable on a pay per channel subscription basis would bring that game to a screeching halt. Tim

            I always wanted that, the pay-for-channel. That’s what I always told the minimum wage callers who used to get me to buy their cable packages.  I guess some people have been dropping those bundles though, because a couple of months ago, I heard they were finally going to give pay-by-channel options in my area. This, that I’d been calling companies and communing with telemarketers about over decades, and and when it FINALLY happens, I don’t give a damn any more… I’m an internet fool now, and glad of it.My mate sent me this link because I was hoping mad at the NYT this morning, yelling about how they endorsed HRC just before Iowa caucus, and 20 to 1 NYT readers support Sanders, others saying they’ll vote Trump if that’s the only choice they have in the end.  I was so P.O.d about the timing.  Oh well, time to drop the Times, eh?  It’s the only media I have ever paid money for, and Bernie might be able to use those bucks. I feel a bit freer already.

In Politico Magazine, Tucker Carlson admits that Conservatism, Inc. is incapable of “conserving” so much as a tray of ice cubes, even after countless billions of dollars have been squandered on this racket for half a century now.

        Reminds me ofEl Rushbosrant about CBS hiring Colbert, hip &gt; ratings:“Well, folks!  I mean there you have it!  This is the guy that hired Colbert. (summarized) “The ratings don’t matter.  It’s not nearly the profit center for us it used.  This is about bragging rights.  This is about who appears the smart executive picking the best guy.”  Do I know these people? Do I know this business or do I?He just admitted it.  He said here: “It is not as economically profitable as it used to be.  So they make a lot about the ratings, you know, and that really doesn’t affect the bottom line.” If the ratings don’t affect the bottom line, then what does?Media buzz. PR.If the ratings are not how you’re going to pitch advertisers…  I mean, you still need advertisers, but if the ratings are not how you’re gonna pitch advertisers, what are you gonna pitch?  You’re gonna pitch up “cool,” you’re gonna pitch “hip,” and how you gonna do that?  You’re gonna go to other media and you’re gonna massage ’em and you’re gonna have PR campaigns.There are gonna be countless, endless stories about your talent, your host, and what a cool, hip, in-demand guy he is. And then you’re gonna make sure your host is as visible as possible in cool, hip things and places.  Letterman, of course, doesn’t fit that bill anymore because he’s a recluse.  He doesn’t go to hip places and do hip things. He never did.  Ratings used to matter. Ratings, Lettermen hadn’t had any in I don’t know how long.Leno owned late night and they still got rid of him.  Leno owned it, and they still got rid of him because he wasn’t perceived as cool and hip and young and all that anymore.”

            Limbaugh is part of the problem. He was pitching the Bush Administration as the epitome of conservatism. He used to brag about doing overnight in the Lincoln bedroom. Now all of a sudden he’s Mr. Outsider again.

                Limbaugh has a corner office in Minitrue. He’s also a survivor who probably gets that he wouldn’t look good in tar and feathers.

                You must have listened to a different Rush than the one I used to hear. Don’t recall much braggadocio about how conservative Bush was, rather what I heard was just the opposite. Rush turned rather quickly on Bush when W started consorting with the likes of Teddy “The Swimmer” Kennedy on education.

        “I spent many a night drinking at the pub where the later was founded.”I myself have tipped a glass or three at the Plough. Although it’s been many years since I’ve been to the PRC. Can’t say I miss that town very much.

        I am, as a former newspaper worker, much amused how the electronic media strives to position itself as being ‘clean’ and ‘truthful’ by continually painting the printed word as fantasy and lies. Yet it escapes most people that the same journalists can work for both without changing a shred of their views. If you are in London and work for a left-wing opinion rag like The Guardian then the transition to working for Al-Beeb and peddling the same socialist untruths is merely question of different decor in the office, except now you get to pretend you are honest where your former employer was essentially liars. Better still, the hack can always switch back smoothly if the pay deal is better.Why would anyone go from lies to truth and back to lies? The answer is simply that it is the same clique, the same opinions, with the added bonus that most government is still far more afraid of the printed word than the spoken word. Working for the Graun instead of the BBC means brows area little more furrowed in the corridors power over the lefty lies, and every hack wants to be feared if only because the truth is a lot more difficult to find than airy opinions.

        Yes, you are correct about the changing role of journalism, but certainly even Besos will tire of his rathole rag. Guaranteed.
