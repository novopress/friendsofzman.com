        New to the site and really like the essays. That membership pitch for the WOS could have been a Marine Corps recruitment advertisement. One of the more honest things I’ve read in a while…

        I ride. I could never be a “biker” because I think that Harley’s are overrated POS.
That said, I know a number of 1%ers. None of them are going to win a Nobel Prize (but then again, neither am I – or you) but they are not 85 IQ villains. They’re 100 IQ criminals. They run dope, and they stick together. Irritate one, and be prepared for a beatdown from all.Said beatdown may result in your death, and they don’t care. That’s what makes them criminals. The ONLY think they care about is the club.
