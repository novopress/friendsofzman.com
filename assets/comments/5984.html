        ” “We deserve safe and livable housing.”Affordable? Workers? WIC?OK, what are you going to do to maintain it?I think we’ve seen enough if what happens if someone simply GIVES it to you.The same applies to the “Subsidised” Section 8  housing in “the sticks”

        Bernie never visits the “white slums” in his own state either.  Trashed mobile homes and broken down houses abound here too.  We have the same unemployed and unemployable.

        Unemployed and unemployable. The current administration has no answer for it, other to order such people to live in middle class communities across the nation.  Whether the plan is to lift them up by placing them in a new environment, or to tear down the middle class by introducing extreme poverty into their neighborhoods, I think the result will be the same. Blockbusting on a national scale.  Ol’ Bernie might see a bit of a change up there in Vermont before too long.

        “There has never been a person running for president to come to our neighborhood.”The potential president certainly doesn’t want the people who live there to come to his neighborhood especially if he gets power. He will do all he can to make sure the ruins he sees on his brief visit will never trouble his view again, and better still, he will have armed people standing ready to ensure it will never happen.I have lived in one very poor area of the UK as a kid, and while I dislike socialists intensely, there are still a handful of decent people in the Liebore party who lived among that poverty once, so they have some legitimacy in wanting better housing and opportunities. Of course, the bulk of the socialists have no idea and though they might make a once-in-a-lifetime twenty minute visit to such areas, they really don’t care other than to use it as a soundbite.

        I think Sanders is the appropriate President for the US, he represents the ruling class like no other candidate.

        There are no unemployed in West Baltimore, those are the unemployable, people who have never worked and would not entertain the idea.

        I wouldn’t be so hard on Sanders.  I also grew up in  Brooklyn.  For various reasons, I have been in the middle of the ghettos in  Brooklyn, the Bronx, East St. Louis, and North Philly and have driven through the same bad parts of Baltimore Sanders saw.  I had to go to Camden, NJ yesterday (not the waterfront which has gotten some investment) and was still thrown by it.One thing is that if you can afford not to live in these places, you just don’t go to them unless you have a specific reason, which happens very infrequently.  There is no reason for a politician from Vermont to do so, unless he is either on one of the committees that deal with urban affairs, or is running in the Democratic presidential primaries.
