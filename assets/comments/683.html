        Hey Z–now you know what a mucocele is.  Been there done that.  Congratulations on staying alive.  The biopsy is a bit much though–but it does give you peace of mind, no?  And it underscores an important point.  I myself did not get one, since in the Third World countries where I live, they routinely don’t worry about it, patients don’t care for the extra cost, and I didn’t care either.  But if you want 100% perfect health care rather than 95% perfect health care, you have to pay for it, and as any engineer knows, that extra 5% final perfection can be costly, and in the case of the Western world, 10x more costly than health care in the Third World.  Blog on!
