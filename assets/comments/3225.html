        Bill Cosby and his old show fall into the same category as Duck Dynasty.  The cult would have had you believe the show was popular because he and the cast were black.  In reality, the show was popular across all strata of American culture, because of the shared values that The Huxtable clan had in common with much of America then.
Same thing with Duck Dynasty, A&amp;E sees the popularity of the show and scratches their head and assumes everyone loves redneck culture now.  It’s not that at all, it’s once again the shared values.
Sorry for the tangent there.

        I don’t know enough to say he is or is not what is claimed. The one woman’s story sounds dodgy as hell. If you think you were drugged and raped, you don’t go back to the guy’s house again. If you do, then you either don’t care about being drugged and raped or you think it is worth the price for whatever it is you trying to get from the guy.On the other hand, his willingness to settle with the one woman suggests some guilt. Some anonymous guy without a public image to maintain will settle for expediency sake. Paying off a hustler is cheaper than paying lawyers. A famous guy has different motivations so I suspect she knew things he would rather not have in public.Regardless, the Cult was willing to go to the mattresses for Cosby when they needed him. They did the same for Clinton. Bubba could have been riding interns around the White House lawn and the Cult would have defended him. Like Cosby, Bubba is old and not of much use…

        If we can make room for a Federal holiday over a black Jesus-preacher who screwed more women than Jack Kennedy I guess anything goes, and it has. But drug-raping women is such a white thing.

        I am leaning towards believing the story.  And that right there is the problem.  In our society we almost always believe that a man did rape a woman if she says it happened.  Never mind the many, many fasle assertions of rape it is the crime itself that horrifies us and we automatically choose to side with the accuser.  Is there any chance at all that Cosby will get fairness and justice?   None!  If I were in his position I would say nothing too even if I were 100% innocent.  It is a lose lose position.  What the person in the news business should be asking is why didn’t this lady press charges 30 years ago?  Also after Cosby raped her why did she again go to his home alone?  Neither of these things make any sense at all.
