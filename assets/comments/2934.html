        As a result of the facts not fitting the dogma the Warble Gloamists are now demanding that “deniers” be herded to the wall for summary execution. They frighten me.

        You left out the best part, UKER. The Polar bear climbs the highest piece of ice to better spy where his prey is, the seal. He can swim 100 miles following nothing but his nose.

        I am always amused by the warmist crowd’s belief that Polar bears are about to die out. The odd photoshopped picture of a Polar bear clinging to a rapidly shrinking block of ice at sea underpins their beliefs without question.What makes me smile most is the fact that Polar bears must, if these people believe in evolution, have survived the far warmer periods tens of thousands of years ago. Their shrinking ice didn’t take them to extinction then so why is it doing that now? What is different about this (allegedly) smaller rise in temperatures than the bigger ones that went before?Of course, there is the possibility that Polar bears in fact have sprung into being and thus evolved over the past 20,000 years so were ‘created’ in a colder time not so long ago, in earth’s terms. If the warmists believe that then their ideas of evolution need to be questioned, or they defend it with the belief creatures pop up all the time. If they came from another planet then why haven’t other creatures arrived too?

        You’re right Kathleen. And the sky was falling for about 20,000 years without any help from Exxon or other human activity.Without exception, whenever I ask a Global Warmista: “Approximately how long has the North American glacier been melting?” They haven’t a clue. Most guess 150 or 200 years. If they’ll guess at all.When I tell them it’s been retreating for about 20,000 years, they are astonished.They think I’m making it up, even after I provide the evidence.Since this is clearly well before fossil fuels, power plants, SUVs and Al Gore’s private jet, they can hardly process this information. Most never do.Why this argument is not regularly raised against AGW continues to puzzle me. I suspect that most ‘GW deniers’ don’t know it either.All I ask of the warmists is to sensibly explain the first 20,000  years of ‘naturally caused’ glacial melting before they blame humans for the the last of 150 years of a continuing trend of glacial retreat.Here are some useful AGW debunking links from:Univ. of Colorado, Boulder andOak Ridge National Laboratory:1.

        The sky is falling! The sky is falling! The Climate Commies are still screeching, but fewer and fewer of those who can actually put a couple of brain cells together are buying the whole kit and caboodle. Some are just buying the caboodle and starting to question why the data does not support the theory. They’ll reject the whole kit later, when it is discovered that we are more likely entering a little Ice Age than a long-term warming trend. Which may be a shame because warmer temperatures generally lead to more food production in more regions of the world. More food is better than less food.Funny how you should mention True Believer. I came across that book while in college 25 years ago and it was a game-changer for me. I was a Leftist when I picked it up, but didn’t remain a Leftist afterward. Interesting how today’s Left can’t see itself for what it is: a movement of grasping, hypocritical, power-hungry tyrannical cultists.
