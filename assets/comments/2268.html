        I live at ground zero 1.5 miles from the border.  THE INVASION HAS NEVER BEEN ABOUT SECURING THE BORDER! Scores of inflatablecrafts ARE MET at river’s edge by a border patrol bus/busses–up to 1000 persons per day.  They are being welcomed by fedgov andnumerous churches to be taken to shelters.“Securing the border’ rhetoric is BS!

We are not at war with Islam, we are war with the dual citizen treasonous filth who continually make Islam the enemy.

        For some time now I’ve been saying to friends that we are not only at war with Islam, but approximately fifty percent of our fellow citizens as well. The response is either agreement but with the understanding that we shouldn’t say such things out loud, or my thoughts are derided as being too extreme and even melodramatic. When fifty percent of the voters support the party that is openly trying to subvert our nation while the other political party feigns to stop the subversion, what else am I to think ?

        I notice in these dialogues that the vagaries of actual deportation are rarely or not at all addressed. Are we deporting according to plan, to the extent we can with existing resources? Is there a shortage of planes and buses? Drivers and pilots? What is the “processing” hold up? Why are we more worried about housing and clothing and feeding these people than in getting them back home pronto? Swift and consistent deportations would get people hollering but would stem the tide. Letting the situation ferment and frustrations grow only makes such an approach *less* likely and the anxiety of liberals more acute.These shenanigans are largely predictable, both the “children’s campaign” and the Democrat response. The Stupid Party should have plans A, B and C ready in advance.
