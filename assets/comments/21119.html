        An unexpected trip down south this past week was a pointed reminder just how much more enjoyable spending time surrounded by my Anglo/Scots-Irish brethren is.

            That‚Äôs why I advocate for what I do Brother because living amongst your own kind makes your life a lot better and it gives you the protection you need in case a crisis arises‚Ä¶When more people figure that out well then we will start moving in the direction we want‚Ä¶

        One step forward is to stop emphasizing rights. How about shifing the focus to responsibility and mutual respect? It could undermine the left and increase the appeal of the dissident right.

                    A lot of people value their own comfort more than their children‚Äôs future. Children are a lifestyle accessory and an expense category to them.



Think of the prototypical boomers spending all their legacy on RVs, harleys, les pauls , signed negromabilia for the ‚Äúman cave‚Äù (built to escape nagging second or third wives)‚Ä¶ and of course calling their kids entitled millennials who should work harder at starbucks.



These people would let anything happen their kids rather than face the social problem associated with the scarlet R.

            ‚ÄúRules,‚Äù Raymond,rules. They are how you ‚Äúshift the focus to responsibility and mutual respect‚Äù; they are what you implement to maintain the foundation of ‚Äúa passive ethno-nationalism organized around group identity and rights.‚Äù America stopped enforcing the rules and started creating counterproductive rules (aka ‚Äúlaws‚Äù), both of which undermined our group identity as Americans with rights under the Constitution.Thatdidn‚Äôt work. So now it may be time to try Zman‚Äôs prescription, which bodes pretty well.

                The problems really started when it was decided that breaking the rules was OK if breaking them was associated with some sort of higher calling.  (IMO, it was a bastardization of what it means to be a Christian, but that is a discussion for another day).  Once it was decided to accept that looting, burning, or killing people was acceptable because it was to ‚Äúmake things better‚Äù or it was ‚Äúunderstandable rage‚Äù, things went off the rails.

                                Maybe you‚Äôre projecting how you feel when you‚Äôre concerned about something.I read no fear in NA Vespers post.  I‚Äôm concerned about the future also, mainly because of my grandson and every other young person.  So I should not have had a son, who then had a son?Seems like you try to be the attention whore here.  Lighten up, if you can.

                My wife says this to me on occasion when I bring up the topic of how much of a shit-show the future may well be given all that is going on.When she does that ‚Äì I really have to resist the urge to slap her right across the face.What I usually do is remind her of when her mother was born: 1933. Go look at the damn history. Hitler came into power. There was a worldwide depression. Japan was screwing around with China. Commies were infesting the US. The Soviet Union was jamming people into Gulags.Point here is ‚Äì the world has always been a shitshow. And I remind her of that ‚Äì and then tell her that her crappy attitude is basically making the argument is that her mother should have never been born ‚Äì which would mean SHE shouldn‚Äôt have been born. If you really feel that way ‚Äì go kill yourself and follow thru on your convictions.The short answer is : you have kids because if you don‚Äôt show up for the future ‚Äì somebody else will ‚Äì and that means they ‚Äúwin‚Äù.I say all of this as the 55 year old father ‚Äì of a 21 month old red-haired white son.The last argument is more of an existential one: Because it‚Äôs your obligation as a child of God. I‚Äôve seen a unique argument made by some people much more religious than me in regards to using a gun to defend yourself. Their argument was basically this: God has given you your life ‚Äì it‚Äôs not up to you to decide whether or not to end that life. That‚Äôs why suicide is frowned upon. But it also applies to being attacked by a person who intends on taking your life. It‚Äôs up to you to defend ‚Äì and not accede to the evil of wanting to take another‚Äôs life (in this case ‚Ä¶.. yours).The same logic would apply towards having children: It‚Äôs not up to you to decide your family line is going to end. For 10‚Äôs of thousands of years your forebears have reproduced and have made it so that YOU could exist.It‚Äôs the height of selfishness to decide to not continue that effort just because the future might look a little bit shitty.

                        ‚Äúif a person sincerely believes a hot war is imminent‚ÄùI‚Äôve thought a lot about this too.

If we REALLY thought that we‚Äôd be behaving an awful lot differently (I just bought an expensive new dishwasher, for example). I think the civil war tomorrow thing is basically another LARP.On the other hand a LOT of people believe a hot war is very likelycoming, someday, somewhere. Might be a few years, maybe our lifetime, maybe kids or grandkids lifetime‚Ä¶ Which is, at the level of practice, an entirely different thing.Like living in a coastal area prone to hurricanes vs. knowing one is offshore and projected to landfall in your town.

                            War includes a large component of offensive action which the Right is not prepared for.They are prepared to defend which is half of it I suppose but not a winning strategy long haul against a serious foe.This is a noted flaw in America culture. An Italian Commie , name escapes me once said Americans remnded him of attack dogs, vicious and dangerous at defending their own space but little sense of anything collective or outside that space.Hell half the DR would happily let all the cities fall into ruin and turn the remains into say I dunno a military fort  instead of living in a urban area.As a country boy trapped in suburbia I get it  but its not compatible with other stated goals.We talk about having more kids all the time but once we have numbers they cannot all live in small towns and in the country.You will have cities with all the troubles  associated with them.

                    Congratulations on your little one.  Both my parents were pushing 50 when they had my oldest sibling ‚Äì and it wasn‚Äôt for lack of trying. They were both scout leaders and our dad coached Little League and Pop Warner.  In fact I had plenty of friends whose parents were as old as mine (although they tended to be the younger kids of big Irish families.)

                        Wow . That‚Äôs so gracious of you. But I don‚Äôt consider myself a boomer and I‚Äôm not black.  I‚Äôve said this before ‚Äì but that whole ‚Äúbaby boom generation‚Äù thing has been something the media has been funging with for decades.  Back in the 80s my age group was always referred to as GenX.  Somewhere along the line they started calling us baby boom kids ‚Äì even though we were 20 years out from the end of WW2 ‚Äì and both of my parents were in their single digit years when the war ended.Maybe some of you guys are losing your memories in your advanced years ‚Äì but the kids who grew up in the 70s and 80s shared little to nothing with the kids who grew up in the 50s and 60s (the true ‚Äòbaby boom‚Äô generation kids). By the time I was born ‚Äì the birth rate was already headed down.

                        A Reconquista, yes. The assets can be remodeled.

First, though, we must endure, until the locusts have starved to weakness- as they will.

For example, Zimbabwe: let them starve and murder. That‚Äôs why the Dutch found an empty land in the first place.

The global population has outstripped its food supply.
Can we withdraw, for long enough?

It seems to be a matter of faith for a certain type of defeatist that prosperous educated americans are unwelcome in other countries. A few minutes of research can correct this impression‚Ä¶ but I just wonder if you‚Äôve never even BEEN ANYWHERE or MET ANYONE?


Expats are kind of a thing.


If the horrible part of globalism is that it lets anyone and everyone come here, the slight recompense is that it ALSO makes it easier to go THERE.

                                    Simplified: the best places will never give you citizenship. You might be allowed to stay as a guest but only if you are filthy rich.The so-so places might be ok, and even have a stable (not to say democratic) government and racial mix more to your taste. Even being able to work (legally) will be a major impediment. A lot of assets will help with residency/passport but probably that is out of reach for readers here.The not so nice places are worse than what we already have here. Finally, there is the issue of where do you keep your assets? As a US citizen you are taxed anywhere. It is problematic to find another country to safely store your wealth, especially if you need to keep the US/EU/Interpol/etc. hands out of it. If things get really bad in the USA, it is equally likely that things will fray pretty badly in the periphery too.Unless you are truly a nomad or have close ties to some foreign land, like it or not we are stuck on this roller coaster called the USAüôÅ

                                Same here ‚Äì can trace family back to 100  years before the Revolution.  My grandmother told me that a good part of the family fled to Newfoundland after the revolutionaries won. So apparently most of them were loyalists (but not all).And thru all of those generations ‚Äì the family tree has stayed pretty much ‚Äúclean‚Äù, in that it didn‚Äôt marry too far outside of Anglo-Saxon or French lineage.So there‚Äôs nowhere to go back to.  Great Britain and France have both filled themselves up with interlopers.Maybe Greenland?  Yeah Greenland ‚Äì that‚Äôs it ‚Äì that sounds like a great idea.

Who lives next door?  Are they going to choose to fight with you?  How many of your neighboring families can you trust to fight with you?
Who are you going to fight?  How?  Where?
You need to have plans for this in place and people to carry them out.  Are you doing that?

                                    Fight for what? Until you have a goal, you have no will.You are not fighting for peace and prosperity . You are fighting to live among people with similar customs and ethnicity or optionally in order to take  power to enforce your customs on people.Our side lacks the crucial will to power and until its unfucks itself and say ‚ÄúI want to live in X social  conditions and non cooperators will be expelled, punished or executed as needed.‚Äù it can‚Äôt do anything offensive.Forget your life, forget money , its 100% ideology all the way down and building that future for your people. You may never see it either.As messed up an ideology as it is by our standards The Left including Antifa gets this. That is worthy of respect in my book.

                            At the very least I don‚Äôt see any point in giving the people who engage in defeatist thinking a free pass by not saying anything.And all of the suggestions about forming a new country in the Midwest, running away to places like Greenland or upper Canada ‚Äì or emigrating to some unnamed magical country where whitey can live in peace ‚Äì deserve to be called out for idiocy that they are.Magical thinking will NOT solve the problem.

‚ÄùIf YOU live someplace like Lagos, MD, St. Louis, NYC or Los Angeles there aren‚Äôt enough of YOU to make THEM leave‚Äù

If by YOU you mean whites there‚Äôs WAY MORE than enough of us to make them leave. There‚Äôs not enough will and there‚Äôs too many of us on the other side.

White South Africans could absolutely deport or exterminate every black there, huge numbers of low IQ disorganized people are not a threat. The problem is the opposition from whites elsewhere and lack of unity within.

Ok now I‚Äôm confused‚Ä¶ should we stay and fight because we can win, or run because we‚Äôre going to lose.
You seem to be advocating stay and fight SO we can lose and that doesn‚Äôt compute as a strategy for people interested in their racial OR individual family survival.

                        You need an ocean, bubba. Trade for commodities is a necessary thang, and the intermountain west lacks an ocean. The US south will be Mexico-Honduras soon enough, and it doesn‚Äôt have enough fresh water or arable land. We need the top third of the US from Maine to Alaska joined with Alberta and then we‚Äôll have a sustainable homeland. Blacks are already self-deporting up there and heading to the warmer climes. You may not have received the news but we who live up here hear about this ‚Äúcrisis of fleeing blacks‚Äù (oh no! we must be doing something wrong!) and our nipples get hard they are doing the heavy lifting for us.

I‚Äôm all for merging US and Canadian Whites but the most problematic parts of Canada are in the East within 200 miles of the US border (something like 80% of Canada‚Äôs population).
The wild portions along the NE border, above the UP of Michigan and all the way West are prime territory for Our Guys.

Like Masonic enclaves.  They wait, holding the sciences of rebuild, for civilization to fall again.  That‚Äôs the meaning of the Architect‚Äôs tools, their symbol.
Right now, we‚Äôre dealing as a people with massive non-White overpopulation.  Their growth and global hypermobility are all due to means White men created.
Enclaves may be the best we can do, for now, until the Crash.

                    If you really believe in the doomsday scenarios for the US and/or western Europe you should be looking into eastern europe for long term settling, or asia/south america to hide out for a few years.

This is obviously much easier for those with means, but anyone sufficiently determined could make it happen.

I don‚Äôt think most people predicting civil war any day now REALLY believe it though, this is becoming the right wing version of saying you want your kid in a diverse school.

                    Amen Moss. I pray that I will find my gifts to share with my community but nothing will make up for the fact that I never had children. The malthusian doomsdayers need not apply. They have done enough damage. All my one-and-done friends have lots of nice things and many view their kids as one more extension of that. Its sad. But also one of many aspects of a toxic landscape and broken communities. I just got back from riding horses with my niece and nephew through high sage brush and pine trees. Simple beauty all around. When people complain of the complexity and burdens of a big family, they have just lost touch with so many things that actually matter that pretty much any substantial change toward those things in our blood we have lost will reveal those truths. Modernity is full of traps such that those small moves seem impossible.

Some lessons are better learned from trusted men, NOT their father.You probably make for an epic Uncle. Good on you. Your gift and investment in those kids will become part of the character fabric of their life. That position, cherished Uncle, is vital to the strength of a stable, healthy family.I lost my brother to leukemia 15 years ago. I miss him regularly and see him in my oldest son.

        The phrase ‚Äúall men are created equal‚Äù refers (as I understand it) to the individual‚Äôs moral or spiritual worth and their standing before the law. The authors never intended the phrase to mean ‚Äúall men have exactly the same talents and abilities,‚Äù much less that ‚Äúeveryone has to have the same positive outcome‚Äù ‚Äî which is what the phrase has been twisted to mean these days.The obvious fact is, men have different talents, different characters, different goals ‚Äìso outcomes will always be different. If the differences in talent and skills are race-based to some extent, well, that is just how it is. I accept that I will never be a world class marathon runner because of my genetic makeup. Other groups have to accept (contrary to progressive dogma) that they will never produce large numbers of nuclear physicists or rocket scientists. The lie that everyone has a right to expect equal outcomes has defined the last century, We absolutely have to get beyond it as a nation or we are doomed.

            We are presumed equal at birth and thereafter facts and law will tend to demonstrate various inequalities that play out over time, some sooner and some later.The logic flaw in the enemy‚Äôs ‚Äúreligion‚Äù is they truly believe equality must persist throughout an individual‚Äôs lifetime. It does not, clearly.I used to be enabled to bench press well more than three-hundred pounds. Today I am over age fifty and can manage a bit more than half that weight in the bench press. I have demonstrably declined and, yet, following the enemy‚Äôs religion a strapping twenty-year old, if they still exist, should be hectored and loaded with Harrison Bergeron weights to prevent him from embarrassing me in a weightlifting competition that I have no business competing in due to my limitations. This is what they demand, and it is a religion.

        This may prove to be easiest in Europe, as Europeans have a genuine conservatism in their past they can pull out of storage.And because we have proportional representation. If you get 2-5% of the vote, nationwide, congratulations, you‚Äôre in parliament.My problem is this: there have been plenty of non-con alternatives in Europe already, but every time they‚Äôre voted within striking range of real power, they are subverted by the globalists. Examples are: The Danish People‚Äôs Party, The Norwegian Progress Party, the Sweden Democrats, UKIP and Front National ‚Äì and those are just the one‚Äôs I‚Äôm sure about.How would you avoid that this happened to /ourparty/?

            Sam Francis wrote about this exact problem. Pat Buchanan has also written on the subject. In the case of Francis, he pointed out in the 1970‚Äôs that conservatism was doomed as soon as it engaged in the political system. The reason is it had to first accept not only the rules, but the rule maker. The Buckleyites would be condemned to constantly updating their views in order to remain in the system.It is one reason I advocate forming local in-person groups. Politics for dissidents is about building entryways to this side of the great divide. any engagement in conventional politics should be limited to recruitment.

        Sitting with my wife‚Äôs family and thinking that maybe it‚Äôd be best if Biden won; that why, maybe they‚Äôd FINALLY shut the hell up about Trump. It‚Äôs like this weird status signifier: who can think up the snarkiest thing to say about Orange Man? It‚Äôs all just so, so tiresome. Yeah, let‚Äôs shit on Trump, but let‚Äôs completely ignore the fact that the left has orchestrated an attempted coup, supports the normalization of having sex with kids, and is committing elder abuse by electing an actual dementia patient. Don‚Äôt those things constitute a far greater threat to the integrity of our democracy than Trump?Since the arrival of my son, I find myself becoming more and more apolitical. Most of Trump‚Äôs sins, at least directly, are political. But the left are completely out of control.

            I have those feelings too, at times.  Not over a Biden win per say.  Just with all of it.  The constant conflict is mind boggling.  It just beats you down.  Lefty has all the neurotic energy of a hungry rat.  I can‚Äôt keep up.

            The document is a list of legal transgressions committed by the King and made the case as to why this constituted the grounds for severing ties.  The ‚Äúall men are created equal‚Äù phrase was meant to distill the arguments that would follow into a simple statement.  Jefferson was referencing the equality the colonists had a right to expect as subjects of the king.

                Yes, I‚Äôve understood that phrase to be the explicit rejection of the Divine Right claimed by nobility and that the author was asserting that this claim was unjust and made invalid by the gross injustices inflicted by the noble upon the common. It‚Äôs a statement that indicates that our new nation will consider all men equal before the law and God, with no special privileges by birth invoked to settle disputes.  It‚Äôs aspirational rather than practical in many ways, as we know, since money and power move to create rank and with it, privilege, and therefore as a practical, special rights.  It‚Äôs human nature.  Things eventually devolve into ‚ÄúSome animals are more equal than others‚Äù given enough time.

        Evolution precedes biology, and by extension, everything else. What this means is that we are adapting to the modern world of affluence and post existential hardship and threat. Instead of a natural environment that culls the herd of the stupid and weak, we now live in an artificial environment that promotes parasitism, obesity, and hive-minded conformity. We are devolving into an insect-like species. And a newfangled political philosophy is not going to cure that.

            evolution is imaginary doctrine of prometheans, if you mean to say adaptation then sure, living organisms can adapt to all sorts of conditions.Robots functions like insects, that is true, this is what elites promote, but humans stay the same, no evolution there.The fact that enlightenment failed to change man into an atheistic drone makes them hate us even more. Now they want to fry our brains with chips(chips will induce pain into human brain if you do not submit) &amp; vaccinate us into oblivion.

            That world is built upon massive amounts of ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù and printed money though.So it‚Äôs a world built on financial quicksand.It‚Äôs also built on ‚Äúeasy‚Äù energy.  If peak oil really is a thing (I‚Äôm not sure that it is) ‚Äì then much of the modern world may be on the verge of disappearing.Much of the incentive behind locking everybody down because of the corona virus ‚Äì seems to be coming from elite elements who want to push the whole ‚Äúgreen society‚Äù agenda.People like Kunstler are claiming that the modern world is on the verge of collapse ‚Äì and we‚Äôre going to go back to something more akin to the way life was lived in the 1800s.  There will be a certain level of technology , but not all of the mass production and shipping shit over from China that we see now. He calls it ‚Äúa world made by hand‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt know if I believe him ‚Äì but that viewpoint is definitely out there.This modern world you refer to hasn‚Äôt really been around all that long.  Definitely not long enough to have affected evolution.  We‚Äôre dealing with a mindset problem -not an evolutionary change.We live in a society that has had a ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù set of laws applied over it that ENFORCE ‚Äúsafety‚Äù.  Seatbelt laws, car seats, air bags, OSHA laws, emissions laws ‚Äì etc.  The list is endless and is something I recognized 30 years ago as an increasing problem because it requires tyranny to really enforce reliably.

                peak oil is made up nonsense.  find the earliest mention in the press, then find all the new oil fields found since then.  then add in fracking.  did you know that traditional oil pumping only reaches the easiest 1/3 of oil, in a given field?  the world will be running on nuclear energy before oil runs out.key point is energy density.  how many pounds of oil, does it take to match the energy in one pound of uranium?  2m.  that‚Äôs right, uranium is two million times as energy dense as oil.  and that‚Äôs also why climate alarmism is so nonsensical.

                I have disagreements with Greg Johnson, but he is absolutely correct on his central point: the case for Whites is amoralone. This isn‚Äôt to say a post-United States America will be achieved without conflict, possibly violent because communists don‚Äôt cede territory passively, but your point that it cannot be endless conflicts with others is well-taken.The Whites‚Äô state-sanctioned enemies have made the moral case. Each burning, each beating, each murder, while so-called law enforcement has sided with the criminals, has shown this is a moral case. This is not an argument for submission to violence, but using what is happening to establish a moral case. First we have to win our own, and the violence against us will help in that regard.The next step will be explaining the only solution to violence and cultural degradation is separation from the Empire.

                    I think some of the components of a moral case are right out there in the open now.The BLM/Antifah crowd has been making their argument about ‚Äúblack lives matter‚Äù using a laundry list of criminals as their martyrs of choice.And they‚Äôve been rioting and burning and looting, all with the acquiescence of a good part of the power structure ‚Äì because they would like you to think that we‚Äôve finally reached some historical inflection point where they can make the moral argument that whitey has been oppressing blackie ‚Äì and it has to stop.If you look at the actual facts ‚Äì their moral argument completely falls apart, but the trendline doesn‚Äôt seem to be interested at all in actual facts and figures about where the real problem lies.So they‚Äôve been getting away with this for months now ‚Äì and nothing seems to stand in their way.Until a 5 year old kid named Cannon got shot in the back of the head.We just got given a ‚Äúgift‚Äù  ‚Äì named Cannon.I think one measure of how much of a failure opposition to the left wing has been ‚Äì is that this kid should be getting shoved right down the throat of anybody who is trying to echo ANY arguments made by the BLM crowd ‚Äì or the left in general.If no forceful political response to the excesses and demands of the left can come out of an incident like that ‚Äì what the hell is it going to take?

                It‚Äôs the borders part where the rubber meets the road ‚Äì and where various versions of conflict could arise. That said, many communities already have carved out parts of cities for themselves without much or any violence.Regardless, the path forward seems clear:Normalize and then legalize freedom of association for Whites (everybody else already has this)Form White communities, political groups, cultural groups, schools, etc.Gain more and more political autonomyHomelandIf I live to see steps 1 and 2, I‚Äôd be very happy and, frankly surprised, i.e. this is a very, very long process. In my lifetime, I‚Äôd shoot for increasing our numbers and moving a long way toward achieving step 1. But that doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt form small-scale communities during that time.

                    Ultimately the way things are configured, a genocidal multi-ethnic political war is inevitable. There are very few ways if any to split FUSA into contiguous States that don‚Äôt involve pogrom.And there‚Äôs the difficulty, maybe the intractable difficulty.  Everybody likes to draw up fantasy maps, but the cultures are too well mixed everywhere.  And, you know ‚Ä¶ if you plot everyone on a frequency distribution over intelligence, or industriousness, or the willingness to regard the other guy‚Äôs stuff as his, you get these normal distributions.  Bell curves.  The negroes are shifted to the left of the whites by a standard deviation, but that means there‚Äôs still plenty of overlap.  I doubt that I‚Äôm unique in knowing a couple of smart, law-abiding, cooperative, lovely people who are also negroes.  They aren‚Äôt doing crime, they‚Äôre long-time married, they‚Äôre raising kids with love and discipline, they don‚Äôt talk ebonic ‚Ä¶ for all intents and purposes, they‚Äôre white people with really dark suntans.  Is Whitopia to be closed to them?  Do we want to force them to live in the jungle?  Contrariwise, their children ‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs nature as well as nurture, and some reversion to the mean must be expected.And on the other side of the coin, well, we‚Äôve all seen the video from Seattle and Portland.  Stupid, violent whites that we‚Äôd definitely want to keep out of Whitopia.  (On second thought, if Whitopia is properly run, maybe no big harm in some murderous trannies being there to begin with, as their life expectancies would be extremely short.)But you see what I mean.  I‚Äôm all on board with Whitopia.  But there are complications.

                        There are complications. We are so far away from Whitopia that it‚Äôs almost futile to talk about it in any detail. The battle at this point is one mind at a time. Adam Haner, the white man who got knocked out in Portland with a sucker kick to the head by a vicious spear administrator who was wearing a ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù t-shirt has regained consciousness after two days in a coma and says that he had marched with BLM in the past. He says he‚Äôs not seeking vengeance for the attack and is leaving it to ‚Äúkarma‚Äù to set things right. Yet he is also saying that he is sure that he was attackedbecausehe was white. You see how this works. Thatbecauseis a victory.Haner says he hopes that his assailant ‚Äúlearned something‚Äù from the episode. Wow, is he in for a surprise when he finds out he‚Äôs the one who has to do the learning.https://www.amren.com/news/2020/08/portland-driver-adam-haner-believes-he-was-attacked-because-he-is-white/

                        IMO, the answer is that we have a set of standards in Whitopia, disparate impact is protected constitutionally, and people who adhere to those standards for a number of years can become citizens.
Their children will revert to the mean, but it shouldn‚Äôt be a huge shift, and we‚Äôll filter out the worst by the initial denial of citizenship to people who fail to meet our standards.

                    I have to disagree. Its not first gen immigrants that cause problems. Not even the illegal ones really. The massive damage is inflicted by their children. Devoid of any real roots of their own, second generation immigrants (and mixed race people) are the perfect communists, literally shorn of their nations and and left economic units.Its no wonder many end up like African Americans with racial grievances instead of a cultural history and degenerate consumerism as a replacement for self expression. The only identity possible is negative.We can have immigrants but they must go back within their lifetimes and citizenship must be determined by blood.

                        It‚Äôs an academic question at this point ‚Äì we‚Äôre decades short of being able to enforce these kinds of policies ‚Äì but the thing to keep in mind is that we don‚Äôt need immigrants who stay for decades. Short-term for things like tourism and legitimate cultural contact yes, but unless someone is marrying a citizen, there just isn‚Äôt a need or a compelling interest in allowing any kind of long-term immigration.In the short-mid-term we‚Äôre going to have to accommodate the rainbow-poz cities and tolerate more mixing at the fringes because we don‚Äôt have the power to say otherwise.For now focus on developing White core areas that will be the nuclei for a network we can build out from.

Physically investing in White communities, yes! But also the language and pride of culture. We must begin pressing back on those around us that are actively and passively destroying White individuals. We‚Äôve given up too much ground in language, culture, etc.
Building in the physical realm is certainly key. But we can begin right this minute to begin training ourselves to think White, speak White, dream White, and love White!

                            Yep, I think these are all interesting things to argue over but people in this thread are gettingwayout ahead of themselves.We‚Äôve got a whole civilization to rebuild and we need (sorry for the corp-speak) a core team for that project.  Right now, whites themselves are the biggest problem, or rather I should say GoodWhites.  Before we start any pogroms against other groups we need to (re)develop our own core tribal group and values. We need to start our own march through the institutions and begin to un-person and remove GoodWhites wherever we find them.  Everyone who knows ‚Äúa few guys‚Äù at work who are wrongthinkers should start their own little ‚Äúsecret revolutionary committee‚Äù at their company.  Leftists should be identified and kept track of.  Possible recruits for Our Thing also should be followed up.  I know this sounds awful but the Left itself used these tactics to subvert our institutions in the first place.  They should not be immune to having their own tactics used against them.

                        Its not first gen immigrants that cause problems‚Ä¶The massive damage is inflicted by their children.Exactly. A person who immigrates as an adult knows who and what he is and views the new society as an outside observer, just as a tourist would. But the children grow up in and really only know the new society. Unlike the first generation immigrant, they are in some ways part of the new society but are still alienated from it.It used to be popular to say immigrants are OK so long as they assimilate. Now, when they assimilate they are assimilating our society‚Äôs anti-white grievance values.

                            The eternal magic  buzzword of ‚Äòassimilation.‚Äô  Historically this was achieved by killing off the men and breeding with the local women (proven by numerous genetic studies).  Today, the Mohammedan neighbor who wears jeans and eats pizza is termed assimilated.  So, too, Jewish neighbors who even have a Christmas tree.  And Chinese friends are so nice, they go to church (a Chinese one, of course) and speak accent-free English.  Genuine modern-day assimilation means generations of adaptation and intermarriage.  Instead of numericans, the result isalwayssome new melange.

                        I‚Äôll add my 2 cents. I‚Äôm half Mestizo or 75%+ white ala a 39 year old Nick Fluentes type and I think there are several factors on which side mixed race people go towards.A father in home make big difference in life and outcomes and political outlook.My parents were silent generation so my outlook is more conservation other mixed race individuals so think the tendency towards the left is because immigrants tend left.I look very white and  Z-Man is right. It is a Skins game and the more white looking a mixed person is the more likely they are go right unless they have specific incentives to go the extreme other end ala the Liz Warren Indian effect. BLM wouldn‚Äôt think twice about lynching me as a ‚Äúwhite man‚Äù and at the end of the day that is what all of this come down to no matter your 23andme says.

                            Racial purity in America is rare and unworkable. Our game is a skins game with a link to demonstrated group tendencies. I am effed in a sense. My genetic tests, under an alias through legal counsel, prove I am soley of N‚Äôwest European biology. My name, however, is highly ethnic Caucasian as in from the Caucasus Mountains and a race as dark in general as the Kardashians (hint). I am a bastard, which everybody including me knew when I was very young. I screwed up the courage to ask mom when I was ten and we both knew she was lying to me. My thin Trumpian blonde hair and deep blue eyes just don‚Äôt occur in that race with frequency and their genes tend to dominate my actual European ones. (I came to love that race even though we are known as the ones who can out jew a jew. This doesn‚Äôt come naturally to me but I have learned how to do that, actually, and I have successful practice.) In any event I belong with fellow whites despite the name and cultural familiarity.

                        Strongly disagree.  Any generation immigrants are a problem (legal or illegal is yet another shell game; I‚Äôve been a visa officer and about 95% of those who are ‚Äòlegal‚Äô became so via illegal means and talmudstry).  They come not for ‚Äòmuh freedumbs‚Äô but formoney and stuff.There is no skill, no talent, no ability, available out among the world that we cannot provide for ourselves.

                    It is always going to be risky, but diversity should be like spices ‚Äì enough to add flavor, but not enough to overpower.  In other words, limits.I don‚Äôt see why, if we had country immigration quotas in the past, we can‚Äôt have them now.  It is really about the will to enforce it.  But, my solution would simply be freedom of association.  If you want a white bread mayonnaise sandwich town, you are free to have it.  If you want the curry with one pepper, fine.  If you want the five pepper curry, go for it.  And let nature do its thing.

                    Look around the US. Mostly, the only gringos who exhibit any racial solidarity in voting are those who live with blacks. Whitopian gringos are nearly universally clueless moderates or progressives. OTOH in Texas, Mississippi, etc whitey votes whitey 70%+. Doesnt this suggest that whitey is too dumb to live in utopia? Or, to be fair, a utopia whose media messaging is nearly universally universal, equalitarian, civnat, and anti-white?

                            I think you‚Äôre correct on that.  But that points to white men not being able to control their women.

If you can get your mind right about women,  then you can get your mind right about a lot of other things.

                        I‚Äôve always wondered about this. I suppose in Whiteopia, it‚Äôs easier to buy into the progressive narrative and assume real blacks are like the ones you see on TV. But what about places outside of the Deep South where there are a lot of blacks? Is it that the blacks are concentrated in the cities  so that the whites in more rural areas aren‚Äôt exposed to blacks very much?

                            Those blacks can defend themselves from other hordes of their own kin, it‚Äôs not whites who‚Äôll bother them. Whites will leave them alone, they have the right to live a segregated life from whites(same applies to whites who wanna separate from blacks) &amp; take care of themselves &amp; their own families.Basically every race has the right to self governate.

                            Its the ‚Äúgrains versus pile‚Äù thing.  At some indeterminate point, ‚Äúspice‚Äù becomes permanent low level war with constant policing and vigilance. We have learned that coexistence with piles of sand means NKVD/CNT-FAI levels of violent, controlling retribution, or failing to keep that exhausting level of violence, 80,000+ of our women get raped by them every year and our cities get burned down every decade.  That‚Äôs not a great choice.  If ‚Äúspice‚Äù is eventually allowed, it must be so minute and controlled that the grains of sand never become a pile of sand, because the only solution then is horrific.

                    Doesn‚Äôt work in democratic societies (or even democratic republics), especially with universal voting franchise.
For it to work under a voting scheme, tiered voting would be best, but no guarantee. With technology, tiered voting should be doable.
Basic, local and limited voting‚Ä¶ like for city ordinances governing waste removal or zoning‚Ä¶ could be open to all living in the area. Leadership and representative voting could be limited to people conferred membership by the community. A different tier for higher office voting, etc.

                        There‚Äôs two sides to the voting problem. One is who you let vote ‚Äì and the other is what they are voting for.If you look at what the vast majority of people who are destroying the nation are voting for ‚Äì it‚Äôs more ‚Äúfree shit‚ÄùAnd I say ‚Äúfree shit‚Äù in all of it‚Äôs possible permutations.  For women it‚Äôs free abortion and child care and job preferences. For blacks it‚Äôs welfare and job preferences and pretty much anything ‚Äúfree‚Äù.  For Jews it‚Äôs more foreign aid for Israel ‚Äì and laws against their prosecution for acting like enemy agents.  For a good amount of ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù ‚Äì it‚Äôs for endless wars overseas paid for by borrowed money and the blood of somebody else‚Äôs kids.It is my opinion that a true white man‚Äôs society or nation simply doesn‚Äôt need to funnel that much money thru the hands of ANY governmental agency.  Once you start putting any form of government ‚Äì the push for more voting rights will start.  But it can work the opposite way as well.  Enhancement of voting rights ‚Äì leads to a push to funnel more $$ thru the government.  It‚Äôs a two-sided dance into disaster.The discipline of a TRUE conservative ‚Äì would be to just say NO.  NO. NO. NO.  We simply will NOT do it.  You must find another solution to your claims that we ‚Äúmust do something‚Äù.

                This is how I‚Äôd do it.Rule one,There will very few  new immigrants.  The highest that makes sense is about 1/1000th of the population so place like I dunno Colorado Springs might have 400 immigrants and say Phoenix might have 1600 or so in the entire city.   It will be point based with White and Right getting the highest pointsSecond, if you act and look White, no one cares about the odd Hispanic, Amerind, Asian or whatever it the muddy US  gene pool.  The old paper bag test should be sufficient.Third, if we allow non Whites in DR territory, they will be Right Wing and vetted. Maybe we‚Äôd like Sheriff  Clarke or Candace Owens  or the like as citizens but its a White country, run by White rules for White people. Numbers will be no more than 10% tops, the lower the better.Fourth.  No birthright citizenship except for someone born  to 2 citizen parents and who claims no other citizenship. Otherwise custody defaults to the non citizen parent though extra points should applied if they wish to become a US citizen.  Any other citizenship or nationality Wokeland, Israel , UK anywhere means immediate loss of citizenship.That should cover most issues I think.

                I could accept up to 5% minorities, but no blacks, no Moslems, and perhaps no Jews. In such a scenario, minority couples would not be allowed to have more than two children. Breaking that rule would result in immediate expulsion from Whiteland.

                            I don‚Äôt care. Nobody gets to do that.If we can‚Äôt get our people to have kids in a environment set up for it and where we are overwhelmingly in the majority but others are having babies than we deserve extinction.Besides a lot of putative White people have a bit of other anyway. I don‚Äôt give a fig about some guy who is 1/4 Indio, 1/4 Ute or 1/16 Japanese. I don‚Äôt really care about the errant passing Octoroon that slips through and is not subverting our society for that matter.This is as much tribal as anything.I‚Äôm not DNA testing people and if you say your are White , look and act White than you are White.Amusingly Stormfront rules.The settles the ‚ÄúWhat about me I‚Äôm part blah.‚Äù problem as well.Would you tell say Vox Day who is absolutely on our team he can‚Äôt live there. He‚Äôs part Mexican and Amerind but unless he said so you‚Äôd never know.How about Nick Fuentes who is part Mexican for example?Its still a White country but its not perfect and it maybe a bit muddier. This is just fine so long as it works.That said if you want a nation where everyone is DNA tested and can make your own work, zero reasons DUSA and WNUSA can‚Äôt get along.

        Buckleyite Conservatism is a failed ideology, in many ways more discredited than communism if that is even possible. It muddled along as long as it did because it was seen as the only alternative to Marxism/Progressivism. As you point out, its failure was baked into the cake. People only recently caught onto the fact that Buckleyite Conservatism was a slow motion form of Progressivism.There is a huge, yawning gap between Americans and the United States as it exists today. Americans don‚Äôt have to really jettison their history so much as make certain they survive as a people. Our culture and history and traditions need to be maintained, but under a system that will allow it. Obviously the totalitarian State that now exists and is expanding out of control will not permit us to exist as a people. Passive ethnonationalism is the key to victory. I thoroughly agree with Greg Johnson that we have to make the point that this is amoralissue for Whites. Ade factoethnostate is possible. The Amish already have one, and while reservations obviously are horrible, so do Indian tribes.As I‚Äôve previously written, there really is only one sound reason to vote for Trump‚Äôs re-election and that is it will lead to the Left dropping all pretense and not honoring or trying to overturn the results. Trump very well may lose, but the only way to demonstrate the system is totally illegitimate is for him to win and have the results ignored. The failed coup already demonstrated as much but it was a bit too subtle for most Americans to realize what it represented. With any luck, sections of the Left would secede rather than acknowledge the results. This is the only semi-peaceful solution.

            I once saw Buckley throw a debate against Galbraith in the early 90s.  I was right there in the auditorium.  One of my first political experiences as a teenager.  And I knew then that Buckley was a Huckster.  A primordial version of some of the ones we have today.  His son Christopher, a lib, wrote ‚ÄúThank you for Smoking,‚Äù   one of the most cynical and entertaining pieces of literature in the last 30 years.  Where did he get this cynicism?  Perhaps watching his grifter father pay the mortgage?

        I just don‚Äôt know if we featherless bipeds can make nationalism work without having some sort of metaphysical belief tagged along to it.  Blood and soil sounds great but when combined with high explosives, we get 20th century round two.  Zman is correct that ethics and respect are the groundings for this New Theory but I don‚Äôt know if you can get to ethics and respect logically, by reason alone.  There‚Äôs a reason for Throne and Altar when we get down to it.
At any rate, the religious are the ones breeding in whitelands so this problem might solve itself‚Ä¶.

            Do we have data on how many people raised evangelical / trad cath actually stay conservative and don‚Äôt get pozzed?
Evangelicals might have an average of 2.5 children but if only 50% stay that‚Äôs essentially a fertility rate of 1.25 basically the same as liberals.
Anyways I never felt like evangelicals are going to fight for anything. Mostly good people with good values but they‚Äôre just going to be praying to Jeebus no matter who is in charge.
Most of ‚Äúthe right‚Äù are followers like that ‚Äì we need leaders.

                The Evangelical movement may have collapsedFrom what I hear its  fertility is not much higher than secular these days and retention is pretty low.The LDS are doing not much better.The only groups that do well are those that have elaborate customs to keep themselves away from modernity. Amish, Orthodox Jews and the like.Modernity must go in order for a property society but I don‚Äôt know how, other than a spate of barbarism or a collapse  to deal it out of the picture.And note to Space Bugs and Elon will Save Us types. Nope. You can rockets or children not both. Our TFR was at end game levels by 1973, a mere four years after the moonwalk , its related to modernity which is required for space.

            That‚Äôs why I‚Äôd like to appreciate, yet distance myself, from a certain Book.They were talking abouttheirPeople, the ‚Äúsons of Adam‚Äù, not all humankind.TheirGod,theirpantheon, the elohim (the gods, -im is plural), as supreme above the invaders.They were dealing with the same problem as we are, but with a major difference.We were the invaders, and superior to them. Our cosmological speculation was that of engineers, as in ‚Äúhow did it begin? How does it work? What are the stars?‚ÄùThey were and are second-raters; their cosmological model is that of chastised women or children, ‚Äúwhat did we do wrong? How do we win Daddy‚Äôs favor?‚ÄùAn emotional, hindbrain based model that gives the edge in matters social.Thus, they selected for cushy HR jobs in the preisthood, or seeking nomadic merchantry and independence, grinding with resentment when they had to labor for bread from those above.In the priesthood, their elites merged our cosmological query with their children‚Äôs morality and superhero tales, elevating emotion over ability.I‚Äôd like to turn those tables, lifting function to the equal of feeling.We are hobbled, in insisting thattheirWord is the final word.

        The frontier is the key.The whole structure of US history is rotten. The shining city on the hill is literally Puritanism. Fine, they are Americans too, but American history should emphasize they got here SECOND. America was founded at Jamestown. We have forgotten that after decades of Yankee control. Massachusetts not only won, they took sole ownership of America‚Äôs founding.Any rescue of the American people has to emphasize the men of Virginia, not Plymouth and definitely no William Penn‚Äôs followers. That way is invade the world, invite the world theology. Of course, you must side step the Lockean obsession with property within the South‚Äôs plantation dominated elite.Old America was obsessed with the Western precisely because they remembered settling the America.

Yes, the fighting kicked off in the Commonwealth, but when it came to representation in the Continental Congress(es) PA sent the most reps, followed by VA, SC, NJ and then MA. Regarding religion Anglicans dominated, followed by  various Protestant denominations, nonconformists, and Roman Catholics.

        The problem with rejecting universalism and egalitarianism is a free rider issue.  Only about 5-10% of the population drives the entire population forward.  The human race was designed to be mostly followers.  You can‚Äôt build any society at all if everyone is an aspiring warlord.  Even in a population that‚Äôs exclusively white, this would still be the case, with the vast majority watching TicToc videos while a small subset runs the place.  Embedded in human nature is the desire to be a free rider.  To expend minimal energy for maximum payoff.  Universalism and egalitarianism are phenomenal free rider transfer mechanisms.  They‚Äôre popular because they work for the vast majority as an extortion mechanism.  Their victory was assured the minute the first election was held and the first ballot was cast.  Rugged individualism is an ideal, but has been crushed under the weight of this transfer system.  Of course this all begins to end where we are today, with about 40% of our budget coming from taxes and 60% from new debt issues.  Soon it‚Äôll be 20% to 80%.  Bankruptcy is the universal solution to this great lie.  Our future is one where we‚Äôre so bankrupt as a nation, we can no longer even afford to think about these pie in the sky notions.

            We can (re)build a system that gives cogs a meaningful role.  Existential angst and nihilist lassitude weren‚Äôt  huge issues for our grandfathers and their forefathers.
In a system that afforded working men a measure of security, respect and the prospect of a decent future for their kids Whites did fine.
An honest pro-labor revival is needed as much as political reform. The libertarian/shitlib contempt for the working class has to go and our elites need to fear the rope enough to restore respect for the masses.

Perhaps you believe we need to vote harder to change the issues you identified?I believe that we must start, right now, with focusing on individuals. On OUR People. And begin the work of stripping their mind control and re-establishing long-held understandings about life. Work, family, dignity, honor, sacrifice, God, community.Out of this mental shift we can begin to operate from strong positions to affect change. I don‚Äôt deny that the issues you identified could sink any ‚Äúofficial‚Äù work for Whites, but I‚Äôm convinced the Empire is doomed and will consume itself.Now, a seed, or a remnant, must survive. We can rebuild. We will.

                We are built for work. We must provide the fertile ground for the dignity of work. Skills and labor that is first and foremost accretive to the betterment of the community need to become high status. Status hierarchy must follow this; status accrues to young men who are productive. This must be front and center, transparent, and supported across every aspect of the community. Conversely and just as importantly, financialization, arbitrage, and other games of hucksters and clever sociopaths must be made low status. Men of worth will be attracted to the incentives to achieve status and respect through work. Thats a part of our biology that we must reorient to be congruent with the values we hold.

            The sensible thing any species does is conserve its energy. Laziness is natural and sound in any group of people. Hell Northern Europeans often went long periods doing nothing for good reason.And as for work? Doing what?All those fancy machines take away the need for labor and make much of what remains is either too poorly paid for a dignified family life or too specialized for the 90% of people with an IQ under 120 including Whites BTW.Technophiles and efficiency cuts than whine about welfare having to be paid to the people they laid off. Homie, you don‚Äôt exist in a vacuum and your  kiosk, automation , free trade, Uber or whatever else is someone else‚Äôs living.You want them to have god kids  they will need income, the more urban, the more cost for security and other expenses.And if you think that it isn‚Äôt fragile, hah hah hah no.Good odds that all those cities that have imploded won‚Äôt come back . Its not just Zoom making some office work obsolete but the proliferation  of virtual goods, Amazon and a hundred other things.Without jobs, the only way to get buy is welfare or violence or Communism.And note if our enemies weren‚Äôt so crazy and there wasn‚Äôt an aging hotelier in the way  they‚Äôd be pushing much more of it and in a few years  Comrade Bernie‚Äôs chosen successor  would be running the USSR .It wiuld be Socialism O Muerte  and boxcars all the way down.And you‚Äôd deserve it too.You want a good society, stop freeloading and muzzle not the Ox that treadeth the corn nor repalce him in such a way as none of your tribe may buy food and must resort to begging.

        Diversity, Inclusion, Equity (DIE) has anon been a frontal assault on white civilization. The attack comes in the form of demographics, invasion of intimate social space, and redistributive theft of white wealth. The new ideology must begin with a diametrically opposed stance vis-a-vis DIE. That means racial homogeneity, robust defense of freedom of association, and strong safeguards of public property, although not unbridled capitalism, which destroys tradition and cultural cohesion.

        The solution for us is, and has always been, bottom up organization at the local level‚Äîcommunity.  Because top-down governance has few of the direct human connections in the chain, which align with obligations and responsibilities.  Also, the grifters too easily work their way into the top spots and take everything for themselves, when the matrix of face-to-face obligation and responsibility is absent.Another benefit of bottom-up and local is that there is obviously a culling coming along.  The population, and the composition of the population (givers-takers, smart-dumb, honest-dishonest) is all out of whack and too large to function.  Not everyone will survive, and few will thrive.  Local organization and community maximizes our chances at both.

            really, the answer is quite simple.  eliminate all government work at all levels.  instead of a police force of paid unionists, citizen patrols in each neighborhood; that the neighborhood decides on.  same thing with taxes; everyone is assessed a number of hours to work in the government; including bill gates.  no more public sector unions, no more government pensions, no deep state.

        The idea that ALL men are created ‚Äúequal‚Äù is just an egalitarian fantasy pushed by the  lib left, probably beginning with the snivel rights movement in the bastardized decade of the 60‚Äôs.  The founders certainly didn‚Äôt believe it and I imagine most Whites felt the same up until the crm.  Pretty much anyone now alive has been steeped to one degree or another in that fantasy and it can be a hard one to jettison.  But as this polyglot former nation staggers onward, Whites had better start looking out for numero uno, kith &amp; kin as well as other right thinkers ‚Äì build community as lineman advises ‚Äì  the hour grows ever shorter.

Coupled with a all out war on white society and it‚Äôs values that is still going on to this day.No new system will work unless whites grow a brain, backbone and restore their moral center, Those are the essentials for a stable white society.

                Yes, those traditions, rituals, and fledgling civic bonds borne of necessity and enforced through swift and prudent judgement of the community came from the frontier. Our people many have been bludgeoned apart from that past but the roots remain. The old frontier is gone but ours resides ahead of us. And in that frontier we will do the same. We will cut a life out of the wilderness of post-modernism and decay and grow a verdant life for our posterity because that is what we have always done. Returning to that mindset is a spiritual choice we all must face.

My logic says let the orcs eat each other, implode their cities, ban their politicians and generally reduce their overall numbers without my interference.When the general chaotic velocity falls off, I believe our path to victory will be more clear.In the interim, prepare, strengthen your communal ties, harden yourself mentally, and gather to you as many trustworthy men you can find.

            Attacking ‚ÄúAll men‚Ä¶‚Äù is a non-starter. Bad optics. Tucker uses the formulation ‚ÄúAll men are created equal before God and the law.‚Äù That‚Äôs at least a starting point for a discussion.

        Good essay.  The american empire was built on the ideas of egalitarianism.  I believe a breakup of the empire will be required to have a genuine conservative movement.  If things are going to be fixed we will have to have secession.   It matters little which nationalist is running the the US government.

        In contrast to The American Conservative, Paul Gottfried has been putting out some impressive content since he took over as editor of Chronicles Magazine.  Here is a blog post from yesterday where he blasts the neocons and Conservatism, Inc. yet again.  This deserves wider circulation than it is getting.https://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/blog/conservatives-foolishly-play-the-diversity-game/

            Bannon terrifies the USA police state. While what is alleged can be proven or disproven, when it was alleged is what matters. The point was to keep him as far away as possible from policy. I‚Äôve always doubted the claims he was a leaker and suspect that was orchestrated to oust him due to his nationalist aspirations.

                Bannon is a grifter and fixer who wears the skin of a populist, nationalist race-realist.  Look at his associations and activity both before and particularly since he was in the Trump admin.
He‚Äôs a goyisch Harzony who keeps a display copy of Evola in his bookcase right next to the Torah, Alinsky and Roger Stone‚Äôs biography.

Including the old days, when the rules of acceptable speech and behavior were quite different.  And they still can‚Äôt nail our current President.  Good for him.

Bannon is not popular with Ehud Barak ‚Äì Epstein ‚Äì Lefty Jew Tribe ‚Äì he‚Äôs a Bibi Jignat.By knee-capping Bannon they remove a contentious goy who played the national populist White thing a little too straight for their tastes and they discredit The Wall as a TrumpHitler scam the public has rejected, never to be mentioned again.Jignats will be satisfied with the ‚Äúno Wall‚Äù part and Steve doesn‚Äôt have the Jewce he used to.  They might go light on him but his own faction probably doesn‚Äôt worry about his fate too much.  Plenty more hotter newer shabbos goys to market on the Right.

                            Bannon got the boot by Trump a couple of years ago and no one really cares about him these days or trusts him.It is a symbolic thing though, in New York by the Postal Service on a Trump boat apparently.Its a kind of horse‚Äôs head in the bed deal. Its also a very bad idea as it tells people that this is a gangster state and lacks legitimacy.

        There‚Äôs no ‚Äúsolution‚Äù to the universal and eternal problem of sinful/flawed men. There are only accommodations of varying effectiveness.



This central insight of old timey cravats and pince nez style conservatism is absolutely correct. Conservatism Inc types went off the rails when it abandoned the idea of sin and mulatto cross dresserspaying low capital gains taxbecame their new Eden. Not like those evil dems and their dream of a hellscape with mulatto cross dresserspaying high capital gains tax!

Nationalism is one of the best and most important accommodations, but contra Hollywood ‚Äì it‚Äôs no final solution.

        Side note:  The Southern District of NY goes after Bannon (I‚Äôm not a fan, and he‚Äôs likely guilty) for obviously political reasons.  That district is clearly, at this point, the most weaponized district in the country against anything or anyone right wing.  Notice the circuit in which ALL of these clowns live.  Manhattan, Santa Monica, Palm Beach and DC.   Never never never is it a place where their supporters live.  You don‚Äôt see ‚ÄúSteve Bannon was arrested in his residence in Highland Park, TX.‚Äù  They‚Äôll say oh, oh, THE MEDIA is in those places so it‚Äôs part of my work.  The same media that calls you Hitler and hates your guts?  The same media you proclaim is dead?   Why does Tucker Carlson actually live in DC when he could easily live just across the river?  None of this makes sense when the right wing talking heads and gadflies all seem to live in bluer than blue pockets where these prosecutors are hard wired DNC operatives.  No exposed, famous right winger should live in these places.

        In the 19th century, the frontier exposed the lie of egalitarianism and the inherent conflict between Jefferson‚Äôs vision of a nation of yeoman farmers and merchants and the stirring rhetoric of his 1776 FU to King George.  The urbanization and mass media of the 20th century obliterated the frontier and once again permitted the spread of the poisonous myth of egalitarianism.  The globalization and exaltation of economics in the 21st century has delivered the coup de grace to the rugged individual in favor of collectivism, the failed ‚Äúsolution‚Äù explored by both socialism and fascism.  Most people are incapable of learning the lessons of history.

        Maybe we should start by looking at how our enemies succeed. If we can‚Äôt innovate, we can at least imitate. Then we can move on to getting rigid and unreasonable with our leaders.For example, Latinos provide a concrete model for how to handle community building and biological realism. They‚Äôve ethnically cleansed south central LA with identity and a refusal to get bogged down in ideology.

        I think you are right the America without a frontier doesn‚Äôt make sense.

        Yes. We need that magic 80-85% supermajority to keep the peace and maintain stability. Were culture enough, we could go civnat but culture and ethnicity seem intertwined, few exceptions granted.As far as a definition of conservatism, I think it should be explicitly founded on human nature. Keep what‚Äôs in harmony with it, discard what isn‚Äôt. Humans being social creatures, it isn‚Äôt an endorsement of law of the jungle. Lefty tries to change nature. That‚Äôs the real failure, and it should be hammered incessantly.Equality of nature is a misreading of Jefferson imo. He was clearly talking about equality of natural rights, which is no guarantee of equality of outcome, or even equality under the laws of men. Another point to hammer.

        Z Man said: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs also the fact that the past has been rewritten to support the egalitarianism and universalism of the Left.‚ÄùIt seems that a modified version of european universalism was one of the main sources of bioleninism. I found an essay by a guy named Stefan Jonsson at the new left review that said that the new left began to reject the old white bourgeois¬†eurocentric type of universalism for a global universalism that made room for women, fudge packers and most of all dee colored folk.Unfortunately you have to sign up for an account to read the whole thing. So here‚Äôs a relevant quote.The Ideology of Universalism:‚ÄúUniversalism today is not just an ethical aspiration. Nor is it simply a religious conviction or an epistemological principle; it is, rather, the dominant ideology of our time. It has become an explicit political aim, implemented now by voting booths, now by trading agreements, in international courts of justice or so-called humanitarian interventions, or through the distribution of laptop computers to African schools. Why is this idea now of such paramount importance? Whence the urgency to affirm or deny, to support or question, the existence of universal truths, values or rights? The idea of universalism has become an apparently self-evident signifier, yet, as we shall see, there is another notion of universality that works against this ideology.‚Äù‚ÄúMany thinkers have identified a Eurocentric bias in inherited notions of universality, whether of Christian, humanist or Enlightenment provenance. As a corrective to such limited conceptions, these thinkers often argue for their replacement by a truly planetary one‚ÄîBalibar‚Äôs ‚Äòideal universality‚Äô, or Wallerstein‚Äôs ‚Äòuniversal universalism‚Äô. European thought grounded universality in a specific notion of the human subject. Just as Christianity had regarded worldly activity as secondary and accidental in relation to a heavenly life that was primary and eternal, this subject had the ability to disregard whatever was contingent, local and corporeal. European philosophies of the subject have thus typically disregarded historical, geographical, social and sexual aspects of the human being, while her true essence has been defined as a faculty of reason that makes her autonomous. It was in this capacity, as the foundation of pure and practical reason, that consciousness could develop true knowledge of reality and formulate universal ethical maxims. And it was in this capacity that humans were invested with inalienable rights and freedoms.‚Äù‚ÄúFrom the standpoint of this supra-historical subject, the various cultures and peoples of the world could be interpreted and classified. This subject placed itself in opposition to those who, like Rousseau‚Äôs barbarians, were enclosed within their traditions and unable to liberate themselves from their bodily instincts. Among such unhappy beings were women, labouring classes and non-Europeans. As they gained the ability to speak and produce knowledge on these terms (they had of course always known how to speak and know on their own terms) the prevailing system was challenged. Simone de Beauvoir‚ÄôsThe Second Sex(1949) and Frantz Fanon‚ÄôsBlack Skin, White Masks(1952) are sometimes hailed as symbols of this change. Their lesson was that the transcendental subject never exists in pure form but is always embodied in particular human beings. Universal subjectivity therefore reflects the specific values and interests of those persons through whom it is articulated. With few exceptions, universal subjectivity had been articulated by white men of upper-class background, and the resulting body of thought had been shaped accordingly: a mixture of humanist ideals and patriarchal values, universalism and racism, knowledge and bourgeois ideology.‚Äù

        The quote, I believe, may not be accurate:‚ÄúThen there is that American creed that starts with the assertion that all men are created equal, endowed with inalienable rights. The rejection of universal equality is a rejection of the core component of Americanism.‚ÄùCreated equal is not the same as being equal and universal equality. We know that not all people are equal (i.e., athletic, intellectual and trade talent). I think it was meant to say that no one person was created in such a way as to be above another in our country, unlike a king‚Äôs son compared to a peasant‚Äôs. That‚Äôs why the phrase equal justice under the law is part of our societal ideal too, but as we know not apparently applied equally in today‚Äôs highly charged political environment.

            Maybe that in itself is a lie.  Some men are born to rule, most are born to be ruled.  It‚Äôs as simple as that.  That‚Äôs not to say that the offspring of those men are born to rule (see Prince Charles).   Can it not be said that a personality like Putin was born to rule?  Can it not also be said that the carnival barker Trump, the thin gay man before him, or the imbecile son of another politician before him were all pretenders who couldn‚Äôt lead the country out of a paper bag?

                You‚Äôre confusing the public-presenting actors with the rulers themselves. Politics has become theater.  Ask yourself: No matter who loses any given election, who always wins?   Wall Street/Banksters. The MIC/War crowd. The Cheap Labor/Open Borders crowd. There‚Äôs not a micron‚Äôs difference between either party on any issue that would benefit Americans.

        it‚Äôs simple. conservatism simply needs to conserve two principles:GodThe common good, as best as God-given genes allow, of each of God‚Äôs created nations and their God-given homelands.even pagans and/or socialists not degenerate enough that could be saved yet would agree. though of course I‚Äôd argue Christian conversion of the whole world is still necessary, both for the sake of this world and the next; but not under the guises of ‚ÄúWesternization‚Äù, ‚Äúdemocratization‚Äù, ‚Äúglobalization‚Äù; and definitely not miscegenation nor oneworldism nor individualism nor egalitarianism. missionaries and crusaders, and people who travel abroad really, should be voluntary self-funded exceptions to a mostly based and landed ethnocultural majority in each nation, as opposed to the atheist globalist rootless lifestyle being promoted now.

        It sounds like you are trying to define a word, ‚Äòconservatism‚Äô, which you demonstrate has had a varying definition over some recent decades.  Why go to all this trouble?  What possible benefit would it be?  Are you rather trying to define what some fluctuating group of people write about?  Communism is well-defined, conservatism is not.

        Damn good post.The US does lack a movement or ideology that encourages a new morality in us. If it is even possible, it will have to be a grassroots morality because right now there is just too much noise and bs. We apparently have a new political party who‚Äôs entire platform is ‚Äúthe jews, you guys‚Äù so just wading through the crap will be difficult enough.Perhaps even with its disadvantages, the US population can improve their odds by improving the individual and family morality. I mean, one cant expect a great movement to rise up from people who have a weekly date with their favorite cam girl.Thats a bit hyperbolic, but the point is embracing a ‚Äúnew‚Äù morality on the individual and family level is probably where it is going to have to start since we see where these movements without a moral grounding go: ‚ÄúJoin our movement, whites, we are your only path to status in modern society.‚Äù The National Bioleninism Justice Party for whites, seems a bit silly when you realize any biopower they are appealing to is shrinking by the day. But the worst part is even if it succeeds we are right back at the root of the problem and no closer to a path out.Hm‚Ä¶yeah maybe the US is out of luck for the time being. Realistically, anything which really challenges the current order isnt just going to challenge the character of the US, but even the last 500ish years of ideological development. Thats going to be a lot to chew on.

        ‚ÄúThisonemakes the Straussian argument that conservatism is rooted in natural rights.¬†‚ÄùThe idea of natural rights is the most poisonous idea of the enlightenment. It‚Äôs literally the most progressive idea one can have.‚Äú‚ÄúThe best reason for asserting so bluntly that there are no such rights is indeed of precisely the same type as the best reason which we possess for asserting that there are no witches and the best reason which we possess for asserting that there are no unicorns: every attempt to give good reasons for believing that therearesuch rights has failed. The eighteenth-century philosophical defenders of natural rights sometimes suggest that the assertions which state that men possess them are self-evident truths; but we know that there are no self-evident truths. Twentieth-century moral philosophers have sometimes appealed to their and our intuitions; but one of the things that we ought to have learned form the history of moral philosophy is that the introduction of the word ‚Äòintuition‚Äô by a moral philosopher is always a signal that something has gone badly wrong with an argument.‚Äù‚ÄùMacIntyre

            Be wary of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Nearly all the people who post here are American or European. Virtually none have any experience living in a pre-enlightenment civilization that doesn‚Äôt recognize the existence of unalienable human rights.
It is fine to criticize the progressive paradigm, but don‚Äôt romanticize what life was like before the enlightenment. Almost all of us, statistically, would be on the bottom, and we wouldn‚Äôt much like it.

                                        I look somewhat like Trump. But I used to wear a high-quality kippah when attending Jewish events ‚Äî bar/bat mitzvah, fund raisers, weddings, etc. because a portion of my business depended on dealing with them. The yarmulke still reposes somewhere in the back of my closet but I no longer accept business with them. In any case, it was horrible to listen to their scheming hatred for us goy. Particularly Christians, first and foremost they absolutely _loathe_ devout Christians with intensity of the sun. They have it coming.

                                        I went to a mostly Jewish high school. I had a lot of Jewish friends. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre evil incarnate, but they‚Äôre tribal and they put their tribe‚Äôs interests ahead of gentiles. I can‚Äôt really fault them for that, but I don‚Äôt have to lie down for it. All it would take to displace Jewish power in the US was for White gentile people to realize that they have their own interests and that there is no harm in promoting them.
We had a Christian nation and we deserve to have one again.

Does that mean anything?You can have this talk from different perspectives.From an ideological pov(the most important one actually) is that jewish doctrine exists tojustify slavery&amp; tocommit heinous acts, back in the old days people converted to judaism cause they wanted to sin, christianity did not tolerate such twisted people.From historical pov I know the jewish modus operandi, how they always betray the populations that hosts them.From a racial pov, I know every race needs its space to prosper, otherwise population will be stunted because behaviour changes when rival tribes hunt for the same resources.From a christian point of view, I know the anti christ will be a jewish man because the jews summon him. Basically jews cooperate with demons to get power.The other side has no good arguments other than jewish kids might befriend goyim kids.

                                            Christian Nation? Ugh.Woke is at its core a mutated  Protestant strain and most of the immigration comes not from Jews but Lutherans and Catholics.Unless some kind of muscular Christian strain really takes off, most of what passes for Christian these days is Judeo Christian cuckery and part of the problem.And yes I know this increases the cost of social capital and risks of moral decay. It is what it is.Besides a few centuries most people will be Amish anyway ;

                Before the idea of Universal Human Rights, it was understood that a community gave you a set of rights in return for fulfilling your duties as part of the community.The idea of unalienable human rights disperses with this by giving rights with no responsibilities.I would also add that the idea of human rights has not stopped anyone from putting their boots on the face of their citizens, sometimes while espousing the universality of human rights themselves.

                        The idea always was that you kept your universal rights as long as you did not infringe of the universal rights of others.  Of course, it quickly devolves into an incoherent mess of which ‚Äòuniversal‚Äô rights are more important, especially as the definition broadens to absurdity.That being said, I‚Äôm not thinking we really have a fundamental disagreement.

                    No, they are not inalienable individual rights; they are rights derived from membership and acceptance into the group.  Some groups are more capable, biologically, than others vis a vis delayed gratification, empathy, intelligence and judgment to have certain rights due to their group status; others less so, some not at all.  Having a pulse and human form is not sufficient qualification to possess and use the means of determining questions of life and death.  Jaquarivius needs a gun as much as he needs the right to vote, as he cannot be trusted with either.

                The point is not returning to the pre-Enlightenment. It‚Äôs that no one has ever succeeded in building a non-theological case for the existence of so-called natural rights. That Thomas Jefferson thought otherwise does not change the historical fact.

                        I believe in a theological case for White rights, because we‚Äôre a special case. We‚Äôre the most successful experiment yet, of the many formed by Creation.

Universal human rights, based in mercy? Of course. I could not abide cruelty to animals- because I‚Äôm White.

                        The only theological argument for equalism and its subsidiary universal rights comes from the same side that says ‚Äúthe whole of the law is do as thou wilt.‚Äù  The Lord says ‚ÄúAnd before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd dividethhissheep from the goats.‚Äù  The nations are to be seperated until Judgment.

                        Not really. Most of humanity lives in  or lived in conditions where rights are not a thing and are no more or less sinful than us.This suggests God cares not.Also none of that stuff is Biblical. Its excused Leftism on its face.

                            Not so.  God almighty had rather a lot to say about those who oppress vulnerable classes of people or treat them unjustly.  Reworded and recast this is nothing more or less than establishing the firm principle that people have a RIGHT to flourish and receive justice.Do we need to stipulate that ‚Äúoppress‚Äù does not mean anything like the absurd SJW sense?  Do we need to specify that rights are not ‚Äúguarantees‚Äù in some kind of UN subcommittee sense?Of course rights in the ‚ÄúI have a right to force you to bake me cakes‚Äù or ‚ÄúI have a right to sit next to a white kid in class‚Äù sense don‚Äôt exist.  But it‚Äôs careening wildly in the other direction to say that ALL idea of rights is some kind of current year leftism.For those of us who claim to identify with historical christendom we should avoid the temptation of going full white sharia or dreaming of some asiatic genghis khan empire.Rights, freedom, and yes even universal human dignity ARE important features of our shared culture.  We needn‚Äôt abandon our own heritage because leftists have fagged them up.  A big part of nationalism is keeping out primitives unprepared to participate in our more humane and civilized cultures of rights and reciprocal social obligations.

            Vizzini‚Äôs right that trying to sell 21st century Americans and Europeans on pure anti-Enlightenment philosophy isn‚Äôt going to work.  We will need a couple of generations to start sorting that out.On a long timeline we shouldour focus to protecting the natural rights of families and the needs and interests of the public at large for the future ‚Äì not the individual‚Äôs desires right now.Getting people to accept  bounded individualism is the necessary first step.  Trim the excesses.  It‚Äôs why I‚Äôve always said gays/trannies are the wedge for rolling back Globoshlomo.They‚Äôre the most Other thing out there and reining them in gets people used to applying other limits and disproves the slippery-slope ooga-booga gaslighting about ovens and cattle-cars.

        Hey I‚Äôm a young guy here but a fan so heres my 2 cents for what it‚Äôs worth. More people in my life have been talking about civil war and break up of states more than ever. It‚Äôs odd to see since I‚Äôve been a caricature of the libertarian conspiracy prepper since 2012. (I‚Äôm 27 now, and have moved more right since) it‚Äôs very white pilling to see many of us young guys getting into building community, firearms, and even building small business. Most the the gen z guys just dont care for anything public related when it comes to government and politics, but when they do they‚Äôre great allies. We already are forming our own groups in response to the faux crises and alot of skills have been learned since the pandemic. (All the canning jars are sold out) anyways its thanks to you Zman that we are starting to build groups to weather the storms.

        The problem with the new Right, DR or whatever you call it is this, the biggest group of America-haters are White Americans, lots and in fact most of the BLM Aunteefah crowd are young moronial Whites. Your ethno-nationalism, soft or hard will be a colossal failure with this group. Although Trump policies benefit White Americans the most, he has the lowest White approval and the biggest non-White approval amongst all Republican Presidents,Unfortunately, Whites ‚Äúmen‚Äù of the moronial generation have become bitter, brainwashed soy-cucks and nothing seems to shake up their beta male cuck ways. Maybe the changing racial composition of the US is not such a bad thing.

        Most of the commenters sound like kids writing their Christmas wish list. Alas, there is no Santa.An explicit  white state won‚Äôt happen unless it serves the tribe‚Äôs needs. That would probably require the Browntopia turning on them in a big way.That may happen but it will make the Whitetopia short lived because the tribe will continue to control the media, finance and entertainment. By the next generation at the latest they will begin to start the multicultural propaganda all over again (if they even stop it in the first place). You are fooling yourself if you think that whites in mass will suddenly become anti Semitic. They worship the tribe in spite of how openly hateful they are to whites.The chamber of commerce is still going to want imported cheap labor and young whites are largely woke especially the women.
