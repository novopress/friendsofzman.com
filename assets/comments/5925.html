        I’m betting that “educational attainment” correlates pretty strongly with a woman’s understanding of gender roles — specifically, whether or not she expects to find a man to marry who will be the family’s primary breadwinner.One could argue that women are more likely to pursue educational credentials when they are less likely to believe traditional gender roles are the operative norm for society (this is different from whether or not women would *prefer* such gender roles; I’ve met many women who’ve said they dream of a 1950s-style housewife lifestyle, but have lost faith that such a thing is still possible — at least for women outside the top 2 percent in terms of attractiveness). Women focus on education because they believe pretty strongly that they’re gonna have to fend for themselves. Devoting greater resources to education then leads to lower fertility.Girls raised with a much stronger expectation of traditional gender roles will be more likely to invest their resources in family than in education, regardless of their IQs.The message Western women might be sending us is that they don’t expect Western men to be of much use in the future.

            No, the message Western women are signaling is they want the sexual freedom to ride the c*ck carousel until they hit the wall of declining  beauty and attractiveness, that was formerly used to attract a strong, supportive, resource-sharing mate!They are now taught by feminists to believe they “can have it all”: mucho sex with the hot alpha bad-boys/rock drummers, an education, a fulfilling career, followed by two children with a solid beta-boy worshiper-provider (actual parenthood of the children undecided/unknown).Its simply open, unmitigated hypergamy they want, with no constraints on the number of parties and orgasms, until THEY decide that beta-boy marriage looks good, because they can no longer ensnare the desired alphas with their declining looks and sagging bodies.

        Success has been redefined. The Leave it to Beaver/Ozzie and Harriet middle class achievement of comfort, family, house in the burbs and a satisfying partnership is no longer. Kids today are eating their own seed corn of the future. Living like grasshoppers. Not money, time. I predict a lot of single unhappy 45 year olds is the future.

        Briefly, since I am trying to clear up some of the backlog of post surgery chores today:1.  Iran has perhaps the highest female tertiary education level (currently making up 60% of the university population) in Dar al Islam with universities resorting to quotas (feminists of course labelling that as “banning women”) to try and restore some balance:http://tinyurl.com/z9xmtg72.  There is a high correlation between penetration of broadcast TV and low TFR as well.  No time to find a primary source, but this pop science article is a starting point:http://tinyurl.com/jctpldeThis article is about India, but research has also been done on rural Brazil.3.  As always, Anthony Burgess was very prescient about these things.  In the 60s, he wrote a novel where TV would be used to indoctrinate the masses to embrace lower fertility.  And I cannot find it on line!  To paraphrase the money quote the themes were that big families were bad and small families good and that gay love was better than straight love.

            The Iranian numbers are an interesting topic. On the one hand, the Persians have always had a more liberal approach to female education. On the other hand, the prospects for educated women are minimal, thus making “university” a pointless exercise. David Goldman has written about this quite a bit.
Even so, my inclination is to see some undisclosed causes behind the desire of women to get credentials and avoid having children. If we saw this same phenomenon in the animal kingdom, the species would be on a watch list.
