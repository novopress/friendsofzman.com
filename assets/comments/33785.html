        I can’t say this often enough and loudly enough:
FVCK ISRAEL!
I’m sick and tired of having that country in my face each and every day of my life. I can’t turn on the news without hearing about fvcking Israel! EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. OF. MY. LIFE.
It’s just like how gay propaganda has to be in our face all the time.
STOP!

                            This afternoon, somebody poasted the following numbers at /pol/.
If the numbers are real, then they’re rather terrifying:

                Gore Vidal began a famous essay in The Nation by quoting George Orwell, who in one of his letters noted that it was not possible to say anything about Jews , positive or negative, without getting into trouble.  Vidal proceeded to say things about Jews, and got into trouble.  Buckley, on the other hand, was always very careful never to get into trouble.

            Yes. It’s annoying that the Zionist-controlled government and the Zionist-controlled media treat Israel as if it were the 51st state. Better than that, actually — they pay far more attention to Israel than they do to West Virginia or Kansas.That being said I do not hate Israel per se so much as I hate the incessant pro-Israeli propaganda and the Israeli ownership of Congress. In true Monroe Doctrine fashion, I don’t think is is any of our business to care about Israel one way or the other, nor for that matter to care about the Palestinians or the Syrians or the Lebanese. If the Jews in Israel want to think they are God’s Chosen People in the Land of Milk and Honey and want to slay Amalek, whatever. If the Muslims conquer it, I couldn’t care less. It’s a shitty little scrap of foreign desert.Not my monkeys, not my circus.This U.S. existed from 1781 until 1948 with Judea under Ottoman control we did just fine. Israel isn’t the fucking end-all-and be-all of the universe.If the entire Levant, both Jewish and Muslim, were to get wiped off the map tomorrow it wouldn’t affect my life in the Rust Belt one iota.

                I feel the same way.  I have no particular animosity towards it, I’m just sick of hearing about it and how their problems become our problems.  The whole islamic world hates us because of the toxic relationship we have with them.

                I’ve always said that it was only natural for Jews to lobby for things in their own interest and that it doesn’t bother me. What always rubbed me the wrong way was the Republicans in Congress, like those waving Israel flags and not even being Jews, who rub me the wrong way. They act like Uncle Toms and now I understand why blacks truly used to hate their own house knee grows.

                    -“I’ve always said that it was only natural for Jews to lobby for things in their own interest and that it doesn’t bother me.”Superficially I would agree with that, but Zionism is a different matter altogether because Zionism is the fulfillment of the Jewish religion and the Mosaic covenant.As such I think that official U.S. support of Zionism and the State of Israel violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. It’s the equivalent of giving $4 billion a year in taxpayer money to Saudi Arabia to maintain Mecca as the holy city and to keep the dhimmi out of the Grand Mosque, or giving $4 billion to the Vatican to maintain St. Peter’s as the seat of Catholicism.From a First Amendment perspective (and from a Madisonian/Washingtonian perspective) the financial support and political fealty we pay Israel is profoundly un-American.

They would consider the aid we give anyone profoundly un-American. Kind of like someone (@3g4me?) cited about Crockett a few days back.

                        Zionism is not the fulfillment of the Jewish religion or the Mosaic Covenant. It is a con job that is not even 200 years old.Orthodox Jews use to believe that only the Messiah would bring them back to the promised land. Zionism establishing Israel means that they, collectively, are claiming to be the Messiah according to what the Jewish religion use to be.The Mosaic Covenant was broken in the days of the Torah. The destruction of the first temple signified that fact and was confirmed by Jeremiah who also said the first covenant would be replaced with a second. The Mosaic Covenant is null and void.Zionism is one of those nutty religious ideas no serious person should believe.Furthermore, that nutty religious idea is what is forcing America to be a belligerent global empire no matter what. We cannot honestly talk about politics because of it. Our best sons need to go overseas to get mangled and die pointlessly because of it. The MIC is untouchable because of it. Our total political corruption and endless foreign meddling e.g. USAID is required by it.You might realize that Zionism has been worse for Americans than the Woke mind virus if someone were able to lay it out plainly. Any reform away from empire – in politics, military, foreign policy, economics, or propaganda – cannot succeed while Zionism controls the American ruling class.

                            I think a lot of Orthodox Jews still believe this, even the ones in Israel – it’s part of the deal that was originally forged, they’ll sit back and let the state happen, basically, but they’re not going to take part in it. Of course the government broke that deal and are not drafting them to fight in the military. Glenn Greenwald once had an Orthodox Jew who discussed this topic, I think he is in New York. He was quite adamant in his belief that Israel as it is currently constituted is an illegitimate and anti-Jewish state.

                    There’s a December 2024articleover at Tablet Mag which starts out looking like a kind of Limited Hangout on how the elite manufacture of consent works. Limited because the author wants to dump on ‘Obama’ as the designated scapegoat. Still it’s a good, if long read which spells out how radical new ideologies become ‘established givens’. Much good stuff on the career of one David Axelrod appears here.The author gives a very detailed explanation for Musk’s motivations in buying Twitter and for why the powers that be made the mistake of letting him get away with it.All very well and by this point the reader is beginning to nod in sympathy and mayhap a little sleepily… Of course anyone from our side of the river knows that somewhere behind this Obammy-bashing is dislike of him for having done deals with Iran and the more recent October 7 unpleasantness which forced certain (ahem) Recalibrations. But will this remain discreetly veiled or will it all come out?And then towards the end… kaboom! Massive id dump / pus eruption from Author Samuelson and suddenly we’re talking more Fangs Out than Hang Out.Really worth a read.

                The only states that the conservative media likes and pays attention to are New York and Florida, which just happen to be two states with significant Jewish populations.I’m just tired of it. You read the New York Post and it’s obvious that Americans are 2nd priority for them. And the thing that is most frustrating is that this is all that we had, for a long time. The option was either be a shitlib or a Zionist. Indeed, a lot of people will stil say that Zionism is a pre-condition to joining their stupid little club. And what did regular Americans get in exchange for this support? Nothing. Nothing at all. Total disenfranchisement and to be treated like a 2nd class citizen (as opposed to a 3rd class citizen with the Dems). I know he is not the brightest star around here, understandably, but Nick Fuentes has talked about this a lot, and how the deal is totally one sided. The Zionists will never, ever, EVER do a trade, you support my thing and I support your thing. It’s, you support my thing or I call you an antisemite and you are cast into the wilderness.

                Agreed. Make the announcement that any government official, elected or not, who spends or appropriates a single dollar of taxpayer money to some foreign entity is presumed guilty of selling out America. He has one, non-appealable opportunity to prove to a jury of net taxpayers that what he did was both Constitutional and in the interests of Americans, as opposed to American interests.
Unless acquitted, he and his family are asset stripped to the skivvies and he gets the Count Vlad treatment on the National Mall. MIGA! Make Impalement Great Again.

            We’re all tired of MIGA. Besides being incredibly annoying and degrading, the whole Israel, Israel, Israel schtick feels retrograde. It’s another example of a 20th century phenomenon that just won’t die.You can feel the world moving on. Israel is the Zelensky of countries. This little piece of shi$ who won’t shut up, has never-ending demands and causes the world endless – and needless – trouble. Just as the US and Russia are pushing Zelensky aside, I’d suspect that the world will slowly push Israel aside.Sure, they’ll continue to control our Congress. We seem incapable of slapping them down. But the US is a receding power. Technology is making war too difficult, so Iran is fine. China just wants to do business and won’t listen to Jewish psychobabble. Indians are the same scheming conmen as Jews so no luck there. Russia knows how to deal with them.As much as I’m sick of Israel, I do believe that they are fading annoyance, which is a small victory.

                Iran will never be fine until they test a nuke.  While nobody sane wants to see more nuclear states, what other choice do they have?  A major war in Iran would have major world effects.  The price of oil would likely double.

                    You’d think that the oil issue would be enough to keep the Israeli – and the American – lunatics at bay. If oil hits $120 or higher due to a war, the whole global system shuts down.
It’s this kind of madness that makes me think that the Chinese and other emerging powers are going to feel the need to take the keys away from Israel and its American golem.

                        Unfortunately, the elite learned all the wrong lessons from Covid. It used to be that there were some checks on ideology because the elite knew that if the party they backed wrecked the economy in the name of some grandiose cause, they would get voted out and then those icky dirt people would get some of what they wanted.Covid taught them that you can do whatever you like and just plaster over the economic effects with billions in money conjured out of nowhere. There’s also the consolidation of the two big parties into the Uniparty that allows the elite not to care about “their” party getting voted out because they own both parties. This is part of the reason they hate Trump so much since he represented a movement within the GOP to restore the party to genuine popular control.The Ukraine war also revealed that American neocons are not even very concerned at the prospect of a nuclear war. Trump needs to purgeallthe fanatics, whether MIGA types, Covid kooks, or Russophobes.

                            Good point.  It’s the 5 year anniversary of the Covid madness and still, to this day not one of these freaks have so much as lost their jobs, let alone prison or worse.During the madness I just said we need to write down their crimes and their names and that one day the madness would pass and their day would come.  Sadly, everyone just decided at the end of 22 that Covid was over and we could all just pretend none of it ever happened.  Nobody lost their jobs for refusing the vax.  There were no vaccine passports. No footprints on the floor in the supermarket.  No beatings and arrests for not wearing a mask. And much, much more.  Poof!  Gone like the wind.

Hahaha. Sure, if “popular control” means tech billionaires like Musk and Thiel, the Jewish financier class, and pajeet strivers like Ramaswamy. Trump just represents a different faction of the elite.

The infinite Pajeet H1B thing still makes me mad for self interested reasons. I think Trump is trying to play a bunch of different factions right now and he doesn’t always choose right.

Based on his recent statements and actions he’s looking awfully compromised.
Tariffs and DOGE are just cute words to hide the real plan, which is indefinite austerity for the plebes.
They know that, “austerity,” is a four-letter word to 99% of Americans.

                        120 Dollars a barrel is probably the best case scenario, simply priced for some risk.  If Iran actually started sinking tankers, the sky is the limit.  I think something like 40% of all oil passes through the Straits of Hormuz.  Sky high prices could be a luxury under those conditions.

                            It’s “only” about 20% now that passes through Hormuz. Less all the time, by design (more pipelines). Just in terms of physical supply, not taking price into consideration, East Asia would be hit the hardest by a closure of Hormuz. IOW, Hormuz will be closed over China’s dead body. Because a dead body is what they’ll be without oil coming through that strait. Pricewise I couldn’t really guess what the impact would be. But AINO physical supply would not be threatened. Almost entirely from Canada, Mexico, and domestic.

                                Most of our domestic oil supply is shipped out of the US because we don’t have the refining capacity for the oil we produce.
While it is certainly complicated somewhat, there is no reason oil bound for the US today has to be bound for the US tomorrow.  We don’t need a big shortage to wreak havoc on the system.  There was a hurricane or something that hit Louisiana and there were long gas lines along the Southern East Coast.  IIRC, Atlanta was hit especially hard.

            My senator Rick Scott was doing some video in his office that was unrelated to Israel, yet there was a giant Israel flag on the wall behind him. I understand that Florida has lots of Jews and if you get donor bux from them, you’re going to support their causes. But those giant and conspicuous flags? It’s so transparent, and tiresome. It’s to the point that I if a (((donor))) offered sexual services to his wife or daughter Rick’s first thought probably is, will this get me in trouble if I say no?

            The Israel First agenda has gone into overdrive with Trump 2.0. The courts stop anything related to America First but never touch Israel First. The height of absurdity and submission was Kennedy labeling Anti Semitism as a health crisis.
There is a positive side to this though. The Israel First agenda combined with daily scenes of Jews killing children is making people notice who previously have not allowed themselves to notice.
It has become a good way to detect people with courage versus grifters.

            There is no upside to even mildly criticizing openly stated projects like “Greater Israel” from “America’s Greatest Ally”..but there are huge potential downsides.
On the longer timeline, I take some solace from the fact that there is a cyclical nature of the chosen living the high life and curb stomping their neighbors for 100 years…then get another 1000 years in the wilderness.  Rise, repeat.

        I always post this Sobran classic when the non-Whites are whining about us on Twitter:“Western man towers over the rest of the world in ways so large as to be almost inexpressible. It’s Western exploration, science, and conquest that have revealed the world to itself. Other races feel like subjects of Western power long after colonialism, imperialism, and slavery have disappeared. The charge of racism puzzles whites who feel not hostility, but only baffled good will, because they don’t grasp what it really means: humiliation. The white man presents an image of superiority even when he isn’t conscious of it. And, superiority excites envy. Destroying white civilization is the inmost desire of the league of designated victims we call minorities.”

        This may be hearsay, but I’ve read that Buckley didn’t have nearly as much money as he appeared to have, and thatNational Reviewalways operated at a loss and was kept afloat by wealthy benefactors. Buckley’s defenestration of the paleocons like Sobran and his denunciation of Buchanan may well tip us off to (((who))) those benefactors were.It’s also interesting that when the Catholic Buckley retired, he handed the reins of NR off to the (ahem) “non-Catholic” Jonah Goldberg.And finally Buckley was a CIA man, and we know that the Deep State manipulated the media for many years.Add it all up and it appears that Buckley was probably ZOG-controlled opposition.

            NR never made money in the conventional sense. This is true, but it made Buckley rich and famous, so he could cover the losses. NR provided a platform  for his career as a speaker, writer and television act. He commanded enormous speaking fees at his peak. He was not tech billionaire rich, for sure, but he was wealthy. He could also tap into old school, old money networks for support. The Olin Foundation underwrote his television ventures.
Buckley handed the reigns to Rich Lowry, not Jonah Goldberg.

            I have a friend who accuses everyone she doesn’t like of being an “agent”. And I’ve always been suspicious of this charge because people are not psychologically stable enough to just lie their whole lives. I’m not criticizing you I’m just wondering, how does being a cia man work?is there a phone call that was made? Weekly check ins? How do they coordinate messaging? How does the cia know Buckley isn’t going to have one to many g n ts and blab about it?theres a hundred more of these types of questions which is why I’ve always hesitated to accuse people of holding “receipts”.

                It’s a great question, and I can’t say for sure, but journalists get information from government “sources” and those sources may be deliberately planting and/or withholding information. Probably not giving direct orders though.
Operation Mockingbird was widely believed to be a real thing, and we know that the FBI was censoring social media content on Facebook and Twitter during the Biden administration. So I don’t think it’s pure tinfoil-hat stuff to presume that the press isn’t as free as we are led to believe.

                The CIA is full of professional liars. To take a famous and obvious case, we know that there are 51 intel spooks who have no compunction about very publicly lying to achieve some political goal. Even after being found out, they remain proud of what they did. Extrapolate from there. How many “journalists” are cut from that same cloth? How many senators? How many other times have they done this without anybody knowing any better? How far does this extend to the “rank and file”? To the average voter? I betcha no fewer than 2/3 of Harris voters would approve of 2020 being stolen if they were shown it was incontravertibly true. “It wasn’t stolen but it was a good thing if it was!” You never heard them complaining about those “dirty 51” did you? Messaging doesn’t have to be coordinated (other than by the msm). Everybody knows the message. Everybody knows what team they are on.

                It would work the way any other form of corruption works. Play ball with us – and there’s lots of room in the Swamp to hide your payoffs and assets if ya know the right people. The friendly cop on the corner is owned by us – and we’ll make sure he doesn’t bother ya. No need to be covert about most of it. Everyone has friends who in turn have friends of friends. It’s a small club, and if you’re in it, everyone knows who and where you are and what you’re doing. Play ball and maybe a hot stock trading tip falls in your lap. The good ol’ standard media grift machine will do everything for you that it does for all the other carpet baggers. Supposedly intelligence agencies are different organizations from organized criminals but their methods are largely same. Perhaps the only difference is that one is sanctioned by the gubbimint and the other is not.

                It’s like the “Epstein client list.” We know exactly who’s on it but we demanditanyway, on official ruling class stationery. In the meantime (forever), everyone on it can go about his business, in no danger of encountering any people’s justice.Agents give themselves away all the time,accidentally or hubristically,and nobody really cares or does anything about it.They know this. There are guys in our thing we absolutely know are feds, characters of whom there isno other explanation. And we do nothing about it, while they go on—ever more smugly.As I’m sure I’ve said too many times, the regime is just people who know each other and hate you.

                I don’t think it takes nearly as much work as you think it does. You will frequently see “journalists” today say that none of their bosses ever told them what to say or write. And, yopu know what, I believe them. The “journalists” know where their bread is buttered and know what to say. They get access to sources that feed this info to them when needed and they get lots of praise and high salaries for doing so. So, it all works out. This dynamic goes on for so long enough, and Buckley can have any drinks and blab whatever he wants, the person he is saying it too knows how the game is played too and was hired for it.

                I thought we got over the “conspiracies cant happen because people cant keep secrets” thing.  Remember corona virus?  The uh… manhattan project?  Buulding 7?
Lots of people can keep lots of secrets when the incentives are lined up enough and the disincentive is your car suddenly accelerates and crashes bursting into flames for no reason and it turns out you burned to death inside it and there is helicopter video of you looking just fine but hysterically trying to escape from a body bag being rapidly wheeled into a truck.

                When Lord Randolph Churchill died, he owed the Rothschilds 70,000 pounds, which would be $50 million today..That was forgiven with the apparent agreement of Winston to play ball for the jews…In the 1930s, the profligate Churchill would have lost his estate, but a South African billionaire bailed him out…Winston was owned…Similarly, Buckley was controlled opposition…also vulnerable because he was a closet gay…

        Thanks for a fantastic show, Z. It really was about envy. Sobran and Sam Francis were both brilliant writers who were banished because of envy.
Sobran’s New York Times headline “New York Destroyed by Earthquake; Women and Minorities Hit Hardest” is one of his best.

        The Sobran affair was important, but it was far from the first example of what was later called Cancel Culture! M. E. Bradford suffered a similar fate during the Reagan admin. And in “academia,” conservative/right-wing candidates for positions were being weeded out for consideration by the 80’s, and very probably earlier, just for their views. By the time Sobran lost his NR position, Political Correctness was already rampant. I was there.

                Yes, that’s how I observed it happening. By the 70’s, lots of radical leftists were getting entrenched in colleges and universities, and able to do lots of damage.There were already many liberal faculty before that, but they tended to be more sympathetic to free speech than the later ones. I suspect that the turning point was in the 60’s when weak college administrators started letting the radicals have their way. Allan Bloom and others wrote about this. And as you said, the rot spread from colleges to all other institutions.The seeds of PC were planted earlier. Frankfurt School people such as Adorno were already pushing The Authoritarian Personality by 1950. Marcuse put out his stuff later on, which became popular in certain circles. But it wasn’t just (((usual suspects))). Kinsey’s first book on human sexuality which did so much damage was in 1948, and it became dogma, even though it was proven to be fraudulent. John Dewey was another bad influence. And following him, there were the college “education” departments, which had such a terrible impact, promoting a lot of nonsense and activism.

                    All true.  And all examples of how/why nothing can be ‘reformed’ or fixed with tinkering at the edges.  Sure, get rid of the Dept. of Education.  But the teachers’ certification programs and unions, the textbook publishers, and the people who start their political careers via the school board remain untouched and massive.  The whole concept of universal and compulsive state-directed responsibility for children is as ‘left’ as it gets – and almost all good ‘murkins blithely entrust their 1.2 children to the borg.

            Although not the first, the most truly epic example of cancel culture was of course Alexander Solzhenitsyn.  I was there in the late 60’s and early 70’s when he was like a god to the founding fathers of neoconservatism.  And to be fair many other anticommunists as well.   Lionized throughout the West.  And then there was the Nobel Prize.His fall began soon after his expulsion when he refused to embrace our decadent culture and instead retreated to isolation in Vermont.  Then when things settled down after the fall of the USSR he returned to Russia.  It turned out that although he hated communism he loved Russia.  That was unacceptable to his most fervent original supporters here.Then he wrote That Book and it was all over for him here.  He died covered with honors in Putin’s Russia, but here has been Hurled Into The Void (™z).

        For the last 25 years of his life, Buckley didn’t even care about politics. It was all about fame.  Joe Sobran was a solid guy who wrote the forward for one of Bob Whitaker’s books.   In the long run, Sobran, Francis and Whitaker will have great influence over this century. Buckley will have none.

        Tucker Carlson interviewed Rick Sanchez a few days ago. Both have been fired and hurled into the void by the same places.  Comparing notes, they both agreed that they generally had journalistic freedom – as long as they never crossed the neo-cons.
They went right to the edge of noticing the real reason they couldn’t criticize our war machine – but wouldn’t say it.  Could almost see the root cause hanging in the air around them in that interview.

                Not giving tuck quite enough credit there.  Did you see the show he did with martyr made?  He gave a hearing (and a fair amount of open approval) to questioning several of the primary myths of the 20th century.  Our greatest allies threw a bit of a fit but they were smart enough not to bring the full streisand effect in on WW2I think tucker gets it and is leading his audience RIGHT to the edge of what they allow.  But for anyone who follows him that far it’s very easy to see what lies right beyond that and a lot of people in his audience do.Even so nobody with a platform as big as his is willing to say the things he does.  Rogan isnt even in the same universe

        I’m looking forward to listening to this – but I listened to your last show with Paul Ramsey and the comments about the space program’s stagnation got me thinking about how it lines up with the stagnation of our industries and our culture as well. The space program was such a jolt of energy and innovation to our society and you can draw a straight line from it to the computing revolution and everything that came from it. But the space program became nonfunctional and a DEI boondoggle, our bureaucracies became totally soy and feminized, and now our culture and technology is the same way. It all feels tied together, one followed the other. We replaced this incredible space program with critical race theory and it destroyed the vitality of our society.

            The heroic era of the space program was, to Kennedy’s great disgust, disproportionately the work of midwesterners—and Germans who looked like midwesterners.
Those people aren’t allowed to do things anymore, not prominent things where they can clearly be seen failing to “look like America.”
Our decline isn’t entirely reducible to that, but it almost is.

A lot of this has to do with technological stagnation and the competency crisis.
To move forward, we would need a technological singularity like cheap, compact fusion reactors, easily manufactured room temperature superconductors, or sentient AI devoted to helping, not exterminating, mankind.

        “Even today, public officials feel they must publicly swear loyalty to Israel for fear of being cancelled.”My guess is that it’s more blackmail than any sort of organic cancellation. Besides the Epstein’s goy children rape ring taking place on an island filled with hidden cameras, a majority of VPN companies are owned by Israelis with ties to Israeli intelligence, as are many internet relay, TCP/IP, etc companies – and, I just read, the Carbyne 911 emergency response system that snarfs up GPS data, live video feeds, and audio from callers’ smartphones. It seems that spying for political blackmail may be Israel’s biggest industry.Just as astrophysicists can intuit invisible black holes from how other visible objects behave, it seems obvious that from the public behavior of say Lindsey Graham and John Roberts that it is likely that they are being blackmailed. I imagine many if not most powerful American and European leaders are.

        I was a deep libertarian in those days, and while I thought the Paleocons made some good points, I also thought they were hopelessly out of touch with the evolving culture. That much was true, but I didn’t realize then that culture (and the genetics associated with it) was the true battlefield, not the material economy. I also believed that Israel and its diaspora were on our side, or could be won over to it. Such is the folly of youth.However, what happened to Sobran, Sam Francis, and even Pat Buchanan was an eye opener, and helped me start to realize that something was rotten in Denmark.

        In trying to explain the treacherous behavior of people like Buckley who are so willing to betray their own flesh and blood, I can only surmise that this is what happens when a culture is transformed from one based on honor (pre-WWII) to one based on mercantilism (post-WWII).  Naturally, he calculates that it would benefit him more to show fealty to his new masters, who can only thrive when every man sees himself an individual and is always for sale.

Can’t agree enough.  The faith that ties together the Puritans, the Judeos, and the wicked is the Church of Mammon.
It crosses all boundaries, whether nation or race, and doesn’t have a Heaven, only an Eden returned.  That is, all earthbound, no above.

        The second modern dollar coin (after the Susan B. Anthony debacle) had James Madison on the face.  It was gold in color so that it was less easy to confuse with a quarter than the Susan B.  Too bad it never caught on.  Here in Europe the smallest bill is a five euro note.Insofar as Israel is concerned, it seems to me that the time has come and gone for there to be a Jewish state in the Levant.  But for US support, Israel would have gone the way of the Crusader Kingdoms, and, as other commentators have noted, the US is a receding power, Israel’s fate is likely to be that of the Crusader Kingdoms.  I doubt that even its nuclear weapons can save it.

            The problem with a dollar coin is it has little added utility beyond four quarters, which are easy to carry and a one dollar bill.  They should mint a $2.50 coin.  It would be similar to the German 5 mark piece, which was a very handy coin to carry back in the day before the Euro.
I will leave it for others to figure who should be on the coin.  FWIW, I think the Sacajawea dollar coin is quite possibly the most beautiful coin ever minted.  Don’t get me started on the current visual state of U.S. coinage. [It stinks].

        It is a good reminder that you can think well of someone in the whole, even though they have done you wrong, in your view, over a particular issue. Even the best men have terrible flaws.this is very well said and it’s heartening to know this about sobran. There’s a temptation to write people off and throw them out if their flaws do damage. Perhaps there is some distance that needs to be kept but to not forgive not speak to the person or hold a grudge for decades which can happen shows a lack of charity and indicates a small soul. im really talking to myself really.  People have real flaws, it’s an eternal lit of man on this side of eternityits what is really meant  by turning the other cheek and forgiving 777 times or whatever.it doesn’t mean being a doormat like the pagans on the right consistently accuse Christians of.

        The problem with the Holocaust is America and Britain had absolutely nothing to do with it and spent enormous blood and treasure fighting the people doing it.  Yet, for some ungodly reason, every friggin city in the US has a Holocaust museum and cries of “Never Again” against all White people!!!  The Russians also spent enormous blood and treasure fighting the NAZIs and they hate the Russians more than ever.This is the problem with minorities (foreigners) living in your midst.  They endlessly agitate for what they care about.  I couldn’t care less about the holocaust.  I take great offense to the holocaust museum in my city.  It sickens me that they force our children to attend their museum of lies.David Cole, a Jewish Holocaust “skeptic” (I don’t think he is a skeptic anymore) proved films the holocaust museum were forcing kids to watch as real historical footage is literally a B-movie made after the war., Not a single Nazi in it. He found the source complete with credits. He has a bunch of other examples of BS fakery in these museums all over America.  Like everything else in America, it’s just a big grift.

        The canceling of Sobran and Buchanan was the beginning of my exit from conservatism. I had been a faithful reader of NR and Human Events and a supporter of the standard GOP platform. When the “conservatives” turned on Sobran and Buchanan, I was amazed that these two stalwarts had become pariahs because they were insufficiently devoted to Israel. I was well aware of the Jewish taste for Communism/Socialism and their control of the Democratic Party but I was not aware of their massive influence on the GOP and  conservatism. You don’t have to do much digging to find the Jewish roots of so many of our disasters: the Middle East wars, the free trade policy that has eviscerated our productive economy, the deluge of legal and illegal immigrants, the pollution of our culture with abortion,  pornography, and transgenderism. Once you see it, you can’t unsee it. It will be the undoing of Trump if he allows MIGA to trump MAGA and gets us in a war with Iran.

But the black, the super fat girl, the Latinx’s and the little boy in his beanie cap are all there front and center.
They hate us. They all hate us.

                It might also be all they can “bus in” from the nearest DC public school district.  Just because the districts and surrounds have rich White families doesn’t mean those families use the public school system.  When Trump signed the EO on title nine excluding physical males in women’s sports, the Oval Office was a much more normal scene.

                But ‘hate’ has been anathematized by every public and private group in society.  Even Christians are taught it’s badthink to ‘hate’ evil.  Everything is feminized ‘luv.’  You are right – they hate and envy us and want to eliminate us.  But 95% of Whites seem incapable of recognizing and accepting that fact.

That’s just an excuse to not make any effort to grok who they are. It’s like you quoted in your earlier reply,“…let’s call it cooperation, our cooperation with Israel. That is fundamental to who we are.”They are telling you who they are. Why not take them at their word?

        I also remember reading National Review in High School. Your description of Buckley’s writing is spot on. It became too much of a chore for me to read most of his stuff back then. As time went on I slogged through it on the occasion of a NR purchase while traveling. How interesting it is to look back at these times when Sobran, Buchanan and a lot of these guys were doing their best work. Easy to see now. Not so easy when living through it. The dissident realist in me looked to these guys for a proper perspective. I’m not sure anything coming out of NR helped me as much as they did.From a North American White Anglo Saxon Protestant’s perspective we are not the same we are not equal they are not like us. Other than tea and sympathy what allegiance do we owe Israel or any of the other countries? None! Relegating the Federal Government to enumerated powers only combined with an avoidance of foreign entanglements will get us to a good starting point for reform. Like that will happen ever or anytime soon. Buckley’s shenanigans reminds me of Paul Ryan’s declaration of “this is not who we are” diatribe. Cancelling the voices of guys like Sobran are a poor substitute for identity creation. Pussies do that shit. Get out of NATO. Focus on North America.

        ‘It is a good reminder that you can think well of someone in the whole, even though they have done you wrong, in your view, over a particular issue’
Good counsel.
‘Even the best men have terrible flaws’
They do.  There are no exceptions.  It’s tough to be a saint on a cursed planet.  The evil’s already there, waiting for ya.
The idea is to take from the ‘best of men’ what they have to offer, and to recognize and celebrate their contributions.  But don’t confuse them with God.

I hope some realize the Holocaust story is meant to replace the Crucifixion.
As Rabbi himself says, the Mosiach is the nation, its corpus the body of its people.(Thus, Covenant prophecy has been fulfilled, the Anti-Christ manifested- that is, arrived- in 1948.  The Mosiach, remember, IS God.)

        Describing the jihad against wrong thinkers as domestic terrorism is a accurate assessment.
Ron Unz has written about earlier columnists who were canceled for angering the tribe. There was one, whose name escapes me, who was the top columnist in the country before WW2. He started questioning the official narrative off WW2. Oy vey. He was canceled and memory holed.
I had never even heard of him before Unz wrote about his situation.
Does anyone know his name?

                My favorite anecdote from the era is from legendary commie Dalton Trumbo, author ofJohnny Got His Gun, the most famous American antiwar novel of the time. In the ’40s his book was out of print, at his own insistence—for the war effort! When worried “mothers” (he singled “mothers” out when he talked about this) would write to him wondering if they might buy a copy, hoping to give it to their sons to dissuade them from enlisting, he’d forward their letters to the FBI, and request that they be put on a list of nazi subversives. Which they probably were.America has always been insane.

                    The crazy American faction gained the upper hand after Appomattox and there was no turning back, if that ever were possible, from the madness at that point. I would add “fake” to The Crazy, too. Your Trumbo anecdote illustrates how absolutely malleable and situational muh principles are in the Banana Empire. Trumbo, for those who don’t know, is held up as an exemplar of free speech and thought yet never hesitated to destroy the lives of those he found distasteful, a trait I suspect is not much discussed in his recent film hagiography, which I was too busy breathing to watch. A fiery ending with billowing mushroom clouds is a given, yet as flesh peels from skulls claims will be made it was totes worth it and it isn’t as bad as it seems.

            Z posted a link on his gab a couple of months ago to a 2 hour David Irving presentation.  He said he really got cancelled when he released Hitler’s War in the 1970s.  There is a video of George Lincoln Rockwell (on youtube) giving a speech in some university where he talks about all the talks he has had cancelled.  This was in the 60s.  All the same tactics were being used in the 60s with GLR and with Irving in the 70s.

        I lived in Ft Smith Arkansas from 92-96 (business relo).  It’s just a little town, that’s seen better days. People were interested in hunting, NASCAR and football. I never found anyone political, altho they all hated Bubba. I think Buckley opened a map and found Ft Smith for his fake letter. If he had to choose Arkansas, Bentonville would have been better.

        Christopher Buckley (William’s son) repaid the libel that William F. imposed on his own father, and threw in his mother for good measure.  His book,Losing Mum and Pup, portrays his mother as a pathological liar and William F as an uninterested, self-centered father who contemplated suicide towards the end of his life.  What goes around, comes around, I suppose.Another example of cancel culture involvingNational Reviewwas the termination from further writing for NR of John Derbyshire, for daring to speak frankly and not altogether favorably about blacks in an article for another publication.  That termination was engineered by Rich Lowry, following the NR tradition established by Buckley.  It’s a shame, because I began reading NR in 1979 and continued well into the 1980s, and it helped me on my journey to the dissident right.The limitations on expression today are very much like those in medieval Europe–you could express opinions and debate theological matters, but the debate had to be kept within certain limits.  If you went outside those limits, you became a heretic, and could even be executed if you persisted in your heresy.  The age of free inquiry may have been a brief moment in history.

            Yes, Derb was cancelled after giving a white version of “The Talk”.  The original version of The Talk was supposedly given by black parents to black children about evil white people.  Derb told the opposite and factually correct narrative about black white interaction, and Lowry cut him.  This was right after Trayvon was rightfully dispatched by GZ and the media was playing up the hate whitey routine , a lot.

        That opening letter was really more “straw man” than “macguffin” but yeah it’s so ham-fisted it’s insulting, reads like one of those gay-guy actorswith the brand new “hillbilly” ballcapon YouTube is speaking it.
Embarrassed I ever thought well of Buckley.  Gatekeeping back then was merciless, as a young, casual conservative never even heard of some of these guys.  Contrast that with people like Tucker today whose stuff I’ve watched more frequently *after* he was “deplatformed”.  (Or heck, even Sailer, whose stuff I probably never would have read if NR kept him under their banner).

        So funny thing last week I was at my dad’s forced to watch the electric Jew with him, and there was some kind of interview going with some guy named Perlman (not Ron Perlman but similarly shaped head) who had written some kind of book about Buckley.  According to him when he was 19 he just happened to write a letter to Buckley who took him on as a protege, which I assume is the interview dancing around this guy being Buckley’s rent boy.

            VladTepes site discusses the difficult to understand concept of dialectics- dialectical speech, dialectical thinking, the infamous two-tongued pilpul, instinctive hypocrisy, the outright lying and resolute distortion by leftists and sociopathic narcissists.That is, the feminist brained.You see, dialectics is the practice of reading between the lines.Rather than listening to “facts” as a white man intends, they listen, trying to read between the lines. Trying to see what’sbehindthe words.Thus, they speak a different language…because they speak from the same basis. The real message is not what they are saying, but only intelligible to someone who “gets the gist” of what theyreallymean…such as, another politician.And they think a Tradissident or rightwing is talking to them in the same way, not “listening” as they listen. Thus, you just don’t understand, you thicc Neanderthal you. You’re not from the right tree.We use codewords and esoteric messaging, and so do they.Compare dis right “jogger” and woke left “urban youth.”

As opposed to the Orient, which is the East. We used to use (or be allowed to use) the non-pejorative term “Oriental” instead of what is now “Asian” in common parlance.

        I have an interesting background in the context of this subject. In the 1970s and early 80s I was associated with the core of the “neo-conservative” movement. That was an organization called Social Democrats USA, a remnant of the Socialist Party of Norman Thomas. SDUSA was the organization from which the neocons sprang. It was a faction originally of Trotskyists centered around City University of New York, and a professor there named Max Schachtman, who was a former associate of Trotsky himself.It was a small organization, and so I became acquainted with people in it and associated with it such as Norman Podhorrid, Irving Krystol, Jean Kirkpatrick, Richard Perle, Carl Gershman, Tom Khan, etc. These guys actually invented the term “neo-conservatives” themselves sometime in the 1970s; only later would they deny association with the term. I like to call them neo-Trots.The neo-Trots had figured out that the Socialist Party was going nowhere, so they figured they could gain power by taking over the labor movement and through it the Democratic Party. They were successful in gaining a foothold in the AFL-CIO, partly through the American Federation of Teachers. Tom Khan, for instance, became the right-hand man to AFL-CIO President George Meany. But they weren’t successful in controlling it. Nor could they take over the Democratic Party, because the New Left was there first, and had far more people (I should point out that the SDUSA was pro-Vietnam war). So they turned to the Republican Party, starting with the Reagan campaign in 1990 (before that they regarded Reagan as a stumbling moron). This was more successful, in part because Republicans were dumber than Democrats at the time, and regarded anyone who had read a few books and could speak in complete sentences as an intellectual.Before that happened I had bailed out and decided that real conservatism was a better fit. So I got involved with the Republicans independently, and wound up working in the Senate and later the Reagan White House. There I witnessed perhaps the first example of cancellation, when the neo-Trots put the kibosh on the nomination of Mel Bradford as head of the National Endowment for the Humanities, around 1985. Bradford was a distinguished professor who had dared challenge the sainthood of Abraham Lincoln. He was thoroughly trashed by the usual suspects, and this brought into the open the conflict between the neos and the paleos.Later I also became friends with Joe Sobran. By the way, his background was Ruthenian, or as they’re called now, Ukrainian. One of my favorite of his aphorisms was, “Politicians don’t have principles. They have positions.” As I remember it, Buckley was very open to him about his subservience to the Establishment, and tried to get him to go along. I seem to recall that the final betrayal was triggered not by a column, but by a speech Sobran gave somewhere criticizing the Sacred Ally. Buckley was a fake intellectual and a real snake; and I’ve seen evidence that he got the funds to start National Review from the CIA.Anyway, Sobran lost his column by accepting the Vice Presidential nomination of something called the Constitution Party in 2000. His friends warned him it was a bad idea, because his column was the only thing keeping him afloat financially at the time, but he had begun drinking fairly heavily at that point, which reinforced his stubborn streak. His column space was taken over by none other than Ann Coulter. He never got it back, and afterwards survived on the proceeds from a monthly newsletter. It was a very sad end for a brilliant man.

        You mentioned Buckley’s plainly bogus story of a 1937 Sharon CT crossburning.  Yes he was a hopeless liar but he was not really creative enough for total fabrication.  That ridiculous story was probably a riff on the actual 1944 vandalism perpetrated by his sisters on a Sharon Episcopal church, after the priest broke a local taboo and sold his house to a Jew. Paternal table talk was apparently involved in the real incident as well.   The vandalism was reported in the local paper,  The Lakeville Journal.Unlike some my loathing of Buckley has been seamless.  His famous encounter with an opponent even more vicious, Gore Vidal, on ABC at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, is a reliable source of joy.  To get to the black heart Buckley, I recommend “Parry and Thrust” by Jim Holt, in the Fall 2018 issue of Lapham’s Quarterly.  Holt notes Buckley’s role as a conservative gatekeeper and the impact of that 1944 incident on what I suppose we have to call his “character”.   Also its an excellent piece of writing.

        I think it’s only right to give the full quotation. The envy part is important:The concept of envy — the hatred of the superior — has dropped out of our moral vocabulary. Liberalism has fuzzy ideas of historical guilt, but not original sin, or pride, or envy, which is pride’s obverse. The idea that white Christian civilization is hated more for its virtues than its sins doesn’t occur to us, because it’s not a nice idea. Not that its sins aren’t considerable; but to the envious, sin is more forgivable than virtue.Western man towers over the rest of the world in ways so large as to be almost inexpressible. It’s Western exploration, science, and conquest that have revealed the world to itself. Other races feel like subjects of Western power long after colonialism, imperialism, and slavery have disappeared. The charge of racism puzzles whites who feel not hostility, but only baffled good will, because they don’t grasp what it really means: humiliation. The white man presents an image of superiority even when he isn’t conscious of it. And, superiority excites envy. Destroying white civilization is the inmost desire of the league of designated victims we call “minorities.”

To most people nowdays, who barely think at all,bigotrymeans hating people of other races. But bigotry doesn’t always mean that sort of hate, or indeed any sort of hate. More basically, it means a sort of stupidity: indignant bafflement that others can disagree with you, along with an inability to comprehend why they do and a refusal to deal with the reasons they actually give.

        I read not only NR in the 80s but most of WFB’s Cold War spy novels (I think he fancied himself the American LeCarre).  Blackford Oakes was our guy as he matched wits with a host of dastardly commies in “Saving the Queen”, Stained Glass”, and “Operation Mongoose”.  He was a brilliant writer for sure.  Also used to watch his weekly talk show on PBS, Firing Line. You can still find this show on YT I’m pretty sure.  The show with George Wallace c 1968 or 69 (before he was shot) was incredible.

where is your Weds podcast wirh RamZPaul?
is there a unique link to it?some of the trouble I have with folks on our side, is that they are sometimes on obscure websites (not saying you and Paul are).bur it’s so hard to find them, and then if I do, it involves about 4 click-through, to get to the page where I can press Play… but I can’t ever relocate it again!

            I mean, except that the former isn’t true. No one hated the Jews. They just wanted pornographers and bankers out of the country. No country needs Jews, and they add nothing of value to any society. The Germans were just trying to do what people on this site want: train our own children to run society, rather than relying on foreigners, be they jew or not, to run the upper echelons.

        Oh for Christ’s sake, Z-man, did you have to stir up the anti-semites? They already have a splinter in their brains so big that they think that Hamas and Hezbollah are worthy of sympathy. I haven’t ready the comment thread yet, but I can imagine what its like.
Yep, there it is: First comment in. Like waving red meat in front of a pack of hyenas.

            Funny stuff. I’m serious. I can go weeks without hearing a thing about Israel so long as I stay away from the comment section and selected ‘Tubers. I have no idea how it’s possible to hear Jan say, “Israel, Israel, Israel!” 24/7 unless one lives in an echo chamber. The closest thing to it I can imagine is picking at a scab.

            Maybe you and Anna can commiserate together, but let’s try something different.  Please give us a reason why we should support you people.  To me, it’s abundantly clear you not only do not have OUR interests in mind, but actively work to our detriment and have been for millennia.  Again, anything short of effusive praise is considered antisemitism to you people.  It’s tiresome and we don’t care anymore.  I also like how you try to associate us with Hamas and Hezb’Allah, insinuating we’re dolts.  Remarkable you haven’t updated your firmware and still expect these sophomoric tactics to work, especially here.  The decline in jewish rhetorical skills is really concerning, how the mighty have fallen!

            I have no love for muslims or arabs. If I had my way, they would all be deported regardless of their citizenship status.
However, I have developed a begrudging respect for Hamas. They are committed to defending their people against impossible odds.
Whether you agree or not, they believe that the j3ws are trying to steal their land and they are willing to die to prevent that. Sure, islam has made them crazy, but I still see an indomitable commitment to defending their people and their homeland.
Like a small dog fighting to the death against a bear.

More like a nest of hornets attacking a dog. That’s why I also refuse to respect the Palis, either.
