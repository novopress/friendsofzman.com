        (Blushing deeply)  Yes, yes, I meant to say ALLEN West, and was just hoping nobody would notice my blunder.  In my defence, I‚Äôll say that my husband and I have been watching the Rifftrax version of the 1949 Batman serial every evening this week, and I guess the power of suggestion was just too much to fight off.

        Well, Dr. Mabuse, while your mention of Thomas Sowell and Clarence Thomas are quite correct, I have to disagree about Adam West. I don‚Äôt see him as a great African-American conservative talent because ‚Äîa) They don‚Äôt come much whiter than Adam West.b) His mayoral tenure of Quahog, RI is mixed at the very best.c) His early record in early days of crimefighting left something to be desired, as every single masked criminal that he managed to foil would just show up again five episodes later.So I have my doubts.  üôÇIn all seriousness, though, it is worth noting that, while I genuinely wish the GOP was better at appealing to minorities, witness that,within the party, itiswell and truly color-blind.  If you are a person of color who shares our conservative values on family, faith, governance, and economics, we absolutelydo not carewhat color you are, except that we might be that much more pleased as punch to have you. As opposed to the Democrats, where whatever color, faith, or sexual sub-group you are in is first and foremost, all else to follow from that. I would hope we could figure out how to capitalize on that truth at some point.

        I was one of those naive northern suburbanites. I grew up in a county that had more chiropractors than blacks (back then). Ocean County, N.J. White flight community. Back in the 70s, almost everyone else came from somewhere else. Some were racist. I wasn‚Äôt. In fact, I‚Äôm still not racist. I don‚Äôt think black people have any less intrinsic value than any other race, and are just as precious if not more precious in the eyes of God. However, what I thought were social dysfunction issues in the black community turned out to have a deeper cause ‚Ä¶ and I stopped talking about race.What changed my mind about race was this: I was put in charge of hiring for my department. We used to give the Wonderlich test. No matter what the education and experience, the highest any black person scored in the four years I was on the hiring team was a score that was equivalent to 101 IQ. It was a small sample, a dozen maybe, but I was blown away at the difference. These were four-year grads with experience at good organizations.I had previously taught at an all-black high school ‚Äî I thought the problem was socio-economic, why HSers were writing at a second or third grade level in high school.We got a problem. Blacks just don‚Äôt have much native intelligence and there may further be genetic behavioral issues as well.I figured this out about 15 years ago. I was out of ideas at that point. My philosophy had been if we can maintain economic and social freedom in the U.S., in one more generation from now, around 2050, society will be so integrated no one will really think much about race.But if money and freedom and anti-racist attitudes won‚Äôt help, then we got a problem and I‚Äôm out of ideas except perhaps Christian ones about loving neighbor as oneself.

        ‚ÄúIn private, I‚Äôm hearing white people speak in ways that would have made Archie Bunker blush.‚Äù-ZThe tide has been coming in on that one for a while. Always out of earshot of ‚Äúothers,‚Äù Whites are returning to a voice from the past. An echo of a truth once well-learned and established.The reintroduction of nigger, coon, fill in your favorite, in White polite society, including the ladies, is a cathartic acknowledgement of unity. A binding force, once practiced and understood, to protect the tribe.It is, in my humble view, an expression of the basic natural instinct of self-defense. And, may I add, not a moment too soon.

        Southerners who move to New England immediately notice the lack of black people. They soon learn that native whites know nothing about black people. That‚Äôs part of why whites in the north are so gung ho for racial justice. They imagine blacks are just like them, but with black skin and better at basketball.A great example of this was a few years ago when the New England Patriots played in New Orleans over Thanksgiving weekend. Loads of New Englanders decided to head down for some partying in the Big Easy. They did not know that it was the weekend of the Soul Bowl. This is the annual game between Grambling and Southern, two black colleges. The result is the Big Easy is crawling with blacks from all over the south.The pasty-faced Patriots fans suddenly found themselves eyeball deep in black culture. That weekend there were half a dozen shootings in the French Quarter, right in the tourist areas. Thousands of extras from hip-hop videos were milling around the city. It was hilarious watching the white people suddenly facing a reality they never knew existed.

        Growing up, as a teenager I lived in a wealthy suburb near an urban area in the 1990s.  Hip-hop dominated pop culture ‚Äì it was the cool thing in the white suburbs among it‚Äôs sheltered denizens.At the time, Section 8 housing policies were happening, and a number of urban blacks were transplanted into the posh suburb.  They were immediately popular, as they were so ‚Äòauthentic‚Äô and had street cred. etc.Over the years though, they burned their bridges through blatant robberies and drug deals.  Even among the suburban whites who were into that sort of thing themselves they had made enemies.I went off to college and when I came back, I was surprised to see a big shift in the attitude of the community (among the young people of course), that was at first welcoming to urban blacks, but was now very anti-urban black. They were hated period.  This didn‚Äôt seem to extend to normal middle class blacks, but a line was clearly drawn.

        But the Republicans are still chasing the will-‚Äòo-‚Äòthe-wisp of a black candidate who will beat the Democrats at their own game. They insist he‚Äôs out there somewhere, and always proffer the same 3 names in proof: Thomas Sowell, Adam West, Clarence Thomas. And‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs it. There‚Äôs no great reservoir of black conservatives just waiting to be tapped; there‚Äôs a tiny, unrepresentative fringe of rare, intelligent men who‚Äôd be hooted down as ‚Äúun-black‚Äù the first time they tried to run for national office.  And it‚Äôs true: they ARE un-black.  They don‚Äôt represent the black community.  Whenever that community is give a choice, it goes for the cheating, lazy shyster. That‚Äôs what they want, and it‚Äôs what they insist upon having.It‚Äôs so obvious, that I would never trust a black politician, no matter how good he looks on paper. They ALL are vulnerable to the tribal pull. Mark Steyn once wrote about Muslims that, without exception, you can be having a nice, sensible conversation with them, and then they‚Äôll go and say something completely insane. It always happens. So it is with blacks. You may think this is someone who thinks as you do, but without fail, at some point they will crumple to conform to the black ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù.

        The last universally recognized black figure to believe in a colorblind society was, as far as I know, Frederick Douglass.
