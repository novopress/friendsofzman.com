        We always said that the ‚Äúleft‚Äù would turn xenophobic if the immigrants were white, and it only took a mere 59 to prove it.
The key word in the 14th amendment is ‚Äúand.‚Äù As in, ‚Äúand subject to the jurisdiction thereof.‚Äù If the authors had intended birthright citizenship, they‚Äôd have left that phrase out, since the previous phrase, ‚Äúall persons born or naturalized in the United States,‚Äù would have established birthright citizenship without any modification. But modify it they did.

        So what with one thing and another, I think Trump‚Äôs February Executive Order was a bit of a stretch.I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not necessary to wait until the death squads are on the move to act. To quote someone, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.‚ÄùThe white population of South Africa is about four and a half million‚Ä¶.‚Ä¶¬†The country has an estimated five million illegal aliens in residence, three million just from Zimbabwe.So you‚Äôre saying that White South Africans are outnumbered just by recent illegal immigrants alone?* Ever heard the term ‚ÄúWhite replacement?‚Äù*Of course the entire Zulu and Bantu population is descended from illegal immigrants.Personally, I think Whites should take back South Africa and Rhodesia, but that‚Äôs just me.

        Good morning, Mr Derbyshire.  Thank you for this program in particular and for all your weekly Radio Derb episodes.  Former Episcopal priest here who is familiar with the ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù and left it behind along with other clergy and parishioners. (The anti-White racism was way down the list of problems, but I am grateful you bring it up). The vicar of my own home parish went Orthodox and I Catholic.  I hope your refuge among Baptists is good for your faith. God bless you and your family

        Quote:Birthright Citizenship was not meant for people taking vacations to become permanent Citizens of the United States of America, and bringing their families with them, all the time laughing at the ‚ÄúSUCKERS‚Äù that we are!End quote.Like too many of the President‚Äôs posts, that doesn‚Äôt actually make much sense,Makes perfect sense to me. What part is hard to comprehend?On birthright citizenship I‚Äôm betting they‚Äôll leave it as is, telling us if we want it changed we should lobby Congress to amend the Amendment. Which of course they never will.We‚Äôve waited too long. We can no longer muster a supermajority in our own country. The only solution will come from someplace other than the ballot box.

            I agree. The anchor baby scam (aka Birthright Citizenship) must be terminated. To do that, we will need five or more honest judges on the Supreme Court. That‚Äôs all it will take. It won‚Äôt solve the main problem, but it‚Äôs an essential first step.
If this scam does finally end, the Jews will go ballistic. They always do. Fun to watch it.

        The first religious duty that fell to King Charles on his succeeding to the throne was his constitutional duty to swear to protect the independence of the Church of Scotland.  Independent from what, you may wonder?  From the Church of England, mainly.

            That‚Äôs the Presbyterian Church *of* Scotland, not the (much smaller) Anglican Church *in* Scotland, which is what Derb refers to above.

                Aye.  But the Anglican Church in Scotland doesn‚Äôt use Anglican in its title: it is the Episcopalian Church of Scotland.  Which is why yours calls itself Episcopalian too.
Of course public conversation in Scotland simplifies things and refers simply to ‚Äúthe English Church‚Äù or ‚ÄúEnglish Kirk‚Äù, or at least it did in the Borders when I was a lad. It wasn‚Äôt said with any animus that I can remember ‚Äì it was simply a description.

        Hi Mr Derbyshire, how wonderful to be able to leave a comment! Reading the transcript, you used the term anti-whiteness. I believe the correct term would be antiwhitism and that the difference between the terms when defined is quite marked. There is a chap named Jason Kuhne on youtube who explains it very plan should you car to look. As always, thanks for giving me a great start to my Saturday!
