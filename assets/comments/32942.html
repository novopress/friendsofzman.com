        “Covenant, the Crucible, and the Creed”Well folks, the fourth “C” is the Currency. America now is just a dollar bill rammed up the rears of the world by NGOs, the US Air Force and the SWIFT system. At home, America is a marketplace run by Elites whose cartels – banking, sickcare, internet/technology – maintain hegemony through surveillance and the importation of savages. Abroad, our dollars make the world safe for Israel, technology cartels and gay sex. There’s no Covenant because there’s no people; no Crucible because savages don’t assimilate; no Creed because a dollar is nihilistic.

            “Is”and“Was”.  Recall that a big reason the Articles of Confederation were scrapped was because there was no central authority to issue currency (the horror!).  Certainly the thought of the fate of the currency was a big driver for the Civil War as well.

            The problem with American society is nobody knows what the fuck it even is anymore.The culture seems to be nigs and fags making monkey noises on the screens and jumping on and burning cars irl. Not to mention preying on our young and eviscerating them.Oh boy do they love that, White people made them poor and stupid you see. If not for us, they would be living in Wakanda apparently.Most of them seem to believe this. It’s insane.And the “Pride Parades”…. fucking child sacrifice rituals. A pedo who shakes his fucking dick at a child in public should be immediately arrested and charged with something very severe.Meanwhile, wall street prints more and more fiat so they can afford that 5th mansion on some island somewhere.How would you even begin to fix this mess?

        The people demanding we save the world absolutely have on moral right to judge the world, or us.  We used to have a national identity of sorts, with regional flavors, when the country was 90% White, but that’s out the window now.  The best we can probably hope for now is a region or two that can duplicate that figure.  I doubt there’ll be much cooperation as well.  The leadership over the past couple hundred years has really screwed the pooch and the great American experiment is over.

            The people demanding we save the world largely arrived in America between 1880 and 1914. They managed to usurp control of government and the institutions from the country’s WASP elites during the latter half of the 20th century. They comprise 80 percent of senior officials in the outgoing Biden administration, and a tribesman is currently heading up the transition team selectingprospectiveappointees for Trump.

                I was in Greece a month ago with the wife, and went on tour to Delphi. The tour guide asked where we all were from, and our ancestry. After the all of the damned Yankee tourists said where they were from and that they were either Irish or Italian, I stated that I am from the Great and Sovereign state of Tennessee and that my ancestors came from Virginia. The tour guide was confused and the rest of the little busload of tourists shifted a little uncomfortably. The communal “Trump is Evil hahaha” chatter stopped though. How did they know?

                    Those “nation of immigrants” pseudo-Yankees probably never met a genuine heritage American before.  One of the many reasons we moved to the Ozarks was to live amongst heritage Americans.  And my husband (half Italian half Irish) is on record stating the smartest thing any of his ancestors ever did was move to what used to be America.  He has no other allegiances, unlike too many immigrant descendants.

                        Those allegiances to the old country of immigrant descendants are because there is no new country. Just an Idea of a country.They celebrate their Irish roots, German, whatever because thats how they get around the anti-White culture of FUSA. There is no White America. But there is sorta this White Ireland or White Germany thing that goes without saying. Its always about NOT saying.Over time of not saying, people just stop knowing.Part of the 23andme trick was clever to propagate this notion implanted during the long march.Not only is FUSA a “nation of immigrants”, a “melting pot”, but you can now celebrate some strands of nucleotides from all over. Just not here.First they created “identity”. Then all the ways to make identity everything that your people used to be. Pre-dating your identity to the FUSA circumvents your claim to your USA Heritage and validates the mythology that we are but interlopers and thieves and abusers and our time has run out.Fungible Citizens of the world, for which the time is long past to hand our civilization to the next strands of DNA.

                    I get alot of angry soy faces when I state that I am Canadian. And I am not ashamed of it.White shitlibs are mad that I don’t apologize or have some other identity, like 25% Irish, a fag, 1% native, whatever. Rootless immigrants are mad that I actually feel Canadian, because they don’t, and they never can, and never will.It’s not a lie. I feel very Canadian. And I am. Because a Canadian is an Anglo -Saxon settler. Similar to a Tennessean. We are different , and we refuse to assimilate, and there’s nothing they can do about it. Because we’re real.The shitlibs and their immigrant pets can try and run us out-but they won’t. Because we have nowhere to go. I can’t just get on the plane back to India when things go south. Or Italy, for that matter.

                    Quite right. Monticello was preserved by a successful Jew who bought it from Jefferson’s bankrupt estate. I guess my point was that Jewish immigrants from the Pale of Settlement were sufficiently great in number and socially active enough that they upended the politics of heretofore Anglo-dominated America. Though it could be argued that their brethren who arrived in the 1930s were also important in that respect.

        Being left alone, Whites will create healthy and prosperous societies again.  What has to be different this time though, is to erase the brainwashing and indoctrination, and become more hardened and less gullible to guilt and the lies of equality.

            You are right except we’re not going to be left alone for the rest of this century.  I think we’re going to have to stand up for our right to have our own communities and schools even if the country is full of non-whites.

                Whites have no innaterights in AINO other than those permitted by the massive non-White world that has now squeezed in with us.  White schools and communities in a non-White country?  I think Whites will be lucky to have an Orania if we depend on “standing up for our rights” in a multiracial entity.  Genuinely standing up means having our own country, not living at non-white ‘sufferance.’

                    Not sure we want an Orania.  My reading on such from SA’ers is it’s really intended to be a modern “Masada”.  A prepared stronghold to flee to when the Blacks finally implement the “final solution”.  The hope being that the rest of the world will come to the rescue of the remaining Whites who retreat there if they can buy time.

                            Well, yes on the hope of White SA’ers, but no I don’t think they’ll get that help.  And to tell the truth, better to die fighting the savages—more power to them—but they’d be better off to take Putin up on his immigration offer (see recent news of such).

                                They certainly would be better off taking up that offer. Hell, if he made such an offer to traditionalists in AINO, I’d consider it very strongly. But our situation isn’t quite as dire as the white SAs. When the savages begin closing in on the last bastion of whites in SA, the western Power Structure will air lift packages of salt, pepper, bay leaves and oregano for the canibals’ cauldrons.

I remember the ridicule of Orania at first, battered tin-and-scrap shacks, with barefoot children in rags playing in bleak rivulets.
How far they have come…I cannot help but tear up with pride and gratitude at how noble my People are.

        The Civil War was about slavery the same way the 2nd Iraq War was about ‘weapons of mass destruction’. It was not the reason the war was started, but the fig leaf of propaganda necessary to get the poorly informed fighting men to kill and die in it. No, I am not a ‘Southern Apologist’. All my ancestors fought for the evil ‘Union’ because they were poorly informed.They were used like food animals, and their suffering and death destroyed the old republic and instantiated an empire which, while a net force for good in spite of their numerous failings, was in the end too corrupt and shortsightedly greedy to defend itself against conquest by the International Jew. Once suspension of the Constitution is tolerated (damn that monstrous whoreslave of merchants, Abraham Lincoln) by not being punished with hanging, repeated occurrences are 100% inevitable. There is no rule of law. There is only rule of power.General Robert E. Lee“The consolidation of the States into one vast empire, sure to be aggressive abroad and despotic at home, will be the certain precursor of ruin which has overwhelmed all that preceded it.”

            In the fullness of time, I think we call the Civil War the “War For American Identity.” There was a long and public debate about nationalism in the 19th century that greatly informed the principals on both sides. Long ago I said that the current crisis is really just a long delayed addressing of issues left unaddressed after the war. Not the least of which was the reintegration of elites outside the North into the national elite.

                The struggle of the immediate future will be a likely futile effort to prevent the exodus of the toys of the Northern elite–the financial markets, corporate headquarters, brain-filled Ivies. Sure, there will be zombie versions–Harvard campus is not a proposition university, nor is Lower Manhattan a proposition financial zone, in that they have a physical presence–but shells likely are the future there. Atomization was impossible to confine to the lumpenproletariat and that appears to be accelerating.

                In the meantime, America absorbed a bunch of new elites. Well, elites is the wrong word. The right word is vying factions who hold power. Having power and being elite are not the same though not mutually exclusive. In any case, we continue to absorb even more new ethnic power factions. The first set got the GAE to secure them a land. The new sets come from gargantuan countries that are emerging empires in their own right.If the Yankees and the Cavaliers could never mend it and share power, how are at least 6 distinct ethnic/racial factions going to do it? It would be very difficult if we were on a growth trajectory and the ethnic upsets were emergent and bottom up. However, one of the factions long let that genie out of the bottle in a Juvenalian hi-low to bash one of the other factions. Not only has it not subsided it is being inflamed to a new crescendo. So we are in a downward spiral and that 70 year game ripped apart the fabric of society.The current power factions seem to get along because they live on top of the University-Corporate-Government-DollarRegime largesse disbursement center. If that is in descent how do those stivers act toward each other?It is going to be interesting. It will get extremely interesting if the one faction who dissolved and forfeited its identity finds itself wanting to assert itself. I pray every day for things to get extremely interesting only because of that faction finally getting it together and tracing its roots back to the beginning and asserting the claims that follow from that.

        The presidential election in a nutshell.
The people behind Harris represent the Jew/WASP (mostly Jewish, let’s be honest) elite’s desire, dare I say need, to tell the world how to act, whether we or their Levant cousins act that way or not, while, simultaneously, disregarding, if not disdaining, actual Americans and their problems.
Trump and Vance represent the desire to turn our gaze homeward and try to make what’s left of America a better place. (Granted, both will back Israel unconditionally, but, well, breaking that link is a bridge way too far at this moment.)

        “[America] has, in the lapse of nearly half a century, without a single exception, respected the independence of other nations while asserting and maintaining her own. She has abstained from interference in the concerns of others…Wherever the standard of freedom and Independence, has been or shall be unfurled, there will her heart, her benedictions and her prayers be.Butshe goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator only of her own.She will recommend the general cause by the countenance of her voice, and the benignant sympathy of her example.She well knows that by once enlisting under other banners than her own, were they even the banners of foreign Independence, she would involve herself beyond the power of extrication, in all the wars of interest and intrigue, of individual avarice, envy, and ambition, which assume the colors and usurp the standard of freedom.The fundamental maxims of her policy would insensibly change fromlibertytoforce.The frontlet upon her brow would no longer beam with the ineffable splendor of Freedom and Independence; but in its stead would soon be substituted an Imperial Diadem, flashing in false and tarnished lustre the murky radiance of dominion and power. She might become the dictatress of the world. She would be no longer the ruler of her own spirit…”-John Quincy Adams, 1821

        It’s been widely documented and discussed that Colonial America was settled by different groups from different parts of Britain, Scotland and Ireland, often with radically different political ideas…The Puritans who settled New England and the Cavaliers who settled tidewater Virginia were never going to agree on many things..and the Scots-Irish in the mountains weren’t going to agree with either..When Andrew Jackson became President, the wealthy Puritans and their banker allies were furious, and vowed never to allow such un-anointed interlopers again…Ultimately, the Civil War was a fight between the Puritans, Jews and their allies in the industrial north against the Cavaliers in the agrarian south…It wrecked the country, and at the end everyone reconciled, acknowledged the rights of the other,  and tried to forget what had gone on…But that reconciliation has been destroyed by the radicals who seized control of America after Brown vs Board of Education..that group also invited many non-assimilable minorities into the US….It doesn’t seem likely that this jigsaw puzzle can be put together again..It was a miracle that it happened in 1776, and miracles don’t usually repeat…

                    They were market-makers in the South—just as on Wall Street today—to the extent that the slave auctions were forced to close on Jewish holy days. I reject the term “ally.” North or South, they cared only for their own. Niggling aside, I wholeheartedly concur with everything in your post.

                    Opposing factions in Britain supported either Industrialism in the North with Irish and Slavic labor, or control of the textile industry in the South under the Tudor system of raw goods out, manufactured products in.The completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 was what I think some were trying to prevent, as British schemes have long depended on hindering their global trade competitors. Russia, Germany, and Japan lit up with the idea of rail corridors inside their nations boosting industrialization after the Golden Spike was driven.Eventually this led to MacKinder’s fear that land rail would connect the oceans to the north and south, erasing British shipping’s necessity, and the Trans-Siberian and Baghdad-to-Berlin lines proved such fears realistic.

                Jews are not a monolithic hivemind. Ashkenazi banksters (with gold from Europe and an eye to profiting off of industrialization) certainly played a role in the ‘North’ but the ‘South’ had about 20% of their slaves owned by Sephardim.different ricebowls -&gt; different alliances made with different foolish goyimJust like 1942 American coasts were the ‘happy hunting ground’ for U-boats because of our ruling classes’ inability to shift easily to wartime thinking, the social and political structures that America was started with made America the ‘happy hunting ground’ for the IJ, with our then WASP ruling class completely unable to see non-kinetic war as a threat. That another group would undertake a multi-generational genocidal war against them while mostly staying within the boundaries of law (while steadily modulating that boundary) simply was not believed by enough of them. Bless Henry Ford and many others for trying to awaken the rest.

        “Maybe in the end, we learn that the true American identity is no identity at all. We are simply a diverse collection of people who agree to cooperate,…”How is this even a question?  We were *never* quite a people—as in “blood and soil”.  Things held together fairly well however because we *were* a European nation.  Nations of Europe had much shared history since the Romans.  Conflicts sure, but much inherited history, experience, and values in common—not to say the least was universal Christianity and the common morality stemming from that belief system.That all went away—well, we threw it away—in the early 60’s (perhaps even the early 1900’s) when we invited/allowed huge swaths of non-European, and non-Christians onto our shores.  Hubris made us mad with the concept of equality and universal suffrage.  We could do anything. We were Americans.  We won WWII.  We went to the moon and back. It was to be the American century. We looked to conquer the world and lost our home front.Those whom the gods wish to destroy, they first drive mad.  And so it goes…

            As one self-proclaimedinternet oracle has nonetheless correctly said, America and the modern notion of Western Civilization were a three-legged stool:  Heirs of Greek andRoman thought, Christianity, and White people.  Each element is insufficient by itself but utterly vital for the final product.  That is why all the non-Whites now in AINO are destroying it – they lack one or more of those foundations.

            I think we had an identity. The USA in the 20th century was a melting pot of predominantly Christian diaspora predominantly from Northern Europe and what used to be the Roman Empire and its frontiers. Then the powers that be twisted that into a melting pot of all of humanity when they ran out of slave labor peasants from war devastated Europe who wanted to resettle here.Like I have been saying lately, human exploitation is the American way. Whether it’s slaves, cheap immigrant labor, illegals or offshoring all of our dirty work that gives you cancer to Nike factories in Asia, that’s the way America has always prospered. Just be thankful you’re the slaver and not the slave.There’s an old episode of “The Fugitive” where Dr. Richard Kimble is hiding out among a bunch of illegal farm workers. They keep harassing him because they thought he was a Fed whose job was to get them deported. This was in the early or mid 1960s. Just goes to show that the issues never change no matter how much time we waste arguing about them.“Operation Wetback” was a failure.

I don’t particularly agree with the above, but there was a point to it.  Remove the wording wrt “America” and replace it with Capitalism and such conclusion becomes more understandable.

                    What do you have against what I wrote? That’s essentially true isn’t it? That is, unless you want to limit the definition of an “American” to the people used to lynch our people down south?
It’s never been framed as exploitation, but isn’t that what it is? We’ve always had illegals and looked the other way except for a brief interlude during the Eisenhower administration. Same with low wage immigrants, slaves, people sniffing carcinogenic solvents for 25 cents a day while gluing your Air Jordans together, etc.

                I also think Nick is basically correct here. The closest America ever came to a common identity was in the post-war years, 1945-1965. In a country that was 85 % White and 90% Christian, a more or less unitary culture developed based around victory, prosperity and progress (generically defined technologically and socially). It was shaped by mass media, which had not yet fractured into niches, creating widely shared cultural touchstones and assumptions. Above all, it was confident in itself, believing it had broken the cycles of history, and was a model for the rest of the world. That last bit was its undoing.The consensus and the confidence declined from there, although it was a long fall, with ever smaller echos in the 80s and the early aughts. It finally shattered with the Great Recession, and Obama.

        I’m not convinced that all this talk about freedom and liberty and saving the world wasn’t just a cynical way to play the American people. Was it ever about that, or was it about opening the door so that private interests can loot and pillage to their hearts content? I just look at what happened after the Soviet Union fell. Oh, sure, the US government didn’t didn’t pillage after the USSR fell, but our oligarchs sure did. In fact, the fact that Putin put a stop to it is probably why they hate him so much.

        The rulers of the empire do have a fairly consistent set of core values easily discerned by their actions. These may be taken as what are The American Core Values, what you stand for when you serve these rulers.1.) Anti-White Christian : This is the number one core value of the regime, the foundation upon which all other core values are articulated and expressed in the way the rulers rule. If it is true that defining your primary political raison d’etre in negative terms with respect to another group, i.e. an enemy, makes you in turn a slave to that enemy, then we white christians are in luck. All other core values are consistent with this prime directive.2.) Anti-Democratic : They are openly anti-democratic in their actions and nakedly hostile to any form of actual representative government for the majority of the population. Obviously, they can’t allow the people they hate to have a voice in their governance.3.) Limitless Greed : Revealing the level of contempt they have for the general population they even allow some of their leaders in the economic wing to publicly telegraph the future they desire which is complete economic subjugation and slavery. ‘You will own nothing and you will like it.’ As the manufactured covid panic demonstrated, when they say you will own nothing, they mean even your bodily autonomy and that of your children.4.) Sexual Depravity in General and the Murder and Mutilation of Children in Particular : Destroying the future for their number one enemy by killing off the family and the issue of the family is consistent with their overall genocidal intent. Their sadistic cruelty goes so far they have distorted the law and the ‘moral’ framework that informs it to justify cutting off the sexual organs of children, supposedly on the stated preferences of those victims who are otherwise thought to be incompetent to decide to buy a pack of cigarettes or elect to forgo a vaccination.5.) Inequality Before the Law and Racial Superiority : This is plainly expressed in everyday life as we all experience. There is a superior race, various favored races defined in terms of what they aren’t, and a distinctly unfavored race, frankly identified as such. The favored races and unfavored race are easily identified as such by the laws imposed by the unrepresentative government, the especially lenient treatment granted by regime functionaries to the favored while at the same time the especially harsh treatment exerted on the individual of the unfavored race. Also, the absurdly fawning treatment of the favored and seething hatred expressed for the unfavored in the cultural organs financially controlled by the regime make the official racial hierarchy a universal experience.I could go on but I think this is a decent start at laying out the fundamental American creed, the ideas upon which this nations rulers guide their actions. It is a regime that has zero legitimacy in democratic political terms and less than zero moral claim to its hold of power. What appears to be hypocrisy or chaos at first glance can be understood to the degree that highly accurate prediction of future actions is possible once this model is internalized, especially the prime directive.

                If you think that all we face is “secular do-gooderism grafted onto hedonism,” I wonder how you overlook the obvious hatred of non-traditional whites held by our elites and many non-whites.
There is a hostility, a desire to dispossess if not exterminate, that “secular do-gooderism grafted onto hedonism” fails to explain.

        “Do we care more about the abstract concept of climate change or addressing the slow collapse of our infrastructure?”I see this from a slightly different perspective—say the 10,000 ft level.  Pol’s talk about these “adventures” and it is to their advantage to have them as far away and abstract as possible.  Climate change vs infrastructure is an excellent example.Simply put, even the dumbest rube can tell whether or not you have improved the infrastructure to his benefit, and then vote you out of office when he finds himself the victim of traffic jams, brownouts, and food shortages.  On the other hand, trillions of dollars can be spent (and stolen) on CC with the promise of earth’s “salvation” 50-100 years hence—when all will be dead and unaffected by the “great lie”.  Then it will be on to another fool’s errand.

Well put. It seems as though everything pols waffle on about now, for years, has been ‘abstract and distant’; whereas most folks want issues that are ‘concrete and local’ dealt with.
Not sure I’ll be caring about ‘going green’ when a neighbourhood of Tyrones are stalking me every time I have to walk to work. I wonder what the carbon footprint of a jogger knife attack is? Presumably lower than one using a firearm.

Sign me up.  I got another earful of Condi Rice on a podcast this weekend.  The meddlers always put it as a binary choice:  Endless meddling, or isolationism.  They lack the imagination or the honesty to admit that America should mind it’s own business, and that includes actively engaging with other countries to advance the interests OF ITS OWN CITIZENS.
That last bit seems to plumb evade them.

        I think the remedy is far, far simpler than most people realize. And it is embodied in the first words spoken by Trump after the assassin’s rifle bullet clipped his ear in Butler, PA. “Fight, Fight, Fight!” That is the true American spirit and purpose. We fight, we overcome obstacles, we prevail or die trying. The enemy is within and they are few in number. Our task is clear. Put your fist in the air. Duty calls.

                    The bad Whites will stop you, as they have stopped us in every single corrective process undertaken/proposed.  That is why they must be included.  If they simply sat on the side lines and allowed those interested “others” to fight it out, then yeah—concentrate on those others.

        “The question is whether America will collapse in a heap, exhausted from trying to save the world or will we pull up, realize our folly and return to a sense of purpose rooted in simply being an example to the world?”The USA has been comprehensibly taken over by foreign interests, see the 65 or so standing ovations in the Capitol building to the man the Speaker of the House refers to as “His Excellency.”So at this point it is impossible to pull up because Americans interested in the survival of America are not in control of things.  At some point if the guillotines are deployed in sufficient numbers we might be able to pull up.   I don’t see that happening any time soon.

            A mere upvote seems inadequate to express my agreement.
As anectodal support for your point, I mention my brother, a guy who loves old America, who repeats to me all that he’s heard from Ben Shapiro about Israel’s alleged victories as if these were victories for him and his people.  I am dumbstruck.

                I have neighbors who are nice Christian people.   When we discuss Israel they remind me that the Bible says we must “Stand with Israel.”    I ask them pointedly if they stand by Israel when they bomb hospitals and shoot children in the head.    Or do they stand with them when their political figures, to great public acceptance, state that it would be best to just stave everyone in Gaza to death.
Their reply is always something along the lines of  “Well there is evil in the world but we must still stand by Israel   God tells us so.”

        I think this is giving The Regime too much credit. All of this stuff is just a thin veneer for global domination. The purpose of The Regime is twofold:Create a global shopping mallDominate and rule the global shopping mall by any means necessaryI drive by the mosques that dot the landscape and remember that, “We must fight them over there so we don’t have to fight them here”, didn’t last for a minute after it was uttered. I drive through the endless ethnic colonies that have taken over our cities: A historic town with its signs commemorating Independence War battles and sites is now Koreatown. Then you go through the Mumbai colony that could give a fig about the heritage signs sites and statuary they live amongst. Then you go through the emerging Mogadishustans and the long standing albatross population ghettos that have consumed vast troves of wealth only to be open air litter boxes.All of the idealism and narrative is hollow and fake. Read their inter-comms and white papers and policy reports and it is all right there in plain sight. Their actions confirm their commitment to it.Create a global shopping mall.Dominate and rule the global shopping mall by any means necessaryThe real question is can we survive it and how will we do so in order to still be a significant and large in number people with a positive identity, future and destiny on the other side.

        The original City on the Hill concept was that the USA would serve as an example for other nations. It was eventually perverted into a type of imperialism, in which the USA would impose its own City on the Hill concept on other nations. This type of imperialism is a rationale for endless war and the deleterious baggage that goes with it. Ironically, it has also helped turn the USA into a country nobody would want to emulate, not to mention the grave harm it has caused other nations.

        America has what used to be called “leadership quality.” That phrase seems to have fallen out of the language. It’s called “moral authority” now. (That’sa change from WASP to Jew.) The core of it isbeing an extremely weird deluded asshole who’s a danger to everyone. America is the empire ofthat.Passing judgment or issuing a commandcausesa leader to believe it. That’s what leadership is, what ineffably separates rulers (sociopaths) from us (victims). Being baffling/inaccessible to normal people—thwarting our logic and judgment—ishow leadership works.Newsy example: Hillary, intelligence, MSNBCet al., contrary to literally all evidence, truly believe that Trump is Putin’s sockpuppet (and Putin is a right-wing dictator, etc.)—because they said so, knowing they were lying. Theymade it up, fully consciously. Then they said it, and as it passed it from their mouths to the world,they were telling the truth, an eternal truth extending back and forward through all time.Normal people react to this kind of insanity with passivity—extreme passivity, unto death.What has the “Russia hoax” cost the hoaxers? Nothing. What has it gained them? So far, the military has taken command of the U.S., there will be no next generation of Ukrainians, WWIII is well underway, history (if present) will record Trump as Putin’s stooge, and both of them as neonazis.(Putin deserves it for being a shitlib.)

        As I read Z Man’s explanations of the Covenant, the Crucible, and the Creed national identities, I find myself thinking that these identities do not best explain the present.
Somewhere along the way, the primary motivation of our elites became dispossessing the traditional white people of the USA. Z Man gets at this when he observes that “the coming election is about whether we care more about the fate of Mongolian transgender lesbians or the fentanyl epidemic in Appalachia.”
When did the primary motivation of our elites become anti-traditional white? When the white working class voted for Reagan?

            This sentiment developed in tandem with the so-called “civil rights movement” and continues apace to this day. And, of course, postmodern cultural relativism gave the development a tremendous fillip by depreciating western civilization and transfiguring negroid savagery. Alas, rather than leveling at a stable “equality,” this development morphed into out-and-out negro supremacy and flagrant anti-white racism. And here we are.

            When did the primary motivation of our elites become anti-traditional white? When the white working class voted for Reagan?Some of it is the residue of the elite replacement concept of the Norman Conquest, or at least an attempt to emulate it, so it was present even before the nation’s beginning. From the outset attempts were made to stratify classes in a similar fashion, even though in the American case out of whole cloth. If anything it was far worse in Australia, where debauched and deracinated aspirants to nobility–some once part of it, even–released foxes and ran them with hounds across the Outback, by way of example. Make Jews subsequent replacements for wannabe Norman conquistadors, and it gets dialed to 11. Henry Ford therefore is arguably the greatest American, and I’m open to his Australian equivalent if one even exists. 1088 inexorably led to 1861 which further devolved into 1965, likely the point of no return.

                The sad fact about Australia is that the best of them all was (IKAGO trigger warning) Sir John Monash — even allowing for (((inevitable post facto hagiography))). There simply are and were no truly great (*) Australians. If they had potential for greatness they or their ancestors either emigrated to the USA or Canada or stayed put in the Old Country and climbed the greasy pole.It’s just not a place to breed greatness — look what 40K years’ residence did to the Abos. It is, however, if managed properly a nice spot for mellowing out and not having delusions of grandeur or greatness. Until and unless the Pajeets make a total latrine of it.* The fact that it’s a land of utter mediocrity can easily be proven by reading any Australian promotional blurb and counting how many times the expression ‘World Class’ appears.

        In The Revolution of 1861, the author discusses the North justification for war. A big idea was the fight against the Southern landed aristocracy. They viewed the plantation economy as denying the white working class freedom to own their labor. The North was keeping the1848 revolutionary flame alive. In that sense, too the North thought they were re-fighting a failed international revolution.

            Many failed revolutionaries from 1848 (like Carl Schurz) came here to light the flames of civil war. In the film “Ride with the Devil” (Ang Lee), based on the novel “Woe to Live On,” the main character in Missouri is the son of a German immigrant who joins the Bushwhackers, to the consternation of his father, who tries to send him to St. Louis to avoid the war. The son tells the father he has no intention of hiding out in St. Louis with the other “Lincoln lovers” — and his father is later killed by a Union soldier from their town, who drags his father behind his horse through town after shooting him.

        A good essay. I learned things.‘but he does not get into how this Puritan sensibility evolved in the 19th century during the Civil War to become a civic religion for the ruling elite.’The years around the bellum stoke requisite Nationalist fervor in the North, while puritan and rogue-Quaker sensibilities meld with emerging tikkun olam inflations of a salvationist global mandate.  Morning of the Day of the Expanding Man.  During this period also, both the female-dominated, occultic Spiritualist Movement and the Seneca Falls Convention (1848) added to the nannyist ecstasies that finally resolved in Progressivism.Tikkun olam is rabbinically created doctrine (meaning it’s fake) in which the Big US decides we are now sufficient to appropriate God’s place, sallying forth to Save Humanity (blare trumpets).  Naive, presumptuous, and ludicrous all at once.  Synagogue-of-satan stuff, derived from Lurianic Kabballah of the late medieval period — that rotten gnosticism the tribes carried out of Babylon with them.Apparently, elite life in post-bellum America was comfortable and secure enough to allow harbored pretensions of Being Messiah to All the Little Peop . . . um I mean the world.

            Odd how all the 10,000 books of the full Pharisaic Talmud are legalistic decisions not to comply with Mosaic Law, but how toget around it.
Driving it all is the unstated foundation that the Creation-made world is lacking, that clever tricks and shortcuts are always to prove how the bright boys can do things better.
Mere material quality of life is not enough. It’s like a woman driven by her monthly cycle; for one week a month, she wants to change everything. Then, when the mindless throb has eased, she tells the men to put it all back.

        On the podcast Z linked, he refers to present day Obama as “like seeing a child actor grown up.” Brilliant. I have been trying to come up with an apt description, and things like “has-been” have fallen short. Yes, Obama is Baby Jane.
Great stuff on that episode, Z.

        “Maybe in the end, we learn that the true American identity is no identity at all.”
That’s my humble opinion. If Martin Armstrong’s prognosis is correct, the USA will splinter into three or more autonomous regions by 2032. Certainly the country — rather, the empire — is in “phase change” mode right now.
But what happens when empire dissolve into nation states (e.g., the way the Ottoman empire became the ethnonationalist Turkey)? Ugo Bardi sketches some of the implications here:

                            I get it because trying to craft an identify outside of biology has already failed.  However, efforts to get a White Nationalist movement going in the U.S. have consistently failed (even worse) as well, even in times when the government gave such movements a wide berth.
What’s the fix then?
I don’t have one.  Some people, even well meaning, thoughtful people, like the idea of using religion, but, I don’t think there’s a great chance of success there.

                                    Sorry, too lazy to look it up, but someone had posted about a White nationalist movement in the 1880s that went nowhere.  I’m not a George Lincoln Rockwell fan, but he had no issue getting speaking engagements at universities and whatnot.

        I think the new American culture we see emerging is vastly more nationalist and anti-establishment than we’ve ever seen in this country before.  I always laugh when they break out the “fascist” lingo because man we hate those government fuckers and would see them all fired and their positions eliminated if we could.There are a couple of issues that will need to be rectified for a full realignment.  Namely energy independence and abortion.  The greens and the baby killers are not ones to compromise, and the other side is uninterested in national suicide or baby homicide.But that leaves open field running for this new nationalist/anti-establishment group to break up large corporations, crush Pharma, and break up the domestic Stasi organizations.

        Z-man’s post today reminded me of a quote that I see in my US passport.  It’s from Dwight Eisenhower’s Inaugural Address in 1953:“Whatever America hopes to bring to pass in the world must first come to pass in the heart of America.”This has never made much sense to me.  Whatisit that “America” hopes to “bring to pass” in the world?  And whatisit that “comes to pass” in the heart of a nation that was then about 161 million people?  In what sense does a country of that size even have a heart?  Yet here is a president who no one ever considered as “woke” even by the standards of the time, who competently led a coalition of armed forces in World War II, and who carried out the deportation of large numbers of illegal Mexican migrants, uttering a complete non sequitur.  The most sense that I can make out of Ike’s statement is that he was somehow referring to civil rights, although theBrown v. Board of Educationdecision was still a year off.  If America shows the world that it can successfully manage its black population, well then, even the communists will have to admit that America has a great system.  Or maybe Ike was referring to economic prosperity?  In any event, here’s a competent military leader and politician looking rather foolish in articulating America’ s role in the world.  And it hasn’t gotten better since 1953.

                True, and this Baptist from Kansas was also still fighting for Abolition.
Unable to sleep, waking up at nights in a cold sweat from his wartime decisions, he had to find some way to make his life right with his Lord. His only recourse was to see himself as having been a missionary for the greater good, laying the path for the Messiah’s restoration.
Sorry, Ike. Wrong Messiah…and he arrived in 1948.You most certainly did do your part to enable his coming.

        &gt;In fairness, these debates about the nature of American nationalism were not at the center of the dispute, but they played a role in shaping how the new intellectual class would define American identity after the war. Those arguing in favor of the war being a new founding are not entirely wrong.
After every major war, the entire structure of the country had to be reimagined to justify the side we took. It’s similar to human psychology that once a person is propagandized into taking an action, he changes his values to justify it.

            Exactly, it’s trauma conditioning. Once having been made complicit in gross crime, the only way to deal with the pain is to make it a part of one’s made-up identity.
This is the root value formation we learned from a culture whose twisted sense of identity begins with a gross crime against nature. Publicly hang all who practice or advocate for bris and fgm, and the physically-anchored psychosis would stop, simple as.
(Desmet’s “mass psychosis formation” stops short of the mark, as its fanboys all subscribe to the Great Hoax. That’s like saying trans surgery is ‘just an idea.’)

        Another thing, which I get from Martin Gurri’sRevolt of the Public,is that the Age of Gutenberg in which our Founders lived gave way to the Age of Mass Media. And now the Age of Mass Media is giving way to what we might call the Age of Inter-network.In the Age of Mass Mediia only One Voice from on high got to set the rules. Now with the internet and blogs and Substacks and podcasts we are working out the future in a network of to and fro.And the Ruling Class of the Age of Mass Media don’t like it.

        Speaking of identity, some good news: Trump held a press conference today, and the first half of it was about the border as our most serious and pressing problem. He even stated that, that he could talk about inflation or the economy, but our biggest problem is this criminal abuse of the border. I’m watching the vid at Sundance’s, very somber and serious without the razzle-dazzle.

        An example of this which does not require a discussion of the Civil War is manifest destiny, itself an extension of the Monroe Doctrine. In fact the Civil War was essentially a continuation of both. Destiny, baby!I do think after decade after decade of pointless wars that the public is retreating inward. So much blood and treasure for nothing. At this point, the only thing holding the nation building empire coalition together…is a social issue: abortion. Its proponents profess fealty to the Empire as long as the abortions don’t get touched. It’s also not an accident that the country has grown increasingly imperial in concert with women’s suffrage.  The government is also heavily invested in keeping stocks high – bribery of the wealthy top 10% who are the intellectual weapons capable of fomenting and financing revolution.The politically realignment happening in real time – RFK, Gabbard, Trump, MAGA? Cheney, Romney, Harris? – emphasizes this much-needed withdrawal from the world. America is a self-sustaining ecosystem. With minor exceptions we have all the energy, raw materials, farmland, human capital, and technology we need.Major political realignments almost always result in political upheavals.

        I’m not against the concept of America having predominant power in the world. Not if the country were run by his rightful owners. Living in a world where more and more Brown countries get nuclear weapons is dangerous and I don’t mind using American power to prevent that. And having the high seas free of piracy as well as a host of other things makes an American empire useful. Of course, the problem is the people running America right now are nuts.

            Benevolent dictators rarely stay that way too long. Btw, many of those brown countries wouldn’t feel the need for nukes if we or the Israelis didn’t threaten them so much. As to sea lanes, I’m pretty sure a few Russian, Indian, Japanese, European and Chinese ships could get the job done.
The only useful thing that the US offered the world was the dollar/treasury financial system, and we’re royally screwed that up.

                The question is could the Russians, indians, Japanese and Chinese work together to do something like that? It looks like it was always an empire that kept the seas clear in the past but maybe there were exceptions? Before us it was the British empire. And if you go back long ago it was the Roman empire. But maybe arrangements can be worked out.But let’s be honest, Africa and most of Latin America have a horrible track record of managing themselves. That’s why colonial white rule was so good for them. The problem I see is that someone’s going to have to be in the lead, and there’s no other country that could do it.

                    You seem to be a perfect example of the mentality mentioned in Z’s post. Why do you feel some need to “help” the world by telling other peoples how to act and how to run their societies?
Let them be. So what if they run their countries terribly? It’s not our country. Who cares. Look after your own.
Btw, Somali pirates aren’t too tough to deal with. Russia knows how to deal with such types. You don’t need an empire to keep the sea lanes open.

                        Oh I don’t mean that it’s some obligation of white people to help brown people by ruling over them. I’m just noting that they actually were better off. This is to dispel any mythology about the so-called evils of colonialism.But in theory if we were a non-silly country being run by its rightful heirs, I would have no problem getting access to the natural resources of Africa or the Middle East or South America. And that would probably require some administration on our part. Heck, I might even enjoy vacation spots being built all over the world in places that we ran. A good question would be were there advantages to the British empire in the 19th century to ruling non-white areas. I’m not sure whether it was a net gain at the time or not.

                    What happens in Africa and Latin America is nobody’s business but that of Africans and Latin Americans. And if trading with them is too hazardous because they can’t keep pirates in check, we trade with others and/or become more autarchical.

                            What kills me is the outright scam of low-cost bulk ocean shipping. Much of our food, for instance, is sent to some Third World country to be “processed”- that is, adulterated- and then sent to another spithole to be further processed and packaged, and then sent back. Same in spades with manufactured goods.
We have overlapping redundancy in waste oil-fueled shipping and tax code sleights; what we need is robust redundancy in local production.

            “And having the high seas free of piracy as well as a host of other things makes an American empire useful.”
The constitution of 1787 explicitly gave Congress the power to deal with piracy in international waters and attacks on American shipping… but not to be the Leviathan/GAE/ZOG/M-I-C with military bases in 100 countries to “free the world” or spread “democracy” or “defend Israel” LOL.

            AINO is or was capable of being 90%+ self sufficient with little or no need for foreign trade, and most of that with Canada and Mexico. Thus piracy and freedom of the seas could and should be other people’s problems and not ours. But different choices were made some decades ago about what the nature and form of our economy would be. So that rich people could get richer.

                ”Need” must be defined better.  Prior to WWII we imported rubber for American use.  However, when the Jap’s shut it off, we used home made substitutes.  Nonetheless, Malaysian rubber was a pretty good thing.  No reason to not continue to trade them for it in peacetime.  As long as our trade is “fair”—that is to say mutually beneficial—we both are the better for it.Then there’s aluminum and steel.  Of these two essential, strategic, products, we import 1/3 of our steel and 60% of our aluminum.  Is that reasonable given national security issues?  Possibly, as our biggest seller is Canada.The issue is not as simple as, if we can make it, we should regardless…but given our present exposure, you are definitely on to something here.  BTW: this was something that Trump took notice of his first days in office.

            As to nuclear weapons, they wouldn’t have them if we hadn’t given away or, more often, let them in to steal the blueprints.  That’s what AQ Khan did, working in a Dutch nuclear facility, where he took them back to Pakistan under the watchful eye of a Muslim heading the IAEA.Most subscribe to the Rosenberg couple as spies.  I read a claim that an American general delivered the Manhatten Project blueprints to Stalin 4 months after we had dropped the Bomb; somebody, it seems, wanted a rather useful (to them) Cold War.Oddly, we’ve given away White tech willy-nilly.  Oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, or the Panama Canal.  Satellite and missile tech to China, along with their thousand-and-one copycat plants built right next to the American ones.
