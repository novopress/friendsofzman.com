        Definitely, Bill Jones. Lies, damn lies, and statistics. Blacks commit 30% of all reported rapes in the country. Incest is very high among blacks, and it is my experience around black women which is telling me that. Add to that step-father and momma’s boyfriend rape–extremely common–and statutory rape (huge.) Since the 25 yo male and 15 yo girl coupling represents the most common ghetto pregnancy it is simply ignored by the criminal justice system, and certainly never prosecuted. No one can compare statistics that do not exist.Perhaps they are counting john’s getting arrested in prostitution stings. That would work in favor of the white count. And kiddie porn, etc. Also, I expect that the white pederast may have everybody beat, so there’s that. At best it is a  misleading stat.

        “For instance, whites commit far more sex crime than blacks. ”
No, you cannot say that.
There is the possibility (probability?) that sex crimes by whites are more commonly reported than those by blacks.

        “poor” families are typically because of one of two possible reasons:   1. divorced/seperated/never married thus headed by a single parent.  2. Two parents neither one smart or capable enough to rise out of poverty.Thus it would seem more likely to me that these two causes are why children commit more crime and “poverty” is just one of the symptoms and not the cause.

        Btw, I haven’t before read MR. But I do read Zerohedge, which has been a valuable resource for many things, when it is not complete rubbish. I can live with that. But I don’t know of a site which is so unhinged from consistency. Oh, yes, Libertarians.
Sorry I missed your process of banning. It must have been beautiful. Maybe you could put up a sidebar of sites from which you have been banned.

        It’s also a bit like blonde jokes. We pile all the old ethnic jokes into blonde because it is assumed everyone wants to be blonde or own one, so no harm no foul.

        Gosh, no consideration of negative reinforcement, except by “the State” of course, “suddenly” (in the history time line) becoming “punishable by law”?
