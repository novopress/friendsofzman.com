        I really donâ€™t understand why we care what happens to Ukraine. It is the duty of every small country with a much larger neighbor to do everything it can to not give the larger neighbor a reason to gobble it up. Ukraine had 24 years to make a go of it and it failed. Ukraine should make a deal where it hands over eastern Ukraine in exchange for a ton of cash and natural gas.
