        Europe with its multiple parties and coalitions is much more fertile ground for dissidents. They can start new parties and slowly gain seats and get their message out.Our two-party system makes our job dramatically more difficult. We basically have to overthrow the GOP establishment with the ((TPTB)) fighting us the entire way. For now, the better way to slip inside the walls of the GOP isn‚Äôt pushing for ethnic nationalism ‚Äì which is a bridge much too far for your typical GOP voter ‚Äì but to push for civil rights for whites.We need to get whites to start thinking as whites, to recognize themselves as an ethnic group. We‚Äôve been conditioned to ‚Äúnot see color‚Äù so the first step on our long journey is for whites to see their race. Just talking about whites as just another group is jarring to whites who have been trained to never, ever think in racial terms. Make that normal, not by pushing for white separation but by pushing for fairness.Pushing for civil rights for whites plays right into the narrative of our time. I mean, who doesn‚Äôt love, love, love civil rights. We only want fairness. No group should be discriminated against, including whites. (Again, this makes whites just another group and not a pariah.)Sure, CivNat gatekeepers will argue that we shouldn‚Äôt play the identity game (unless you‚Äôre a Jew), but our answer is that until the Dems give up identity politics, we have to protect the groups that they are attacking.Yes, it‚Äôs a play on the Dems are the real racists nonsense of CivNats, but we use that to increase racial awareness of whites. Once we‚Äôre accepted as another group, we can organize like other groups, celebrate our past like other groups and think of a homeland like other groups.Civil Rights for Whites!

                I want to push on all fronts. Infiltrate the GOP. Start forming small groups of DR. Weaken the current power structure as you create an alternative.
CivNats are doomed, but we can push that along and be ready when they faill.

                    Consolidating Our Guys at the local level serves this purpose, Citizen.  And it‚Äôs not just a GOP thing.  If we can co-opt the local Dems, do that as well.Our first goal is counties where Our Guys have local institutional support, particularly in law enforcement and the courts.  In itself that‚Äôs a project for multiple generations ‚Äì finding the jurisdictions that are already ‚Äúalmost there‚Äù and moving the needle toward Our Thing as many notches as necessary.To leverage electoral politics to our advantage, we need to be the guys in the smoky backrooms selecting the candidates for sheriff, judge and mayor instead of the guys passively voting for the Kosher Special.

                        Take a lesson from the ‚ÄúKosher Special,‚Äù team. If ‚Äúyour guy,‚Äù isn‚Äôt on both sides of the ticket, you have made a profound mistake. Politics exists to settle contention. Your issues should not be in contention. They should be cast as moral universals or understood as a priori necessities.

                    Dude the GOP is doomed thanks to demographics. Besides our side lacks the talent, money and drive needed to pull it off. Besides that we‚Äôre out of time.We have 5 years at most to get our act together before the Left and Big Tech drops the hammer on us.  Once FL and TX go purple it‚Äôs the end for whitey.Pay attention to what the Demonscats are saying ‚Äì they want us dead and gone. If they get into power they will destroy the U.S. in short order.Go read the House Bill ‚ÄúThe Way Forward Act‚Äù If that ever gets passed the U.S. and whities go extinct.

This is becoming less true in metro and suburban areas (e.g. outside the Imperial Capital) where the influx of non-whites has turned whites into minorities.

                I‚Äôm in the Imperial Capital and it‚Äôs happening here, at least with the young. I keep telling people that it‚Äôs the Asians and South Asians that are catalyst. Whites feel guilt toward blacks and Jews (the Holocaust indoctrination is deep) but they don‚Äôt feel guilt toward Asians and Indians.
When they start spouting off at whites, something changes in white people‚Äôs faces ‚Äì even liberal whites. They don‚Äôt like it. What‚Äôs more they realize that these other groups are exempting them from their screed. That dot head doesn‚Äôt distinguish between good and bad whites. We are only white.

                    That whole guilt thing is something that needs to be addressed.  Northerners especially ‚Äì should feel no guilt about black slavery in this country.  When I run into people who start making arguments about the ‚Äúblack experience‚Äù in this country ‚Äì I typically remind them that something like 350,000 NORTHERN men DIED to ‚Äúdefeat slavery‚Äù.    When you compare that number against say US WW2 deaths ‚Äì and factor in population levels ‚Äì the deaths rate during the Civil War was massive.  When you factor in the succeeding generations not born ‚Äì because of those deaths ‚Äì that is also a cost borne by whites.So tell me then black guilt apologist ‚Äì how much is enough?  If the deaths aren‚Äôt enough ‚Äì then what is?  How long exactly do we have to pay?The whole Jew holocaustianity thing can be argued using similar methods.  American soldiers DIED to defeat Nazi Germany.  So tell me ‚Äì how much more death is required to set it right?   Should I sacrifice my son?  Should we build a time machine and send back a few million DRAFTED men ‚Äì and set history right?Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not Catholic ‚Äì but I have NO guilt whatsoever over either black slavery ‚Äì or the Holocaust.  I know my family history ‚Äì and I know my own history ‚Äì and I have NOTHING to answer for on either account.  So when people bring that shit up ‚Äì I usually rip right into them ‚Äì because they‚Äôre typically doing it as some sort of attack against white people in general (which includes me) ‚Äì or in a few cases as direct personal attack.The best defense against all that ‚Äúguilt‚Äù crap ‚Äì is a good offense.  I‚Äôve never run into a case yet where it hasn‚Äôt shut them up.  Sometimes they leave pissed off ‚Äì but they do leave.

                            Well yes ‚Äì the Southrons have a bigger issue than us Northerners. The fact that your fight has been maligned as ‚Äúdefending slavery‚Äù ‚Äì makes your task a lot harder.  I understand the reality of that war is that the vast majority of Southern men didn‚Äôt own slaves ‚Äì and fought the war to defend their homelands ‚Äì but the propaganda says otherwise.
Honestly ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know what to tell you.  But I also don‚Äôt see why I should abandon my argument just because it doesn‚Äôt work for somebody else.

                    Indeed Citizen. The lefts anti-white racism reflex will work to our advantage.In particular, helping to turn white women war brides away from the leftist occupying force and back toward their men and culture.All this Beck-Karen stuff we see even in the ‚Äòmainstream‚Äô media is a dose of reality to the goodwhite progs and churchladies alike. White is white bitches. They are coming for you. And your precious one-and-done kid.My sister has lived in VA and now in PA. Her two kids are in suburban public schools. The dots and the other invade/invite clans are feeling quite swolle by the combo of codified anti-white hate and cover for running their own race/cultural clannish favoritism.The nice white ladies are discovering that not all POCs are the same. The low IQ native ones have been relatively easy to avoid, contain, and or placate with gibs. This has changed very quickly in some areas.The tipping point of more diversity has hit home. And the new ‚Äúminorities‚Äù have learned to game the system quite well.They aren‚Äôt ashamed of scooping up all the low hanging fruit of the prostrating whites. To them, favoring ones own people is quite normal.They have high paying jobs in gov‚Äôt, defense, tech, pharma, etc. they take an active role in local politic, schools.Her kids get white peepo bad all day at school. Then get excluded or conditionally included in the social arena because they are not of the right clan/color.They are not quite a minority yet but in terms of cultural and political power they are already displaced. This is all in the backyard of the nation‚Äôs founding.She gets virtue signaling goodwhite moms in the neighborhood that get spun up about diversity and white privilege but then when the inevitable happens there is nowhere left for them to retreat.The district white moms demanded moar diversity. Got it. Now demand something must be done about all the violence, bullying, and cratering test scores.All that still isn‚Äôt enough to turn them away from the cult. Because orange man bad. Or systemic racism. Or other leftist voodoo.But like my sister ‚Äì who is now woke AF, there is a point when the Becky-Karen-Chad hits home and all their goodwhite fiat bucks go up the tandoori spout.

                        I‚Äôve been saying for years that middle and upper-middle class white women are next on the hit list. They‚Äôve been insulated, but those walls are coming. They can‚Äôt get their brains around what they see on TV ‚Äì which panders to them ‚Äì and what they are starting to see on the ground.
One of my kids was talking about ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù memes. I told her, ‚ÄúYou know, that‚Äôs directed at white women specifically. They‚Äôre talking about your mother, and some day, you.‚Äù That surprised her. Welcome to the club, kid.

Maybe it‚Äôs time to abandon MGTOW and re-engage. Hold your nose, take that spoonful of castor oil and get yourself a white girlfriend. Deal with her drama. CQC in the war of the sexes. That would be the place to start.

                                        That‚Äôs very true but it can‚Äôt be hoped for. Also divorce law has favored women forever so it‚Äôs not the root of the problem, even if a huge barrier.
Somebody had to storm the beach at Normandy. And I say that as someone who‚Äôs taken his lumps and continues to. Guys who‚Äôve been through an ugly divorce, sure, retire.
Beyond that I think conditions are much more favorable than they were a decade ago. Women are starting to question feminism. Not a majority but not an insignificant number either. It‚Äôs as good a time as we‚Äôll get.

                It‚Äôs happening here in flyover country at big corporations. The MIS guys I work with know the score and will say very directly that the white guy who got fired for a screw up got fired because he is white &amp; that an Indian would never have been shown the door for the same error.Had a friend introduce a white guy to my analytics team leader; we chatted afterword &amp; he mentioned that, of course the white guy couldn‚Äôt be hired for analytics now because analytics only hires Indians (2/17th of my group being heritage Americans).It‚Äôs tough to tell if this amounts to a decision positively to help our guys out because nobody is stupid enough to say such a thing. But irritation with the sub-continentals is real, and it‚Äôs especially real because American companies have reached so far down the talent scale that the new ones are very often nothing special. The more that happens, the more it becomes clear that lower wages is the only thing driving all this. Taking away the, ‚ÄúWe just want the most talented people,‚Äù fig leaf opens a lot of eyes.

            If any state were to do away with single district, first past the post elections and move to a European-style proportional representation system, that would be huge for us.
All it would take would be one state to do this for their legislative elections and the others would follow suit.

            I‚Äôve been arguing for disassembling the two party system for decades now.  It was pretty apparent to me from looking at European politics ‚Äì that any sort of non-standard left , or non-standard right wing views would have a better chance of succeeding if the Democrat/Republican duopoly was broken.Who argued the loudest FOR retaining it?  All the normie cuck conservatives that I ran across ‚Äì that‚Äôs who. They‚Äôd scream ‚Äù we have a two party system!!‚Äù .  Providing them with the quotes from guys who founded the country ‚Äì who spoke against ANY political parties ‚Äì and showing them the evidence that the corporate political parties have a stranglehold on the mechanisms of government ‚Äì all to enrich themselves and hold power ‚Äì all had no effect.So I decided to just sit and wait.  Because I could see what was coming somewhere down the road ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  breakup.And it‚Äôs here.  We might even get it this year.  The two leading candidates in the Democrat primaries ‚Äì are communists.  Sanders comes right out and admits it ‚Äì Buttgag is very circumspect about it, but his father was and he admits he admires his father, so he is too ‚Äì he‚Äôs just a better liar.  The Democrat power structure already screwed Sanders once ‚Äì and the Sanderites think now that they‚Äôre watching closely that it won‚Äôt happen again.  It‚Äôs going to anyway.  After that the party probably splits.The thing is:  the laws that the two parties have put in place have very carefully excluded any substantial influence getting into the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù by third (or fourth) parties.  So once the Dems split ‚Äì whatever spins out of that are going to run headlong into the rules and laws put in place by the party they just spun out of to keep the two party system in power.That‚Äôs where we start to see opportunities open up.  Once the parties start breaking apart ‚Äì the laws and regs are going to have to follow.  The damn commies are always screaming about ‚Äúpopular representation!‚Äù ‚Äì I say let them go for it.  Maybe we can get all those 3rd/4th/5th party exclusions out of the legal structure.  If we‚Äôre really lucky we can get back to popular election of senators (make the commies start screaming for it) ‚Äì then we can open up the restriction in the House keeping it to 435 seats.Direct election of Senators, House restriction to 435 seats,  income tax, elimination of the militia in favor of the National Guard, central bank, abuse of the commerce clause, Dept of Education ‚Ä¶.. etc.  All of these things were setup as control structures to keep the power structure in place ‚Äì and that power structure evolved into globohomo and POC worship.Knock out all of the control structures ‚Äì and it becomes a white man‚Äôs world again.  If the commies are willing to knock over the pillars ‚Äì then let the roof fall on them.

His father wasn‚Äôt just a casual communist, he was a professor dedicated to the studies of Antonio Gramsci. In other words, he was hardcore.Unfortunately, probably 95% of the electorate has no idea who you mean when you mention Gramsci.

                    Yep. I positively look forward to people using the phrase white privilege since it gives me the excuse to say, ‚ÄúWhat about Asian privilege since they do better? Or for that matter, what about Jewish privilege?‚Äù
It‚Äôs like shooting fish in a barrel. You show the other person to be an idiot and anti-white, and you get other whites in the room to realize that people hate them for no real reason other than they‚Äôre white.

            Preach Citizen! The big stick lies upon the ground, begging to be picked up. It will be difficult for the Left to attack a call for fully including whites in Civil Rights protections for the same reason the left has a hard time responding to the IOKTBE flyers. There is no way to oppose IOKTBW or Civil Rights for All without appearing racist. The greater difficulty will be struggling with the establishment right, classic liberals and the civnats. Prager, shapiro, et al will rage that whitey must not bite from the forbiden apple of ID politics- they just want whats best for the gentiles. They will carry many along, particularly the old who have worn the ruts too deep to slip onto a new path. The answer to them is that we only ask for the same protections against racism that almost everyone agrees are fair to be extended to whites. You dont want to protect racism, do you?

            Besides civil rights for whites our side can capitalize on the jihad against masculinity. Men of all races are getting sick of that which is why these woke feminist anti male movies have been bombing.
I can foresee over time the Republicans becoming the male and married white woman party and the Democrats becoming the female party. The Republicans would also become the white party but that would not be its branding. Getting red pilled about women starts opening men‚Äôs eyes to a lot more about the game the tribe is playing.

        The current Zio-frenzy of aggression and paranoia definitely has a ‚Äúdarkest before the dawn‚Äù feel to it.Our enemies are not as united as we often see them superficially.  There are deep disagreements in the factions of the Tribe and their shabbos carpetbaggers about how and how fast to replace and subjugate us.  Should they go low and slow toward the inevitable finish, keeping it quiet like the old mob bosses who told Gotti to say out of Time Magazine?  Or should they bust out now, seizing the moment before the troops get restless and start punching rabbis in Brooklyn?Demographics are destiny for the enemy as well.  Browns &amp; Blacks have time preference issues and Asian Wokies figure they‚Äôve waited enough millennia to find their place in the sun.  High-caste, high-functioning Jews are out-marrying at unsustainable rates and the lumpenjuden Hasids and other hillbilly strains of Judaism are their only growth sector.Ironically, they‚Äôre in the same box they‚Äôve designed for White America ‚Äì losing demographic ground in their smart fraction, making up the numbers with lower quality out-groups, facing the inevitable cultural calculus ‚Äì the more Outsiders you enfranchise, the more like them your society becomes.It really couldn‚Äôt end up another way.  It‚Äôs the viral dilemma.  The virus needs a living host to survive but can‚Äôt attack a healthy one.  Constant attention and effort is required to monitor the host‚Äôs health even as you deliberately damage them.A lot of their orcs can‚Äôt handle the nuance of White Man Bad But Need White Man.  Some of the high-caste Tribe and a bigger chunk of the lumps can‚Äôt wait for victory ‚Äì Michelle Goldberg, Bari Weiss, etc‚Ä¶ are already cashing in and doing victory laps before the war is won.Our task is first to survive ‚Äì buy the time we need to let time work its necromancies on the Other Side.The final irony is that their task becomes exponentially harder the closer they get to White minority status (aka ‚Äúvictory.‚Äù)  More Whites Notice their situation as White faces become less common in their daily lives and the culture-war rhetoric slouches toward 11.The Jewish Way of War, bottlenecking soft-power choke-points in the host culture to offset lack of numbers and hard power, has baked-in downsides.  They need to win quietly and/or quickly.The louder and longer we can make this fight, the more the odds shift in our favor.  We‚Äôre still a majority, they‚Äôre still 2%.  Our troops are White, theirs aren‚Äôt.

            Charlottesville was a symptom, not a cause. The Euros would have known to avoid that trap. The thing is, the European Right has been facing Antifa type stuff for a lot longer than America. The reason they are ahead of is is simply that they have been facing the far Left for a lot longer. Up until the 1990‚Äôs, the establishment Left made sure to keep the far Left under control, so we are just getting to experience how these people play politcs.

                True.  The emergence of Pepe as a political force shocked me, and yes the alt right naively allowed themselves to be subverted. But the nerve they touched runs wide and deep. John Smith is right about the red pill tsunami. It can only be suppressed for so long.

                        The rally had a couple of major red flags.  They walked right into it. It was a PR disaster that set back right wing causes to this day.  Made a lot of people timid. Even forced Trump to double down on CivNat. Textbook subversion.
Alt right could‚Äôve been a vent. Now we‚Äôre sitting on a volcano.

If we hadn‚Äôt tried then our critics would instead be deriding us as keyboard warriors, although I don‚Äôt mean to include Painter among those critics.
Since you keep saying ‚Äúsubversion,‚Äù be more specific.

                                Whites being sold out in their own country is a legitimate concern. That turns into a tiki torch march via subversion.  How why or who I don‚Äôt know because I didn‚Äôt get involved in the alt right.
The optics of that alone were so delegitimizing the march should‚Äôve been dropped. It was practically chumming for antifa and chaos.

                Unfortunately, I think that one has to view these sorts of milestone events in the most idiotic, retarded, primary-colors ways imaginable.For instance, Charlottesville for all its weirdness and its complexities, resolves into two dopey factoids:1.  A bunch of stupid cavemen marched around in an idiotic torchlight parade, which reminded historically illiterate and easily-scared people of ZOMG!!!!11!!!   The Nazis are coming!!!2.  A guy who slightly nudged a morbidly obese woman with his car in the midst of a violent and confusing traffic jam, was sentenced to like 700 million years in double-secret evil prison, Because Reasons.  Now THAT‚ÄôLL better send you a message, cracker-goy.  Don‚Äôt get ANY ideas.

            Charlottesville was a learning experience, albeit a painful one. Again, compare it with Richmond to see that at least the Right has learned the lesson. Even the DR3 virtue signaling was good political cover.
I draw the line at Hazony, though. He is a snake, and the Right has been sold this rug before. The silver lining is that his ‚Äúselective ‚Äú nationalism provides an excellent opportunity to expose the Ziocon con to Normie.

        ‚Ä¶trying to sum up the gatekeeping process succinctly for normie.Ben Shapiro and fellow travelers try to give conservative leaning people who know something is wrong and are looking for answers just enough so that they stop looking for more, but not enough that they awaken and start organizing in their collective self defense.  Shapiro wants us to point at the young people in Antifa as the enemy instead of the globalists who are in possession of the control nodes of Western Civilization and using them to rape us to death.The young in Antifa are a symptom, not a cause, and many have gotten there through a similar process where left-leaning young people who know something is wrong and are looking for answers have their antipathy directed away from globalism and towards those listening to Ben Shapiro. It‚Äôs the current-year version of ‚Äúlet‚Äôs you and him fight.‚ÄùI‚Äôm not saying that Antifa and fellow travelers aren‚Äôt dangerous, just recognizing that they are a secondary infection. We only have communism and socialism problems because we had a cheap-labor-over-all would-be-planetary-aristocracy globalism problem FIRST. The pneumonia of Antifa can kill us, but we are never going to be rid of it until we cure ourselves of the AIDS of globalism.

        European nationalists wave Israeli flags to avoid being called Nazis and this works about as well boomer cucks playing DR3.  I don‚Äôt think Hazony provides any more ‚Äúcover‚Äù than a base black at CPAC.It would be better to burn the flags and end this game of pretending that there is somehow a wall between Jews in Israel and Jews outside of Israel.Worrying about the relationship of this or that Jew to our thing is a waste of time.  Better to make all nationalist and even fake nationalist groups inhospitable to them and politely show them the door.Thus Paul Gottfried should be removed as President of the Mencken Club.  How or why a sandwich-maker ended up on top of anything having to do with H.L. Menken is beyond me.  Has he provided cover for all those good men whose time has passed, like Derbyshire and Brimelow?  I don‚Äôt see it.If we cannot do something as simple and obscure as putting a based white man on top of a supposedly rightwing forum named after another based white man, what is the point of getting everyone to run away to Montana?

                Re:  ‚Äúfocus on getting people to notice‚ÄùHere is what I would say to people want to broach those topics:I live in the north ‚Äì my ancestors didn‚Äôt own slaves , but died nonetheless in the northern armies that defeated the south and thus freed the slaves.  My dead ancestors ‚Äì and most importantly their progeny that never existed because of those deaths ‚Äì are a price my family already paid.  Please explain how I am personally responsible in the here and now ‚Äì seeing as how my family already paid a high price.  I think that debt has already been paid ‚Äì I will tell you flat out that I REFUSE to pay any more.  What are you going to do about that?I live in the US.  My family tree goes back at least 200 years.  It‚Äôs mostly Anglo-Saxon.  But yet I have family members who fought and died in WW2 ‚Äì or suffered the consequences of combat for the rest of their lives.  The country I live in has been substantially molded and manipulated to serve the country of Israel ‚Äì as well as Jewish residents of the United States ‚Äì for my entire life.  So please explain to me how the outright death of family members,  the decades long mental and physical effects of combat during WW2, as well the continual picking of my pocket has not paid any form of fictional ‚Äúdebt‚Äù that I personally may have incurred against worldwide Jewry?  What EXACT debt is owed?  Please explain.Because I feel absolutely NO guilt ‚Äì and quite frankly am sick and tired of being told I have guilt.  Despite decades of research and deep personal inquiry ‚Äì  I can find no reasonable measure under which I have incurred ANY guilt ‚Äì nor should ‚Äúfeel‚Äù any guilt.  Again ‚Äì repeated for emphasis ‚Äì please explain.Put them on the spot.EXPLAIN TO ME HOW I AM GUILTY.

Pretty much, yeah.  But I do like the idea of dissidents punctuating our take on things with the question, ‚ÄúWhat are you going to do about that?‚Äù  Asked calmly, with a hint of a smile, will probably cause massive apoplexy.  They‚Äôd rather not admit they want to put you in chains, but that‚Äôs the sort of question that forces their hand.  Make the choices plain to all and sundry.

                        If you‚Äôre dealing in an internet argument ‚Äì then yes , I agree with you.  Asking somebody to ‚Äúexplain‚Äù ‚Äì leads you nowhere.  It‚Äôs different though when you‚Äôre face to face with somebody ‚Äì and they can sense your underlying rage at the assertion of guilt ‚Äì and  you just keep saying ‚ÄúExplain‚Äù.   When they diddle and fiddle and can‚Äôt come up with a good reason ‚Äì and  you just keep pushing the ‚Äúexplain‚Äù tactic ‚Äì they will often fold.It‚Äôs why I bring up the numbers of dead.  When  you start using the argument that your ancestors literally died trying to right the problem that they claim you‚Äôre guilty of ‚Äì they‚Äôre forced to come up with a retort to that assertion ‚Äì right then and there.  And it‚Äôs hard to come up with something that tops paying with your life.What I‚Äôve found is that most people simply can‚Äôt think on their feet during an argument.  They don‚Äôt have the background knowledge to back up their argument , or they don‚Äôt have the temperment to think shit out while they‚Äôre under verbal attack and their assertions are being questioned by somebody who is obviously pissed off .Which is why I tend to agree with the people who assert that one of the reasons why there is so much spreading censorship online ‚Äì is because the lefties are too often losing their arguments.  The thing with face to face confrontations though ‚Äì is that there‚Äôs usually no way to shut them down unless somebody calls the cops.  And even triggered white soy boys don‚Äôt tend to call the cops just because they lost an argument.A few years back I got into it with a POC after he smashed into me at a stop light.  I was sitting 2 or 3 cars back at a light ‚Äì and when the thing turned green he just accelerated into the back of my car.  I almost instantly let out a WTF ‚Äì which he obviously heard because my windows were open.  I knew exactly what he did ‚Äì he wasn‚Äôt watching in front of him ‚Äì he was watching the light  instead of watching whether the car directly in front of him had moved.So we get out of our cars ‚Äì and the first words out of his mouth are ‚Äù I didn‚Äôt hit you‚Äù.  So now I‚Äôm really pissed because I‚Äôve been thru this too many times over the years and know exactly where it‚Äôs going.  I just looked at him and said ‚Äúlook I know exactly what you did ‚Äì you weren‚Äôt watching the phucking road in front of you ‚Äì you were watching the light ‚Äì because you hit me as soon as the light turned green ‚Äì so cut that shit out right now‚Äù.His next tactic was to start denying that he did any damage to my car.  I responded first with ‚Äù that‚Äôs for the insurance adjuster to decide‚Äù.  And he next pointed to a rusty spot on the fender and said ‚Äù I didn‚Äôt do that ‚Äì that was already there‚Äù ‚Äì so now I know he‚Äôs stupid because he doesn‚Äôt even know how rust happens on a car body.Then he went down the discrimination route.  He came out and said ‚Äù you‚Äôre only doing this because I‚Äôm black‚Äù.  I just looked right at him and said ‚Äù You even mention that one more phucking time and you‚Äôre going to have a real problem‚Äù.  He just shut right up.  And about 20 seconds later a cop showed up and a fire truck that was passing by stopped and a guy leaned out and asked if there was a problem.  At this point I didn‚Äôt realize the (female) cop was behind me ‚Äì and I blurted out ‚Äúno there‚Äôs no problem here ‚Äì this guy smashed into me and now he‚Äôs trying to claim I‚Äôm pissed off about it because he‚Äôs black ‚Äì and that‚Äôs not the issue ‚Äì the issue is that he‚Äôs stupid and he keeps denying that he did it ‚Äú.The cop then asked what was going on ‚Äì and I gave her a quick rundown ‚Äì including the discrimination claim ‚Äì and when I was done she just looked at the black guy and said ‚ÄúYOU ‚Äì over here  (pointing to the side of the road)‚Äù.At that point I was still pissed ‚Äì and I know she could tell.When it was over , I got his insurance information ‚Äì and I ended up getting $800 out of his insurance company for the minimal damage.  Plus I‚Äôm pretty sure he got dressed down by the cop ‚Äì and I got the satisfaction of calling him on his bullshit.Things like this are why you‚Äôre never going to convince me that ultimately what is going to solve this insanity is direct confrontation.  Given the way things currently are ‚Äì doing it in the public sphere probably isn‚Äôt going to be successful ‚Äì but that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt happen on a one on one basis.

                    I think it is important to point out the blacks had essentially no role in freeing themselves from slavery. That was a fight between white people. The same goes for voting rights, etc. Blacks got whatever rights that white people decided to grant them.

                    I look at it a little differently. You are right that in saying that you have no guilt in that your Northern ancestors didn‚Äôt own slaves and some suffered and died in a war that freed slaves.However, I don‚Äôt think that we should ever have to explain ourselves in this regard. Some of my ancestors owned slaves and/or fought for the Confederacy. Why should I feel any guilt about my ancestors? Do blacks feel shame that their ancestors were slaves? What‚Äôs more dishonorable: being a slave owner or being a slave? We live in a crazy society. People revel in the fact that their ancestors were slaves and didn‚Äôt do a damn thing to free themselves. It‚Äôs the victim mentality. If I were black, I would never bring up slavery. Why are they proud of this? If my mother had been a prostitute, it wouldn‚Äôt be my fault but I sure wouldn‚Äôt ever want it mentioned.

Are you telling me that replacing the head of an organization no one has heard of is moving too fast?
Or are you saying that no one will notice the flag of our greatest ally being burned in public?
Or are you saying people will notice these things, but draw the wrong conclusions from them?

Out of context, the destruction of symbols makes no sense.
As I see it, taking a loosely or ill-defined context and using the spectacular to reframe or redirect it is how this can work.  And few things are more spectacular than fire, or the destruction of a group‚Äôs holy things.
The silent mass-burning of Israeli flags outside of something like the Weinstein trial is the sort of thing I am thinking about.

‚ÄúAs noted in the past, Hazony‚Äôs game here is to rebuild the walls between the good thinkers inside and the very bad thinkers outside. Instead of rebuilding the old wall in place, he plans to extend the perimeter so the new wall will include the more docile nationalists and populists, who are happy to have a platform, but will not threaten the castle of cosmopolitan globalism.‚Äù

        Zman pointed out one of the clearest tells a group like this is a gatekeeping group when reported from the Washington D.C. conference.  They get excited, sometimes to the point of resembling rabid animals when given an opportunity to call a white person on the right a racist.
Steve Sailer asked Hazony on Twitter if he would let Charles Murray speak at a conference devoting half the time to nationalism and half to his new book.  Hazony disingenuously claimed he didn‚Äôt know enough about Murray‚Äôs positions to know if he would.

        I think we will be thinking about gatekeepers and these new wall builders for a while to come. Rusty Reno‚Äôs book and F.H. Buckley‚Äôs book (American Secession) strike me as similar efforts. Reno does a great job diagnosing exactly what is wrong with globohomo and how the magazine he runs has played a big part in it, but then he simply hopes that globohomo, well, eases up a bit, see?Similar thing with F. H. Buckley ‚Äì outlines the logic behind secession (while of course making the point over and again that racism bad, very bad) but then argues that real Federalism or Home Rule or something could be a compromise.Hazony ‚Äì and for that matter, Ahmari ‚Äì strikes me as similar in intent: outline exactly what the problem is and suggest that the people responsible for it, ya know, stop it or something.   These guys are really on globohomo‚Äôs side, having benefitted from the thing greatly for a long time, but are perceptive enough to see the problems. But they are pathetic, really. They are like men who read Aquinas and, having concluded that the elites rule only for themselves and are therefore tyrants, with all that implies, find themselves unable to finish the thought.For them, to complete the thought is to imagine an apocalypse. It‚Äôs come to that.

            It is surely no coincidence Comrades that Hazony appeared when he did.
I‚Äôve always scoffed at conspiracy theories‚Ä¶not this time though. This has been a well organized and financed rollout.

        There is the risk that Hazony et al succeed.His sort co-opted the Tea Party movement and managed to use the energy for their own ends‚Ä¶and then safely ground/dissipate the energy behind the Tea party.  We may gain insight to the thoughts of the ruling class by examining this and other reactions, but they can still call on beau coup cash and support from their sort.While not going hammer &amp; tongs vs Hazony &amp; Co, we do need some bumper-sticker and/or elevator argument responses to civnats &amp; normies inclined our way.  To keep them from falling in with Hazony &amp; the co-opters and to red pill them with the cynicism of the whole Hazony effort.

            The elevator argument is to point out that Hazony is not one of ‚Äúus.‚Äù

        Always play the fairness card:Every racial and other form of group identity has a formal organization defining, organizing and advancing their particular group interests ‚Äì as a racial group. They do so at the national, state and community levels. Every university, every school district, every professional organization, every corporate organization  has a foot in this. A large part of our bureaucracy and of our legal institutions revolve around these racial group interests.There is only one group not permitted to pursue their own group interests formally. In an increasingly multicultural society to be denied these same right in protecting our own interests as a group, the very group who founded, settled and build the foundations of this society is unacceptable.  Stand in the way of this, keep poking the bear‚Ä¶then watch what you will unleash‚Ä¶.____Something or things along this line will appeal to enough people. Play the diversity card by expanding it to include us. CoAsc is spot on about this. Swimming with the current is a lot easier than swimming against it. Once we can get enough people to start thinking of our group interests‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sure many interesting things will begin to happen.

                Too bad ‚Äì it was Gilette-levels of artistry: a bunch of POCs pocsplaining to white Scandinavians that there‚Äôs no such thing as Scandinavian culture, it‚Äôs all been invented elsewhere. The hate was palpable: all the whiteys were  either old, fat, ugly or all three, and imbued with the slow wit and base habits so characteristic of goys.A fat retard Dane attempts: ‚Äúwindmills‚Ä¶?‚ÄùAs if one single person in Denmark believe that windmills were invented in Denmark, but if anyone were in doubt, we have some Asian dude doing the ‚Äútsk, tsk, those silly Danes‚Äù-attitude: no, they were actually invented it Egypt, so there, racist!Same theme all the way through: a native dullard produces some silly thing that he apparently believes is unique to Scandinavian culture: meatballs, parental leave, open-face sandwiches and so forth, and every time you have some smugfaced poc putting the locals in their place.At some point you have a weirdly voiced-over, out-of-style segment where they‚Äôre thanking America for Women‚Äôs Lib. Take that, Britain!Black dude tells us about how ‚Äúour‚Äù Viking ancestors basically stole and copied everything, and how travelling abroad allows you to bring home ideas and culture.I hope someone took a copy, it‚Äôs an absolute masterpiece.

                            If anything they were raided by them.Don‚Äôt believe all that Church propaganda. The Vikings were friendly and nurturing people, spreading peace, love and liberty by launching a series of humanitarian missions to protect the locals from their evil Saxon overlords, and almost succeeding in their venture until tragically thwarted by Alfred the Cruel of Wessex.Untold numbers of refugees were helped across the North Sea to find work in Scandinavia, Russia, Byzantium, and the Abbasid Caliphate, and the Norsemen‚Äôs humanitarian zeal eventually inspired the local potentates to donate large sums of silver to the relief efforts.Three hundred years it took to liberate England, and only in 1066 could the country breathe free again, but the relentless vilification and smearing of these people have cost untold trauma in innocent Vikings.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HVmLOGrB4w#TheVikingsDidNothingWrong#RememberSaintBricesDay

        One wonders how much ‚Äúcover,‚Äù the Hazony faction actually provides. Given the backlash against Rome attendees, the total absence of any payoff, and the low billing of Zionism generally in Europe, the calculation is dubious at best. Of course, the fact that some, perhaps many, of the ‚Äúnationalists,‚Äù in Europe are just Trump-like Zionist tools, with no intention to deliver on much in the way of actual nationalist policy, is a handy explanation for why the likes of Orban would be present. Salvini appeared further from that orbit, but perhaps Bannon arrived in Italy with just enough carrot and/or stick to bring him along.The upshot of it all is significant, but Z misreads the tea leaves. The ‚Äúestablishment,‚Äù is not so concerned. Likudniks are worried that Blue and White is taking charge of the diaspora. Not worried enough to give westerners any help against the Blue and White subversives, but worried enough to trot out these weak half-measures as some kind of pilot hedge program. It amounts to nothing yet, but could.

        Salience is key to any movement.  Plenty of movements have fizzled out because they lack salience.  The Tea Party was exactly like this.  It had all kinds of reactive energy, but could easily be coopted with a few ideas being picked off by the establishment.  The establishment now comes to the dissident movement and attempts to look for anything  it can pick off for its own.  Sort of like penguins building a nest from pebbles stolen from other penguins.   The problem that will vex them is that the dissident movement is less about ideas and more about, as Pat Buchanan says ‚Äúblood and soil.‚Äù  When you want to have a community of other people like you, without seeing a woman in a burka roll down the street, the goal is put before intellectual ideas and concepts.  How do they take on goal oriented people who don‚Äôt sit around intellectually masturbating about ‚ÄúAmerica as an idea?‚Äù   This is why, when they will jettison their professed love for the first amendment in an attempt to smash us to pieces, especially as the movement grows.  Don‚Äôt think they won‚Äôt eventually twist arms of ISPs to block websites.  They already do it with foreign terrorists.  Don‚Äôt think you won‚Äôt need a VPN to see this site in five years.

        The mainstreaming of any kind of nationalism is unlikely, at least as long as the synarchical Cabal is confident it can shame, brainwash and teargas the current turbulence into exhaustion. For nearly five years, many a Lyle Lanley has offered to salvage the globalist project from itself, from Peter Thiel‚Äôs Eric Weinstein to Jordan Peterson, and none has found a receptive ear among TPTB. They all had the shock toons loosed on them, for fear that their proposed adjustments might open up the floodgates of skepticism.Back in early 2017, there was talk that Gavin McInnes‚Äôs ‚Äúwestern chauvinism‚Äù would be legitimized into Political Correctness 2.0, a tactical stepback from the 2010‚Äôs Wokening with none of the uncomfortable reexaminations of Globalism‚Äôs foundational lies.It was not to be. At first, the cynic in me thought they were being given token vilification to burnish their street cred. But it does look like the word went out that their services were not needed, and that they should instead be used for target practice.I see the New Right et al. as the latest in a long and pitiful line of leftist fellow travelers who one day decided that the Crazy Train was getting too close to Loonyville for their liking, and had their railcar parked on a siding, screaming ‚ÄúGo on without me!‚Äù to the main convoy as it trundled into the distance. It is to the Right‚Äôs shame that they instinctively take in the marooned misfits as de facto allies, instead of treating them like the stranded enemies that they are.

            Gavin McInness, despite having, in my opinion genuine and accurate opinions on gender roles, was never about creating a movement other than to market Gavin McInness.  I accept that, and I also accept, that the market was there for someone to exploit in a certain place and time.  He‚Äôs another one that doesn‚Äôt have salience.  He founded a stupidly named group, knowing that Elks clubs were long ago driven into the ground, and when some of its actors were unfairly prosecuted he cut and run, leaving them with nothing but stupid tattoos as mementos of this group.  And what was this group about?  From all I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôd basically, we love gay people.  We love diversity.  We just want women to make us sandwiches every so often.  As a side note, he talks about his liberal wife, and his liberal upper-class neighborhood, and how closed minded they are, yet there he is.

            How do you know that outside the realm of thought and chatter nationalism isn‚Äôt mainstream?  Americans are deeply patriotic, and hardly enthused of globalism.  They rightly see Globalism as a scam.  Most of the world does.  Only those in on the swag love globalism, and that can‚Äôt even be 15% of the population.People vote especially Democratic out of tribal loyalty to dead man gods like FDR.They only just awoke to the truth- and voted for a leader.

                This entire discussion is about elite culture and how it adjusts to the populist challenge. Your point is irrelevant at this juncture.Globalism is the default position in the circles that matter.As to your contention that nationalism is mainstream among dirt people, I challenge the idea that it is anything more than a fringe position at this stage. Americans are so confused they don‚Äôt even know what their nation is anymore. Patriotism, for most, means drinking from a flag-emblazoned mug and going goo-goo-ga-ga every time the military blows something up. None of which has anything to do with the national interest. Call it state fetishism, imperium worship, or civic cargo cultism.

        Hazony was truly the most disappointing thing of the last 4 years. He‚Äôs the only one to put out a treatise on Nationalism and he watered it down to the point of non-existence.
I get I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised, but since I formed my nationalist ideas in the crib of the Old Testament, I thought a Jew would be the only one able to politically defend nationalism. He just couldn‚Äôt avoid the ‚ÄúJews are special‚Äù trope.

        ‚ÄúThe proper strategy for the right wing must be what we can call ‚Äòright-wing populism‚Äô: exciting, dynamic, tough, and confrontational, rousing and inspiring not only the exploited masses, but the often-shell-shocked right-wing intellectual cadre as well. And in this era where the intellectual and media elites are all establishment liberal-conservatives, all in a deep sense one variety or another of social democrat, all bitterly hostile to a genuine Right, we need a dynamic, charismatic leader who has the ability to short-circuit the media elites, and to reach and rouse the masses directly. We need a leadership that can reach the masses and cut through the crippling and distorting hermeneutical fog spread by the media elites.‚Äù ‚Äì Murray RothbardOf course much has changed since the early ‚Äô90s when he wrote the above but if the real right wingers ever hope to gain power we are going to have to offer populism. We are going to have to offer a program that will appeal to Joe Normie and all his buddies.Time to lay out a program.

        If you want to see a similar situation going on on the left, take a look at the CNBC stock whore that the establishment will be running against AOC.  It‚Äôs right out of NBC central casting, corporate Latina from HR chosen to put uppity communist Latina in her place.  This is what they do.  It‚Äôs all focus group.  If AOC was savvy she would make a big issue of it.  A stock pumping whore for corporate America runs against poor little bodega shopping Latina.  This is why Bernie and AOC, and their ‚Äúsquad‚Äù are valuable.  They do way more for dissidents than your run of the mill Democrat or even Republican, carefully masked by handlers.  We get nothing further out of Drumpf.  He‚Äôs used.  Even Bloomberg may end up being a better springboard than orange man.

            AOC only beat Crowley by 4,000 votes in a low turnout primary.  She is a gaffe machine who could easily lose a primary to someone like Michelle Caruso Cabrera with the right messaging.  If enough voters in NY 14 think AOC is making them look foolish and hurting employment opportunities in the district they will boot her.

        Sincerely, the most realistic solution for Europe to regain any relevance at the world stage is to federalize the EU and create its own military, with would be the end of NATO and US military industrial complex, finally giving real freedom to everyone.

            I think that is an appealing concept, until you start thinking about the specifics. The common currency, for example, has proven to be terrible for Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece. It has been a boon for Germany. The limited political integration has been a disaster. I struggle to see how the theory can be implemented without the same pitfalls of the EU project.

                I don‚Äôt know if any of you saw the results of the poll of EU citizens where the question asked was which side would you support in a conflict between the US and China?   There wasn‚Äôt a country where even 25% would support the US.   Most were overwhelmingly neutral.  This leads me to believe (1) Europe should not be garrisoned at the expense of present and future US taxpayers.  (2) Can we just stop throwing our weight around and let them meet their energy needs as they see fit as sovereign nations?

We belong ‚Äúover there‚Äù even LESS than they want us there. And for heaven‚Äôs sake get us the FRACK outta the Middle East, the Sandbox and the Rock Pile. If the Jehadists and hadjis want to blow up mosques and hack one another‚Äôs heads off, I say ‚ÄúLet ‚Äôem!‚Äù. I see nothing outside our borders  worth so much as one (extremely inflated) dollar or a single drop American blood. My Momma raised me not to stick my nose where it wasn‚Äôt wanted.

                As a purely economic ‚Äúconfederacy‚Äù that conducted trade policy in particular as a bloc, the EU might work to leverage Europe‚Äôs economies vs. the US, China et al.  But the economics were just sugar-coating for the practically-minded in terms of selling the EU.The EU was intended first and foremost to destroy and replace ethno-nationalism with a Euro version of civic nationalism because Bad Uncle.But like American civic nationalism, the unifying ideas aren‚Äôt strong enough to withstand political realities.  Englishmen have very divergent interests from the Continentals.  Germany has more compelling reasons for detente with Putler than Spain does.  Norwegians pay their taxes &amp; work hard.  Greeks not so much.Military integration is if anything more demanding than political organization and crosses many of the same lines of ethno-national interests.  I don‚Äôt see how that happens.Without England, the EU looks even more like a German-Frankish boondoggle.  For the remaining nations, even less reason remains to Remain.  When Britain doesn‚Äôt collapse overnight, their example is going to light the way for others.  Only the smallish taker-nations in the EU are vested in it now.  For Europe‚Äôs larger more successful nations, the more you contribute and participate, the less good it does you.

                    Among many forces pushing for the EU was a group of German companies who, late in WWII and knowing it was lost, got together to discuss the 4th Reich.Google (or preferably use a reliable search engine) ‚ÄúRed House Report‚ÄùSott.net has a piece on it, as does Corbett Report.

                    I, for one, would like to see Germany‚Äôs economy after the U.S. has pulled the hell outta NATO and they suddenly have to foot the bill for their own defense. I‚Äôd also like to see what OUR economy looked like without the crushing financial burden of garrisoning the world. Let‚Äôs face it; neither Russia nor China have any real capacity to project force much beyond their own borders. ICBMs aside, they present no threat the American homeland. Hell‚Äôs bells! China presents no threat to Japan even WITHOUT our garrisons on Honshu and Hokkaido. For a nation without a standing army (all Japan has is a ‚ÄúSelf Defense Force‚Äù), IIRC Japan has the 2nd largest armed forces in the far east.Nope. Time for us to pull our troops inside our own borders and let the twin ‚Äúmoats‚Äù of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans protect us. If some nation were stupid enough to invade the U.S.mainland they would discover the very real truth of the disputed quote attributed to IJN Admiral Yamamoto that there would be an American with a rifle ‚Äúbehind every blade of grass‚Äù. The quote may be disputable, the principle it encapsulates is not.

            The only thing I can see working is a European common market confederacy along the lines of the Swiss model. Each nation would be a semi-independent ‚Äúcanton‚Äù with its own currency and a militia that could be called up. This would require a benevolent Germany organizing and providing the discipline to make it fly. And that would be a tall order.

                The phrase ‚Äúbenevolent Germany‚Äù is more‚Äôn a bit credulity straining for me. I see no reason to believe that Germany ‚Äì or any other nation ‚Äì would lean towards benevolence as opposed to self interest. But then I am an admitted cynic.

            That is a little like saying the only way for Latvia or Estonia to remain ‚Äòrelevant on the world stage‚Äô is to remain inside the Soviet Union. The primary problem w the EU is that it is in the hands of globalists and sees itself not as a wall around the European nation states but as a replacement for them.The EU led by a Bismarck or some other sane, shrewd person who doesn‚Äôt happen to think ‚ÄòEurabia‚Äô sounds like a great idea, could be interesting. Unfortunately that has nothing to do with the EU currently oppressing Europe. Getting rid of that EU has to be the first job.
