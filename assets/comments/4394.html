        I lived for two years (Peace Corps) in a country near the bottom of the list. It is a largely peaceful, sparsely populated country. My conclusions were that the problem is —  modern technology is ahead of the culture.Africa actually kind of works within its own terms. Given their native tools and set on the land they have, they can make a decent life of it. There are luxuries of space and beauty that are extremely costly in the First World that are free there.You have to be prepared to die stupidly (mostly motor vehicle accidents), and you have to take pills so that you won’t drop dead within a week (without modern medicine, the average life-span for a white man in Africa is about 18 months).A prime-directive, stay out of Africa rule probably would have been the best course of action. You cannot imagine how they thwart stuff … but they are beautiful and very funny. There are no depressed people in the country I lived in in Africa.And of course they are nothing like African-Americans.

            There’s an African economist who makes this point. Aid from the West has been a disaster for Africans. Health care and food are at the root of the population explosion, which has destroyed the native organizational systems.
The best thing we can do for Africa is leave it alone and stop helping them.

        I don’t care if I evolved out of a horses ass, but  Africa was not the cradle of humanity, but it’s bottleneck. Once Erectus made it out of there a million years ago things began to pop.

            Africa is where it all started so it is endlessly fascinating to those interested in human biology. It’s endlessly uninteresting to people wedded to the Standard Social Science Model. In the view of those people, Africa should not exist.That said, humans did not stop adapting once they started leaving Africa. The evidence says the opposite. I suspect that adaptability or the lack of it is the big dividing line. Populations that remained in Africa had not use for adaptability, while populations roaming the rest of the world had the opposite. It’s why Africans never go native. You move them around and they remain Africans.

                Yes. The point is that Homo Erectus and his 800 cc brain was present from Africa to the Steppes to Indonesia, and for a very long time, while other forms of humans came and went more inconspicuously. The many stops and starts which became Neanderthal, or later, Homo Sapien, did not so much happen in sub-Saharan Africa as bleed into it.My brother did four stays in Cameroon. He said that it is true that they are of low intelligence, but clever. More clever than he. He saw the day to day life, the schoolchildren walking home from school and so on. The common theme was common brutality. He concluded that brutality cultivates cleverness as a survival mechanism, a substitute for intelligence. He had not doubt that his life was in danger because he was not clever. In fact the police (98% corrupt) almost bagged him in an out of the way place–he refused to play the corruption game– but one of the 2% in another part of the country saved his life.He hardly met an individual who was not scheming to get to America. Apparently they did they not know how bad blacks have it here.

        You look at a place like Zimbabwe and see what happens to a country with huge farmlands and natural resources that has kicked the whites out. Even an African I know who implicitly believes in the continent thinks that Mugabe is nuts and Zim is on a fast track to ruin.Same with South Africa, which has huge potential and resources, but the intellectual turds in the west were so quick to hate the whites there and applaud the murderous tribal thinking of the terrorist black organisations there was never a chance of objectivity. When the west started to elevate the black leadership to sainthood any hope of reason was lost. The whites who remain have to live behind high walls and even invent devices like flame throwing cars to stave off carjackings at traffic stop signs.Meanwhile as many Africans as can are fleeing across the Med and putting enormous pressure on a craven and stupid Europe. The Chinese are moving in fast to grab what resources they can but that may not end well for either the black or the yellow.If Africa is the cradle of humanity the ones that fell out of the basket and crawled to a new life elsewhere to start creating civilisation deserve our thanks. But the parents are coming back for their stray brats, or at least coming to live in the house their distant offspring built.Hi honey, momma’s home!
