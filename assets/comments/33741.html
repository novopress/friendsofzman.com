        Trump is trying to make some crucial changes but they will come to naught unless:1. He reverses course and doesn’t import infinity Indian H1Bs, increases by at least 10x deportations and manages to end birthright citizenship. As is, our replacements will simply steal a country with a more sound economy thanks to Trump.2. The Trump administration becomes more than the Trump show and he can pick someone Israel doesn’t like. So far his domestic cabinet is busy fighting anti Semitism and not much else. AG Blondi seems to be auditioning for a host job on Fox with over 40 appearances. RFK Jr has turned anti Semitism into our biggest health crisis.3. They quit playing nice and find a way to play hardball with the judges. Only the Supreme Court is even in the constitution if I remember right.4. All of these DOGE findings are reflected in budgets. That is something none of the GOP outside of Massie want. I don’t think he is arguing over pennies. He sees that the GOP talks tough on government spending but always increase it.

            “As is, our replacements will simply steal a country with a more sound economy thanks to Trump.”
Dunno. I figure they won’t have to import a whole lot more before they will have to open a season on the varmints…

            “RFK Jr has turned anti Semitism into our biggest health crisis.”
Ugh, this. As bad as Trump introducing rat-faced war criminal and veterinarian (overseeing the human sheep) Bourla as a ‘good guy’ the other day.
Let’s see, what is LESS of a ‘health crisis’ than the others:
a) Usury-driven debt serfdomb) Pornography addictionc) Opioid addictiond) Losing your son, father or husband in a war in the Middle Easte) Noticing there might be a common factor among the good people behind a-b-c-d

            Nothing more can be done wrt “birthright” citizenship.  It, as planned, is now in the courts and will eventually work its way to the SCOTUS.  Exactly as planned.

        Thomas Massie is the lone GOP congressman who doesn’t take AIPAC money.  This should at least merit mention on a dissident website!  Trump singling Massie out with such hostility and threatening to work against his re-election should be considered in light of that fact.  Z-Man surely knows this, so I’m unsure why he’s uncritically amplifyng Trump in this instance, and calling Massie playground names like “dickhead.”  I agree with Z-Man that libertarianism is a bad philosophy but that’s a far bigger topic.

            Agreed.  Not only doesn’t Massie take AIPAC money, but he votes against any and every foreign aid bill – to Israel and everyone else.  Because there’s no provision in the magic constitution – nor was there any intent in history – that a people should be taxed to send the money all over the world.  As Davy Crocket wisely noted, “Congress has no power to appropriate . . . money . . . as an act of charity.”  Being a good and honest financial steward has nothing to do with libertarianism.

Nothing to do with any politician, as it turns out. But of those who at least give lip service to being a good and faithful steward, there is a common denominator…

        Trump should have done this stuff in his first term, when there was still some runway left. The fact that rat-faced Chuckie Schumer changed his tune so quickly tells that me as a peasant I can expect to get fucked by this CR.
Even though I agree with what Trump is trying to do in principle, it seems way too late to avoid the iceberg. Let’s just hope that the ideas being pushed don’t get tarred along with Trump when the economy blows up late 25/early 26.

            As I understand it, the CR keeps spending at Biden’s level until they work out the 2026 budget this fall.  That explains why Chuck-You was so quick to turn tale and support it (why wouldn’t he, it’s mostly his doing).  I’m unsure why Trump would want to be saddled with these commitments, especially considering how limited he is with time before midterms.

                Because the alternative is the bill gets passed with changes making it worse, after a week of anti-Trump hysteria. They have one shot to get this right so they have to avoid the usual traps. It could still fail, as dickheads like Massie are not alone in the GOP.

                    Massie is not a dickhead. On principle, he is right about a LOT of things, especially the Israeli stranglehold on Congress.
The problem is that the Jeffersonian-libertarian, small-government, America-First country in which the Constitution actually matters is dead and gone and it isn’t coming back. It’s a global imperial Leviathan $36 trillion in debt.
Massie is useful, if for nothing else, as a Socratic gadfly reminding the citizens of Athens how far they have actually strayed from the principles they claim to believe in.
The fact that there is only one Massie in Congress instead of 300 says a lot.

                        Hard to get much of a hate for a guy who is the only person in Congress willing to give AIPAC the finger. Considering the abject nature of the typical GOP Congressperson, I’ll reserve my hate for them.

                    Why such hate for Massie?  His standing up against AIPAC alone is enough to give him plenty of good will.  I suspect some of Trump’s distaste for him is also from small hat influencers.  The tribe has vowed he will never get the Kentucky Senate nomination to replace Mitch.

                That’s my take on it also. Some of the less retarded Democrats got out their box of crayons and drew big block letters for Chuckie explaining how it is way better for the depths of the recession to be happening in the middle of next year, vs late 2025.

                        I think that is spot on. What he’s selling as tariffs should have been explained as “tools of foreign policy” to force other countries to drop their barriers. Then it makes sense to flip flop on them. If you present them as an unalloyed good, you should not be dropping them just because foreign countries dropped theirs.

            My take:  The economy was tanking late 2019, the west needed to go 0% bound and print again.  The Russians and the Chinese said fuck off, we aren’t going to continue to let you print and dictate to us.  So instead we got covid, but and its a big but, we also got a shit ton of inflation from the printing this time since those two refused to absorb it for us like in 08.  Trump wants to get rates lower, but he needs an excuse, a way to drive people into US debt because they’re so frightened it will seem the only option.  Thus all the rumbling lately of republicans don’t care if they cause a recession.  We shall see, but that is how i’m reading the situation.  If he has to crash stocks back to 20k (which i mean, that is where it ended in 2019, so not a huge loss in his eye) to drop rates back down to the low 2’s, its a good trade off.

                I don’t understand why Trump 2.0 would delay things if they want lower rates. The inflation from last year’s spending bill is now starting to show up in PPI, so if they wait, they will be trying to force the Fed to lower rates into an inflationary environment.
Why wait and waste political capital on a second Trump vs JP showdown? Push for it now if lower rates are desired.

They seem to believe that this will gut SS and medicare medicaid.  I don’t think they’ll touch SS, but i’m all for gutting medicare and medicaid.  They spend almost a trillion annually and only something like 19 or 20% of that is via taxes.

                            Something Denninger always leaves out is the fact that a lot of people will be “left behind” when the government can only spend what they have on medical services.  Yeah, the services would be cheaper, but not *that* cheap.  Now to me that’s just an “is” (we don’t have money for it) but he’s being somewhat dishonest in marketing it as pain-free.

                                I agree, he undersells the amount of pain that would come from the end of CMS, but it’s likely to happen whether chosen or not. It’s not like the system as constituted will be able to absorb the costs of end of life healthcare for millions of Boomers getting there each year for another decade at least.
Hopefully someday there can be a public discussion about what it says about a society when it spends 20% of its economy on sick care, or the way for-profit medicine warps the incentives in treating people, as seen in 2020/21.

                                        Here’re some facts that might help to explain why the Progressives love them some “health care,” and think we all should line up sheep-like, ass-up and mouths open, in their clinics.The word “Health” cannot really be defined.  It is always relative to some ideal, which is never firmly defined.  Even a new born infant isn’t necessarily ‘healthy.’  And even when we imagine we are at our prime in our late teens or twenties, any clever clinician could find something wrong that requires a jab, a prod or a prescription.The latin root of the word “medical,” “med-,” means to measure, not to cure.  Therefore, any medical systems are really calibrated to serve as comptrollers to count receipts, measure patients and control the delivery of services.  “Health,” and curing rarely enter into it.Medical services, once received, cannot be returned.  Unlike a faulty wash machine or a car, you can’t return your titanium hip, or your gall bladder removal for a full refund.Citizens are insulated from the full cost of Medical services because most use ‘third-party’ payers to reduce their out-of-pocket costs.  This provides one more tranche of the economy that can be financialized to death by the usual suspects.Last (someone a lot smarter than me taught me this), besides your wife or husband, your Mother, your children and maybe a friend or lover or two, no one really “cares” about you, least of all a newly minted nurse from Bangladesh or Ottawa.Basically, “Health-Care” is a fraudulent market based on shady metrics, a captive population of customers, and a near-exemption from the usual discernment that characterizes most other purchases of consumer products.No wonder Obama made the Federal capture of this fake and gay industry his signature accomplishment.

What the Democratic commenters can’t see is that without cutting waste there will need to be major cut backs to benefits. Even though depriving seniors of medical care and shelter is a RW and libertarian wet dream, I don’t see Trump going along with it.

                Yea, I’ve been watching that too. Whatever you may think of old Buffett personally, he’s one of the best investors humanity has ever produced, so if he is betting cash in the numbers he is, it’s worth paying attention to.
As you said above, the entire thing has been fake since at least 2008, and that can’t go on forever, he seems to be thinking there will be a fire sale soon.

                    Agree, that odd old man, insider that likely knows where all the bodies are buried … is one to watch.None of my holdings are in equities.Hey, when I saw what the government to the north did to the truckers, anyone that donated .. I promptly yanked six figures OUT of TD (Toronto Dominion), had others in my family pull every cent out of TD, Canada related investments and banking. Total divestment of all things Canada.Our tiny, tiny group of people un-Canada’d almost a cool million. A drop in the massive sea? Yes. But let’s try a million people doing the same, eh.Using my Canadian vernacular there.I know our ‘stock market’ is a total sham and tomorrow millions could wake up and find their precious 401k is worth half of the day before. Yes, cash is being eaten away by the termites however at least in high yield savings, almost 4%, spread for FDIC insurance, I am hedged against the criminals that currently have their hands in the cookie jar.Plus, who needs to live thinking about their money EVERY FUCKING DAY? Who ‘enjoys’ that lifestyle?

                        The “Biden” admin directed Castreau to freeze the accounts, and it was done with US technical assistance. What I’m saying is, getting out of Canadian banks probably isn’t much of a defense.

                            Hmm. Well, considering that, at the time TD had a direct hand, in real time, in freezing funds without recourse, I am all ears for you to suggest a better course of action at that time.Action also had a better effect on me and mine in terms of, say, compared to inaction.Say the difference between Doom Pill:“We’re all doomed, do nothing.”To Red:“Make sure to turn all the lights off when you leave the room, the skels from the electric company are going to raise rates through the roof.”To Blue:“Those truckers deserved what came to them.”

            I’m not as worried about that. Go ahead and pass the CR, and have DOGE audit the spending. Anyone who is defrauding the system, while knowing that he will get caught, deserves whatever he gets. Which, hopefully, is something like being fed live to feral swine.

        I don’t think the tariffs will apply to software. It is astonishing how quickly huge numbers of software jobs are in places everywhere  but America. You can go day-to-day and see entire listings move to Hyderabad or Sofia. Uber seems to be entirely an off-shore development shop now.I am not sure how they will make foreign labor expensive in the software industry – one of the few that provides upper middle class jobs.My hope in the bigger picture is that the government’s radical downsizing will provide the labor needed for all of the jobs that Americans didn’t have to do because they were paid to deconstruct our country and our civilization. I also hope that the student loan racket that has seen our universities colonized by aliens in the student body and the faculty also get shut down. I don’t think the tech oligarchs are keen on that one. Finally, I want to see the build a massive castle of young, chad white men who are enlisted to deport the 50 million people that the regime now admits are in our country illegally.I am sure we are all sick and tired of America just leaving everyone on their own in a mad scramble and opening us up for foreign predation. It is worse. Everyone but Americans (whites) are dealt subsidies, sinecures, projects, programs … …The other castle they better build is a viable direct skill to work pipeline that prioritizes the Historic American Nation. All these companies now have that big flag in the factory and say Made In America, but they better start investing in making their labor pool here in America out of existing Americans. There are plenty of us to do the work. The system is running out of time to bring Americans back into the fold and lend a helping hand. The Age of The Smothering Mother + The Age Of The Hand Tying Decapitating Oligarchs has been devastating. The Age of The Vengeful Son is upon us all if they do not do something for someone besides themselves.America the free-for-all office park and shopping mall has radicalized its own people because of its disgusting and severe abuses. One way or the other, it has to end.

As a GenX software guy I’m absolutely furious about the Indian invasion and all the fags and purple-hair-and-tats wymmyn they’ve been hiring instead of us. On top of that my neighborhood in a “techie” area has turned from mostly White to about 80% Pajeet over the last few years. Usually the first language I hear spoken when I go out on the street is not English or even Spanish. I could rant about the terrible code these guys write or their incomprehensible dialect but you all know. Fuck this place.

Your wonderful vision took my breath away.  It would provide many jobs and a sense of nationhood and belonging.
Imagine granting young white men the permission to put their strength and smarts towards reclaiming our country.  And providing them with respectable middle class jobs.

                It would be a re-founding event. New statues for new heroes. A cross generational castle forged by the crucible of service. It would be a monumental moment on the timeline: Mayflower; Jamestown; Philadelphia, New York, Charleston, Boston … establishment; French-Indian Wars; Revolutionary War; … Frontier Settlement; … American Reconquista.In New York there is the Worth Monument that these days every wild from the wilds of Africa lounges around as they await the next electric scooter delivery to some alien occupied penthouse. That monument commemerates the day the last redcoat was sent packing and left Our shores. The men who were essential in our military founding and sending them home are named and honored.We would erect a new monument. If Trump were smart, he would forget about being the next in a long line of guys trying to goose GDP. He would go down with Washington and Jackson and Polk as monumental American titans. He would lead the reconquista and be an Augustinian level leader.Let’s see.

        Spectacular. I am probably going to have to listen to this one twice.Some points of order, though: Canada is one of America’s largest trading partners. Trust me – if we “went away” – you guys in America would notice the same way any business would if they lost one of their major key clients. You Yanks would undoubtedly fare much better than we would… but if we go back to the Dirty 30’s, a LOT of you Yanks will go with us. The same danger confronts yourselves and Europe as well.The problem is that unlike Trump – most people are not business people. Trump doesn’t want to impoverish Canada. He wants a trade partner. Business partners thrive when they team up, care about each other’s welfare and act as a team rather than rivals. They play to each other’s strengths and cover for their weaknesses. This is how adult parnterships work and succeed.Canada’s (and Europe’s and Mexico’s) union slobs, welfare slobs, socialists and communists don’t understand this or reject it outright. To them, economics, culture, life itself – is a zero sum game. If somebody wins, somebody else HAS to lose… and by God, THEY will NOT be the losers!!! This mindset fosters selfishness, contempt and adversarial relationships in everything they do. They typically never run successful businesses, and most of them can’t even hold their own personal relationships and families together. Many Yanks don’t realize that a large minority of Canadians hate America and have a severe inferiority complex when it comes to our relations. That is why our clowns are all huffing and puffing and bragging about reading Trump the riot act and end up looking foolish when they try to intimidate him. Fat Doug Ford from Morontario is probably in Trump’s office getting strapped as we speak!  🙂The world IS changing. To thrive in it, we are both going to have to forge some kind of working partnerships that benefit both of us. THAT is what Trump wants. Unfortunately in the west, he has no one to talk to or deal with. Justin Trudeau is an entitled, arrogant  sparkled socked fairy and a product of the Cloud People. The menopausal cat ladies and girl bosses of Europe don’t need no man and they are strong and powerful and independent enough to go it alone. One would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh at Macrone and Starmer as they threatened to take on Russia by themselves. They are headed toward the trash can of history… and the only way around that is that if the sanity starting to break out in the USA  – spreads.I personally don’t think it’s going to happen. The people here in Canada, and those  involved abroad are too stupid, to arrogant, and too lazy to pick up the life line that America has.But whadda I know?

        I heard the Admin didn’t want the extra sideshow of a shutdown and all the hysterical theatrics that would ensue. Too bad, as every shutdown results in people realizing most of the government is a big Jobs Program. (Maybe he could have kept the parks going somehow, just to make the medicine go down better.). And, bring on the theatrics, as it only reminds people why they voted for Trump to begin with.

                They had the kooks on their heels but the kooks are regrouping and counterattacking. The Democrats have a lot more judges to undermine Trump. Most Republicans don’t want major changes they just want to pretend they are Maga so it is business as usual with the budgets. Time will tell if Trump administration can successfully counterattack the counterattack.

                My understanding is that Massie was opposed because he regards a CR as nothing but a bait-and-switch. Vote for this CR now and next year we’ll implement all these cuts recommended by DOGE. Based on history, he believes there will be no such cuts. In any case, it’s hard to regard CRs as anything but the crappiest form of legislation, bundling everything together to avoid making tough, unpopular decisions about specific programs.

                    I think that is fair, to a point. Clearly, Trump is not the typical Republicans doing the old switcheroo. Maybe that is how it plays out, but Massie needs to give Trump the chance. Instead, he decided to be a grandstanding dickhead.

        The current survey, that came out today, is that we have 53 million foreign born people in the USA which is an increase of 8.3 million since 2020. That is almost as many people as live in Virginia.Needless to say, we can’t have a functioning America First economy under any set of policies until the vast majority of these people are gone. Luckily for anyone who does want to get rid of these people, the vast majority of them have no loyalty to the USA and just see it as an economic zone and looting source like a World of Warcraft dungeon. I don’t even think most of them like it here and they certainly don’t like us. Make it so they can’t make huge amounts of money (relatively) and they will go home.

        I agree that Trumps grand plan is necessary but we are starting to see the whores in Congress are working behind the scenes to dilute, modify and block the really transformative stuff. Trump will hit a wall by summer where the impact of EOs dissipates and he switches to fighting the swamp for every inch of progress. The GOP of course will stab Trump in the back like last time. Im thinking the best Trump can do is to crash the stock and real estate markets then withhold the inevitable trillions in bailouts.

        Rough week. Full of stepping on rakes, as Zman put it.He can probably work the kinks out of 2 booboos (Massie and the 1A case at Columbia).But the 3rd booboo has the potential to do him in if he buys that stinking war and makes it his own. The Europeans (esp UK) are doing their damndest to rope him in. Don’t do it Donald!The European blob wants nothing more than saving their own useless eater seats at the trough, just as our blob does here, and they’ve joined forces. Also, taking Trump down is of utmost urgency to discourage all the nascent populist movements/ leaders arising from the trashheap of failed professional managerialism.In other words, Trump is actually fighting for his life (and family) and he absolutely must prevail with ending this war. It’s his one chance to deliver a significant body blow to both both Blobdoms.Realistically, he only has this first term to accomplish everything. You can be sure the impeachment papers for year 3 are already being hatched.

            The WH made this clear with the GOP caucus of both houses. They had a meeting two weeks ago in which they told them they needed time to put together a budget based on what DOGE has done and then cuts being made to staff and programs. They actually said they needed 100 days. Massie was in that meeting, so he knows the plan, but he chose to be a douche anyway.

                Massie probably has the highest IQ in Congress (which isn’t saying much), but he also seems to be autistically focused on his own inner paradigms, and likes being right rather than getting things done. Naturally he doesn’t play well with others.
He should get out of Congress and run for governor of Kentucky. More personal impact, and a better platform to run for President.
God, I would love to see a primary debate between him and Vance. We all might actually learn something.

                    The problem with Massie (and all libertarians) is the same one, ironically, that you have with the extreme Marxist Left in Europe. Their “program” is so far out in the Oort Cloud that they have no practical agenda to negotiate for. This turns them into tools of the mainstream Left and Right which benefits them because they can sell their tiny amount of power to the highest bidder of the moment.This is why the libertarians have turned to mostly voting with Democrats. They saw that the wind was blowing that way due to demographics and White wymyn becoming (even more) extreme Left than they were before Roe v. Wade got nuked. So now they’re, effectively, far Left Democrats while supposedly disagreeing with almost the entire agenda of the Democrats. It’s a way to virtue signal to a Right or libertarian leaning voter base and stay in office while being complete traitors to everything they “stand for” when it comes time to vote on things. Perhaps Ron and Rand Paul actually believe in all that Ayn Rand crap. The rest are probably just flyover country grifters. If they lived in San Franshitsco or Port-a-Potty Oregon they’d be all about climate change and sea level rise while flying everywhere in a private jet and having 2 beach houses.

        Trump is attempting to do more than reorganize the US economy, he’s trying to remake the global trade and finance system. What I can’t figure out is how he’s going to deal with the dollar.People argue that the global trade system is out of balance because the US runs a huge trade deficit, but that’s not true. Our chief export is the dollar. It’s a commodity, indeed, a desperately needed commodity used for trade, debt servicing and collateral. If the US reduces its trade deficit, it will reduce its export of dollars, which will cause all kinds of trouble, not least of which is the dollar will skyrocket relative to other currencies, which will completely counter-act the tariffs.Trump and his Treasury Secretary Bessent seem to be cooking up some type of Plaza Accord or Bretton Woods to deal with this problem. That would be huge.

            “Trump and his Treasury Secretary Bessent seem to be cooking up some type of Plaza Accord or Bretton Woods to deal with this problem. That would be huge.”Perhaps, but relations with the Europeans do not seem as congenial as they were back in the 80’s.  Plus you need to be able to trade actual products, which both blocks had a lot of back then, not so much now.  Trading pieces of paper back in forth lacks the same weight.  The Europeans need to be brought to heel if you are going to try and replay the cold war with the brics.

The way I framed it is the great powers will come together like a chancery court, with the US as the chief justice and controller of the global currency. Together, the great powers will manage the global economy, but individually they will have their own area of control, like a district court judge.

                Agree. This idea of de-dollarization is off the mark. There’s no alternative nor does China want the job of being a reserve currency, even a regional one, as that would require running deficits like the US. No thanks.But I’m still confused as to how the US can reduce its trade deficit without squeezing the dollar higher – too high for the system to handle. The demand for dollars isn’t going to change anytime soon so a reduction in dollars exported would starve the Eurodollar system.How do you maintain or reduce the price of something when the supply gets cut in half while the demand remains the same?

                    Maybe there are too many spinning plates here for my brain to handle but I have three questions:1) why should the demand remain the same if Trump/Bessent are looking to reorder the global economic system and are willing to weather a global recession to do it? and2) since dollars are also created offshore, wouldn’t large international financial players pick up some of the slack? and3) in relation to question 1, in the longer term as part of their  reordering of global trade and finance, does there have to be one reserve currency? IOW, does Trump/Bessent really care about preserving the U.S. dollar as the sole reserve currency? They may be thinking if the U.S. dollar survives, well and good, exorbitant privilege and all that, but if there’s a chance it doesn’t, what’s going to take its place? There are no good alternatives in the short to medium term for a global replacement. Alternatives may develop for regional blocs however. Maybe they’re saying that would be acceptable.

        The outsourcing of production and the insourcing of cheap labor was a bonanza for the economic elite and they know it. Some of them have seen that the system is unsustainable and support Trump but most have not, as evidenced by the large advantage Harris had in campaign contributions from billionaires. Wall Street reflects the interests of the billionaire class and had the vapors as soon as Trump announced his tariff policy. It is a threat to their gravy train and they will go out to defeat Trump’s attempts to return production to the USA and deport the cheap laborers. Their money has a powerful influence on both parties in Congress, so Trump must be resolute to succeed.

        Paul Craig Roberts points out that tariffs are a tax on consumption rather than a tax on labor or capital, which is sound policy from an economic point of view. Conventional economists are too tied to the “free trade” ideology to recognize this. Trump’s political success will be tied to the success of his economic policy, which is always the main motivation for voters. Trump’s critics on the right have pointed out that part of the reason for his 2020 loss (besides the fraud) was that his economic policy did not deliver enough benefit to the working class to motivate them to support him as strongly as they did in 2016.

            Problem is imports are not all that much — $400 bn or so. Even the 25% tariff that Trump proposed, levied on fricken everything, would only pull in $100 bn. So what’s that, 9 days of spending?
If you want to tax consumption, tax consumption. Tell the states they have to start collecting a 5% sales tax and forward it on to the Feds, in exchange for elimination of Federal Income Tax for the residents of that state. That would pull in about $1 tn, about what income tax pulls in.

                That is a bit disingenuous zman.  He is much less a “doomer” then quite a few others you might read.  The math says collapse, but faith can keep you running in mid air for quite some time ;).  In fact i’d argue we are already collapsing, its just a very long and slow process.  Karl was 100% correct about covid too by the way.

                    The problem with Karl is he never understood how the global financial system works. He still thinks in terms of money printing and hard money. The appetite for government debt is seemingly limitless because treasuries are the global store of value. They are a proxy for present and future business. As a result, we have options that no other country has.Think of it this way. Imagine the United States has access to an unlimited mine of gold. We can mine not only what we need, but what the world needs as much as we like. That is what the dollar is at the moment. It is why the number one priority for Trump is protecting the dollar. That is the real point of making a deal with Russia. It is about protecting the dollar.

Then why QE and force rates to 0%?  I think its because it isn’t limitless.  When you have to do things like that, its because the market will not accept the rates you want.

                            Think of the dollar as a commodity on par in importance to oil. Oil is the backbone to everything in the modern world. Well, the dollar is the backbone to global financial and trade system. Without the dollar – or even enough dollars – that system grinds to a halt.But unlike oil, which is produced by many countries, the dollar has one source, the US. Everyone thinks that we run a trade deficit, but we don’t. We export dollars and treasuries (which are a store of dollars), which the world desperately needs.In fact, you can tell that we aren’t producing enough dollars from the fact that the dollar has substantially strengthened, i.e., gone up against other currencies, since Covid. Yep, all that money printing and new debt wasn’t enough to satisfy the global demand for dollars and treasuries.You can’t look at our money printing and debt against the US economy. You have to look at it against the global economy and global demand for dollars.

I think they’ve been planning and working since then or longer on how to get out from under that yoke.  The world works how you state, but my question is, for how much longer?

                                    Actually, Americans – at least some Americans – suffer from the dollar being the GFC just as much as the rest of the world. We have to run trade deficit with manufacturing economies which means that our manufacturing sector is much smaller than it should be, which hurt blue collar workers.The problem for Russia, China, India, etc., is that there is no alternative to the dollar. What’s more, the Eurodollar system is a voluntary system. We don’t force the countless private businesses and banks to trade and lend in dollars. They do it because it’s what’s best for them.The US didn’t create the Eurodollar system. It grew organically, again because it was what worked best. Putin can talk all he wants about moving away from the dollar, but neither he nor anyone else has proposed an alternative.Saying that businesses will trade in their own currencies doesn’t make sense. They could have done that at any point in the past 50 years. They choose not to. The US isn’t forcing anyone to use the dollar – outside of oil. Even there, big deal, China buys oil from Saudi Arabia for yuan. What do you think the Saudis do with the yuan? They trade it for dollars.Now, the world may be trying to move away from treasuries as the global reserve currency, replacing it with gold, but that’s a long way off and just a partial measure anyway.Anytime you hear someone talk about de-dollarization, don’t listen unless they tell you what will replace the dollar and then evaluate whether that alternative seems realistic.

You can give 2 people the same pay, and one will have Rent-to-own furniture and be forever poor, the other will live below his means, and eventually have nice furniture which he owns in a house in which he has some equity.

It would seem that other countries, quarantining, restricting, and shutting down their businesses had as much or more a recession as did we. Their currencies were made shaky as well.

                                I also think that if they’d let the market do what it wanted in 08 rates would have done the exact opposite.  They said it was a liquidity crisis.  If banks want to attract liquidity then they’d have to offer higher rates, but that would have tanked the stock market even more.  So they had to QE and 0%. banks get free liquidity and the stock market booms, rewarding lemmings.

                        It seems like rebuilding domestic manufacturing and protecting the dollar are rather contradictory goals though. A strong dollar makes our own products more expensive relative to foreign equivalents. I get that that is the purpose of the tariffs but can they really be high enough to truly level the field?It’s difficult to see how any nation can produce the global reserve currency without ending up the US – a kind of consumerist, phony service economy where we all sell real estate to each other for a living.What would be ideal is a global economy where a sort of trans-national, explicitly a-political organization met regularly to support a reserve currency independent of any particular nation. Is such a thing even possible? Well, as long as people like the Kagans and the Euro girlbosses are running around loose this is probably utopian.

                            “A strong dollar makes our own products more expensive relative to foreign equivalents.”Although he said so in his columns, in his academic publishing not even Krugman believes that. Protecting the pound is where Soros made his billions. There is a very short term effect, true, but arbitrage is now being done within milliseconds. It takes no longer than that for HFTs to wipe out the differences in currencies.Heck, someone, Ken Griffin, maybe, front-ran the Chicago Mercantile by installing a receiver on top of a nearer building, and even though the data was broadcast at the speed of light, the shorter distance than his competitors was enough to make a killing.

                                It takes no longer than that for HFTs to wipe out the differences in currenciesI tend to like your posts Steve but In this case, I think HFT is a red herring. As I understand HFT arbitrage, it takes advantage of very small fluctuations in relative values, essentially statistical noise, and uses some small advantage in timing to make money like the example you gave. I’ve actually looked at software jobs in that field. They all emphasize being very good at writing tight C++ or now, Rust, code to get that edge.The thing I was talking about has to do with longer time scales. I don’t think the basic logic is flawed. If the dollar is the reserve currency, everyone will need them, thus the dollar will be strong, on time scales of weeks or greater, than some other random currency. That means that if I live in Shitholistan and am one of the lucky people who have both electricity and running water and want a washing machine from the US, I first need to convert my Shitshekels into dollars at a rather unfavorable rate**. It doesn’t really matter to my purchasing decision if the exchange rate varies by 0.01% on millisecond time scales.As for Krugman, I don’t pay much attention to him but I do know that when some Lefty on some dumbass site like Daily Kos wants to argue some point that contradicts every know law of supply and demand, he will cite Krugman followed by an ad hominem about how “he’s a Nobel Prize winner!”. Well, so is Obama.The story I heard about Soros is that he made his money bettingagainstthe Pound but I really don’t know much about him other than that his dad Satan helps him out a lot and that he bought a bunch of district attorneys during the Coof chaos as an half-assed coup attempt.** I understand that the conversion probably happens above the consumer level at the importer butsomeonestill needs to do it.

                                    Yes, Soros naked shorted the pound, just as he did the Thai baht later to bring down the Asian tigers. (I spoke to the son of the Cambodian minister of finance by sheer chance.)
Perhaps by “protecting”, Steve meant Soros made it more affordable, or more available for whales to gobble up?
Soros, like Hillary, is almost certainly an Intelligence Community front or middleman.  That’s why he and she have immunity despite their numerous crimes.

                                        Fair, @Pozy. We are talking at least a couple of distinct ideas here.The main reason the US PTB don’t care about remittances is that when Juan sends dollars to Juan, Sr., those dollars go into a coffee can under the floorboards for a rainy day. Since his pesos or reals or whatever are going to be worth less tomorrow, Gresham’s Law says he spends his native currency first and hoards his dollars. Until Juan, Sr., decides his mujer needs a washing machine, those dollars are essentially an interest free loan to the US. So the US’ interest is in keeping the dollar inflating slower than any other option.I’m using HFT is a more general sense. Because the UK was committed to keeping the pound “strong”, Soros was able to play the spread — shorting the pound. Had they not been committed to that, and instead accepted reality for what it was, there would have been no actionable spread. HFTs have made the Efficient-Market Hypothesis a real thing — they minimize spreads by thousands of trades right at the margins of both ask and bid, moving them towards one another. As such, with the software now running at thousands of investment houses, the spread Soros played is no longer possible.Keeping the currency “strong” gains an advantage WRT the former, but is exploitable by the latter.

                                            Well ok, I hadn’t given any thought to the effect of remittances on the economy but, like the HFTs, I think it’s not likely to be a significant counter to the overall macro picture – dollars as reserve currency means dollars in high global demand and thus dollar denominated goods and services become uncompetitive with goods you can buy with Yuan, Pesos, etc…I hope that Trump’s tariffs and threats of tariffs will at least bring the Europeans, Canadians, and others to the table to negotiate lowering their own (usually crippling) tariffs against us. I think that’s what Trump-the-businessman is hoping to do here. If other nations lower their tariffs, that should allow US goods to become at leastrelativelycheaper even if the dollar remains the global reserve currency.

                        That means the dollar itself is an emergent system, on its own already a global financial reset.
As Citizen says above, the Eurodollar is its own exported commodity, and if this were commonly understood by the institutions (or at least the economists), perhaps our policies would (rationally) change to reflect this.
