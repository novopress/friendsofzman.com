        “Two Tier Kier”, the British Joe Stalin wannabe, is arresting Brits for Facebook posts, while ignoring immigrant crime, and the Bobbies seem quite happy with their role as the KGB wannabes…Britain is DOA…

            The main enemy of the Brits right now is the police. Make their lives miserable enough that they stop showing up when migrant centers get burned down,  and then move up to to terrorizing the petty regime lackeys.They will “change” their opinion overnight on immigration when they feel a quarter of the pain they inflicted on their subjects.

                Any of these movements must make peace with the idea of violence against the agents of the state. Paul Revere and his gang did precisely this – for example, in the middle of the night, they’d surround the home of a tax collector while dressed in white, with their night caps pulled down over their faces.
The term for that is terrorism.

                        The biggest problem with this now is of course smart phones/social media. If this were the late ‘90’s and all of this crap was going on, using Michael Collins’ strategy would be your weapon of choice. Now, forget it. The only way any of that will work is if there is a massive power outage coupled with cell phone jammers.That is in an urban area, suburban and semi-rural would be different, as always, YMMV.

                    The Irish had American and MENA supporters that equipped them with weapons on par with the British forces arrayed against them.
The British people have none of that support and are unlikely to find it. The world does not think highly of them.
And they live inside the Five Eyes panopticon. It appears that like the commonwealth the Brits are going to be crushed by their betters and the foreigners who control the island and they will acquiesce back into serfdom. Learn from their sad example.

                        The question is whether long-term and sustained disruptions can be maintained. My guess is they can be even with the panopticon. We and it will see. If that proves out and it starts to damage Those Who Matter economically, I’m not as blackpilled. There is little doubt the British government, which is indistinguishable from the Soviet one at this point, will crack down hard and make matters worse. I think Gdansk is a better analogy than Belfast.

                            The government with NGO assistance will import more workers by incentivizing more foreigners, including Europeans and indians, to migrate and replace native Britons. Standards will be reduced to subsistence if believed necessary. Impoverishment of natives is a feature and not a bug. Your average Brit will be atomized and erased. It does not look good for them throwing off their yoke.

                                The Regime does appear to be stepping up the importation, to your point, but resistance is expanding rapidly, too. We need to learn from this, of course, because numerically we are in a far worse place although we also have numerous advantages otherwise.

                        It doesn’t seem far fetched for them to get Russian or Chinese support, but that is more dangerous in terms of a regime crackdown than American support was. Two Tier Keir would love nothing better than to paint them as Russian agents.

                            The Russians and Chinese will benefit if Britain further declines. They welcome the self-destruction. There is not a single non-commonwealth country that wants the British to sustain other than Americans. Much of the world actively wants the British to disappear.

                “And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand?… The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin’s thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt! If…if…We didn’t love freedom enough. And even more – we had no awareness of the real situation…. We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward.”―Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn ,The Gulag Archipelago 1918–1956

That is the key (and why the regime is so intent on cracking down on social media posters).  The Russians at least had an excuse.

                    Yes, that was fantasy writing by Mr. Solzhenitsyn. That’s not how society works ever. Even the most chaotic societies have someone governing. Riots to exert pressure. But it’s mostly just chaos.As the Z man stated, we need leaders from inside the Cloud People. Ground up revolutions are the mostly the wishful thinking.

                If the construction guys are afraid (or too patriotic) to work on the migrant centers, then what about the maintenance and supply lads for certain institutional buildings?
Expect the admin toffs to empty their own wastecans and vacuum the floor? Or service the printer?Ha. Not likely. What then about the legal firms that do their grunt work?Gosh would I like to Micheal Collins the data cable, electrical, and comms techs. Even the plumbers.One building, one firm, one agency silo at a time.

                    Alzaebo – That would be one way to do it.  But people will continue to quote Solzhenitsyn – and continue to do nothing.  The constant and unrelenting surveillance makes anyresistance a certain jail/camp/death sentence.  And people – even still – have too much to lose.  That can and will change, for some.  For many others, the loss of their spouses and children to non-White predations have still produced nothing but utter acquiescence.

                        They will continue to quote Solzhenitsyn because it sounds appealing, like a movie. they will continue to do nothing because nothing helps more than his “solution”.  I respect the guy, I really do. But we know that he exists because the worst of the Soviet system was when he was young man. Quite simply the USSR was losing control by the 1950’s and ultimately no Russian had to fire a shot.

                The biggest hurdle to clear for any real right wing reactionary movement is the overwhelming amount of conservatives who still “back the blue” and see the police as allies. Even though there are many that are conservative, they continue to arrest and suppress their own side. You hear the excuses of “they are just following orders” or “they’re just trying to do their time to get their pension.” Since when is this a valid moral excuse?During the Irish war of independence, Michael Collins made members of the RIC one of his primary targets. He saw them as traitors that were aiding and abetting the enemy. Just saying.

                            I always liked Malkin; she was always pro heritage America, anti affirmative action, and anti-imvasion.  After this Denver event she was red-pilled and then aligned herself with some “far right” figures and seems to have retired now.
She surely has awoken to the fact that her years as a NormieCon who supported the likes of Bush and civnattery was all in vain.

                    The bigger issue is that law and order matter, even during times of political choas. I’m not about back the blue, but I fail to see how declaring war on the police fixes anything either. They are getting their orders from above, because that’s how society works and always does. We need leaders, not randomness.

                        Declaring war on the police gets them off our backs and gives us greater freedom of movement. The fear of arrest and prosecution (persecution), as much as anything, is what stays our hands. If we make it too painful for the cops to harrass us, they might just leave us alone and chase after nuggras instead.

                            No, that’s not how the military/cops work. Resist the cops and they send more cops, who treat people more harshly. We Americans are drinking a little much of our kool-aid, which is largely from Jewish fantasies about revolution.And if you don’t believe me, go look up how the Whiskey Rebellion turned out. It’s as an American rebellion as it gets.We can resist by channeling a “grit in the gears” sort of energy. But dreams of civil unrest are just movie fantasies.

                                Civil unrest, from our people, is happening in the UK right now. It is a fantasy to claim civil unrest is fantasy.
And cops are mere men–and increasingly women. As such, they can be and often are defeated by shows of force. Let’s not make these flat-footed dullards out to be Roman Legions under Scipio Africanus.

                Every single rotten thing currently occurring in the Western World is because of White men in law enforcement, the military and the intelligence services. They are the ones protecting the status quo and allowing it to flourish. Men with the Cop mentality are the most psychologically screwed up people on the planet. Mindless guard dogs with no morals.

                Several years ago some fellows from south africa toured (sud landers, as i recall)  america giving presentations to various groups that would likely be simpathetic to the plight of white south africans. Various Irish representing the IRA had done this as well in the past.Many of us donated to the Sud lander cause at the time.During early WW2 many firearms were collected &amp; donated so the home guard of england would be able to resist the nazi hoards expected to invade at any time.  Todaytreasonous government &amp; islamic hordes.I would think there might be people here in the US that might be willing to assist our english cousins in possibly a similar fashion. Many areas in the world are awash with the tools of resistance. There are still serious people out there.

        Katie Hopkins, commenting on the riots, said that the biggest trade right now is in trafficking human flesh.  Each pound of flesh moved provides income to centers of power: religions, politicals, ngo’s, charities.   Subsidiary industries such as housing, feeding, benefits, transport, and supply also depend on this trade.
We are reaching the final stage of Tikkun Olam, the Perfected World as envisioned by the world’s oldest slave traders.  Odd how the century of central banking was also the century of democracy and world war and now, human trafficking.

            Hopkins made a diagram that pointed very specifically to three groups that ruled above the politicians, as controllers: religious groups, political groups and NGO’s.
She carefully put those three very close to the top of the paper so people wouldn’t think “hmmm, I wonder what’s above those…”

Being “persecuted” is part of the script. Commie Robinstein went to prison, you don’t mistake him for one of us.

            Think you mean Pajeet. But, yeah, Labour candidates were careful to wear union jack pins and festoon their party offices in similar fashion. Also, their leader looks British, although he tries so hard to be Jewish. Conservatives (like Republicans in the U.S.) keep running non-British candidates in hopes the idiot electorate will forget they’re the white people’s party. I mean, it worked so well for the Scottish National Party, didn’t it?

        The elite in the west are going to keep on trucking on immigration. The entire purpose is to humiliate and displace the political power of their founding stock populations.Now that it has reached that tipping point, and the white founding stock can now tangibly “feel it,”there will be mass bloodshed.It’s reached the point of no return.Best we can hope for is that the good guys come out on top.They ruling class will have to genocide millions of whites to win.

        “Managerial Polyarchy refers to the fact that large complex society does not have central control. Instead it has nodes that control specific domains, like banking, the media, the academy, and so on.”-That’s a fancy way of saying that there is a ruling class.The great problem of the Right is that it is resistant to thinking in terms of class, because such thinking is associated with Marxism. The other issue is that class is not all about money, although the ruling class certainly has more access to it than the ruled class. But the fact remains that our politics is all class conflict. You are either a member of the ruling class, or you are not. And membership in that class requires certain ideological commitments, and often requires living in a specific geographic location.You can be a multimillionaire in west Virginia or Texas but if you are for Trump and for the Second Amendment, you are not a member of the ruling class.You can be a lesbian sociology professor at NYU making $100k and you are a member of the ruling class.In a lot of ways it is very Soviet. You are either a member of the party and the nomenklatura, or you are not.

            Yes, but the real problem is the NYU professor goes along fervently while the only benefit she receives is psychological. She gets none of the bribes, inside deals and armed security.  She and large percentage of the population are such cheap dates, it costs the regime nothing to keep them in line.

                Yes. But the psychological rewards are accompanied by affluence. Not insane riches but ample. It falls apart when they are no longer able to work as a digital nomad and benefit from wage arbitrage or life in the Africanizing city means living in conditions far closer to the colonizers than what was once the norm of the overclass. That is coming. The issue is, is it too late and is there something else they can be offered.I suspect formalized new age communes and psychedelics will be what is on offer. Will it suffice if the commune is subject to rape and murder because the bused in replacements are there? Will it be too late anyway?On a lighter note, Our people are waking up in larger numbers now. This includes more from the striver class. They went for the throat in 2020. They only needed to let the frog boil for ten more boring but unsettling years.Do not give up the faith and do not give up the fight. It is only just beginning and our people are waking up. We will forge bonds and get through this together.

            This is a good observation but I wouldn’t call the rulers a “class.” Sociologically, a class has always been a large swathe of society, something measured in percentages rather than basic raw numbers. What we have is a ruling stratum, whose size is probably less than a million souls (if they had souls). This is a good thing, BTW. Much easier to eliminate a stratum than a class.

            Well, it’s not just that there’s a ruling class. Modern managerialism sets up a complex network of mutually reinforcing sub-classes. Together they all buttress the system. Picture a cathedral with its flying buttresses.Case in point, the medical establishment should have known that forcing everyone to wear masks and get vaccinated against Covid was unnecessary, stupid, and perhaps more dangerous than the virus which, for most people, was no more dangerous than the flu. They moved in lockstep to support these policies however. There were largely two reasons for this:They knew that the Covid hysteria expanded their power in society.They knew that the rest of the managerial octopus would back them up.Each of the octopus’ tentacles thinks this way. They know the rest of the organism will support almost anything they do, particularly if there is some specialized type of knowledge they hold (such as medicine) that the other parts of the animal don’t have. They are thus safe from any push-back fromwithinthe ruling class. Resistance from the peasant class, even from very intelligent and knowledgeable members of that class, can be successfully dismissed as unscientific, backwards, racist or any number of other synonyms for badthink.

        We’re in a position similar to that of blacks, and like them we are going to have to become demanding and unruly or we get stepped on.   It’s to the point now where this can be explained to people in common language and to get them on board.   No intellectual academic stuff is needed.   Just say we are becoming a minority, the government holds us in contempt and has no respect for us because we never fight back, and we don’t like being punished where there are always two of them to one,of us and we are going to band together like,it or not.   And if you don’t like then try throwing us all in prison.it’s that simple.

            Yep. When you think about it, Britain ironically has become a mirror image of the old South African regime in that a racial minority rules via force against the majority and uses cops from the latter to do so. Come to think of it, that’s been the case to a degree somewhat throughout the West for 80 years.

                    I am in denial? I think you are not understanding what I am saying. Peasant protests by themselves have never achieved anything ever in the history of mankind. Being unruly is literally what children do. It’s an admission that you lack power and only can throw fits.“Demanding” towards whom? Your masters? This is what the word implies.Instead, Whites need to totally reject the current system and the authority of the people currently ruling our countries.What can actually work is having a secondary dissatisfied elite on your side, being organized, having leaders and most importantly, having thirst for power. Popular unrest is at best a supporting means to achieve your goals.

                            Destabilizing without a viable and ready alternative is unlikely to have desirable results.
You are right that a secondary elite may get created (or motivated or activated) by the unrest, but it also may not. It’s better to actively help the process.
People go rage in the streets and then have a sense of accomplishment without actually making any real difference. This is what happens most often.

                                        The Bolsheviks were also bankrolled by NYC globalists. Excellent commentary here. Civil unrest is very emotionally attractive, but it’s not practical, nor makes things better, and history is littered with the examples of it.

                            Historically civil unrest makes the immediate problems worse. There’s never “and it solved everything” ending in real life. Yes, the riots in the UK will exert pressure. In the immediate term it will make everything worse. We need leaders who are working with the existing power structures.

                        He’s imperfect, but the nominally richest man in the world has been making noises for some time. There’s a dissatisfied elite, and I’m sure there are others with a lower profile, not that their agendas are a perfect match, not that these things ever are. I hazard to guess the situation is more hopeful by the day, contrary to appearances. These things take time but snowball, and we could be not far off.I get what you’re saying, and it’s been my thinking for a while, but Musk coming out openly for Trump seems significant to me. The reasons he gave were pretty solid iirc.

        One reason for the longevity of our systems is that “democracy” in the West offers copious amounts of hopium in the form of almost inconsequential elections. So instead of saying “that’s it!”, breaking a chair and running up the jolly Roger, people decide to “vote harder”. It’s a tragically effective way of buffering an evil system

                Yes, intermittent reinforcement, Except that the reinforcement is getting your side—Reps or Dems—in office, not in changing your particular physical situation. Hence the term “uniparty” applies.
There is also another interesting phenomenon, “conditioned elation”. That’s when you get reinforced *beyond* your expectation. So when a Trump comes into office, folks go wild (elation) as vs a plain old run of the mill uniparty candidate like Bush III.
Oh, to be a freshman in university once more. Those Psych classes were amazing.

        Instead it has nodes that control specific domains, like banking, the media, the academy, and so on.
Nodes?  Don’t you mean Noses?  To their credit, they know how to take control through force multiplication.

        I believe Switzerland is one of the most democratic countries in Europe as every citizen can bring up a petition which, if they get enough signatures, has to be put to a Democratic vote. This is why back in a November 2009 referendum, a constitutional amendment banning the construction of new minarets was approved by 57.5% of the participating voters. However, if the demographics shift in the future, it could just as easily go the other way.While Constitutional changes are quite difficult, they are not impossible nor without president as was the case in the USA with the 18th/21st Amendments over 100-years ago. And especially if the majority of the ruling elites control congress, the senate or the majority of seats in parliament, citizens can wake up one morning and quite easily find themselves on the wrong side of a new law with nothing to say about it.Here in Europe, and evidently the UK, US and Canada, whether you have a senate, congress or parliament, citizen voting obviously makes no difference since our overlords can change their political alignments on a whim in order to maintain status quo as the French recently demonstrated or what seems to be going on with Kamala Harris and the Biden (Obama) regime.﻿Even without Constitutional changes, the ruling elites can simply decide not to uphold a law on certain demographics while imposing it on others as we are currently witnessing in the UK. Not unlike what was going with BLM and Antifa riots across the US not so long ago.The very idea, let alone the practice, of democratically held elections is nothing more than an illusion so the plebs can at least believe they have a say about what goes on in their government every few years. Whether the election is fraudulent or not makes no difference. It’s not even as pessimistic as citizens “getting the government they deserve” because that implies they have a choice.Just like Nationalism and Patriotism, Democracy has no value in the dawning age of World Globalism.

            In a sense you do have a choice.  What US citizens lack is the will to enforce their choice.  That’s the difference between US and Venezuela – US citizens bend over and take it; Venezuelans bend the ruler over and give it.  Probably because we still have it too good here materially.
Which brings to mind the other way to keep the disgruntled satisfied: Enough bread and circuses.  But as young White males increasingly have nothing, and therefore nothing to lose, things could get spicy.

            The US “democracy” in practice is inverted.  In “democracy,” in theory at least, the people are supposed to decide what direction the country should move in and elect people to oversee that movement.
In practice, US “democracy” is where the elite decide what they want and then propagandize and/or browbeat the plebs into agreeing.
Even so, the problem is not really the form of government in this case. It is the evil satanic elite that is the trouble.  The main caveat here is a different elite would probably exist if we had a different form of government.

                “Inverted totalitarianism reverses things. It is all politics all of the time but politics largely untempered by the political. Party squabbles are occasionally on public display, and there is a frantic and continuous politics among factions of the party, interest groups, competing corporate powers, and rival media concerns. And there is, of course, the culminating moment of national elections when the attention of the nation is required to make a choice of personalities rather than a choice between alternatives. What is absent is the political, the commitment to finding where the common good lies amidst the welter of well-financed, highly organized, single-minded interests rabidly seeking governmental favors and overwhelming the practices of representative government and public administration by a sea of cash”

            The very idea, let alone the practice, of democratically held elections is nothing more than an illusion so the plebs can at least believe they have a say about what goes on in their government every few years.It’s a bit more sinister than that. When you vote, you symbolically kneel to your sovereign and swears him blind loyalty. After you’ve cast your vote, you no longer have a moral right to complain about government overreach, because you agreed to the rules when you decided to participate: the winner gets to spend your monies as he sees fit, even if your guy didn’t win.Very bad for your mental health, voting.But fear not, Doctor Krull has the medicine:1) Get your party elected to the parliament/House.2) Make a website where every bill that goes to the floor of the legislature is put to a poll.3) Let your members of parliament/House of Reps vote according to that poll: i.e. if the matter returns a 30%/70% yea/nay on the website poll, that’s replicated in chambers.Now you have direct democracy, and it didn’t require any constitutional amendments. But since you can’t be bothered to read every bill yourself or vote ten times a day, you appoint a representative to cast your website vote for you. It could be an existing politician or party, or just any random blogger or vtuber.That brought us back to representative democracy, so here’s the kicker:4) at any time can you a) appoint another representative or b) cancel the vote he cast on your behalf and vote manually. So when your guy suddenly discovers, “hey, racism is bad! I’m pro amnesty now!” you vote against the amnesty manually and appoint another rep.So you go to Uncle Norm and sell him this: you can click “Democrat” or “Republican” or “Rand Paul” or whatever on the website and you’ll be voting as you’ve always done. Only, with Krullocracy, you have a veto if your party effs you over.This, of course, only fixes half of the problem because you can’t run the executive that way, but with the legislative under your control, you can do an awful lot of good.

                “Let your members of parliament/House of Reps vote according to that poll: i.e. if the matter returns a 30%/70% yea/nay on the website poll, that’s replicated in chambers.”Concept excellent, implementation dicey.  Why?How is one’s vote on the matter at hand determined/counted/audited?  Look, we have voting (via paper ballots) at the general electorate level now which seems subject to shenanigans of all sorts, and that is paper and pencil stuff.Supposedly, there’s a ballot to be found for very vote, yea or nay.  Yet, the accusation is that “ballots” are often magically created and interjected into the system, or that folks voting have not cast the ballot that has their name on it.Now we are voting via the Internet?  When we’ve not been able to straighten out paper balloting?I’m writing this comment via my IPad, but after I hit the “post comment” button, it might as well be magic.  Seems your tool of universal suffrage (internet) itself an impossible alternative to police.

        “The point is the so-called democracies of the West have been unpopular for an exceedingly long time …”European and North American democracies were always a farce but today more than ever. If we go back to the French Revolution, it seems to have been about supplanting the monarchy and its allied institutions (aristocracy + church) with an urban bourgeoisie, but needing peasant and urban lumpenproletariat unrest to bring it about. That urban bourgeoisie seems to have morphed over time into a transnational financial oligarchy, largely dominated by members of the Tribe.Now that there’s a crisis of Western “democracy”, the gloves are off and the iron claw of the regime in full view. We see that iron claw in myriad forms — the clampdown on British protestors, the harassment of Trump, the tailing of Tulsi Gabbard. I haven’t even mentioned France and Germany. We’re probably close to the 1848 moment.

                It was a revolutionary upsurge throughout Europe that lasted over a year but which had an enduring impact on the evolution of Europe. It’s difficult to encapsulate in a few words. Mike Rapport’s book might be one place to start.

                    Correct. And incidentally, in the aftermath of this revolutionary fervor, Marxism began gaining purchase. If 2024 proves an analogue of 1848 we can only hope the ensuing radicalism veers toward the other end of the ideological spectrum.

                1848 is called The Spring of Nations, or the Revolutionary Year, because Europe saw a number of monarchies and empires overthrown and replace with democratic nation states.

            I would change Z’s formulation a bit. Hence, Western governments have been unpopular for an exceedingly long time, but the concept of democracy remains popular to this day. However, as governmental legitimacy crumbles, that may be changing. The Grillers may finally be subjecting democracy to a bit of scrutiny, although that’s largely conjecture on my part.

                It’s a slow process, in the sense that I once was a griller, and now I’m here, but the grillers are yet legion. The GR and the regime’s technocratic control grid are proceeding at a much faster pace, thus there is unlikely to be any mass “awakening” before it’s too late.

                    It is an interesting race. The pogrom and the social status portions of the control grid means waking more people up and waking them up faster.
This is where we need organization to funnel them somewhere other than, “fighting the woke.” An explicit advocate based on ethnos/race can arise. As soon as he or a few of them arise, they will have somewhere to go and they will go there.
The regime’s inflation and crumbling economic order is also a source of discontent. All it has in terms of legitimacy is offering financial comfort.

        The managerial polyarchs, whose unstated ideology is postmodern fascism, can massage popular discontent only so long as conditions on the ground are at least palatable to the common man. But once the life of the common man become hellish enough, all the soothing words and heartening promises of future redress fall upon deaf ears and stony hearts, and simmering hatreds erupt into mass violence.This is what apparently is happening in the UK. Life for the common Brit has become so miserable, thanks primarily to the savages imported by the Power Structure, that comforting words from on high are not only no longer effective, they are downright infuriating.My dearest hope is that large numbers of British elites perish hideously in the paroxysms their treasonous policies engendered. And that rather than refresh the tree of democracy, the shed blood nourishes a new system of government.

        Managerial Polyarchy refers to the fact that large complex society does not have central controlMost of the time it looks that way, but during the plandemic all these “nodes” not only quickly but instantly fell into lockstep with previously unimaginable “mandates” that were coming from somewhere. Nor do we see any substantial dissent in the western “polyarchy” against Israel during its Gaza genocide, in spite of some popular dissent. Dissent significant enough that you’d think you’d see a node or two perhaps break off, but that hasn’t happened. The west is even more united in support of Israel than it is of Ukraine, and that’s saying something.

            You can say it is de-centralized in that the nodes control the various aspects of society.  But it does seem the nodes themselves are controlled, or at least coordinated.  There are occasional disagreements among the various nodes, but enough of the nodes appear to be sufficiently controlled to cancel the rebellious ones.
I think the biggest shortcoming in thinking there is no central control is believing that such control needs to be perfect or complete.  It just has to be enough to reach the goal.

            The nodes cannot break away because their inmates are all of the same mind. They’ve attended the same universities and imbibed the same ideology, and the process has been going on close to 60 years. These are cells of an identical brain. And the brain seems proof against cancer, unfortunately.

            There is another piece to this that I did not mention. The people inside the system are unusually good at convincing themselves they have things under control. They convinced no one, for example, that Biden was on top of things. They merely convinced their media organs, who parroted back what they heard, which is what they always do. This was a problem in the Soviet Union, by the way.

                True. They also did a shockingly bad job convincing people about the necessity of the Ukraine war. Some of that could have been the hangover from the multitude of Covid lies, but in days of old the public could have been whipped up into a much larger and sustained frenzy over the ol’ debbil Putin.

                    They did a shockingly bad job at convincing 80% of America.  The other 20% had Ukraine flags flying in their yards.  I live in what is known as a conservative community, and the crossing guard for a local elementary school lived in the house on the corner by the school.  He has had a huge Ukraine flag on his fence where the kids cross the street for YEARs.A buddy of mine is a Russia-phile.  Lived there for years, and was an attache.  He would go on and on about how I just didn’t understand how the Russians think.  Ukraine would prevail and the Russians would remove Putin.  About a year into it, we were talking about the vaccines of all things.  (he was heading in to get shot #5 in 12 months)  In answer to his questions about it, I just said, “I wake up every morning and ask myself, ‘How are they lying to me today?&#x27;”  He sat there, stunned as I shifted from vaccines to UKRAINE and how they were obviously losing the war badly.  “Remember when you told me this would be over by last summer?  How has that worked out?  Everything you think you know is a lie.”To his credit, he didn’t get the 5th shot.  For a few months anyway.  Then he got it, and wound up with chest pains which he insists had nothing to do with the shot.These people cannot be saved.

                            So true.  I keep asking myself how they can fall for lies over and over, with the new lies contradicting the old.  But it’s not about the specifics of the lies.  It’s about the need to belong to a hive and to feel superior.  A large part of this is trying to replace the God they don’t believe in.

There is no changing the vast majority of White people over 50.  They will die before giving up on civic nationalism, the ‘melting pot,’ and their fantasy of a mosaic country.One can only hope that a remnant of White people – who identify as such and won’t apologize for their existence – survives and decides not to submit and die out.  I hate being the black piller but I think it’s questionable.  So many people make excuses for their gay kids, their non-White spouses and grandkids, their IKAGO neighbors, etc.  I think a majority of Whites have totally lost the survival instinct.  I can only hope I’m wrong.

                            No doubt a substantial number of people want to cling to these fantasies and, yes, they tend to be our age. The propaganda works on them solely because they want to believe it and find comfort in doing so. The red pill, to the degree it is one, is that the Regime is so vicious, violent, impulsive, and ham-handed it may overplay its hand and force those who are not brainwashed and supine to respond. I tend to think that will happening and is happening. The resolution remains unknown but the sorting is the right response. The English have less ability to do this, of course.

                            This is why so many are counting on Trump to win.  They see him as a savior.   Admitting that he will not save them and that the entire system will need to be replaced is too painful for them.

                                My neighbor is another one relying on Trump to save the country.  He understands race differences, Jay-power, the false flags, etc yet believes in the Q posts and that White hats are currently at work to arrest the regime bad guys.
I finally understood him when I sent the Modern Politics video about the 20,000 Haitians dumped into Springfield, Ohio and he said he didn’t want to watch it because it’s “too depressing.”  He previously avoided similar material, which finally clicked with me that he wants to cling to hope.  Not uncommon I think.

                        I have no desire to save them.  As much as they hate me, it cannot compare to the level of disdain I have for them.  I will never help these people if they are in need and I will not have any remorse, sympathy or compassion for them.  It’s as raw as it gets. People like me are admittedly a product of the regime.  I refuse to apologize for my people’s existence, and I will forever carry that hate to my grave.  It is unfortunate, because I’d love to be able to go back to enjoying the things this country once offered, but I have faced the reality that that cannot ever happen.  I’ve lost a lot of my humanity, and I’m not proud of that, but I cannot deny reality.  Let them burn in hell.

Of course not—for the most part.  To believe the above you must believe in the equality of all men and the perfectibility thereof.
God and Nature tell me differently.  If and when I meet someone  with higher authority than those two, I’ll consider a change of mind.

                That, and there are millions of left wing zombies (i.e. your cat lady aunt or cucked brother-in-law) who turn like a flock of migrating birds when they receive new instructions from the magic glowing box and national propaganda radio.It was absolutely hilarious after Biden’s “debate” that the ENTIRE FLOCK immediately changed direction within 2-3 hours. He went from being a modern DaVinci to Uncle Teddy fromArsenic and Old Lacewithin a day.That is a staggering level of population control. I remember vividly during the plandemic how my brother-in-law took to wearing TWO masks. He and his wife were going on about it, and my wife looked at them and said, “Then why not wear three?” which ended the discussion with their complete humiliation. The next day, walking around one of the local mountain towns outside, none of my family was wearing a mask, so the brother-in-law wasn’t wearing his. This went on for maybe 15 minutes then I noticed the wife glaring at him…and on went the two masks. Outside. At 9,500′.  Where UV kills viruses in a fraction of a second.This is the same family that, upon hearing we had taken our kids to ride roller coasters at Sea World (FL), lectured us on the PBS documentary “Black Water”. This went on for a while, and I just looked at them and said, “I don’t know. The whales seemed pretty happy to me!” and laughed. Then I pointed out that whales in captivity do a lot to protect animals in the wild. And in exchange for this, they are fed and treated really, really, well.That flock of birds thing is a real phenomenon, and we have no counter to it.

                    I keep coming back to this because it is the only thing I recall from the book (not movie) “A Wrinkle in Time” (the rest otherwise forgettable:The scene where the brother and sister finally meet up with the aliens and are being fed steak and potatoes or something.  The sister is eating and asks her brother why he isn’t.  He explains it is just slop, but they are penetrating your mind enough to make you think it is steak and potatoes.Matrix kind of stole this scene too, except the character knew it was fake, and preferred it to reality.There are many sisters in this country who can be fooled into thinking it is steak and potatoes.  There are also many who like in Matrix, prefer it.

                            Legal pot is “soma”.  Narratives are the “feelies” from the novel.
My wife turned on NBC to try and watch the Olympics over dinner.  (I have no idea why, she saw clips of that satanic opening ceremony.).  20 minutes into the broadcast they were on their THIRD “human interest story” and had not shown a single competitive event.  I had been trying to ignore it, and finally just got up and turned it off.  Blessedly, she has not bothered with it since.

                                Over the last 20 years or so, the Olympics have become globoheauxmeaux’s demonic bacchanale, with the media its amplification. What with the wine-aunt human interest stories and the gratuitious slobbering over every negro and perv competitor, I’d rather scrub public crappers in Shreveport than watch it.

        Britain is moving into naked, in-you-face police state mode. It’s the only way to keep a lid on a multicultural “society”. Z is right that the Brits need a leader – they need a Magoa, a war captain who will do what it takes. If they can’t have peaceful revolution, as JFK said…but if/when they start down the path of violence, they need to be willing to see it through. No half-measures.

        Internal opposition is assimilated into the system so quickly that it never has time to flower into a palace coup.Biden disagrees, as does a series of toppled UK prime ministers (it is doubtful Starmer joins the ranks of the unemployed so quickly only because his party is the government one, but even that could happen). Granted, the internal opposition in these cases is factional rather than inner party/outer party or citizen/Regime, but palace coups are all the rage in these formerly great democracies. That dusky faces show up as Regime enforcers and puppets indicates the actual immediate reason for the tumult: the very tenuous dominance of factions led by those hostile to the heritage populations.The West, in fact, is trying to deal with the discontent by physically replacing the heritage populations. As has happened with Antifa/BLM in the United States, the British Regime has deployed an army of color and freaks to assist its storm troopers. It too will rule by force until the day it cannot due to the depth of disgust and dissatisfaction. The Western democracies are in a running battle with oppressed and highly intelligent majorities in their homelands and a constant state of rioting and civil war is in the cards. Areas willde factobreakaway in nations large enough where it can happen (Canada, United States, to a lesser extent Eastern Europe and perhaps even sections of Germany and France), but in the nations where there is less elbow room such as Ireland and Britain constant strife is in the cards. The latter two will descend into a new version of the Troubles despite possible Wilders and Meloni kabuki acts.It actually is a time to be hopeful and joyous despite the black pills being shoved down our throats. The beginning of the end is in the rearview mirror and we are entering into the long, twilight struggle prior to the curtain falling.

            You are confusing ornaments for the tree. Tossing aside Biden is not a palace coup, because he is just a hired man. The system disposed of him when he ceased to be useful. Ditto for the string of PM’s in the UK.

                    You misunderstand the phrase “palace coup”. The White House is not the palace of the regime; it, too, is an ornament. Rulers live in palaces, not in the stage props of puppet show. Managerial polyarchy has many palaces (and offices), you see, and I’m sure that I’ve ridden past a few of those palaces this summer in the wealthy north shore suburbs of Chicagoland.It’s btw that I’ve not seen any Kamala for President signs in that area, not even in Wilmette this past Sunday. There is, tho, plenty of the the usual cult stuff like crooked pride flags and “Here We Believe”. Oh, and theBahá’í House of Worshipwas a beehive of clueless tourists who don’t understand what’s up.Followers of the Báb (the Gate) teach, for example, that children are mines loaded with gems. Presumably some of the mining is to be carried out while the kids are being zombified by “compulsory” state schooling which conforms to the Bahá’í theocratic ideal. Another teaching is aimed at establishment of world government and “a global civilization”.He taughtthe principle of the oneness of humanity —that every human being has a unique purpose to help bring about a unified world, that justice enables each of us to fulfill this potential, and that the inequalities between women and men, black and white, rich and poor, East and West must dissolve.They have eight or so continental temples sprinkled around the world.Acc. to a websiteof the Bahá’í Community of Wilmette,the “House” in Wilmette is the oldest. It was, according to the temple’s visitor center, completed in the 1950’s after several decades of construction. Thecompany headquartershowever of this theocratic cult is in Acre and Haifa, Israel. This is AWFLy convenient for a later switch after the bait has been taken by many gullible, superstitious egoists, including some of themany affluent, unwhite, females at the House on Sunday.

                    Right. And additionally, the West’s Power Structure is far more amorphous and diffuse than the Communist Party of the USSR, while being less centralized and more flexible. It’s not so hard to crush a cockroach. Liquidating an amoeba is far trickier.

                Similar to Trump in 2016, I think Musk saw an underserved market and tapped into it, at least to the extent the regime allows.  Gab, for all its faults, is at least closer to what Twitter, stupidly renamed X, should be.  Unfortunately for Gab, it just doesn’t have the market share of Twitter, stupidly renamed X. It is the Linux of social media.

        Management Polyarchy is an effective adaptation for the Ruling Class in a democracy. It distributes power, so there’s no single point of vulnerability. Nobody can be held responsible for anything. It ameliorates intra-Elite competition. In theory, it should be more flexible because it has more nodes for feedback-gathering and innovation. In practice, it has become Kafka’s Castle.

        Speaking of weird – I want to know what’s up with the middle aged white guys who are fully on board with replacement. Not just fully on board, but it seems like their entire life goal is to import as many brown weirdos as possible.The most obvious example is Keir Starmer. In Canada, we have Trudeau, but also Marc Miller and Sean Fraser, 2 white immigration ministers who only care about bringing in as many immigrants as possible. Then you have all the police chiefs, beat cops, etc. You have Joe Biden and Lindsey Graham.What’s going through their head? Why do they want to destroy Western civilization so much? They aren’t even gay or seemingly off at all. They aren’t foreign. At least foreigners in power acting like that makes sense.Do they not have any moderating voice of self preservation? I actually think that voice has gone off in alot of regular white guys who are now noticing. But for many others, all they want to do is destroy their own civilization.

            They subscribe to Wokism, which is a postmodernist form of Gnostic Christianity.  The Gnostics believed the material universe itself was flawed and sinful and only through the direct knowledge of the hidden true divinity could salvation be obtained.  The Woke adherents believe believe that Western civilization is inextricably bound to whiteness (which it is).However, instead of believing that, on balance, Western civilization has been a force for good in the world, the Wokies believe that Western civilization is solely defined by its sins: racism, genocide, slavery, exploitation and colonialism.  These sins can only be expiated by the ultimate eradication of whiteness, as whiteness is the foundation of Western civilization.

        The forest fire analogy is an apt one. In this example, I attempt to show that forest fire management is a good metaphor for government mismanagement.In much of North America, forest and prarie fires are a problem. The managerial state variously will blame them on “climate change”, as if tinderbox-dry conditions had never happened in history, or paying lip service to environmentalism. After all, cutting down trees is anti-Gaia. What are you, some kind of shill for the timber industry? Less noble motives might be to prioritize limited budgets for more enjoyable uses, perhaps salaries, pensions and “business” trips to exotic destinations. It’s impolitic to ask why the East Buttplug County Fire Management District must hold its annual meeting in Hawaii. What business is that of yours, Citizen?Common sense land management policy with an eye to minimizing the risk of fire is overlooked or actively dismissed. And then people are upset when a cigarette butt tossed out of a car’s window, or a homeless encampment’s fire gets out of control and thousands of acres are reduced to ash. Not usually, but sometimes with a rather high human death toll, as last year’s fire in Hawaii can attest.

            I’ve heard that a major part of the fire problem today is 100 years of not allowing forest fires.  When you allow periodic natural fires to occur (by not putting them out), it burns away all the brush, all the saplings and very small trees and other vegetation.  But by not allowing these smaller fires, fuel builds up which allows a bigger, hotter fire which can then set alight the larger trees that would have survived a small fire.

                Arson also seems to be an increasing problem. Recently in southern New Mexico a couple of Mescalero Apaches set multiple fires around the town of Ruidoso. A couple of people died and Ruidoso came fairly close to being reduced to cinders.

                    That explains the frequency increase, but perhaps not the increasing intensity and damage from such fires.  Also, the official Forest Service policy is to check for recorded lightning strikes and other nature causes and if those are not in evidence to *officially* designate the cause of the fire as “man made/caused”.
I’ve never been able to wrap my head around that logic—however, I’m not a government bureaucrat.

                        Last year or the year before there was a huge fire, I think it was in Canada.  Turned out there was a female firefighter’s convention where they were going to set a small fire, though I forget the rationale for it and they were supposed to put it out.  Needless to say, they burned down the whole forest.   Funny.A quick Google search returns….From the Washington Free Beacon:“What happened: Female firefighters taking part in a Women-in-Fire Training Exchange program—intended to promote “mental health and gender diversity and inclusion”—accidentally caused an “out of control” forest fire in Banff National Park. Residents in the surrounding areas were evacuated and several buildings were damaged on May 3 after the female firefighters initiated a prescribed burn that quickly escalated into an uncontrolled blaze”

            Wildfires are not a problem.  They are reality.With respect, “common sense land management policy” (like “natural disaster”) is a contradiction in terms.  Whose sense?  Disaster for/to whom?  Risk for who and what?A “common sensehomo sapiensmanagement policy” would be more effective and beneficial to all species involved, humans above all.Tars is correct.  But full-suppression of all wildfires was only the first step down this road.  Who wanted this?  At the time basically everyone, but especially the timber industry.The current unpleasantness is the result of dozens of interlocking factors, most of which are grounded in ecological illiteracy.  Some of these, in rough chronological order:A century of full-suppression in most placesHalf a century of well-intentioned but ill-concocted and misapplied environmental legislationA misanthropic environmentalist movement (the real, pre-Algore movement)A propertyuber allesmovementSentimental NIMBY-ism on the part of ignoramuses who either don’t have yards or could not tell you the name of anything growing there if they doPolitical gridlock caused by all the aboveA long trend of warmer and drier weather, the response to which has been denial by some and hysteria by others, but a refusal to think seriously by almost allBudget/staffing cuts to the agencies involvedMigration of REI-inspired urban and suburban refugees into rural areasDEI hiring policies forced on agencies involved in managing public landsBasically, we’re looking at a hundred year problem in search of a hundred-plus year solution.The first step to a reality-based policy would be acknowledgement of these and other realities.  This is the last thing I see happening.  Especially under Our (or any other) Democracy.

                Loss of forests due to excessively hot/intense fire is only part of the problem here in the West.  We are losing even more of forests to an infestation of “bark beetle” increased by drought.  I’ve flown over bast tracts of forest that are complete dead.  Dead as in completely brown, not green.  Why?Well it seems trees previously took care of the beetle with sap, however lack of water equals lack of sap and the tree dies.  But that’s not entirely due to drought, only exasperated by it as we’ve had droughts on and off for millennia.  What we have now are 3 or 4 times the number of trees drinking the limited rain fall during this multiyear drought (25 years and counting).Moral to this story:  Think twice before you fuck with Mother Nature, and I’m no tree hugger.

            It’s also important to note that many species of trees (pines for example) actually need fire in order to reproduce.  The cones protect the seeds from the fire and then the fire burns off the underbrush releasing nutrients and allowing sun to reach the forest floor.
Feels like there’s a pretty pertinent analogy in there…

            “…as last year’s fire in Hawaii can attest.”
Perhaps someone with knowledge can fill in, but I heard that the warning system used in those fires was for “tsunami” events. Those hearing such evacuated inland and into the rushing fires where there was no shelter, nor escape.
Has there been an official investigation of the matter and report? Not that such would not be a whitewash if the above occurred.

            Up here in Canuckistan, we had a huge fire rip through Jasper National Park. I have spent much time in the back country there and the forest floors were choked with dead fall and dead vegetation. (Dried pine needles = excellent fire starter.)  No one is surprised that in a dry year, it finally caught and burned so fast the locals barely got out of the way. I was there the day before it broke out and there were no signs of local fire…just lightning.

        Nothing changes until the environment changes. People in the UK are still content with street protests and the occasional riot because they can still buy a pint at the local pub and grouse with like-minded sods. Yes, its slow death by a thousand cuts, and there is a real risk that they will remain asleep until its too late. Best they can do now is remain under the radar and wait for a match to ignite the inferno. Rather than riot chaotically, know what you will do as remedy. Be focused and definitive. If each of us pulls just one weed from the garden, the environment WILL change for the better. Nothing less works.

        “One of the strange truths about democratic governments is that they can remain unpopular for much longer than other forms of government. This seems counterintuitive as the whole point of democratic government is to have public policy reflect the general will of the people.”Given how it works, I would think a non democratic government wouldn’t be as unpopular.  Without a “democratic” government, there wouldn’t be all the propaganda and endless news stories about government.  There wouldn’t be all the agitation we have today.  “Influencers” would be stuck shilling bad food and VPNs.  Our approval would not be sought. Our outrage would not be stoked. The news would report on things important to us as opposed to crying about what a meany Orange Hitler is.

            Quite. And this gets to a point Z has made in the past. Namely, that in non-democratic systems the masses tend to their knitting rather than set themselves up as poltical savants for the simple reason that they do not involve themselves in government. In democracy, contrariwise, the masses are morally obligated to participate in government, which personalizes politics to a huge degree. This is a recipe for upheaval when things turn sour.

        It’s interesting that when I listen to other like minded people and even normal conservatives in my lifewe all have problems defining just what is it that we face and what do we call ourselves whom oppose what we face?I hear the normal conservatives that I associate with call it socialism or communism and even fascism.I don’t hear many normie conservatives use the term managerialisn yet.Managerialism is a term that sounds like their bosses golf outing but in reality the term that James Burnam coined is an accurate term for what we face. I enjoyed that podcast on managerial polyarchy and it fits well in identifying the multiple nodes to the managerial system that rules us.Now what to call ourselves…dissidents, conservatives, traditionalist, the new right, the right, christian nationalists….. maybe it doesn’t really matter?

        There is a long article by James Piereson for the 50th anniversary of the Nixon resignation that analyzes managerial chic through the special-prosecutor fetish. The romance of Watergate is not confined to D.C. people who materially benefited from it and developed a kind of class consciousness as a result, but seems to have spread internationally since the U.S. Dept. Of Journalism became priest-publicists for the lifestyle, pageantry, and priorities of that regional mafia. Thus a publishing house is economically justified to deliver “The Mueller Report” for bookstores to stock and some quotient of status-attuned ladies will judge it fitting to pick up a copy. Though l guess “The Starr Report” was the original pron version of that.

        This coming a few days after the 75th anniversary of Mann Gulch, it seems appropriate to continue the fire metaphor.In theory, elections serve the same purpose as naturally occurring fires: they help maintain the forest they played a part in creating.In reality, the managerial state serves the same role as smokejumpers: preventing the natural process in order to maintain the status quo and extract short-term benefits.The difference between the poor jumpers and the polyarchs is that the former had little or no idea of the process or the role they were playing in disrupting the it.  Fires were bad because Bambi and had to be fought.  The Our Democracy thugs know exactly what they are doing and are simply lying about it.It has been more than thirty years since I read Dahl, but if memory serves there is and can never be “democracy”, only more or less democratic arrangements.  I do not remember if or how much he addressed what the republic’s founders saw as the inevitable cycle of democratic decay.But the inevitable cycles on.  Political smokejumping continues (e.g.AIPAC v. Squad) but each “success” only exacerbates conditions on the ground.2016 was a lightning strike that became a blow-up.  Eight years later, the regime has thrown everything it has at the Trump Fire but has never gotten a line around it.We will see if 2024 brings another big run.

        If there are any meaningful numbers of disgruntled within the managerial system, what’s it going to take to kick off the palace coup (coop as obomba would say)?  Meh, I’ll believe it when I see it.  Musk doesn’t strike me as that kind of leader, but maybe he should consider beefing up his security just in case.  On another note, this Walz dude seems like a real psycho…

            As much as I admire Z-man, one needs to look up the phrase’s origination via alternative sources. One such source, ChatGPT. To wit:“The term “managerial polyarchy” was coined by political economist James Burnham in his 1941 book The Managerial Revolution. Burnham used the term to describe a new form of governance that he believed was emerging in the mid-20th century, characterized by the dominance of managers and technocrats in both the public and private sectors. He argued that this new elite, rather than traditional capitalists or proletarians, would become the primary rulers of society, wielding power through bureaucratic and managerial structures.”AI is your “friend” or so we are told….

                For what it’s worth, the word “polyarchy” does not appear in a text search of my Kindle edition ofThe Managerial Revolution. I don’t remember seeing it when I read it some time ago. Not to say it isn’t in some editions, but it’s not in mine.
