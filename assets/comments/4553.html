        We have been dealling with a guy that has been in and out of jail. Mostly, he gets thrown in jail because he won’t call his PO or forgets court dates. These people, for the most part, make bad decisions, never accept responsibility for anything they do and don’t give a damn if they are sent back to jail. You or I would do those things to stay out of jail. They simply won’t.

        “Maybe that’s as good as it gets.”  Sigh, you might just be right.  Money has been spent, colloquies tendered, programs implemented,  set-asides granted, families discouraged, hiring preferences obtained, academic points added, excuses made, justifications shouted in our faces but the sad fact is that it has not solved the problem.  I don’t know the answers, I hardly know the questions but I know when systems work or do not  and the current “system” has produced our current situation, so new approaches need to be sought out and considered.

        If I recall correctly, it was John Lott who wrote that nothing good ever happens after midnight. That’s the top of the day for the feral population.
