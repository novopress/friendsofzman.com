        I just discovered your blog.  There is a really interesting idea in your post, in that the reaction of humans to humans creating robots that can do most of the work, is for the humans to take themselves/ ourselves out.  That possibility to automation has not been suggested by anyone that I know of, though maybe Asimov was on to it with the “Spacers” in one of his Foundation/ Robot sequels.I suspect there are human scientists right now working on creating silicon lifeforms with artificial intelligence, to which human intelligence can be uploaded.  These scientists and the people funding them are both crazy, but the combination of crazy people and advanced tech can do alot of damage.

        I think the end point of your logic in a as-much-as-possible-post-scarcity economy, say in which one million people can provide a middle-class lifestyle for eight billion, is massive addiction.
Sufficiently advanced virtual reality, good old drugs, and hyper-communication will result in people addicted to things other than reality.
