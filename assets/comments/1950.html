        As a NYC suburb dweller, I think you are taking this too seriously. It’s not a “war on poor people,” as these politicians couldn’t care less about poor people. I think the mistake a lot of people make about liberal/left politicians of this sort is that they think they are in politics/activism out of some sort of idealism and that if we could just appeal to that idealism, we could get them to see that their policies are hurting the people they want to help.In fact, it is much more useful to see the NYC Council as made up of hustling, dynamic political entrepreneurs. Their “brand” is caring about poor people. As long as the morons in their districts buy into it, why should the politicians care if they help them or not? It’s a drain on time and resources.So once 51% of their constituents are committed to the brand, our NYC Councilmen go in search of other revenue, among them the unions, wealthy activists, and small businesses that oppose WalMart. That is all this is: A new revenue stream.
