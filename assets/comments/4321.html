        In Missouri, I started carrying as soon as I was disabled. ca 2003. Being broke and a CCL costing $200, I open carried a $145 pistol. Later I bought a $225 pistol. Still later I bought my CCL. Been carrying concealed since. I did buy a better gun üôÇIn two years of constant OC in CollegeTown, USA, around a dozen people mentioned it and only one of those was a LEO. One was apologetic about asking me to return the weapon to the car. One was a hoplophobe who called 911 over an empty holster. The freshman LEO was just stupefied that somebody was carrying..

        I agree with the need for open carry laws as a remedy to risky transport laws.   I know a few Open carry fanatics and i think they would relax if the constant threat of new gun control actions were not in the picture.

            Open carry resolves all issues associated with legitimate transport of firearms
It also eliminates possible issues associated with, say, carrying a .22 in a holster when you are in the woods.  Growing up in a rural area and spending a lot of time hiking, I can say from personal experience that having a .22 at your hip in the woods can be a pretty handy thing to have.

        Living in Texas, I don‚Äôt have a concealed carry permit, and I don‚Äôt care to open carry. I figure any permit just puts you on some list. Besides, having a 45 for several months in Nam as my personal weapon (because I had a squad weapon, an M-60), they are a pain in the ass. Except when you really need it.

        The root of changing the concealed carry law to open carry in Texas has it‚Äôs root in the vagaries of how the concealed carry law was written. Under the ‚Äòconcealed‚Äô law, you (1) have to have a permit, and (2) it has to remain concealed. Change either of those conditions, and you could become a felon.You can‚Äôt show someone the gun (unless it turns into life and death), intentionally or inadvertently. That supposedly included ‚Äúthey could see the shape through your t shirt‚Äù. (Or so we told by the instructor lo these many years ago.)

            Ah, that would explain it. In Virginia, having a concealed carry is necessary if you plan to go to a range. The laws of transport are so weird and open to interpretation, taking a handgun to your range is hugely complicated. Get the permit and all of those rules go away. In some states, you are only permitted to transport a handgun to and from a range.
It‚Äôs just further proof that gun control has nothing to do with public safety. It is just a way for one group of white to torment another group of whites.

        No, criminals are not going to open carry. In NYC criminals don‚Äôt conceal carry and in Chicago they do‚Äìin NYC cops can and do stop and frisk. End of problem.
Vermont has  no permit  open and concealed carry. But the citizenry don‚Äôt carry because they have small dicks.

            Vermont appears to have an above average gun ownership percentage. I‚Äôm always skeptical about these numbers because they really on self-reporting and most gun owners don‚Äôt report. Whenever asked, I report owning no weapons, not even a butter knife. Yet, I could could be described as living in an armory. I agree with Phil Graham on the issue. I have more than I need and less than I want.

                If you keep an armory that tells me you don‚Äôt actually  reside in D.C. proper, which is what the Hood meant to me forty years ago when I lived there. Although. I read that urban pioneers are buying back D.C., but they are not 2nd amendment fans either.

        Still, I‚Äôm puzzled as to why anyone would want to open carry, other than small dick syndrome.
as a deterrent?
