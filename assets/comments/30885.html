            The British run the world! If that is so why can you say anything about them? No one will ever be de-platformed or fired from their job for libeling the English.
To help you with thinking may I suggest you try to consider the power of groups who you are not allowed to talk about. Groups who insist you have open borders but their country must always be their ethnic homeland.

        One unintended consequence of Clown World that is a good thing is it makes it impossible for those stuck and fixated on “numbers” to, now as of the present, get anywhere with it.  It’s to the point now that those who still won’t let go of this (almost all Conservative, Inc. types) get no traction with it and instead receive heated flak, or get laughed at (both well deserved).  A couple good case study examples from only the past week or two:1.  We not only have low-IQ vibrants running amok all over society, pretty much everywhere, doing material and bodily harm that cannot be ignored, now we also have a low-IQ vibrant in congress, who had a temper tantrum, sperged out, and pulled a fire alarm.  This is the behavior of 8-year-olds, even outlier behavior in this age range, of kids that suffer severe problems at home, or are spoiled to a jaw-dropping proportion, or else the behavior of college age kids (overgrown 8-year-olds) irretrievably into severe mental illness and so woke “activists.”2.  The brain damaged hobo in the senate, put out on stage by globohomo’s propaganda arm (legacy media) as their chosen spokesman, calling for reason, civility, propriety, and decorum (I’m really not making this up).  This had to have been done for lulz, literally motivated as such, by whichever globohomo managerialist was assigned this particular task in the overall scripting and performance of all this within the professional wrestling model (everything is now).  It’s literally intentional rubbing our noses in it, and only for lulz, as a cruel and sadistic pet owner might do to a dog.So I ask, how the hell do you go the “numbers” and make spiffy charts and graphs over any of this?  The answer is you don’t, nobody does, and so this particular old, tired out, and worn out Conservative, Inc. algorithm no longer plays.  Alas, this is at least one positive result of all this.

        If you were involved in the conservative movement in the ’80s and are a reader of this blog, then you are probably: (a) relatively high IQ (120+); (b) literate and at least modestly well read; (c) numerate; and (d) analytical. We have been objectively correct about every issue for the last 50 years. From a policy analysis standpoint, we are batting 1000.From a political standpoint we have been an abject failure, losing nearly every battle of consequence in the culture wars and in the political wars. As it pertains to the subject matter of this post, it is because the average voter is (a) relatively low IQ (100-); (b) functionally illiterate and poorly read; (c) innumerate; and (d) hopelessly lacking in analytical skills. This was true in the ’80s, and relentless immigration from low IQ countries makes it even more true today.The conservative movement does not know how to speak to these people. They tried to relate to these people using numerical/analytical policy arguments, which sailed completely over their heads. These people relate to life by way of narratives, and the political left has kicked arse because they presented politics as a form of narrative, without regard to the underlying facts. How many times have we seen people of the left use the phrase literally false, but metaphorically true when they get caught in obvious lies?It’s important to note that on the very few issues where conservatives are winning they are engaging by way of narrative, not bland factual/numerical analysis. The most recent example is the transgender debate. From an objective numerical standpoint, this issue is utterly irrelevant. Transgender people are an insignificant portion of our population and, consequently, do not impose any significant economic costs on society. Conservatives are winning on this issue by following/advancing the (objectively correct) narrative that transgenders’ behavior is aberrant and they are coming for your kids, both of which are conveniently true.I’m becoming convinced that the Pol board on 4chan is the most effective resource for our side. The picture board format of the site effectively forces content creators into a narrative format that is impactful for the average voter. There’s a reason that governments across the West are cracking down on Pol–it’s a damned effective source of memetic warfare.

            Guest: “I’m becoming convinced that the Pol board on 4chan is the most effective resource for our side.”I agree strongly with you there, however, I fear that there’s a lurking psycho-sociological trap into which we might be ambling.And it very much involves NUMBERS.81% of all Amurrikkkunz are now v@xxinated.SOURCE:https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states100% of all v@xxinated persons now have Myocarditis.SOURCE:https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.230743===============Setting aside the fact that 81% of all Amurrikkkunz now living will be dead of heart failure no later than circa the 2030s [and ignoring the associated implications for the collapse of the economy &amp; the society &amp; the civilization], what terrifies me is just the next few years, when the Normies all suddenly realize that they are going to die, and then they start looking for a scapegoat.I hate to tell you this, but the scapegoat ain’t gonna be Pfizer nor Moderna nor Johnson &amp; Johnson.The scapegoat will be you, the PureB100d.“BECAUSE IT ISN’T FAIR!!!”“IT ISN’T FAIR THAT WE HAVE TO DIE BUT YOU GET TO LIVE!!!!”“YOU SHOULD HAVE WARNED US!!!!!”“YOU ARE EVIL INCARNATE!!!!!!”“YOU ARE SATANISTS!!!!!!!”“KILL THE UNBELIEVERS!!!!!!!!”===============What I fear is that those of us in the far Dissident Right have been living in something of an echo chamber – we congregate here at Z, at Gab, at /pol/ and the like, but we don’t get out sufficiently often into the mainstream of society in order to experience enough Normie gibberish &amp; Normie nonsense so as to be able to properly intuit &amp; judge &amp; predict Normie behavior in real time.And I think our ignorance of Normie-Thought and Normie-Mass-Psychosis could be our undoing.Ergo I am now issuing a formal warning that all PureB100ds need to shut their mouths, delete their social media, stop sending TXTs &amp; emails, fly under the radar, and disappear into the shadows.I fear that we are incapable of imagining the pure white hot seething hatred which the Normies will have for us.We are entering highly perilous times.There will be bounties, blood curses, placed on all of our heads, by the Normies [as instructed according to their apoplectic rage].In their vindictiveness, as they watch their own children dying en masse, they will seek out and murder our children as retribution.tl;dr == If you’re PureB100ded, then learn to DISAPPEAR!!!!!And then ackshually DISAPPEAR.Especially your children.You’ve gotta hide your children.Off the grid.Under the radar.In the shadows.!!! HIDE YOUR PURE-BL00DED CHILDREN !!!===============One final prediction: As nurses &amp; midwives slowly come to realize that their state-mandated v@xxinations sterilized them and/or killed their own unborn children, via miscarriage or stillbirth, or left their born children so badly handicapped that they only survived for a few weeks, then there is going to be an apocalyptic outbreak of Von Munchhausen’s by Proxy throughout all the home health &amp; medical clinics &amp; the hospitals, with nurses &amp; midwives murdering healthy Pureb100ded children by the thousands, out of sheer sadistic Cluster B euphoria.“Vengeance is Mine!”, will be the rallying cry of the nurses &amp; the midwives.!!!!! AT ALL COSTS, KEEP YOU PURE-BL00DED CHILDREN OUT OF THE MEDICAL SYSTEM !!!!!The nurses &amp; the midwives will slaughter your children.[Not to mention the satanic pediatricians who have been dutifully serving the global depopulationist agenda by authorizing the j@bbing of the poor children in the first place.]

                Well, I’ve got eleven down-votes and counting, so at least eleven Bros here chez Z are either married to nurses or have daughters who are nurses [or maybe they’re the sons of nurses].HOPEFULLY the nurses in y’all’s famblies are the good nurses, the Pro-Life nurses, who would never in their worst nightmares deign to harm a patient.But the quickly diminishing pool of good nurses is being overwhelmed by the Cluster B Passive Aggressive Sadistic types who literally orgasm at the thought of murdering a patient.And, as a v@xxinated adult, if it’s a Pure-B100ded child she gets to murder, then that nurse will experience the biggest orgasm of her life.DO. NOT. DOUBT. ME.Keep your Pure-B100ded children the hell outta the medical system.The entire future of humanity depends on those very children.We simply cannot afford to lose any more children than we have already lost to the v@xxines.==========If you turn your back for ten seconds in a pediatric examination room, a Lucy Letbe will sneak in quietly and j@b your child so quickly with a v@xxine that you’ll never know what happened.You probably won’t even hear her dropping the empty hypodermic in the sharps container.Lucy Letbehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Letby[ There was a nigerian n!g-n0g, working in Texas, named Billy Chemirmir, who is believed to have murdered upwards of ONE THOUSAND elderly women in nursing homes. Just a couple of weeks ago, he was killed by a fellow inmate in prison.https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8047403/Serial-killer-illegal-immigrant-tied-THOUSAND-unexplained-deaths-indicted-murders.html]

            I would only add:
* Almost absolute control of the media by liberals, which controls our morality, our awareness of issues, and the relative importance of issues* That most intelligent people do not seem to have the ability to think independently, especially when immersed in liberal media hegemony* The electorate, the people, has vastly changed since the 80s due to massive immigration, both legal and illegal
Our elites have flooded us with less intelligent and more tribal people.

            Guest:  Very well said.  As one particular blogger has noted, effective rhetoric has to appeal to the listener.  Too many on our side use what they consider witty or appealing to their own intellect.  You need to engage the audience’s emotions, not their brains.  And at this point, as you note, the hell with pure logic or numerical accuracy – metaphorical reality and appeal to emotion are winning strategies.  Not to mention carefully crafted ‘verboten’ dog whistles – normiecon Whites are terrified of being considered rayciss.

            As much as I agree with what you’ve written, I would argue that its too late for memetic warfare to save us; even if we made a full-court press to utilize these resources properly. The Borg already has full control over the dominant social media platforms, MSM, and schools. Too much woke indoctrination has already been wired in to the mushheads and all the incoming illegals will do as they are told. We are outnumbered by sheeple and the jackboots will start rounding up the “insurgents” as soon as the flare goes up. We will need a new and innovative paradigm to succeed against this enemy.

                And /pol/’s meme production rate has been throttled to near-zero by the English-speaking staff of 4chan. The site is owned by a Japanese guy who has no idea what’s happening but has a vague sense that he should be “advertiser-friendly.” In Anglospheric practice that means being censored beyond usefulness and still boycotted by advertisers. /pol/ is “Tuckerized.”To anyone who thinks it still functions, I suggest reading it and attempting to learn something from it. You can’t. It’s all bots, lies, and things you’ve seen four hundred times already.To anyone citing the Norman Lincoln Rockwell AI art as a memetic win: The reaction from everyone sufficiently normie-right to have any capacity to exercise any power whatsoever is that those pictures prove AI is antisemitic because leftists didn’t lobotomize it correctly, so we have to do it again and again and again or Skynet’s gonna do anuddah Shoah.Enjoy the pics because they’re funny and they’re ours, not because they serve a persuasive or propagandistic function. Like all recent /pol/ “memes,” they’re *very strong* shibboleths. TOTAL TRANNY DEATH is not for mom’s Facebook.

            Don’t buy the self congratulatory “we’re simply too smart for everyone” theory.  Seems adjacent to the “nice guy” that feels all the girls haven’t realized how nice he is and as soon as they do they’ll drop their football motorcycle gang boyfriends and give him a chance.The left represents destruction, license, rebellion against God and all hierarchy (literally the “sacred rule”) thereby legitimated.  Plenty of smart people are leftist, probably most, in most places.  Shirking duty and doing the easy selfish thing does not appeal uniquely to the low IQ.Beautiful things come apart because bad people tear them apart and they tear them apart because they hate them.  The idea that evil is ignorance IS CORE to liberalism.

        Wait until you find out the estimated size of the reserve market. Quadrillion is the term you’re looking for.
Then again you’d have to know something about economics and finance or at least know of the market’s existence. They don’t talk about it for a reason.
Also, remember what I said, everyone, about Z not being able to see Musk is an obvious intel asset. That business wrapped up about as expected given my comment.

            It’s funny though, about the GDP claims…It’s true that every time the Feds spend a dollar on more government, the GDP goes up, because GDP these days is measured by expenditures, not actual production…But spending a dollar on government generally produces zero, but the money lost in taxes actually reduces real output…But the Conservatives continue to blather on about GDP, while the rest of the world has started relying on PPP….

        I’m a fraction of the way through dissident-recommended “To Build a Castle” by Soviet dissident Vladimir Bukovsky. Without giving anything away: As a troublemaker, he did time as a political prisoner. To while away the time during his many stints in the punishment cell, he’d sketch his imaged castle upon the walls. Furthermore he’d visualize in great detail life in the castle. I’m just speculating here, but seems to me the castle is a metaphor of the fairy tale promises of a glorious socialist future as opposed to the grim quotidian realities of life there.

            Keep reading. That is not at all what Bukovsky meant. If anything, as a metaphor, his castle refers to a bastion of civilization and warmth, well-protected against the follies of collectivist existence, filled with memories, friends, thoughts, etc. It may also be a metaphor for his own resistance: He spiritually LIVED in that castle, which is why they could not beat him and ended up tossing him out of the country. His “castle” was the symbol of his own defiance.
That is how I read it, anyway.

        A crucial flaw in US conservatism vs Us liberal/progressive/wokeism is that the conventional Right has refused to identify its ideology with concrete, identifiable and pre-existing groups.
Nowadays, if you are a “person of color”, Black most of all, if you are a woman, if you are a sexual outlier, you MUST be a Democrat. This is a great strength.
But with abstract non-racial and non-gendered ideas like “liberty” or, worse, “small government,” AND an utter REFUSAL identify being conservative with, for example, being White, conservatism is weak tea, cowardly tea, and perpetually losing tea.

Historically those abstract concepts were exclusively associated with whiteness, certainly in the 1780s when the country was founded. It was just plain common sense that these things did not apply to Negroes and “merciless Indian savages” as Jefferson described them.
The U.S. Bill of Rights was inspired by the English Bill of Rights of 1688, which of course was written for an exclusively white nation.

                I know this is a racist blog and all but in addition to the group differences in tribalism vs individualistic thinking and intelligence, mass democracy doesn’t work when it’s white men either. Jacksonian mass democracy and mass democracy in Europe after revolutions of 1848 didn’t work at all.Carl Schmitt talks about how a parliament might be a legitimate basis for a societal order when sufficiently aristocratic but the masses have no ability to think independently and are, and must be, essentially lead. This is a big point of Carlyle, as well.

            Imagine explaining to a a TEFL or TESL student why saying “persons of color” is good English but saying “colored people” is a thoughtcrime.  For instance, in Spanish: personas de color = good; personas coloradas = thoughtcrime.

                For the Leftist, the genitive case is morally preferrable because it notes race obliquely. Ergo, we avert our gaze as if you were a god when noting your pigmentation. The nominative case, OTOH, is direct and makes no pretense about race. You are not white, and we make no bones about it. There is no obeisance before the non-white.

            It actually IS possible to make “the ____ case for small government” or “the ____ case against utopianism” without recourse to referring to White people or their historical ideology. The problem is that you need to have embraced a large amount of Leftist utopiansim and race/sex blindness to think that it’s going to be possible to convince women, Blacks, etc… to accept these arguments. The Left owns Blacks, women, gays, and quite a few other groups because they correctly see that it’s generally in their simple, short-term interests to endorse political arrangements that plunder and oppress White men. They generally just lack the intellect, long-term perspective, and/or good will to follow abstract (race and sex neutral) arguments. This is not fixable.This is also the central irony of the whole Conserva-cuck movement. To believe you can prevail by appealing to reason and respect for freedom on the part of people who are often genetically and constitutively incapable of those things you already need to be about 80% a Leftist utopian – and if you’re a utopian Leftist, why are you pretending to be a Conservative at all?The Right slipped up when it forgot it’s own basic tenets. One of the most basic of those is that politics is a game of power and domination, not reasoned debate with imbeciles and savages.

        It’s all so fake and feminine I’ve begun not to trust anything I’m told now or have learned in the past.  ESPECIALLY foundational givens and assumptions.
I even happened on a discussion this morning that halfway made me start to consider if the Earth is really flat after all.  Further research needed certainly, but at this point I am not ruling it out.

            Here’s a good one.  American history has always told us Jesse Owens humiliated Hitler at the 1936 olympics and destroyed his theories about a master race.  I didn’t even know this until someone on Gab pointed it out recently:  Total medals for Germany – 101.  Second was the US at 56.  Some humiliation.

                Although I haven’t confirmed this, I have heard many times that Owens himself said that Hitler treated him with respect when they met and that it was FDR who disrespected him.But just as we can’t trust the economic numbers anymore, we can’t trust history.  Before I posted this, I tried to find the Owens interview.  The first few pages of my search were all “Owens humiliates Hitler!”  I may never be able to find that interview, if it even exists.I grew up in a high trust society.  Words fail to convey how jarring it is to now live in a time where I trust nothing that I read.  I don’t even trust the stuff that supports my current world view.

                    Hitler’s racial obsession was with “impurity” rather than “difference”. He hated Jews because their presence in western societies had tainted the bloodlines of the ancient peoples of Europe, especially the German stock. He hated Slavs because their long-term admixture of Asiatic peoples, especially the Mongols, had rendered them a mongrel people. He hated the gypsies on general principle, as normal Europeans do even today.In summary, Hitler was fussy about the racial constituents of Greater Germany, just as he was about his diet, much as vegans are today: It was all about Purity of Essence.Laura Hillenbrand’s ‘Unbroken’, an excellent biopic of Louis Zamperini (nb the movie is not good) describes the situation re Hitler and Owens (a teammate of Zamperini) very even-handedly; if I recall correctly, Owens greatly impressed Hitler.The Fuehrer supposedly dismissed  Americans as (again, if memory serves) a ‘mongrel nation of blacks and Jews’. Ignorant? yes: Stupid? yes; but again pointing to his obsession with the disturbance of POE.

            One of my shticks is the flat earth metaphor. In common usage of course, it’s meant as a term of ridicule, against someone with incorrect beliefs. Yet, I ask: For the average person, is it “incorrect”? Isn’t it a fact that for 99.9% of all the activities an ordinary person will ever do in his life, a two-dimensional representation of the world is adequate? Now it’s true that for some activities, the physical sciences, air and space travel, a three-dimensional model works better. Will you concede the point that, for all practical everyday purposes, flat earth is a useful tool?We go through life with various conceptions about how the world works. These are all, by definition, incomplete. The acid test is how well they represent the realities we deal with, which is equivalent to asking how accurate a facsimile of reality is our model?Somewhere in her novels, Ayn Rand has a character say (more or less): If things don’t make sense, then there is something wrong with your theory. Re-examine your premises.

        Today, no one discusses the numbers. Someone arguing for a policy on the grounds that it is good the economy sounds like someone arguing for free silver. In fact, it is the primary criticism of Conservative Inc.Yes, and the fact that this is the Dissident Right’s primary criticism of Conservative Inc., is the primary criticism of the Dissident Right (or ought to be).Unfortunately for some strains of Dissidentism, the boring financial topics really are the things that matter in the long run. The problem with Conservative Inc. was not that it focused on the wrong subjects, but that it was insincere and didn’t follow through with anything.Now we have a situation where the house is burning down because the adults in charge spent years ignoring the fire codes, running faulty wiring, plugging 18 toasters into one socket, and letting all the extinguishers expire. The Dissidents, ever quick to congratulate themselves on their supposed “realism,” demand that we focus all attention exclusively on the acute problem of the fire. “When the house is burning down, you don’t stop to worry about the tax code, you put out the damn fire,” they retort with an air of self-righteousness.That may be true as far as it goes, but in order to see the problem here, you only have to keep extending the metaphor. Does putting out the fire actually save the house? Not usually. Once the adrenaline junkies with the big trucks and hoses show up, all they do is complete the destruction of the house. They bust out the windows and soak everything for hours, and anything that was not lost to the fire becomes the victim of the firefighters. The Dissident Right, with their glee for destruction and apparent disregard for the long-term wellbeing of the homeowner, ought to be regarded with ambivalence similar to that extended to first responders.It falls upon the poor father of the family to do the hard work of rebuilding. He is the one who has to file an insurance claim, move his family into a hotel, pay off a now obsolete mortgage, and somehow find a new place to live, all while still going to work, getting the kids to school, and eventually purchasing new furniture and new clothes and new knickknacks with which to build new memories with his traumatized offspring.For the actual rebuilding process itself, the boring issues of law and the grinding facts of finance are highly pertinent subjects. It is only when a movement actually has a competence to address these that you can say it has come into its own. The idea that you just have to put out the fire first is initially persuasive, but it is ultimately wrong. There is no point in putting out the fire if you can’t repair the damage or indemnify the homeowner. The world does not need more adrenaline junkies. That’s what got us to where we are in the first place.

            ID, I look forward to your posts because of your intelligence and because you see the world so differently than I do.  I’m curious about why smart and honest guys interpret the world in a fundamentally different way than me.I look for short, revealing examples of where we disagree.  This is one:“The world does not need more adrenaline junkies. That’s what got us to where we are in the first place.”I believe that affluence made white people far too permissive in what they would accept and overlook, but I see our current situation as an intentional demolition.  Adrenaline had little role.

                Thank you for your kind words, LineInTheSand.I suppose the phrase “adrenaline junkies” was a bit hyperbolic on my part. By that I simply meant “shortsighted people who react strongly based on their own parochial views but do not see the big picture,” or something like that.Of course, this describes the majority of people, which is fine. It’s normal for normal people to be that way, and normal people provide the mass of men, the ordinary soldiers and workers, who carry out the decisions of the leaders. You just shouldn’t give a normal man too much responsibility and power, and leaders need to control the mass rather than carry out its whims. But that’s not really to your point.As far as intentional demolition goes, we run the risk of getting into a Talmudic discussion about what the meaning of “intentional” is. I don’t believe in secret cabals controlling the course of human history, but it’s certainly true that the Gramscian infiltration of the corridors of power to bring about “social revolution” has been a longstanding nd very deliberate program.

        The per capita debt is a pretty effective way to look at it.  While $33 trillion is inconceivable (you keep using that word), telling all 261 million adults in the US they owe $127,000 each, and the government will be by tomorrow to discuss your payment plan, would certainly get everyone’s attention.

            It’s even worse if you divide the debt only among gainfully employed individuals of positive net worth, who are the only ones who actuallycanpay anything towards it. Then it’s probably 4 or 5 times as much.

                    Of course, they chip in.  The problem is how much?  Last I looked, the tax revenue gleaned from the lowest 2 quintiles of the population was *negative*!  In short, the “poor”—even the “working poor” never produce a positive cash flow above their (welfare) benefits.  (Note: One should not define “welfare” to be simply cash payments like EBT and Head-of-Household IRS refunds.  There are myriad programs the working poor take advantage of—school, health care, etc.)

That is the most infuriating part, that it’s not even Fink’s money that gives him all the power.  At least Soros pretends to own the money he transfers from the CIA to lefty causes.

My biggest beef with the Church of the Almighty Dollar is that we’re supposed to worship the goals of the numbers, not just use them as a measure.
Worse, now that numbers are as fake as a bird’s liver, we’re supposed to worship the enlightened goals of…fake numbers.

        A very long book could be written on this subject.  The S&amp;P 500 is another example.  How did those stocks get in there?  Who chose them? Why is the energy industry so underrepresented in the index?  Scratching the surface you find a process for picking those stocks that’s far less objective than meets the eye, picked by a committee of obscure, left leaning people.  The fact that this index is a benchmark for every pension fund and money manager on the planet means nothing I guess.   You better pull for tech to outperform over the next five years if you love that retirement check.

            On your first point, it is mostly market cap weighted.  The top 10 are about 31% of the index.  Given they are almost all tech, you second point is very valid.  An additional point I would make is that those top 10 are dominated by far left, shitlib, democrat donors: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, Berkshire Hathaway.  The next layer is full of pharmaceutical companies.  In discussions with liberals, It’s fun telling them they are now the supporters corporate America and Big Pharma, and that we should raise the corporate rate to 50%.  You know, like they had been saying for 100 years, before Biden was installed.  You might as well be speaking Swahili.

        Some other commentators have mentioned the Covid numbers as an example of how unreliable and manipulative reporting can be.  It’s very difficult to determine how many people have died from a specific pathogen; it has to be done in arrears, usually takes months of analysis, and is subject to a wide margin of error.  (Medical historians still disagree widely on how many people died of “Spanish influenza” in 1918-1919.)  Yet in the spring of 2020 we were given an overnight mortality count from Covid.  To anyone knowledgeable about epidemiology, this number was obviously fabricated, but no one in authority disputed it.  If they’ll lie about disease and death, they’ll lie about anything, and are doing so.The Ukraine War is another example, although in war, the first casualty is truth and both sides present their sides the most favorably;  But claims that the Ukrainians are inflicting huge losses on the Russians are obviously false for anyone who has the slightest knowledge of casualties iinflicted and taken when attacking prepared fortifications; the attacker suffers much higher losses until a breakthrough is achieved.  Since that clearly hasn’t happened, Ukrainian losses will stay much higher than Russian.

            Saw another Larry Johnson interview where he points out that neither govt can effectively control social media, and that the Ukrainian posts are fully of pics and vids of cemeteries flying many many MANY flags over fresh graves. The Russian social media? No.

                No argument from me with Larry’s analysis,   But having seen literally dozens of social media postings from Ukrainian propaganda organs, if one is sentient and reasonably worldly, the bulls__t is obvious.

            Of course the primary technique of Covid cookery was to classify as Covid casualties those who died with Covid along with those who actually died from Covid. The former number is far larger than the latter, which suited the Power Structure just fine.

                Yes, with the initial impacts of Covid, was it that overarching disease, or was the mortality attributable to the opportunistic infections that walk through the door opened by one’s overwhelmed immune system (or especially in the case of Covid, the “treatments”, i.e., Remdesivir, and ventilation). In the beginning, the push was to blame Covid itself, while paying no attention to the deleterious “treatments”, or the comorbidities to pump the numbers in order to justify the instillation of panic to get people to take the jab.Sweet, huh; they increase the death and injury totals through this selective deception. But now, in the clear light of hindsight, it’s okay to concede that perhaps “some mistakes were made, but Only With The Best of Intentions”. The full bore effort to hide the magnitude of their knowing deception is dictated by their need to escape consequences, whether “they” are Big Pharma, grifters in the slipstream, or knowing mass murderers. It’s a near run thing for now, but maybe not for too much longer.

                I’m not sure if all jurisdictions did this, but where I’m from they classified anyone who died within 2 weeks of taking their hastily procured vaccine as ‘unvaccinated’.
Which means that if the jab was actually inducing a disproportionate amount of fatal reactions, it was also being used statistically to overstate the severity of COVID.

                It was not just classification cheating, but outright lies.  I know someone who is a Spanish interpreter at one of the largest hospitals in the country.  She said she saw non-English speaking patients test positive for Covid who would swear they were never tested.  Since both the government regulators and the hospitals wanted the numbers to be as high as possible, the incentives to fake numbers without consequence were overwhelming.

        Lies, damned lies, and statistics.I happen to love numbers, and especially statistics. But given the inherent racist nature of maff in general and statistics in particular, the very act of perpetrating Numbers While White will soon be deemed a crime. Espousing 1488 or noticing 13-does-50 can already get you fired and blackballed. Questioning six gorillion will get you gaoled in Europe, and soon enough here in the colonies, too.Calculation of BMI is rapidly becoming verboten due to disparate impact (women and minorities’ feelz hardest hit™). SAT/ACT results have been ditched by most colleges and universities by way of the same shaky reasoning.One of the biggest challenges for social justice going forward will be recalibrating AI to ignore and outright deny the most sensitive stats.

            Artificial intelligence models are already being calibrated to ignore, deny, or falsify the most sensitive statistics. They all include guardrails, which are essentially programmed limits on what they can and cannot address. They impose limitations on source materials used to train the models to eliminate from consideration sources which might introduce politically inconvenient truths. And they “tune” models by overweighting some inputs at the expense of other inputs.I am convinced that the United States will become a third-tier ghetto for AI precisely because AI models produced in the US will generate results that are completely at odds with reality due to the types of political interference described above. Europe will probably end up in the same ghetto. By contrast, an AI model developed in China or Korea will not be limited by the same political considerations, at least with respect to issues in the US.

                South Korea has an even stronger culture of official dishonesty than America has. The Korean fraction of Korean-ness, the part that’s somewhat independent of globohomo, is literally a feminist cult. That’s why their celebrity “androgyny” is sexlessness, rather than Anglo tranny perversion. They’re natural conservatives! (Grillers also.)I’m sure I’ve mentioned that my Japanese friends hate how their popular media is dominated by imported Korean faggotry that nobody but little girls actually likes (because they consume whatever they’re fed). Meanwhile American normiecons talk about what solace they find in Netflix, because unlike cable it offers Americans the choice of Korean TV’s refreshing old-fashioned normalcy. Voting with their dollars, as ever.Korean “AI” will be like Korea: America without men.

                    South Korea conservatives are impressive.  First off, their success at establishing their own version of celebrity androgyny as the unassailable standard of their society’s digital distraction from reality/false reality (an unwavering globohomo requirement).  Conservative, Inc. should find this much preferable, by an enormous margin, to our tranny freak show that is really nothing more than a digitized data-scrubbed/CGI version of the actual traveling circus carny midway freak shows of prior centuries.From there, firmly establishing conservatism as, in and of itself, an actual feminist cult is the true outstanding achievement.  This feature is what, more than any other feature, defines the South Korean version of conservative as the true, 24-karat, 200-proof conservatism.Better yet, South Korean conservatives have shown, in actual practice over years, that if they’re somewhat independent of globohomo, they are not at all a threat or a problem at all for globohomo, and they integrate right into it, perfectly assimilated into their assigned pod in the globohomo cube.Our own Conservative, Inc. should get up to speed on this.  I’m surprised they haven’t, and that they’re not promoting this 24/7 at volume 11, far and wide.  It’s conservatism perfected; the remaining considerations are mere details, which Conservative, Inc. can tweak as desired.

        “They certainly would not have every white woman paired with a black guy.”
So you’ve noticed too?  😉   Seriously however, the real question—which addresses your observation—is why White women/Black man pairing is so much higher than White man/Black women pairing.  Hint: It’s not because of audience ratings.
The miscegenation depicted is solely designed to demoralize “White males” and aimed therefore at the destruction of the White race.  The opposite pairing does not work this way as it is unbelievable and in any event does not strike (psychologically) at the masculinity of the White male patriarchal figure.

                I don’t enjoy most modern movies, but I did enjoy some of the new James Bond movies, with that Craig guy.A few years ago, I decided to treat myself with one of the new Bond movies that I hadn’t seen yet.  The title had “quantum” in it.In the first scene, Bond is being flown around by an ace helicopter pilot who is a sassy black woman.  Later, she is driving a motorcycle with Bond holding on to her.Turned the movie off.  I simply cannot suspend my disbelief or ignore another deliberate attempt to diminish me and my kind.Damn.  Another source of pleasant distraction now dead to me.

                    That was No Time to Die, the most recent Bond film. The character’s name was Nomie and she was played by the hideous–and obnoxious–Lashanna Lynch. The movie itself is not too bad, but the presence of the almighty sheboon degrades it substantially.

                The Web, on unionized female teachers (teaching boys – and soon, judges, lawyers, screenwriters, politicians, bureaucrats, experts, court astrologers, etc.)
“there’s no avoiding this as women will always be women, and Millennial &amp; Gen-Z males have been feminized to the point that they don’t recognize objective truths (Aspergers excepted), instead believing what everyone else in the tribe believes. Hurting of feelings will not be tolerated because deep in their New Millennium feminine souls they believe that what is correct is what the consensus says is correct.”

                Five years ago or so, Google couldn’t get its photo analyzing algorithms to stop categorizing blacks as gorillas.  As far as I know, it remains an unsolved problem.
This resemblance is simply objectively true.  It’s no one’s fault.  But because we’re supposed to pretend we don’t notice or understand, it makes me laugh.
As I’ve gotten more honest with myself about racial issues, I find many black women in particular painful and disgusting to even look at.  I have to turn away.

                    You can find the article over at Unz under author James Thompson.  Thompson is a retired Prof in London.  He often analyses new scientific publications wrt race and IQ.  About a year or so ago, he explained a paper in detail in which skeletal x-rays were classified into one of the 4 main racial categories by AI without (IIRC) a miss!
So much for race being a social construct.

            Quite right. The destruction of white masculinity (“toxic” masculinity) is arguably at the heart of the Left’s anti-white project. If white men are no longer willing to defend themselves, their women and their people, then the white race lies naked before those who seek to annihilate it.

            True enough, but in actuality it is much more common for a black man to be with a white woman than the reverse.  A fat white woman can get a reasonably attractive black man because white is higher valued and they like fat asses anyway.  But not even fat unattractive white men want black women.

            A popular Diss-Right graybeard wrote in a mainstream con outlet like 30 yrs ago that, based on his own informal email correspondence with a few of them, that lovelorn brown sugars seem to “really, really like black men” (paraphrase); with 30% of whom at marriage age having having a criminal record, etc. I don’t think what men of any race want or don’t has much to do with this— that is the story of our species.Paul Krugman used to brag about his black wife (just a for-instance, since we all know someone like that). Now, I’m sure that bit got old even to him eventually, but public jungle fever in the post-Obama collapse era has become nearly exclusively a down-market, womanly/TikTok flex, which industrial advertising then merely copies; and note well that the 2020 Zulu-Floyd Uprising was the spiritual sequel to black women’s rage on behalf of Trayvon the Friendly Neighbor.

        What are the stages of revelation on the road into the DR?First is probably an understanding that the system is fundamentally and comprehensively broken, as manifest in the loss of trust stated in today’s post. Second is likely to be the epiphany that voting harder is a fools errand and we are not going to talk our way out of the mess we’re in. Third could be that we are being led astray by a relatively small number of power-players with nefarious purpose. Has the West ever been more poorly lacking in real leadership as in the present? Fourth may be the hardest to swallow. Collapse is the only real cure. The chaos is necessary to motivate and enable an actual remedy.But the future is still uncertain. The elites are intentionally fostering collapse as a mechanism for instituting tyranny. The DR’s function is to utilize the ensuing fog of chaos as a cloak with which to thwart the tyranny gambit. May the best man win.

        “Experts” and other such media personages are motivated with clear consciences to knowingly lie, because it must be done to support the regime which is the only thing standing between us and the Bad Orange Man. Thus the lying is not only necessary but moral and righteous. For without it, “democracy” could be overthrown, and “fascism” or “nazism,” or worst of all “racism” might triumph. Accompanied by “anti semitism.” And what is a little lie about numbers, or a few extra mail in ballots, compared with all that evil.

        I’d compound the problem in that since money is no longer tied to a commodity thinking about it sinks into abstraction.  Throw in some MMT charlatans and you can’t even convince the average person that there are terrible decisions that are going to be forced at some point in the future.So why don’t people care when you tell them about crushing debt while your government continues to send vast sums of money overseas?  Because they generally fall into two camps:1.  Money doesn’t cost anything2.  The burden won’t fall on meSo it’s not that 30 Trillion isn’t a massive number; it’s that they ascribe no meaning to it or assume that the burden will be minimally impactful at a personal level.

            Just so, Chad. This regime imposing all of this on us has to die. Even if we wanted to save it – it’s doomed. The fixes are incredibly simple, stripped of the Marxist non-math, the fake stats, and the economic oracles.The economy will turn on a dime by– throwing the jews and their fart catchers out of our financial system– tying the currency to gold– restoring meritocracy– maintaining a reasonably fair marketplace and banking system.Vladimir Putin did all that and now the BRICS beat a path to his door. The world will follow. UNLESS we clean up our act. I think it is already too late… we no longer have the human capital that is smart enough to see valid sacrifices today for payoffs tomorrow.If we are to ever save ourselves a lot of people are going to have to be either deported or killed. There are no warm fuzzy solutions left.

        Another wacky take from our host.
Next, he’ll write that Joe Biden isn’t the most popular president ever, Global Warming didn’t render the entire eastern seaboard uninhabitable and Covid didn’t kill me.
My entire unvaxxed family is dead from Covid and I died at least twice, so far as I can remember (although it may have been racism).

            It’s hilarious seeing the left tut-tutting the right on mocking the brutal deaths of progressive idiots after what they made us go through during Covid. The right isn’t listening anymore, which means things are going to get very nasty, very fast.

                    I assume we’re referring to that idiot Ryan Thoreson who got shanked in Bed-Stuy at 4 a.m. by one of his pet negroes. Good riddance. He got exactly what he deserved. My only regret is that he didn’t take the Hutu with him. Two pieces of human refuse in the rubbish bin would have been better than one.

                    And then there was the fudgepacker who was a vocal advocate for the “marginalized”, railed against “white supremacy” and mocked the very accurate perception that Philadelphia is a crime-ridden hellhole. He was murdered in his own Philly apartment and there is rumors that it was related to a drug deal and/or turned trick gone bad, that he didn’t pay for one or the other.

                Chet:  This goes along with Zman’s post about how death has become an abstraction at best, or on the other extreme a nebulous yet pervasive terror.  For most of 2020 I was told I was going to die because of reasons I mocked and ignored, and how awful I was to laugh about the lack of piles of bodies in the streets.  I needed to be sent to a camp for not believing the world had to halt because someone’s 84 year-old grandma with heart disease died from the flu.And now, when I shrug at the death of yet another of their number, I am to be shunned as callous and uncaring.Callous?  I’d rather say I’m hyper focused – in the way Citizen mentioned in a comment on yesterday’s post.  At this point, the only thing I care about (other than my immediate family and few close friends) is the overall well-being of based White people.  If whatever policy or issue or event is good for such Whites, I celebrate.  If it’s not, I’m opposed or, in the other side’s parlance, “callous.”I don’t care that Feinstein (old, sick, and evil) died.  I don’t care that the Puerto ricans and Dominicans in New York don’t like the Hondurans and Guatemalans flooding in.  Car wreck and a bunch of immivaders died?  Meh.  Pregnant jogger shot?  One fewer future predator to deal with.I have never been interested in their circuses and I will provide my own bread.  The numbers are as fake and gay as the liars who promulgate them.  I want all of Clown World to be destroyed. John Donne’s declaration that “Any man’s death diminishes me” was written by a White man about White people – and those who hate themselves and their people have chosen to be excluded from that body.

        Ironically, that lost of trust comes right when the numbers really are starting to matter.The number of white workers is falling fast as a percent of the workforce, replaced by far less competent, conscientious non-whites (and similar young whites). This will make society much less efficient. Brazil is no longer our future but is showing up in patches across the country, and those patches will grow until the old America becomes only patches here and there.The debt and deficits are reaching levels that are stretching the bond market. An estimated $7.5 trillion of current govt debt will rollover in 2024, along with ~$2 trillion in deficit spending for a total of ~$9.5 trillion. That number was ~$5 trillion a few years ago, so ~$4.5 trillion more every year.The global bond market is only ~$135 trillion with ~$35-$45 trillion bonds being rolled over or issued new each year. This means that the bond market needs to absorb an additional $4.5 trillion of US govt debt each year or ~10% of the entire annual bond issuance each year. Where are those buyers going to come from? Even if you do find them, it would mean other bonds (corporate or other govts) wouldn’t get funded.The Boomers are retired now, so they’re starting to take their Social Security. Soon, they’ll be using Medicare much more heavily. Then, they’ll be using Medicaid, which pays for long-term care.A freight train of numbers is coming at the US and the West in general, just as no one trusts the numbers given by our elite. Reality will hit and no one will be in charge.

            On the fence whether financial collapse would be a good or bad thing. On the plus side, it would create an incredible freedom of movement for our side as the money spigot dries up on the NGO and tech network set up to keep us in our pens. The downside is, of course, complete destruction of quality of life for at least a generation and the quite real risk of us losing completely.

                Hard to say how all of this will play out. As long as there’s enough buyers of US gov debt, the plates will keep spinning.But once a country goes over 100% debt to GDP, things usually get messy. Part of it, of course, is the size of the debt, but the other side is that a country has to be poorly led to get in that situation in the first place.A well-managed, united country probably could work its way out of the situation, just as the US did after WWII. I don’t see that happening this time.Also, after WWII when debt to gdp was 120%, we were in much better shape. The big expense – the war – was over and we had a young, well-trained workforce.Now, we’re at 120% and the big expense – entitlements – are just beginning.I don’t when the debt – ours and other countries, along with business and household – will become a real problem, but it’s coming and not a decade or two from now.But, yes, if this sovereign debt crisis plays out like all the rest, i.e., some form of inflating away the debt, it will cause a lot of heartache which should help our cause.

                    Cerebral post as usual.
“A well-managed, united country probably could work its way out of the situation, just as the US did after WWII. I don’t see that happening this time.”
It certainly is not happening.  I would be willing to bet that most “americans” now couldn’t tell you where “government money” even comes from.  Very similar to Z’s comment the other day about how most of the retards amongst us don’t know where food comes from.  “It come from da sto!”.
The shitlibs I know think free stuff comes from “the government”.
We truly are a third world country.

                        Tired Citizen:  I just mentioned to my husband that “most people are too stupid to live.”  There’s an amusing headline at the Daily Mail about what was billed as a tech conference for women having been infiltrated by a large number of male attendees (who all claimed to be transgender).  One early comment was “You wanted this.”Lots of furious and clueless replies.  Not one even mentioned how all the men’s clubs and organizations in decades past were protested and infiltrated and banned by women in the name of equality.  But, of course, simultaneously, women deserved to have ‘their own’ this, that, and the other.  Same with joggers, of course.It truly is astonishing how few people can be bothered to think an issue through and envision the logical consequences.  As I said, too stupid to live.

                    But it may be that convenience alone is the carrying factor.
Let’s say even if the former US balkanizes, informally by state compact or formally á la Yugoslavia…
How is a corn grower in Trashcanistan going to sell his crop to a corn drier facility in Subserbia?  What if the corn drier needs aluminium stock from the Kingdom of Detroy?
How will cross-trade be settled in such turbulence without a standard of convenience?
I’d argue that the dollar, and the nefarious plans attached to it, will continue for a long while.

                    Yes. Moreover, we were the only industrial nation left standing. The 50s and early 60s America crushed because we had no competitors. Then we lent Germany and Japan money and secured the sea lanes. The competition arrived and it seems our, “leadership”, threw in the towel on competing.America First started with the industrial class saying Buy American. The Clouds split with conspicuous consumption of Benzes, Beamers and Lexuses. The transformation of the American homogeny/hegemony on our roads from the early 70s to the mid eighties foreshadowed the demographic transformation. Sadly, the new meat sacks are not in the same class as Germany driving machines.

            I have thought that the media/political attention devoted to “fixing” social security is misdirection from the larger problem of medicare, which is in worse shape and will present problems sooner than ss will.Nobody but nobody wants to address it, because there is no incentive or upside in doing so. You don’t win any votes by saying it’s time to cut medicare.So what will happen, as I have predicted for years now, and I’ll eventually be right, is that Congress, in one of its late night sessions, with no public discussion prior, will suddenly raise the eligibility age. And repeat as needed. Assuming that congress is capable of that level of functionality; I realize that could be a flawed assumption.

                Medicare and Medicaid are a big issue. The biggest issues is that you can’t print your way out of those obligations. You have promised medical services, not dollars. Printing more dollars doesn’t create more doctors, nurses, hospitals, etc.So, yes, there’s only one way out – raise the eligibility age, raise Medicare premiums, increase deductibles, but even all of that won’t change the equation that much. Most elderly don’t have much money. You can’t get blood from a stone.Fine, raise the Medicare age from 65 to 68 or 70. It helps but doesn’t move the needle that much.Our issues is simple. The gov takes in ~17% of GDP historically. Entitlements will be ~15%. Real defense (including benefits to veterans) is ~4%. We are not going to cut defense so it’s basically an entitlement. So, our real entitlements are 19% of GDP – 2% more than revenue.Okay, we start with a structural deficit of 2%. Add in discretionary spending of 3% and you get 5%. Let’s say that nominal GDP growth is around the same number, which is reasonable long-term.That means that the annual growth on the debt is equal to interest on the debt which we haven’t factored in yet. If you have 125% debt to GDP at 5% rates, that’s 6.25% of GDP. That means that debt to GDP rises at ~6 percentage points a year.Good luck with that.So, sure, raise the Medicare age. Maybe that cuts 1% of GDP from the budget. We’re still growing our debt to gdp by ~5 percentage points a year.The types of cuts/tax increases needed are politically unimaginable and would cause a massive recession anyway.We’re at checkmate. Only bad choices left. But as long as the bond market keeps buying the debt, the game will go on.

                    We need to end the empire. The DOD got 1.8t trillion Dollars in 2023.  It is the empire that bankrupted the US, not entitlements.  Had we not blew the huge surpluses SS generated from its inception until a few years ago, it would be perfectly solvent. The US government would have more than enough in savingsDuring the 100% fake budget surpluses (we have not run a surplus since the early 60s) around the turn of the century, Bush went and created the prescription part of medicare, making the problem far worse. It wouldn’t surprise me if prescription medicine prices started ballooning the second the ink was dry on that bill.GDP is so distorted we really can’t even look at the budgets through the lens of GDP. 50 plus years of lying about inflation is compounded into the GDP. (if the deflator is too low, it doesn’t scrub inflation out of the GDP). Man do we ever lie about inflation!  And, of course, government spending is counted in GDP.  So when some Indian thief cheats Medicare out of a few million Dollars, our GDP goes up by those few million Dollars. If he blows those few million, they get counted again.It’s all fake and gay, like everything else in AINO.

I am a civil engineer and I am surrounded by “Planners”, “Environmental Specialists”, and “Project Coordinators” that are all women. I’d be willing to accept having them in the workforce if they did nothing, but they don’t, they get in way. Just this past Monday they called an office wide meeting with a giant poster board in the front of the room and everyone got different colored sticky notes to post what you’re doing and any “concerns” you have. Being one of the few with the necessary, for now, licenses necessary to keep the lights on I left the meeting immediately and got back to work.

Not that I think this will work, but the Fed Res will buy those Treasury securities—unless the merge both together.  At that point, there can be no hiding the fact and the currency collapses.

            Social Security is a relatively easy fix with means testing, eliminating the income cap and raising the retirement age for people under 40.  I am not advocating these, but just doing the math.  Medicare on the other hand, is an unsolvable issue without severe rationing.

                It’s an easy fix, you are correct.  But even better, it needs no fixing (since our government can’t get together to fix anything these days).  SSI simply goes “broke” and distributes all incoming funds minus shortfall.  Currently estimated at about a 25% haircut across the board for every recipient.  This is a matter of current law and needs no enactment.
Ouch, but it would be more honest than simply turning up the money printing presses.

        The GDP fetish is the prime example of this bogus “Numbers” phenomenon:1) Borrow money from China, spend it in Ukraine creating shell craters and magically, US GDP goes up. (Poor Simon Kuznets, the father of GDP/national income accounting, is rolling in his grave). War is the perfect, classic example of unproductive spending.2) Borrow money from China, give it to LaQueesha for AFDC, she spends the money on Cheetos at Wawa, and GDP goes up.3) Julio and Lupita cross the border, get $15/hr jobs off the books, get welfare on the books, send 1/3 of their “paycheck” (usually cash on the down-low) back to Mexico, but GDP has gone up!! The remittances to Mexico aren’t captured in GDP, but the Corona drunk and the welfare consumed is!! Julio’s sheetrock company reports higher sales (included in GDP), but not his presence on the payroll, so it looks like US productivity is going up too haha.I could go on. It’s a Fugazy. We have no idea what’s really happening. I assume people have almost enough money, or there would be even more riots. We will find out eventually the true state of affairs.

            GDP is a dumb way of keeping track of economic income.  GDP is loaded up with all kinds of fake stuff in addition to the stuff you listed.  Things like homeowner’s rent, free bank accounts, free google accounts etc.  Blowing money on hookers and blow is given the same weight as someone buying their trade’s tools.  The GDP deflator is too low and so a decent portion of “GDP growth” is just inflation. And it compounds.  Somehow, despite near constant GDP growth in the 21st century, everyone has gotten poorer.

            Those are great examples. And while we’re at it, let’s consider that about 17% of the GDP represents healthcare spending, which is hitting white working people the hardest.
Illegals and welfare recipients get greatly subsidized care, while heritage Americans are struggling to pay for mediocre insurance. These days, it’s not uncommon for working families to pay over $20,000 a year just for insurance premiums. And that’s before a single doctor visit or procedure. This does not include dental.
But hey, it’s all part of the GDP, so yee-ha.

        Besides the general corruption of the data, the era of numbers came to an end due to:1. The culture becoming feminized. Numbers are male. Feelings are female. If it feels right, it is right.2. Social media. To have any impact numbers have to be analyzed and reflected upon. Likes and trends on social media are better driven by emotionally impactful memes and taking points that enable you to demonstrate that you are a good smart person by liking them and getting liked (also very female).3. The only numbers that matter to our replacements are related directly their personal finances and the number of their family they can bring to America. Issues like budget deficits and other sacred numbers of Con Inc only matter to white people.

        “A line of people with impressive sounding credentials provided the math of this claim.”It’s funny because a 3rd grader could show the same thing using basic arithmetic. Using the metric of GDP, the government can always increase the economy by spending more money.  It could expand the economy by digging holes on Monday, Wednesday and Friday and filling them in on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday and even pay OT for the Saturday fill ins. It is equally obvious that the feds spending a Dollar will ultimately generate more than a Dollar in “economic activity” where GDP is how it is measured.

        I worked in corporate finance for many years. Retired now. First, it was net income. Then EBITDA became important as if a company didn’t really have to pay interest or taxes. Then it became things like EBITDAR (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and restructuring costs). After awhile, companies would throw all sorts of expenses into a formula to come up with a number to show that without all these expenses, the company and its management were actually doing well and the bank should lend them money. Things became so clouded that it wasn’t easy to sift through all the garbage. I know, cool story bro.

            Since you retired, we invented “adjusted” EBITDAR and also “adjusted” EPS (removing stock-based compensation) for public companies. I spend fully 10% of my time trying to make my younger team members aware of all the tricks.

                Numbers lads, when I used to think like a normal person, I found banking and accounting fascinating.
I’ve just started this long piece from WRSA; I hate to ask, but I think you fellas might find this a wee bit interesting.
It’s on “The Great Taking” beginning in the Dubya-9/11 years.

                    It is more than interesting. I took the time to read the entire piece (except for the appendix, from whose contents the author selected relevant passages for inclusion in the main body of the text).The author certainly had all of the relevant knowledge and high level experiences to have reached the conclusions that he does in the end. A lot of the details are beyond my experience, but I could certainly unhesitatingly credit the validity of his argument despite this shortcoming on my part, so clear as it was to me in the recounting even so.While much of the ground covered does stem from “W’s” years in office, it only attains full impact through his fairly frequent references and remembrances to circumstances having their origin all the way back to the Great Depression, and actually even from before that era.He is a man of susbstance, from a family line of substantial people, details of which he treats of at some length because those anecdotes are relevant to the formation of his character, and the depth of personally experienced cultural history from which his argument is, in no small part, derived.You beat me to this, Alzaebo; I was intending to drop this link here, as I thought it of real significance in identifying where we all currently find ourselves, as well as how we got here.Do invest the time to read it, friends. The conclusions are very sobering.

        &gt; When some new personality bursts on the scene claiming to have a huge audience, but no one you know heard of the guy until last weekLex Friedman is the most gratuitous example I’ve ever seen. All of the sudden every media outlet was in lockstep promoting the guy. When he posted the 50 books he was going to read, which were all staples of the Western Canon, my eyes rolled to the back of my head. It isn’t that the books are bad, but you can always tell a mass produced guy by his intellectual interests, which are always as bland and inoffensive as possible.The other obvious example, Shapiro, was always a production, and I’m convinced his job is to grab already established people under his umbrella to keep them in line.

                    Well, he is a glib summarizer who resembles nothing so much as the New, Edgy David Brooks, therefore always will come across 10%-90% cute-loathesome. That makes him seem like a plant, even if it is really the organic opinionating voice meeting market demand.
He’s probably an inferior writing stylist to Brooks (who wasn’t exactly Montaigne) but to be fair I’ve not seen any non-polemical sample that didn’t slop out as a “stack.”

                Isn’t he actually not associated with MIT other than having given a lecturer(s) there before?  As in not an actual prof or researcher for them?  That the MIT aspect of things is just marketing/ personal astroturf.
I could be mistaken but I recall hearing that somewhere.

                He gets interviews with top-level scientists and mathematicians: a more interesting guest list than any major TV shows I’m aware of.   I listen to his podcast for that reason.  I have to say though while he’s certainly not a  *worse* interviewer than a Charlie Rose or, worse, some bimbo, but he’s not tremendously better.  Given the level of guests he brings on, and his supposed MIT computer science background, I would expect better questions.  I guess the question I have is why Lex Fridman is the only guy out there getting these tremendous interviews, and nobody else.  Nothing against the guy but there’s nothing special about him either.

            There are levels to every midwit exit ramp. For people whom we commonly call conservatives, there’slevel 1: Fox News. I call this the Normie Right.For the ones that think Fox is fake news, there’slevel 2: pat-con channels like NewsMax or those channels on YouTube where burly guys with flags do the pat-con thing. Lots of Irish in this bucket. I call this the Irish Right.For people who fancy themselves Thinkers and open-minded outside-the-box right-of-center types, there’s the gatekeepers of the online right, orlevel 3: Shapiro, Crowder, Fridman, Walsh, Candace O, and all the way down to Lotus Eaters and Chris Rufo and Hannania. I call this the J*wish Right.Thenlevel 4which is the dissident right which you have to, by luck or intelligence or willingness, to pass through the top three levels to get here. Most people will stop at their level of intellectual curiosity. And level three is very good at making people feel good that they’re having a Big Think about things, and therefore won’t travel on to level 4 where the hugs and assurances are few.

                I think level 4 also has a defining aspect—biological reality, or “Race Realism”.  A subject that is taboo, ignored, suppressed up to and including level 3.  But I admit, HBD science is my hobby horse so I’ll burden you no longer.

                    The last divide is right there.
Does the forbidden/obvious tell you that the present order is correct except for its behaving as if in ignorance of “HBD,” and a properly informed, rhetorically honest, biological-realist reform program could repair its faults? You’re with Sailer, Spencer et al. Hierarchy, because desirable, is presumed innocent/correct. Its errors are *errors*. Taylor Lorenz rules you by right.
Or—
Does the forbidden/obvious tell you that the extant hierarchy is wholly deranged from top to bottom—in purpose and personnel, down to the last tranny meter maid?

        “There is a bigger issue that applies to all the numbers. Decades of lying about the numbers have made all of them suspect. The totally fake economic data pumped out in the Obama years sunk the credibility of the court wizards.”It started with Clinton. That scumbag changed the way inflation was calculated, partly to stiff social security recipients who receive a cost of living adjustment that is tied to the official inflation number (consumer price index). The GDP figures are even more untethered from any sort of reality, and likewise for “growth.” People with solemn faces keep talking about the Chinese economy overtaking the US economy in the 2020s (or 2030s or 2040s, I lose track). No, you sh!theads, the Chinese economy shot past the US maybe around 2010 or 2011 (I say “maybe” because accurate figures just aren’t available).In the economic sphere we don’t have credible numbers because we don’t have sound money. Money is created ex nihilo. The US economy is all smoke and mirrors. We do notice in a tangible way that our money buys less, that we have more trouble making ends meet, buying staples, putting food on the table. Some of us do sense the fakery of it all and we buy land, we buy guns, we buy MREs and water-purifying tablets, maybe some junk silver because we don’t trust the sustainability of this fake system.  The US empire is going the way of the Valyrian and Ghiscari empires.

                I think the worst of Clinton but really that rework of inflation was inevitable after everything was set to auto-increase to inflation.  It wouldn’t have mattered who was president (note that, if anything, the calcs for inflation and unemployment got worse under W. Bush).

        They lie, we know they lie, they know we know they lie, and they lie anyway. The republic form of government we had could not survive in a low-trust society and is now gone. What foul beast crawling from the swamp will take its place remains to be seen, but I’m betting it’s not one where individual rights and liberty are considered unalienable.
What’s really disturbing is none of what I said is an original thought. Our epitaph may well be: “they knew, and did it anyway”.

        Sounds like life in the Soviet Union. Apathy with an extremely jaded view of life seems to be the only way to navigate. Everything in government or media that is thrown in my face I react with extreme skepticism or disgust.Paid shills in the media with ratings that seem like they come from public access tv are promoted to worthy spokespeople. Maybe that’s where they want us. Still, given an opportunity to blow back or publicly counter them if the opportunity arrises is still there. Small rebellions is all that is left for now and we should take advantage of it. Mark Dice live pranking about Tucker on Fox the other night is a good example.Obviously something major has to give and we can see the raping of America and it’s finances is hastening our decline along with the implemented cultural rot. Even though voting and electoral politics is not useful anymore I still welcome a million more Kevin McCarthy moments.

            Every month the unemployment report comes out and says the economy is still surging. This report consistently defies the private company data (which in the past it correlated strongly to) and analyst estimates. Same with the GDP numbers. We hear then from the usual media outlets about how we are too stupid for not accepting the genius of Bidenomics. Then every quarter, without fail, those numbers get quietly revised down. The revisions are reported about 1/1000th as much, and nobody wonders about the probability of these numbers being revised down every single time. You’d expect some revisions up and some down, but not constantly down or constantly up. So now we are at the point where the numbers are fake, we know they are fake, they know they are fake, and they know that we know they are fake, but they still do it. There are lots of examples but if this was the monthly boot or wheat production numbers or something, it’s a dead ringer for the USSR.

                I suspect the ballyhooed employment statistics are geared to facilitate the argument more immigrants are needed to fill jobs and to keep devaluing the dollar. There may be a secret stash of magic money to keep people home and unemployed but so far evidence of it has not emerged.

                Usually follow the double rule with government – e.g, if official report says 7% inflation,  real inflation is probably closer to 14% if not worse.

        The history of the 20th century is that elites used “science” as a way to control us. “The science” says that there is no God, we all just became something when nothing blew up a long time ago, so don’t you feel a little dumb going to church every Sunday and abiding by their rules? Likewise, they turned economics into a “science”, even inventing a fake Nobel Prize for the discipline, showing how absolutely important it was that they establish its import. Then they awarded the fake Nobel to the economists who said that we need globalization, open borders, low wages, low taxes on the rich, supremely powerful bankers, fiat currency that gets endlessly debased (in a “controlled” way though), low interest rates, etc. Yea, it’s exactly all the stuff that the oligarchs benefit most from, but that is irrelevant – this is SCIENCE. This is objective reality.Well, of course not,  economics is best understood as a branch of philosophy, ethics, and political science, in that it is about the best way of organizing a society. It won’t be treated as such until we are released from the tyrannical hold that science has had over us.

            Not for nothing is economics called the dismal science. Personally, I pay it no nevermind.

            If you want to see a progressive stutter and then go quiet, the next time he says climate change or vaccines or whatever are based on science, drill into where they got their science.  What scientists or studies did you review?  Are there any dissenting scientists?  The response will be some gibberish about the consensus.  But where did you learn of this consensus and who does it include?  It always comes back to some liberal news outlet quoting government sponsored scientists and ignoring dissent, which then becomes a talking point.Yes, I know this does no good, and the progressive never learns, but it is good party fun.
