        Suddenly, the gears of the state stop spinning and no one who knew how to make them spin was available to get them spinning.
In our case would this be at the State level as well, or is this just the Federal?

        I’ve never understood this “deep state” business either.  I know Sailer has a bug up his ass about it — well, that and the Jooos! — and that seems to be why a lot of folks take it seriously, but to me it just seems like an esoteric term for “how business gets done in the real world.”Back in the days, they called the “deep state” the “court faction” — everybody knew that you could get the king’s ear most effectively by talking to an obscure country prelate with no real title to speak of, but who somehow lived in a mansion “donated” by a disgraced Earl.  It’s why the nouveau riche always sent their kids to Oxford and Cambridge (or Harvard and Yale) even though their degree, should they bother taking one, would be in “divinity” or some such.Kinda obvious, but jargon just sounds so cool — “getting inside the enemy’s OODA loop” instead of “taking initiative” or plain ol’ “attacking.”

Court faction? Where I saw this before?
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_Jew
“In the early modern period, a court Jew or court factor (German: Hofjude, Hoffaktor) was a Jewish banker who handled the finances of, or lent money to, European royalty and nobility. In return for their services, court Jews gained social privileges, including in some cases being granted noble status. Court Jews were needed because usury did not apply to them, whereas it did to Christians.”
