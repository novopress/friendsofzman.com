        It’s funny that you say Michelle Malkin isn’t smart because she is a republican  like presumably you are. What about her makes her unintelligent? Is it a tendency to oversimplify complicated issues?

            I’m not a Republican. I’m not a conservative, as popularly defined. I don’t vote, as I think it is a waste of my time. As for Malkin, she is on TV because of her looks, not because she is a deep thinker. Her act consists of saying bad things about lefty pols and chanting magic phases like “crony capitalism.” I wish no harm on Malkin as I think he heart is in the right place. Her blind loyalty to party and whatever gets defined as “conservative” is what I find off-putting. People like her were all in favor of invade the world-invite the world when Bush was peddling it. Now that Obama is peddling it, they oppose it.
