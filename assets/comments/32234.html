        If Trump Were Smart, he’d announce he is choosing a literal Dirt Person, a white working class man in his late 30s like a carpenter or truck driver, with a quiet wife and normal children, not some Evangelical Christian lunatic, not a scumbag politician, not some lapdog general, and not some girlboss. That would probably frighten the Regime and Vichy even more than the Bad Orange Man himself, because it would force them to deal with a normal human, and it would be an indelible symbol and rallying point for White America, a propaganda gold mine for a real movement beyond Trump.

            Remember “Joe the Plumber”, the white guy who asked Obama an uncomfortable question on 2008?His life wasn’t ruined at all and he lived a long, healthy life after that.

            Pickle Rick hit on something that Tucker and Sailer both gloss over.  The people who read/watch both these guys are vastly more political compared to the real target of the Establishment. In other words, no one is picking on the white Mitt Romneys or Liz Warrens or even the Tuckers of the country – the establishment’s hatred is way more narrowly targeted at the white working class.Unfortunately, the white working class is too busy trying to keep dinner on the table to dabble in ideas.  These are the people Trump reaches.  To put it into left-speak, these people “matter” most, not only because they are of the founding stock, but because they actually function largely outside the burgeoning bureaucracy/management class and its fake and gay progressive police state.  Modernity has degraded them more than most demographics because they are literally sitting ducks.  Their growing suicide and death rate reflect this.Imagine if Trump took the Hispanic box off the Census. That would accelerate future festivities by a full decade, overnight.

        Best meme I’ve seen of Vivek vs “Nikki”:
”Two Indians arguing about how much money we need to send to Israel”.
If Biden’s choice of Kamala for VP proved anything, it’s that VPs don’t matter in the slightest. Neither do presidents.

            One of the funniest videos I’ve ever seen was when someone replaced the debate audio with two Indian drivers screaming at each other

            If Biden’s choice of Kamala for VP proved anything, it’s that VPs don’t matter in the slightest. Neither do presidents.Anyone who believes elected officials have any power at all now is stupid or delusional. The whole point of “Biden,” whether the Regime intended so or not, was to emphasize the president is a powerless figurehead of the Ruling Class. It is why I smile any time someone suggests Obama, the ultimate Step ‘N Fetchit of the oligarchs, now is in control, something that wasn’t true during his eight-year performance, either. Trump unexpectedly won and that terrified the Ruling Class, which promptly neutered him (not that it took much).Americans have no more input into public policy than Russians.

                But, but muh constitution, muh bill of rights!  Lol.  You’re exactly right, it is a sad state of affairs.  I always get a laugh out of an article claiming fjb made such and such a proposal or is taking this executive action, etc.  Anyone who believes that, especially with this senile pervert is an absolute flipping idiot.

                For people who claim that “Biden did this” or “Bush did that”, I try and invoke a mental exercise: let’s say you, normie, decide here and now that you are going to be president one day. Now imagine what you have to do for this to succeed. You’re going to have to raise money, first and foremost, and play nice with certain figures in the establishment. That is the base requirement. If you don’t do these two simple things, you get ignored at best, professionally or financially ruined at worst.Then imagine you want to go higher. Now you start meeting people with terrifying political or financial power. Maybe people that have had people killed. Immoral people. Do you start telling them that the American Empire is evil? Do you even dare criticize the thing that has given them riches and power?Let’s say you not only want to be higher, but want to be afigurehead. This is when you are not only vetted and compromised to every atom of your body by now, but there are extra safeguards against you finding your principles or morality. Persuasion isn’t enough at this level. There are kill switches. There are now people, foreign and domestic, waiting to kill you or ruin you, lest you don’t read the script handed to you or say yes to the right people.Still think this Republic can be saved by a good man in office?

                Yeah, the “Obama is running things behind the scenes” talk is hilarious. Even when he was president, Barry was a lazy actor who’d rather spend his time on the golf course followed a trip to the bath house than get involved with talking his producers and directors about the script.
Even a fired-up Trump wouldn’t put a dent in the Uniparty, and Trump, oddly given everything that’s being thrown against him, seems to be going through the motions this time.

                    It’s a good point. I think Obama was a useful symbol for the people who were actually in charge, he got VERY highly paid to be that symbol, and I think he still is, and he seems to enjoy still acting as that symbol. Is he making decisions or is actually in charge, of course not, but he’s still acting in largely the same role he was when he occupied the WH. Unlike Bush who slinked away in shame and disappeared for a solid decade, Obama maintained a house in DC and is put in front of the camera whenever the PTB want to put a message out there.Trump’s primary mistake was thinking the government is like one of his companies, where he is the President, he makes decisions, it is the job of people under him to carry out those decisions.

                        Important for the left and the rest of the world to believe that someone competent is in charge.
I think Barry thinks he’s running a shadow presidency.

A Democrat candidate may be running for months for office, but in the last couple weeks, I’m wholly convinced a ton of voters are voting for Abortion(tm) rather than the empty suit:All hail ¡The Current Thing! until the NEXT Current Thing software patch!

                            Nope. That’s one of the strengths of our sacred democracy. We don’t know who is actually in charge. Maybe the most visible glimpse we got was during the Trump admin when a literal Sanhedrin in New York City would be on mute during important phone calls from the Oval Office.

                    Another factor, generally overlooked (especiallyby conservatives who can easily calculate the IQ of the son of a Kenyan politician and an American honeypot): Obama is very, very dumb.
As a fifty year old man, his favorite tv show was Entourage. He’s a basketball fan who can’t spell Syracuse. He was the president who “normalized” visible teleprompters—and using them, he mispronouncedevery wordthat was even slightly uncommon (“corpsman” most famously). Etc.
He can’t even run his mouth.

                Best insight yet. One that needs to be heard more in “Normie” media discussion. Only major presentation I heard discussing such was the Tucker interview with Putin—and a damn foreign leader had to express it.  In a sane USA, this would have made headlines. In the clown world we live in, not a peep. Why? Well, read Jack’s OP.

                Trump being Trump, he will probably make a dumb pick, or at least pick someone who doesn’t take any of the spotlight away from him and his monstrous ego.I’d say Youngkin because he is bland and demure and from a swing state but who knows?It really doesn’t matter  much anyhow… there’s simply no way the Ruling Class will allow Trump to win again, even assuming that he will get enough votes to do so.Right-wingers blithely assume that Biden is toast, but I’m not so sure. Spend some time among some Blue-state shitlibs. They’re not voting for Trump. They’ll vote for Biden even if he’s in a coma in a nursing home. Their grift depends upon the Democrats being in control, they know damn well Bidden is a puppet and they’re good with that.The only Biden constituency I see potentially defecting is the Arab and Muslim groups upset by the unconditional support for the Gaza slaughter, but Trump is also a Zionist bootlicker so it’s not as if he gives them any alternative.

        The stuff Trump has been saying lately – endless support for Israel’s genocide, promising “Nikki” Haley a job in his administration, staple green cards to diplomas – tells me that he is trying to kill off the populist rebellion, that Trump is killing Trumpism. He probably made some deals to stay out of prison. To that end, maybe his strategy will be the reverse of what we have thought – instead of picking someone to signal to the regime, he will pick someone to signal to his base.That said, ultimately, it won’t change much. The fire he lit when he went down the escalator hasn’t gone out and the empire is not going to stop collapsing because he decides to play ball with it. The populist rebellion won’t just dissipate because Trump governs like Mitt Romney in his second term. The only way out is through.

            I think he got a taste for power during the first term. Not the same power as running a property empire, but of the ultimate power that (supposedly) goes with being POTUS. He’s done a deal with the powers behind the curtain: give me that “power” back and I’ll say and do anything you want.

                You and Bruno are both right. Granted, the wellspring of anger is very real and it isn’t going anywhere. That said, without a charismatic figure such as Trump to give it voice, that anger will shout itself hoarse in the wilderness. The question is, is there another Big Man out there over yon horizon to receive the MAGA mantle from BoM? Possibly. But I don’t have a clue as to who it might be.

        Like so many, I can’t muster any emotion about this election. It’s become clear that we’ve passed some point. The donor control seems complete. Even the college protests (manned by people who hate us too) were put down with authority. They won’t be happening again.I used to think that Trump winning would be a fun poke in the eye to the system even if he couldn’t do anything, but, now, even that seems pointless. I’m not being black-pilled, just realistic. Indeed, I’m optimistic. Just as the Kosher Uniparty has solidified its control, the system is showing major cracks.True, we can’t reform or fix the system. But the system that hates and oppresses us is falling apart and will have a harder time functioning (and thus oppressing us) as time goes on.

            At least in the US elections there is still a chance that Trump will win and MAYBE do a few good things. In the UK, unless Farage finally gets his act together, there is even less blue water between the “opposing parties”. The choice is more massive illegal immigration of more illegal massive immigration.

        At this point in time I have accepted these facts: Someday we will be wiping our asses on Hundred Dollar bills as a side effect of America’s very own Soviet Union level extinction event. Also you had better have plenty of arms and ammunition, for the ballot box and jury box will be replaced by the bullet box.
I don’t see how our future can be much different. On the other hand, it would be a wonderful day when the lawyers and judges are afraid of the bullet box and the very act of showing their faces in public.

The fall of the Soviet Union was the best case scenario.  If the American empire collapsed, I don’t think it would be so orderly.  It was kind of a unique event in modern history.

                Correct. The way Putin brought Russia back from the post-Soviet hellscape to where it is today is one of the greatest feats in modern history. We won’t be so lucky. The Russians, despite 70 years of communist evil, still share a common history and values, while Christianity came out stronger because of the oppression. We no longer have any of those. The best case scenario is some kind of split along ideological lines. However, that might not work either, and probably will involve serious violence.

            I don’t think we will live to see the bullet box.  I hope so, but unlikely.  I tell like minded folks to wake me up when the shooting starts.  That’s the only thing that will change anything.  Everything else is merely theater to placate the plebs.  Normie eats it up too, still thinking that Trump will get elected and fix it all.

        I had money down on Kristi Noem from way back, but then she did that thing. If you’re short of quick hits for the Q&amp;A, what are your thoughts on that? When it first came out that she shot her dog, I thought “She’s gotten a good talking-to from the Uniparty, and has decided to remove herself from consideration.” But upon further review… well, that’s exactly the kind of thing a chick who has been in the apple-polisher pipeline all her life would think makes her sound “tough” to icky Red Staters, right? I mean, isn’t that what you people do, out there in the boondocks? Jeff Foxworthy or somebody said “That dog just ain’t gonna hunt,” and all you rednecks have lots of guns, so…

            Just for the record: I’m sure exactly zero of thatactuallyhappened. I doubt she ever even had a dog, much less shot it herself, or even ordered it shot. It’s just something she thought would make her sound tough, so she had her ghostwriter put it in the book. But that’s the official public claim, anyway, or at least was, until the utterly predictable to anyone other than a Cloud Person outcome: That she killed her dog because it was dangerous and failed its hunting training.

                Noem’s dog story happened. She is a rarity in politics in that she did actual work in her family’s ranch and other businesses before entering politics. You are right in that her reason for including it was to make her sound tough to voters and she was completely tone deaf to how it was going to go over with them. I don’t think she was ever under serious consideration despite her affair with Trump advisor Corey Lewendowski.  National interest in Noem died off quickly after Covid and being from a small state Trump will win easily does nothing for him.

                        Noem has also gone through so much plastic surgery on her face she looks ghoulish.  From her start as Governor in 2019 she doesn’t even look like the same person.  I think her political career is over after this unless Trump wins and gives her a job.  Doubt she will ever be elected to another office in South Dakota.

                            I’ve made a similar comment on other pages that she isn’t aging well. Like Sarah Palin, she may be past peak hotness. Sarah, at least, used to hit it out of the park whenever she said something (and also her opinion pieces). I don’t get that Kristi has the same ability.

            White people have an unhealthy love of dogs, so methinks the new sexual harassment/racism charge is the animal-abuse charge.
If you can’t convince people that you mistreated a lady or did a racism, you could maybe convince them that you were a terrible dog mom.

            I also thought that it’d be Noem. Trump would love to trot out a reasonably hot chick as his VP. She’d say MAGA things and then stand aside. She’s literally Sarah Palin 2.0. (I’m sure that she absolutely loves Israel as well.) But she (or, really, her handlers) screwed up.
But it doesn’t matter. Hell, Trump doesn’t matter.

                Trump matters only to the extent he behaves like a free radical who destabilizes the power structure. Despite all his tough talk, he didn’t do this when he had the chance, and I doubt he’ll do it if he gets a second chance.

                You know, if she let her herself get bedded by somebody with a little class, I might not be as harsh as I’m being on her. But to let herself get bedded by some scumbag like Corey Lewandowski? I have no respect for her. It gives me the creeps just thinking about it.

            I don’t care about the dog. They put down rabid dogs in the local gas chamber every day. What I care about is that she was enough of a cheeseball to let some political creep like Corey Lewandowski in her pants. And even if nothing happened, which I highly doubt after reading the accounts, the fact that she wasn’t smart enough to keep someone like him at arm’s length so that people wouldn’t talk proves that she’s a moron.

            The dog thing was very ugly, as a press event, but she’d removed herself from MAGA types’ consideration long before. Her state’s legislature passed the first mild tranny resistance bill, her corporate masters told her to veto it—trannies are more valuable to “business” than they areto trannies—and she did. Republicans who keep up with the news turned against her instantly and forever.I think Noem’s dog story isn’t about Noem, but part of the GOP’s “Shapiro Strategy.” No amount of establishment rage/persecution/lies can make Trump unpopular, so it’s up toother Republicansto remind voters that Republicans are repulsive assholes and ruin their electoral chances. Vivek’s job is to call us racists, Senators are threatening to end social security, the reddest governors are banning hate speech, Trump’s most prominent SC appointee wrote today’s pro-censorship decision (maybe the most unlawful SC decision of all time), etc. Republicans are running a Zero Seats campaign against themselves.Vance and the Arizona lady are the only VP hopefuls who haven’t joined it, so they’re Trump’s only two symbolically legitimate choices (though Vance might be the lowest piece of shit alive and the girl is retarded).

                    The question for us to ask about any Black VP choice, is what will he/she do if/when she/he ascends to the Presidency—either through election or death?  WRT Z-man’s opinion, I believe a Black VP—other than the moron we currently have—is a very elevated step to further office.  Ben Carson is *not* a moron, he’s a nice guy, but he’s never had political power.  I simply do not trust Blacks with power over Whites—just as I don’t play “Russian Roulette”, nor recommend others do.
I fear the public has learned nothing from the Obama fiasco.

                        The trouble Trump has is that nobody in the Republican Party is particularly likeable these days. Ben Carson is one of the few I can think of that is universally liked.I’m a die-hard Trumpist, early adopter on the Trump train, since August, 2015. If some Pajeet is his running mate, I’m withholding my vote. I’d be okay with Ben Carson though.It seems like all of Somalia, Bhutan and other places like that have been dumped into my area. That all happened under Zero, with Republicans sitting on their hands. Neither party can or wants to do anything about our immigration situation. They all drink the kool-aid.

                200% voter turnout would be a great thing. It would finally reveal, even to the the biggest grillers and urban soy connoisseurs, that the system is totally corrupt. We would finally enter the despair phase, slowly turning into apathy (I doubt anybody would actually use their guns).

            I’m rooting for Baron. Tall, absolute Chad physgionomy, apparently quite smart, he lived in the White House and saw first hand what these creatures have done to his father. There’s a few hints of Augustus here.

                            You know, considering how dumb a lot of us were about things when we weren’t as seasoned as we are now, I don’t know if old is such a bad thing. I think you need to have lived through things, and have things that you believed in and sounded logical at the time exposed as being BS to have the right touch to be a leader.How many of us were pro Israel? How many of us thought free trade was a good idea? (I did, though I thought unilateral free trade was stupid.) How many of us bought into the markets not being rigged? For that matter, how many of us bought into the idea that sports ball wasn’t rigged? Russia? I’ve done a 180 on abortion, Israel and a whole host of issues. How many of us understood how elected officials are just puppets these days and why?That comes through seasoning, living life, and experiencing reality being different from the stuff they teach you.

                                Yeah, but now we have a face-off between an 81 year old and a 78 year old. One keeps forgetting to go to the toilet before he starts pushing and the other one is still lucid but very out of touch with the electorate.
Even if Trump were a perfect candidate otherwise, his age would prevent him from making any durable impact. He was too old in 2016.Ideal age would be late 40’s / early 50’s with the ability to start some sort of a dynasty/hereditary rule.

            Sailer’s rise over the past six months or so is very interesting. Why has a guy who has been kept in the corner of the punditry dinner party – but, importantly, never kicked out – being allowed a seat at the table? It’s not an accident.Completely wild guess here, but I suspect that it has something to do with Oct. 7. Yes, Sailer talks about racial differences (similar to Charles Murray), but Sailer is also a diehard civic nationalist and, while he chides Jews for not having more noblesse oblige toward their goy peasants, he never questions their rule or even their right to rule. (They’re just so smart, after all.)I’m guessing that our rulers are trying to change the narrative because they’re worried that they can’t avoid getting lumped into Team Whitey. Moving to a Sailer narrative – yes, they’re are racial differences but we need to treat everyone as an individual – allows Jews to stay on top. After all, they’re just so darn smart.

            Tucker exposing Steve Sailer to a mass audience will only have the effect of demonstrating to all and sundry that Steve is a kook and an idiot. This will accelerate when people learn that Steve is a pro-vax Kovid Karen and a rabid Ukrainiac—two regime-friendly policies which Tucker’s audience doesn’t much cotton to, and which Tucker himself has done a lot of legwork opposing.And, since Steve is the public face of HBD, this will bring the death knell to that particular piece of pseudoscientific nonsense, and good riddance to it. Steve Sailer is about to be destroyed by finally having to confront actually intelligent people, not just MSM clowns that he can needle with his irksome tweets or disfavored commenters that he can “whim.”

As stated before, Sailor is not a big deal in the field, as in nothing. Sailor is a commentator, not a producer of the science.  Sailor is only a big deal in the small mind of ID.As the adage goes, “The dogs bark, but the caravan moves on.”  So it does with ID and his rants.

Here we have somebody like yourself, a respectable member of the DR, just casually tossing it out that Steve Sailer is a nobody.I completely agree with that, of course, but it’s strange that up until recently, this would have been considered absolute heresy on the Dissident Right. I’ve been getting beaten up at the Unz Review for the last 9 years for saying exactly the same thing, and there we still have commenters who will tell you—literally and with a straight face—that Steve Sailer is the most important intellectual of the 21st Century. The fact that you would call him a nobody, and be repeatedly upvoted for it at a DR site, is a very big deal. A very positive development, in fact.You’ll notice the Z-Man hasn’t even mentioned the word “biology” for a couple of months, nor said much about HBD whatsoever. I believe that is significant. I think Z-Man is slowly coming around to the position that HBD is overblown, that the world is richer and deeper and that there are better paradigms than that for explaining what is going on. That’s because Z-Man, unlike Sailer and the Sailerites, is not actually an idiot. He is actually a smart person, if somewhat deranged. He is figuring out the truth and I hope he takes you with him when he gets there.

                        Sailor is a legend in your (ID) own mind.  Not in anyone else’s that I know about.  Yet you continue to conflate him with someone who is authoritative in the HBD science field and therefore “speaks for it”.  That is your problem.I couldn’t care less whether you disagree with Sailor on any of his musings, I simply cannot accept that you denounce HBD science and *use* Sailor as your proof that it is pseudoscience.  This is a fallacy of reason.  For a person who pretends to be an “intellectual” among us “wannabes”, this is quite telling.You have a problem with Sailor, fine.  You want to talk about HBD science, fine.  Just don’t conflate the two.  You are flamed not because I disagree with you.  I do not flame folks I disagree with specifically because I disagree with them—nor down vote disagreements.  Whatever your downvote tally, not a single one has been from me.You are flamed because you are too obtuse to understand the fallacy of reason you continue to present in this forum.  This must be more than just my opinion—if one pays attention to the typical downvoting of your comments—which of course you do not.ID, you simply don’t belong here—or anywhere.  You contribute little more than disruption to most any topic of discussion.  You do not persuade, you annoy.  Of course, that is your purpose, whether you realize this or not.  It is your oxygen, the very air your breath.  It proves you are alive, that you have purpose.  It says “look at me”.  I know your type.You can’t gain any recognition for persuasive thought in any forum you post too.  Your posts are easily gathered. I’ve read your postings. No one follows you.  You are also a failed blogger, so you follow in the path of others, your betters, such as Z-man, in the hope of gaining some following or at least notoriety from an audience you can never, ever, hope to assemble via your own pitiful intellectual efforts.You are a parasite feeding off of other’s efforts.

        The wise choice would be to find deep stater that could keep the regime off of his and his family’s case after he leaves office.  Mike Flynn came to mind, but he really needs some Saddam Hussein-type character who will put a bunch of swamp creatures up against the wall should the situation require it.
Choosing someone like…well anyone on the list that’s been pitched will show that he’s not serious, with picks like Tim Scott showing that he’s just carny trash that got lucky.

            Yeah, that’s the ticket.  Hand out citizenship to all those majors in faux disciplines.
Way back when, in another time and another war, I had a friend who taught part-time at the local community college.  He remarked that he was told by the Dean that he should flunk none of the males in his class as they were most likely avoiding the draft through deferment (as both of us were as well).
Imagine how our poz’d “lower” ed system will react to this new incentive for IA’s.

                    I would have no problem with it in an idealized application—a degree in a rigorous discipline with a job at graduation.  However, the institutions are all poz’d.  All Trump would be doing is buying into the lie of “college for all”.

                Yep.  We had a growing problem with foreign students in my last department—they’d never leave.  They’d continue to postpone graduation so they could keep their student VISA and remain in the USA.  They also had little incentive money-wise as they all were hooked up on student employment, which was legal to do.  One student had been with us for 8 years in the graduate program!Finally, the new department head had to write a policy memo stating just how long each aspect of the PhD program was expected to take and those outside these parameters would be released from the program and their student VISA not renewed.  Since many faculty were hooked on cheap foreign student RA’s, the policy was controversial.

        The GreenCard with AA degree announcement should lose him the election. I think a significant segment of the oligarchy is backing away from Biden and moving to Trump. Trump is also saying anything he thinks he needs to say to solicit their support. Effectively that means he will promise a continuation of The Regime with better PR/optics. You can see on mainstream financial propaganda outlets the big business oligarchy spinning mass amnesty and immigration as an orderly, legal immigration system to fill the hundreds of thousands of jobs that are going unfilled.Everyone who can should take the ZMan path and get to an area and do what you can to surround yourself with your kind that have a nice age range spread. Now, make no mistake, you may be forced to go Irish and oppose the buses of Somalis and Congolese that will roll up to the hotels and Section 8 housing that all of the new jobs will be created to build to benefit the oligarchs selling the “orderly” immigration – a kinder gentler phrasing.Get local and be ready to carry out your politics at a local level. This may mean being confrontational when those buses roll up.This country is long finished and whether it is Biden or Trump whoever stands behind them and runs things via the administrative state is going to FINISH THE JOB!Things are not over for us, but it is time to start the process of clearning some land, planting trees and doing our best to ensure that we have heirs of quality to enjoy and extend their shade.

        You are probably right that Trump will pick someone “safe”, acceptable to the men in gray suits, and known to be a “safe pair of hands.” For all his bluster and bravado, Trump is not really that radical a figure, at least on the domestic front. The sad thing is that in his position I would probably pick someone “safe” as well — these are the realities of power. Let us take solace in the fact that the legions of people who are backing Trump are not going away and the clamor for real change will remain with or without him.

        “Our democracy’ is a rigged game in which the house must always win. In the end, that will be the lesson of Trump and the populist rebellion that produced him.”That’s fine—unless you’ve not quite crossed over (mentally) the “great divide” here on the DR.  Whatever demoralizes the “Normies” out there benefits us in the long run.  Such  may be too late, or not enough, but it’s of benefit if it changes perception of the process and one’s role within.As I’ve said for as long as I can remember and Z-man repeats, “You can’t win, you can’t break even, hell—you can’t even quit the game…”.  😉

        The most hilarious part of the Dick Cheyney selection was that Cheyney made it himself.  Tim Kaine’s son being a member of antifa was the most memorable part of his selection as Hillary’s running mate.  After a quick search I see they have been able to keep him out of the news since his 2017 arrest.
Does Trump have any good options?  I hear JD Vance’s name thrown around and he may be the best on the list, but isn’t a great choice either.

        “If Trump picks him (Youngkin), it means the regime has decided to let him win and then wear his administration as a skin suit. In effect, the populist rebellion will have officially died.” Bingo. It’s long overdue for private equity to have its own Vice President.The surest way to win to is have all the bets covered and take the vig. If the Regime is smart, or has any sense of self-preservation, it will put up Youngkin and just co-opt Trump if he “wins”. They should have done this the first time and spared us the theatrics.

            That is an eminently reasonable list.  Everyone in this thing will find someone on it to be unhappy about, which is always a good sign.  At some point, we have to grow up.  Until we realize that we can’t get everything we want, we will get nothing we want.I’d suggest Sam Dickson.  But the point is to balance the factions, if that is even the word for the current situation.  I am a big proponent of the “Let A Hundred Flowers Bloom” approach, but without coordination we get a lot of silos but no roses.For what it is worth, there were six Algerians in the original FLN leadership, representing another twenty or so on a Revolutionary Committee.

        Somewhat OT, it is getting interesting to see the Coalition of the Ascendant fire at each other.There was a big anti-Fa, Hamas riot against certain people on Pico/Robertson on Sunday. A synagogue was vandalized, cars keyed, lots and lots of people beat up, and various businesses that might or might not be owned by certain people vandalized. The cops did not show up for hours.Taylor Lorenz of the Washington Post is out on damage control, alleging that the synagogue in question was “selling Palestinian land” — it was apparently a private conference (not publicized) on real estate investment in Israel.Point being that this riot was organized by Soros, i.e. the CIA. Just as the effort to kick a certain people off UCLA and USC campuses were done by Soros, in other words the CIA. Soros is the CIA and vice versa, the say Robert Maxwell was the Mossad and vice versa, or Whitey Bulger was the FBI and vice versa. Until two of them became inconvenient.Coupled with the latest O’Keefe sting (against some greasy Indian dude with ultra annoying accent) where the main complaint by the Hindu Dindu was that Indians were not running Disney but a certain people, we are seeing the fighting for the spoils.This to me explains Sailer. WHY is he getting a book now? And all that promotion?A certain people are desperate to return to the 1980s and figure Sailer is the mechanism. Same with Trump — Trump is a desperate try to return to the 1980s. Its not happening of course, you cannot call the bullet back. Those certain people are getting purged. On the Managerial Side by the non-White, Alphabet plus Girl Bosses running the same Party of Chaos / Color Revolution playbook over and over again like Bear Bryant I formation in 1980. Because its what they know, and they want also competitors purged. [“Big” figures in Blackrock and State Street and other CIA aligned / controlled organizations like Larry Fink are OK with this because it does not hurt them. People like Bill Ackman getting purged, not so much.] Meanwhile White guys have a Sex Pistols No Future. There is no incentive for them whatsoever to do anything but flip over the table.Trump does not matter — he will be dead in Jail by late July. That has been clear for months now. The Judge will not allow the Secret Service in jail and that will be that. No man, no problem. The FBI likely has it all planned out. Insiders certainly are acting like that — hence the Draft including White women.Thomas Wolfe was correct, you cannot go back home. Comes the Hour, comes the Man, and someone (not Trump) is going to emerge, my bet out of resistance to the draft and being sentenced to death on the Russian or Taiwan fronts.

        “Then you have the fact that you cannot let South Asians anywhere near power in a white country. Just look at what is happening in Canada and Britain.”Look what happened in the eight years Zero was installed as President vis a vis immigration. He put his thumb on the scale and flooded this country with people from that part of the world. I can’t believe cucks would be so stupid to allow that to happen. The people who run this country are goddamned stupid. They have no survival instinct whatsoever. We’re being reduced to a minority in these idiots want to speed up the process. Jesus fücking Christ these people are dumb.We need to treat immigration like we’re guarding a bank vault and people on our side are too dumb to understand what it takes at this point.Oh, and PS, I think Zero qualifies as a South Asian, at least in his soul.

It would be interesting to hear a bit more about that, since it’s not something that one comes across everyday, the only instance that comes to mind off the top of my head is some boxer owning a tiger, but I’m sure that is something that was handled by flunkies rather than being an actual pet.
