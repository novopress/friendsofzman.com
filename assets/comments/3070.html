        Fauxcahontas is not that much younger than Shrillery. (She’s two years younger). I know she’s beloved by nitwits that don’t understand what a tool she is. I don’t see her getting it either.

        You must be a off your meds, Ed, because that scenario makes the top three list of any wing nut, of which I am one.

        The Democratic nominee for president will be Hillary Clinton, who will make a respectable effort but lose to the Republican nominee, who is unknown (probably Mitt).  Two years later, the Democrats will retake Congress.
At least this is what us Democrats understand.  But it is interesting that you all are so worried about Elizabeth Warren.

        I was told by one committed lefty in the UK that the trains running late was all Thatcher’s fault. I was told this twenty years after she was PM and following 13 years of Labour rule where they did absolutely nothing to ‘fix the faults’ of long past Tory governments.
One can only presume that in those 13 years of unopposed power the left was far too busy to actually do anything.

        Fauxcahontas is a Leftists’ Liberal. Smug, self-satisfied, few facts at her disposal, lies, liberal talking points, etcetera and so forth. But the War on Women is raging! Republicans are responsible for Evil in the modern world! She managed to get herself elected in Massachusetts because, well, it’s Massachusetts, for crying out loud! I don’t think her campaign powwows are going to fly nationwide. Fake Indians Need Not Apply.
