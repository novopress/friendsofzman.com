        Seems like yet another baiting strategy.  These idiots live in constant hope that they can fool Russian into an attack on NATO.  France is probably also trying to bait other NATO countries into the war.
Nobody is actually this stupid.  The Russians know.  The public knows.  It‚Äôs just how the West rolls these days.

        On the Other Hand-Analysis isn‚Äôt Advocacy-OTOH. We üá∫üá∏ have absolutely secured Europe under our boot, there‚Äôs no more reaching for Russia, far less trade with China.  Even France now our poodle.  Strategic Depth is gained.  Atlantic Rim secured.   PACRIM also under our Boot, Japan rearms.  Australia is quite tamed.   War with China an option.  The Factories return.This is evil, but it‚Äôs true.  It‚Äôs competent Imperialism.Ukraine is irrelevant except as club to beat Russia, just as Israel by the way is used to beat Arabs.The Jew hate ‚Äì hatred of the Jews here ‚Äì blinds people to the truth that we fought no wars for Israel,  we fought wars for Kuwait and Saudi.Analysis isn‚Äôt Advocacy.

            I‚Äôd say the first time, in 1990, was for Kuwait/Saudi. The second time, in 2003, that was for Israel.

                Nah.   They were both for Israel.  Pat Buchanan nailed it in the fall of 90 when he called out the ‚ÄúAmen Corner‚Äù pushing for war.  They were all tribe.

        One of the things I‚Äôve noticed about Macron is his timidity in the face of resistance. There is no strong resistance to helping Ukraine, so Macron appears confident. But give him a popular uprising and he turns tails and runs.

        The one thing the French have going for them in NATO membership. The U.S. might not like it that the French are taking a leadership role in this (unilateral) decision to send troops. If Trump comes into power, he might be especially pissed.

        It took humanity thousands of years to start talking openly about sex. How much longer before genetic inclinations of the nations will be discussed as openly?Russians were concurred and ruled by Tatar nation who were the greatest warriors of Middle Ages. It took centuries for these 2 nations to become equal and completely intermarried. The 3d Romanov Zar Peter the Great was 7/8 Tatar and a great warrior himself. Russian grit and devotion to the patriotic ruler in the time of war is legendary. Putin has close to 90% approval rating, as he is perceived by the Russians to be strong, unyielding patriot and leader.

            The genetic inclinations of nations were quite openly discussed in my grandfather‚Äôs time, and without any opprobrium, but it was going out of fashion by the time I came along. Now it‚Äôs a hanging offense. So, a whole lot can change in 3 generations.

        After the Cold War some fool said there would be no more industrial war, and the only fighting would be infantry combat units with some air support. The West believed it, and so are completely unprepared to face Russia or China. What combat systems are new aren‚Äôt appropriate for this conflict, and the old stuff has been outclassed by the enemy.If America was the America of the past then this would be a huge win for the Military Industrial Complex because it would me a complete retooling of the military with weapons development, manufacture and support, but we‚Äôre on the cusp of a debt collapse and so that won‚Äôt be possible.

        In the first turning 1940-1965, we had the full employment and ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all in this together‚Äù of WW2, then the post war peace and prosperity with new homes, new cars and TV‚Äôs, paved highways, The Beatles, then Korea and just a whisper of Vietnam on the horizon. Our money was safe, and blacks, Asians and Mexicans were kept in their place. Children could safely play outside on their own, and teachers, doctors and policemen were still trusted. The tone of society was OPTIMISTICIn the second turning 1965-1990, we had Vietnam, college protests, AIDS, feminist movements, blacks demanding equal rights, having our gold standard removed, the savings and loan meltdowns, the change to medical HMO‚Äôs and increased medical care costs, Woodstock, summer blockbuster films like Jaws, the Godfather, Star Wars, and the beginnings of our upgraded involvement in the middle East. The Iran hostages, Gas shortage lines, Nixon and Watergate, the fall of the Soviet Union, The Democratic National Convention riot, SLA/Patty Hearst, Kent State, Reagan was shot, and we had a new detente with China. The tone of society was DEMANDINGIn the third turning, 1990-2015, we had bank and investment firm insolvencies, Swine Flu/Bird Flu, pension fund collapses, Saddam Hussein, a growing realization that our government was lying to us, Black Lives Matter, OJ‚Äôs trial, amnesty/open borders with no thought of the long term consequences, involvement in Kuwait and Iraq with our extended and continual inserting ourselves into world affairs without the consent of the governed. Same sex marriage, the affordable care act, Osama Bin Laden, The Clintons, NAFTA, Y2K, 9/11, the TSA, space shuttle Columbia explodes, Facebook, hurricane Katrina, the Internet, Monica Lewinsky, Scenes of mangled and dead soldiers, while our politicians sought to soothe us with honeyed lies. The tone of society was CAUTIOUSSo far, in the fourth turning 2015-2040, we were frightened into compliance with enforced masking, vaccines, fake money, onerous new laws and regulations, the unleashing of unrestrained craziness as if parts of the country had gone mad. Hillary loses to Trump, Brexit, Queen Elizabeth dies, Sandy Hook and mass shootings, the Me Too movement by women, Migrants invading Europe, Charlie Hebdo massacre, Zika virus, Flint Michigan water scandal. A slow burning realization starts to build once our children became pawns to the Karen/LGBTQ agenda, and a subsequent withdrawing from parts of society to refocus on what we wanted, not what ‚Äúthey‚Äù wanted for us. Time will tell how this all shakes out. The tone of society is BEWILDEREDThe First Turning comes around again 2040-2065. I categorize the tone of society for this period as DETERMINED. We shall see-

            They would have to refuel multiple times and cross three countries. Russia would see them coming an hour before they arrived in Ukraine. I would assume Russia has S-400 and now S-500 batteries in Belarus. That means the planes would enter Ukraine airspace and then get knocked out of the sky.

                Oh they‚Äôll see them take off in real time. Even if they survived a confrontation with Russia their airfields would get hammered and they‚Äôd have no place to land.

                Ukraine is a third party. Striking either French or Russian territory is a hit to the motherland. Retaliation need not be proportional at that point. French submarines and their sensors are world class. I could see Russian submarines, including boomers, disappearing left and right. Followed by missile attacks on French shipyards and aircraft factories. And then who knows.

                    You seem to be pretty sure about the French, their stuff is no more world class than anything Russian. Do not underestimate Russia, you‚Äôll be making the same assumptions as Napoleon and Hitler. It didn‚Äôt work for them either.

                        The French are at least a generation ahead of the Russians in submarine technologies. They are truly world class.Until recently, the Russian sub force was low quality. Now they are closing the gap but they don‚Äôt have much of a modern force yet.I am very familiar with Russians and have some as clients. I get along great with them. I studied the Russian language under Sergei Schishkoff (sp) who was Kruchev‚Äôs principal translator. I am a former member of the Russian skydiving association and have played around with Russian aviators at various Russian airfields and dropzones.Russia is a land power. The French are a sea power. French submarine technologies are superior to the Russian counterparts. Russian missiles and related technologies are at least as good as French counterparts and in many aspects superior to the French.Facts are facts. But hey you do you.

The French naval aviators (unlike the Brits they actually have serviceable aircraft carriers) have posted some amazing chillout videos on YouTube.
That said, the Rafale is a good aircraft, but it is not head and shoulders above the F-16, Eurofighter, or Saab Gripen.
As for subs, the Swedes managed to come up with a model that repeatedly sank a US carrier during joint exercises in the mid-00s. The US Navy rented it so they could study it.

        Unlike little Putin, Napoleon was a genuine Great Man. Only one other man had a comparable military career in history:

            Given that Putin isn‚Äôt a general, it‚Äôs kind of hard to compare to Napoleon, so what exactly is your point other than you don‚Äôt like Putin?
Speaking of which, what about Putin don‚Äôt you like? As best as I can tell, he reined in the oligarchs who emerged after the West‚Äôs economic rape of Russia. Then, Putin set about rebuilding the Russian economy and state and has largely been successful, at least in terms of Russian history.
Napoleon, in contrast, cost France huge amounts of men and left it defeated.

                Don‚Äôt take this the wrong way, but were you sleeping the entire time between 2014 and 2022, when Ukraine was killing people in Donetsk and Luhansk because they did not want to be ruled by corrupt Western Ukraine? Particularly when Euro-Maidan was so obviously (and later admittedly) a Western intelligence coup.Yes, plausible deniability and all, even to the point that even Western media played film clips of all the Nazi iconography from Azov headquarters and barracks, but it isn‚Äôt like you can buy artillery shells and mortars on eBay. Someone with access to that kind of weaponry was behind killing all those ethnic Russians.Mostly, I‚Äôm just opposed to people getting killed. By anyone, really, but particularly when they are killed by their governments for being in the opposition party.

                I have never, not once, heard a civnat say they wish the USA was more like Israel. But I have heard a lot of dissidents say that.
The admirable thing about Russia (vs the GAE) is that it at least has the sense to act in its own interest. Which is really all an AINO dissident wants of his regime.

I‚Äôm not delusional enough to imagine that Russians or Putin gives a damn about me or mine.  I‚Äôm also aware that win or lose everyone I care about will suffer. So no I am not enthusiastically anti-American and if you are then you may be mad, or not a resident of the United States.

        Macron saw those ads from the interwebs that promise ‚ÄúWith this one weird trick‚Ä¶‚Äù. Come summer he will need a weird trick like a hot war with Russia to announce some form of martial law (it will be called something else) and curfews. Last summer the Noires almost succeeded in burning France‚Äôs cities down and once activated by sunshine, they will try again. Late in August, after they brought in the harvest, the white rural population will join the fun as they are extremely displeased and have acquired a taste for setting fire to things in the city.Of course, starting a real war in order to divert attention from a proto-civil war would be the act of a clinically insane person. Or an insanely cynical person. But then we are talking about dwarfish ghoul married to a‚Ä¶ something ancient. Also an Alumni of Rothschild &amp; Cie. So the President of France may well be both things at the same time: A raving lunatic AND a calculating sociopath, willing to shove a couple of 1000s of soldiers into the volcano to distract from other problems.

            Z: ‚ÄúFor the last two years we have seen Western leaders pick the worst option, as if they have a death wish. Maybe that is the way to understand this thing. It is a long slow suicide of the West, and they will not be stopped until they bring the whole thing crashing down.‚Äù===============Minimefred: ‚Äúwe are talking about a dwarfish ghoul married to a‚Ä¶ something ancient. Also an Alumni of Rothschild &amp; Cie.‚Äù===============We would do well to consider the possibility that Macaroni was SELECTED to play the role which he is playing in this drama precisely because Rothschild &amp; Cie fully intend to stage a show wherein White Roman Catholic Frenchmen slaughter White Constantinoplean Orthodox Russians.Every dead Christian Frenchman &amp; every dead Christian Russian is a Win-Win-Win for Rothschild &amp; Cie.And it‚Äôs all because Sigmund Freud‚Äôs nephew, Edward Bernays, discovered that half or more of all goyim will believe anything they read in the newspapers or hear on the wireless or watch on the Talmudvision.My guess is that a toad like Macaroni is barely even sentient [or else Rothschild &amp; Cie have promised him billions of shekels for his perfidy].

Step me through this one, please. Or, really, just the bit of why Pharisees getting Christians killed is materially different than any of the other Satanists getting Christians killed.

                I am convinced that the Council of the Sanhedrin considers geopolitics to be mere THEATER***.The Council looks for a barebones script which has a plausible chance of attracting &amp; capturing &amp; cementing goyische interest, then The Council hires a few old hands to round &amp; soften &amp; smooth out the sharp edges, and once The Council has at least a ‚ÄúBeta‚Äù version of the script in hand, the Council begins hiring the goysiche actors &amp; actresses whom they can trust to pull off the roles which are required in the production.And I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if The Council spent literally DECADES discovering &amp; then teaching &amp; training &amp; emboldening these goyische stooges [such as Macaroni] to play their assigned roles in the drama.===============***Remember, wars have THEATERS, just like plays &amp; musicals &amp; operas have theaters.And the etymology of ‚Äútheater‚Äù  fits perfectly with the sadistic cynicism of the Bronze Age Death Cult.theater: ‚ÄúMiddle English theatre, from Old French, from Latin theƒÅtrum, from Greek theƒÅtron, from theƒÅsthai, to watch, from theƒÅ, a viewing‚Äù.Never forget that Nietzsche considered the Bronze Age Death Cultists to be consummate actors &amp; actresses.===============Andrew Anglin has a theory which holds that Talmudvision has become so powerful that Normies can‚Äôt believe any phenomenon in this world until first they‚Äôve seen it broadcast on Talmudvision.So that, e.g., a Normie will just as soon believe in a Stanley Kubrick mock-up of a lunar landing as they will believe in the real thing.That‚Äôs the dadgum near near about omnipotent power that the theatrical mesmerization &amp; hypnotization hold over the Normies; the power which Edward Bernays stumbled upon when he invented modern advertising.

            Currently reading Eric Zemmour‚Äôs book ‚ÄúLa France N‚Äôa Pas Dit Son Dernier Mot‚Äù. In it he quotes a lot of elite figures who confess to him that they expect civil war in France, but they‚Äôre too cowardly to say so publicly, constantly toeing the woke line in public.

        Professor John Mearsheimer has been a counter to the madness of Western foreign policy in Ukraine for many years now. Some will remember him as the co-author ofThe Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy. Then I watched this:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BZlovgELVI&amp;t=159sHe defines military power as a combination of wealth plus population size. He says the U.S. is in a good position to compete with countries like China, because (unlike China) we are a wealthy country with a growing population due to immigration. Will leave it to the readers here to find the logical fallacy with his argument.In the words of John Derbyshire, ‚ÄúWe are doomed!‚Äù

            So all you need to do to increase the size of your army is invite the enemy soldiers to join up!

            Mearsheimer reminds us of an eternal truth: Nerds are wrong. Even when they reach a right conclusion they arrive via an autistic (retarded) path. He‚Äôs a follow-the-money guy because money can be counted. A side effect of this is that he ‚Äúnotices‚Äù JQ type stuff. He‚Äôs a count-the-bodies guy because bodies can be counted, so his idea of war is *body piling*. In a justly run world his profession would be winning that game where you guess how many jellybeans are in a huge jar.

        A NATO ‚Äútripwire‚Äù force in Ukraine, without American troops, is a curious proposition. Because nobody should be under any illusions about a purely European NATO‚Äôs ability to stand up to the Russians. Without large scale conscription, they‚Äôd be overrun quickly. They just don‚Äôt have the manpower (or air power), any of them, or even all of them together. And if they did choose conscription, and the people didn‚Äôt revolt, they‚Äôve nothing with which to equip the conscripts.The presence of American troops doesn‚Äôt necessarily cure any or all of these ills, but at least it makes the Russians have to think about it more. I am reminded of the English Bob analogy, Richard Harris in Unforgiven, vis a vis shooting the queen vs shooting the president‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWhy not shoot the president?‚Äù Same idea here. Why not shoot some Frenchmen?

        The French have no stomach for sustained military losses, Not since Dien Bien Phu in Vietnam has there been a French army that risked annihilation, Imagine the scenario. Their troops are dead, While the politicians wring their hands, the media falsely tries to spin it as a good thing, Public faith in the media plummets. The result? France is more receptive than it has ever been to a far-right coup.

            Dark, you‚Äôve got a point there wrt France being casualty adverse.  I seem to remember some French policing in the Serbian war where they pulled out and left the civilians they were there to protect to the tender mercies of the Muzzies.  Same I believe happened in Africa as well.  But these are old memories and not fact checked.

                I think that it may have been the reverse, perhaps Srebreniza [sp.?]. The Muzzies of that community had been not to clandestinely supporting ethnic cleansing of the Serbs, the French were there as ‚Äúpeacekeepers‚Äù, and when the Serbs showed up in force to haul away and kill all of the Muzzie men, seeing their chances should they try to intervene, the French decided to leave the Allahu Akhbar boys to their fate. But your main point stands.

            Wikipedia informs us that the French sustained roughly 90,000 casualties in the Algerian War of 1954-1962, including between 25,000 and 30,000 killed. In the same league, anyway, as Korea and Viet Nam. Maybe not an ‚Äúannihilation‚Äù but certainly a heavy price paid for a lost cause. All of this occurred after Dien Bien Phu.

                I live a bit over 3 hours from Chicago, and was about an hour away for 20 years. Confusing the hand holding the knife makes absolutely no difference in the murder rate. If anything, ‚Äúthe other hand‚Äù reins them in to some degree, like when St. George Floyd riots are no longer useful.
The only thing that seems to make a difference is winter. Maybe if we could have an ice age, we‚Äôd get the continent back.

        The dirty little secret behind the insanity in Ukraine.Western governments have been spending well beyond their means for decades now and using those funds to buy votes and enrich their elite patrons. The bill is coming due and the globalists were counting on raping Russian and Ukrainian resources as a means of keeping the plates spinning. Hence, the absolute necessity of removing Putin and fracturing Russia into exploitable components. As such, the war in Ukraine is existential for both the West and Russia.But Russia is getting stronger by the day and the West is verging on collapse. When the smoke clears, Russia is going to be just fine and the West will have begun its economic death spiral. Which is the only path to remedy for the West. There has to be a return of real hardship, a reemergence of survival of the fittest, and a culling of the pathogens.It is not the analogy to Napoleon that Macron has to worry about, but the analogy to the French Revolution and Madame Guillotine.

If Russia is not essentially conquered, eventually BRICS will sponsor a commodity-backed reserve currency to compete with the fiat petrodollar, and then it‚Äôs game over for the GAE ( it‚Äôs pronounced ‚Äúgay‚Äù).There are cultural reasons as well. Russia is the last bastion of uncorrupted European Christendom. That‚Äôs hard to believe for anyone who lived through the Cold War, but it‚Äôs true. Mainline Protestantism has been taken over by homosexuals, Evangelicalism by Zionists. An antipope sits on the Throne of St. Peter.  Russia is all that is left standing for the traditional culture and morality of the West, which is really ironic, given its historical ambivalence to Western institutions.My thought all along has been that sooner or later NATO will take up defensive positions west of the Dnieper to essentially freeze the conflict, but also to create an undeclared state of war with Russia that will allow the GAE to consolidate its power among its subject populations.  The plan is for a new, hotter Cold War, that slowly eats away at Russia, eventually producing the desired regime change, if Armageddon doesn‚Äôt come first.FWIW, I don‚Äôt think the ruling elites want to destroy the world, or at least  not themselves, but I do think they believe that any world not governed by them doesn‚Äôt deserve to exist.

                There‚Äôs a darn good reason the main BRICS players have been buying up gold and dumping Treasuries as fast as they can; they‚Äôre planning a gold and commodities backed alternate currency (that isn‚Äôt dependent on mining electricity).
Uncle Dolphie, Saddam and Ghaddafi are waving sadly in the distance.

        I admit to being reluctant to accept that we may be approaching a 1914 moment ‚Äî starting World War III over the Ukraine would be utterly insane ‚Äî but very few Britons in January 1914 believed that an unlikely event such as a German invasion of Belgium would have anything to do with them. Americans, meantime, assumed a European war would be none of their business at all.
And we all know that our present-day politicians and public are much more intelligent now than were the people of 1914-18, right?

            We are not nearly as intelligent as we were in 1914 but we are much, much, much better informed. The sheer amount of noticing going on in Twitter and social media, as well as the refusal of the multi-generational, Scots-Irish ‚Äúmilitary‚Äù families to let their sons enlist, gives me reason for optimism. The propaganda from 2003 Iraq or even 2012 ISIS is no longer working, not to mention the levels of propaganda that would be required to actually support WW3.

        The specter of the Orange Man lingers over Europe, so we‚Äôre seeing some very strange stuff from Macron and others too, especially the Poles.I think some of these folks want to Trump-proof their Ukraine policy. If they put French/NATO troops in Lvov, outside Kyiv or even Odessa, I guess they think they would present Trump with a fait accompli. Trump may find it politically impossible to reverse the act.Some of this may be driven by Macron‚Äôs domestic political situation. But I think his thinking certainly reflects a substantial faction of the NATO/EU elite. They have been pushing this war as hard as the US MIC has pushed it. They are about to lose ‚Äì either by Russia winning in the field or by Trump shutting it down ‚Äì and they are throwing a temper tantrum.

                Trump was quoted as saying that instead of giving money to Ukraine we should make it a loan.   A distinction with no difference.   However Orban said after he met with Trump that, if elected, Trump would send no money to Ukraine.
So who knows.  It seems Trump has the opinion of the last guy he talked to.    Orban said that Trump is ‚Äúa man of peace.‚Äù     Except for the Gazacaust and the eventual invasion of Lebanon.   That is A-OK with Trump.

            There was a short article the other day about Dems manipulating and hardening the bureacratic system to prevent an incoming Trump from terminating bureaucrats and at will positions within the executive branch. Essentially Trump-proofing the Swamp against a gutting. I imagine SOTUS might have to sort that separation of powers argument but who wants to depend on 9 high priests to uphold whats left of the Republic?Anyway, I saw it as a blip in a news feed and IRL activities have kept me from digging further. Just wondering if any of you astute people have knowledge or thoughts on the subject?

        ‚ÄúMacron has been talking tough about doing this, but he has been cagey about if it will happen. So far, he has been trying to round up support from other NATO countries.‚ÄùThe salient thing to understand about Macron is that he is a sly, conniving, weaselly faggot. All this talk of sending French troops to Ukraine is hogwash. The European ‚Äúpowers‚Äù are pygmies who can attach themselves in subaltern fashion to the US behemoth but are incapable, individually or collectively, of waging a major war. Everyone know this. This bravado by Macron is garbage and everyone knows it. But it has a history ‚Äî France still likes to think of itself as a global power. This complex hails back to the colonial days, when France had a presence in Vietnam, in Africa, in South America (French Guiana, which it still has). I remember when France was conducting nuclear tests in the South Pacific from 1960 through to the ‚Äô90s ‚Äî the main purpose, I think, was to tell the world that France still matters on the world stage.

            The GAE and MIC have to be worried too, because the Russians have now shown that multiple M1A1 Abrams can be smoked on the battlefield by them drunk dumb Rooskies with those ancient T-72 tanks, which mysteriously now possess thermal imaging.

        I don‚Äôt mean to minimize the threat of pseudo-western madmen provoking a nuclear conflict with Putin . . . but . . . to be honest, I am more concerned and disgusted at present at US troops being sent to Gaza and Haiti.  The Gaza mission is just screaming for escalation ‚Äì who will be provide security to and vetting all the ‚Äòaid‚Äô ships from wherever?  And how convenient to have a floating dock so Israel can offload all the Gazans to the US and Europe as it has been telegraphing its intentions for years.  And we can offload US troops ‚Äì oh joy.Haiti?  Why do we have an embassy there, other than to help all the ‚ÄúHaitian-Americans‚Äù getting their social security payments and to issue visas for yet more ‚Äúnewcomers‚Äù?  Haiti has been a basket case for over 200 years because it is populated by inbred, imbecilic, and inhuman creatures.  And all the tourists online touting the Dominic Republic as a gleaming success story in comparison are seemingly unaware that the Dominicans are 50% sub-Saharan themselves.  That is one island I would LOVE to see ‚Äòtip over.‚Äô  I remember a former FS colleague posted there who told me of all the voodoo death threats against him (he headed the anti-fraud work in the visa section).  I had plenty of ‚Äòobeah‚Äô powder on visa applications but no death threats that I was aware of.Again, not to minimize the potential danger of escalation in Ukraine, but the constant proliferation of ‚ÄúUS troops‚Äù to meddle in various sh*thole mudpies is at least equally concerning.

You can say that again.
Take a look at any set of satellite images of the island Haiti and the DR inhabit.  One side (Haiti) has been made barren as the moon, the DR is still livable, tropical, and by comparison a paradise.  If the inhabitants of Haiti were not considered human, they‚Äôd be the subject of ‚Äúdepredation‚Äù hunting.  Something like we (Game and Fish) used to do here with coyotes to protect native wildlife.

            The Dominican Republic and Haiti sharing the same island is proof positive of the magic dirt theory (soon to be replaced, I think, by ‚Äúthe law of‚Äù). You see, the verdant and tropical part contrasting sharply along the line of the border with the eroded and almost barren part clearly demonstrates why Haitians are quite literally dirt poor. Now, if we were to evacuate them to the abundant lands of the U.S., they would be even better off than the Dominicans, at least those who aren‚Äôt yet themselves in the U.S. Same could be said for the desert strip of Gaza.You can watchhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAlEwYjaBRMfor a fuller explanation of these civilizational differences based onGuns, Germs, and Steelby Jared Diamond.

            I¬¥ve visited both the nations on Hispaniola, albeit 40 years ago. Even then, the DR was the Garden of Allah in comparison with Haiti. I never went back to either and certainly wouldn¬¥t now. My very decent and delightful former sister-in-law whom I‚Äôve known since adolescence, very much the ‚ÄúAdmiral¬¥s Daughter‚Äù type, went to Haiti with her humanitarian aid church group after the earthquake. No tourist activities for them, not without a native guard contingent. She had little to say about the experience and more remarkably had very few photos. Now 74, she travels to more photogenic places in Europe in a group of older ‚Äúadventure‚Äù travelers. Not a darkie in the lot. Some lessons learned are best left unspoken.

        Watching what were once great powers impotently posturing their great war powers like they are still the empires from times past is just embarrassing to watch. Sadder still is the realization the USA is speed-running the same decline. It all stems from the same source, the erosion of national identity and only empty platitudes and sterile culture in its place. Ends up people aren‚Äôt willing to sacrifice anything to live under an HR manual.
It would be fun to see these nations make propaganda ads for their military adventure just to read everyone mocking them.

                WEF Regional Managers. Brilliant.Imagine the spite and anger that the WEFRM must feel when they come into contact with the reality that they do not have the support of those who they look down upon, but who they need in order to be important and truly potent. Imagine the fear and shame when for all of their self-importance and grand ambitions of changing the world, they can‚Äôt marshal real power ‚Äì martial power.God help Europe that this spite will probably cause them to triple the number of invaders and colonizers they bring in per annum. Are there any Frenchmen in the military whose blood boils with Gallic pride and a desire to turn nostalgia into glory made manifest?The same question holds for all of the sportsball addled men of The West.

        It sounds like the Ukrainian army is starting to collapse and have no ability to hold ground wherever the Russians decide to advance.  A few thousand French light infantry will make no difference.  They‚Äôll be few into the grinder same as the Ukes.
The nice thing about using the Foreign Legion is not having to explain to French parents why their son was killed for no good reason.  So maybe Marcon will throw a regiment into the grinder before coming to his senses.

        Hey, the French Navy can contribute by evacuating troops from Odessa like they did in 1920. If the Turks let them transit the Bosporus, which they have not let any NATO ships do since the war started. What I think might be happening is Macron trying to be a tough guy, by claiming that the Bad Russian man wants to occupy all of Ukraine because he‚Äôs possessed by the spirit of Hitler, but I have argued for two years that the Russians are fighting an 18th century style kabinetskreig, and that occupation of all of Western Ukraine was never a war aim, notwithstanding the panic propaganda Western media has been shrieking since day one. So Macron wants to station troops in areas that the Russians have no intention of attacking with ground forces and occupying, like Lviv, thus proving he deterred the big bad Ivans with his token force.

            I wonder though, have Russian attitudes hardened since the start of the war? I kind of want to believe that now Odessa is an objective, if only to deprive the rump 404 of an outlet to the Black Sea. At some point Russia will have to make it impossible for the Ukraine to be troublesome ever again. Once there is no outlet to the sea and no real resources to exploit the West will drop the Ukraine like a hot potato.

                I have said Odessa is an objective for two years. However, it may not be taken in this war, if my reading of Russian grand strategy as a modern kabinettskreige. Putin and Russia now know that when this war ends, it will not end with total WWII style victory, nor do they want endless occupation of a sullen foreign puppet state, like Poland or Afghanistan. What they seem to understand is that the end of this war is only an extended armistice, an interbellum, much like the sequential wars of the 18th century. Thus Odessa might be taken and annexed in the next war, because the Russians are not retards. If they get Odessa by the end of this war, that‚Äôs a bonus. They took Crimea, and then consolidated and prepared for this war, where they have taken another bite, which they will use for the third war, whenever that comes.

        You can almost forgive the myopia of the American foreign policy establishment, as we are a younger country. Modern France only dates to the 18th century, but Gaul‚Äôs antecedents are pre-Christian era. Also France‚Äôs revolutionary foundation, unlike America‚Äôs, is very much a result of their rulers being overcommitted to funding foreign wars, namely ours. Then again, it‚Äôs not like our ‚Äústrategists‚Äù have to go digging deep into the past to see America ain‚Äôt what it once was, even as recently as World War II. We lost to goatherds in Afghanistan and paddy farmers in Southeast Asia. You can argue the wars were mismanaged or shouldn‚Äôt have been fought at all, but they go in the ‚ÄúL‚Äù column either way.Putin needn‚Äôt have reminded Macron of Napoleon‚Äôs defeat in Russia. He could have simply reminded Macron of how the little Corsican came to power in the first place. History says not only that France will lose a ground war with Russia‚Äîand terribly‚Äîbut that the French rulers might lose their heads if they invest too heavily in foreign wars, period.Then again, they have enough Saracens in their land now that they might lose their heads for entirely different reasons. And for the record, it wouldn‚Äôt bother me if Muslim invaders stormed their palaces and pied-√†-terres and made them all a head shorter. They could even cart the women off to their harems, though I don‚Äôt hazard Macron‚Äôs aging, Dr. Zaius-looking wife would get much action.Watching even snippets of the State of the Union or catching clips of the Oscars, I found myself wishing I could spread the rumor that our elite had gathered simply to insult the Prophet Muhammad and to depict Allah, before releasing a hundred virgin-hungry Jihadists with scimitars.No suis Charlie.

                It does seem that military adventurism, to continue as a policy, needs at least an occasional big success to keep spirits high and prospects bright. The GAE had the Spanish American War, WWI and WWII for this, then came Korea and Vietnam to dampen the fervor. Then Desert Storm happened at the perfect time that the unipolarly ascendant GAE needed it to renew the martial spirit. Now dampened once again by the subsequent 30 years of stupidity.Lacking such success, an empire becomes more limited to seemingly low cost, low intensity adventures of a such a nature that the folks back home forget they are happening. Which is about all the French military is good for nowadays. And maybe all the GAE military is good for.

                Algeria was literally France‚Äôs Vietnam.
France regularly slaughtered partisans trying to enter from Tunisia and Libya using motorized infantry, helo-borne air cav, and close air support.
French air cav regularly raided mountain villages with impunity.
The problem was that the French military lost popular support in Paris. They also lost in the court of world opinion, being repeatedly badly beaten in the UN by the Algerian delegation and JFK.

        I can‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs any popular support for sending troops to Ukraine.  Very few pay attention any more or care for that matter.  These GD supposed western leaders just do what they want and damn voter opinion and the torpedos.  Further, would Russia actually respond by sending missile barrages into Paris, Berlin or London?  That‚Äôs pretty frightening to contemplate.  Damn, these western governments to a man and woman need to be eliminated.

            Recent polls out of France show a weird split. A majority favor continuing support, but a larger majority oppose troops on the ground. Not that it matters, but with elections this July, Macron needs to avoid an embarrassing loss. On the other hand, maybe he wants a loss so he can then retire and hand out with his old lady.

            The Democrats have the same issue with their strategy of trying to blame the Ukraine failure on Republicans. Nobody outside the beltway gives a sh!te about a war that is essentially a border dispute between two countries that most Americans could not find on a map, particularly when nobody in our government will protect our borders.

        I‚Äôve always been concerned that the NATO would put troops in Ukraine for ‚Äúhumanitarian‚Äù reasons, creating a very dangerous situation. Putin should just make clear that any troops on Ukrainian soil for any reason will be considered the enemy and, thus, fair game.A Z noted, I just assumed this Macron talk was a political stunt, but these guys have shown themselves to be dangerously unrealistic. That said, everyone seems to be acknowledging that the war is effectively over, so why do something this late.The real question is whether Ukraine can hold out until the election. Very few Americans even remember that there‚Äôs a war in Ukraine, but a collapse of Ukraine would be enough to sway a few percentage points of voters, which Biden can ill afford to lose.

            A year ago important Russian pols were saying the war ends by the end of 2024. They never provided reasoning behind it, but that was the timeline and it is looking that way. Back when the offensive failed so spectacularly, I did a little back of the envelope math on Ukraine troop strength and barring some major change, 2024 was the limit.I am starting to wonder if things might happen faster. The reports coming out of Ukraine suggest the military is having trouble all along the front and Russians are planning a large summer operation. This may be why Europe is in a panic and Macron is floating the idea of troops on the ground in Ukraine. Maybe they think this will halt the collapse. Or maybe it is the start of a blame game.

                At some point Washington/NATO has to sh*t or get off the pot. Ukraine only has a chance in this war if directly supported by large numbers of American soldiers and arms. This means WW3. GAE needs a Pearl Harbor/911 moment, but thus far Russia has been too smart to give it to them.

                I agree. It‚Äôs all about the election and the timing is looking bad for the WH.I think that the Sullivan wing figured that they could keep Ukraine alive until the election, and then could let them collapse. Sure, it looks bad, but, whatever, we won the election and no one will care in a year.This would fit with the Russians saying the war ends in very late 2024.Unfortunately for Biden, that timeline might be speeding up. The Ukrainian military is showing serious signs of stress. Losing Avdivvika seems to have been a serious psychological blow along with a military disaster. What‚Äôs more, the loss of air defenses combined with Russia using those glide bombs means that the losses are dramatically higher and defense much more difficult.The WH would be smart to negotiate and take its medicine now rather the risk an embarrassing collapse in late summer, early fall. This might be why Europe is freaking out. They‚Äôre worried the US is going to cut and run soon.

I think you‚Äôre spot on.
GAE leaders appear to believe they can insert their troops into Ukraine and force some kind of Korea-style DMZ setup on Russia.
It‚Äôs hard to know if that would work. It all depends on how far Russia is willing to prosecute this war. This scenario also significanly raises the chance of tactical nukes being used.

                It‚Äôs not a crazy scenario. Ukraine starts to collapse, refugees start heading to the EU, general services start to break down. US and/or European countries ‚Äì not as NATO but as individual countries ‚Äì move troops into western Ukraine to distribute food, maintain order and keep the power on to keep people warm.
We‚Äôd claim that we‚Äôre not there to fight the Russians but to help the people of Ukraine. We stay on our side of the river.
Thankfully, the US and European populations don‚Äôt want any part of something like that, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that it won‚Äôt happen.

                That should work out well. US has such a stellar record at holding up their puppets. At least until they become inconvenient.
Putin would laugh his butt off if NATO did anything that stupid. Let NATO become the bad guys tamping down the inevitable real or astroturf pro-Russian protests.

        This always follows the same pattern. We are now approaching the MAC-V stage of the inevitable.
