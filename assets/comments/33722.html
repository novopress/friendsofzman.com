        You hit on the major point. America has opened itself and all of Europe to international predation. It sold itself off to alien strangers. The path out of this is messy. Even in America entire Universities are colonized by aliens – both the classrooms and the faculty and graduate departments.Yet, Trump the great reformer’s bold plan is to increase international predation by selling Gold Cards to the highest bidder.Putting your wealth and institutions up for sale shows no signs of being taken off the table. In that sense, the nationalists, are not nationalists. Things have taken a positive turn, but without mass deportations, and beginning to send home the imported economic elites, the situation will continue to degrade.

            The selling of Western Gentile institutions by the parasitic elites to the globe is going to backfire spectacularly.  When there are no Western Gentiles left, the whole project crumbles, a husk of it’s former self.  These people desperately want to be a part of Our World, yet their presence in ever increasing numbers is what will destroy it. Oh the irony.

                they don’t actually want to be a part of our world though.  They seek only the benefits of having access to us and what we’ve created.

This is not comforting at all. And this is the reason:

                That is part of their plan.  They want a world of rich and poor.  They want much lower consumption for the masses so they can “save the planet.”  Your kids will commute in their 15 minute city on public transit or a bicycle while they will continue to drive nice cars and fly around the world.  This will probably backfire spectacularly as most of the things they want to preserve for themselves will likely not work as small industries.

Vox Day thinks that Jamie White was assassinated because he was working on an Infowars expose of (((Victoria Nuland))).
Unfortunately, Vox Day doesn’t seem to offer up any further information on the (((Nuland))) angle.

            Just so.  And now the great savior has declared Thomas Masse, the sole member of congress not owned by AIPAC, persona non grata, because he opposes yet another massive spending bill.  The worthless dollar becomes ever more worthless, because there’s an unlimited supply.  I’m not naive; I do realize that most ‘business’ in AINO is nothing more the numbers manipulation, but I side with Massie over Trump any day.

                Trump does what his masters tell him to. They cannot have Massie in the US Senate. It’s going to be hilarious watching the MAGA civil war over this as the Israeli Influencers kneecap the Deplorables.

                Trump is always mad at the “budget hawk” guys. They contradict him unnecessarily. The numbers are fake. Demanding they be reconciled like real accounting can only make things worse.The Republican establishment uses the libertarian guys to target the fraction of the budget that “works” for the citizenry (somewhat), SS and Medicaid and such, while protecting the inflationary institution-welfare and “small business” (white replacement) type stuff. The latter is The Market™.Trump is trying to maintainall of the abovewhile shrinking the professional-class Democrat patronage network. The fake numbers shouldn’t be usedonlyto hurt normal people,onlyto make the rich richer,onlyto pay the other side’s voters, etc.Everyone hates this idea of his.

                I guess Trump really likes proving his detractors correct.  I was very heartened by the huge show of support for Massie on Twitter.  I hope he does run for senate and manages to defeat AIPAC’s ‘unlimited money’ threat.

            Recently I read Z Man and it does seem like there is quite alot of MAGA in-between the lines. Perhaps I’m well wrong on this. Trump did a few decent things, and seems to continue to do them.But even though America’s foreign policy and economic policy may be changing, entering the 21st Century, so to speak; you’ve still got a huge non-white problem and declining general culture. Just like Europe.This is why I miss Lawrence Auster’s writing so much. He often cut to the heart of what some of the biggest problems facing the States were: immense black violence and dysfunction, Islam, and brazen and in-your-face Godlessness.Still, if Trump is doing decent things, I suppose it is a retardation to Leftism… perhaps.I’m not trying to disparage Z here. Perhaps this governmental shift is more massive than I give it credit for. I just see non-whites and various dysgenic types everywhere I look. That, to me, seems the reality.

                You’re not wrong.  There’s definitely a triumphalist tone to many online now, and certain merkans love deriding Europe as old and washed up, even as they lay claim to European lineage.

                    It was perhaps forceful of me to use the term MAGA, which I ought not to have, as I don’t believe the Z is MAGA in any way – nor many of the commenters here.Triumphalistis a much better word.
I understand the respite that Trump brings. But, as I’ve said, and I know you agree to, in the long run we’re going to be dealing with more and more third world garbage.
And that counts for almost everything.

                        Ostei,Auster passed away early 2013, I think. Whilst he never appeared (as far as I know) to have had a proper mainstream career, he was repeatedly targeted by all the standard leftist oddballs. Just like others who do his work.I found him valuable because of his grammatical erudition and general knowledge of the flaws of modern America (Black Run America, I think it was known as). He did have his differences with other faces in this movement, but hisView from the Rightblog was brilliant. I’ve linked the archives above in response to Wolf, if you’re interested.He was also a Christian – so wrote alot about that.

For those, perhaps like our host or the excellent Jared Taylor, who believe that we can strike some sort of deal with some of the chosen, Larry is one of the best examples.
I don’t think such a deal is possible, given genetic predilections and historical hatreds. But to be fair, I have no complaints with Stephen Miller.

Not all Jews are “big Jews” at the heights of power and wealth nor are they all raving frizzy-haired marxists.  But the Trump Jews are in the minority unfortunately.
But don’t forget that at least 40% of white gentiles are “nice white lady liberals” who will cast you out if you should ever utter a negative thing about illegals or trannies or whatnot.

                    Wolf,
You can still hit up his archives here:
http://www.amnation.com/vfr/archives.html
Alot of the articles are still absolutely brilliant and incisive. To me, he mixed traditional theory (i.e., what should tradition be) with down-to-earth cultural commentary.
His commentary on black-on-white crimes are priceless, as are his amendments to John Derbyshire’s rules about conduct oneself around blacks.

        I wonder if Europe isn’t much closer than we think to actual, organized populist violence. The British kinda sorta tried it already, as did the “Yellow Vests” in France (where they have a long tradition of political violence). Seemingly every other day brings word of some Muzzie going on a stabbing spree in Berlin, or driving a car into a crowd, for motives that will never be known… and Berlin’s response is to outlaw AfD. The EU is about to throw that Romanian guy into prison (if they haven’t already). Once they realize that American occupation troops — the only “effective” military formations on the Continent — aren’t going to be used as Brussels’ on-call riot police….

            I think that’s why they’re so afraid of Musk and Twitter/social media. One precipitating incident can be suppressed, but if he chooses, Musk alone can call millions of eyes to another atrocity, and from there, it can break open. The “Arab Spring” conditions are there for a revolt of Europeans, ironically (Alanis, pick up the phone) because of the “refugee crisis” brought about because of a social media driven populist revolt in the OG “Arab Spring” of 2011.

                I guess the problem is, with what will they revolt? Unless arms are being funnelled surreptitiously to the Euro masses they will be reduced to wielding stones, torches and pitchforks. And while that may have been supportable in 1381 and 1789, I’m afraid it’s just not on in 2025.

                        Good point. But perhaps what matters most is the fighting spirit of the comparative elites. The commies, I think, were ready to be beaten and didn’t put up much of a fight. Are the postmodern freaks similarly ready to be beaten, or are they willing to turn the boulevards red in order to retain power?

                Alanis Morissette’s 1995 chart-topper “Ironic” is itself, after a fashion ironic, because not a single of the several themes in the song fit the “correct” (literary) definition of irony. It’s still a good song, and the whiny bitch was one of the better female pop stars of the 90s (IMO).

            The entire political structure of Europe is in place to tamp down organized populist violence and defy the will of the people. This has been the case since Operation Gladio but it’s become much more explicit the past 15 years, starting with the Greek financial crisis. The tools and systems the Eurocrats put into place to deal with those pesky unruly Greeks are now being used on Germans, French, Hungarians, Romanians, Danes, and anyone else who dares step out of line, on anything, from finances to homosexuality to immigration. But, now we are talking about war, it’s getting serious.

                    It’s popped up over and over again, the first I remember is France rejecting the EU constitution in a 2005 treaty, then the Netherlands doing it a few days later. What happened afterwards? They just  revised a bunch of old treaties with all the stuff from the rejected Constitution and claimed that was totally legit and now inforce. All they needed was John Roberts calling it a tax. The point is, the EU was invented to supersede the will of the European people and that always has been a source of tension and always will as long as it exists.

                The British have been the historic thorn in the side of Europe for centuries. But they are about to come to an ignominious end. Germany will inevitably gravitate back to its historic trading partners in the east, a history that stretches back to the 14th century. With the opening up of trade all the way to China, the Persian Gulf, and India via land routes, the British will have come to a dead end with very little to trade. Germany and central Europe will flourish.

            Iwonder if Europe isn’t much closer than we think to actual, organized populist violence.Yes. Europe is waiting for a spark. Among the many reasons for its psychotic fixation on Putin and Russia is the need for a diversion for the army of angry young indigenous Europeans, who are responding with a resounding “no” to calls for them to defend the status quo. The Eurocrats had no problem selling out their own, and in turn their own is waiting to put the blade to their throats. I think that came close to happening in the States, too, hence the elite abandonment of the America’s EU knock-offs. Russia may pose some danger around the margins of Europe, particularly in the Baltics–I doubt it, but concede it is possible–but the rising fear in Europe is over restless serfs in its midst. Same as it ever was, same as it ever was.Among the many reasons to exit NATO ASAP is in fact is the prospect of civil war in Europe. Is there any doubt NATO will be used to slaughter native Europeans and quell civil unrest long before it does anything that remotely resembles a purported defense of the continent? Regime change may be coming, but it won’t be in Moscow.

            That is the only language they can understand.  Unless and until they have a strong fear of the populace, absolutely nothing will change(other than getting worse).  The longer it is put off, the more intense their language will have to be.  Already it is close to impossible to move around without being filmed and identified.

            I think not. Europeans are a tired, defeated people. (The western and northern ones, anyway.) There might be pockets of orneriness but that will be the extent of it. The Yellow Vests and the marches for Tommy Robinson is all we’re getting.At least the Chinese students in 1989 had the good sense to occupy a national monument for weeks to be mowed down by their own government, which turned China and the CCP into a pariah state. (In fact, it did reform the CCP in the long term.) Unfortunately it will take that kind of tragedy to get Europe rustled enough for reform.

                    While we have the same rot Europe does, and a bad immigration situation, it is not as thorough, and could be reversible. There is no Tom Homan in Europe, for example. No Stephen Miller. No JD Vance. There aren’t millions of center-right men posing with firearms and ATVs and voting for the Party that says “F You” to the establishment. And I can pretty much say what I want without being visited by the POLIS.

            Severian,I’m not sure if you were aware but late last summer time here in the UK, a youth (yes, youth – no colour) stabbed three little girls and killed them. It was an act of evil. He was actually sentenced to 52 years (I’d have hanged him, myself). And, so goes the familiar story these days, he was “known to police”.Anyhow, the point was that spontaneously, in many parts of the country white men (of a certain background) made their anger known. This happened in many towns and counties of Angloland. Whilst the violence was not organized, I remarked on it to my grandfather as a real surprise. Those whites had a backbone. They’d had enough.So I think your statement about organized populist violence is an accurate one. What we had was spontaneity, not organization, but it was something.And, as custom dictates, Mohammedan violence against the English continues. So, the question perhaps is more one of ‘when’ rather than ‘if’.

                The Southport murders, yes? I’m glad to see that the young man received justice. I follow the UK tabloid press. Credit where due: the UK’s justice system moves many times faster than ours, whether for serious crimes (the stabby incident aforementioned) or relatively minor stuff, like WrongThink: An excellent example is UK’s harsh (by our standards) censorship. For those not aware, you can be visited by the police for a “non-crime hate incident” which I admit I don’t know what that is. If it’s not a crime, why are the cops wasting their time? A Brit who posts the wrong thing on social media runs the risk of no-shit jail time, up to a few years, for (I think the terms are) “incitement to hate” or some such. They are seriously considering making criticism or offense to Islam a criminal offense too. Yes, a return of blasphemy laws! Many other nations in EU are not much better off. We in the States should hug our 1st Amendment; we can say stuff online that, save for very limited exceptions, is protected speech that might get us suspended or kicked off a system, but fined or jailed nope.

            Severian:“I wonder if Europe isn’t much closer than we think to actual, organized populist violence.“A lot of people believe that’s why The Council of the Sanhedrin decided Trump [rather than Biden] would be the President in 2025; that The Council realized the lid was about to blow [catastrophically] off the top of the kettle, and The Council needed to back off, so as to calm down the more hot-headed factions amongst the Goyim.The Council couldhavejust as easily told Phuckerberg to keep printing &amp; signing infinite fake ballots, and stuffing them in infinite fake ballot boxes, thereby stealing the 2024 election, just like he stole the 2020 election.Plus there’s the specter of October 3rd hanging over the Council, and the fact that “Somebody” conveniently turned off Iron Dome and allowed the Muslims to fly their lawnmower Air Force into The Chosen Land.And, finally, The Council has to confess that they badly misunderestimated Mother Russia’s determination to retain Khazaria for Herself.Will Bibi ever face the firing squad for having turned off Iron Dome?Or do the Chosen People have an entirely different morality when it comes to questions of utilitarianism?[Meaning who gives a flying yarmulke about what happens to a bunch of useless bums &amp; drug addicts at a sh!tty third-rate music festival, if you can manipulate the result to suck another several hundred billion out of the Goyische Federal Reserve?]

        I find it amusing that Merz wants to “ramp up the military” given the dismal state of the Bundeswehr no thanks to the devastation left by Ursula von der Leyen. Like most politicians, including Trump to some degree, they have no real clue how industry works.They think they just start throwing tax payers money around and ships, tanks and planes appear as if by magic.  Clearly they have no concept of just how deindustrialized Germany and Europe have become. If they started building one right now, it would approximately two years just to produce a new Leopard 2 battle tank. From those numbers alone, it doesn’t take too long to figure out how long a new missile cruiser or submarine will take. I suspect 10-years wouldn’t be far off the mark given what limited ship building capabilities we actually have.Despite the best of German industrial capabilities, we can thank the Greens for an energy policy that has devastated our economy resulting in large areas of industry being moved elsewhere. The hay-days of selling industrial machines and expensive cars to China are long gone. Higher energy costs will make total costs even higher than they should be so once again, we pay twice as much and get half what we need.Of the 200-billion earmarked for defense spending, we can expect roughly 45% of that will be spent on operation and maintenance, 25% on personnel, 20% in procurement with the remaining 10% on other aspects of keeping things running.The other elephant in the room is manpower. Germany used to have a six-month compulsory military service which existed from 1956 until 2011 for all males 18-years and older. As anyone who has been in the services knows first hand, six months of enlistment does not a military make. It’s just not possible to train mechanics and technicians in order to develop the technical competence required to service and maintain todays advanced military hardware.Of course European microprocess production is simply unable to meet demand either. The UK and many other Europeans have failed to invest in industrial technology and what they did focus on was primarily for the automotive sector.Add to the fact Germans are still very anti-military and those who have served even as far back as 20-yars ago, had trouble finding work in the German economy as they are stigmatized by their service record. I don’t mean your common infantryman, I’m talking about qualified engineers who might have been officers had trouble finding work in German industry after leaving the German military.Then there’s the simple fact NATO doesn’t work without the power, technical excellence and professionalism of the US military. There is no question the Americans have THE finest military in the world.  Those of us who have had the opportunity to live near them have developed wonderful friendships.Given the European track record during the past 50-years, I’m not convinced Germany or the EU is in any shape to ramp up much of anything, especially a standing army to go toe -to-toe with some imaginary enemy.When EU technocrats aren’t crying in public because of hurtful American words they’re mocking Trump because he wants to put America first. The only thing the EU has put first over the past decade are twenty-nine million immigrants.

            What amazes me is no one is talking about how German car makers are mow accelerating their push to move production to North America and Mexico. About 30% of all “German” cars now sold in North America are built in North America. This is growing quickly. Both BMW and Mercedes are expanding their facilities in Mexico. It will not be long before Germans cars are designed in Germany, but made overseas.
This should be a great shame, but it is ignored, even by the dissidents as far as I can tell.

                Well, building cars is manual labor. The elites hate manual labor. They ship our work overseas, cut our pay, and then say that we need the helots to do what we won’t do. But in this particular case, the elites hate the German work ethic and they fear what Germans do when they work. This predates Mustache Man and this Anglo suspicion of the German is probably the primary cause of the 20th century.

                        Indeed. This video of BMW’s Spartanburg, SC plant show how few human beings are involved in assembling a car these days:

Human beings are here and there to inspect the robot’s work (and maintain them).
Humans also show up to do delicate assembly work robots cannot do (or it’s cheaper to hire a human).

                        Yes, but still an employment opportunity that beats most others. Additionally, the supply network involved needs to be added in.
The way to judge this is number of man hours per car.  Today, typically 20-30.  In the 90’s, 40-60.  That a tremendous savings, but still not an insignificant gain from off shoring returning.
My general fear is that all these “moves” are not going to occur, but rather pledges that are 5+ years into the future for production facilities.  There needs to be teeth put into these pledges such that they are not reneged upon as soon as administrations change.

                            Even if it was 1, they would rather some third world migrant was doing that work instead of a European man, especially if that European man was getting paid a good wage and using it to take care of his European wife and kids.I don’t know why people get so bogged down in the details sometimes. This is how it is. They don’t want Germans living a healthy middle class lifestyle through industrial labor anymore than they want us to do it. Actually, probably less. It was surely a source of constant annoyance for them that Germany became what it did post-WW2 through industry and labor, and it is surely thrilling that the Germans were willing to execute the Morgenthau Plan on their own and voluntarily after their pipeline was blown up.

That car was built like a battleship and up until its demise, I never had an issue with components rattling, or coming loose.The only issue I had with the car was the suspension. It was too soft and I had the European springs put on it that lowered it by 3/4 of an inch all the way around. That made all the difference, after the swap, it handled perfectly.

                            I live in a small FL city. One day I was eating at the local DQ (formerly Dairy Queen) and saw a black female in her work uniform go out to a parked BMW. She didn’t go anywhere. No biggie, say I, I did the same thing too sometimes when I was on break. What piqued my interest was the cost angle: How does a young woman making minimum wage afford a BMW? My evil racist mind imagined likely scenarios. The car belonged to, or was a gift from her boyfriend the drug dealer, perhaps. When I left, I noted the model # (3xx series, I can’t recall exactly). When I got home I looked up what such a car would cost. It was an older model and they could be had well under $10K. So it was probably hers. Also, the cute animal bumper sticker suggested that, too.I hope she enjoys it. Reliable or not, those repairs are gonnacost.

                It’s ironic that Germany is voluntarily following the 1948 Morgenthau Plan to de-industrialize, depopulate, and become almost entirely agricultural….and dragging much of Europe and the UK along with it..

                Audi has been building in Hungary, Italy and Spain for years.
And of course they passed on the savings of lower labor and energy costs to their customers.
– said no one at Audi ever!
The majority of automation (robots) in automotive assembly is generally limited to chassis/frame and body builds. Anything that requires complex dexterity will continue to be done by hand because humans are simply better at fine motor skills and are also cheaper than a robot for installing power cables, small snaps, clips, etc.

                    Look, my old Toyota truck—the best ever produced by the industry—was built in Tennessee by American “hicks”.  It can be done!  It’s not only design, but quality control.  If German cars went downhill, then it’s one or both of these factors—not the employees on the line.

                    Very true.  There are any number of YouTube videos showing their assembly lines.  The interesting part is towards the final assembly end.  All the hand work being done to the cab and dash board.  Heck, my new trunk—currently in assembly is no longer on a conveyer, but rather parked side by side with a dozen other’s while workers scramble from truck to truck added the final touches.

                There’s definitely a totally unfounded belief that “We did it before; we’ll do it again.”  Totally ignoring the fact that there is no longer any ‘we.’  Even if I cared about buying “American” any more, I couldn’t do so.  The ‘workers’ here – especially the under 40s – are all non-White.  And merely putting together something actually manufactured elsewhere does not qualify as ‘industry.’  Hell, China makes 70% of ‘our’ apple juice (with a good helping of nasty chemicals).  Not to mention all the steel and rivets etc. will bend  – the question is whether before or after the girl bosses crash the plane/ship.

                    Karl,Indeed it ended badly for the Germans. But their record of achievements in various fields from 1933 to 1945 stands for itself. Of course, it resulted in almost total destruction, but: I have never, in all the history books I’ve read, seen it said that the Germans were generally incompetent or lacked endeavour in that period.Praising Moustache Guy’s boys has gone out of fashion, but organizing industry at such a scale and innovating in so many ways was no mean feat. In fact, you might well say that only a white nation could do it!The Germans went toe-to-toe with all European powers: both Western and Eastern. They extended their reach into the ore fields of Sweden and in Norway. I think that the Waffen SS were sent on a bit of R&amp;R to take Greece because the Italians couldn’t do it.As an organizational unit, the war machine of 1933-1945 Germany (and I say ‘war’ machine from 1933 onward, because that was really what it was geared up for) was probably one of the wonders of the modern world.I should actually read Heinz Guderian’s work about his time as a Panzer dude, because he apparently had choice words for AH when he wanted things like this:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzer_VIII_Maus.And what of this:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landkreuzer_P._1000_Ratte

                Correct. Further, industrial production was able to be ramped up for WWII in large part due to idle, pre-existing factories that were shuttered or barely used due to the Great Depression. The idea that there was a mass expansion of factory capacity then is in part exaggeration. The Rust Belt has been a state-imposed disaster for more than a half century now. A great many factories were under-utilized/unused for about 13 years prior to the outbreak of the Second World War. This is NOT replicable today.

                    Great points about the under used factories prior to WW2.
The US also had a highly skilled and motivated labor force to work in those WW2 factories.
Now, there is no comparable workforce in the US because the state has spent 50 or 60 years actively destroying American industry.

            Excellent stuff Karl. The issue of Euro defense infrastructure is mind boggling. Even if you could build these factories, they are obviously vulnerable to hypersonic missiles and would be blown up by the Russians Day 1 of any conflict. So they would have to be built underground and dispersed. Cost: massive. Air defense: almost completely dependent on US technology. Drone technology will take years to develop. And ISR is essential to defense and requires space/satellite technology. France has some but is way behind. This would cost a fortune alone. This is a generational process.

            The deranged belief that production can be ghost danced back to reality is not confined  to Germany or Europe. Regardless of how professional the contemporary United States military may be, and at best it is severely diminished, the material required to fight a war is not available at scale and has not been for a long time. The Ukraine War flushed out what paper tiger militaries comprise the West; daily propaganda about Russia running out of weapons ran up against the reality of Europeans and Americans unable to produce any. It was beyond parody when the West seemed to believe China would make up for the shortfall due to…reasons. The money is there. The products are not.

            “As anyone who has been in the services knows first hand, six months of enlistment does not a military make.”I’ve always been a fan of required service—even if less than a year.  It’s not been tried, even here in the USA.  Obviously expensive, however there may be benefits to offset such.  Such benefits may extend to NATO as well.For one, there is a reluctance to join on the part of a great many men simply from the novelty of the transition from civilian life.  Six months between the transitional period of HS to college/first employment, is less unsettling.  Six months to learn some basic life skill and self discipline is more than adequate and useful in life.  No, it won’t be enough for most of the MOS’s needed in the military, but enough for some self improvement and understanding of the traditional military ethos (assuming we get back to that someday).  When 75% of today’s young men are already considered ineligible for recruitment, can we do worse?From this lot we may evaluate a large swath of young American men’s potential and make offers to those willing and able at the 6 month mark to continue on in a military “career”.

                Actually we had the choice to either serve in the military or perform social services like working in hospitals, old age homes, local emergency services, etc. It was a huge benefit to the hospitals as they got free labor who did a lot of the very low level work and took that off the already short handed nurses and medical staff.

            Two comments on the German military and NATO.  Six months is a ridiculously short time to train.  Just enough to get through basic and AIT.
I was close friends with an US Army infantry colonel who was working with NATO in Afghanistan.  He said they were all worthless except the US military.
I have always considered the US and unserious country, but it turns out the Euros are worse than us!

            They think they just start throwing tax payers money around and ships, tanks and planes appear as if by magicPoliticians, finance people, and economists all suffer from this delusion. You might call it the Earl Grey Hot delusion. Remember how Capt. Picard would always order his favorite tea from the replicator by saying “Earl Grey, hot” and, thousands of light-years from the nearest tea tree, a steaming cup of tea would appear. In the world these people inhabit money has the same magic power as Picard’s words. There’s no boring, dirty, expensive production process, no industry to nurture over time, no workers to train, no supply chains to manage, money just turns magically into physical objects.This may also explain the Western political establishment’s thinking that spending hundreds of billions of dollars on wunderwaffen would automatically defeat Russia. The smart people here should be taking note of the fact that Russia, spending far less, has withstood the best military hardware the West had. It might be time to reassess the effectiveness of those weapons too.

        I think with the British, especially what used to be the English upper class, there is an old cultural force holding them back from a Trumpish figure, and it’s the same reason why they never got a Napoleon or Hitler or even a DeGaulle, and why they would never vote for an alpha like Trump. The native Brits don’t like cocksure despots; they prefer modesty, prudence, and deference married to erudition and wit and a fondness for things always being a little bit shitty. Anyone who visited a higher-end hotel in London in the 1980s knows what I’m talking about.This makes them terrific social companions but terrible nation builders. They find comfort in things not being “great”. Americans, the white ones anyway, love “great”. The Chinese and Middle Easterners love “great”. The Germans and French did, at one point. Russians, kinda. South Asians? I think they literally and figuratively like it shitty, which is probably why they so easily set up shop in the Yookay.It is ironic that the English live on Great Britain, but I think they’d tell you that “great” means large or prime in that context, which in itself is being terribly self-effacing and English. So I think Farage is the perfect English “revolutionary” for a feeble people. Cromwell is not coming back any time soon.

            They have an inbred suspicion of the Self-Made Man and a tremendous need for social consensus. This works when the Upper Class is vital, confers approval on talented upstarts, enforces standards and forges consensus. When the Aristocracy decays and the monarchy has been broken, it doesn’t work. Machiavelli discusses this in Discourses on Livy.

                This is correct. The class system is still alive and well. They will grudgingly admire Americans but think we’re “Cowboys”. I lived there in the late 60’s and the nation was still whole, though teetering from communist (socialist) takeover of the unions. Now I’m afraid the EU and immervation have done for them.

        The UK is a special case.The rich there are foreigners and hedge-fund managers. When London becomes Delhi, they’ll just move.Farage represents the “Benny Hill” generation which is slowly fading away. The young have Tommy Robinson types. But they’re completely shut out of politics. Meanwhile the King has a music podcast and celebrates Ramadan. The local Elite have obviously surrendered. The UK is finished.Continental Europe is very different. In France, Spain, Germany and Italy, the Elites are actually locals. So the Right has more traction and conservatism is growing among young men. The women are clearly the major problem. But I think there’s still hope and Zman is spot-on here.

            “When London becomes Delhi, they’ll just move.”
They already are. That’s why it’s so difficult to sell a decent property in London right now — there are no takers. Something is seriously wrong with your economy if it’s running on real estate speculation in the greater London area. It’s the foreigners who have been driving up property prices in London and thus keeping the pound strong. Now that’s gone. And Starmer is being portrayed as Churchill. It beggars belief.

            It seems completely insane that the British people are still so damned proud of resisting the Germans during WW2, while watching their nation being overrun by brown and black savages today. The Brits literally gave their women to these cretans while applauding Churchill. I simply cannot wrap my head around this. And by extension, the Europeans say they fear a Russian invasion, yet invite the African/Muslim hordes into their nations to ravage their women and children. Europeans are not worth defending because they will not defend themselves.

                Merkans are no better – always so proud of Dad/Grandad/Uncle who fought in WWII.  So they chose violent, rapey, alien savages instead of the ‘horror’ of speaking German.  We did the same thing, and are further along in the population replacement agenda.  And while some of it was homegrown we funded and pushed Europe’s diversity lunacy hard.  Yes, Macron and Starmer are embarrassments, but we had a senile lying moron as our own supreme leader, and our congresscritters are just as bad as their MPs.

        ‘In the 2016 election cycle, the majority of the American people signaled that they were done with the ideological politics that had reigned since the Cold War’You’re declaring victory in a war that barely has begun.  A few blows against the easiest target — trans athletes — and so forth is not victory.  Plucking low-hanging fruits.  :O)The high voltage of U.S. politics is its sacred cow, the feminist movement, which still dominates your schools, colleges, media, corporations, courts. churches and (yes) government.  Armed and funded to the teeth.  Nobody in the Glorious Trump Administration has even MENTIONED that there is a third rail; they seem to be hoping that everybody just pretends its nonexistence.The Left and Right both are extremely fond of Big Feminism, and addicted to the privileges, empowerments, and ‘special rights’ it infers on half the population.  Parents of daughters LOVE them some feminism, as it is dollars in the pocket and a ready-made leg-up in all of life.You ain’t won nothing.  Not even a popular plurality, because feminism is the very heart and soul of the ‘ideological politics’ you cite, and it’s still quietly beloved.  It is going quite strong and shows no sign of defeat, nor even of particular concern.

                Felix pointed out long ago that Farage’s main purpose was to gatekeep and destroy the British National Party, which was in fact becoming a thing at one point. Farage truly wants to be a Cool Kid and has no core, and this made him a valuable asset for those who saw him as a useful Judas goat. Americans suffer from the same cognitive dissonance, of course, but their economic elites became frightened and took their foot off the gas slightly. This has not happened in Britain and may not happen even though it remains far better situated demographically than the United States.

                    Jack,I believe that Felix’s contention was indeed correct. The BNP, which was really quite a fringe outfit at one time, pulled in around one million votes in the 2000s. This was around the time that the party’s then leader, Nick Griffin, went on the BBC showQuestion Time, in what even other leftists admitted was just one big roast.In any case, I remarked to my father the other day that I haven’t voted for so long, as I don’t think any of them are worth it. Griffin’s BNP was the only one, in my time, that I would have (and did) vote for. At the time they were gaining momentum, you could see the establishment getting a bit antsy. After the BBC thing, many seemed to be more sympathetic to Griffin, given the treatment he had got. Perhaps that alarmed them further.I’m not sure of the party’s line now, but at that time they were a party who believed that the white man was in serious danger in his own land, and that that danger came chiefly from multiculturalism pushed by leftists.It was an astute observation from Felix, and I remember it well, so felt compelled to write this response when you brought it up.

                        Thanks. I did not have enough information to evaluate Felix’s thesis, but it at least seemed plausible to me at the time. In recent months, given Farage’s obvious sabotage of even soft British nationalism, it has become obviously true. Even if Farage is acting merely, out of ego and being guided in a certain direction, he has become controlled opposition.

                            Jack,I suspect that privately, over a pint, Farage would find common ground with all of us here. But I’m afraid that publicly he seems to me to have become more moderate, probably because of the reasons Z mentions.Farage was of course far more presentable than Nick Griffin of the BNP, the latter being linked not just to violence but violent groups. Of course Farage got called a racist, which as we all know is par for the course, but he seemed pretty clean cut as far as rightist politicians go.He also had charisma. Which was something that I thought Griffin himself seemed to lack, and is something that goes a long, long way in politics.But you’re bang on: he is likely controlled opposition as he’s been at the trough for too long.I wish that we had a statesman like John Enoch Powell back. He was such a class act. Such a class act. Indeed, Powell made a huge sacrifice with regards to his career after his 1968 speech about immigration.That sort of bloke comes around once every hundred years, I guess.

                                Men like Powell are exceedingly rare anytime, anywhere, but his abandonment should have been the canary in the coalmine. Pat Buchanan was somewhat similar here, although the better analogy was Sam Francis even if he remained confined solely to the thought and communications realms. Francis was a genius and also marginalized in a way at least as harsh as what happened to Powell.In fairness to Farage, he was the public face of Brexit, which was a monumental achievement primarily for, in my opinion, its exposure of the totalitarian impulses that had gained currency. He is indeed a charming man but if we shared a pint I would be most guarded about what we discussed. Again, it may not be his actual intent but he his effect has been to gatekeep, which has been achieved largely via his ego.

        “The problem is most obvious in British politics. The Economist had acoverfeaturing British Prime Minister Keir Starmer as Winston Churchill. The motivation behind it is the British elites are still suffering from the 1938 disease that used to rage in the United States until the antidote of the 2024 election.”The problem with Britain has been that the elite lives in the imperial past, when Britain was a world-straddling empire and where it once took five months before it condescended to respond to an American missive. Even now I think that at the end of each annual Tory Party conference they all sing “Rule Britannia!”The first jolt with reality after WW2 came with the Suez Crisis, when Eisenhower picked up the phone and told British PM Anthony Eden, “I don’t know what you’re doing but I can only presume you’ve gone out of your head”, and threatened sanctions against both Britain and France. This cut them down to size. The official line since then has been that, okay, we’re not top dog anymore but we’re pals with the one who is (the USA) and we have a “special relationship” with that power. When the Americans think about it at all, this claim has them in stitches.So, Britain today. It lives in a state of genteel poverty and one which becomes worse by the day as other than dwindling North Sea oil it has no means of sustaining itself. The big cities — London, Birmingham, Manchester, Bradford — don’t look English at all but look like cities in the Indian subcontinent. Everything that could be sold off has been sold off — the railways, the water, electricity, Royal Mail, and these days the NHS is dribs and drabs. Yet the living in fantasy remains, perhaps all the stronger because there is nothing else.Oh, and I failed to maintain their condescension towards the Americans — who just don’t have the “culcha” the Brits have. “We shall be Greeks towards their Romans”, Macmillan used to say about 70 years back.

        Farage has shown his true colors. The Met Police are investigating suspended chair Rupert Lowe for “threats” against the Goldman Sachs Sri Lankan co-chair of the Reform Party. Yes you read that correctly.
Surprised there is no mention of Lowe here. Farage is finished after this. He is in bed now with the same people as Cameron and the rest. He got his seat at the table.

            Mark Carney is the next Prime Minister of Canada. What strikes me as odd is he reportedly has never served in any elected office. He does have an impressive resume, if by “impressive” you mean a credentialed WEF elite type. One blogger has called him a globalist’s globalist. Harvard AND Oxford. Prior Governor of the Bank of Canada AND the Bank of England straight afterwards. And he worked at Goldman Sachs among many other stops on the route to the top. Amazingly, he’s apparently not Jewish although few details are given about maternal side, but “Three of his four grandparents were Irish”. He is a practicing Catholic.(Source: Wikipedia).

        Western Europe is lost. That isn’t to say that there isn’t anything that will slow the slide or reverse it. However men can’t generate enough votes to get real populist in power even if there were any.Europeans are deathly afraid of being called nazis and pride themselves on being civil. They also pride themselves on not being civil to bigots who want the heritage population to remain dominant.Some euro men will whine about rape but European women hate the whiners not the invader rapists.As Romania shows, the East still has some fighting spirit. Whether it will last or is sufficient we shall see.At least they still have football and that is what matters to European men.

            The right-wing Romanians I see talking about it online are disgusted with right-wing Americans for thinking that outlawing right-wing electoral victory is a big deal. They buy the premise that any “populist” right—any right the people support and the regime doesn’t—isper seillegitimate and presumably Russian. If arresting them all is what it takes to make the people stop voting like American idiots, that’scompletely normalandnothing is happening. The zacusca tastes no different today.
Our fantasies of the Based East are total bullshit.

                Getting stirred up about Romanian politics is a bit like getting stirred up about Ukrainian politics;  We don’t understand what’s going on, and it’s none of our affair anyway.
That having been said, outlawing a candidate with 41% popular support is a bit like telling me I can’t vote for Trump.  FTS.

        Europe should be able to recover someday because it’s still full of white people. But if they do get their fighting spirit back let’s hope they don’t waste it fighting each other again.  However, back during the Cold war too many of them thought the USSR was the moral equivalent of America. I regret that we had to save those folks.

        I’m a resident of the garbage Island and started reading this article with the expectation that I would find fault with some of the observations made because  Zed man is too far away to have an accurate insight into the political scene in the UK. However, I cannot find fault with any of the points made in the article, this is absolutely spot on – a very accurate summation of the political/establishment regime in the UK.

        There is a viral video now on the internet from Ukraine. It shows the camera view of an FPV drone deftly maneuvering on a battlefield while pursuing a squad of soldiers running across a field. As the sound of the drone alerts the men to its presence, they disperse randomly and zigzag apart running as fast as they can. The last image from this drone is a shot of a soldier’s buttocks about 6 inches away. There are now thousands of skilled operators of this type of drone, which are easy to build and ubiquitous. Now add cheap AI facial recognition/autonomy, and you don’t even need an operator. This is no trivial development.

            Imagine a future where we are ruled by AI and government service is a kiosk…because it’s too dangerous for politicians to appear in public except in sealed armored cars.
Worse: home anti-drone defense systems.
Worse yet: When drone warlords rule, it’s too dangerous to go out on the streets unless you belong to that block’s tribe.

        Much as I detest the EU, the common currency and other agreements make it possible for the US to exit NATO.  Sign bilateral agreements to allow US military planes and ships to land/dock/refuel.The end of the tariff imbalance removes the Marshall Plan, effective 4/2. That will further the goal of getting the US out of these entanglements.  Tariff reciprocity will also end the subsidy of their suicidal climate change policies and social welfare programs.  Suddenly, the balance sheet is tilted against European misadventures.The result might actually be a stronger, self-sufficient, Europe.  Their worst policies are subsidized by American defense spending and trade imbalances.  Green energy is a luxury item.  Population replacement is a luxury good, too.And that’s before Trump works out some sort of trade deal with Putin.

        I was picking up what you were putting down. Trump 1.0 was someone who wanted to be accepted (let Hillarity go) and got years of lawfare pointed at him. He had deep enuf pockets to withstand it and became vengeful. I’ve no idea about the net wealth of Farage (google sez $4 million). Money talks I suppose…

            Farage is ~ my age. Brits of our generation were raised to be affable and clubbable so they could go to the City and make money. I’m American, but I’ve met hundreds of Brits in finance just like him. Guys like this just don’t lead revolutions. He did a lot of good but his race has been run. He was a generational talent, but can’t transcend his generation.

        What is happening in Washington is both revolutionary and just the startkryptos doesn’t think so. What’s interesting about this time is the amount of cool stuff I would never have been exposed to like jaque ellule andAugusto del Noch; according to kryptos,  these two seem to think the overall set up to society is explicitly anti Christian and anti family: ellule from the perspective of “technique” or efficiency and noch from the perspective of annihilating the past and tradition and especially the family . So that no matter who is in office nothing can really change. Both progressives and conservatives are part of the same force. Both progressives and conservatives are about keeping revolutionary forces at bay.at least that’s what kryptos says:https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/seeking-the-hidden-thing-podcast/id1689961277?i=1000698562636

            Trump said it today, and I think he means it: “51st State!”
So, we wanted to end the war in Ukraine, and start one with Canada…
Realistically, he might offer them the Crimean option.The West would go for liberation, and the East might come for the gibs.
p.s.- Greenland votes tomorrow on what is called “their most historic vote.”
p.s.s.- what if we end up with a divided 2 North Americas, in the end?Split vertically this time, instead of laterally.*glares across the Mississippi, shakes fist*

        You so rarely mention Nigel, I never get to share myextreme-, ultra-, radical-, far-righttake on him with the boys. So, here:
Farage of England, Poilievre of Canada, and Vance of America are the same local character, sufficiently professional tosound right—right enough to hold the corner of power they’ve been given—but their only true feeling/value is genocidal hatred of loser whites, and that’s the only cause they have ever or ever will advance.
They’re the three worst people in the world (of politics).

            They are all meant as safety-relief valves, to prevent the rise of genuine blood and soil nationalism.  But, of course, so many here still have strong civnat tendencies that they will not accept this.  Why, we’re ‘winning bigly’ although it will not change the demographic implosion one iota.  Whites only retain the minimal power they have because of their share of the electorate (as little as elections and voting actually matter).  Every year old Whites die off and more blacks/browns/yellows come of age as magic paper ‘citizens’ and they vote and run for office.  By 2030 a few might start to notice, but essentially Whites will be done and unable to win almost any political race.  2040 is laughable.
