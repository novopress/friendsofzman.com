        Nothing has really changed at my house. We‚Äôve been living like this for a while. My business partner and I have been preparing for a recession for some time now. We are in construction. Remodeling, to be specific. My wife has been living what these women at the store were talking about. I don‚Äôt worry about much at home. My wife was/ is a bit damaged, she has the tattoos, she has the degree in criminal justice that she can never use‚Ä¶she has some thought patterns that are bad‚Ä¶but we‚Äôre doing good under the traditional system. She‚Äôs happy. We have 3 kids to keep her busy. I won‚Äôt say she‚Äôs ‚Äúfixed‚Äù but I will say that if she can find fulfillment, I hope to think some of the other ‚Äúmodern women‚Äù out there can too. So, fingers crossed that the virus scare puts that process in motion.

            Well, you‚Äôve saved her from something much, much worse.
Just make sure that you are always dominant and in control ‚Äì women like her sense a weak man and will jump to control you the moment they sense weakness.

            I‚Äôd always dreamed of dating a girl with long, slim legs, but I realized that I would only get one who had tattooed herself down to my level, LOL.
I found out that a lot of women do stuff like that because their lives seem empty and meaningless. And that having kids can fill that void. After two kids she turned into a basically normal person and caring mother, and her legs are still slim, praise the lord!
And it actually gives me a bit of street cred, LOL: ‚Äúhow did this mild-mannered nerd land that bad-ass-lookin babe?‚Äù

                It‚Äôs been said that the greatest act of ‚Äúconservatism‚Äù is to have a child.  The second is to buy a house.  Owning a home and producing children both anchors you into a community and gives you a stake in its continued health functioning.

            Amen to that, Brother.  I‚Äôm a chick and spent a few years testing Basic Husband. Discovered with time maybe his patterns might be beneficial for me. He‚Äôs been places and knows things. He has a big engineering brain and can make and do things that I cannot. Plus he doesn‚Äôt let me get away with disrespect! I finally realized to just treat him with respect and kindness. Did the trick! Harmony in the household. You men are delightfully simple and require few but fundamental qualities in marriage.Going for a nice and beautiful drive today here in Southern Utah up the mountain before the rain/snow tomorrow. We enjoy being in a small car space together.

        I have not watched a news show on TV since last Sunday.   That‚Äôs when I decided beside TDS the only thing the leftist media had to offer was pessimism, lies and a cover for the Red Chinese.  Did you know that ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù is a race?  I thought Asians were a race and Chinese were an ethnicity but according to the TV and the other media I was wrong.
So yes, Virginia Chinese food is now raaaaacist!

        ‚ÄúA lot of bad things will come from the great lock-down, but on the other side will be some good things too.‚Äù It‚Äôs by no means sure that bad things will outnumber the good things. If the China Virus puts an end to‚Äîor even a serious dent in‚Äîoligarchical globalism, the Deep State, and/or the endless wars of the military-industrial complex, the virus could turn out to be an enormous gift.

                Anything that would make people realize how stupid it is to pay thousands of dollars to have a ‚Äúprofessor‚Äù stand up and read from a book.  There has to be structure and degree verification to learning, but it‚Äôs amazing how far we have stayed from what is necessary.

        For years I‚Äôve been saying that families not eating together is a symptom of our degraded culture. (Thanks Theodore Dalrymple) Maybe that will be something that will change.  I‚Äôm definitely missing the NCAA hockey tournament, though.

            Agreed. If there‚Äôs one thing families should do, it‚Äôs eat dinner together. If you do that, a host of other things fall into place.
Reminds me when Paul O‚ÄôNeill became CEO of Alcoa. Instead introducing a host of new initiatives or talking p&amp;l, he laser focused on one thing: Worker safety numbers. He called it a Keystone Habit. Getting that right causes so many other areas follow suit.

            Amen Ganderson. The seemingly little things we have abandoned in the multitude of modernity-induced tradeoffs have had huge consequences.Interesting how all of the tech and convenience has failed to preserve the simple rituals of normal family life. In fact many have worked to install a new opposing order of things.I have been a supporter of the slow food movement for a long time ‚Äì even though it is wrought with globohomo leftists, the premise is sound.Growing a backyard bounty or even a few patio herbs and guarding meal prep and dining as a sacred family function goes a long way in grounding what is important and preserving space and time for communication and shared experiences.Dinner together is likely almost as significant in positive social outcomes as having the biological father in the home. Which of course is hateful to say out loud these days.

        Enjoy being able to go outside while you stil can;  Here in France walking in the forest, or on the beach, or swimming alone in the ocean, will lead to a fine.  And they‚Äôre using helicopters and drones to look for violators. I sneak along trails in the forest where near to where I live and avoid going into the open.  And every time you leave your home you have to carry a paper stating the reason why you‚Äôre out.  So far, I‚Äôve avoided the Health Gestapo.  People who have reason to know have told me German occupation was not this intrusive during World War II..

            Yes the silver linings need to be illuminated!A couple anecdotes to confirm mr. Z‚Äôs experience.A friend on the east coast called last night. Which made me realize how much more people are communicating since most are finding they suddenly have more time. A lot of meme spamming but also reconnecting.I had a beer over video conference with a few buddies. Lots of interruptions to show what the kids are up to, tour of backyard gardens, and a levity that belies the media‚Äôs constant death count obsession.Everyone seems more concerned about the economy and their livelihoods than the virus. All are pissed at their leaders. Most live in CA. Time will tell if any of this erodes their goodwhite tendencies.My friend on the east coast is working from home. His job is rather easy at the moment but he is now his two kids‚Äô (K and 1st grade) favorite teacher.He is exhausted and pretended to lament the toll of managing that much energy. But couldn‚Äôt last long before he admitted that he loves it.His kids don‚Äôt really know why things have changed but they have already adapted and so a win for him is they are excited for ‚Äúschool‚Äù and the AM process is no longer one of friction and separation but waffles and words.The end of constant sportsball is one of the best parts of this whole thing. My sports bro buddies, usually full of march madness and SportsCenter loops, are otherwise engaged.I went to a sporting golds store to look for dumbells. Late to the party. Sold out.Store was busy with young people looking for yard games, exercise equipment, and other toys to occupy their time. Small groups of friends together brainstorming over various items and the games they could invent.The neighbors bought a backyard trampoline for their two pre-teens. More dangerous than the virus. I take that as a good sign too. Lotsa children‚Äôs squeals in the neighborhood.I only wish spring came earlier. Here at elevation we have a protracted winter. The crocuses are up tho. And the air smells alive again.

        The two most positive changes I see that could come out of this is the diminishing of sports ball and hopefully a sea change in education.Re sports ball, the longer this lockdown continues the more of a chance that males will realize that a live that revolves around watching other men play is not really a life at all.Re education, could be a major paradigm shift.  As a recently retired teacher who taught first in the university system and then in the college system I know that the higher education scam is the biggest joke in the country. Administrators and FT tenured professors making obscene salaries and pensions while producing more and more worthless degrees and bankrupting both taxpayers and students.Seeing how quickly most institutions transitioned into online delivery mode and seeing the poor resulting product many of the teachers are half assing should wake up more than a few parents and students to seeking alternatives. At the minimum I hope to see the shutdown of many expensive private institutions. The public institutions will have a much better ability to weather the crises since here in CA the teachers unions run the state to a large degree. However I see/hope to see seismic changes there as well.

BTW, all of the professors who contribute atThe Orthospherewould agree wholeheartedly with your assessment regarding ‚Äúthe biggest joke in the country.‚Äù

        Hope you are right about the women, Zman, but I am not so certain.  You‚Äôd be amazed how many parents ‚Äì not merely airhead women but fathers as well ‚Äì have no clue what‚Äôs in their kids‚Äô textbooks.  First thing I asked when we were choosing between public/private for our older son was to look at the textbooks.  Christian schools it was no problem; public school immediately wanted to know ‚Äòwhy.‚Äô  And when/if the mass babysitting service/indoctrination centers start up again, most will again happily surrender their progeny, and the shaping of their minds and morals, to the state.Our lives have changed minimally because of all this ‚Äì I cannot go work out at the gym, but otherwise I still take care of our home, cook the meals, etc. just as I always have.  Your shopping experience was interesting but very different from mine.  I did some fact-finding stops yesterday and this morning, after taking my son to work.  We want for nothing, but if you need milk, eggs, bread, cold cuts, or any paper goods you‚Äôre out of luck.   Despite the notes about limits of ‚Äú1 each‚Äù on the shelves, said shelves were still totally empty.  (Perhaps if I hustled out at 7AM there‚Äôd be something, but I don‚Äôt plan on that right now).  Maybe they‚Äôre ensuring Lagos stays calm and are not as concerned about the DFW suburbs?Tip for fellow dissidents who have young kids ‚Äì try to find Fairlife long life milk.  I buy it at Krogers here in DFW (in the health bar aisle, top shelf ‚Äì not always easy to notice).  We‚Äôre not lactose intolerant, and it‚Äôs not cheap, but it‚Äôs higher protein/lower sugar than regular, and it lasts for months with no refrigeration.  My younger son, who is as picky as they come, tastes zero difference between it and regular.  It comes in a six pack of 8 oz bottles.  Pricey, but no waste (I was constantly dumping milk that had soured when I used to buy half gallons of regular).  Even if we were to use up everything else we have (and we‚Äôre months from that) we‚Äôd still have milk, peanut butter, and pancake mix.  Yesterday I bought some more jars of unsalted peanuts and cashews at Aldi.  No one need go hungry, but I will admit if I were a young mother the lack of toilet paper would have me worried.Best of health and wealth to all other dissidents ‚Äì truly wished we lived in a real community where we could help one another in real time.

            Hi 3g‚Ä¶.good to hear from you.  Great milk tip and wish I could nest in your pantry and eat your tasty food, but not now. Since I‚Äôm carnivore solely to keep my immune system nicely calmed down, I go on meat forays.  Hopefully, I don‚Äôt have to learn how to bring down a big elk at my age. Plus I am not staying cooped up. No sir.As squishy as Gov. Herbert is, a minuscule remnant of the ancestors still rumbles through his veins.

        There will be a window of opportunity to build on this teachable event and move people along in their awareness, but once some semblance of normalcy resumes, most folks are going back to revert to default settings.  Almost every aspect of the pandemic and response reinforces the case for ethno-nationalism and undermines the case for globalism.

            Exactly.  Same appears here on a State level.  Rep‚Äôs want to direct funds at unemployed, but especially at keeping businesses viable for future employment.  Dem‚Äôs want to increase (permanently) welfare programs.  They can‚Äôt help themselves when the piggy bank is broken open.Always the same song and dance.  Increase the needy, then increase the welfare to such.  Wash, rinse, repeat.  Even the teacher‚Äôs union is balking at plans to partake in remote instruction for students at home.  Concern is that they might be working longer hours, albeit they now are receiving full salary for staying at home doing nothing.  So they want some type of ‚Äúovertime‚Äù pay provision‚Äîwhich does not even exist for normal working conditions as they are ‚Äúexempt‚Äù employees.

        That is one of the things I discovered along with the existence of my Maker a few years ago. Our little country chapel was a community. Kids were boisterous but behaved. When they weren‚Äôt ‚Äì you could nark at them and grump without some cunned stunt shrieking about you traumatizing her baby ‚Äì chances are the offender would get a cuff upside the head from mom too. And the women ‚Äì my goodness, they are such beautiful creatures in their Sunday finery! They‚Äôre warm and caring and a pleasure to be around. It was like slamming a gallon of cool water after a long run.It used to be that the communal tradition extended beyond the church‚Ä¶ but then the Exceptions took charge and they will have nobody but themselves to blame for their coming demise. Not only will girl politics dry up and blow away as if it never existed ‚Äì a lot of the weirdos will too‚Ä¶ and that will be a good thing. There is good in everything.

On Sunday we see a huge community of whites, many white couples with large families. It‚Äôs beautiful to see so many white children. And being allowed to roam without their parents bitching non-stop ‚Äì if they get out of hand the punishment will be more severe though, as you illustrated.The left is gunning for evangelical Christians ‚Äì we are the most hated group ‚Äì white AND socially conservative (and also not really libertarian or fiscally conservative).I‚Äôm on high alert for (((subversion))) though‚Ä¶ and unfortunately it‚Äôs even making inroads in these communities. Be aware.

        Damn good post, Sir! You wrote:Something I thought about as I was leaving is that suddenly the status hierarchy for women has changed. The mom I was chatting with was feeling really good about taking control of her household. Suddenly, the women taking care of their kids, taking over their schooling and being a stabilizing force are cool. Those career women sheltering in place with their box wine and social media account can no longer kid themselves about their real status in society.There‚Äôs been a lot of wishful thinking about a baby boom coming from this lock-down, but what may follow is a marriage boom. Millions of single women now have no reason to exist, because they are stuck at home. They can‚Äôt cause drama at work and they can‚Äôt cruise the bars with their friends. Meanwhile, the women they made sport of at the office are having the time of her life at home with the family. There‚Äôs some chance this panic opens some pretty young eyes to the reality of their existence.Bingo! Couldn‚Äôt have said it better myself if I tried. I‚Äôve said elsewhere that this is one of several ‚Äúsilver linings‚Äù to all of this craziness, and I‚Äôm loving every minute of it. Where I come from people are not in a panic even still. Other than the usual suspects, they haven‚Äôt been in a panic from the gitgo. But moms, as you iterate, seem to be, on the whole, not only ‚Äòtaking it all in stride,‚Äô but also they seem rather eager to get about the business of taking care of house and home, and educating their kids.We drove by one of the Indian ‚Äúgaming casinos‚Äù in Oklahoma the other day, and it did my heart good to see the parking lot empty. If I could bulldoze the place down and get away with it between now and when the scare is over and the economy rebounds, I would in the twinkling of an eye.

        Every time I think society has reached a bridge the public won‚Äôt cross, they dutifully get on the bridge and continue the mad march down the freeway of cultural destruction.Funny enough though, so far, every person who I have seen in public myself with a mask has been a black woman. It‚Äôs only been a few, but they have all been black females.I‚Äôm waiting for National Review to post the first articles about how conservative and right wing it is to wear masks in public.

        I hope you‚Äôre right Z. I‚Äôve been of like mind. But this thing is taking on a 9/11 feel. Might as well call it al qaeda virus.  Al qaeda virus and flat curvers.   And I don‚Äôt like saying that because being pessimistic isn‚Äôt good. Should probably take my own advice.All the same, I was in college on 9/11. My roommates and I broke out the grill. It was calming, normal. Lots of talking instead of video games or tv. It was good. Somewhere W was ranting to a faceless enemy about our missile systems.People know the game. Will they remember and snap out of it?

            9/11 was different, very different.  We were at war.  We didn‚Äôt know exactly who, or how large such would be.  Like Perl Harbor.  But we were at war and it was simply a time of getting together and organizing the appropriate response.  And we knew what that response should be as we‚Äôd done such time and again throughout our nation‚Äôs history.That‚Äôs the key here; organization, togetherness, united response.  Corona panic is different.  It‚Äôs an unseen enemy, but a known enemy.  The enemy is us; strangers in the street, neighbors, friends, even our children.  Our leadership‚Äôs response is to promote ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù‚Äîfurther reinforcing aloneness and its companion, despair.A true leadership would be talking to the public everyday about the strengths of the country and the future, post pandemic, as Z-man has done today.  But this is clown world and everyman is left to do ‚Äúwhat seems right in his own eyes‚Äù sans such leadership.  Are there enough of us left?

                Can speak to that first hand.  9/11 for many of us was a combination of survivor guilt and an immediate to rush to ‚Äúdo what we could do‚Äù.  My spouse had a new friend who just moved here from Hong Kong with a new baby, her husband was killed in WTC 1‚Äìand no family was within driving distance so she parked herself there to help out until the planes were flying.  Everybody was doing something‚Äìthere were 11 other families that lost people, so everyone rallied around.  This is more like the Sitzkrieg of 1940, waiting in our respective bunkers for an enemy that might or might not attack.  Don‚Äôt know when, don‚Äôt know where.

                So true.  It‚Äôs amazing how being alone for much of the time seems tolerable when it could be seen as a matter of preference or choice; but it morphs quickly into depressing loneliness when it becomes a matter of government diktat.  And the social isolation is made more toxic when my telephone calls to distant friends aren‚Äôt answered, even in response to a heart felt voicemail hoping that they are well and coping with this grand social experiment.  Today, Zman‚Äôs observations helped quell some of the bitterness I‚Äôve been choking on this past week.  Hope is not entirely crushed.  Be well everyone.

            Media-driven fear. People submitting to authority responding out of proportion to a real threat. A period of coming together in the aftermath. Lots of talk that the world has changed.

                It‚Äôs a safe assumption there will be a full court press to transition to a demand economy, which is what the Green New Deal is. We are watching governors and mayors grab power in unprecedented ways even now with little pushback and the demonization of anyone who doesn‚Äôt fall into line, hence the Most Evil People on Earth Are Springbreakers. The DOJ wants its police state tactics become explicit.
People realize this is over the top and comply for the most part. The odds favor these same people, when hungry, will obey harder.

                    Disclaimer: Trump supporter not worshipper here.Trump gives me tremendous optimism about this in spite of what looks to be going on.  It took a couple of years for questioning the 9/11 narrative to catch on. This one was born questioned. Intentionally or not, Trump is a coronavirus truther. If he‚Äôd gone along from day one it would be worse. Questioning 9/11 in 2001 was more dangerous than questioning this thing, on the ground level anyhow. People are much more receptive.The chances of a 20 year War on Health are practically nil. A few years at most‚Äî and the boomerang will be spectacular.  Certainly unnecessary, and possibly tragic‚Äî hopefully not tragic‚Äî but we‚Äôre in for the ride.  The sooner things turn around, the better it will be for everybody.  What will be will be.

                        ‚ÄúTrump supporter not worshiper here‚Äù ‚Äî me too, and my former admiration of him has been running on fumes lately.But credit where due: Trump has shown a needed confidence in his public response to the COVID-19 dragon. Concern, properly, but projecting strength.Churchill made serious mistakes in handling WWII strategy, but his demeanor stiffened British backbones and helped prevent widespread panic. Trump is looking like he might do something similar. He hasn‚Äôt always made the best moves, but has been no more confused than anyone else and gives the impression of learning ability.Setting a psychological tone as the crisis lengthens is important along with the medical punches.

            I wish I could believe the hype about how the coronavirus pandemic will ‚Äúchange everything‚Äù in terms of shocking our political, social, and economic elites out of their pattern of greedy, shortsighted, and ultimately self-destructive behavior, but I‚Äôm sorry, I simply don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm old enough to remember when 9/11 was going to ‚Äúchange everything‚Äù too, but it didn‚Äôt. I mean, it did for a couple of years, until the initial burst of emotion surrounding it faded, but in the long term, other than helping themselves to a few new tools of power, it didn‚Äôt change their behavior one bit. This won‚Äôt, either.Ten years after 9/11, we had twice as many Muslim immigrants in this country as we had the day before it. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if ten years from now, we do twice as much manufacturing in China as we did before this pandemic hit.That‚Äôs just the way it goes in corrupt, declining civilizations.

                This is what I‚Äôm saying. They couldn‚Äôt get socialism the ballot box, so they‚Äôre getting it by not letting a good crisis go to waste.  If we go this way, disrupting the economy and people‚Äôs lives every coronavirus season (as is being floated) eventually somebody will come along, correctly point out that we can‚Äôt go on this way, and propose death panels as a solution.  Worst case scenario.  Think Trump is Yang and Boomer Remover. Not just jokes if the opportunity came up.  It already sounds like we‚Äôre getting the free money.Best case people wake up fast. Realistically, it‚Äôll be somewhere in between.And btw Rush Limbaugh just won my respect.  Hadn‚Äôt listened in a while. The guy with lung cancer has guts go figure üôÇ

        Great post today, Z Man.  I‚Äôve had some similar thoughts and experiences.  I went on a date yesterday in Columbia, South Carolina, and we just walked and talked amid the full flower of spring in the South (which lasts about two weeks, then it‚Äôs summer‚Äìha!).  It was invigorating (and free!).We‚Äôve transitioned to online teaching at school, which has dramatically cut down on the superfluous fluff and b.s. that gobbles up the bulk of the typical school day.  I can get through in 20-30 minutes what would take an hour in class.  Working from home is a God-send, as I can roam about my half-acre in my rural Southern town, or walk to the local Main Street for provisions, fresh air, etc., and be back in time to answer any student queries.I hate that it took a global pandemic and a massive shutdown to do it, but I think we‚Äôre learning very quickly what matters, and what was just the accumulated dross and flotsam of our everyday lives.  I hope the economy comes roaring back and people in affected sectors can get back to work, but I‚Äôm also hoping we reevaluate some of the superfluity in our work lives.All said, I‚Äôm optimistic.  I‚Äôm trying to make the most of a bad situation; so far, that‚Äôs worked well.

        Instead, we committed ourselves to making one exception after another to accommodate a metastasizing number of weirdos, oddballs and trouble makers.
Amusingly, after decades of trying to sell us one shit sandwich after another by stamping ‚ÄúFreedom and Equality!‚Äù on the label, libertarians and the like-minded are shocked to find out that people are starting to take a dim view of freedom and equality. Now, who could have seen that coming?

            Freedom and equality would not go so quietly into that good night, if it wasn‚Äôt for the redefining of such.  Freedom is now defined as allowing every sort of deviance into the public square.  Such was never the case historically.  Freedom was always understood as the ‚Äúability‚Äù to exercise your ‚Äúliberties‚Äù‚Äîthose liberties being defined/codified by an ordered society for the ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù good, not the individualistic good.  Equality was always defined as ‚Äúequal treatment/consideration under the law‚Äù‚Äînot equality of outcome in the sphere of societal interaction.When these basic understandings are forgotten, freedom turns into little more than anarchy, and equality necessarily becomes despotism.  Why would anyone want that?

            They‚Äôll come out with a computer model that shows the ‚Äòreal‚Äô infection rate being whatever they want it to be. That‚Äôs how many infection rates are tracked today already. Easier than actually testing people. And a lot easier to juice the computer model.

        I don‚Äôt like that you‚Äôre so dismissive of mask wearing.  Part of the reason Chinese wear masks in public, and from my understanding this is a south China thing, Is that there are many terrible upper respiratory tract Infections such as unusually bad flu‚Äôs and sars etc. which brew in the primitive human and animal societies in Indonesia and spread upward into China.  It‚Äôs like a viral Petri dish, very dense populations in close proximity to animal reservoirs. Their various flu viruses tend to be a lot more severe and potentially lethal than the ones we face year to year.  This novel Coronavirus is a case of that.  I just hope ‚Äúglobalism‚Äù has not established us a new cultural norm with the South Chinese.

            Well, apparently, this virus is a droplet virus.  Therefore, masks alone won‚Äôt protect you from it.  You would also need a full face shield or goggles.  However, if you have it, wearing a mask could potentially protect others from getting it.

            Globalism in theory: Happy mixed couples eating tacos, racial and class lines erased, the best and brightest lifting the whole world out of poverty, bored wine moms can be fucked by exciting Middle Eastern and African vibrants instead of boring and sensible European men.
Globalism in practice: Worst of every culture spreads worldwide (ie. western homo/negro worship, Chinese diseases, mask wearing), low social trust, increased class divisions, racial hatred, best and brightest turn their talent towards short sighted profit making, white women raped by 3rd world savages.

        ‚Äúthere is an odd pleasure that comes from having to sacrifice and conserve.‚ÄùOne of the things I love about my wife is she is the most frugal person I know.  We make a game out of saving money.  People always thought we were rich because our kids grew up wearing designer clothes, not knowing my wife got them at Goodwill or on Craigslist for a few dollars per item, or from trading with other moms.  We are in our fifties and have saved enough to never need for anything, but we still time our restaurant visits for their half-off nights.For Valentines Day, we go to the card isle while we are shopping, carefully select cards for each other, exchange and read them, and then put them back on the shelf.  We then high-five each other for saving $15.  We both have our indulgences, but we always have an enjoyment/$ ratio in mind.‚ÄúBut godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it. But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that. People who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.‚Äù ‚Äì 1 Timothy 6:6-10.

        ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a lot of wishful thinking about a baby boom coming from this lock-down, but what may follow is a marriage boom. Millions of single women now have no reason to exist, because they are stuck at home. They can‚Äôt cause drama at work and they can‚Äôt cruise the bars with their friends. Meanwhile, the women they made sport of at the office are having the time of her life at home with the family. There‚Äôs some chance this panic opens some pretty young eyes to the reality of their existence.‚ÄùThere very likely will be a suicide spike among the past use-by date AWLF‚Äôs for this very reason, sort of the mirror image of white working class males killing themselves as they were rendered poor and impotent.

            It‚Äôs quite tragic that millions of (mainly white) women have been brainwashed into believing this trope since the 1970s.Also, childlessness affects women far worse than men. Men are also happier with a family but sometimes we just have to do what we have to do. Look at truckers, miners, pilots, etc. Even if they have a family they are away all the time.Anyways, women are the #1 victim of the women‚Äôs rights movement. Just like blacks are the #1 victims of the ‚Äúcivil rights‚Äù movement. We white men just keep on living and suffering. It‚Äôs better with a wife and in a homogenous society. But you just have to live, regardless.

                @UFO- great comments and observation; Many men such as I, were unable to find anyone or attract these career women at all- but life has to be lived- i miss a family at times like this and when you see people together- it just makes it worse but they are so fortunate, I wonder what will happen to all the older singles? At least i can give to those that promote nationalism and biblical marriage and relationships. Fantastic blog Z man- will be supporting you and the like minded.

        The curse of affluence in our modern nanny state is that most people never get to experience the joy and self-esteem they earn for themselves after running a gauntlet of hardship and emerging on the other side having vanished the threat and proven themselves worthy of their ancestral inheritance. We are descended from the survivors of hard-knocks and our DNA cries out to us to pass the baton based on deeds rather than virtue signaling.

        Those ladies are coming to the same realization I did about a year ago.With regard to homeshooling, my family is well enough off that we can afford the good private school in our area.  The kids who go there come from good families, and are definitely at the higher level of the IQ curve.Even so, it is absolutely shocking how little learning goes on in that school.  I watched in at a class where they were teaching words (Kindergarten).  They would have a sheet, be told the letters of a word then to writer it, and the teachers would walk around making sure it was done right. Total time actually working?  30 seconds a cycle. Total time dicking around waiting for a teacher to check your work? 2 minutes a cycle.Their time in Math didn‚Äôt look much better.  Tons of time spent learning numbers and they can only add with their fingers and count to 100 by the end of Kindergarten.  What the hell are they doing to spend on hour a day on math?On top of that, they have homework every night, in freaking Kindergarten.Spend 20 minutes a day teaching your kids to read, give them a Kumon book to practice math for 20 minutes, and give a simple penmenship book to practice for 5 minutes a day, and by the end of the school year you will have a kid working at the second grade level, at least.And you can pocket that extra 5k+.

            That‚Äôs an old story.  I had a department head in my early graduate days who fled from CA before coming there.  He was famous for a peculiar concept in education in those days, ‚Äútime on task‚Äù.  Seems he was the first to gain access to k through 12 classes with monitors whose sole job was watch certain students and how long they spent paying attention and also how long teachers spent ‚Äúteaching‚Äù during an instruction period.In those days, it was fashionable for State legislatures to address declining reading and math scores with mandates to extend class time in those areas, say from a 50 minute period to a 75 minute period.  His research basically showed that students were lucky to be spending 25 minutes of a class period actively engaged in the lesson, interruptions being what they were.So the brunt of his recommendations were more like an efficiency expert in a factory production line.  What came out of such I can‚Äôt recall.  Probably not much since CA was turning Brown and that really was the basic problem‚Äîwhich is not even admitted to today.

            Lol true. But to be fair, cat‚Äôs aren‚Äôt that aloof. Its just that most people have an inflated image of how interesting they are.Cats are highly intuitive and social. Just not in the obvious, vulgar way that dogs maintain their food supply chain. (I love dogs, so no offense to them)If a cat is aloof it is because the womyn is a selfish boor and the cat would rather spend the evening harvesting a furball it knows it will have to painfully eject under the couch later as opposed to enduring another awkward manic love-on-me session while the netflix rolls in the background. Plus cats dislike alcohol breath. Especially boxed wine.If those cats had office jobs they would be ‚Äúworking late‚Äù every night and volunteering for that conference on compliance at the omaha airport ramada too.

        Shouldn‚Äôt there be specified quarantines?It‚Äôs not as though our collective health rests on the same imperiled baseline. Younger men (especially) and women should be out working, with caution, while we protect the vulnerable using mandatory quarantines. Yes, social distancing is still a thing; regular sanitization is still a thing; gloves and masks are still a thing. But we *must* continue to produce.And you can‚Äôt just cut a check as compensation for depriving us of the experience of work. Because if you include the benefits of personal fulfillment and regular group socialization, sorry, but 1k isn‚Äôt enough. Some of us like our jobs and the people we work with.This nationwide shutdown is nonsense. Without an economy, we‚Äôll have little to which we can return.

            Equalitarianism forbids such rationality. As it stands now, there are 38,813 cases in the United States and 400 deaths per the CDC website. This is a mortality rate of .010 percent, which is an average flu. I am not optimistic the rate will hold, but to your point eighty percent and rising of the dead are 65 and up. The freak outs over younger adults going on spring break and gathering in Central Park are driven just as much by equalitarianism as concern they will spread the disease to parents or grandparents.

                A few suggestions.Get to you bank and get a pile of cash in your hands. As much as you can get in hand. While it might seem a ‚Äústretch‚Äù to think our betters will cut off access to our own funds ‚Äì or limit them ‚Äì think Cyprus ‚Äì re-consider that notion not on a few months ago. But on a few days ago.I have no plans to ‚Äòstart buying‚Äô back into the Wall Street Casino. And while my holdings are almost 90% in cash as I had no trust of these charlatans and their logic-free cargo cult ‚Äì I have halted our monthly contribution to our retirement funds ‚Äì effectively converting same to cash.Cancel every non essential membership/subscription. We will keep Netflix since we have an extended family using one account. All other shit ‚Äì goodbye. Every automatic withdrawal ‚Äì gym, Sirius, etc. ‚Äì cancel.

        Rest assured that the power that be are aware this is going on. They will relent for now but once the isolation is lifted, they will go pedal to the metal to force degeneracy back in and all will be well per their own goals.

        The rubber will meet the road when after the 15 day isolation, the government decides to announce an extension.  Americans might accept (or at least semi go along) with one extension if a substantial case can be made, but beyond that I think the National Guard will be showing up on the streets of your home town.

            I think we have to put our foot down then and there. The national guard doesn‚Äôt need to be here. What, are they going to hold the virus back while the snipers provide cover fire from the rooftops?
The evidence for a two-month shutdown of our economy just isn‚Äôt there. In no sane way is the potential curtailing of this virus worth the implosion of our economy.

        My wife, while eating potato chips, said, ‚ÄúYou know, a lot of women are going to get real fat if they have to self-isolate.

        Thinking through this some more, urban living in densely populated areas will join unmarried professional women on the list of toxic things once popular and now abhorred. The otherwise healthy young adults who have migrated into the city cores are about to get their eyes full, and it won‚Äôt be from the mortality rate from coronavirus. Corporate headquarters may desert the cities where they are clustered; it‚Äôs a miracle the financial sector has remained this long in NYC. The downside is the suburban and rural areas will find these types among them in larger numbers.

        This essay may represent a watershed in the analysis of the Saga of WuFlu and the Orange Man. If we could mitigate the economic fallout on the Person On The Street, the Great Confinement could be a good thing, or at least precipitate a chain of events with some benefits. A lot of people have been expecting something dire to happen for a long time (since at least the days of the Cold War), and now that ‚Äòsomething‚Äô has finally happened and, dare I say it, people seem relieved that ‚Äòit‚Äô has finally come.

        Yes, some bad things will follow from this global lock-down, mainly as a result of the economic impact. But good things too. For example, globohomo could take a real pantsing.In my opinion, globohomo was only feasible while there was lots of money sloshing around and the good times were rolling.  They may suddenly find that tolerance for their bullsh*t is inversely proportionate to the ready availability of ‚ÄúStuff‚Äù. To my mind, wokeness is a psychosis borne of easy prosperity. When times get hard and people are really struggling from day to day, their willingness to put with drag queen story hour may just evaporate overnight.

            Sure, why get too mad about that stuff when you can watch sportsball, chase poosy on Tinder, entice your palette at that fancy ethnic restaurant, or get drunk/high? Millenials lives summed up in 1 sentence.When the money and prosperity is there it‚Äôs really much easier to just look the other way.We could use a little bit more poverty. Join a sportsball league, chase your wife‚Äôs poosy while simultaneously popping out white babies, learn to cook your own meals, and (maybe?) get drunk once in a while. It‚Äôs time to start caring about real things, including blood and soil.Pleasures are good but they need to be in balance, life is both struggle and pleasure.

                There are quite a few of us that would take an economic hit to move the ball forward.  Don‚Äôt sell snarky antisemites short just yet.
I get a sense a lot of people are so hungry for something to change that they‚Äôre going to continue wishing.  As much as I hate to see things in binaries, the alternatives seem to be a status quo death spiral or social disruption (hopefully without a breakdown, of course).  It‚Äôs the choice of chemotherapy or hospice care.

        The great lock down indeed, here is Lagos Portugal it‚Äôs in full swing. I‚Äôve just arrived back from being stuck in the mentawai islands to be stuck in my house. We aren‚Äôt even allowed to go to the beaches, and forget surfing. I dunno if the compliance is an artifact from a previous dictatorship life, but they seem to love it.The wife was yelled at by a random car the other day here to ‚Äúgo home!‚Äù She took the kids and the dog for a walk. Was crazy, is crazy‚Ä¶Maybe I should I stayed in the mentawai islands, that is until the indigenous folks start to get interested in the white devil‚Äôs money supply.Go to be home‚Ä¶

            In some ways we were more free during the dictatorship than today. What is happening is fear and the fact that people dont need to go to work. So they are happy for what many feel is a extra vacation this year not understanding that if we keep this up we will obliterate the already fragile portuguese economy.

        The pandemic panic will not change young women‚Äôs views on marriage. Single women only know what gives them status and what they are indoctrinated to want. Unless there is an alpha male wanting to marry them, they will proceed as usual once things get back to normal or at least as normal as it will be. The culture will still be set on promoting the strong independent woman.
That said, if unemployment is high some women may marry a beta provider then dump him once the economy heats up

        Well it‚Äôs nice the party has resumed in your neck of the woods Z, Not so in mine.Thanks to the CDC and MSM people are still scared out of their wits.Well the store shelves are still empty in my part of Los Angles county( includes Forest Law in OC).  and several military bases as well.  From batteries, dog food, paper and canned good to meat. The shelves are either empty or near empty.Forget about cleaning supplies.On the bright side you can find scumbags on Ebay selling single rolls of towels for $7.00Mr. Clean floor clearner is selling for $35 a bottle.These fucking scumbags won‚Äôt dare sell in person because people like me will put them in a ditch,

            I have M95 masks.  For myself, they are for a special case of a sick or believed sick person.  They wear the mask and it helps them from spreading their disease.  For a healthy individual to prevent acquiring a disease I have several full face chemical/biological face/gas masks.  I would wear such when in direct contact with a diseased individual.  I have enough for the immediate family in case we are forced to care for ourselves.These masks are new, sealed, and relatively fresh as they come from our recent ME conflicts.  They were cheaper then than an M95 mask is today in the black market.  It pays to be prepared *before* the SHTF.  For obvious reasons, M95 and full face masks are not worn in public.  Not yet anyway.   üòâ

                I‚Äôve been thinking that gas masks might be the new style for lots of reasons. As America third worldizes not only will you need protection from the exotic jungle plague-of-the-week but also just the increasing stench of all the, um vibrancy running in the gutters. Why settle for a boring old doughboy mask like great-great granddad wore to the big party on the Somme, though? I want mine to look like HR Giger or Beksi≈Ñski designed it! Also helps keep the face recognition AIs confused. Let‚Äôs throw in a gadget that adds a nice metallic tone to your voice while we‚Äôre at it.

                    The only real benefit of the ME gas masks are they are designed for combat use.  You can shoulder a weapon and sight it‚Äîassumes right handed user.  The masks I‚Äôve see in use in hospital settings often seem to have dual filter on either side and would seem to block shouldering your weapon.

        Diversity Heretic:  ‚ÄúHere in France walking in the forest, or on the beach, or swimming alone in the ocean, will lead to a fine. And they‚Äôre using helicopters and drones to look for violators.‚Äù  As I try and remain ‚Äúreasonable and balanced‚Äù when weighing the current problem, it‚Äôs pretty noteworthy when a sophisticated country like France is so concerned about this virus that they‚Äôre putting surveillance choppers in the air.This afternoon I ran into a guy I sorta know who‚Äôs a respected surgeon in the LA area.  He used to be on contract with the Dodgers.  We casually touched on the current situation.  I said calmly, ‚ÄúI think the media is exaggerating it.‚Äù  He said calmly, ‚ÄúI think they‚Äôre  understating it.‚Äù  It took me aback.  I‚Äôve not heard anyone say that. Not now.Granted he‚Äôs an eccentric.  Our short exchange was weird like a movie scene.  The guy has almost zero affect (emotional expression).  There‚Äôs often a character in a movie like him.  Meant to be a seer.  Character shows up for a brief moment, and says something unnerving.  Recall that short, silent Marine early on in The Deer Hunter wedding bar.  The ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù guy.

        One of the things they are worried about is the fact that our health care system will be overwhelmed because of this, hence the total lockdown they would like to impose.  Apparently, the solution in China was to construct emergency hospitals.  Seems to me that would be a more logical solution for here as well rather than shutting down whole economies and potentially causing a depression.

            The emergency hospitals were nothing more than a Potemkin village.  A hospital is more than a concrete pad and cots.  Those don‚Äôt go up over night.  If beds are needed, they can requisition hotels and such‚Äîas has been done.  Medical personnel and equipment is another thing.

        I really need to try to get in a more optimistic frame of mind, but this thing has really got me spooked.  If I can play devil‚Äôs advocate for a minute, I‚Äôd argue that we don‚Äôt want women to start enjoying being home with their families IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION.  The more woman there are loving this whole lockdown thing because it gives them more time with their kids, the easier it is for those in charge to extend it for a month or three or twelve or eighteen.  I don‚Äôt know for sure if this is the case, but I‚Äôd also guess that more women tend to hold the kind of jobs they can do from home so this lockdown is giving them time with family at the same time they‚Äôre still holding down a career making the whole thing even more enjoyable.I don‚Äôt remember who made a point of this, but women are probably a whole lot more comfortable with totalitarian measures than men are.  I already saw some Canadian spokes-ette on the TV the other day making a point that all these measures are voluntary for now but that‚Äôs going to change if you don‚Äôt do what we tell you to do!  ‚ÄúAll those handsome young men in their military outfits out in the streets with AK-47‚Äôs are just doing their part to protect the children.‚Äù

        Springtime of impermanence. thanks again Zman for the Sunday blog. were going to get use to this. don‚Äôt forget to unplug too. and well written as usual.  as far as mask go my route is pretty big in so cal. for longer than I can remember I‚Äôve been wearing a mask and gloves in certain parts of town before this all started. when at Mr. Goldstein‚Äôs buildings I wear a mask. there are usually 25 grimey  strollers in the parking lot ,no HOA to keep an eye on basic maintenance and cleaning . and a odor that I cant get out of my nose for a few hours. now at MR. kims building you have to watch out for the spiting in all the common areas. why you would spit in your own elevator is beyond me. now as far as the Asian lady‚Äôs wearing mask and giant bee keeper hats, that‚Äôs a direct effect of plastic surgery preservation. (cant let the Michael Jackson nose get too much sun). I have to admit though, an Asian girl in a mask seems to have an arousing quality if its done right.

        Given the nature of this disease, I was never concerned about shortages. I also don‚Äôt expect the power to go out for any length of time. This is not like the human transmission bird flu in that John Ringo novel. I did stock up (and am still doing such) on all my  life extension supplements, like getting a 12-18 months supply. I bought a lot of contact lens solution (about 8 months supply) and some extra toilet paper. That‚Äôs about it. We have extra food around, but not a huge amount. I‚Äôm more concerned about the economic effects than I am about my personal well-being. This is not like the H5N1 in the John Ringo novel, nor does this scenario resemble that of the novel in any shape or form. This is why you can call me a coronavirus skeptic. Not that I think its fake (it is very real).  But rather I think we are over reacting to it.It pissed me off they closed the gyms in my area. I may join Snap fitness, which is an ‚Äúunmanned‚Äù gym that is still open. Otherwise i will have ot buy some sort of home setup to get through this. I‚Äôm not about to loose my physique or portfolio over this coronavirus shit. My portfolio was 2/3s cash anyways. Now I‚Äôm looking for buy opportunities.BTW, if your a fitness fanatic or bodybuilder (get bigger) like me. Consider buying AMPK Activator from lef.org (Life Extension Foundation). the ‚Äúexercise in a pill‚Äù much ballyhooed by the biotechnology people is a protein called Sistrin. However, it turns out that both sistrin and exercise activate AMPK, which is what AMPK activator does. Thus, the exercise in a pill already exists. You‚Äôll still need exercise, though.BTW, I recommend everyone buy the John Ringo novel ‚ÄúThe Last Centurion‚Äù because it is probably the most realistic description of what a REAL pandemic (60% death rate of total population) would be like.

        As a board certified anesthesiologist I wear several different types of masks. One a standard surgical mask to protect the patient from my sneeze or cough. The other is a well sealed p100 mask for cases such as an open lung with tuberculosis or a laser ablation of human papilloma virus. To protect me from the patient. If we had enough of these types of masks for the entire population that were going to be around other people, the R0 value of the virus would immediately drop below 1 and the economy would not be in shambles. This is science and reason. If you think that is wrong z boy please refute with science and reason.

                Some other things we don‚Äôt have (besides masks): surge capacity at hospitals, staff to man them. This thing could get very, very bad later this year per many scenarios.

                Are you saying that a p100 mask is magic. No one said P0 would reach zero. It would reach values less than one that is why Taiwan is where they are in cases because people still exposed to the air of other people are all wearing masks. And no I don‚Äôt want to punch them for being intelligent.

            The problem here is that there are no masks to be had at the moment.  Our local gov has reached out to the mold and asbestos abatement companies to give up their PPE for the medical community and first responders.   I don‚Äôt know if that will even make a dent in the need.

                Canadian media is lying and saying that masks are ineffective. The medical people are also terrified that they are going to run out of PPE, especially masks. Put 2 and 2 together on this one.
These people who outsourced all of our manufacturing base to alien countries should be seen as traitors, and summarily treated as such. Anybody in a position of authority who outsourced to China or an alien land. Yes, the large portion of these individuals will be ‚Äúright wing‚Äù white males, but it is what it is.

                    The filter media, at least the correct kind is not outsourced.
The actual media manufacturers (there are only a few) are in the USA and Europe. Assemblers of course are from all over.
The incorrect masks come from people being cheap. You need a mask made of Nanofiber media with an electro spinning process, not melt blown.
Melt blown is easier to produce in larger quantities so that‚Äôs what people do.

            Yes, and a tyrannical government could shoot any citizen not wearing a full enclosure Level D hazmat suit when out in public. That will get to the R0 to nil. Not all solutions are equal, feasible, or advisable. Once upon a time, recognizing reality was both common sense and ancient wisdom. Sadly, no more.

        Just watched Trumps‚Äôs press conferenceIn the time of such a crises to hear that totally incoherent drivel, jesus christ he is not even capable of formulating one clear logical sentence when completely clear a mind, an unprecedented courage and vision are so badly neededThese are people normies put trust in, these are people that normies are begging to bring curfew and armies on the streetsTrump has no clue what he is doing. In the time of the total disorder (that he created or helped create) he speaks for 5 minutes about alleged billions he lost to get the throneMultitudes incensed by irrational fear of dying are ready to give give anything and beg for slavery, corrupt mediocre politicians are ready to do anything to cling to powerPerfect a storm is gatheringThose who survive will tell the story
