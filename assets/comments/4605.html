        Why did we invade Iraq?  First, the coalition we had put together to contain it was falling apart.  France and the Turks were out.  The Saudis were in the process of physically kicking us out of their country.  The Brits and the Kuwaitis were getting wobbly.  There was a real panic going on in certain capitals that wasn’t making it into the media.Second, I don’t think that all of those capitals thought Team America would pull the trigger.  Once they realized that not only were we going in, but the Rumsfeld had configured the force for a strategic raid with regime change as the mission and no “Phase IV,” the panic increased.Third, heads of government and foreign ministers in those same capitals got on the phone with Colin, James, Ed and all of the other “reasonable” members of the Bush machine and gave them some variation of the “you broke it, you own it,” speech.Fourth, rather than quickly turning over the government of Iraq to some Sunni crooks and hightailing it out of there, we handed over the reigns to State and spent eight years fighting COIN.  (I will spare you my opinion as to whether or not we won.)  After all of blood and treasure spent, we turned over Iraq to a bunch of Shia crooks instead.I’m not a Rumsfeld fan, and was appalled by his team’s plan as anyone else.  There were plenty of opportunities to off ramp (that seems to be what the smart set calls it) from the eight-year guerrilla war.  E.g. we could have set up an Iraqi confederation with Kurd, Sunni, and Shia states as members.  There still would have been ethnic cleansing and low-level warfare.  Maybe even A-Q would have gotten control of the Sunni statelet.  But how is that any different than what we face right now?

        The war may well be coming, at least here in Europe. The muslim invasion is well-established, and their friends in the media (who will find themselves up against the wall with the rest of us no matter how much they bleat about tolerance and ‘love’ ) are working tirelessly to tell us what good thing it is to have lots of brown-skinned people who don’t want to be like us. Integration? Only if we integrate into what they want, on their terms.I fear, though I have to accept, that this war will divide our own people. There will be, the way the ‘useful idiots’ of socialism always do, those who support the muslim hordes and help them achieve what they want (as I say, until it becomes all too obvious even for lefties that the invaders’ demands are, well, just too damned demanding). I also fear that the US will, understandably, draw in its horns as it has been emasculated by the likes of the Obamas and probably the Clintons. Isolationism may protect the US for a while but not for ever, but then politics has always been about the short term over the long term.As we are on our own in Europe, sacrificed as halal meat, it will not be pretty. Still, while it is not what we voted for (the choice was never put to us) the people we voted for have their own agenda — and their own ‘get out if the going gets rough’ avenues.The other day at the dinner table a relative asked what I thought of all the migrants pouring across the Med. Al-Beeb keeps pumping out the propaganda of doe-eyed babies being rescued from sinking boats, saying how kind the Royal Navy is in helping. They even showed an inflatable boat beaching on the shore of Kos and the newly-arrived African men (no babies, and all male) running, helter-skelter, into the streets of the local town, pulling on woolly hats to disguise themselves while a compatriot stabbed the rubber boat with a knife and then fled too. No adverse comment, only merely informing us these people have reached safety and freedom.What did I think? I was honest. ‘It is over for us. We cannot keep taking them in, housing and feeding them all, cannot hope to sustain what we have already. We are lost.’The reactions as shocked. When I looked at a relative who teaches I asked him how many children did he teach. ‘Altogether, all classes… 400,’ he said.‘We haven’t got jobs for those. Not now. More people, all coming here uninvited to ‘work’ and improve our society supposedly… We can’t look after what we have. A lot of your 400 won’t get jobs, whether we take in more or we say stop today. But, it is too late. Free money from our failing system will be sent to relatives still in Africa and the Middle East, and they will come too. Free healthcare? Why not have more children. How many more kids do you want to have to teach? Your 400 will become 500, then 600, many with rudimentary grasp of English. Standards — which matter to teachers like you — will drop like a stone. Tribalism will explode, factions form. School hallways will be run by gangs.’The reaction was muted silence, but fortunately not at the BBC, who still keep telling us it will all be alright if we just accept.ISIS can blow their part of the world apart, but already they are slipping their agents into the packs and we await their input here in crowded European cities — all with increasingly limited hospital wards — with interest, and fear.

        The dissolution of the Iraqi Army was a contentious decision. Unfortunately, we all woke up one morning to discover Bremmer had pulled the trigger. Unlike post war Germany and Japan, the Iraqi Army was in part a jobs program. We would have been better served by disarming them and confining them to the barracks with pay. In my reading, I’ve come to the conclusion that the proximate cause of many post war problems was a blatant disregard for the principle of unity of command. We should have appointed a military governor who reported directly to the President through the Secretary of Defense. Instead we drifted into a conflict between a military that wanted no part of the post conflict and a State Dept that wanted all the perks of empire with none of the hard work of governing. Douglas Feith’s book has the best take. Like any memoir it’s partly self serving, but his recounting of the squabbling between State and Defense led me to question the maturity of anyone who served at the policy making level of the Bush administration.

        “How much of this problem we need to address and how to address it starts with understanding why this problem exists in the first place. That means owning up to our own mistakes and avoiding a repeat of them going forward. ”Honestly, I don’t think that’s even possible anymore.  The near-deification of The State has led to a sort of pretension to infallibility on the part of its minions.  To admit a mistake is to declare oneself unfit.  Why else did the press incessantly nag George Bush to confess to having made a mistake, or gotten something wrong?  They knew that merely admitting such a pedestrian fact would implicitly invalidate his right to “rule”.  (He wouldn’t have thought in such terms, but they do.)  I think Bush understood what they were up to, because he resisted giving them the satisfaction.  Obama never admits to being wrong about ANYTHING; when you pose as a god, you can’t be seen to bleed.

        Our biggest mistake in foreign policy is to assume the “others”  have the same value system as the West and if we could only get them to stop savaging long enough why they will have free elections and democratically march into the future with peace and love for all.  How’s that working out?.  As with any combatant, it is wise to asses at bottom who your adversary is.  The Art Of War is instructive in this matter. The West is continually trying to overlay Western ideals of democracy on tribal societies with little or no success. Taking western might and overpowering an adversary is not always the way to win.  We have misunderstood our “enemies”  for many years now and are reaping the fruits of the seeds sown before.  If it is to be war, then let it be full on, take no prisoners, salt the earth and win or stay home until such time that it becomes necessary to to engage.  But don’t worry, we now have Marie Harf advising John Kerry on Middle Eastern affairs so all is sure to end well.  As per Z’s  observation, they can surly see “over the hill” as to where their actions will lead.

        US foreign policy sins of omission and commission certainly contributed to the rise of ISIS, but we didn’t invent Islam, nor did we invent the desire of the adherents of Mohammed to bring the entire world under an Islamic caliphate. By helping to create a power vacuum in the Middle East in regards to Iraq, the Islamists seized the opportunity they’d been waiting for. Perfect timing for them. They have been busily depopulating the conquered areas of Christians and anyone else who is not on board 110% with their agenda. When their work is done there they will move on, like locusts. Eventually Syria will fall to them, and I wouldn’t be surprised if they started to move closer to Southern Europe for future incursions. What’s Europe gonna do, fight back from the fetal position?

            Doubtful ISIS will go against EU countries. Since it is basically a Sunni sect they will most likely go at Iran. Centuries of bitter Sunni Shia rivalry is been played out in Iraq and Syria now. Besides eu is an oil and gas customer and you need money to wage war and post those videos on YouTube.

                I might agree with that assessment re: Iran if Iran wasn’t so dead-set on obtaining nukes. They wouldn’t think twice about using them against ISIS. True about the oil and gas, but Europe is not their only customer. And Europe has plenty of Moslem enclaves to help out any invading “brothers”. After all, Europe was almost overrun in the 17th century by the Mohamadens. They were stopped at the gates of Vienna by Polish King Jan Sobieski and his men.

                    I know I live 3 hours away from Vienna . But Muslims of that time were on a comparatively even technological level with western Europe. Not so much today. Any terrorist attacks should be relatively easy to deal with for a competent police force.Also ISIS started as a Saudi project to get rid of Assad. Caliphate business is just marketing to recruit soldiers and Iran is Saudi biggest enemy. Lets say you are caliph and you are able to consolidate your rule in Sunni areas of Iraq and Syria. You are surrounded with countries with advanced weaponry (Saudi, Turkey, Jordan,Israel) supported by eu and us. Why would you go after them when you have the holiest Shia cities in south of Iraq only a few hundred miles away?Also no need to fear about European countries. One word from Angela Merkel and you will see afrika corps again in action

                        You’re talking like this is just one big geopolitical machination. Tell me how many Moslem countries there are today. How many Moslems are in the US compared to just 10 years ago? The vast majority will never assimilate for they are here as part of the Hijra. Same in Europe. ISIS is just the “warrior” group consolidating power in the ME for the larger picture. They are not the “JV” team Obama makes them out to be.

                    And I thought we were stupid for hitting a Nissan truck with a couple of guys with RPGs in the back with a million dollar missile.
Now, hitting that truck with a nuke… I reckon that says something. I’m not sure what, though, unless it’s that you’re really, really, serious.

            How so? I’m not going to pretend to be his confidant, but it is my understanding that he was a supporter of the Bush policies. if I’m wrong please explain. I would not want to misrepresent him or his views on purpose.

        Simon is a western Jew. It is almost without exception, impossible for such a man  to think that an ethnic group is beyond his power to persuade, educate, and reform,  The Hassid, who share the same mixed DNA, despise everybody. So perhaps what is learned can be unlearned, but there’s no sign of it.

        Mindful of “what is meant”…Is “Nazism”  a suitable word for the German rendition of “workers party” and so-called “socialism” in the same tent?Is it meant here to imply all the other stuff “behind the curtain”, JUST in German “leadership’s” particular historic camouflage with  “national socialism”?
