        The NYT can not help that it makes up facts to suit its emotional stance – that is how the left rolls. They rely on the knowledge that their audience is both receptive (to confirmation bias) and ignorant of the critical facts. The main street media fails to inform and seeks instead to shape opinion with revisionist history. They are not news organizations, they are propagandists.

        Back in the early days or the innertunnel, I would run across an article that was playing loose with the facts, do a little extra fact checking, then let loose in the comments. Now I just stay clear of MSM sites.

        Thank you Z for the Glenn Burke reference. As a lifelong Dodger fan, I remember the guy. He sucked….oh wait. Seriously, he was one of many “can’t miss” Dodger prospects in that era like Greg Brock and Mike Marshall and Franklin Stubbs who never really panned out.
