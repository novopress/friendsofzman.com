        “Free markets are an academic concept. They have never existed on earth.”A free market is simply a situation in which two traders come together and decide on a trade free from coercion by a third party.  Nearly every single transaction you make is along these lines.  Not only are free markets not academic, but they exist and have existed everywhere.  That third parties horn in on the action many times doesn’t change this fact.“Capitalism simply means private ownership of the means of production for the purpose of producing private profit.  Put another way, it is the appropriation of capital (property, money, labor, etc.) by some to the exclusion of others.”These two sentences contradict each other.  If people own capital and can use it as a means of production, then, by definition, they arenotappropriating capital.  ‘To appropriate’ means to take something for one’s personal usewithout the permission of the owner.  If you’re trying to use logic and your logic contradicts itself, then whatever conclusion you draw is nonsense.The reason that free markets and capitalism are used interchangeable by libertarians is because they are interchangeable in fact.  Libertarians clearly recognize property rights, meaning that people can own capital (which isn’t limited to property, money, and labor), and use it as they see fit, without having it appropriated by politicians.

            A market is not one buyer and one seller. That’s a transaction. Even then, there have always been outside influences on both parties. The only people who believe in friction-less markets are libertarian economists and sociopaths.
Louis Blanc, one of the guys who coined the term “capitalism”, said “what I call ‘capitalism’ that is to say the appropriation of capital by some to the exclusion of others.” So, take it up with the guy who invented the term.
As I said, I get why libertarians want to blur the definitions and sacralize “free markets and capitalism.”

            Until recently, in America the transaction is always free, i.e. you are not forced to buy anything,  consequently the free market, in a weak sense, establishes itself no matter what distortions the Government forces on the market.

He has been down in the weeds of running a business for many years. I don’t always agree with him but I always read him.

            Yeah, he’s definitely worth the price of admission on that count.Plus, he is tremendous at projecting the true persona of the apex alpha male, as well as that of a master marketer. It’s going to be a wild ride through November

        “It’s also a handy way of steering clear of the social justice warriors.”
AND the social conservatives.  Libertarians and technocrats consider them nothing but trouble, and regard their issues as dangerous tar babies that wreck their nice, antiseptic blueprints.  If anything that doesn’t have a dollar sign on it can be dismissed as irrelevant and unimportant, then it’s not necessary to bother with those emotional crackpots.
