        Sorry Derb, Ramaswarthy is not American and never will be – no part of the triumvirate can he be.

                In general, non-whites feel racial loyalty more deeply than other, more abstract, values.  Only whites have demonstrated dedication to values over raceon a mass scale.  How well has that served us?
Even if we expend the effort to identify the non-white outliers who hold our values above racial loyalty, there is still the problem of regression to the mean with their children.

        “What is it in the mind of this person that can’t just acknowledge that she has been in power for three and a half years and bears some responsibility as the sitting Vice President for the condition that the country is in?”
-Typical female behavior. Everything is always some man’s fault, not hers. She’s never responsible for anything. Ever.

        Bah humbug. Harris was made Border Czar deliberately. She and Mayorkas opened the gates (and built up the Darien Gap crossing to facilitate it.)
Harris Walz are Maoists, not Marxists. They both know full well how to exploit racial communism, since neither knows jack about economic communism.
Angela Davis is Kamala’s ‘auntie’, just as George Floyd is Walz’s stepson.Walz even took trips to China to learnand bugger his students out of sight,
The Democratic Party finds it almost impossible to find heterosexual managers?We’ve even got eunuch mandarins running the Imperial Capitol now.

        Since Derb is on about Kamala and anarcho-tyranny and all, may I slip this in milord’s:
https://vladtepesblog.com/2024/10/19/trevor-loudon-on-the-communist-version-of-the-skull-bones-kamala-harris-communist-networks/
Loudon outlines the network that gave us the gift of Kamala.
The important thing:  Joe Biden was a trojan horse.
Kamala was deliberately chosen, not the last minute bad choice of a party in disarray.
Her role is to greatly extend, if not complete, Chairman Obama’s Revolution.
Of course the Chairman has bosses, but the Red-Green ummah will rule as satraps over a conquered nation and captured military.

            This second may, or may not be considered related.(Well, of course it is, but that picture- the Replacement of the Aryans- is too large for this frame.)What none seem to understand, is the origin and purpose of Hamas: created specifically to incite and militarize the Palestinians and Shia as expendable cannon fodder- as an excuse to wipe the stain of the Heretic from those lands.The Palestinian Christians and Circassians, Lebanese Maronites, and Syrian Orthodox are the First Christians that Paul spoke to (as were the Armenians and Greeks wiped out by the Young Turks, as were the Yazidi and Assyrian Chaldeans by the Kurds)--these are the Stain that must be erased that the Mizrahi, led by Bibi, might rise and reclaim, to bring their God back to the world.Muslims? Muslim gypsies like the Palestinians?Easily replaced, there are plenty of Muslims.Arafat, the Egyptian faggot dictator, had fallen into the indolence of the six Arab families that owned the area under Ottoman rule. He was content to steal the UNWRA funds, molest West Bank boys, and build mansions in Gaza. (Had he slowed his armored limosine on the occasional ‘tour’ of the West Bank, they would’ve pulled him out and torn him to pieces. Jeeps with soldiers firing machine guns into the air cleared the angry crowds ahead.)The Christians and their holy places remained, as long as they remained useful.Fatah and the Authority had grown as useless as Republicans. Hamas was created to move things along.Are the American Scofield Evangelicals backing Bethlehem? No, they are not.Bethlehem, like Joseph’s Tomb, and even Jesus’s family crypt, are on the Palestinian side of the fence.(No, He’s not in it, all the rest are, mother, stepfather, brothers and half-sisters.)___________________________One last reason, and further: why an Israel, why a Ukraine?They are both of them key Gateways to southern leg and the northern leg of the New Silk Road, as they were to the Old.Mackinder foresaw that the railroads would connect not only the northern and southern oceans, a threat to the thalassocratic power of the coastal nations and Britain, but that they would also connect east and west. Thus the war of British rail against her competitors, such as Germany’s Baghdad to Berlin line, or the Portuguese east-west line from Angola.The regions wherein railroads and pipelines might conveniently cross are made chaotic, to stymie Britain’s land-based competition. Israel was a convenient and strategic dumping ground for both Britain and Germany to move their excess jewish population, who were actually quite content to stay where they were. Strong nudges were applied.(Britain, an island made of coal, had plenty of fuel for her home fires and steam; oil was not discovered off the coast of Persia until 1906, two years after the 1904 Heartland thesis, which sparked the Great Game of fuel for the navies converting to oil boilers.Iraq’s oil was found in 1921. Palestine was the Mandate, TH Lawrence brought Faud’s Wahhabists to power in Arabia for Ghadawar, and France split Syria Palestina in half in the original Nakba of 1922.)

        The US is much more  violent than the UK,John, no matter how much you squint at the statistics.So the Uk is less anarcho than large parts of the US as was evident in 2020 and every year since that fateful moment.
In terms of tyranny;  the US governing class couped Trump when he was in office and then prevented him from entering office in 2020.How many assassination attempts against the “greatest threat to democracy” have occurred this year?
Being lectured on Britain’s civic failings by a citizen of Switzerland I can tolerate but from an American?!

        Dagnab. Forgot to mention that as President of the Senate, Kamala certifies the election- as did Pence.
Trump is setting up his transition team entirely outside of Washington DC!No spies, saboteurs, infiltrators, or hostiles allowed!

        Doing nothing?  She’s been busy building out the anarcho-tyranny of Soros’ capture of the prosecutorial system, just as he captured the State Secretaries who control the state voting systems  before.
Thus the defunding of police, non-prosecution, release of criminals, etc. all in preparation to deputize the illegals.  Have to create the demand for action, you know, backed up by the DoD directive authorizing lethal military force to aid the FBI.

In power. Dumb thing to say. Look at me! I’m in power! Hehe oh boy.
