        If only the future would be about generational or class politics. Racial identity, which was suppressed by Boomers and denied by Millennials, is coming to the fore now. The disappearance of a distinct racial majority all but assures this will happen. It is ugly now and will get uglier. Hopefully the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see race‚Äù cliche can be put in amber and preserved as a warning for what comes next.

            Well, since only one race was ever saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see color,‚Äù and that race is becoming a minority, the odds are high that this anti-nature cliche will die.

                It took a lot of mind control, plus a lot of distance from diversity, to plant that anti-nature seed.

                    Sure, but the decline in Whites is what is meaningful to predict the future.  When the ‚Äúincompetents‚Äù become the majority, then competency is the enemy‚Äînot the goal.

                    What I‚Äôve noticed over and over is that Whites love diversity in inverse proportion to the degree to which they experience it. Where I grew up it was at least half black and the Whites (even the ‚Äúliberals‚Äù) were quite realistic about race. Now I‚Äôm stuck in the Whiteopia of the Northwest where we practically have no diversity but shoving it down everyone‚Äôs throats is priority number 1 for the local shitlib Whites. It‚Äôs so disgusting to watch and hear, like being forced to watch cuck porn all day.

            I know a member of the millennial generation intimately. As a Gen X myself, I find him easily upset and strangely emotional, like a chick. His brains are all intact but he wears his heart üíì on his sleeve. He is genuinely disturbed by the Palestinians whereas I don‚Äôt give a shit. The way to reach the millennials is to tell them a story. They love stories, and if it‚Äôs an emotional one you own them.

            serious questionwe all seem to grasp that enlightenment notions and ideas and intellectual formulations are falling apart due to their internal contradictions. So we are wise to discard them and to look for a new sense of reality that comports with our current age.so why are we then using Linnaeus style taxonomical classifications of that period, in this case race, as a jumping off point for how to define ourselves? Why for one use the classifications we use for animals on ourselves? We are animals of course, but we are more than that, and that cannot be denied or swept under the rug.therefore, taxonomical types of classification are inherently if not false then at least misapplied and insufficient and thus doomed to fall apart like everything else from that period. No?not to mention that for Uncle Adolf, rave meant ethnicity, and the likes of Fuentes would have been herded up and tossed from the nation. Yet he and many others seem blind to this fact?

                The problem with Enlightenment thinking is not taxonomy, it is universalism, egalitarianism and secularism.

                    taxonomy is a subset of universalismIt says that there are X number of colors in the crayloa box and anyone of that color is universally to be viewed and treated in the same way and can be expected to act and think and feel in ways similar. And the closer they are in color on the spectrum wheel the more similar they will beBut I will admit there is some reality to it.  But it has its obvious shortcomings and why it will never hold up over the long haul, like anything else that tries to simplify humanity.  Further a person is both who he is by himself alone at night with no one around, even more so than who he is when he is out being looked at by others and how they perceive him.  Race is always about the latter.  It is ALWAYS about being watched and observed.Ultimately why race is important is because we are living in what amounts to a prison colony under constant surveillance.  And the warden uses race to keep us at each other‚Äôs throats.  If you let race become your everything, you are a prisoner.  Hate to say but it‚Äôs true.  But I know you don‚Äôt because no one does.  Again, why it can never last.  It will always be facing the tension of how someone sees himself against how he is being perceived by someone else. Your dog may be this amazing fluffy and cute creature you love, but that is not how he sees himself.  And he will piss on your carpet to make the point, won‚Äôt he?

                        A. Taxonomy lends itself to particularism because it categorizes, i.e. it recognizes distinctions between group entities. It is not a subset of universalism. Closer to the truth, it is its antithesis because universalism denies essential difference and claims that categories are arbitrary.B. Race won‚Äôt hold up over the long haul? It‚Äôs held up over the course of tens of thousands of years. Genetics is not subject to your preferences.C. NAXALT is an invalid argument. Sure, there are members of Race X who deviate from the norms of Race X, and it may be understandable that they resent being viewed in light of those norms. But viewed at the macro level, i.e. in terms of a civilization, it is the norm not the deviation that is of the essence. The great mob is a force; the individual is a nullity.D. Being observed, or subject to ‚Äúthe gaze,‚Äù as Deleuze would say, is an indication that race is quite real. People are wary of people of other races because they are fundamentally different, and often in ways whose alienness makes us uncomfortable. And sometimes, those differences lead to lethal behavior.E. The warden isn‚Äôt using race to put us at one another‚Äôs throats. He‚Äôs using it to set non-whites against whites. Alas, whites who refuse to acknowledge the salience of race are the easiest prey for vengeful non-whites.

                            Yes it is, it is a form of universalism just at a smaller scaleYou are saying within Race X there are universal truths relative Race Y.  That is Jared Taylor‚Äôs entire argument.  Average IQ is just one of those truths.He cannot seem to deal with the complexity of life and has a need to simplify it.  Isn‚Äôt that his problem?  It sure isn‚Äôt mine.  Seeing the world as races of people to me is putting the cart before the horse.  People ARE whether he likes it or not, existence comes from within, not from without, and if he needs to experience his existence through the prism of some arbitrary set of rules then it just means he is rather unsophisticated and superficial.  If not a control freak as they say.  Perhaps stemming from his personal hangups because he was the only round-eye living out his formative years among Japanese where his difference was too stark to go unnoticed.  He doesn‚Äôt speak for me, and as far as he is concerned I am the same race as him.  So right there the idea of race crumbles into a meaning of nothingness.  He and I are NOT alike, no matter how much he claims we are because my crayon sits next to his in the genetic color box.  I think he just needs friends and wants to feel safe and protected.  He wants homies.  My guess.  But whatever.And this race thing carries a lot of baggage and cannot escape historical reality.  It is fine for you and me to say ‚ÄúHe is a black‚Äù person from a distance, but if we go tell him ‚Äúyou‚Äôre black‚Äù to his face he is going to take it as an insult.  Because everyone senses here is some guy who doesn‚Äôt respect me and is trying to pigeonhole me, and it always generates an angry response. People NEVER like being told by someone else who is physically different that they are what they say they are.  I hate being called a ‚Äúwhite boy‚Äù by a black person.  Because it‚Äôs like who the fuck are you to tell me who I am?  And you know you feel the same.  Race will NEVER exist in the abstract sense or in the vacuum we want it to.  So that also means it cannot be true if it doesn‚Äôt hold up to actual human interaction.  It‚Äôs how a sociologist or anthropologist sees the world, from afar, a zoologist, and no one likes being categorized and feeling like a lab rat.  Race discussion will never be free of that baggage.  It‚Äôs just a recipe for problems in the real world and precisely why the government uses it to piss people off and to beat us down.I know there are physical truths to race, but you can‚Äôt take that and then force it onto people.  Like you can‚Äôt say because you‚Äôre a lefty you are going to do this or  ginger so you must always be angry.  Or a Taurus and stubborn.  It‚Äôs just mean really.  It always reminds me of a guy who can‚Äôt control his girl so he uses a passive aggressive set of mind games to beat her down. There is no way around it given the historical realities.At the end of the day, as they say, it is all very much more basic.  Reality is far more basic and does not need to be turned into some pseudo-acamdeic scientific abstraction.  I do not want to be around black people not because of their ‚Äúrace‚Äù according to an 18th century scientist.  But because I don‚Äôt want my blood mixing with yours, and I don‚Äôt want the blood of my children mixing with the blood of your children.  People get that.  That‚Äôs reality.  Yo don‚Äôt need a name for it.  You just live it and go your own way and hang around people you wouldn‚Äôt mind your kids breeding with.Which brings up a further point.  Much of the ‚Äúrace realists‚Äù need to turn this into an abstraction for the simple fact that they do to have kids and do not see life in the true, real sense that comes with being parent.  It‚Äôs not about mixing blood. It‚Äôs always about some scientific mumbo jumbo, or an idea chasing what could have been.Make babies, and love your children, and put them around people you wouldn‚Äôt mind mixing blood with.  If that all sorts itself out among the so-called races, so be it, but it never will and will always become much more refined and based more on ethnicity.  A person can smell a person who is similar. Who makes a good fit.  We have five senses for a reason. Some say six.  You don‚Äôt need pictures, or isolation of the single sense of sight, from Jared Taylor to tell you what one grasps in his bones.Race in the modern sense is a belittlement and insult to the greatness and beautiful complexity that makes us alive.  It‚Äôs selling us short.  It‚Äôs bullshit.

                When you have been identified and targeted as a race, there is no other option than to use the concept as a weapon. Pretending race doesn‚Äôt exist is a luxury belief long past its expiry date, even if you don‚Äôt believe it exists as biology (which I do) but rather as a caste concept. The bottom line is that even if you cling onto the notion of race as purely a social construct, you have to engage in your own tribalism to survive, and tribe has beend defined for you.

                            hahaBut I will say as an aside that I think the Bond movies were multicultural agitprop, even though I liked them some years ago.  I can‚Äôt bear to watch them anymore, and not having to hear boomers putting down Roger Moore and The Spy Who Loved Me is always a bonus.  And the Englishmen I have encountered in my life were about as much like James Bond as is the black genius inventor in the movies and TV to the blacks I know IRL.I had a great time with a young lady who I was trying to set up with my son, we were sort of partners in crime, difficult relationship to explain, and were in London and it was her first time, and she was thinking the men would be like Bond lol.  We went pubbing.  Great city.  Pricey.  She never found her James.  She did find my son.  But Bond was the greatest bit of pro-english marketing ever.

                                    Depends doesn‚Äôt it?yes in jail it‚Äôs a necessity to survival if you‚Äôre just a regular guybut those same guys will leave jail and end up being friends with other races.  It‚Äôs a game that must be played.  The top dogs in jail get perks to keep their racial brethren in line. And the authorities get paid to keep the racial tensions on a low boil so it justifies increased employment.  In California that‚Äôs the reason the unions fight against racial segregation in the jails and prisons.  If there‚Äôs segregation they don‚Äôt need as many staff.sounds familiar doesn‚Äôt it?I would hazard a guess that 75% of racial tensions in America are due to purposeful governmental and elite actions , such as forced integration, lack of the right to self assembly as it were, and the media doing its part to stir the pot.  Yes it‚Äôs hard to know where natural racial disharmony begins and manufactured tensions end.  But a substantial portion of our societal dysfunction is intentional.  left to our own devices the races would naturally self segregate to a large extent. The problem is the ruling class and the so called oligarchs.  Blacks are not the bad guys.  They‚Äôre suffering too.  they have a hard time expressing it so they go violent.  They know something isn‚Äôt right.  They‚Äôre fellow Americans. And all this racial animosity would go bye bye if we stop seeing ourselves as races that must be at odds with each other and instead as fellow,Americans who supposedly were given a birthright to live among whom,we,want without governmental interference.  So maybe the correct approach is to try something new and join together for a common worthy goal.whites need to realize times have changed.  Thinking we are going to get back to being the stars of the show ain‚Äôt happening. That world is gone. We are just another racial group with self interests. And there is no shame in teaming up with blacks for a common pursuit.

            Race politics is a subset of feminism, which is why you are a feminist nation, not a black or mexican nation for example.  (Tho Kali-fornia could be a colony of La Raza.)
Generationalism is a small abstraction placed beside the reality of four decades of Leftist totalitarianism.  I accept my allies from all groups and can‚Äôt afford to be snooty.

                Let‚Äôs use a technique of our enemies and deconstruct.Racial equalitarianism was necessary to soften the ground for female equalitarianism. The reason was that until just recently, race was something abstract‚Äìmost whites saw coloreds only on television‚Äîbut all of us had women in our lives. So lies about race were easy to promote, and then people were brought around to believe the same about women even though they knew once at a gut level it was false. Our enemies are propaganda masters.That prefaced, women are conformists and followers. As racial tribalism increases, women will fall into line with their tribe more and more. That may sound optimistic but is has been the pattern for all of time. This fact of nature is the main reason I disagree with the implication that sex is a greater issue than race. Short term, yes, long term, no.

                    ‚ÄúAs racial tribalism increases, women will fall into line with their tribe more and more.‚ÄùPerhaps, but there are historic findings that might indicate otherwise. In Reich‚Äôs book detailing his genetic historical findings, he traces female lineage as well as male lineages in the racial history of any number of countries. One finding that has struck me is that in several instances of countries whose genetic demographics changed suddenly due to invasion, historical female lineage survived, while the historical native male lineage disappeared *suddenly*!In short, the native males were killed off by the invaders, while the native females ‚Äúspread their legs‚Äù and survived genetic extinction. This might be due simply to the whim/force of the invading tribe, but might also be in part due to the willingness of the female mindset to go with the ‚Äústrong horse‚Äù. I tend to see such behavior in today‚Äôs women as well. We crudely term it ‚Äúmonkey branching‚Äù.

                        True, and I should have qualified with remaining a strong horse as a requisite to them falling into line. The nations conquered by the Spanish in particular are a testament to the phenomenon.
eta: There also was a phenomenon of genocide against only males. The pre-contact Amerindians did this, and also the Spanish, particularly in their Asian and Oceanic conquests.

                    Radical Feminism arose after Affirmative Action, andparasitized off of it.  Both needed legislative sanction and enforcement.
Women were taught to tribe up, as a tribe seperate from their men, and gain the goodies and status.  They were turned from helpmeets to raiders.
That theirs quickly became the more powerful influence?Well, of course.  That they would ally with other raiders?That too‚Ä¶so, how do we get them back on our side?

                            Hispanics and Asians may not like blacks, but they prefer their own people as much as blacks do.  ‚ÄúLa raza‚Äù is something all mixed-race Hispanics (about 90% of them) are very conscious of.  Call them ‚Äòbeaner‚Äô or ‚Äòwetback‚Äô and they will show you that it‚Äôs racial identity/pride and not black fatigue.  Asians are convinced they are all infinitely superior to everyone else, including Whites; don‚Äôt confuse their disdain for blacks to any respect/liking for Whites.

I definitely noticed her use of the phrase ‚Äòtribe up,‚Äô and she addressed the main questions I had ‚Äì i.e. they are looking for a new home in a new state, and she plans to live a quiet life (i.e. go dark).  All wise decisions.  I‚Äôm glad I was able to send a small amount her way to help.

                I live in California. It is a weird place. [Born and raised in the LA area]. First, Mexicans and Central Americans are everywhere, they mostly don‚Äôt like each other, and occupy most of the police forces, construction, skilled trades, and such. Their attitudes are mostly Redneck, in that they drive big trucks, like to go out to the desert on the weekend to drive four wheelers or dirt bikes, are not woke nor green. They unsurprisingly do not want endless competition from their sixth removed cousins for their labor.But they occupy shockingly little of the elite power structure. For example, the Mayor of LA is not Latino but black: Karen Bass. The Gov, Newsom, is a White guy with long family connections to California power: the Newsom/Getty/Brown families, as in Jerry and Pat Brown both former Governors. The State‚Äôs Senators are a White guy (Adam Schiff), and invisible Alex Padilla. I forgot he even existed, I had to look him up.Structurally, the White middle class depends on a shocking degree on low cost immigrant labor for gardening, housecleaning, and often care of those disabled or elderly. I am the only White guy who does not hire immigrants but does the stuff myself.You‚Äôd think Hispanics would run California but they do not. They don‚Äôt even occupy the Managerial rungs which are mostly White and Black women of a significant BMI.

                    We‚Äôre going to see the largely fake racial category of ‚ÄúHispanic‚Äù fade as a useful descriptor.  Marco Rubio is Hispanic.  Sandy Cortez is Hispanic.  Put them in a checkout line at 6pm, and there are two more white people in line.  Sure, some of them are lunatics like AOC, but many are not.  Trump and his deportation policies are not unpopular with the sane ones.
Black stranglehold on city machine politics is probably at its apex.

                        Strongly disagree.  I would be shocked if any White‚Äôs first impression of AOC is just another ‚Äòwhite‚Äô person.  Her Indio heritage is immediately evident in her eyes and nose.Rubio is a genuine ‚Äòwhite Hispanic.‚Äô  I don‚Äôt know his precise genetic ancestry but would be surprised if he‚Äôs not 85-90% European.  And yes, % matters.  Eva Longorio is 70% White and resents the f**k out of White people.  Jessica Alba is 87% European, even though she pushes her ‚Äòlatina‚Äô identity.  Thick as two short planks, but primarily White nonetheless.

Perhaps a bit of a stretch, but Lynn found no functioning native with an average IQ below 93.  The typical Hispanic has a 90 IQ.  Blacks of course are even less, but have affirmative action and the wind behind them.
However, in my Hispanic majority burg, there is only one or so ‚Äútoken‚Äù Whites in the County or City government, the rest are Hispanic‚Äîand no they can‚Äôt run (well) the City and County either.

                    People in Latin America, and those with roots still there, do not harbor delusions about democracy. As an anecdote, decades ago in Asia I was talking with a barmaid from Canada. I assumed initially she was American, of course. She told me matter-of-factly she had just relocated to the Philippines from Latin America and found it refreshing that people in both places realized they lived in police stats. I‚Äôve always been somewhat based yet I bristled internally but didn‚Äôt voice it, yet in hindsight realize that was a sincere compliment.

            Actually, it was the Boomers who made politics all about identities, most especially race. Naturally, they took the side of the negroes and turned traitor against their own people. These were the counterculturalists who so fervently supported the so-called ‚Äúcivil rights movement.‚Äù Now it is true, of course, that there was also a conservative cohort of Boomers, but they were steamrolled by their New Left co-generationalists. Oddly enough, however, in the present it is the conservatives who are the poster scudders of the Boomer generation. When the Boomers were in the ascendant, it was all John Lennon and Jane Fonda. Now that they‚Äôre in decline, it‚Äôs Clint Eastwood barking at the neighbor kids for trespassing on his lawn.

I know, I know, John Lennon was born in the early ‚Äò40s or something, but give me a break!
I learned at the feet of boomers, especially early on. And yeah, the early X stuff was more radical, but it was also half-hearted by comparison. Millennials got it hard, but they‚Äôll be/are being disabused of it. Z are a different species so far imo. Totally online, with all that implies.
I think GG was exhausted, tired of fighting.

                Boomers had a part, but the basic timelines don‚Äôt jell.  The Civil Rights era did its damage‚Äîlaid the foundation for this racial equality and feminism nonsense‚Äîin the first half of the 60‚Äôs, both with law and protests.  The oldest Boomers were in their early 20‚Äôs, few in number and had zero political power.

                    Right, and, of course, Little Rock was the decade before that. Yankees thrilled at the idea of Southerns being prodded at bayonet point. At the same time the Civil Rights marches were going full swing, polos like Ted Kennedy were mandating forced bussing, but not in their neighborhoods.
I don‚Äôt think its generational, though. It‚Äôs more elites vs. everyone else, and they accomplish it by divide and conquer.

        I like to boomer bash almost as much as the next guy, but regardless of how true many such generalizations may be, and for all their faults, real or perceived, we are still going to miss them when they are gone. A lot, I think. The vocational competence, general law abidingness, and above all Whiteness, are not going to be replaced. Because they can‚Äôt be, by the demographics that follow. The GR has seen to that. These effects have already begun as they ease their way out of the workforce. It‚Äôs part of why things are so screwed up now. Relative to what is coming, the boomers were/are very orderly, hard working, and above all dependable. (no need to inundate me with all the exceptions, I‚Äôm already aware). As with all things generational, I‚Äôm speaking in broad generalities here.

            Yes, they were. It‚Äôs not all darkness. They will be missed. As a Gen X child, however, I have to say: most of them weren‚Äôt around growing up. At least for those in my town. They showed little interest in passing down generational knowledge and wisdom, choosing instead to kick us out at age 18 with nothing but ‚Äúgood luck‚Äù while other ethnic groups cottoned together and remained solvent.Now they curse us for our stupidity and lack of skills, but the fact is, it was up to the Boomers and Silents to educate future generations, they failed at it, and their solution was to spitefully import blacks and browns to punish us (and them), as if 3rd world Latinos and Africans would know any more than the children they themselves failed due to their individualism and career-obsession. The values of Gen X came from watching their parents behave horribly (generally), and that mark is indelible.If Silents and Boomers truly understood the nature of the country they were building ‚Äî and its complexity ‚Äî they would have done everything possible to prepare those after them to take over. Instead, they kept their hand on the wheel and never let go, and when their grip finally began to fail, they invited Indians and Guatemalans to steer the ship rather than their own people.I think the latter more or less outweighs their contributions and skills, which were used only for their own benefit, not ours. Now that they are moving on, they laugh and mock us and continue to selfishly keep their voices at maximum cultural volume.

                I‚Äôll extend the benefit of the doubt here, and take your anecdote as true, if not representative.
Still, the world you entered as an adult had Main Street. WalMart was not ubiquitous. Mom and Pop diners and storefronts were everywhere. Where were you as they closed their doors? The most charitably it can be put is that you were smart enough to understand that the younger generations would abandon Main Street for Amazon and never look back.

            The replacements definitely aren‚Äôt an upgrade but I would really struggle to describe most of those I‚Äôve encountered on either side of the counter or on the road in the last decade vocationally competent, law-abiding, orderly or dependable, though I‚Äôll grant they were white. I presume they had to have been those things at some point and suppose it could be some sort of rapid onset aging thing, but then I don‚Äôt recall seeing the same degree of falling-off from people entering their 60s when it was the earlier ones in the 2000s.

                    I honestly can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve found those preferable to their white collar cousins. It‚Äôs the same condescension, lack of concern for anyone else‚Äôs time, and expected (galling) degree of deference, just expressed as bluster instead of moralizing. At least with the office class I could chalk some of it up to the same divide that similarly separates me from some of my peers.

            Generally speaking, White and lawful are coterminous. Are the Boomers more lawful than any other generation of Whites? I dunno. But the problem of crime has less to do with the disappearance of the Boomers than with the innundation of wogs.

        The US is a bit like a trust fund kid. It could believe silly things because its trust fund was keeping reality at bay. That trust fund is running out. Vance understands this.

Even if the Dems could get back into power, reality won‚Äôt be denied now that the trust fund is near its end.

            Back in the old days, you invested with the expectation of a return at some point in the future. Nowadays everybody wants their money up front. What you pay is based on a stream of estimated cash flows. This has inflated the cost of doing business up and down the economy. I shudder to think what happens if the balloon ever pops.This also gets me thinking of all the business failures. Simple businesses like restaurants and supermarkets. Would these businesses have failed if they hadn‚Äôt gone through some kind of buyout and didn‚Äôt have debt piled on them?Down the street from me is a closed Bob Evans Restaurant, grass overgrown. They vacated the property last year and I‚Äôm assuming they stopped paying rent and stopped paying to have the lawn mowed. And look at all the malls that are being handed back to their lenders. That‚Äôs the way it goes in today‚Äôs economy.I just can‚Äôt understand why banks keep financing these deals. They wouldn‚Äôt loan you and me money with this kind of track record.

                Many restaurants fail because they start out with too much debt. And/or expensive leases. You see them, busy, packed, popular, and then one day it‚Äôs just over, because they started out too far in the hole and it was impossible to do well enough to climb out. For Bob Evans, it‚Äôs simpler. The food sucks.

Most recently they decided they aren‚Äôt going to bake bread in the stores anymore.  One guy I know who works for them got whacked when they cut 10% of their workforce, then they called him back because they decided they needed him.

                    That‚Äôs a good question, but if everybody up and down the chain takes their cut up front, and prices are inflated because of it, people have to spin their wheels a lot more to pay all the rentiers as that one economics professor from University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City calls everybody.

                            A good example of that is real estate. You take a piece of ground that might be $600,000, put a $900,000 McDonalds on it, and you resell it for $2.5 million. Or, you buy a business like Panera based on certain assumptions involving the income generated and cash flows over the years to arrive at a purchase price, indebt yourself and then the workers spin their wheels paying off that debt for you. (Theoretically, anyway. Most of these deals don‚Äôt seem to be doing very well.)

                                Ok. Real estate flipping is very hit or miss. Trump went from flying high to bankrupt to flying high over the course of about a decade. Too much volatility for me, even if I had the assets to gamble on it.

            Even if the Dems could get back into power, reality won‚Äôt be denied now that the trust fund is near its end.
The denial continues, though, but only reality matters. Look at the GOP. Congressional Republicans still think the good ol‚Äô days of Ronnie and W are just around the corner once they rid themselves of the vulgarian. The Left still thinks it will milk whites to pay for their pets although the oligarchs have decided they won‚Äôt. Race and bankruptcy will focus the mind from here until the republic liquidates in a fire sale.

                She is a voice for many millions, not a one-off.  And that is a big problem.

                    I‚Äôm not so sure about that. She‚Äôs pretty, and she has name recognition. She can shriek well. She also serves a very lefty district. She has her uses for the DNC.
But her ‚Äúpopularity‚Äù ends there. Her constituency would elect a potted plant with a ‚ÄúD‚Äù on it, even if the Republican challenger were St. Vincent de Paul. They will follow whichever person the local Democratic Socialists and DNC tell them to.

                        ALC is ‚Äúpretty‚Äù because the ‚Äúcompetition‚Äù is extremely ugly where she works.  The woman is at best a 5-6 and of course, not White.

                            AOC is considered ‚Äúpretty‚Äù because she was young when she arrived on the scene.  But her looks are already fading with age, as they do with most women.
She‚Äôll try to delay the inevitable with fashion and expensive beauty treatments ‚Äî ironic in a self-proclaimed socialist and champion of the underclass! ‚Äî but it‚Äôs over.

It‚Äôs a real thing in the world now, a propaganda object so dense that no truth can dent it. Because being the most literal useful idiot evermadeis the aspirational model for younger  Americans.

While it goes back much further, movies and television in the immediate aftermath of WWII reveal quite a bit of pos. It was more subtle and that made it more insidious. As was discussed here recently, GUNSMOKE was pumped full of anti-white hate, by way of example. The one thing that wasn‚Äôt over the top, and you can find even it, was the sexual deviancy stuff. Project White Genocide has been ongoing for at least a century.

To this day I remember how they‚Äôd look at us in incredulous horror and ask, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with you?!? What‚Äôs wrong with your parents?!?‚ÄùMost were driven into well earned early retirement in the early to mid-70s. It wasn‚Äôt all bad‚Ä¶some of them were hard. In grade five I WISHED I could go down to the principal‚Äôs office for a strap. Getting the shit beat out of you with a yard stick by an enraged harridan for flubbing a math problem is no picnic‚Ä¶and no way to raise kids. An experience like that makes you hate math and school which may explain why so many men didn‚Äôt finish high school from that demographic.

                To his credit, he was tired of the ridiculous crap popularized by two wackjobs in 1895 and 1925. These ‚Äúchild experts‚Äù advocated beating the kid for so much as twitching an eyebrow, and never praising them.
Plus, what Spock said that got the evangelicals all heated up was only in the first edition printed in 1950, but they still just can‚Äôt let it go.  It‚Äôs like an instinct in conservatives and liberals to always chase the wrong enemy.

            Yes. But to think in terms of national politics is too limited. You can build a legacy for your family. You can do plenty of civilizational cultivation at a smaller scale where it is more important and effective anyway. Musk and Thiel btw are Gen X and they wield real power. Individual Gen Xers wield plenty of power. The politicians are paid by the people with real power.What is important and one thing Gen X has an advantage in is rejecting this framing all together. Be a man building a house and doing his part to secure a future for your posterity. In that sense, Gen X have as much to contribute. It is always the organized minority anyway.

            Yes. Not just the presidency, but life in general. I am the very earliest of Xers and I have felt overshadowed by Boomer culture my entire life. I wasn‚Äôt alive when Kennedy was shot and I was four during Woodstock. I was in second grade when Vietnam ended. I was sick of hearing Steppenwolf and Janis Joplin on the radio by 1980 but fat, gray-haired Boomers ten years older than me are still listening to that shit at age 70.I vividly recall how the bottom dropped out of the economy in the 1980s, but the Boomers who were 10-15 years older had already scored some pretty sweet gigs.It seems that the job market went from being dominated by Boomers to being dominated by Millennials in the past 10 years and the Xers got skipped over. I laugh when I see people begging for tradesmen now that the Boomers have retired. In the ‚Äô80s there were unemployed carpenters, masons, diemakers and industrial mechanics everywhere. They were told to go ‚Äúlearn computers.‚Äù I did some framing in the early 1990s. $7 an hour, no benefits. Yeah, fuck that.Civil service jobs like police and corrections paid a fraction of what they do now but every time they offered a civil service exam there would be 2,000 applications for 40 positions and you weren‚Äôt getting one unless your dad or your uncle was connected somehow.I know a Boomer who retired from a GM engine plant. After he had plenty of seniority, the UAW agreed to let the company hire temps who got less than half of what he did with no pensions or seniority (That was one of the main issues of the strike a couple of years back).Gen X has been shit on and largely forgotten about for fifty years.

            I have marginal sympathy for the Xers.  They were the last huWhite generation, but didn‚Äôt know it and were hit with serious TV advertising blitz to get them addicted to all sorts of shit.
But they never had real self reflection about the problems affecting their generation or their country.  Instead, they went all in on predictable cynism/sarcasm and totally boomer-sanctioned thoughts on feminism, race, etc.

            I don‚Äôt know about that. I‚Äôm of the opinion that most of what got aborted would have been a drain on the kids and on this nation, if you know what I mean. And like our family trees aren‚Äôt enough of a mess already in this country?

                Whatever else is true of them, women who abort their babies have a whiter ‚Äútime preference‚Äù than those who don‚Äôt (plus other attached positive characteristics we can‚Äôt accurately calculate). Their babies would have inherited that. Instead they‚Äôre dead. That‚Äôs not eugenic‚Äîwithin a race, or overall.
We have fewer but more antisocial blacks, for example. And the mates who might have attenuated their children‚Äôs impulsivity/etc. don‚Äôt exist. Abortion artificially selects for criminality, narcissism, etc.

        As with all things, not all boomers are the same.  Growing up in the late 80‚Äôs and into the 90‚Äôs, one thing i noticed was how many of my peers came from broken homes.  Not many parents stayed together, lots of divorce.  But even amongst my generation, not all of us are the same either.  The funny part about what i would consider the majority of my generation, the types who say ok boomer, they complain about their parents, but their parents are still supporting them in some manner.  So they can pretend they are middle class.  I honestly haven‚Äôt seen the callous manner of boomers spending all of their money on themselves and living their kids out to dry.  In fact i‚Äôd say from what i‚Äôve seen its the opposite.  I do not respect many from my generation, its fun to swim against the current üòâ

            As to that last part in particular, I think the idea is more about the fact that boomers are less willing to share with everybody else. Like, you know, all the unwashed masses who are just salivating at the prospect of getting their hands on everything the boomers have. After all, it takes a village. Why won‚Äôt you share the wealth you scraped together with the Somali they dumped on your block you racist?Parents want to leave what they have to their kids and grandkids if they can unless they have some kind of warped view on life like Warren Buffett. Abandoning the old rules of prudent financial management makes it more difficult these days. Just think of how much money is flying out the window as you pay interest to banks or on your car payment. And then the stupid habits people have like gambling. That‚Äôs less money to leave to your kid.Then you have the problem of divorce and blended families. Two can live as cheaply as one, which means you can accumulate assets. People living apart because the wife left you after becoming menopausal, not so much. If you remarry who gets what you have? Probably the wife and the stepkids if you‚Äôre not careful.We live in very shytty times and the boomers do bear much responsibility for the current situation. And I say that as a tail End Boomer (who identifies more with Gen X).

                    Part of the problem is the wide brush we use to define Boomer *wealth*.  The Boomer cohort had 77M in it.  The typical Boomer is retiring today (estimates vary) with perhaps a *median* wealth of $200k or if a homeowner, $400k.  This is all estimated at the *high* end for the sake of argument.That‚Äôs not exceedingly rich, nor can one simply say that Boomers spent it all on themselves before retiring.  If you are living paycheck to paycheck, well yes, you did spend it all on yourself.What we are witnessing is that the Boomer wealth is a product of the divisive partition of wealth in this country that corresponds primarily to the post WWII economic conditions we experienced.  Basically the top 10% of the population controls 80% of the wealth.  Of course, that division has a high percentage of Boomers within, as it must have‚Äîno matter how much money you make, you‚Äôre gonna die eventually.However, we continue to label/consider *all* Boomers as wealthy when the overwhelming majority of them struggle like anyone else.  Or perhaps you think retiring with say $400k in wealth, probably no pension other than SSI, means ‚Äúyou got it made‚Äù!

                        It‚Äôs worse than that, though. There are the trust fund babies, to be sure, but most boomer assets are a product of doing things ‚Äúwhite‚Äù ‚Äî deferred gratification. The ones who haven‚Äôt a penny to their name seem to have never missed a vacation to Disney, or the first on the block with a big screen. Every couple years, they would toss a 3-4 year old sofa to the curb.The ones sitting on a mil or two are the ones who took their kids canoeing or camping in the local state park, not blow it on trips to Hawaii, even if they could get tickets for $500.Boomer hate on envy grounds is largely hatred of those who led a frugal lifestyle.

                        Yes, I was talking about the dozen boomers or so I‚Äôve known myself. Come to think of it, most of them are generous to a fault.
I don‚Äôt really know what the wealth distribution looks like in Denmark, but all the rich people I know are X‚Äôers. Whatever the case, there‚Äôs virtually zero boomer-hate in Denmark, except what‚Äôs been imported from the US. Boomers are mocked, but they‚Äôre not hated.

                            Its the worship part that makes it unbearable.  People lack self confidence, and look for the path of least resistance.  Felix was arguing with me yesterday about what i‚Äôm not sure but it made me think of these.  I went back to a site i commented a lot on back during the ‚Äúdark times‚Äù.

Why does it still exist? They‚Äôre a bunch of liars who were found out.‚ÄùI agree 100% with that sentiment, which is why i‚Äôm having so much trouble now buying into all of this. That same story about liars in Syria doesn‚Äôt just end with the OPCW. It was also pushed by the US government and the US media. My question to you Illargi (also thank you for being the most tolerant of contrarian viewpoints of all the sites i‚Äôve been reading the past ten years) why should i believe them now? How many times can i be lied to before my trust is fully broken? I‚Äôd say it was gone long before COVID. For 12 years i‚Äôve been reading you and others and waiting for the financial house of cards to collapse from its own corrupt weight. Suddenly it does, i mean the fed stopped raising rates after december of 2018, they then begin to lower rates spring of 2019, balance sheet reduction also ends that year, then in September you have repo issues that were still raging beginning this year. And pow, virus. I have been following this virus since January when zerohedge began to post about it. I still don‚Äôt know anyone with it, but thats ok because everyone already has it but doesn‚Äôt know it(asymptomatic carriers)? Not only that, but nobody and i mean nobody but ‚Äúthe fringe‚Äù of people is questioning it? You have no skepticism of this at all? Have you had any personal experiences with it yet? Oh and by the by did you see the skyscraper in the UAE that caught fire? It burned all night and from the pictures was quite the raging inferno, yet it did not fall into its own footprint. The lies and lies and lies, but now i should believe the authorities?

        Generational politics isn‚Äôt just stupid it is counter productive ‚Äì at least for our side. Sitting around and lashing out at a giant wall of them is nothing more than a sign of impotence and a lack of will to do creative problem solving.The Heritage American is under seige as are all ethnic Europeans. Our homelands are being invaded and we have been assigned and for the most part, accepted the role as the villain in our own story and it is expected that we are merely to hand over our inheritance. There are smart, capable and well resourced people across every generation who realize this. Rather than sitting around whining about an entire mass of people, which is what the AfroJudeo culture of critique is all about, the wise should be looking for the aligned and getting to work with them. I have personally witnessed a lot of treasonous dysfunction from The Greatest Gen to Zoomers and some impressive agency and civilizational energy across each of these as well.The future belongs to those who reject this generational framing. It was largely done to commoditize people. Sadly, the striver class, university educated Boomers also introduced this mess by revolting against their parents, their countries and their entire civilizations. It was carried forward to get people to categorize themselves and then trade their traditions and real identity for fading dopamine hits of simulacrum by purchase. It is expressed in coddled and uber fragile conformists buying Converse with the Anarchy symbol over the logo or the most regime conforming zhirls buying Doc Martins to become rebellious.The future belongs to those who reject all of that and get to work building relationships and fortresses as, to quote Evola, Men Amongst The Ruins.Eat The Rich at a gala where the rich are courted to make massive donations is the new Converse with an anarchy sign. Are we really going to be divided so people that stupid and flagrant beat us? Stop the cross generational finger wagging.

            ‚ÄúSadly, the striver class, university educated Boomers also introduced this mess by revolting against their parents, their countries and their entire civilizations.‚ÄùThis wasn‚Äôt their fault.  They were the first generation to be raised in constant propaganda from all sides.  The propaganda aimed at them was just that, aimed directly at them as a demographic.  In schools (at all levels), in books, on the radio and especially the tee vee.  This has largely continued right through to the generation in school now.  Anyone who doubts the effectiveness of this should look at the current generation of kids with the mass acceptance of all kinds of sexual degeneracy and the proliferation of trannies and homos and non-binaries in this demographic.  Social contagion.Anyone who thinks this is going to magically go away because time has passed is delusional.  If anything, boomers have been a stabilizing force in society, especially in the 15-20 years.

                    Maybe a stupid question, but what‚Äôs the propaganda weapon today that explains the uniformity of the school generation Tars described?  These kids don‚Äôt watch TV.  Where are they getting their Kool Aid?  TikTok?

                This is true. The circumstances around their childhood and ascent were designed to put them in a mental prison. This is still true. I know Boomers who held out for a long long time. Bush II‚Äôs criminal cabal drove them over the edge. He and Cheney and the neo-cons actions were so brazenly immoral that I witnessed many Boomers cave to the social pressure of remaining on that side.Then, their churches went. Like most, they side with power and the morality that power pushes. It is truly tragic to see people who remained somewhat spiritually healthy for 65+ years finally cave in and now just groveling and broken Wokesters and new age goofs.The psychological warfare aimed at them was very intense, very clever, very well implemented and was truly cradle to grave.If there is someone to blame, it is the specific people and organizations that aimed that propaganda at them and still does. When blaming, it is effective if the specific people are named and blamed and called to account.

                        One must have good information to make sound choices.  They were deprived of this good information. They were bombarded with propaganda.
One can make the case with covid that good information was out there, just not promoted by mainstream sources.  But this was 2020-2023 when sources of information were no longer just a few sanctioned sources.

                            Disagree. Strongly. No matter how hard they tried, the reality of both the demographics and disease statistics of Diamond Princess, what got the ball rolling here in the States, was available by mid-April. CDC‚Äôs own internal journal was available on it‚Äôs main page, and understandable by any half-ass high school graduate with access to a dictionary, i.e., the internet.
It was each person‚Äôs willful decision to take the easy route and listen to the hersterics that is to blame.

                                I hope you understand I was talking about 2 different groups of people.  The first paragraph was the boomers who existed in a milieu of ‚Äúprogressivism‚Äù and where an easily accessible source of proper information wasn‚Äôt easily available.
The second set is the covid stuff.  Getting good or at least better information in 2022/2023 was just a lot easier than it was for a 6 year old in 1951.
You just cannot compare these two groups, even if there is some overlap (people who were 6 in 51 were 77 in 2022).

                        Everybody on this thread is correct. I think this is why the generational blame game is in the end a waste of time.No doubt the boomers ran the biggest face plant in the history of human civilization. But they inherited it from their parents who inherited it from their parents ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶European nobles and true elites were having these conversations in the 18th and 19th century.The face plant is epic. At this point we just have to find whoever we have who is on side and join shoulders in a shield wall and get to safety.We have posterity in California who are only 19% of the population and in New York only 12% of the population. It will be our turn to be deservedly and roundly cursed if we don‚Äôt stop complaining and start building things they are going to need to survive.It is time to start looking and building toward the future for our posterity‚Äôs sake.

It‚Äôs not like the writing hasn‚Äôt been on the wall for the last 20 years, either. We‚Äôve been living on borrowed time since at least the ‚Äô70s. We either man up or go extinct.

        I dunno; generations evolve in strange ways. I still can‚Äôt get over my post-graduate European travels in the Reagan years. My Euro-peers were peaceniks who told us (Americans on tour) that they‚Äôd rather shoot their own Mayor than fight Russians. The nuclear disarmament and anti-NATO graffiti everywhere (from Spain to France; Italy to Germany) shocked me, a provincial rube. Amazingly, these same peaceniks are now bellicose EU/NATO ‚Äúmachine‚Äù managerial types, rabid to kill Russians. There‚Äôs an emergent quality to generational spirit. Consent gets manufactured. Zman could be right here, since he‚Äôs quite often right. But experience tells me it could go otherwise.

                Little or no talk radio. They didn‚Äôt have a Rush Limbaugh to change the landscape- and change it, he did.
There was nothing else national in content to listen to, for many years.Rush syndicated national content, I remember him talking about trying to sell the concept to the New York media types.
He applied a sports broadcasting template to politics, on an underused medium, AM radio, which carries across very long distances.

            As soon as the USSR ceased to exist and the international Communist tendency became a joke confined to Freedom Rock dudes at card tables selling CPUSA literature and old Marx/Engels pamphlets in the West Village in NYC, all of the NATO-hating peaceniks and fellow travelers became warmongering maniacs. Actually, strike ‚Äúbecame.‚Äù They always were. The critical error for 50 years was believing these people were harmless hippy-dippys, rather than commissars born too late. Now that they believe Russia is under the control of the Romanovs again, they have resumed their pre-1917 positions.

                The narrative of the 20th century as some sort of great conflict between capitalism/freedom and communism/oppression was always false. Capitalism and communism are two sides of the same coin. The Cold War was about which globalist, hegemonic, all-encompassing authoritarian operation would win. We see it now, as the American system was fully unmasked after the USSR collapsed. There was only one legitimate competitor to this ideology and it is the one that lost the war and it was made illegal to support or promote it.

                    Exactly so. Capitalism was simply the far more efficient system at delivering consumable goods to the population, flexible, opportunistic, and unconstrained ‚Äî most of the time ‚Äî by some peasant strongman who‚Äôd managed to kill half the population to gain power. And it won. Once it had, the mask came off.Now Western governments ‚Äî which had to spoil their domestic populations for 45 years in order to keep the ‚ÄúCommies coming over the Rio Grande‚Äù narrative alive ‚Äî have turned on them with a viciousness, without a competitor state of comparable strength to worry about. We only got rare glimpses of this during the Cold War, as in the South in the late 50s and early 60s, when New England Italians and Irish stuck bayonets in the backs of Southern whites to integrate their schools and push back on Soviet propaganda that the US mistreated blacks.Now they can do as they wish with us, and have, and will continue to. It‚Äôs bayonet-in-the-back-in-Little-Rock every day now.

                            The Spartan half of our culture no longer had the Klan available as a functional Grange, so they were drawn to the military tradition of male hierarchy.This is not to disparage the Klan. The were the most potent political arm of their time, with 20 million members from Michigan to Texas. The Southern Grange was thrown under the bus in one fell swoop in 1962, when angry white faces of the ‚ÄúSegregation tomorrow!‚Äù protests were highlighted in one of the first national broadcasts on early TV.Within 6 months, membership fell to 20,000 members, and the Usual Suspects who owned the studios switched over to promoting their Civil Rights movement instead.The Klan had lifted the union racketeers to control of America‚Äôs majority party, the Democrats. The WASPs were channeled into a more compliant venue, Evangelical television offered for free to church producers by the broadcasters.TV‚Äôs power as a proof of revolutionary concept had been demonstrated in a remarkable success, no wonder they and the advertising agencies they controlled offered it for free, ensuring its wide dissemination.(That‚Äôs also why South Africa took such sustained pressure to fall, only the mighty Reagan could bring it down when he signed the first sanctions. South Africans didn‚Äôt have television in the 60s, and it was barely catching on in the 80s.)

        Also note a lot of millennials entered the job market in the 2007-2010 timeframe and well it wrecked their entire career. And nobody ever really apologized for it or changed things. At least the calamities of the 1930s and 1940s led to some material prosperity for the average person. But young people in that horrible first term Obama economy were just told to look the recruiter in the eye and give them a firm handshake or whatever. That is what made millennials so resentful of boomers. and, you know, nothing has changed since. I have read several articles in the past year or two about how young people starting out now have to compete with boomers for houses on the market, who of course they cannot compete with because they dont have a lifetime of equity built up. The idea of people in their 60s and 70s buying new houses that aren‚Äôt in retirement communities designed for them baffles me, but it also trends with the materialist and hedonist mindset they have had their whole lives (which, to be fair, was installed in them by the social engineers).

            Older millenials were permanently scarred by that. The corresponding generation that came of age during GD 1.0 was by this point well into the WW2 boom/postwar boom that kind of made up for it. Nothing like that has happened for millenials. And almost certainly won‚Äôt. Except for the ones smart/lucky enough to get into crypto early.

Propaganda works. Do you really believe it‚Äôs always been sunshine and rainbows for everyone else?
The Great Recession was primarily hard on those who had bought into the funny munny scam of the stock market. Companies who were not operating clear out on the margins did fine. It was, in fact, better than the boom times. The more profligate companies had to sell off assets for pennies on the dollar.

                If you bought stock in, say, 2009, you did very well. Which of course a 25 year old millennial could not do because they had no money. And there was a fat bailout waiting for your company if your company was big enough and dumb enough.
At no point did I say that nobody suffered but young millennials. But young millennials did suffer and their anger towards the economic situation was funneled towards the Great Awokening when it got too much to handle for the elites.

Wait a minute.  AT&amp;T couldn‚Äôt make payroll in 08 because they were locked out of the credit markets in 08.  The NBA was going to go under in 08, insurance companies were going to go bust.

        Your assessment of Millennials is quite a reach if not interesting. After Boomers they get a lot of hate, much from Zoomers.
Funny how GenX people are getting the boomer hate because they are finding out it‚Äôs just blame on all old people. If you think the current old people are bad, wait till you get the next wave and so on.

                    My point wasn‚Äôt about Boomers per se. It was about the mentality of blaming an entire generational cohort for a mess. Is an army or battalion that sits around and blames everyone else for a mess they are in acting with agency or are they rendering themselves impotent by assigning blame?That isn‚Äôt to say there isn‚Äôt blame that is deserving. It is to say, that what is more important is getting out of the mess. Maybe, just may even if 8 of the 10 commanders are to blame there are 2 good ones who can help you get out of the mess. Focus on what you can do and do not blanket reject a crowd where there may be a good few who can join the cause.Yes. Many boomers are going to be in a mess in nursing homes being abused by POCs who hate them and who will capitalize on their vulnerability. So will many Gen Xers and later cohorts. Look at how outnumbered young Californians are now. It is time to stop the pants pissing whiney B.S. and band together. Should you reject the bugmen and cowards. Yes. But make sure it is an informed rejection that doesn‚Äôt throw out the baby with the bathwater.

        Interestingly, Trump had an Oval Office moment of truth with South Africa‚Äôs President (a man with a name filled only with vowels). He showed all the mass graves, the South African politicians, and even more tellingly the crowds of hundred of thousands blacks calling for killing all the Whites. Handed the President a stack of press reports printed out of White South Africans being killed. South Africa is passling laws forbidding Whites from leaving, and classifying them as traitors. So the plans are firming up.South Africa also was in the forefront of charging Israel with Genocide in the International Court of Justice, over Gaza, and getting not only Bibi but everyone in the IDF labeled as a War Criminal and subject to international arrest. They were flying high. But depend on US aid to function. Russia and China provide some money, but nothing like the US money. Important people in finance and other places want to Regime Change South Africa.Meanwhile Trump has a bargaining chip. He can mass import South African Whites and settle them into Blue States where due to their superior organizational skills and emotionally charged stories they will punch above their weight. As the Dems prepare for Reparations Summer, Trump can counter with mass White refugees fleeing black people genociding them. This plays into the Holocaust narrative, with once again the US as the good guy, black nazis ala the convient Kanye West. I suspect the ‚Äúdeal‚Äù offered will be NOT to have the roughly 4.7 million White South Africans put into say, New York State flipping it Red, in exchange for deporting all the illegals the Biden Regency let in. Not the least of which is the Military Industrial Complex well knows that Cloward Piven means the end of its existence as all tax money goes to illegals.Say what you will, Trump‚Äôs lack of ideology allows him even as a boomer to do things others cannot. Loved the daggers looks of Musk and Vance at Ramphosa.

        ‚ÄúVance versus AOC is a duel between competence and anxiety.‚ÄùI believe you overlook one important difference wrt Millennials‚Äîtertiary education.¬†Millennials are the most degreed cohort ever birthed.¬†That is to say, 40+% have post high school ‚Äúdegrees‚Äù of some sort.¬†This is a product of their Boomer parents, who themselves did not achieve such, but did provide the resources and encouragement to their offspring to achieve this ‚Äúgolden ticket‚Äù.¬†Of course, this makes a farce of a college degree since there really are many fewer Millennials who can make good use of such an advanced education.¬†The university system quickly adapted to the lack of such talent‚Äînot by holding standards firm and rejecting the unqualified, but by expanding their faux degree programs and loosening standards across the board.Is it any wonder that the Millennials have ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù about their future in society or that those Millennials who enter the job market are malcontents who expect more in salary compensation than their parents?¬†After all, they do hold the ‚Äúgolden ticket‚Äù.¬†They have every reason to be anxious, but they need to look within‚Äînot without‚Äîto find answers to their plight in modern America.AOC is a perfect example of what I (and you) speak of.¬†She was sent by her parents to university.¬†She double-majored in international relations and economics‚Äîwhatever that is.¬†She moved back to the Bronx, becoming an activist and worked as a waitress and bartender.¬†In short, she wasted her time and the parents‚Äô/nation‚Äôs resources by majoring in nothing of importance, practical use, or cognitive difficulty.The system did not fail her, she failed the system. The only fault of the system was its unwillingness to weed her‚Äîand her ilk‚Äîout of the system before her failure to thrive in it. Hence we are stuck with this malcontent in the House who serves primarily as a symbol for other malcontents to rally round. And so it goes in today‚Äôs society.Competence is, as always, in short supply. Today‚Äôs demographics does not bode well for that increasingly scarce commodity. If competence is to win out, there must be some fundamental changes in our society‚Äôs concept of the human condition‚Äîwhich is another topic for another day.

        ‚ÄúNo one has time for the hysterical and childish politics of the AOC side when there is work to be done, debts to be paid and institutions to be restructured‚Äù
Those are all noble goals.
What do they do, however, when nobility is dead and:Work = ‚Äúask ChatGPT to create a report‚Äù;Debt = ‚Äú$549 squid-gorillion Joe Bucks; and,Institutions = The DMV run by sassy blacks and pajeets so that aliens are given driver‚Äôs licenses and whites are given Covid jabs.

        ‚ÄúMillennial politics could be the domination of the organizational men, who take pride in making the machine operate and have no tolerance for throwing sand in the gears.‚ÄùThat is my greatest fear. Into whose organizational pattern will the machine be made to operate? I don‚Äôt want the goddamn evil Jewish pattern that America has been mutilated into repaired enough so that it can be put on life support, stumbling down the civilizational road several more decades so that my generation can have stable IRA‚Äôs and stock options and the rest of the paraphernalia of grift and parasitism.It needs to die so that we can get another country, of our own, with no Africans (carve out for the descendants of slaves a new country of their own), no Muslims (remigration back to the Dar al Islam where they belong), and no Jews (remigration back to Israel where they belong). I have a dream: government of European people, by European people, for European people.Fortunately I don‚Äôt think Pres. Trump‚Äôs repair will have effect other than to lessen the severity of the crash landing to come. There is no ‚ÄòAmerican‚Äô ruling class waiting in the wings to take over from the pack of beasts currently administering now.The people who have put money behind Pres. Trump are mostly a pack of merchants smart enough to know that collapse will negatively affect their bottom line. They do not constitute a collectively aware self-perpetuating group with the assumed right to rule, bound by ties of kinship, genetic or memetic. Most of them are foreign (notreal but rather paperwork American) merchants who would cut each others throats for a dollar if they didn‚Äôt fear the radical left more.There are certainly enough competent people inside America to make a go of it, but a functioning ruling class requires a delicate balance between internal competition and cooperation against the external. I think that attempts to produce this will simply accelerate ethnic balkanization, because ‚Äònormal‚Äô is the bulk of humanity having mostly quiet but occasionally quite noisy antipathy towards to the rest. Do any of these merchants have an understanding of how any civilization works, much less the ability to build a new one out of the ruins of corpse-America?Attempts to repair the system are failing, and thus serve to hasten its delegitimization. If we wish European people not to be someone else‚Äôs exploited human cattle, then remigration is the only answer.

        A study of history can bring both hope and despair. It‚Äôs maddening to read about all the unnecessary loss from WW1 and WW2. It took 800 years for the Spaniards to kick out the moors.These younger generations are providing much hope for the future, despite the fact that the older generations have selfishly plundered. Many young men are questioning narratives and seeking answers and they have access to so much information. My son had a few friends over the other night (early 20‚Äôs) and they were talking about dreams of one day being able to afford to buy a home and have a family. When I was growing up, it was generally understood that owning a home was in our grasp.That old Russian proverb: ‚Äúsociety grows when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in‚Äùis remarkable.

            You talk about history, but does your grasp of it only cover WW1 and 2?  I assure you, most people who worked in industrial america from the 1870‚Äôs up until the end of WW2 were not very different then your son.  Read about the families living in the cities about five familys to a tenement.  We‚Äôre going back to the future, while those at the top have everyone arguing about how many genders we have and who should be allowed to use what bathroom.  In a sense we are reverting to the mean.  The post WW2 era was the exception.

            Even in as controlled a market as exists now, price is based on both supply and demand. Demand grows every year. The high point in housing starts was the early ‚Äô70s, so supply has been shrinking since then.
There are a few of us tail-end boomers who could be putting on roofing, but construction is really a young man‚Äôs game. Housing was within our grasp because we had young men building houses.

        Generational politics is the elite‚Äôs way of making sure younger people never grow up and accept their parents weren‚Äôt perfect. That leads to wisdom and contentment and emotional freedom, and we can‚Äôt have that, so always making sure the inevitable wounds of a vulnerable little lamb introduced into a world of wolves never heal.emotional warfare and abuse.

It starts by selling the youth on some kind of utopia out there waiting for them when they get older, and when you fail in your pursuit of some fabricated land of make believe the media has sold you on, and you‚Äôre filled  with resentments, blame your parents of course.Like I say, and insofar as we are animals, if zookeepers did half the shit to their animals that elite society does to us, they‚Äôd be in jail.

            Generational politics is the elite‚Äôs way of making sure younger people never grow up and accept their parents weren‚Äôt perfect.It doesn‚Äôt help that the parents are hanging around for longer. My theory is that you don‚Äôt become a real adult before you‚Äôve seen both your parents in the ground, and it dawns on you that you‚Äôre now expected to act the part of Wise Elder.This used to happen when you were in your forties, in peak economic form and mental acuity, but now when parents live into their nineties, you‚Äôre sixty or more when you get handed the baton and by then it‚Äôs too late to grow up and make a patriarch of yourself, because you‚Äôre busy thinking of your pension.

        here is another relevant post ‚Äìhttps://www.oftwominds.com/blogmay25/math-doesnt-work5-25.htmlBoomers, Let‚Äôs Face It: The Math Doesn‚Äôt Work‚ÄúI am a Boomer, drawing my Social Security benefit, which like my lifetime income, is close to the national median SSA benefit. I‚Äôm solidly in the middle of the pack. Being over the age of 65, I also have Medicare benefits. Like many others of my generation, I‚Äôve lived frugally, saved money, worked hard, etc. Since I‚Äôm still working, I pay Social Security and Medicare taxes‚Äì15.3% of all earned income as I am self-employed.‚Äù‚ÄúCapital (assets, income from capital gains, speculation and investments) only pays a thin slice of Medicare via the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) on capital gains incomes above $200,000 for single taxpayers and above $250,000 for couples filing jointly.What we‚Äôre actually discussing isn‚Äôt just generational; it‚Äôs 1) the open-ended nature of the SSA, Medicare and Medicaid programs, 2) the impossibility of relying on two workers to pay all the benefits for each retiree as the number of retirees and beneficiaries exceeds 69 million people while the full-time workforce is 135 million, and 3) the extraordinary wealth divide in the U.S. where the majority of the wealth is held by the top few percent and the retiree generation (Boomers) for the reasons stated above.The solutions are as obvious as plugging a hole in the ship‚Äôs hull.1) The tax burden has to be shifted from labor to capital via financial transaction taxes and ending the multi-trillion dollar exclusions on capital gains.2) Social Security and Medicare benefits must be means tested; those collecting $10,000 a month in other pensions and investment income don‚Äôt need Social Security benefits, which should be reserved for those with no other substantive source of steady income in their retirement years.3) The open-ended entitlement programs must be limited in some fashion, and there is no way to do this that will not upset everyone. Hard choices‚Äìtriage‚Äìmust be made, as doing nothing is choosing to let the ship sink.‚Äù

        FWIW, for reasons I will leave out, I am in a social context with a lot of millenial Jewish dudes. They are very interesting. First, they know and are unhappy that the jobs their parents had: lawyers, doctors, bureaucrats, will not and are not available to them because of being both Jewish and White. Second, their response is to create their own business as a means of ‚Äúfreedom.‚Äù Freedom from what amounts to cubicle serfdom, freedom from Woke imposed limits on their ability to move up the social hierarchy, freedom from having to care about the Woke mob.I think people miss the generational divide among Jews. The Bernie to Gen X‚Äôer generation got in while it was good, as far as political grifting, managerialism, and licensed high status professionals: doctors, lawyers, CPAs etc. That route is closed off and the cohort I am dealing with: Millenials and Zoomers, are very bitter that it is, but try to be positive and focused on growing or starting a business that purposely stays small to avoid the reach of the Managerial State (they have told me this repeatedly).I like them. I have found them to both funny, kind, and ‚Äúmostly‚Äù our kind of guys. They are plenty smart. They know there is a Johnny Rotten No Future for them in the current set up. Their move is work around it. When that becomes impossible their move will be to overthrow it I think.

            I too have had many associations with Chews. I could care less that one cohort is cannibalizing the other. In fact, best to cheer it on, like the left eating the left.
My experience with them, plentiful. My take, whiny, efffeminate. Weak. Passive agrressive. The men all seem to have 2 kids, and one is ‚Äòspecial‚Äô needs. It is remarkable.
Lots of irritable bowel, depression. You keep them, sir.

        As much as we all deride generational politics, there is something there. My old man is a late Silent, but all of his cousins are Boomers. Even though there is not an extreme age difference, there is a WIDE gulf between their perceptions of the world. My own children are GenZ, but all their cousins are Millennials, and there is, yet again, a wide gulf between them. I have often felt, without evidence, that there is some sort of a loose generation connection: Lost to Silent to X to Z and ‚Äúgreatest‚Äù to Boomer to Millennial.

                I can pretty muchpinpoint where it all went wrong: it was those handheld LCD-games. I was a boy scout back then, and we used to run around setting fire to stuff, starting rock slides, building dams that‚Äôd flood roads and make camp fires that‚Äôd cover an entire county in fat, yellow smoke.
But that changed in a matter of months when those early handheld game came, we‚Äôd just lie in our tents all day, punching the retard machines.

                    TV preceded the handheld games.  We didn‚Äôt learn our lesson then and even proceeded to extend portability of the toxic devices to all.  Cell phone ‚Äúgames‚Äù I‚Äôd say rank second or third down the list of toxic use of the technology.  Media like Tik-Tok and just plain ridiculous social exchanges like text messaging would seem higher on the main use list.Be that as it may, there are solutions if one is wise/steongenough.  Our grandchildren for example are not allowed the use of any of these devices.  Age of consent being placed by family at 14.  Not sure even this is reasonable, but it gets you to HS age anyway.There are now old, non-smart, flip phones making a comeback.  Another big push is radio‚Äîas in walkie-talkies.  Then there is the old social gathering prohibition against cell phone use at the dinner table and such.We really need to treat these things like we did a couple of generations ago with smoking cigarettes.   üòâ

                        Yes, the electric Jew was pure neurotoxin, in many ways worse than games and social media: at least you interact with games but with TV, you just sit there, slack-jawed and flat-lined, the message slipping right past your conscious self and entering the subconscious unfiltered.
But gaming is way more addictive than the telly. And the problem with restricting gaming for the kids is, that when all their friends are online, you‚Äôre cutting your kids off from socializing with them. You can‚Äôt tell them to go play with their friends because all their friends are sat before the screen.

                            Setting a 21 drinking age just turned campuses into free-wheeling bacchanalia. Kids never learned to drink responsibly, and it shows.
We decided to take the opposite route ‚Äî gaming with family. Tabletop and computer. Now that they are on their own, they have no problems keeping their gaming in perspective. They had a good formative experience with it.

        It‚Äôs a noteworthy topic for a variety of reasons. I was pointed to the fact that Generation X  (a small cohort) is paying for the Boomers (a big cohort) and a such it strains the safety nets of medicare and SS. Medical advances are such that they are living longer too, increasing the misery. One that doesn‚Äôt involve the U.S. is the one child policy in China. We are now starting to see the fruits of that terrible decision (the sparrow thing was the worst, this it top 5).

        At least we Boomers had the example of our GG parents, a relatively patriotic and virtuous group. Those qualities have waned significantly and the coming generations are the worse for it. Perhaps we will be like the Emperor Tiberius, who some thought chose Caligula as his successor so that he himself would be missed by the Roman people.

        Don‚Äôt forget, boomers are partly the grandparents of millennials.  Their older siblings many of their parents are GenX, America‚Äôs latch key generation of cynical, sarcastic, anti authoritarians.Helicopter parenting was an overcorrection for the nearly complete lack of adult supervision of the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs in which GenX was raised.  I don‚Äôt mean that parents weren‚Äôt involved.  It‚Äôs that parents weren‚Äôt obsessed with controlling all outcomes, and were so focused on material wealth that they left dinner in the fridge for GenX.  Professional clubs replaced parent-run baseball leagues of the 70‚Äôs, for example.  For all their self aggrandizement that they‚Äôre the Woodstock generation, Boomers are OBSESSED with control.  It‚Äôs their defining trait.The millennial shift to Trump reflects the influence of their GenX ‚ÄúJoe Rogan‚Äù siblings and  parents.  My observation is that millennials REALLY struggle with their boomer grandparents (and the ‚Äúsilents‚Äù who preceded the boomers) who are much more preachy and ideological.Trump is not an ideologue, which is why he‚Äôs so broadly acceptable.  GenX cynicism about all things ‚Äúofficial‚Äù softened up millennials to Trump‚Äôs attacks on the deep state, his America first policies (which at their core are anti authoritarian, even if he would not say it like that) resonate with young people who realize GenX is right:  IT IS ALL FAKE.  All the ideologues have been repeatedly, horrifyingly, wrong and largely run massive grifts nowadays.  That‚Äôs what AOC and Ted Cruz have in common.Vance needs to help Gen Z ‚Äì our first fully formed and completely politically indoctrinated generation ‚Äì get deprogrammed.  That means Trump succeeds, but also that all the Doomer predictions fail to verify.  Some of the biggest disciples you‚Äôll ever meet are the people who realize, often very suddenly, that everything, every single solitary thing, they‚Äôve ever been told is a complete lie.Whether it‚Äôs the forever wars, masks, vaccines, multiculturalism, egg prices, Russia hoaxes, etc‚Ä¶all that stuff is 100% fake.  It‚Äôs all a lie.The non ideological politician post Trump who exploits this effectively, changes the country.Right now, that person, that DISCIPLE, looks and sounds like Marco Rubio.  He sounds like a slave suddenly free from shackles.The millennials are ready.  But Gen Z is the brass ring.

        To be precise, Trump‚Äôs birthday is 6/14/46, Flag Day, not the 17th.
Your error might be taken by Q aficionados as a message that you‚Äôre on their team, because they are obsessed with the number 17 since Q is the 17th letter of the alphabet.

            Upvoted. The truth hurts some, I guess:‚ÄúBoomers possess a mindset of relentless individualism and self-indulgence. The only God-given right and duty of each person is to find and express their ‚Äòauthentic selves‚Äô, and to buy as many things and vacations and accumulate as much privilege as they possibly can, without acknowledging the costs of these things on the wider society, or the loss for younger generations (which, as we‚Äôll see, are enormous). If capitalist discipline helps the Boomer, the Boomer will be for it. If massively expensive medical programs and unsustainable retirement offerings will help the Boomer, the Boomer will be forthat(but generally leery of giving these things to the poor). This is a kind of selfishness which is now unremarkable in the United States, but it originated with this generation and now it‚Äôs almost universal.‚ÄùThis is the mantra of 90% of Western whites in public, and it goes to 99% in private. But that ethos passed to Gen X, and then to Millennials, so I don‚Äôt want to single out the Boomers as unique in this regard. Were Gen X and Millennials to be turned into Boomers overnight ‚Äî with all of their benefits and wealth ‚Äî they would act in exactly the same way as Boomers.The problem is unsolvable. A generous, virtue person facing a mob of individualists in any setting (the home, the office, a discussion among men playing cards) comes across as a fool for saying things that 100 years were common sense. You cannot survive alone, even with money, but the truth is, most people both believe and want this to be true.

                Agreed. This day of the pillow nonsense was started by that faggot, Vox Day and now all his cellar dwelling fan bois and incels are using it.
The oldest Boomers are now in their 80s. Grow up ‚Äì people start getting old and stupid at that age. It happens to everyone ‚Äì except guys like Peter Pan and Vox Day who‚Äôve made the conscious choice to never grow up.
A lot of Boomer stupidity is driven by losing their marbles with advanced age. I suppose I shouldn‚Äôt be a dink myself‚Ä¶caring for the elderly is extremely challenging sometimes.

        While the essay captures the mood of generational friction, it trades analytical depth for polemic, and that undermines its more interesting insights.It offers a sweeping and often cynical view of generational politics, but it suffers from several critical flaws. First, it relies heavily on generalizations that, while rhetorically effective, lack nuance. Reducing baby boomers to ‚Äúgreedy geezers‚Äù and millennials to anxious conformists ignores the diversity of experience and ideology within both groups. These broad strokes obscure more than they reveal.The essay also treats historical and cultural shifts as though they are solely driven by generational identity, ignoring the powerful roles played by economics, technology, race, and class. Its portrayal of Trump as a stand-in for boomer politics and J.D. Vance as the millennial heir apparent is both simplistic and selectively constructed. Trump‚Äôs political appeal cuts across generations, and Vance‚Äôs trajectory is far from representative of millennial experience at large.Moreover, the framing of millennial politics as a binary between ‚Äúcompetence‚Äù and ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù not only unfairly delegitimizes progressive concerns, but also assumes that conservative managerialism is inherently more rational or effective‚Äîan assertion that deserves more scrutiny than it receives here.
