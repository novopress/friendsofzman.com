        I try to point people to the example of former Representative Steve King from Iowa. That guy was very mildly pro-White and his own party pulled out all the stops to destroy him and replace him with some empty suit normie. The GOP itself has declared that there is no place for being pro-White.

                They’ve already destroyed him. There’s no way they will let him win this fall — unless they plan to make him the fall guy holding the bag when it all goes sideways.

                    Name someone better. If nothing else, his big mouth took the gag off our mouths to discuss the issues important to us. He moved the Overton Window pretty far to the right on immigration, war and a whole host of other issues. Name another president other than Reagan who was able to do that.

                        They can’t and they won’t.They won’t even answer “If you could wish upon a star,” who would you have as president? Nope. Someone will be president whether they like it or not. So they’ll put their heads up their asses and pretend that the presidency has zero affect on them. Like a child covers his ears when mommy yells at them. If I don’t see it or hear it it isn’t real!None if this invalidates Z’s point about the lesser of two evils vote. None the less, as it stands, There will be a president and one will be worse than others. They will live under that president and it will impact their lives like it or not.Who here would like to publicly state that life wasn’t better under Trump than Biden?Go down the Covid road, under Biden it would have been an absolute nightmare by comparison.

                            Nonsense. The power structure is far more important than the prez, and the power structure rode and will ride roughshod over Trump even assuming he attempts to govern more sanely than Biden.

                            It is true that we know the emperor Majorian (457-461) mainly through all the nice things Gibbon said about him. But let’s just go along with Gibbon here and agree that Majorian was one of the “last Romans”, doing his best to reverse the decay of the Empire. It didn’t matter, because when the real power at Court  – Count Ricimer – decided that enough was enough, he had Majorian killed. The last “western” emperors after Majorian were playthings of the “deep state”, until Odoacer decided the pretense was no longer necessary, and declared “loyalty” to the “Roman” Empire then seated in Constantinople.I regard Trump as our Majorian – the last “American” president. Overwhelmed by conditions and by rivalries within the Court, all oaring in the opposite direction, he can’t accomplish anything, even if elected.The GAE might well survive, just as “Rome” did for a thousand years in another city, speaking another language.

The GOP is the party that burned Atlanta to the ground, issued the Brown v. Board decision, and sent the 101st Airborne to Little Rock High with bayonets fixed to make sure that white girls had the “constitutional right” to mudshark with the colored bucks sitting next to them in class.

        Z manIn relation to the Israel issue you left out one important piece of the puzzle making this whole thing in Washington function.Christian Zionists.I deal with them in my life as a christian, some of them are loved ones and close relatives and there are millions of them across the United States.They are totally blinded by the idea that” Gods people” the jews, cant possibly be wrong, after all everything that happens that is related to Israel and the jews just means Jesus is coming back sooner.Its a huge problem in the United States and a problem that enables a lot of bad stuff in our national government.The christian Zionists will thank the Rabbi for banning the new testament. They are that far gone.

            The same.
They’ve forgotten the eschatology of their movement which originally promoted Zionism:  it would lead eventually and inevitably lead to Armeggedon (that’s bad) and the return of Christ (that’s good).
It’s a twisted variant of the Ulta-Orthodox Jewish “if we’re clever, we can trick God and beat him at his own game.”
It also didn’t exist in Christianity until the 1900’s.
Ultimately you can’t blame outsiders for subverting your faith.  Jews don’t allow this, neither do Muslims.  I don’t know how this gets fixed, but voting ain’t it.
It’s a spiritual crisis.

                In a span of less than a century, white people went from being the toughest people on the planet to the weakest, softest, most pathetic. And the failure to safeguard Christianity against subversion is a clear symptom of the weakness.

                    Indeed.  I’ve thought of this a lot lately.  All I can conclude is that we are genetically ill equipped for abundance and prosperity.  To the White person this is the equivalent of fentanylto an addict. We as a people need to struggle, without which we become insane and die.

                        Nietzsche and perhaps others make a pretty good case that it was Christianity that brought down the Roman Empire and perhaps did the same to Western Europe centuries later. Hint “being tough” is highly relevant while religion not necessarily.

                You can bet that Christians are going to try and blame someone else though, it’s a lot easier to blame ol Scratch than look at reform.
The religion seems to have lost its ability to correct course somewhere in the 20th century, whether in regards to Zionism or homosexual pedophiles in the clergy.

                    Like every other institution in the West, mainline Christianity began to be colonized by the Left in the second half of the 60s, and by sometime in the 80s, the conquest was complete.

                                    Yep, now explain how this a**hole got into the position of Pope! John Paul was said to have nominated most all the Cardinals and it was always said he was appointing the most stalwart conservatives imaginable given his background under communism. Benedict was said to be carrying JP’s water wrt conservatism in the church, but he was not around too long to appoint/elevate many Cardinals—conservative or leftist. Benedict tosses in the towel (why?), then Francis comes about and disrupts/steers the entire church left (how?)Not that I’m a caring Catholic any longer, but something doesn’t smell right. Bring back the tradition of “only Italians need apply for Pope”.

            Most Christian Zionists are staunchly pro-life, so somebody needs to ask them just how they can support Jews when Jews are out there esaying that abortion is a fundamental value to their religion. They’re not even hiding it – they’re advancing court cases on this doctrine and aligning with the “Satanic Temple” on this very thing. They won a case in Indiana saying abortion is fundamental to their religion.
How can there be “Judeo-Christian values” when Jews value killing babies in the womb and Christians hold life to be sacred? This needs to be talked about.

The modern state of Israel gains direct and active ME interventions (US/Euro/Aus) that line up with Israeli interests…but has this really been a blessing for America? and has this really been a curse for the more disinterested Russia?

                It would funny if it weren’t so tragic. The Leftist nuts support a group that would kill their beloved “queers” without a thought; the crazy Christian zionists support a country that is a leader in promoting “gayness”. The whole world is crazy right now.

            They’ve been taught, “the worse it gets, the better.”Each violation is sure proof that the Lord’s coming is close at hand.Like Paul Muad’ib cries when his mother tells him the sisters gave the people something to hope for: “It’s not hope!”Communism is secularized Jewish eschatology; they simply took the God part out to make it universal.Our militant Christian friend Ray has it right, this is a theology of the ancient mystery schools, not solely of Judaic tendencies itself.  The thing is, Semitic brains are particularly prone to this kind of kabbalistic (magical) outlook.The late, murdered Bill Cooper said so in his 1991 book “To Ride A Pale Horse.”As he pointed out, most Jews, like anyone, are decent folk and unaware of the Sabbatian Zevi roots followed by their ruling class.  He mocked the idea of “it’s the Jews,” saying that the globalists are of all races.True, but what he missed is that some populations are notably more prone to such spiritual influence. Also true, of course, is that even though we Whites are more resistant as a group- that is our secret sauce- we are by no means immune.(One can see the internal politico-religious struggle between factions in the Old Testament, along with the questions of identity by the tribes, due to their mixed demographics.  One can see it in the murderous politics of any kingdoms, that is, the human condition.)This realization- that type outweighs race- resolves the vexing question brought up by Jack Dobson: are the Jews using the Puritans, or the Puritans using the Jews?Like attracts like, so the power-mad 2% of dark triad types of any population draw and reinforce each other.  Unfortunately, their social position at the top incentivizes either positive or negative down through the lower ranks.What I resent and resist is some blowhard climbing on top of my shoulders and telling me I’m some sinful sinning sinner who needs to repent and submit. Then they tell me the only solution is to submit to some Jewish god, when they know little and care less, because someBronze Age race propaganda says Aryans are the baddies and its all White woman’s fault.Humility we get, but bowing down to some half-baked midwit pulling a flex is bullsh**.I reject the Bronze Age propaganda.  We aren’t the baddies, and I will not comply.

            The CZs are one big reason that the GOP supports Israel unconditionally. You are quite correct about the CZs attitudes. My late father’s family is full of them and they are diehard supporters of Israel. They are also an example of the fact that there is nothing new under the sun. CZ is a species of the Judaizing heresy, which was the first heresy the Church had to deal with in the first century AD.

                For whatever good Sundance over at The Conservative Treehouse has done, it is all undone by the commentariat over there, quintessential “Christian” Zionists. They remind me of that scene from Monty Python’s Life of Brian where he tries to get his erstwhile followers to accede that they are all individuals to which they all declaim – in unison – “Yes, we are all individuals” in their sycophantic trance.
Can barely stand to visit there anymore.

            The news gelding Joe Scarborough—h/t Matt Taibbi—has gotten marching orders along with the rest of them to compare him to Winston Churchill. I’m frankly all Churchilled out (just like I’m all Lincoln’d out), but Churchill at least could grow facial hair, never went so far as to adopt a black son, and endured his country being bombed.
I always go back to what Bukowski said about Americans. “The problem with these people is that their cities have never been bombed.”

                        How did Churchill start WWII?  He called the shots wrt failed  appeasement policy and had the allies moved against Germany prior to any of the territorial annexations, the war would have been over before it began.  Hell, it could/should have been over when the Rhineland was remilitarized against treaty.  Hitler/Churchill were no saints to be sure and Germany had much reason unite Germans outside of Germany, but that’s beside the point.  The point is simply, Germany could have been stopped before Poland was invaded and the world a better place.  This Churchill was correct about.

                            Germany got completely shafted at Versailles. The Allies were complete hypocrites. Wilson held that all people had a right to “ethnic self-determination” — then he dismembered Germany and create Poland out of what had been Prussia. Not only was Germany geographically partitioned, but it was disarmed in the face of the Jewish/Soviet threat.Who was supposed to guarantee the borders of the new Germany? The League of Nations. Since the U.S. (rightly) failed to join, that meant, for practical purposes, that Britain, which had just defeated Germany in WWI, was going to defend Germany.The entire thing was a complete farce. There was no way that Britain was ever going to give ethnic self-determination o the millions of Germans in Poland and Czechoslovakia, and there was no way Britain had the military ability to guarantee Polish or Czech borders.Churchill was merely using all of this as a pretext to goad Germany into another war. Tellingly, Britain declared war on Germany for invading Poland in 1939 — but not on the USSR for invading Poland.Your comment suggests that your knowledge of this subject is 100% based on the Jewish-controlled postwar narrative. That’s understandable, most Americans know absolutely nothing about interwar European history.I would suggest that you investigate the following to get a better handle on what actually happened: the Hungarian Soviet, the Bavarian Soviet, the Spartacist coup, the Polish Corridor, the Free City of Danzig, and the Battle of Warsaw of 1920 in which the Red Army led by Trotsky nearly defeated Poland and would have marched right into a disarmed Germany had Pilsudski not scored an 11th-hour victory.Understanding this history goes a long wat to explaining Hitler’s anti-Semitism, anti-communism, and geopolitical objectives — none of which should have been the concern of the British whatsoever, but they were chronic meddlers.Britain was actually the “bad guy” in the whole shitshow.

                    Yes, massively so, and worse than that his gross blunders going back to his stance on indiscriminate admission of alien peoples to Great Britain going back to his earliest political stances (Enoch Powell wept…) have been hidden.

        At the national level, perhaps. But I do encourage people to keep voting in state and local elections. Especially for offices like their local elected sheriff. Washington may pass increasingly bizarre and oppressive laws, but it’s your local sheriff who decides which of these mandates actually gets enforced. A dirty little secret is that federal law enforcement agencies are small and don’t know the territory well, so there’s little they can do without the cooperation of local law enforcement. Become ungovernable.

            You assume that the voting process is fair.  Some areas perhaps, but here no.  The machine that fixes Federal elections is *exactly* the same as the machine that fixes the local elections.  As I would refuse to gamble at a crooked Roulette table, I refuse to vote when the party line encouraging the “get out the vote” is, “Beat the Cheat!”.
There have been any number of bills passed—and vetoed—to fix obvious flaws in the current voting process.  Why?
Give me a break…

                    I am not aware of any State where the vote for a State office is relegated to a rural area as vs an urban area.  Yeah, there are County wide elections like for Sheriff, but it seems to make little difference.  One of the most contested races here—for State Attorney General—rested upon a smallish County and a box of *uncounted* votes within that county.  Courts would not allow them to be counted, so the current State Attorney General “won” by a couple hundred votes.

In that order.  I used to think #1 was just tin foil hat stuff, but after reading “The Lobby” by J. Mershimer and seeing what happened in Congress the past couple of days, it’s hard not to go down the rabbit hole.
(I vastly preferred the old saw about how to lose a Congress seat “Get caught with a live boy or a dead girl”.  That used to be dark humor, now it’s hopelessly naive.)

        To put an anonymous face on Z’s description of how candidates are vetted, I know a woman – we’ll call her Sarah because I think Z hates Sarahs – in very Dem area of Northern Virginia.Sarah was always way into politics as most progressives are. She volunteered for campaigns, helped organize events, etc. This was step one in the vetting process. The Dem machine got to know Sarah and her views. This is hugely important. They want true believers. They don’t want to just to control you with money, that’s too dangerous.When her kids got old enough, Sarah decided to run for school board because one of the members has moved on to be state rep. Turns out that it costs between ~$50k or even up to $100k just to run for school board. Where’s Sarah going to get that money? Well, her Dem organization friends know of some people and tell Sarah to call them. No need for walking around asking hundreds of people for $10 donations. Nope, just a couple of phone calls.Sarah makes the calls, gets the money, does actually work hard at campaigning and wins. But now the hooks are fully in. Sarah doesn’t have her own base of money or real support. She has the party. Granted, Sarah doesn’t care. She’s totally on board with them anyway.Four years later, a spot opens up for her to run for state rep. She’s been 100% loyal and has caused zero problems, so the Dem party and the donors back her again. She wins.Sarah is the perfect politician for the party and donors. She’s a true believer. She likes the job. She has no real base of her own. I would also guess that she’s beginning to get hints that some perks could come her way in a few years if she moves up and stays loyal.Now, this is all at a very low level. Imagine the vetting and perks for a congressman or senator.

            True story. Last legislative session, a Dem from the Indian reservation voted for a water bill sponsored by the Rep’s. I heard him explain on the radio his reason and the benefit it would have brought to the reservation. The Dem party has a rule, ‘you vote as we say…period’. Corollary: our Dem Governor vetos every majority Rep Bill passed (140+ vetos first term in office—more than all prior governors *combined*). Obviously, this new Dem Rep was not told this on his first day in office. 🙁Here’s what happened, and to this day I don’t understand *how* this is even possible, he was barred by his Party (Dem) from entering the House to conduct his legally authorized business *physically*! In short, he was expelled for a legal performance of his Constitutional required duty. After a few days, he had a “coming to Jesus” moment and was allowed to take his seat. The Rep’s did nothing!Now, you want me to vote, and by extension, lend support to this political fraud called the democratic process? No thanks.

        I guess word is still out on whether or not Trump actually supported the grotesque $95 billion gibs package, but he is on the record as supporting Israel’s genocide in Gaza and he is on the record as telling people to “shut it down” with regards to the protests of said genocide on college campuses. So, what that says is, at the very least, Kushner-types still have a place in Trump’s inner circle, even if the man himself has been pushed out. It goes without saying, as long as they have a place in his circle, the White man and his interests are secondary.I would have happily voted for Trump as a middle finger to the establishment, as I did in 2016 and 2020, but not after this. The thing is, even if you go beyond Trump and a few others like Massie and Gaetz, what is there? A bunch of clowns waving Ukraine flags and whining about Jewish feelings on Ivy League campuses. The GOP is irredeemable. Z has always been right, you can’t vote your way out of this.

            I don’t know what to make of it. On the one hand, we serve as Israel’s “army on call” and he said he’s against stupid wars. On the other hand, he keeps sucking up to the Jews. Is he just softening them up for some eventual bad news? Who knows anymore.

        In support of this thesis is Counter Currents’ interview with Judd Blevins. The Zero GOP option was discussed.Given the cuck levels of the OK RINOs this seems like the only option. What is worse is the brazen incompetence of the GOP. It is the GOP that has rushed around and legislated, “hate-speech”, laws into existence and done so on behalf of a constituency that votes 85% for the other guy. It is an own goal of epic proportions given that these laws will be used to root out and punish the real enemies of The Regime – The American Remnant. In Europe they even trashed ex-post-facto to jail and disenfranchise Van Langenhoeve. That is coming here thanks to the GOP – the GOP in the heartland whose constituency has zero interest in or support for torching the 1st Amendment.I think I talked myself into zero GOP. Blevins discusses the difficulties in doing so, and how it might work.

Yup. This is what I find very distasteful about all their Israel-simping. This is the very definition of cuckery. Why are they doing political favors for the Jews when they won’t even step up and do anything for their own base?

                Money; Media; Primary Challengers. Any candidate who doesn’t take the money and play ball will find themselves in the next election without any money and with a primary competitor who has the money. You’ll probably face a lot of accusations and controversies that will compound your problems.

        The call for not voting is too simplistic. At the federal level voting is a farce but I would vote for someone like a Matt Gaetz in Florida. He is not going to succeed at changing anything but he puts forward saner positions that normies need to hear such as with the Anti Semitism bill.At the local level, voting can make a huge difference especially with Sheriff. During the Covid hysteria Sheriffs were far more likely to buck the insane rules than police chiefs. There is also no reason why people don’t closely monitor their school board and vote in non insane people to monitor their schools.At a state level voting is less effective although not as worthless as at the federal. During Covid it was much better to live in many red states than blue ones. Red states were also less likely to try and destroy anyone who stood up to antifa and BLM.

                I upvoted you becsuse you’re right, and you went from 15 up votes down to 8. Which means the commentariat is loaded with anti Trump and anti DeSantis self styled intellectual light weights.Someone will be the president in 2024. It does matter. Especially foreign policy where the president has considerable power. Ukraine / possible WWIII. So these intellectual lightweights can only be pro Biden democrats.None of the Anti Trump anti DeSantis trolls here will answer a simple question.Who would you have be president given the choice?Nothing but crickets!

            Agree that local voting can matter. However, if you read my comment, you’ll see that the donor class and the party organization gets its hooks into people earlier than you might think. But, yes, it’s definitely possible that local elections or even state elections (depending on the state) could matter and voting could actually be worthwhile.

        Years ago I read a little noir gem called “Criss Cross” in which several sleazy people put together a heist job. One was an ex-con, another was a sleazy cocktail waitress, and “the mastermind” was a quacklike doctor who claimed he could cure baldness. Every couple chapters there would be a bit of comic relief, with the doctor giving the same poor middle-aged schlub a new vial of tonic that was basically just snake-oil, dextrose and saline with some food coloring, to rub on his head. The novel ended not just with the heist unraveling, but with the still-bald guy showing up at the doctor’s storefront office and shooting the doctor dead just as the fly-by-nighter was getting ready to go to a different town with his carpetbag in tow. The dynamic right now between the Republican pols and their rube normies is very similar. I can only hope that our grifter class and their owners don’t get to flee, either, or that if they do, it’s on one of those new Boeings with the bolt problems.

        Back in 2012 I called it the 25,000,000 Project.  It wouldn’t take every GOP voter to destroy the party.  It would only take a committed 25,000,000 to simply sit things out.  The system would implode.You cannot reform a corrupt system by participating in it.  The logical thing to do is to delegitimize the system by withdrawing your consent.  Their entire business model is built on the fraud of competing parties and agendas.  That’s why the hit the ceiling over the J6 protests.  Those protesters rightly questioned the popular legitimacy of the government by demanding something simple and obvious: a full accounting of the 2020 election fraud that everyone knows took place.The GOP cannot be co-opted or reformed.  It has to be destroyed.Similarly, the Federal bureaucracy that worked so hard to overthrow Trump, and which has turned its weapons on us, has to be gutted.  It cannot be reformed through legislation.  It has to be scalped like a scythe in a wheat field.  Its leaders must be exiled.  Its activities exposed through mass data releases.  Burn Langley to ashes, and I don’t mean that as metaphor, the place needs to be razed.  The FBI?  Gone.And sweeping Diocletian-scale reforms.

                Baby steps.  I don’t think getting the military to mow down the gates at Langley would be as much of a stretch as you think.
The CIA by and large isn’t Americans.  The military is.  Sure, we have bad people at the top of the military.  Take them out, then invite in all the people who were driven off by the woke garbage or the vaccines.
I don’t think it would be all that hard.

                    That is what the OAS conspirators thought. De Gaulle crushed them. The smart bet is that the Military will happily put you into work camps as long as they and theirs are A-OK. No one in the military feels much connection or value to civilians outside their immediate family. And that gets less the longer they are in. Its an all volunteer military. They want this regime.
The military will fight. For the Regime.

                            A large part of the hype over AI is that some people in the elite realize that their DIE hires can’t do the work the Whites used to. To them, the LLMs and machine learning came along just in the nick of time to let them keep pretending that their anti-White policies will not lead to Idiocracy and massive systemic failure.

        One major difference between the parties is the extent to which Democrats reward their friends, reward their lunatics and punish their enemies.Take NPR funding for example.  This is by far the most progressive reasonably mainstream media outlet.  They just recently fired someone who wrote an op-ed about how ridiculously 1 sided NPR is.You can download any funding bill and do a search on it for 000,000 and it’s just one long list of leftist causes. 10 million for this group, 5 million for that group…. To the extent the Republicans do this, it’s their donor class and not their constituents.  Since the Democrats understand how powerful this is, they make sure there is no funding of right wing grassroots causes that are not entirely safe for neoliberal progressivism, like free trade think-tanks.  Of course, even when the GOP has a large majority, the left wing financing never gets interrupted.Just think about all the funding being directed to the people studying “climate change” or promoting electric cars and creating incentives to buy those cars or solar panels.

I agree that Trump is the best candidate we’re going to get at this point.
That said, my main issue with his first term is that he didn’t rely on his own business experience and instincts when it came to staffing his administration. He also needed to do a better job showing loyalty the few reliable staff members he did have.
I don’t think I’m being too unfair with these points.

        My only quibble with today’s show?  The assertion that things can’t get worse.The argument in favor of GOP Zero – the delegitimization of the current system – is that things not only can get worse, they’re about to get much worse.  WW3, shooting in the streets, famine level worse.people are looking for a way to get involved that won’t make them a target of the police state.  Nonparticipation, like the Bud Lite boycott, is how you do this.  Refuse to participate. Although they’re trying hard to jail Trump for non crimes, for the most part sitting in your hands is harmless.As Batman says to the villain in “Batman Begins”, “I’m not going to kill you.  But I don’t have to save you.”  The train goes off the rails and explodes, killing the villain.stop saving them.

        I don’t like this new upvote/downvote system.
The smile/frown system was better for gauging the communities’ overall attitude.
By seeing the total votes each side, you could tell whether or not an opinion was splitting the forum.
Under the new system, a controversial comment with an equal number of up/down votes is indistinguishable from a vapid, but inoffensive comment that is being ignored by the readers.

                What I’m seeing on my IPad is a response delay of sorts hitting the buttons.  Could be me and this damn Ipad, but it causes me to double hit a lot and then wait for a response. I don’t see this delay when typing a message, only when hitting a button for a vote or to expand a message—that’s assuming the button senses a hit, sometimes it seems nothing happens at all.

        …when I consider the extream corruption prevalent among all orders of men in this old rotten State…I cannot but apprehend more mischief than benefit from a closer union. I fear they will drag us after them in all the plundering wars which their desperate circumstances, injustice and rapacity may prompt them to undertake; and their wide-wasting prodigality and profusion is a gulph that will swallow up every aid we may distress ourselves to afford them. Here numberless and needless places, enormous salaries, pensions, perquisites, bribes, groundless quarrels, foolish expeditions, false accounts or no accounts, contracts and jobs devour all revenue, and produce continual necessity in the midst of natural plenty. I apprehend, therefore, that to unite us intimately will only be to corrupt and poison us also.Benjamin Franklin to Joseph Galloway, 1775.

        A realistic vision of redemption and rebirth with minimum harm.The elites continue accelerating the bust out and rob the country blind while printing infinite fake money and sending inflation through the roof. Then one day, interest on the mega-trillion dollar debt starts a vicious cycle that collapses the economy. Chaos ensues.Rather than play the game of pleb-on-pleb violence leading to a jackboot fueled imposition of techno-tyranny, an enlightened cohort of the population decides to focus on the root of the problem (as clearly identified in today post). The pathogens must go, which is the parachute they have been preparing as their fallback option (lots of bunkers being build outside the continental USA). How best to start the stampede for the exits?Smarter rather than harder. Creativity, innovation, hard work, focus, and spontaneity.It won’t take much. They are cowards and incompetents. And they will shit their pants at the first sign of real accountability. Let the Lear jets fly and never come back.

            Right.  I was just listening to the part where Z says “Clinton never started any wars”, and I literally screamed at the blue tooth speaker, “Are you kidding me?”  Clinton was the first POTUS to use NATO as an offensive weapon.  He was the first to begin pushing NATO eastward.  His fingerprints are all over the current debacle in Ukraine. And this is not even counting his domestic “wars” against rural whites at Waco and Ruby Ridge, which have only intensified in recent years.  Please, Z.

        Problem with our political system is we assume the politicians are in charge. But the system has six ways from Sunday to get back at politicians who don’t cooperate(to paraphrase Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer referring to the intelligence agencies). President Donald Trump provides numerous examples of this. Better to think of such politicians as the neighborhood pimp. They strut about flaunting their luxurious lifestyle and talking big; but they don’t run the neighborhood. The voters, who are the whores in this analogy, are apt to blame the politicians prancing about in front of them for the pain they’re experiencing when they get it from behind courtesy of the pimp’s paymasters—the folks who actually run things.

        What’s always bothered me most about voting, the reason I’ve never done it*, is its humiliating disproportion.This week the government made it illegal (I guess?) to object to the behavior, past or present, of its rich criminal friends. A proportionate response from the people would be to build an unprecedented number of ovens. But all we’re allowed to do is wait a few months and pick one from a list of politicians all wholly owned by the same criminals. And our votes won’t be counted if the criminals don’t like them.The moral, mathematical, and practical political arguments for or against voting are all beside the point. Don’t do it to *yourself*.*In2020 and ’22 someone registered me as a Democrat and voted, my state says, which at least has spared me from the threatening “Your neighbors know if you voted” [overhead picture of your house] mailers the local Democrats send out, and maybe will get me taken off the roundup list.

        So the plan is we throw open the gates to power to the barbarians who will grant citizenship to 50+ million foreigners, enact confiscatory taxes,  expand the judiciary with unga bunga judges to rubber stamp it all and thenenforce DIE at all levels at the point of a gun.  And after all that is done we can rally the troops to initiate a cycle of reform?

            This is the work of the Devil. He has you thinking that the choice at the ballot box is some specific thing you do not want versus some undefined thing that you believe you will like. In reality, the choice is some specific thing you do not want versus that same thing but passed by Republicans.
When you vote, the choice is not whether you get kicked in the groin or not. You are voting for who gets to kick you in the groin

            The 50 million foreigners is what the “not voting” people fail to consider.  Without that outside influence, it might be a good strategy but if Biden stays in, then this flood we have experienced over the last 3 years will accelerate.  The open borders maniacs are quite serious about it.   Not just relatively benign Mexicans but Sub Saharan Africans, Haitians and millions of pajeets.   Those newcomers will not be impressed by our lack of voting.   And there is a difference between Trump and some of the GOP and the nuts in the Democratic Party on this issue.

            DeSantis, while an effective governor, is about the worst campaigner I have ever seen. Which helps bring into focus one major flaw in the American “democratic” model: Too many voters are brainless morons who are more persuaded by style than by substance. Caring more about what a politician says (or how he looks) this year than for what he has done for the past 20 years. Or 50 years. And steered into that “conclusion” by a media complex that wants them to see it that way.

                The sea of absolute morons in society that continually vote against their interests is the single best argument in favor of a highly restrictive, limited franchise.
Sadly, I don’t think it is possible to return to that condition in the current system.

                Carlin said it best: “Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that.” Yes, I know he was a liberal puke, but 70s era liberal pukes sometimes pointed out, quite astutely, problems with society. The issue, often, was that they misunderstood the solution

                        In the leftist worldview, the average white denizen of the trailer park deserves to wallow in abject poverty because he is lazy and willfully ignorant. The average black ghetto dweller, on the other hand, does not deserve to be destitute because he is deprived of an education and job opportunities because of white racism and lack of government funding.

            “It’s OK to stop believing but it’s not good to stop voting.”
if the process is fair, rather than corrupt, possibly.  There lies the rub.  Florida has corrected a great many process errors in their elections.  This is not the case in my State.  I refuse to partake in an election process riddled with potential points of fraud—which were arguably put in precisely for that purpose.
When will you stop voting?  When the opposition candidate gets 90%+ of the vote as in Russia?  Answer that question for yourself.

        Zippy made the point that even if you’re vote “counted”, the process of voting has made it so the normal man is putting his mark, his seal of approval on the system, and thus all the system does. He calls it a formal cooperation with evil:“Voting in mass-market universal suffrage elections is necessarily an idealistic act: it literally,in principle as the kind of act it is, cannot be a pragmatic act. It is literally irrational, an act whichgoes against right reason, to vote for President (or other national office or mass market referendum) under some pragmatic “vote to limit evil” calculus based on weighing potential bad outcomes against worse outcomes. “”I conclude that aproportionate reasonto votein our current circumstancesdoes not exist: not for anyone, because the outcome-independent considerations apply to everyone, and even if there were an exception or two through some loophole in some argument somewhere, the near-universality would preclude the act because of scandal. In fact I think the scandal at the very first bus stop – the fact that the great majority of people formally cooperate with grave evil when they vote – is sufficient to preclude any proportionate reason for anyone who has gotten this far to vote.”

        Another zippy quote“In my view it is those who choose to vote who have no right – or at least a much more attenuated right – to complain. They have personally endorsed the governing consensus and the process by which that governing consensus is made legitimate. Someone who refuses to personally endorse the governing consensus in a concrete act hasgreaterright to complain, notlesser.Someone who refuses to work for Planned Parenthood has a greater right to complain about abortionSomeone who refuses to fight in an unjust war has a greater right to complain about the unjust warSomeone who refuses to eat processed food has a greater right to complain about processed foodSomeone who refuses to buy products made in sweatshops has a greater right to complain about sweatshopsI could keep making this list forever. But the point is that one entry on this potentially infinite list isSomeone who refuses to endorse the political consensus by voting has a greater right to complain about the political consensushttps://zippycatholic.wordpress.com/2012/10/19/licensed-to-gripe/

        I remember when it was a fad for candidates seeking office to pledge to only serve a term or two and resign. Then of course the winners would be convinced by their “colleagues” they had to stay. Maybe one or two kept their word to quit. I wonder if there was an accounting of which representatives flip-flopped.

            Indeed.  Read about those Federal elected during the early start of the country.  The offices of Congress paid little, the travel to the Capitol was long and arduous, the work unrewarding, and the local housing conditions terrible.  Those who ran for office did so as a *civic duty*, but also as a loss in personal wealth.  No need for term limits.  😉

        Zero seats in the US is a very, very bad idea. In the UK it might not be bad, but in the US it will be very, very bad.Zero seats means the express train to the Hillary! Plan for “re-education camps” for White people. With all that implies.Nor is there any way to “reform.” Let us be honest. There is not. Nor will there be peaceful separation. Let us be honest — will never happen.No, we cannot vote our way out of trouble. Whites will be forever forward, in all countries including European ones, a discriminated fifth class minority. That is baked into the demographics, the people already here who will bring relatives/friends in, the reality of the situation. We will be discriminated against and expected to generate the wealth (which we will never share) and do all the fighting. However …We can survive. Survival is better than not surviving. We can and should seek allies that benefit us for survival, when and where we can. This applies to certain groups both political and religious. Zero seats will mean ALL brakes off for the “Complete Solution” to the problem of White people existing.

            On the contrary, I think peaceful separation has a chance. Primarily because AINO residents, to include the “leaders” and the military, have become too soft, meek, complacent, comfortable and titty sucking to fight against it.

                The most capital mistake is to underestimate your enemy. Someone like Jabba the Hutt want to be Victoria Nuland may be obese and stupid, but her will to have you dead is iron. And people like her command a vast, expanded “covert” army of CIA “contractors” (basically ex Spec Ops) and so one very well versed in training paramilitaries.They have an unlimited supply of third world mercenaries who like hurting and killing people and will do it for free much less pay.They need White guys as both objects of mutual hate of the Coalition of the Ascendant (gays, lesbians, sassy obese black women, the Alphabet ++++++ and so on as well as our wealth and manpower for the draft.Macron is again saying he will send troops, and reportedly there are more trial balloons going up on the draft.

            Those things are already in the plans for us.  Look at what the enemy did in Australia during COVID, and what New York is currently doing to Trump.  We’re already there, dude.  We need to stop pretending these people want anything for us other than death and prison.  I see no value in the GOP approach which is the exact same thing the enemy wants, just slower.  What’s better?  Concentration camps in 15 years or concentration camps in 15 months?Maybe we need to break the abusive relationship and delegitimize the government.  They’re already getting everything they want, and we’re helping them do it.

        In the last minute of the podcast talking about how systems move easily to something really ugly, while true is never really appreciated by the right, either the mainstream “right” or even the dissident right.If things got ugly and the balloon went up, we are far more likely to get the soviet union and a lennin or Stalin than a Thomas Jefferson.  The “right” is completely delusional with their AKs and think they can win or will win a “civil war”  While there are no shortages of small arms or ammo on the “right” side, there is virtually zero organization and nobody with enough purchase across the right spectrum to rise into effective leadership and build an organizational ability.  The right would be absolutely crushed just as Whites are being crushed because we fail to build a team.  This is why the left immediately spends enormous resources to fight any minor attempt at uniting even a small number of White people around their being White. They understand the power of organizations and a large hierarchical structure like, say, the military or policing.Sadly, I don’t think there is any other choice.  If we went through all the trouble of organizing the broad right into boycotting elections and then using the resulting vacuum to create a new right party, the usual suspects would jump right to the head and pretend it was all their idea all along and lead us right into a cul-de-sac or over a cliff.  They would dump money into the new party and take it over.There isn’t even a strong possibility of any rightist organization taking over if the current system severely breaks.  I think a lot of people look at the system breaking as the only real way we have to even fight, let alone win.  But just look at China. There are many people who go years without ever getting paid. You see these protests demanding their rights to their pay from the last 18 or 24 months.  The bureaucrats, police, agencies etc will still go to work even if there is no money for pay.  They will pay them something, (they will also promise future pay) even if it is just enough to buy food and fuel and they will go to work.

            The Chinese system is not broken, nor special to the Chinese.  If you’ve no other recourse to buy food or pay rent, you will work for those items—even if in a time gone by your physical effort was considered worth more than simply a meal and a cot.  In the great depression, lots of people worked for a meal and a spot in the barn.  Our system, the “welfare” State, is what’s broken as we have people who consider themselves better off not working, than working, and employers are force to pay wages in excess of value of the worker.

                The point I was trying to make is that people imagine that if the gov runs out of money, state actors will stop acting. Like the PD is going to go home if they don’t get their full paychecks. Not only do they have to eat, but this is what they do every day. It’s their lives. They’re not going to just refuse to go to work. Even if they did in large enough numbers, they would very likely be ordered back to work.IMHO, welfare is not a problem compared to government employees and people only employed because of government. Welfare is the least of our problems. We send them a check and that is what it costs. There are sometimes other costs, like criminality enabled by it or pregnancies that wouldn’t otherwise happen, but it’s pretty limited. The far bigger cost of welfare is we now import foreigners to do the jobs these people used to be forced by economic necessity to do. Of course, all those social costs are pushed onto everyone else while the employer gets cheap foreign labor.There are millions of people who go to work every day imposing not only their own costs of being employed, but an additional burden above and beyond what it costs to employ them. Think about the bureaucrat who said that unclogging a drain was destruction of a federally protected wetland. This case went to scotus twice!!! The bureaucrat probably makes under 200k a year. This case has likely costed well over 5 million Dollars. That would be 25 times their salary. Look at the costs IRS employees impose above and beyond the tax burden. Just try to imagine what all the banking rules cost the economy. Every bank has to employ what are effectively government agents to prevent or detect things like depositing or withdrawing the non-correct amounts of money (stacking). They have to keep the records for long periods of time. They have to do background checks etc.

                    Tars, you need to go to the published stat’s, albeit there are myriad ways of calculating just who is on welfare, and we might disagree just what is “welfare”, the Fed stat’s proudly announce over $1.2T spent in 2022.  The total number of government employees—Fed, State, Local—is less than 22M.  Fed—and State and Local—employees don’t amount to a hill of beans in welfare state expenditures, although the level of waste they represent is huge compared to private enterprise.

            I submit that no AINO leader or potential leader possesses either the will or the means to crack down like Lenin or Stalin. Their fear of casualties prevents them from winning any war anywhere, let alone here. The military is not even capable of occupying its own country, assuming it had the will, which it doesn’t. The people of Boston and SF Bay are not going to send their sons and daughters to fight to conquer Mississippi. Or vice versa. The scaremongering about the regime organizing an immigrant army is ROFL ridiculous. They couldn’t organize a bake sale.But a sufficiently megalomaniacal leader, who I doubt exists, could do drone strikes on the opposition. For a little while.

                On the contrary, they were successful in Ukraine using the same tactics, also Georgia, Armenia, Poland, Ireland, etc.They put “enough” local leaders on the payroll, at much higher pay than they could elsewhere. They recruit the bio Leninist worst of the worst to commit awful things. Then they use the chaos to install the New World Order led by some pliant too. It is the Color Revolution playbook and one well known and very effective.What it cannot do is run up against an industrial near peer state that can push a lot artillery and manpower up against it. For that they have no answer. But their record is pretty solid in creating regimes and sustaining them against internal threats.

                You’re making the same mistake almost all conservatives make, which is to assume a “civil war” would play out between patriots and the military.  The ONLY way that happens is if some of the states get in on it and declare independence from the federation.  This is highly unlikely IMHO under any foreseeable future..I don’t think this is how anything remotely resembling a civil war would look like. It wouldn’t be against the military, at least not primarily. It would be against the cops.  That’s not to say extra bodies cannot be brought in from the military under specific circumstances.The military is simply the wrong tool to fight an insurgency.  The military is very, very good at breaking big stuff.  Breaking big stuff would only help the insurgency.  The enormous police state which far outnumbers the military is far better trained and equipped and experienced to fight an insurgency.  The MPs working at bases as police are probably much better equipped to fight such an insurgency than the troop they police.Imagine some “patriots” in this future war decided to take out some electrical stations to cause chaos in the cities.  The FBI, state police and various experts recruited on a contract basis (which is how it works now) from the local universities can all work together and find out who did it.  The armed forces simply do not have this expertise and ability.  It’s not what they do.  The press and government can call them white supremacist terrorists as 20 of the suspects are perpwalked into prison on the six o’clock news.  The “right” is not even ready to be called “White supremacist terrorists” let alone have the organizational ability to avoid all this.  Their own children will be subject to this propaganda at school.  Imagine being a patriot and your kid comes home from school talking how we have to capture and kill the terrorists.  Do you take the chance and tell your kid it is all propaganda and maybe he slips up and tells the wrong person?All the things that prevent people from fighting with words will stop them from fighting with weapons.

                    As I envision the states drifting apart, I envision their cops drifting with them. A process, not an event. The federal government possessing the technological means, but critically not the will, to prevent it. I’m not futurecasting. This is a process already underway.

        Schrodingers cat on data collection–suppose you have- not a cat, but a hand grenade, in a shoebox on the top shelf of your closet. The hand grenade can be deadly or benign, until the box gets opened no one cares. As long as no one opens the box and takes the pin out, you are perfectly safe. The data may have been collected/stored about your hand grenade, but until a fedgov human has a reason to notice that, and dispatches another fedgov human or two to do something about it, you are still safe and the box is still both deadly and benign. With the level of incompetence and lack of manpower to follow thru, how much real danger does the box pose?

        G0P is a good idea, but 0 looks so close to O thatGZPorGØPwill be better.G{}Palso could raise awareness, or at least anger crapservatards when they have it explained to them.Not so good is your axiomatic premise that “There’s no way you can prove a negative” (40:50). We hear it and read it again and again, year after year, from European Americans—who will deserve to be shit upon by the Party to which they pay taxes until they don’t deserve shit. You remembered your mathematics and other studies, though, so you contradicted your impossibility axiom by adding that “I mean, it’s just about impossible.” That’s thinking on your feet.Also not so good is the generalization that “they are litterly banning religion now” (58:11). You have no evidence for that. None. Zero. Ø. {}.Are rabbis’ religions being bannned?? Or David Ben-Gurion’s? You could say truthfully that sects of Christianity will come under much greater pressure from the nation of Israel, but “Christianity” is not a synonym for religion.A better case could be made that Jewish supremacy is herding Ameritards into Noahism, about which Adam Green (Know More News) often talks. A valid objection against the AAA is that Samaritanism, Karaitism, Talmudism, Conservatism, and Reformism need to be criminalized and crushed before we crush Israel’s cult of Jesus. Strike the root, you know?P.S. One of the most impressive works of classsical civ includes a number theory proof about an impossibility. I think it’s 20 in IX, but don’t quote me on this detail. Anyhow, the author proved a negative. He showed that it’s not possible to make a complete list of a special type of integer. What’s important politically here is what the proof implies theologically. It means that stupid “white” Americans are all wrong when they squawk that all things are possible with their Shemitic god. Handfuls ofancient scribblingare so childishly incorrect that they ought not to be held in the hands of anyone other than unabrahamists.

        This one is interesting:”Suppose we are contemplating doing act X in order to block a big evil E, where X is not intrinsically evil but doing it involves remote material cooperation with evil.A proportionate reason to do X obtains when (1) X is reasonably effective in stopping E without being excessive, and (2) stopping E does not produce evils and disorders graver than E.Folks tend to make a reasonable case for (2): that is, they make a reasonable case (lets stipulate, in case you disagree) thatMcCain winningdoes not produce evils and disorders graver than those which would follow fromObama winning.But there is a very strong tendency to ignore (1) completely, treating an act of voting as if it were precisely the same thing as making McCain win by fiat. That isn’t thekind of thingthat voting is though: it has very little actual efficacy in making one’s favored candidate win, and yet it has quite a bit of efficacy in exercising influence over the person who votes himself and those within his immediate sphere of influence.”https://zippycatholic.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/what-the-heck-is-a-proportionate-reason-anyway/

        “It is clear that the people in the white working and middle class no longer have any options at the ballot box save for one.”Trump!Trump just came out and said anti whiteism is a problem, and he’s going to take on anti white discrimination, by enforcing existing civil rights law. Effectively killing DEI.It doesn’t mean he is the great white hope. If he wins at the ballot box, he probably won’t be seated in the oval office.The beauty of Trump is he throws issues on the table no other politician will touch, no person in the country has a bigger megaphone than Trump.The media will pick up the ball and run with it. The genie cannot be put back in the bottle.Kudos also to Matt Walsh, for being the only other white guy in the country with any sizeable public platform for having the balls to take on anti white racism. DEI is dead!

            The Ism dragon remains fearsome enough to cause all of these skittish culture warriors to runaway, but it is encouraging to see them inch closer to the dragon anyway. The racism snorts from the dragon are now least effective, but the trouble is these culture warriors, guys like Rufo, do not see a dragon, but Medusa. They are certain that all they need to do is show this monster its reflection and the game is won. The dragon finds this amusing.

If they are unreasonable and continue to fck with us, be prepared to say: bring it. Then see if they do.Most of the events for which this year will be rembered have not happened yet, but I think the this antisemiteism bill is one of them.

            Trump is about 4 years behind the dissident space, and about 2 years ahead of the normie space. Even Charlie Kirk was going on about ant-white bias in 2020; Trump just picked up on it now. That just means that the peasant griller will now use “anti-white” casually in conversation at the dinner table. It’s a W, and DEI is not long for this world.Trump already has one foot in the anti-MIC pool; just wait until he criticizes the Israel lobby (which he will, in about 4 years, saying “I love Israel, but…) and then we’re going to get the final death rattle of American philo-semitism before the Hindus take charge and Congress passes an act that bans criticism of hygiene.

            Trump, at best, is a relief valve. A very flawed one too. His real priorities are: being seen as The Big Boss, doing as much as possible for Israel and appealing to blacks.At the same time, he is great at rallying and uniting the nutcases on the left.

                                Trump’s not a Superman, but he is a disruptor that magnifies the worst in the Leftist opposition for all to see.  For this he gets my vote, and he would be the only one to get me to the polls again.
Contradiction of my prior posts, yes!  Reason, I want to see how they (Leftists) overthrow his (apparent) ascendancy to the office.

                                    It’s a tradeoff, I think. Your reason is the only reasonable one to vote. OTOH, even voting for Trump will be taken in most quarters as assent for the system to govern us. Like I said, a tradeoff.

                        To the extent they were railroaded for drug crimes, I was all for it. That war is lost and no sense in continuing to punish people for something the majority seems to do anyway. (I don’t.) I don’t think too many other crime categories were given a break, though.

But my main disagreement is that there is substance and there is show.  Invite all the minorities you want to the WH.  Pardon a bunch if you want.  This is typical political theater.  We have to see what substance he brings to the show.He successfully closed the border once, can he do it again?  Can he drive those IA’s now here out again? (doubtful)  Can he keep us out of war and get our military back within our borders?  Can he balance a budget?Substance. Your objection seems with theater which you claim indicates a lack of substance.  We shall see.

                            I didn’t see where Trump said he’s pardon the J6ers. If he did, good for him.
As for theater, all I can say is that theater IS substance. Imagery influences people. It is often the most potent form of propaganda. And everybody on the DR has seen what 50-plus years of anti-white propaganda has done to us. Trump’s very prominent negrophilia simply feeds into the postmodern Leftist zeitgeist. And that’s the last thing white people need from their erstwhile savior.
