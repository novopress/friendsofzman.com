        Great pieces so far. Part Deux is why I got so excited about Trump. Finally, a not-politician who can run un-bought, who knows how to find the right people to get the job done; understands his limitations and hires accordingly – why, it almost sounds like this country might have a chance after all!Is it possible that this guy can jam the gears of the Machine? Is there even a reverse gear on this thing anymore? Can a country Progressing to the point of no return save itself?Tune in next year for the exciting conclusion.

        This philosophy was also picked up by the German Army after WWI.
Thus Hans von Seeckt’s policy:
[To make] of each individual member of the army a soldier who, in character, capability, and knowledge, is self-reliant, self-confident, dedicated, and joyful in taking responsibility [verantwortungsfreudig] as a man and a soldier.

        “The great innovation Americans brought to war fighting is the prioritization of training over discipline. Put another way, the prioritization of what gets done over how it gets done. Soldiers and officers are encouraged to be creative in their problem solving and be mission focused.”This was not an American innovation; it was developed by the Germans as Auftragstaktik in the 19th century.  It may be true, however, that something like it was adopted by the Marines at Belleau Wood; the Marines have, in many respects, always been the most innovative branch of the U.S.military.It has been pointed out already, but Adams was actually a Unitarian. But he may also have been a prig. Modern Unitarians often are, albeit in a very different way.

        Ah, this second post makes the first one clear. Maybe they belong together though short posts are easier to digest, I suppose. So it’s Perfection versus Making do. Got it.

        […] The developers, meanwhile, fail to take on the entrepreneurial, masculine spirit of responsibility.  They assume that the systems which they worked under in the corporate world are innate aspects of reality, rather than the modern cult of control developed by Utopian fetishists.  The Z Man describes the entrepreneurial system thusly: […]

        “Perfection is for the after life. In this life, human error is a feature, not a bug.”
God, I hate to use a quote beloved of Jonah Goldberg, but it’s too good not to:
“DON’T immanentize the eschaton!!”

        Spot on, but John Adams would agree with you. He was a prig, not a Puritan.“A man must be indifferent to the sneers of modern Englishmen.” The ruling class of the day.“Our constitution was made for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.” He is telling us from the grave that our Constitution, both living and dead, are now an abomination.“The government turns every contingency into an excuse for having power for itself.” And that was then.“There is danger from all men. The only maxim of a free government ought to be to trust no man living with power to endanger the public safety. ” An elected Emperor is still an Emperor.It was Hamilton alone who loved the concept of powerful central government. His arguments in The Federalist that central government under the Constitution would be well contained were masterful deceptions. He was  native neither to the culture of the North or the South, and his parentage too was uncertain.
