        Facts and reason are totally ineffective on liberals.  I have, however, had some limited success with pliers and a blowtorch.

        I’m thinking Eich was a soft target.  I never heard of him and wouldn’t care what his feelings are personally.  It’s a chipping away at what the left sees at the opposition.  Silence the little guy.  In the past I’d say this type of thing is off in the distant and doesn’t affect me.  But now I’ve come to realize it’s getting closer and closer to where I may not have or express opinions openly.  I think that’s where this has the potential to go.  That is what scares me.  Where have we seen this before?

        America’s feminine fascist future sounds about right, maybe Hunger Games and Divergent aren’t so far off the mark. But I’d add that whites will eventually be far more authoritarian, violent, and repressive than usually occurs under Latin authoritarian leaders. The tide of illegal aliens will turn – it’s beginning to already – as America’s instability become ever more apparent.Your analysis, and Williamson’s, is basically spot on. The Left in America is a real and growing threat that should concern the world. Soetoro has accelerated America’s fall into leftist liberal fascism, you see it in a thousand small ways in America today.I also agree that Jonah Goldberg shares the commendable and common delusion of the right that one can convince liberals. You can’t, it’s like negotiating with Palestinians.And last, it seems very unlikely that the right in the USA will change their ways, they’ll continue bowing their head before their executioners while wondering how it all could go so wrong. What shelters liberals and disarms conservatives is the cult of American exceptionalism, which added to the normalcy bias, makes it impossible for most Americans, leftists and conservatives alike, to believe that the current mess in American political life won’t eventually be resolved. It truly won’t be, because the Left is not interested in a resolution.The general decline will continue, the executive’s use of bureaucratic departments as instruments of political surveillance and repression will escalate. And the right has little inclination to reverse that tide. So it’ll likely keep getting worse until the economy collapses, or something worse.

        ” The problem is they are all like Jonah Goldberg. They make wonderful arguments in defense of civilization.”
What utter bollocks, the clown is a rabid Zionist perfectly prepared to usher America into fascism if it achieves his goals.
