        In a humane and reasonable society there could be a discussion about how funding needs to be set aside for people when they get old and can‚Äôt work. There could be serious talk about how maybe FDR‚Äôs old Ponzi scheme wasn‚Äôt the best way to do this and how, with longer lifespans, people need to consider limiting the government funded retirement program for those who truly need it and perhaps encouraging people to set up elder-care funds for their parents and themselves. Perhaps tax incentives could be used to encourage funding this.At this point though I‚Äôm not even angry anymore that nothing remotely like this will ever (or could ever) happen. I actually want Biden seize whatever‚Äôs left in the SS fund, convert it into crisp new $20 bills, and air drop it directly over Ukraine. After that I want him to conscript everyone‚Äôs grandma into an improvised paratroop force and airdrop them directly into Bakhmut. He should also make sure that there‚Äôs no actual money left for the parachutes and then make a rambling half-apology on TV for splattering all those grannies before the Russians even got a chance to shoot them. Finally, he should set fire to the Capitol building while playing ‚ÄúThe Devil Went Down to Georgia‚Äù on the fiddle.I give it about a 40% chance that if he did ALL THAT, the grillers might revolt.

            If you know Biden you know that he never takes responsibility for anything. It‚Äôs always someone else‚Äôs fault. Often he gets furious at having his mistakes pointed out. This p.o.s. is a nasty piece of work.

        You know, it‚Äôs always been a little hard for me to swallow the idea that the GOP is just there only to play the ‚Äúfoil‚Äù in a carefully scripted drama, but yes, calls to eliminate social security sure do pull back the curtain on Oz‚Äôs inner workings.I‚Äôll be the first to say that Social Security is a broken system, and that they probably could have done better way back when at creating it. But what percentage of voters are in favor of eliminating it at this point? 5%? Less? Even most people in the 100k-200k/year earning category have factored in social security into their retirement plans. And they‚Äôve all payed into it, their entire lives. Ending it completely? Lmao nuts

            1-200k  that seems like a lot &amp; it used to be at least upper middle class.It ain‚Äôt what it used to be.My wife and I worked 24-7 since we were teens. Took calculated risks  &amp; opportunities when we were able to recognize them. Never bought anything new if used would do. Road or camping trips when we were able to take a rare vacation.  Avoided all the usual pitfalls drugs alcohol gambling etc..Up until a few years ago were starting to feel a little secure and imagined a light at the end of the tunnel.Now‚Ä¶   not so much.Still have some hope though.Hope to die standing with boots on.

                The total cost of housing (principal, interest, taxes, maintenance, acts of God) is really starting to bite those in the 100 to 200k gross income range.
Personally, I‚Äôm somewhat regretting not taking a recent opportunity to move to a lower cost of living area even though a job in those parts was not a foregone conclusion.

        What are the chances? No one in the GOP gives a fig about fiscal matters or budgetary constraints so it‚Äôs something else. The democrats just about a month ago said the usual about the GOP wanting to knock off grandma, and lo and behold Pompeo delivers the goods. What‚Äôs left to do is figure out what the con is. My bet is that he‚Äôs being used to generate campaign donations for another GOP hopeful who will roundly proclaim, ‚ÄúPompeo is just wrong and‚Ä¶ blah, blah, blah. I‚Äôd also look at the democrats funding to see if they need a little boost from their people to ‚Äúsave grandma‚Äù and will in turn kick back to Pompeo.

        Love it. This is exactly why I don‚Äôt cast votes for people (you put a law or policy on the ballot and I‚Äôll toss my yea or nay in).Ya, democracy means I get to help pick in a popularity contest where the contestants are chosen by their money and connections in relationship to what‚Äôs decided to be acceptable by a class of people who are so far from normal they might as well be lizard/alien hybrids. Then the person that gets picked goes on to toe the party line and not actually vote for or create legislature that benefits me. Real neat.

        ‚ÄúMike Pompeo is running for president, so he shows up to give a speech. In his speech, he promises to throw old people off the Social Security and Medicare system.‚Äù
These people have been contributing to SS and Medicare their whole lives. Now Pompeo ‚Äî an avatar for the Deep State ‚Äî wants to strip them of these things. The empire wants its denizens to contribute their sweat and toil to feed the insatiable maw of the war machine. In return the denizens get nothing. Pompeo and the rest of the political class deserve the fate of Ceausescu

            Social Security was always intended to be a way to rip off the peasants.  It was established back in the 1935 with the idea that most people only live to 65.  You pay into the system your whole life collect for a few months, and then heart attack.  Then the government can take the rest of that money you paid ‚Äúinto the system‚Äù and do whatever it wants.  And it did, that‚Äôs why social security is always on the verge of collapse: they already spent the money.  We‚Äôre just finally reaching the point where the public opens the briefcase only to find it full of slips of paper, being subsequently informed that those are IOUs and just as good as money, sir.

                ‚Äúonly to find it full of slips of paper, being subsequently informed that those are IOUs and just as good as money‚ÄùI think GWB informed the peasants around 20 years ago that the SS trust fund contained only IOUs. This is why I think SS is even more vile than a mere Ponzi scheme.Still, have to be philosophical about this. This is part of the lifecycle of disintegrating empires. When the Soviet Union went down, the pensioners were being paid in increasingly worthless rubles. When I wandered around parts of the old Soviet Union in the early 90s I used to see old-age pensioners standing from dawn to dusk trying to sell a pair of socks or a couple of apples or some plastic shopping bags.

                Plopped.  Your (mis)understanding of the SSI system is profound.Yes, it‚Äôs not actuarial sound.  No, it won‚Äôt go ‚Äúbroke‚Äù and disappear‚Äîunless Congress acts to replace it.  It has its own funding source‚Äîyes, modeled after Ponzi, but able at this time estimated to fund 75% of current benefits on an ongoing basis.The box of ‚ÄúIOU‚Äôs‚Äù you refer to has been currently *opened*!  Every month several billon dollars of Treasury notes are redeemed and used to pay benefits.  This has been going on for some time now.  The Treasury simply sells notes to someone else and pays up.  These Treasury notes (invested surpluses from the 1980‚Äôs reform act) were due to run out in 2030.  I assume with inflation and a recession, it will run out much sooner.  Again, at that time, the Fed‚Äôs kick in difference between income and outgo or the benefits are cut across the board (estimated at 25% cut, but could be more with inflation)

        There‚Äôs another reason for Mike Pompeii and republicans to be talking about cutting old people off social security and Medicare. It‚Äôs just another example of republicans trying their best to throw what should be a slam dunk election for them. Can‚Äôt upset their lefty overlords in the uniparty. Plus, we can‚Äôt forget that they even said out loud that they like being the party out of power because when they are in power, people actually expect them to do stuff. Skyrocket crime, inflation, radical gender theory being taught to elementary school kids, flowering anti-white hatred‚Ä¶should we talk about any of these? No, that may help us win an election, let‚Äôs talk about kicking old people off Medicare.We can pay for pensions in Ukraine, but not social security. We can pay for billions of aid packages all around the world to third world countries, but not Medicare. Republicans love telling us certain items that normal people enjoy are ‚Äúinsolvent,‚Äù but the trillions going to the military industrial complex and making their executives filthy rich are ‚Äúnecessary.‚Äù Here‚Äôs another one they make noises about: the postal service. Survey after survey shows Americans like getting their mail, and it‚Äôs generally the highest rated federal agency. Republicans take this as a signal that they should attack it, lest people think they‚Äôre normal people.

        I seem to be a unicorn once again ‚Äì an old White lady who wishes both Social Security and Medicare were abolished.  Yes, I understand people paid in ‚Äì my wages were garnished every year since I was 16 just like most of you.  But to assume people would have saved that money themselves and invested it and therefore what they paid in plus interest is ‚Äòtheirs‚Äô is lunacy.  Yes, I am also well aware of the constant devaluation of the dollar and that the sums paid in back in the ‚Äô70s and ‚Äô80s and ‚Äô90s are worth more in today‚Äôs highly inflated fiat bucks.But plenty of silents and boomers have received far more from SS than they ever paid.  Regardless, it was a Ponzi scheme from the get-go.  Good luck convincing Juan and Vivek they owe old Whites any sort of financial security.  Not to mention that a healthy White society would put more money and care into its young, rather than endlessly extending the life of the old.  No, I‚Äôm not saying throw grandma in the street, but a health society prioritizes future generations.As far as Medicare, I‚Äôm essentially being forced to apply for it and I don‚Äôt want it.  I absolutely agree with Whites getting whatever they can from America‚Äôs dying carcass, and I abhor our insurance/medical complex, but I don‚Äôt want any further government controlled healthcare in the guise of Medicare largesse.Of course almost all welfare should end ‚Äì and all foreign aid (I‚Äôm with Davy Crockett on that one).  But almost all of fedgov‚Äôs expenditures go to buy votes both domestic and foreign: food stamps and welfare for blaqs, social security nd medicare for White silents and boomers, and sending taxpayer money to Our Greatest Ally to satisfy the jevvs.  Then Egypt has to get their ‚Äòfair share‚Äô and every other non-White shitehole in the world, because democrcy/grift.Burn it all down.  Sooner please.

You can stop right there. Take everything from Leviathan and give it nothing. I want Whites to get every dime possible. I want Whites ON food stamps, on WIC, and demanding MORE Social Security and Medicare, whatever.
The country was stolen from Heritage America, so let it feast on its dying carcass. Bask in its warmth as it burns down.

            @3g4me ‚ÄìI agree with everything you just wrote, but I would add another thing.  Not only do I want whites to get whatever they can, I want to see everything that the ferals get taken away.  Just so they can finally get a taste of what it‚Äôs like when everything you have gets taken away from you and given to someone else.  It still won‚Äôt match the destructive selfishness that they exhibit because we actually WORKED for the money we hand to them, but anything that can be taken away from them is a plus in my book.  Of course, it it were all up to me, I‚Äôd take away a lot more than that from them, but that‚Äôs not an appropriate topic for the respectable intellectuals who post here.

        ‚ÄúNow, Mike Pompeo is a ridiculous person by the standards of normal people, but he is typical of the political class.‚ÄùSo here‚Äôs the question: if Mike Pompeo is ridiculous, can this system, as presently configured, possibly reform itself from within?Mike Pompeo, by any objective standard, at first glance doesn‚Äôt look ridiculous. He grew up in Orange County with normal parents. He graduated first in his class at West Point ‚Äì not easy. Whatever you think of Harvard Law School, he got in and graduated. He worked at Bain (not easy) and got backing in business from the Koch Brothers (yes I know‚Ä¶but still, they back smart people). I have not met him. But his resume suggests he is at least as smart as Joe Biden or AOC.So how is it possible that this guy Pompeo, who on paper should be pretty reliable and one of the best our system can produce for us, ended up espousing such nonsense? It seems pretty clear to me that the MIC Borg just sucks promising guys like him into its maw, offering them money, power, women whatever. Very very few can resist and any that dare face the Trump treatment or worse.It‚Äôs truly going to take Asimov‚Äôs Mule to get us out of this mess, if it‚Äôs even possible. The system just will not produce the man we‚Äôre looking for. They all end up like Pompeo ‚Äì sock puppets with the CIA‚Äôs hand up their giggy.

            I think the window for reform closed in 1992. That window opened in 1982 once it was clear the public supported the system to weather the fixing of the money supply. Washington had about a decade to address the pension systems, health care systems and the political rules. Nothing happened. Once the Clinton circus hit town, the die was cast.

                Why? The GenX cohort is within a gnat‚Äôs whisker of being as big as the Boomer cohort, and getting closer every day (currently 19% to 21%, IIRC) and Millenials and GenZ are already over 40%. That‚Äôs about 60% voting age people who Pompeo could be appealing to, against a measly 21%, plus maybe 5% that are Silents.
No matter where you go on the intarwebs, some generally GenX commentator or commenter is proposing pillows for olds or something similar. If Pompeo is appealing to that demographic, why couldn‚Äôt reform happen? What could stop it?

                Perhaps. But a big part of the Pompeo problem is that the ‚ÄúOverton Window‚Äù has really narrowed dramatically in political discourse since Obama.Can Pompeo campaign on deporting immigrants, stopping wars, ending affirmative action and breaking up banking, tech and health-care cartels? No. The GOP donors hold the exact opposite positions. So we‚Äôre back to the anodyne Pete Peterson/David Stockman budget lectures.Lest we forget, the odious Paul Ryan tried to talk about this Medicare/SS stuff too when he ran. Please recall Joe Biden was able to hold his own in a debate with Ryan on this stuff. Just imagine! I can only assume Pompeo will follow Ryan into the private equity industry or something after getting 1 delegate in the primaries. Nobody will vote for cuts to big programs.

        Speaking of the Bourbons, we desperately need a Napoleon to come out of the woodwork to shatter this place to pieces.  I‚Äôll take anyone at this point.  Pompeo would be one of those generals that he ripped through like crepe paper as he consolidated power.   Pompeo desperately wants to pick up a sandwich but covets raw power even more, his handlers reminding him every 20 minutes that voters are turned off by fat white guys.  Pompeo loves guns and butter.  But when push comes to shove he‚Äôs Raytheon‚Äôs candidate.

        According to the DC bubble, White America is always supposed to care more about (and sacrifice for) freedom and democracy in some s***hole across the ocean rather than their own interests here.  Why should we care more about inflation, a border invasion, massive chemical spills, out of control jogger criminality, cultural rot and non-stop governmental/media lying about all of it when can patriotically stand up for (or beat down) the little guy on the other side of the world?  In the words of Ace Ventura, ‚Äúgee, let me think.‚Äù

            The Help in Congress usually can claim foreign wars and policies are a ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù because what happens is far away and opaque. Afghanistan was an exception because the failure was so spectacular, but most of these cons and adventures are just as screwed up as the DMV  but can be deemed to be a great success because of distance and lack of transparency.The opacity also presents for more bribe opportunities.With a crisis of legitimacy and accelerated looting, the Regime needs to claim some success no matter how farcical and find a way to simultaneously line its pockets. I‚Äôm betting an announcement of a great peace agreement, which looks eerily like the Minsk accords, before the Ukraine fiasco gets dragged into political debates this autumn. Can‚Äôt have the rabble hearing about how the stuff abroad is just as fucked up as domestic operations, you know. Of course, that puts too much faith in Normie but there is at least in theory a breaking point.

                Agree Jack. They will declare victory and move on to the next disaster. The Bradley Fighting Vehicles left on the steppes of Ukraine will join the Hueys dumped off Vietnam, the Baghdad green zone outbuildings and the trucks left in Afghanistan in the boneyard of American failures.

            I can only think of three successes in the last 75 years: Germany, Japan, and Korea.  We were a different country then and willing to go the distance, but mostly we defeated and therefore changed high intellect societies.  Our failure was going into shit-hole, third world countries and expecting to change their populace.  Not gonna happen.

                Not possible.  All the courts, FBI/DOJ and other institutions that turn a blind eye to Democrat fraud would leap into action and jail any Republicans who tried to do this.

            It‚Äôs designed so it comes out the same either way, if your life span is average or close to it. People who live much longer than average win by waiting to 67. People who live much shorter than average win by starting at 62.
I wouldn‚Äôt base the decision on expectations of systemic collapse. As they say, the market can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

            now, for sure.   your time is worth a lot more than the $$ you are leaving on the table.   also, i read that SS is set up so that you get about the same total $$ no matter when you start collecting.  i started collecting at 63, BTW, and have 0 regrets.

                Karl, total SSI varies depending on your life expectancy.  Live longer, collect more.  The tables are changed every so,often, but let‚Äôs say you are expected to live until 84.  If you take early, or delay you might come out about the same‚Äîbut if you delay and live longer you get more in the long run.  Vise versa for taking early.  Any accountant has software that can print out all options and totals collected for both spouses for whatever longevity you feed in.  And of course if you are sickly, then grab the cash‚Äîunless you don‚Äôt need it, then you can delay‚Äîeven should you die‚Äîand your spouse collects the higher check for the remainder of her/his life.It‚Äôs not rocket science, but there are a few variables to juggle.

            The question is not as simple as you state it, nor are the answers you receive here correct‚Äîindeed, they are *incorrect*‚Äîgiven the lack of questions about you and your wife (if married) and your health.For example, if you and your wife are eligible for SSI, you need to plan together‚Äîespecially if there are age differences and income differences.  One reason, when both of you get SSI benefits, and one does, then you have the option of choosing the spouse‚Äôs benefit check if you wish.  However, your spouse does not receive two checks.  Just the larger of the two.  That means your spouse‚Äôs income *will* decline!Now one reason to decline ‚Äúearly‚Äù benefits (not necessarily retirement from employment) is to maximize one spouse‚Äôs benefit, which when that spouse dies will role over to the other.  There are other thoughts with regarding early benefit application‚Äîlike taxation that also need computation and further inquiry as to current finances.

            You don‚Äôt need to tweak Social Security.  It‚Äôs already tweaked, albeit it could be made actuarial sound.  Social Security has its own funding source‚Äîworkers.  By law, if it runs short of funds, it simply reduces payout by that percentage short‚Äîacross the board.  The current estimate is we will all take a haircut of 25% when the Treasury Bonds run out in 2030.  So your monthly check will come out to 75% what it currently is.  Of course, a sharp recession causes the trust fund to run out sooner.  As it is, we already do not take in as much as pay out.Medicare is grossly underfunded, but also has a worker deduction.  Not sure how it can be starved and still function as we‚Äôve known it.  We will inevitably revert to rationing, in fact if not in name, which is what is found in most socialized medicine countries.  For example, we have now found a rise in colon cancer in the younger population, so that preventive/diagnostic colonoscopies are recommended for those 40-50 and up.  In other countries, you don‚Äôt get such diagnostic/preventatives until you have secondary indications, which is quite late in the game.

                Market forces are another form of rationing.It‚Äôs not possible for normal income people to have infinite healthcare.
There hasn‚Äôt been a proportionate increase in colon cancer rates for young people in other OECD countries so maybe less incentive for their healthcare  to repsond similarly?

I read a paper in the British Medical Journal a few years ago ‚Äúdecrying‚Äù the ‚Äúunder resourcing‚Äù for preventive colonoscopies in the NHS (Brit socialized medicine).  They actually pointed to the US as a model for more screening for colon cancer at younger ages.Why did I read such?  5 years any month now (got to look it up) and I am free of colon cancer according to the American Cancer society.

                Grandma is still left to die unfortunately‚Äîit‚Äôs just not as obvious. What good is seeing a doctor 6 weeks out when you are really sick, or worse seeing the AA doctor who must take in Medicare patients to have any patients at all, whereas all the competent Whites have left the system.

                    Interesting about the AA docs.  Noticed that if you want a White or Jewish doctor, many are now charging an annual retainer/premium anywhere from $5k up for the privilege of being their patient.

        And yet, the average Joe is still wedded to the belief that voting matters, and most importantly, that voting is easy to do versus anything hard that might actually make a difference and require getting the fat ass up off the couch. A recent DoD study concluded that 75% of American youth are unfit for military service. Most couldn‚Äôt change a tire if their life depended on it. Yes, DC is a cesspool of dysfunction, corruption, and malevolence;  but the base stock is also declining at an alarming rate. We now have businesses like Door Dash that bring food to your house because the fat asses won‚Äôt even go to Walmart, ride around on the fat-ass electric cart mobile, and do their own shopping. We desperately need a collapse to change this environment and force people off the couch. No messiah is going to fix an addiction to fat &amp; lazy; only a hard bottom does that.

            The thing about Door Dash and other voluntary expenditures is the frivolousness of it.  If one takes a look at what we piss our money away on, no wonder we are broke when we retire and become wards of the State.
When I was at the University, students were complaining about costs (as they should be), but this was followed up in one article with an analysis of just what those ‚Äúexpenses‚Äù were.  One repeated expense was the $5 daily latte‚Äôs from Starbucks.   üôÅ

                        Freshly ground coffee beans have better flavor because the internal oils are preserved by the bean husk and only exposed by the grinding process. These internal oils will evaporate and oxidize to some extent in pre-ground coffee and this degrades the flavor via the loss of these natural oils. Large coffee vendors offset this deficit by admixing palm (or other non-natural oils) into their pre-ground base supply in an attempt to recreate a faux-flavor and allowing them to charge extra.

                    This is where having a malfunctional news media is an issue.  No one, especially the general public, can be expected to be informed on all questions and if pertinent information is systematically hidden from the public eye, the fitness test changes.  Protecting basic health and safety in a crumbling society by developing a means of reliable information flow outside corrupt institutions will be key.  Our people have silos of knowledge that don‚Äôt communicate with one another.

            Great point Jack, but I think it‚Äôs more of an Oligarchy rather than an Autocracy. I would welcome an autocracy. At least someone might be held responsible for this sh*tshow. As it is, there‚Äôs nobody obviously in charge.

                Yeah, I‚Äôll go oligarchy with autocratic features. It‚Äôs always been an oligarchy but the totalitarian aspect is relatively new. Even the illusion of democracy has been cut out.

                IMO, it‚Äôs a rather vast Power Structure comprised of FedGov, Big Media, Hollywood, Wall Street/Silicon Valley and academia. They all work in concert to transfigure the perverse and diverse, to subjugate whitey, and to enrich themselves at our expense.

        The question is what happens to Trump voters when Trump is gone? They‚Äôve been half red-pilled. They know something is wrong with the system and with the GOP, but they don‚Äôt know where to go or do other than vote for Trump.The establishment is annoyed by Trump voters but is hoping that they fade away after Trump. It may be right. Trump is too vain to build a larger movement and political faction. He wants all of the spotlight.Not that it matters much. Demographics will make all voting irrelevant in the presidential race soon enough. Well, voting in the Democratic primary might matter, but the establishment will control that outcome as well just as they made sure Biden won.

            Citizen:  My impression of today‚Äôs devoted Trump voters is that they remain race-blind civic nationalists, so I would hardly call them half red-pilled.  Despite deploring ‚Äòthe swamp,‚Äô they still revere the constitution and remain convinced that everything will work out fine if they can just vote the right people into office.I scan the headlines at Gayway pundit and they encapsulate how these people think.  They are thrilled by every non-White success story and angrily retort to an L3 (loony leftist lady) who opposes Whites adopting feather Indians ‚Äì not because of her faux outrage at ‚Äògenocide‚Äô ‚Äì but because genetics couldn‚Äôt possibly control anyone‚Äôs outcome or personality and cross-racial adoption is an unalloyed Christian good.The majority of Trump voters, like the CPAC attendees, are hopeless.  Lost causes.

                Yeah. Certainly, older Trump voters are hopeless colorblind CivNats. They‚Äôll take that to the grave.
They don‚Äôt like the anti-white agenda, but they don‚Äôt like it because they feel that any identity politics is wrong. Being colorblind is a part of their self-identity. They won‚Äôt let that go.

                    I started checking out FreeRepublic in 2016, I was interested in Trump‚Äôs candidacy and no other site was anything but never Trump. So, I went there a lot over the years. It was always civnat as could be but sometimes it went over the top. But when Ukraine started it got overrun but bots and paid shills boosting Ukraine 24/7. You could tell it was a fake because they posted and answered each other never deviating from the party line and they would use the same cliches to attack the people trying to get balance and see both sides. Those posters would never post on a non-Ukraine thread but would have sometimes 20 or more replys in a Ukraine thread.I finally got sick of it and signed up and was accepted as a member. But my object was to sign up and see how long before I got banned.My first reply was in a threat that had attracted several of the pro-Ukraine nuts. I told the poster that I needed a job and would be willing to work as a Ukraine paid bot. I could have done a fantastic job although from what I could see they had to work really long hours or in shifts to post like they were doing.Well, I had the absolute shortest posing career at any website ever. My first post got me banned and never showed up in the thread. I have a sneakin suspicion that FR is a compromised site charged with keeping the civnats from taking that short step over to our side.

Once in a while I‚Äôd simply comment ‚ÄúPure Ukrainian propaganda‚Äù and delete recommendation for further viewing.  These channels were all similar.  Computer voicing of Ukrainian victories of troglodyte Russians and video that had nothing to do with the info posted.  Always a few thousand subscriber and a few hundred views.  Comment were all ‚ÄúSlava Ukraini‚Äù mindless mantra.

                My brother still believes that Trump is our savior.
While he acknowledges my observations about the world, tribalism and race realism, he still believes in his gut that a good economy will solve all problems.
All we really need is a meritocracy and to slash some regulations on business.  Problem solved.  Prosperity solves everything.

        Did anyone mention that Nimarata Randhawa is  BOTH a Wyman AND an Indian? (Dot, not feather)I feel this is really important to ‚Äúown the libs‚Äù, and should be brought up as much as possible, especially from the candidate‚Äôs own lips.It‚Äôs both stunning and brave.(Someone should ask her if the British were right to use imperial colonialism to stop the India culture imperative of ‚Äúsati‚Äù, or if it was an example of arrogant western imposition of western values?  Is the west doing more of the same with good think by exporting and imposing homosexuality, pederasty, and transgenderism?  That would be fun.)

        I didn‚Äôt read far enough and just came to this howler:He predicts that the Supreme Court will rule against the Biden administration. Even then, Pompeo said, the loan amnesty sets another dangerous precedent where the government coddles citizens promising that the state ‚Äúcan save you from yourself.‚ÄùYes, millions of 18 year olds all decided to take out massive student loans for college in the last 40 years against the advice of the government, their high schools, and every other leadership entity of society.  The especially didn‚Äôt encourage kids who were totally unfit to complete college level work to attend loans.  It amazes me who few Republicans have called for punishing the colleges, which are universally run by people who hate them.

                True. But much of this is because IQ and similar tests are outlawed because some groups are notoriously stupid, er I mean plagued by test bias and institutional racism.
So now young people need pricey degrees to prove they‚Äôre smart and capable.  But of course college has been dumbed down accordingly even as tuition has skyrocketed.  The whole system needs to be destroyed and rebuilt from the ground up.

                Which came first, chicken or egg?Employers demand degrees‚Äîeven when the job does not require anything taught past HS level‚Äîbecause it is a proxy of sorts.  The degree signifies an ability to get up daily and sit through any number of mind numbingly boring courses for 5+ years in exchange for a meaningless piece of paper.  In short, you‚Äôve shown you are the perfect factory drone.In ‚ÄúThe Case Against Education‚Äù, Caplin outlines this phenomena in detail.  He does admit however, there may be a bit of increase with an advanced degree in numerical ability and literacy‚Äîif those courses are taken.

                        We forget how much education at all levels has been dumbed down and gutted of its cultural and technical expertise.  Starting largely with the Dewey revolution, our children have been taught more and more poorly and the emphasis has shifted to cultural destruction rather than cultural support.  A PhD in this era means nothing compared to what it meant before, and even fairly fluffy degrees like English literature demanded a level of scholarship and erudition absent today.Consider the modern PhD candidate and compare to even a modestly intelligent undergraduate of a hundred years ago.

When I was applying, there was no such thing.  If you needed remedial classes, you were told to go to Community College and reapply next year.  Of course, I applied and enrolled to university in another country, you may remember it‚Äî 90% White America.

            Those loans are never going to be paid back.Team R repeatedly steps on it‚Äôs own wee-wee by conflating a contractual obligation (loan) with a moral imperative.  It‚Äôs not; it‚Äôs just a contract that went south for the lender and the lendee.Don‚Äôt pay a car loan?  Fine, the collateral is your car.  Don‚Äôt pay a house mortgage?  Your collateral is your property.Making education an unsecured loan non-dischargeable in bankruptcy was a colossal mistake, and literally did create a class of debt slaves.  Team R did this under Bush.  They really, really f‚Äôd it all up.Not discussed are the changes the Biden Administration is doing some rule changes to make student loan debt dischargeable under bankruptcy at least possible (with penalties).Needs to be done.

                The issue is taxpayers subsidizing the loss. The cost must fall on the parties to the contract. I think the borrower gets a credit hit, the loan originators take a haircut and the college pays the difference out of its endowment.
The latter is the most important. Make them pay the price. That will also make the donors and Wall St. (who manage the endowments), pay a part of the price.
It won‚Äôt happen, but it should.

                        There is a complication to all of this. Those institutions protect cultural heritage.  We are going to have to figure out a way around this problem. Protection of our lives and survival is most important, of course, but cultural survival is more important than people sometime realize.  Conquerors typically destroy as much of a culture as they can, even if some of the people are kept alive.  We are a sharp contrast to this (note our tendency to preserve the cultural output of those we have displaced or conquered) but we cannot expect loving preservation of the output of our ancestors by those who already show zeal in its destruction.

Once one begins thinking about and examining the income and assets of a typical American university it becomes abundantly clear how each on is able to support such enormous hives of Marxists.

        From the RPC article:Pompeo has already warned his own family not to rely on the federal government for their retirement. ‚ÄúWhen I talk to my son,‚Äù he said of the way things stand now, ‚ÄúI tell him, ‚ÄòMake sure you have a good job because Social Security is not going to be there for you.‚Äô‚ÄùHow do they see this playing out?  People pay into Social Security for 40-45 years and get half or less of what they were promised and everyone just accepts it?  Maybe they think if they kill enough people during the civil unrest that follows the system becomes solvent again.  Maybe release another virus to kill off more old people too.  No one is ever going to accept a lockdown again.  Maybe they don‚Äôt even have a plan.  Given their widespread incompetence in everything else, that might be the most likely answer.

            ‚ÄúNo one is ever going to accept a lockdown again.‚Äù Au contraire. You have way too much faith in your fellow humans. People scare quite easily. The government and media can use fear to coax a majority into accepting nearly anything. Plus, the precedent of quarantining the well has already been established. Therefore, it should be even easier to pull off next time around. The fact that the system called them ‚Äúlockdowns‚Äù ‚Äî a prison term ‚Äî and got away with it is all you need to know about the pliability of the dipshit public.But take people‚Äôs Social Security away? That might well cause a revolt.

        Regarding social security, it‚Äôs probably safe‚Ä¶until Boomers are gone.  As a member of Gen-X, I fully expect to be screwed when it‚Äôs my turn to collect. Regardless, I‚Äôll still consider it a kick in the teeth, considering we‚Äôve got plenty of money for foreign invaders and neocon wars, not to mention gibs for people who contribute nothing but crime, squalor, and more replicas of themselves.

            Karl Denniger has run the math on that a couple times and actually once the boomers are gone the math on Social Security starts to kinda-sorta work again.  That doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt get gutted because at the point the main beneficiaries will be old, underpowered Whites.  Medicare has it‚Äôs own host of issues but you can note the theme:-SS: Has own tax base, mostly benefits Whites.  Always mentioned for cuts.-Medicare: Has it‚Äôs own tax base, mostly benefits Whites and BigMed corps.  Often mentioned for cuts.-Medicaid: A budget disaster with no revenue stream, mostly benefits non-Whites and BigMed; never mentioned for cuts.

            As a fellow Xer I suspect what will happen is the age to receive ‚ÄúFull Benefits‚Äù will be raised to 70 or 72, and eventually to 75.
M‚ÄôLady is a bit older than me and recently got her SS Statement. For now, her age for receiving full benefits is 67. I suspect within a few years our cohort will be looking at a ‚Äúneeded adjustment‚Äù to 70.

        I‚Äôm calling it right now: 2024 is the year we start to see the Fortification for Democracy start running in the Republicans‚Äô favor.The ‚Äútwo party system‚Äù will never die, since everyone in Washington is very good friends and the grift is just too good to give up (think of all the consultants and rent seekers and whatnot that would be put out of work if the Republican Party officially went away). So they have to maintain the kabuki that elections matter, since after all there are only so many Persian billionaires to underwrite ‚Äúconservative‚Äù grifting operations like the Bulwark. Which means Tim Scott or Vindaloo Vicky or whatever nonentity they put up is going to have to be made to seem like a viable contender ‚Äî especially after they rig their primaries to keep Trump out.Ergo, Fortification. Turns out ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù really did win with some  huge percentage of the vote, because most of the usual Republican voters simply stayed home. Can‚Äôt be having that ‚Äî for continuance-of-the-grift reasons ‚Äî so Al Franken‚Äôs car and its trunk of ballots will be making stops in red districts next year.

                    Severian: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you wish John Blutarsky really WAS a Senator?‚Äù
Weird.
Just yesterday, I was thinking about the epic 1978 John Vernon* rant, ‚ÄúFat, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through life, son,‚Äù and it dawned on me how much more intelligent a Bluto Blutarsky was than a braindead John Fetterman or a braindead Tater Joe Paedophile O‚ÄôBiden.
============
*In 1976, John Vernon had played the role of ‚ÄúFletcher‚Äù in The Outlaw Josey Wales.
Those are two of the greatest supporting actor roles in the entire history of cinema.
According to Wikipedia, Vernon was Armenian.
Go figure.

            It‚Äôs too important that Republicans be seen to lose again in ‚Äô24, preferably again via blatant cheat. Their voters have to be humiliated without relief. Democracy must *mean* that normal people have no say and get nothing, ever. Elections must *mean* the humiliation of disobedient citizens. Young Democrats have this understanding. The average man doesn‚Äôt yet. His prior conditioning is too strong.
