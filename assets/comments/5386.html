        The knock on democracy wasn’t stupid voters. That’s a modern complaint. The traditional critique was that the public was prone to make irrational decisions because large groups don’t think. They feel.

            No doubt. The American system was originally intended to put a brake on public passions, while still giving the people a say in the affairs of state. The conservative critique of democracy is that it always leads to despotism.

            Worth noting that when I did some teaching, the ‘students’ had not the slightest interest in anything other than their own narrow interests. I would tell them they had a wealth of information at their fingertips, but they would rather listen to foul-language rap and play ‘whack-a-donkey’ all day. It seemed that the more you gave these people the less they wanted, or rather merely wanted more of what they already had.
As for immigration, from my experience our new friends were just as gullible as the natives when it came to shit-through-a-wire.

                This is something I’ve discovered as well. The narrowness of young people is a bit off-putting at first blush. Instead of the wide-eyed gaz trying to take in too much, it is the narrow brow of those taking in too little. This is a consequence that will have bad ends, I suspect, when these people are in the middle years when narrowness comes easy.

            Agreed, but even factoring in race, our young people are stupid. Spend time on an Ivy League campus and it is shocking.

        Facebook is yet more confirmation that Marshall McLuhan was right.  I’m sure I’m the zillionth guy to make this observation, but when it comes to social media, the medium really IS the message.  Now, instead of a million atomized, personality-less individuals being instructed by television, those personality-less atoms can chant banalities at each other and feel less alone.And don’t get me started on Wikipedia making you dumber.  I like to compare the Republicans destroying themselves in 2015 to the Whigs destroying themselves after 1852… and oh, the Wiki-inspired pedantry I get.  Wikipedia’s motto should be “helping miseducated retards miss the point since 2001.”

        “we are floating in a sea of bad information”Isn’t that the truth? For my part, I do not watch TV, go to movies, or participate in any social media. But I do read blogs like this one every day. Does that mean I inhabit my own echo chamber?I very occasionally visit a left wing site via a link; I am appalled by reading a dozen comments and realizing how much these people hate me.“We are floating in a sea of bad information”. This will certainly not end well. But many thanks, Z for the aphorisms; they condense a lot of observation and analysis down into something I can grasp with immediacy (guess that’s what an aphorism does).

        Cable TV has 400+ channels, but if you start looking at who owns what, that list shrinks to about 20 different corporations, tops. Most of all the cable channels are actually owned by the broadcast nets.What’s sad about news-on-twitter is that the @BreakingNews twitter account has close to 8 million followers, but when you dig deep and track down the owner, surprise surprise, its an NBC property.That all being said, I’m of the opinion that no one is actually on twitter. Twitter seems to be journalists talking to each other, political junkies talking to each other, marketers trying to push their products, and Hollywood celebrities pushing themselves. (And I realize most of those categories overlap.) Twitter gets pushed because the media is on it, not because normal people are.But I digress…

            I’m of the same mind. Twitter is about the pose with the chattering classes and those who wish to be in the chattering classes. I follow Jonah Goldberg, for example, and his tweets are mostly banal musings about his dog or how he is struggling with the twinkie wrapper. The comments are mostly his fans cheering him in some way. It’s a weird form of church.

                the irony(?) of twitter is that while it allows a “mass audience” it also allows a handful of trolls to bug the hell out of supposedly respected journalists like Goldberg. #NROrevolt

        I know what you mean. I posted something on my Twit account, which periodically I look at, about whether the Syrian refugees would want to come to Europe given the white man’s supposed track record of hate, racism and misogyny. It is something i occasionally air in the family (using, shock horror, ordinary words) but one of my close relatives — who is well aware of my views as it happens — immediately called my wife to ask if she had seen my tweet. So my wife asked, I showed and she saw it contained no hate, racism or even misogyny. In this I am pretty careful what  I do say and no one was called names or even hated. It was an open question, though as I admit I did know the answer it was more rhetorical.Well, things were pretty frosty at home for a couple of hours after that, but I survived. Lesson learned: I had forgotten this close relative has a twitter account she almost never visits. So I guess in the social media whirl I just got a bit unlucky that this just happened to be the time (after three years away) she decided to click in and check on me.As for fecesbook, it really isn’t anything useful although it does let me see how my left-leaning relatives get to spout off about things they know little about. I have several times poised with my finger over the send button with a withering reply to some socialist gobbledegook just itching to go, but hit delete instead.It’s wise. I can only take so much frost in my life.

            Hehe, “fecesbook”. Good one, UKer! I joined Facebook years ago to reconnect with old high school and college friends, but quickly understood what a stupid waste of time it is. I now use it as you do, a means of spying on Leftist friends and family while they bloviate publicly. I never say a thing unless someone spouts off nonsense about Islam. I let an awful lot of other nonsense go by, but I will not, can not  allow ignorance of Islam to go unchallenged. For this, I am willing to endure endless frost.

                Like you Kathleen, I joined Facebook for a utilitarian reason. I signed up about year ago because it was the only way you could register to comment on the web page of one of our local TV stations. When I looked at my Facebook home page, all six of my kids (ranging in age from 47-59) wanted to be friends. How they knew I’d joined Facebook, or how Facebook knew they were my kids I’ll never know. I went ahead and made them my Facebook friends. A couple days later I looked at my Facebook home page and was stunned by the drivel my middle-aged kids, as well as several of their kids and friends, who had apparently become my friends too, were spouting. I’ve never looked at it again.
