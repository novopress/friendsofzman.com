        I don’t think the webpage is a hoax, because it is so tepid. The “I’m going to kill all blacks” stuff was a hoax though, tweeted by a young black guy. I’m still waiting to find out about that Muslim in Florida whose house was shot at.

        Anyone wonder how all of a sudden, the Black Live Matter Nazis are all over the place and very active on college campuses?Anyone wonder how there is are many demonstrations by SEIU funded and led “workers” to raise the minimum wage for everyone to $15/hourDo NOT think for a moment Obama does not have a claw in all of this. He has somehow communicated to his black Nazi storm troopers – the Black Lives Matter Sturm Abteilung – the BLMSA –  to raise hell and go on their book burning, hate whitey campaigns.It is no coincidence this is occurring within site of the next presidential election.You can bet your house that there will be MASSIVE AND VIOLENT demonstrations at the republican convention by the  Black Kill Whitey Matters Nazis all funded by pals of Obama.This will make 1968 look like a cake walk.Of course, the upside is that most Americans will look at all the Black Hitlers tossing bombs and NOT vote for the commies Sanders or Hillary.

        Mark Twain’s advice for raising teenagers:“When a child turns 12, he should be kept in a barrel and fed through the bung hole, until he reaches 16…at which time you plug the bung hole.”“Why do children want to grow up? Because they experience their lives as constrained by immaturity and perceive adulthood as a condition of greater freedom and opportunity. But what is there today, in America, that very poor and very rich adolescents want to do but cannot do? Not much: they can “do” drugs, “have” sex, “make” babies, and “get” money (from their parents, crime, or the State). For such adolescents, adulthood becomes synonymous with responsibility rather than liberty. Is it any surprise that they remain adolescents?”~Thomas Szasz

        Yes, we have Backlash here in the UK too. Following the deaths of 130 (and probably more as the badly injured don’t make it) in Paris, the local BBC news channel was quick to tell us that a muslim woman in a supermarket was approached by another  female who nudged her arm and said she was “a terrorist” and another, surprisingly unbearded muslim male told the camera that people had made unkind comments about his friends which hurt his feelings.So out of a region of some seven or eight million people, two muslims had been slightly offended. Not killed, not wounded, not physically damaged but who had their feelings cut slightly. Fortunately, being the BBC with its dhimmi ways, a representative of a muslim snitch-and-complain body was wheeled out to tell us that they were ready and willing to rush to the aid of muslims suffering so terribly.

        Seems like the entire concept of sending a bunch of nineteen year olds to live together and learn some things has seriously jumped the shark.  Maybe it is time to just lock each one in a separate room, slide food, an I-pad, and an X-Box under the door, and be done with it.  Demonstrated good behavior means one can come out of the room for an hour a day and mingle with others, go to the animal shelter and pet the dogs and cats, or hit the nearest Starbucks.
