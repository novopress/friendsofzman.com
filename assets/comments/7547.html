        Cultural marxism is like Schrodingers Cat: a bunch of useless idiots trying to bullshit the rest of us with an assumption of some fucking irrelevant retarded alternative reality. Give you a great example. If one cultural marxist sneaked on board a space ship of only white dirt people flying to the planet Mar’s, people who chose to move to an entirely uninhabited planet, to fundamentally transform this new world into a prosperous and happy culture based on the ideals of primal rights of men and liberty, free unfettered economic enterprise, to live in a world without cultural marxism, it would not be long before that one cultural marxist would be inviting hordes of non whites who would upon landing stick out their greasy meathooks demanding free shit, having tantrums if they did not have everything handed to them on a silver platter, and using reverse racism disguised as a lie called “white privilege” to create a false narrative white privilege makes them slaves, and their dear leader would be telling his sycophants white racist extremists didn’t make that Mar’s a great place to live and how us dirt people are racist because we are white.

        I used to love cruising by the Costco in my college town (for non-Americans, Costco is a “warehouse” store where you get good discounts on items because you buy in bulk).  Watching ardent feminists try — and fail — to heft 50 lb bags of kitty litter off the shelf was the height of comedy.  To really rub it in, I’d often go over and ask something like “is this a good brand?” while picking the bag up one-handed.  Good times.

        (1) When Rhonda Rousey was getting all the publicity before what turned out to be an nationally televised ass kicking, MSNBC commentators, and others on the Left, were bemoaning that  it was “unfair” that she was “not allowed” to fight in the men’s division.  To her credit, Rousey immediately came out and said that under no circumstances was she getting into a ring with a UFC fighter.
(2) Under Obama’s reading of Title IX, it is illegal to bar trans boys or men form women’s athletic teams.  Goodbye, and for the most part, good riddance to those awful teams.

            Obummer took special interest in Title IX because he can’t compete in real men’s sports.  He “feels” more comfortable with the fairer sex level of challenge.  He even rides sissy bikes.  Interesting no one ever mentions his golf game, even though it is more “gender” neutral.  All those tax dollars spent on the golf courses of the world and we don’t even get a report of an “x” stroke improvement since taking office.  Just what is his golf handicap?  We know about all the others, he he.  Real guys have goals and look to constantly improve.  Him, not so much.

        Women’s tennis is better to watch than men’s  (Again – speed factor is slowed by about 20%.)  And I have to admit liking women’s softball…….all the action plays out on a more compact diamond.  In contrast to baseball (and the other sports mentioned) it’s quicker than the men’s version.  Every ball put in play is bang-bang.  And they are fundamentally sound.  At the high-college level (e.g. PAC-10) they rarely make mental mistakes.  Compare to a certain Mr Yasiel Puig  (baseball fans will get the reference).  The ultimate million-dollar talent with the 10 cent brain.There……my sop to the ladies.   Now where was I again?  Ohh yes……..  The suspension of reality that is the female firefighter………………….

            Agree 100%. Re tennis, it’s one of those instances where the reduced speed actually enhances the game. Men’s tennis, in my view, is mostly a matter of creating an immediate imbalance via an incredibly powerful serve. The play tends to be less interesting because of it; blistering serve followed by desperate return followed by kill shot. With women, the serves are far weaker and thus more manageable, so it leads to many more long and interesting rallies. And then you have all the sexy grunts. No comparison.

        Funny you mention women’s soccer. It’s actually the only watchable women’s sport. It’s like watching men’s soccer except everything is slowed down by 20%. I gather this annoys hard-core men’s soccer fanatics, but to the casual observer it’s harder to spot the difference, and the game becomes somewhat interesting on its own terms. I’m sure the size of the field, and lack of markings on it, helps blur the difference by providing a poor frame of reference. This is unlike women’s basketball, where the lack of athleticism, quickness, and jumping ability is so glaringly obvious it simply can’t be ignored.

            I’ll watch girls soccer in the big events. Yeah, it’s slow and the pitch should be smaller to make it more interesting, but it is still watchable. Girl’s hockey is similar. Girls basketball is brutal.

                There is no body-checking allowed in girls hockey, even at the highest (i.e. Olympic) levels. That makes a big difference to allowing the pace of the game to be relatively high.  No body-checking = no consequences (feminism in a nutshell?) = a fast game.  If they played with full contact, the gap between the men and women’s game would likely be closer to what you see with your NBA / WNBA comparison.

            During the last Olympics, I watched the prerecorded men’s and women’s figure skating competitions back to back. Figure skating is a sport that makes good use of the stuff women are good at: costumes, flexibility, dance skills, etc. The men’s jumps and spins were all obviously higher, faster, longer and more powerful. Put back to back, the difference was striking.

            Women’s volleyball (indoor) is good to watch. The size of the court means the sport is less reliant on speed and the players are not physical with each other.

        Even knowledgeable baseball sites like Fangraphs post the occasional lunatic gender equality piece. They can’t seem to help themselves. Plenty of commenters are ready to approve, and bemoan the lack of opportunity for broads in baseball. Then some guy, maybe me, will shoot down all their theories and once the gate is opened the reality based crowd pours in. Reality based people tend to avoid the egalitarian lunatic crowd as unclean (and sabermetrics is supposed to be entirely reality based!) Thing is, girls who play sports themselves are very rarely unrealistic about what playing with men entails.  I’ve not known one that is. Other than the talent factor, the very reason that girls are not present but in tiny numbers in things that they are not qualified for is that they are in fact much more realistic than men. Men are far more prone to reaching for rings that they will never grasp, and to their permanent detriment.

        Also, do we notice that the strongest womens soccer teams are from “girls can do anything” countries? USA, Canada, Norway, China, Sweden, Japan, Australia, Germany. Many mens soccer powers like Italy, Spain, France, Argentina, Croatia, Portugal, Netherlands aren’t that strong in the ladies version. England are awful in both.

        The AFL (Australian Football League, Australian Rules) is cobbling together a national women’s league to begin in the not too distant future. The media is doing its best to pump it up and make it sound like the public is very keen. I’m scratching my head. Australians don’t have another three hours in their weekend to commit to a level of football which would get torn apart by Div III Amateur men’s teams. Nor are there enough quality players to put the teams together. Then when it gets going, wait until we see women getting carried off concussed or with broken legs. The audience and sponsors will flee. I’m all in favour of women enjoying their recreation time as they see fit but this league will finish in reality land.

            There was a study by the government using military people:https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/002635968in that report: “The average female Army recruit is 4.8 inches shorter, 31.7 pounds lighter, has 37.4 fewer pounds of muscle, and 5.7 more pounds of fat than the average male recruit. She has only 55 percent of the upper-body strength and 72 percent of the lower-body strength… An Army study of 124 men and 186 women done in 1988 found that women are more than twice as likely to suffer leg injuries and nearly five times as likely to suffer [stress] fractures as men. Women’s aerobic capacity is significantly lower, meaning they cannot carry as much as far as fast as men, and they are more susceptible to fatigue. In terms of physical capability, the upper five percent of women are at the level of the male median. The average 20-to-30 year-old woman has the same aerobic capacity as a 50 year-old man.”

                It’s actually worse than the stats make it out to be. The overall picture forgets that these women take up spaces that a more competent man would and force their male companions to make up that difference as well further degrading the performance of the unit.

        I always tell women I care about about Ted Bundy.   Worst case estimates run as high as 100 victims.  One was able to disengage and save her life. He was no great physical specimen.

        My son — a football (soccer) fan like me — maintains that football’s governing bodies don’t like National teams playing club sides as the club teams are so much better. The whole carefully engineered and media-promoted fabric of mystique surrounding National footy would be stripped away when even modest club teams can turn over National teams. Still, losing to the under-15s is a blow to the ladies, I have no doubt. Fortunately the Olympics requires an even lower standard so the Oz team should be okay.

            I think your son is probably right. The national teams are assembled for reasons that go beyond winning. They don’t play a lot together so the talent multiplier is not there. The same thing happens in hockey and basketball. In the old days, the US hockey team would play NHL teams to prepare for the Olympics. This was when we used college boys for the Olympics. The results were not pretty for the college boys.
As far as girl’s soccer, there are only a handful of competent teams so the Aussies will be fine.
