        I really ought to know better by now, but could not resist a dig at a co-worker waffling on about how ‘Biden was going to undo all the ills Trump caused’. I played dumb, asking what the result of the election was, she looks at me, dumbfounded:Dude, how can you not know that?! It is the most important election in the history of the US!Me:So, who won… apparently?Her:Biden!Me:That’s the creep who grooms under age girls, isn’t it?I must say, partisanship is most amenable to my character. I don’t even need to think now that the battle lines have been drawn more solidly – just make a slur and hurl it. On a more serious note, this lady has swallowed everything the MSM has said, she cannot be salvaged, it was really a foolish move by me.We’re all fanatics now.

            Yeah this is true I do actually understand how the leftist felt four years ago now because I am totally over people in my own family.  Mostly, because my state does not have a mask a mandate so I don’t have to walk around the park with a mask on. I’m making sure all my Lefty family members know that Biden wants Nationwide mask mandate because that is actually something we will all feel

                Hammer them with the fact mask waste is piling up in the environment and the fibers are piling up in our lungs:

Start screaming about, “murdering Gaia,” when they try to push back on the environmental angle.

                    Ah, hammering them, yes. But with sarcasm, a heavy variety.Just had this exchange with a family member living in a retirement community (word for word):Arc: Hey, congrats!Person: For what?Arc: Your man Biden. I saw on tee vee that he received the largest vote count of any presidential candidate in American history! I am bleeding red, white and blue right now. I could not be more proud.Person: I am going to [conduct typical retirement community activity] with my Biden fan friends right now. You know Doctor [other person] and his son. His son is 48 (non sequitur ignored).Arc: Oh, that’s great. Can you congratulate Doctor [other person) for me?Person: Sure, he said the other day that Trump was documented as lying 22,000 times.Arc: Wow, at least its a round number (no response). Hey, also tell him that since you both live in a retirement community, what is that you call it, “God’s waiting room”, there’s even more to be proud of as an American. Since you guys are one foot in the grave, just think when you get both feet there you can still have voted for Biden as he got the largest percentage of dead people voting for him. Ever!Person: (slight chuckle).Arc: I mean it, I am literally bleeding red, white and blue right now. I am so proud to be an American. You know your man Biden also got the most votes ever in the 100 to 110 year old category. I am so proud.Person: Hey, I’ve seen a lot of bad presidents come and go (see that – already milked an admission that his man is “bad”) … followed by blah-blah and “I have to run, I am going to meet Doctor (other person) and his son at (typical retirement community activity).Arc: Okay, bye. Click.

                    What’s the old saw, “Act in haste; repent in leisure.” IIRC, Talib was one of the ones demanding the headlong rush towards lockdown and face diapers. And to think that he did so based upon his own “precautionary principle”. Reckon he’d admit that maybe the “cure” was worse than the “disease”? Nah. Me neither. Funny how guys like him can argue bothagainstthings they don’t like andforthings they do using the selfsame“scientific”principles. I reckon it’d kill someone like Talib to actually do a rigorous, fact-based analysis.

                And one of them is actually going to feel tangible harm. I’ve been giving one of my leftist relatives money since this all started. We’re in the same business but they’re much less competent than I am so their business has suffered a lot. If there’s another lockdown that’s it they don’t get another dime from me

                    I should compliment you on your charity but my gut response is ARE YOU NUTS?  All you get from charity (verbal or financial) is a kick in the teeth.

Or take France; most French feel a spiritual brotherhood to America due to muh republic and all that, but liberating them from Les Boches didn’t help the fraternal relations.

                                    My experience with Europeans is something to the effect of, “Okay. You helped us free ourselves in 1944-45; but what have you done for ussincethen?”
The Germans are worse since they are the ones who we beat to set the rest of Europe free. If we hadn’t intervened all of Europe (and much of Russia?) would be speaking German now.

                                Whoa there, I almost forgot my favorite Marshall Plan-anecdote.I once had the privilege and pleasure of interviewing one of the first Commie infiltrators to penetrate to permanent secretary-level of Danish government, the legendary Erik Ib Schmidt. (Or erik ib schmidt, as he preferred himself, having adopted a 1920s Commie affectation of not using capital letters. )He had been on the Danish legation at the Marshall Plan negotiations and told me this story:At one summit meeting, they were going to decide how big a slice of the Marshall pie each country would get. To that end, each country had brought this newfangled thing, an “economist”, which nobody really knew what to do with, so they told them to “calculate” the GDP of each Marshall Plan country.So there they were, locked in a conference room, staring at each other with no idea of what to do or where to begin, until one clever guy suggested this: Each representative would write down his estimate of each country’s GDP, they’d strike the highest and the lowest estimate and take the average of the rest.And then, they would sit ten hours and twiddle their thumbs to make it look like they had “calculated” each GDP.A poignant anecdote about both economics and the work ethic of civil servants, if I may say so myself.

                    I’m in a similar position. My older sister is in her late 50s, and has not had a job in about 20 years. She has health problems she uses as an excuse, but could work somewhere like Walgreens. But she is one of those people that just can’t seem to get or hold a job. She is very leftish and convinced my parents to vote Biden. Thankfully we are in a red state so it made no difference, but it still rankles.My parents give her about $2K/mo from their pensions. They don’t need the money and don’t want to feel guilty, so they are purchasing peace. But when they are gone she is going to need help. I always figured I would give her their inheritance of about $200K, since I don’t need it. But she will run out of money well before she dies. I figured I would help her out from a Christian charity perspective. But it is very tempting for me to tell her I am so glad Biden won because now I don’t have to worry about her in the future, knowing the government will be there for her.

                        Make her comp contingent on weekly meetings with a mental health counselor that you thoroughly vet in advance. You owe it to her to try and I believe it might help. Involve your parents and form a family support group.Mental illness is sometimes fixable, and you should try, as it’s comparable to physical damage, even schizo manifestations.I should have done this for myself at one juncture but I’ve always managed to push through things, sometimes extraordinary physical or mental conditions, and emerge on the other side in good shape with additional wisdom. So I’ve never availed myself of mental health assistance but in return it cost me a few years of my mind racing and having to figure out quietly how to realign.Others cannot do this themselves and they are not to blame, genetics contributes tremendously. I have personally and also professionally witnessed people I knew right the ship and get on with meaningful lives, with and without drugs.After 20 years, there is scant chance she’ll improve on her own. Those tape recorders in her brain will just continue their loop until somebody helps her by inserting [music of her choice].Good luck.

                        I know tons of people like her.  Living on a small allowance from one’s parents while being a Leftist freak is probably the most common “job” here in Portland.  It’s people like this who should be given the option to redeem themselves by selling themselves into slavery.  Only half kidding.  Needless to say voting rights go away for good.
As for the grandkids and not wanting to spoil them, why not give them a low interest loan to start a small business?  We’re going to need to replace the hundreds of thousands of them destroyed by the Scamdemic.

                        Yep, the blob got blindsided in 2016, figuring no way Trump could possibly win.  Thus four frantic years of continuous undermining and sand in the gears of the administration.  Now the blob is fully awake and on high alert.  No way another Trumpenstein (in leftard’s view) can possibly win a future  election.  Thus they float their two most pathetic candidates to the (apparent) win, basically saying WTF are you/we gonna do about it?  They didn’t even bother to run someone who could be plausibly thought of as a winner.  They don’t give a shit cause the fix was in – as usual.  Hopefully many more are seeing this clusterf*** for what it is and what it always will be until the black flags are finally hoisted.

Indeed. I believe that I have voted for the last time. Even if I do live to the next general election (thereby out-living my Mom) I see no reason toe believe my vote will even be counted – much less count. I see no reason to engage in an exercise in futility. The Left is united and has the bit between its teeth; there is pretty much nothing beyond the Progs’ grasp now.

                Communists never own anything. All bad is from public enemies. Those people never wake up. In former Soviet Union it is clearly visible. Even those commies who ere sent to Gulag and somehow survived, did not change their opinion not even a little. For commies Donald damage lasts forever so now they have excuse for problems for next 200 years.

They’re going to own everything for much, much longer. In two years, they will control Congress and have begun packing the courts. A million Chinese will have newly arrived to “help” us restore our manufacturing base (cough). Our IP laws and enforcement mechanisms will be detuned to contribute towards innovation that addresses climate change.
And we will begin hearing a lot of mandarin and chinese political expressions gradually being inserted into our daily lives.

                The dumb fucks don’t realize that they’re going to own every fuckup for the next four years.Uh-uh. As Juri said,“Communists never own anything. All bad is from public enemies.”Anything and everything which goes the least bit south will self-evidently be Trump’s fault in the same way that anything and everything bad that happened under O’Bozo’s regime was Bush’s fault. Face it. In the main leftists are just damned incompetent (for which I am glad since it limits the havoc they can wreak) but theONE THINGat which they are truly,TRULYgood is deflecting blame. Mark my words. Anything and everything for which Kameltoe and her buddies do not wish to claim credit will beALLTRUMP’SFAULT!!!Make book on it.

        “The people celebrating Biden think they will get reeducation camps and proscription lists, but instead they will end up with a less coherent version of Bush II.”
And just a few hours ago, Bush II called Biden and congratulated him. These people are worse than we CAN imagine.

            They’re all part of the same fraternity, man. Which I’m sure you already knew, but I had to say it anyhow.
Funny, though; can’t you imagine Biden receiving that call while having one of his episodes where is brain is starved for oxygen like he’s in the “death zone” on Everest or K2. I don’t know why but thoughts like that come to mind and make me LOL!

                    No place for whites to run anymore. They better grow a spine and cajones if they want to live.Learn to the hunter not the hunted.Remember what AS wrote in the Gulag Archipelago. In portion he talks about if men would simply shoot dead the Commie goons who come to take them away. AS wrote to the effect that if enough people had killed these goons the others  would have backed off.In another  part he mentions a man who killed a communist guard, took his gun and ammo. Evenutally he killed something like 30 of his pursuers. AS said if 5000 men in Russia were like him the Communists would have lost.

                    Seems to me that the circular firing squad aspect of the left, while real, in the sense that cannibalism is a natural attribute of leftism, it seems to fall short of actually helping or advancing the interests of our side. It offers amusement and I suppose a speed brake on the crazy train, but stops short of delegitimizing their grip on actual levers of power. Perhaps its iterative. Like a PCR test. And after 35 years – or maybe generations, it finally flips positive.

Good catch- they’re soon to make their bid for supremacy, another puppet front for the elites.

Bidenites and BLM are already punching each other.

                        Muzzies are not impressed by our effiminate elites and their lawyers like Podesta. Nor are the hard core Marxists. They will use those elites and then simply take their wealth and power.That’s what happened with the Roman elite. Once whites are no longer the backbone of the military and it’s full of ethnics they will no longer obey their white masters and that will be that.

Since I figure Kameltoe will have executed her 25thA coup by the end of summer, I figureAOC, Omar, Tlaib, Pressley etc will be happy soon enough.

                    It’s worse than merely being mistaken: he lied. There were no high-tech caves in Tora-Bora.  There were no WMDs in Iraq (the Niger docs were proved to be forgeries.) The anthrax came from the US, etc. Oh, and it took 14 years for the redacted 28 pages from the JIST report re: Saudi involvement in 9/11 to be released. And people who were at ground zero continue to die horrible deaths after he sent the Whitman woman from the EPA to say the air quality there wasn’t dangerous.

                        Whitman, former NJ Governor, like Bush, had large family background with Eisenhower Repubs.  Also, were of “elite” social status; same is true of creeps like Robert Mueller.  All attended the “best” private schools before heading to the Ivy League.  They’re screwed though as these institutions are being sued for systemic racism of one kind or another.  They may hate Trump, but their kind will be gone in 20 yrs. and the schools will be unrecognizable if still functioning.  Who’s going to contribute to the “Annual Fund” if your grandkids are being replaced by a bunch of Hindoos?

            I always thought Bush the Lesser was a decent, moral human being.  But then he started palling around with Clinton, and joking about them being brothers.  This is a man who likely raped a woman, engaged in routine sexual assault and probably had sex with minors on Epstein’s island.  And yet Bush II looked down on Trump as being immoral.  Yes, they are worse than we can imagine.

        Go deeper. Once upon a time, the weak and the stupid died young, did not reproduce, and the strong and the smart dominated the gene pool. And the species rose to the top of the life pyramid. Modern civilization and affluence has entirely reversed that dynamic, and all the maladies mentioned in this post are a consequence of ongoing and worsening DNA pollution. You cannot talk or vote your way out of this dilemma.At some point, malicious and corrupt government smashes headlong into peon fury and desperation. During the French Revolution, this unleashed chaotic destruction and imperfect culling. We can do better the next time around. We can do intelligent culling, which already exists in the world of deer hunting and some other game species.If you wanna talk hard truths that shall never be spoken, this topic is the ultimate heresy.

Do you think so? I have always thought that the race issue trumps dysgenic issue hands down. In fact, most of the people I have spoken to seem OK with the fact that we’re more cowardly and to a degree more stooopider than in the past. The topic seems far easier to bring up that race.

                Race is simply the manifestation of evolutionary selection in a particular environment. Black people (Negroids) possess the traits that worked well in the environments of central and southern Africa (this includes skin pigmentation). Caucasians possess traits that worked well in the Caucasus Region of SE Europe and SW Asia. DNA pollution takes the entire species down, and does not discriminate based on race. None of us are well adapted for the modern man-made environment of civilization in which many peoples are intermixed in places where they are not well suited.

This is why DNA pollution/dysgenic (I assume I have not conflated the two) is easier to bring up in public… It’s not racist!

                            What’s wrong with being racist???Glad you asked. Depending upon where you live it can cost you your livelihood and get your tender ass arrested and fined. Making “racist” remarks is considered “disorderly conduct” in some jurisdictions and being called out as being “racist” on social media can easily cost you your job. And you don’t have to be lily-white for this to happen, either. Look up the story about the Asian guy in Arizona who publicly challenged a Jogger taking pictures in his neighborhood, uttered aloud the alternate spelling of “jogger” and admitted to being a “racist”. He was arrested, lost his job (independent real estate contractor) and his former employer is seeking to have his real estate license revoked.Actually, it’s okay toBEa racist; it’s just not a good idea to publiclyCOPto it.

                    That situation exists among animals, too. Whitetail deer in Maine tend to be bigger than whitetail deer in Florida. Leopards and jaguars in the tropics are often black. Arctic animals are often white.Wild animals are typically more intelligent and hardier than their domesticated brethren.Difficulties arise when an animal or human who evolved to exist under certain conditions moves to a different one. The high rate of skin cancer among Whites in northern Australia is one example. During the era of genuine White Gentile supremacy in this country, blacks to some degree adopted White attitudes and behaviors. With the collapse of White domination and the welfare state, many blacks reverted back to behaviors that are normal in Africa. A propensity for stealing, male laziness and irresponsibility with women doing most of the work and supporting themselves and their children. One difference is that in Africa women cannot laze about, too, but must work because there’s no welfare outside of foreign aid.

                    Bingo!  But as to speaking of race. From my point of view in this berg it is far more common to talk of such on the radio.  Not as common to talk of specific minorities, but one hears of “Whites” having problems specific to them and their plight all the time.  Prior to a few years ago, such problems were usually spoken about as being universal in nature.  It was never Whites vs “others”.  It is now.

                        Wondering if the ratings for Political Cesspool begin to skyrocket
I had forgotten all about them until Greg Johnson was a guest the other day, I found out about through Counter Currents.
Actually for me, a little hard to believe that Political Cesspool is on an actual radio channel / Liberty Network.

                    Genetics and evolution is fascinating to read about in books geared to the layman. Even good for water cooler talk, just avoid the human races debate!Based upon my admittedly very limited knowledge, all life began with a single organism about 3.5 billion years ago. Everything, plant, animal, weird in-betweens, is a direct descendant. Talk about diversity! Mammals are relatively late on the scene, a couple hundred million years ago. Of the several million living species, there are probably a hundred or a thousand times as many extinct species. Natural selection takes no prisoners.Just recently I learned that humans (primates) are closer relatives to rodents or rabbits ( which you’ve probably seen, as well as lemurs and tree shrews which you probably haven’t), than we are to our common pets, dogs and cats.

                    Speaking of tarting up, I just read a new piece by Moldbug. That guy’s the most prolix and purple writer out there. Someone should tell him blogging is not a literary endeavor. Still, he did have one good point: for Trump to do some good, to admit that our government and our people are hostage to Big Tech, he would have to admit that even the president is powerless. It wasn’t just that he got seduced by flattery like any standard GOP pol; he couldn’t lose face by admitting that the president can’t drain the swamp, because he is not only not the most powerful man in the world, he’s not even the most powerful man in D.C.

            Modern civilization and affluence has entirely reversed that dynamic, and all the maladies mentioned in this post are a consequence of ongoing and worsening DNA pollution.
Someone on this site in just the past week was saying that evolution didn’t work on a timescale short enough to include peoples’ selection of socio-political organization. I didn’t know how to respond without being rude.

                The French managed to shave off everything to the right of the Jacobins for 230 years (and counting) with the National Razor.

                Wasting disease is found in deer populations that inhabit man-made environments devoid of predators as opposed to their natural environment of routine culling predation. This change happened in a relatively short time span. Why should our species be any different?

                    The deer explosion (at least where I am) happened due to the elimination of predators by the 19thC. combined with the clearing of the forests for agriculture and housing. More forage=more deer. Also a decline in hunting. We still have the system where if someone hits one with a car, the cops will distribute the meat to the poor.

                Agree.  One assumes a needed change to DNA in order to cause a socio-political change downstream.  Why not an underlying—existing—DNA proclivity now asserting itself due to environmental change?  Epigenetic?Here’s a somewhat similar example.  We have several Indian Nations in AZ.  Hopi tribe is perhaps the worse people in the world for obesity and diabetes.  200 years ago, they had none of these maladies.  What happened?  Reservations, change from hunter-gatherer lifestyle, and 20th century processed fatty, sugary faux food.This has been researched, even written about.  Last I heard however, those brave enough to research such have been cast into the void.

                A lot of evolutionists tend to paint with a broader brush than the paradigm permits. At it’s root, evolution is simply a change in DNA that permanently alters a physical characteristic of a species. By definition, it is not a response to the alteration of an environment. By the most scientific understanding of the term, no political system evolves at all, it simply changes. While evolution is a fascinating scientific concept about the serendipitous alteration of DNA sequences as a result of procreation, it literally is nothing more than that, so extending the concept to sociology, or dating, or politics is incredibly stupid.

            Since I’ve broken the taboo and not been banned, I will press my case. If we continue down this road of ever-increasing technology based complexity and faux (read unearned) affluence, the species (in theory) will homogenize into a few archetypes and morph into an insect-like hive model. This will likely include an elite ruling cadre, a sycophant coterie (MSM), an entropic bureaucracy, worker drones, and Jackboots to keep the drones in line. And this change must occur slowly and incrementally lest the peasants revolt when their future becomes apparent.

                Works for me. Sounds like 1973’s “Hellstrom’s Hive” by Frank Herbert. Got a copy in my library. Have to get it out and revisit it.Then again I’m reminded of Robert A. Heinlein’s sage words regarding specialization                    ;A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.

        This is why it is OK that Trump lost (fair or by cheating, doesn’t matter). He has served his purpose, which was exposing the hatred the elites have for commoners and the complete corruption of the system. There is not much more he would have done over the next 4 years. The enemy owns the system and they are progressing with or without their man the the top political post.The dissident right now needs reinvigorate itself and take advantage of this exposure.

            I’m coming around to this view. Everything got worse under Trump, not necessarily his fault, and now we have 2 odious creatures who will inadvertently or maliciously reveal the plot and red pill normiecons whether they like it or not. Plus Trump could actually follow thru with the network rumor which, God willing, isn’t a gatekeeping limited hangout. We’ll know if Z-man and Jared Taylor get their own prime time show.

                Netanyahu thinks that a Biden-Harris presidency would be better for Israel?  It gives the lie that the Democrats are anti-semitic.  A few are, but the Party as a whole is staunchly pro-Israel.  Democratic politicians are bought just like Republican politicians are.  AIPAC would lose influence under the Democrats to JStreet.  Either way, Israel always wins.The Israel worshippers must be torn between their fidelity to the US and what they thought was our bestest friend Israel.  They loved Netanyahu, too.

            I thought this the other day, too.  Second terms have not been kind to any Presidents I can think of, even if they resulted from landslide victories.  Lincoln?  Woodrow Wilson?  Ike?  Nixon?  Bill Clinton?  I can’t get myself to spit out the name or identifying initial of that jerkwater Baby Bush and his lackluster two-term presidency; last but not least, it was Barack Obama’s second term that made Donald Trump possible, as others have noted.  FDR health failings were covered for by the media, much as the situation today.  WWII made it unpatriotic to change horses in mid-stream, blah blah, and FDR was an awesome liar — the best!  Get this — he was only in his sixties when he died!

Damn. He could have easily passed for someone in his 70s. Hell, he wasn’t quite 51 when he first took office. Who says “Only the good die young”?

        The 2016 election was the first time in my lifetime (and maybe the last) that anything even close to the will of the people was addressed in rhetoric, if not in substance. The elite obviously found it horrifying and took steps to prevent a repeat. The few remaining genuinely civic-minded journalists are convinced Silicon Valley overplayed their hand by censoring The New York Post because it’s a 200 year-old newspaper. Big deal. America is a little older than that and it’s toast. They got away with it. Bob is dead. Forget it, Jack. It’s Chinatown.

        Not too long ago I had a conversation with my sister-in-law where she made a remark like “huh, that cold war was a pretty big deal wasn’t it?”  “WTF?”, I thought, but then realized she was just young enough that she didn’t sit through endless nuclear war apocalypse-porn movies (Terminator being perhaps the most well known), school teachers talking about how Reagan was going to blow up the planet, and a legitimate fear that some political situation in within the opaque Soviet government would cause them to pour across the West German border to put an end to their political enemies.At the time the cold war ended I was very happy, no longer would the civil air raid siren herald in the end times and, especially, the good people had won.  The Cold War couldn’t go on forever, but in the end victory defeated us.

            I think that’s one reason for the growing support for communism and avowed atheism throughout the West.  A tail-end Boomer like myself remembers the “Evil Empire” and “godless communism.”  Communism’s promises never panned out, what with long lines to purchase consumer goods, gulags and high-ranking individuals fleeing with just the clothes on their backs.There’s more of an obviously racial element involved, as well.  Jews have always been heavily involved in communism (Hillaire Belloc called bolshevism “a jewish movement” in his book The Jews), but there are reinforcements coming from other non-White groups.  I think that blacks had no interest in communism back in the 1930s (correct me if I’m wrong), but BLM is an avowed Marxist movement.  Their Marxism is probably pretty basic – kill Whitey and take their stuff.  Marxism justifies what they want to do anyway.

                Don’t have links and details, but quite a few of the more successful blacks (i.e. in movies and education) were very attracted to Marxism in the early years.  Check out Paul Robeson.  Marxism was/is the product of an aggrieved race so it suits noggers to a T.

                    Blacks such as Robeson (huge talent as opera star) were fawned over visiting USSR and shown “Potemkin” villages full of goodies and happy workers — with no racial prejudice!

Associate of Harry Bridges.  Lots of interracial “sexing” went on, too, to break down normal allegiance for one’s own background and they invented the word “racism” to use against anyone who objected to this practice.

            “…in the end victory defeated us.”That’s a good way of staying it, Sandmich. It ties in with the point that having a powerful, long term enemy keeps a society sober, focused, and impatient with corrosive nonsense. It keeps decision making in the hands of men, and those generations that are mature and experienced, but still actively engaged in life. That’s the opposite of our present age, governed by the immature (not necessarily young) and those who’ve entered sentimental, even self-centered old age (and soon senility).I would add that theprosecutionof the Cold War is also implicated in our present troubles. It’s clear to me now that many of the societal ideas that were promoted as virtues to distinguish The West from Soviet Communism only served to distort the American idea of society.In retrospect, the idea that America should be generously open to immigrants was only promoted as a virtue to heighten the contrast to a Soviet Union that wouldn’t let anyone out; there was no “objective” reason to see that as a good policy, and in fact America had held quite a different policy prior to the Cold War. We embraced it as a part of our rivalry with the Soviets; but now they’re gone and the policy is irrationally ingrained in our national psyche.

                I admit that I stole the line from The Dark Knight (“Peace has cost you your strength, Victory has defeated you”):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdM46G984vwGiven the not subtle message of the movie, the line probably means exactly what we think it means.

        Facebook was relentlessly gaslighting about how secure American elections are and suppressing your most basic right-wing memes.Normies are now abandoning Facebook and Twitter for Parler.While not the best choice, and the only good choice will be some sort of blockchain-based censorproof forum, a lot of what Facebook and Twitter are tasked with now is giving legitimacy to an obviously corrupt system.If even your basic civnat is leaving the hostile digital sphere for another, two parallel societies will slowly form.  If the rural-urban divide keeps becoming more stratified, people will continue to segregate until a good portion of the country can just laugh at and ignore what is happening in Washington.Everyone is encouraged to support any shitlord who gets elected or openly flaunts Washington D.C.Support your local warlord.

            I already find it difficult to believe my local good ‘ol boy rural sheriff will participate in any scheme to round up or disarm dissidents, and the state police simply aren’t capable of going door to door here in the hills, no less the feds. At some point, big parts of the country are already or will become ungovernable by the far-away urban elites. Even stuff like the mask mandates are all but ignored.
Like Soviets, we put on acts of official compliance when The Man is looking our way, but flaunt him in private.

                        It is telling how the “vote” is like everything else in the end: data.Notice how quickly how the precious kernel of Democracy is reduced to two states of being: media narrative and big data.The story is about the will of the people but the fight will be made into one of data. We don’t own our data. The end.All those votes were googled into property of one corporation or the other. Once cast into the system, digitized into electrons of liberty, the end user agreement says who owns it.The adjudication of what comes next then becomes one of moral storytelling and lawyered-up techno arbitration.Sorry Citizen, all your vote are belong to us. Try again in four years.

                I could force mandatory buyback compliance for any registered gun owner within a few days at max. skeptic, below, mentioned this but didn’t expand on why.1) Take list of registered firearm owners2) Take list to banks3) Tell banks to FREEZE accounts until compliance with new federal law is accepted4) Cucked and pozzed BLM supporting (((Banks))) gladly comply w/ new federal mandate5) You are now shut off from your money hence your livelihood.6) The vast majority of people even ‘muh Constitution’ and ‘muh guns’ are f-cking LARPers who will go along to get along7) Most guns are now safely removed from circulation with the unregistered / kits being a fraction of what is out there.8) Gulag away!Easy peasy, if this sounds like a blackpill or far fetched you clearly havenotbeen paying attention for the last 4 years and especially since last Tuesday.

                        Me too. Problem being I am more likely than you are, Vizzini, to use one of my firearms for self-defense given where I live. That’s when my plans break down because I will be sent to die in prison and forfeit my assets for non-compliance. But if I do not use my firearms then what was the point in having them and incurring the associated risks?

                    That is a nasty hypothetical.Let me counter, there are enough people at State and Local level on both sides  who would oppose that with succession or force to make that chancy . Besides  tools . knowledge to make firearms and already made ammo are easy to get.A homemade suppressed SMG is more effective than an AR in many situations. Not legal so don’t go be making them now but you get the picture If YOU and I mean YOU won’t hunt when people are starving your and your family to death you deserve what you get even if they don’t. Death is better.Also stockpile food while you can, the system even in peacetime is becoming brittle.Historically this type of overt comply or starve warfare often makes sure that soft targets will be hit and hard,Its fine and good to make war on peoples families but organized society isn’t much fun when you are terrified you kids and grand kids will end up in a  political Red Room somewhereGo read Sipsey Street Irregularsfor this(back from 2010) basically at that point there are no limits on target or tactics, Its the Rwanda part of Bosnia X Rwanda.All the opprobrium you’d face from your side for dirty tactics would be gone as well not that dirty warfare is a large group thing.And as for the media opinion. It only matters now while thinsg are OK. At that point the fact you breath makes you worse than Hitler and even Clinton knew enough to know the media is a war time target (c.f the Clinton Doctrine)

                “flout” = to show contempt or disdain; “flaunt” = to show off. Well ok, you can flaunt in private, but no one will notice Actually, you’re not wholly wrong, since to flout implies to openly mock something.Of course the “Wicked government agents will confiscate guns and round up dissidents” is an important plot element in many scenarios, and certainly is possible. However, it is also problematic. All but the craziest tyranny is usually pragmatic. If those in power have what they want (power at least), and the rabble in the hinterlands have guns, so what? Unless they pose some type of opposition or threat to those in power, what reason would those in power have in attacking them, especially if it would be costly in terms of time, power, lives of henchmen, etc?

            Anecdotal, but I am seeing a serious shift in CivNats.  My wife and her fellow conservative suburban friends with whom she networks are angry.  Until Tuesday, they believed America was good.  Now they see something being stolen from them, being covered up by the MSM, and even Fox News turning on them.  They are boycotting Fox News, moving off of Twitter and Facebook, etc.Since my thesis is that the ruling class is as incompetent as it is nefarious, I think they have misread things a bit and have overplayed their hand.  I think they believed their propaganda organs would get everyone in line.  The opposite is happening – just about every single one of Trump’s 70 million voters now believe something is being stolen from them – not just an election but their country and way of life.  They are coming to the realization that the whole system and society is corrupt beyond any possibility of reform.Huge opportunity for the DR.

                They assume American whites are the same as European and Canadian whites. “Official media sources” could declare that the sky is green and Canadian whites would gobble it up.
American whites are the only white population with a critical mass of badwhites (55% in USA, 15% in Canada). When someone is bullshitting me, I say fuck you and point a middle finger right back, and do the opposite just to spite. Stubborn bastards. The elites don’t seem to understand this reaction, or calculate for it.

                    Not true at all. The Yellow Vests (Gillete Juanes) rioted and protested on a scale never seen in the US.There were millions of them all over France in the street clashing with police and they were all Les Deplorables not City Commies.There are also as Charles the Okay  noted a lot of protests in Europe ongoing right now.Our media ignores this because it doesn’t suit the narrative.The Us doesn’t have any real sense of national identity do to its size and diversity.Even Bad Whites despite decades of WN attempts do not have  a monolithic identity.This is logical in that the US is an entire continent pretending to be a country. Its properly Whites only here at least 11 nations , possibly more.This combined with our nonsensical ideas of individualism  do to our creation during the age of enlightenemnt and our atomized lifestyles do to capitalism and mobility and we have the recipe for lack of identity or cooperation on large scale.This is subject to rapid change and is changing however but truth is as modernity goes collective living in the tribal sense will reoccur as will such delights as collective liability, collective punishment and guilt by association on the Right not just the Left.

        Liberal democracy’s biggest problem is that it can never say “no.”  So when man in sun dress walks into a city council meeting to demand a right, he’s never abruptly cut off with the mayor saying “get the hell out of here you degenerate!”   Because liberal democracy can never say no, it’s been saying “yes” to every new program to come down the road, to a point where our private sector is crowded out (socialism..it’s already here) and where employees of bloated bureaucracies, to keep the gravy train going, perpetuate the insanity.  Also, all kinds of government grants and assistance and subsidies take a citizen who once would have spoken his or her mind to power and makes him or her complicity silent.  Even Medicare and Social Security are perfect examples of this.  The death of liberal democracy is when the bread runs out for the circus.  However, in a post Bretton-Woods environment, there’s no brakes on this either.  The bread will never run out, it’ll simply become inedible.

        Yes, this push for everyone to vote is interesting, but it’s related to our deification of democracy. Not voting is like not going to church in a theocracy, and we most certainly life in a theocracy.
51% of the vote = The Truth
But as I pointed out to a relative this weekend, democracy loses its legitimacy (if not its authority) when one group no longer views the entire country’s population as “their” people. At that point, democracy becomes tyranny.

It appears virtue signalling is tribalism, the instinct to tribe up, to seek and find birds of a feather. And callous to outsiders or consequences.

            Agreed.Our esteemed blog host has not only missed the mark here, he’s screwed the pooch and shat the bed!If all a vote is, is a flip of the middle finger at Lefty… yeah, I’ll take half a day off work and go down and vote. If all it does is counter some pink haired 400 lb. lesbian‘s vote… it’s a good deal. If all it does is make it harder for some low IQ black baboon work harder to rig the vote…I’m in!👍Yes, those cretins ARE evil people and we shouldn’t dismiss that or minimize it. They’re rigging the vote because most of them hate you so much, they’d kill you and take your chit if they could. The BLM naggers are doing that on a weekly basis now. That  horse faced clot headed cnut, AOC – wants lists of Blumpf supporters so that punitive action can be taken against them later on. How many of you are posting at Gab because you can’t sound off on Twatter or Bookface? How many of you have had your families ruined by shitlib women with their ridiculous ideas of feminism and social justice? Or by queers or degenerates?Yes, these people ARE evil and to hate them isn’t partisan at all. In the days ahead it will be a coping and self defence mechanism. We could have stood up to this shite ages ago. We need to stand up to it now. Lefty is now trampling on your rights in broad daylight, in your face, and promises you more. It’s only going to get worse.Hmmmmmm. Could our dissidence be a mere intermediate step as we transition to partisanship?

                Spot on! Z messed up on this post. Voting does matter at least on the local level. Anything to make the Left work harder, spend more money etc. Is a good thing.Just sitting at home and doing nothing as Z advocates isn;t a strategy at all. It’s capitulation.And yeah the DR is merely transistory. It will change as life gets harder for whites.

            Yup, the swings get wider and faster until someone or something steps back to let things settle.  In this frenzied age, who is going to step back?  In the absence of cooler heads, only a catastrophic collapse of the whole thing will stop the swings, which now appears to be our most likely outcome, IMHO.

            It’s a common misconception that just being a high ranking official, even President, gets you access to sensitve data. Nothing could be further from the truth. A lot of stuff is so classified even the classifcation terms are classified 🙂

        Brings to mind scenes of a pro football game
You have the total fanatical crazies in the stands with halloween costumes on screaming for their teams and shaking their fists in an ice storm, hurling beer bottles at the opposing team
Then you have the quiet family of four sitting as if in church all wrapped up in ski coats and mittens and a wool cap with the team logo
You would think the latter would be a better fit to decide the fate of society.  But NOPE.   We got the crazies making the decisions.

                                That too.  All that is needed is a sycophant MSM and the disease disappears.  The MSM will carry water for the explanation of continuing cases—and a few deaths now and then—as those poor unfortunate 10%, or the assholes refusing vaccine who deserve such.  But all you “smart” people who took the vaccine are safe and can go out again thanks to Biden and his decision to follow “science”.
Yep, people are that stupid.

Nah. They have the Red Queen beat hands down when it comes to believing impossible things. Just as Progs can speak out of both sides of their mouth – at theSAME TIME– they can do what passes for thinking with both sides of their brain.

Heard a spokesman from Pfizer. He said 90% effective in that “symptoms minimized (no complications) and no deaths”. Sounded awfully like he was walking back the MSM raves. You can still get sicker than a dog. I also wonder if the current COVID strain is not weaker than the first wave, which would explain a lot of the current low mortality.

                                    Actually that just sounds like what is already happening. A lot of the “cases” are just false positives so of course there are no symptoms. As for the lower death rate, this could simply be due to the fact that most of the people who were going to die from it died back in the spring.  It also wouldn’t surprise me at all if virtually everyone has already been exposed to it by now and the current hysteria is all an attempt to prevent the arrival of what’s been here for months.In any case, I’m pretty sure the truth will only be known years from now if ever and will need to be translated into English because the medical and scientific professions in the anglophone world are morally bankrupt and utterly lacking in probity.It’s sad really because there was and is a serious health issue but the media and their scientific enablers have piled so many layers of hysterical horseshit on top that no one believes anything they say.But look on the bright side, they managed to finish discrediting the US election process because now we will probably never be able to get rid of mail-in ballots AND they managed to give America her first Undead-American and soon to be first Sex-Worker-American President!

                                    Wasn’t there an ‘S’ and and ‘L’ strain, one weaker and nonlethal?  So the hosts don’t die, making a weakening spread, aka herd immunity.
Nonetheless, I note near the bottom that they just announced the Pfizer HealthPass, proof of vaccination, will be required by air lines, cruise lines, and employer/insurers.

                                Hey! My son along with his father-in-law are both living with PTSD – my son from Operation Desert Storm (he went into Kuwait City mere hours after the Iraqis left. He also wok up next to a dead Iraqi soldier.) and his father-in-law from 2 tours in the Nam including a close encounter with a land mine that netted him 2 artificial knee joints. Note that a soldier who served a single tour in the Nam spent more time in combat conditions/mortal peril than a Roman Legionnaire did in their entireCAREER!If you put sane men into insane conditions you should not be surprised if it induces a degree of insanity.

                            Contrary to popular misconception, Dr. Guillotin did not actually invent the execution machine which bears his name. All he did was promote it as a “humane” way to execute criminals. BTW, there is evidence to suggest that those who experienced an encounter withMadame Le Guillotinmay well have survivedAND REMAINEDCONSCIOUSANDAWAREfor upwards of a minute after their heads fell into the basket. Only good way to go by my reckoning is quietly in your sleep. Had an Aunt who went that way. Kissed my Uncle good-night, told him she loved him and died quietly in her sleep.

            Never will they lose another election, starting with GA senate runoff.“The most legal immigration in history”, sucking up to black rappers, putting violent felons back onto the street, and reee’ing about how granny boomer should die for the economy will do that to you. BTW, there was a swing to Biden in the White demographic across much of the country, so the voter fraud narrative isn’t terribly persuasive. That demographic shifted Georgia and Pennsylvania away from Trump. Seniors enraged over Trump’s poor Covid performance flipped Pennsylvania and White suburbanites scared of Atlanta blacks flipped Georgia. You people did that. Covid was your hill. You died on it. Enjoy this guy’s ranting about the disease that impacts his bottom line, because that’s the only explanation for his obsession with it.Church of Covid.Congratulations on writing the 10,000th article on Covid-19. That was the hill you wanted to die on, and you just did. Donald Trump lost the election due to your* ceaseless posturing and whining about “face diapers”, just as I predicted he would on this blog weeks ago (remember, Z thought Trump might get over 50% of the popular vote … lol, nope).Years from now, when the democrats control everything — as the police state worsens — I wonder if any of you people will look back and question if it was really worth losing power just to “own the libs” and posture about how macho you are because you called a guy a c*uck on social media for wearing a mask?Nah, who am I kidding? This side of the political aisle is easily led around by their noses by grifters and special interests — Tea Party, MAGA, Israel Lobby, Covidians. What a waste of space. The guy publishing this stuff is a businessman, so his bottom line is hurt by Covid-19. In order to maximize his pocketbook, he’s built a cult following of dumb conservatives willing to advance his financial interests to their detriment. He makes money and you lose the election. Was that a good trade?*Note to people of low reading comprehension: the implication here is that I mean “your” as in the Covidians who insist on ranting about this issue endlessly, not this specific blog. That kind of rhetoric worked its way up to Trump’s social media and he repeated these talking points to his detriment. For example, Donald Trump repeated Pat Buchanan’s talking point on Covid in several of his Tweets. Bad advice, padre. Granny boomer is now ride’n with Biden all the way to inauguration day.

            No the replacement will go on. Z is dead wrong thinking it’s business as usual with a Kamala regime. This is what I would have expected from Juan Williams or Marie Harf not a supposed thought leader of the DR.As a Californian I see how the Left is relentless in their efforts to turn the state into another Venezuela, It is not business as usual and is why the white professional class are fleeing like rats leaving a sinking ship.And Kamala is Newsom on steroids.

I am stumbling into behavior among the sober and hard minded to suggest these idiots have stirred up a Hornets nest among normies, including normie small businessmen. Esp normie small business.   With no more COVID PPP in sight and our noses being rubbed in shit publicly ala dumb fraud something quietly profound has changed.

Tend to agree. To win, Trump needs a million things to go right in the legal process, they only need a few things to go wrong.

I understand the math they’re using to test for fraud, but math n’ graphs is the fastest way to put C+ normies to sleep.

Personally, the future the Marxists have planned for us is not one that I believe is worth living.

                Pessimistically, a lot of things have been given away, over a very long period of time. Here is a very partial list:1861-5 Rights of States to govern themselves (with final nails in coffin into mid-20th century);1914 Federal Reserve Act1933 Gold removed as US money1934 Firearms act1948, 1952, 1964 “civil rights” decisions/laws that took away rights to private contract, freedom of association of private individuals.I’m sure there’s many I’ve overlooked. Point is, a lot of freedoms have been taken without a shot being fired (ok, ex-Civil War), and it’s not clear how much remains for them to take away.

        “Every issue, instead of being a fight between interested parties, is a fight for eternal truth and cosmic justice.”I am right wing because I care about my posterity’s future (and my ancestors’ sacrifice to get me here) not about moral abstractions. E.g. I think abortion is a woman murdering her baby but as an issue it’s low on the list of things that motivate me.

            OK, what about your people’s posterity?  If your people’s women are free to murder their unborn children, will there be a “your people” in the future? Or do you just see your ideal future as your own clan, inbred and alone, on some isolated mountaintop? What is the point of your progeny having a future, if in the process their people die out and leave them to be a hated, hunted minority?  Collective defense has as a prerequisite the existence of a collective.

            You think the CIA that spawned Clapper is, what, too patriotic and red-blooded American to try a Color Revolution in the USA? You think they have these tools, see this “threat” to their very existence, and just sit idly by? We know that’s not the case, see Comey and his troop of r-tards. The only question is HOW, not IF the alphabet soup “intelligence” community interfered in this election.  Election voting software makes good sense: see the Law of Liberal Projection.  If they are claiming Trump “hacked the election” with Rushing Collusion, you can guaran-damn-tee they actually have some sort of software exploit in some part of the election process. Do not ascribe to stupidity what is actually our enemies’ malice.  They. Want. You. Dead.

                The government is a comedy of errors.  If any of these people had a brain they would be in the private sector.  Everyone is so quick to believe some rumor about internet connected software changing votes when in reality you had millions of mail in ballots sent out like Publishers Clearinghouse sweepstakes, with thousands of them ending up in trash cans, on floors of mail centers, and being harvested door to door by Acorn like orgs.  This election was decided when Republican state legislatures buckled to crazy mask ladies who thought, last April, that the virus would kill them at voting booths.

                    JR, I’m of the opinion it was “all of the above” on cheating, and it was still not enough, and they had to go to flat-out posting millions of fake votes last Tuesday night, to get their preferred result.  Have you seen the county or precinct maps, where almost all of them are always red?  That’s the truth of the thing, and they work 24/7 to engineer a work-around, by any and all strategies.

                        Trump won in a massive blowout, insane white turnout in PA gave him almost as many votes as Obama in 08. The polls that said trump was down 17% in Wisconsin now say he lost white male support. Bullshit.
Dems did massive fraud in WI and had to run it up to 90% turnout to get a0.4% win.
You’re right, they might just be adding fake votes into the system at this point. Balls to the wall now.

        The threat of extinction is obvious. Having overcome all other obstacles, only the grave is left. The big one.

That’s what it comes down to. Hence an election turning on a highly contagious but not very deadly virus. Those of guilty conscience see the grim reaper everywhere.

Those who’ve forgotten immortality is in their kids and grandkids, their nation.

Take heart. Brighter days are ahead, probably sooner than you think.

            Boomers and leftists are terrified of death, they live an empty soulless life and there is no redemption at the end. The COVID hysteria is partly a response to that.
You can lock down society and destroy future generations but you can’t avoid the end fate – burning in the Lake of fire and eternal damnation. Leftists know what is coming even if they reject religion.

                Still painting with a too broad brush.
If it wasn’t for Boomers, and some gen X’ers, you’d hear no calls to reopen society and stop the lockdowns.  If I had to paint with a broad brush, it would be to point out women as a class for fearfulness and safety over reason and responsibility.  But then that would wrong the strong, intelligent, thoughtful women who post here.

                        Who’s holding back the torch?  I simply remark that the follow on generations are pretty quick to blame someone else for their predicament, e.g., Boomers, and yet are—in the given example—absent from the forefront of current efforts to amend the situation.Now some of such I understand.  Follow on generations neither have the resources, nor standing in technical fields and institutions as do Boomers and X’ers.But I also note for the record, it’s not Boomers attending the nightly riots that are going on for literally months in our major cities.  I’ve never criticized the younger generation that I recall.  And have always acknowledged that the America they were born in was less conducive to prosperity and personal success than mine.  I simply maintain that “Boomers screwed things up” is way too simplistic an explanation.

                            Apologies for coming in hot, Compsci. I know you’re generally on the right side of things.However, we’re about to be ruled by an Alzheimer’s patient and his diverse replacement. Rioting millennial flotsam didn’t cause that to be, in fact, they hurt its chances. It wasn’t the young clamoring for masks and curve flattening.It wasn’t my 20-50 year old friends and family I was yelling at to keep their heads this past spring. It wasn’t smiling zoomer couples I saw driving Austin-Healeys and Chevy Novas this weekend. It wasn’t my millennial neighbor setting off fireworks Saturday night.It was my dad who visited me and tried to buy my compliance with my great grandfather’s deer rifle. (I refused it.)It was panic, lockdowns, and mail in voting that made this possible, and anybody who doesn’t know why all that happened is being invincibly ignorant.That’s in the past, but right now there are people with life ahead of them who are being ruined, children growing up with masks, being robbed of a normal childhood. All because in the beginning of this people with most of their lives behind them were worried about meeting their fate.Among the people I talk to, patience is not weakness, despair gives way to desperation, hearts harden into resolve.

That’s quite poetical.I will mention that in ascribing blame for the election, the national map basically shows all red except for the mostly-coastal big-city blues. From where I sit, in the middle of the SF Bay Area, the problem is not demographic, but geographic: SF, LA and NY.

                                Painter,Let me only say here is that fate is unforgiving.What do I mean by that?  The more you fixate on the boomers, for example, the more you open your own life to becoming the same thing.   In other words, everything you are saying about the boomers, not so much blaming them but assigning some of your own dissatisfaction over to to them, is what the generation under you or two under you will be saying and claiming about you.  Basically, payback is a bitch.But but but how can they?  I was the one sticking up for them?  I was the one who was on the side of the righteous?I don’t have answers to that.  But I can point to family life.  It NEVER dawned on me or occurred to me that my son would resent me.  I was always the cool dad.  Could never happen.  But it did.  It was a phase, but it happened.  Children will find a way to resent their parents or elders.  Every time you think you are setting yourself up where you can’t be assailed by them, think you’re perfectly situated where they can’t find a chink in your armor, they will find a way over or under or through your armor into your heart.  Because life demands it as part of its cycles.   Like a blade of grass will always find a way to break through the best laid driveway. You can’t stop it.But you can somewhat alter its trajectory.   And life does have a sense of fairness. So if you lay off the boomers, and one day these young kids come blaming you for their problems, you can know deep down you don’t deserve their crap because you never did that to your elders, and they’ll sense it and leave you be.Take it for what it’s worth.  But just a life lesson I wanted to share.

                                    Thank you.I’ll admit I’m going off my experience of having boomer parents, boomer superiors in the workplace. What I’ve found is they respect strength, even to the point of being a dick and pulling power moves. Not making that up right now, I’ve said it before on here, not that I’d expect anyone to remember.I don’t resent them, it’s that it’s time for a new story, time for the torch to be passed. Hell, they did their thing back in the 60s, so I can’t feel too badly about it.Besides, people were sent to nursing homes to die, Biden talked about a long dark winter and I take him at his word. Don’t want to go there.Believe me I’m not fueled by resentment. Playing along, doing what I was told, built what resentment I’ve had. Lesson learned.Now as for parenting, yikes, but I’m sure everybody feels that way 🙂

                they live an empty soulless life and there is no redemption at the end.


That’s right.

One of the fundamental problems with the West is too many people living totally empty, debt-funded, keep up with the Joneses lifestyles.

These people have endless college, mortgage, auto, and credit card debt.

That’s it.
Their subconscious knows exactly how empty their lives are.

            Well said, painter.  Why does “some people’s” foolish desire for actual immortality, that dread fear of the hereafter that comes only from a guilty conscience and an unsaved soul, trump my children’s right to have a normal childhood and go trick-or-treating without these bizarre freaks with their social-compliance fetishes scaring them with these pointless masks?  You’re going to die, Boomer.  We all will, eventually. No need to take all of civilization with you.

As for atheistic freedom, men aren’t fit for it. Being creatures we lack the wisdom to master Creation. Not unlike Agent Smith trying to take over the Matrix.  Such arrogance deserves to be punished.

                Most people in my area demanding masks and that wanted no door knocking at Halloween are not boomers.  Face diaper crowd seems to have no age limitations.  There probably is a link between lack of spirituality and a debilitating fear of death.Now, I think everyone has thoughts about their death.  Most want to put it off as long as reasonably possible, especially if they have others that depend on them for their welfare.

        RE your Taki article, you mention there Andrew Cuomo re his handling of the coof. He also gave a wonderful expression of what you call “build back better” ever before then. Back when Trump was shiny and new, he responded to the idea of MAGA by solemnly intoning (like a high school principal warning about something the kids may think is “cool” but really isn’t if you think about it) “America was never great.” He had to quickly walk it back (it’s likely why he never replaced Biden on the ticket) but like all “gaffes” it was the truth, at least as seen by the hordes for whom “college educated” means not reading Plato but being stuffed for four years with Howard Zinn and that “Lies My Teacher Told Me” book. I thought then and now it was a great way to define the partisans.

        Excellent piece, Z-Man.I would argue that naked partisanship, in place of rouged up civic virtue, got its meathooks into America in the 1960s with identity politics. Sure, most white people continued believing or professing to believe, that they were voting for the objective public good. However, the reality was that every fringe group, from blacks to heaumeaux (and the roster of dysfunctionals has since grown geometrically) began agitating for their group interests, the public good be damned. And as the number of partisan loci increased, any sense of a common and comprehensive good was torn asunder. We now live in the smoking multicultural rubble of a once great nation.

            Identity politics was ALWAYS around, only white people were fed lies by the pop culture back then to fall asleep.   They saw Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner and actually started fantasizing about their spoiled brat daughter meeting some Sidney Poitier and having hybrid babies with her.  The drumbeat actually started in the 50’s.

Also, the GI Bill was extended to feminist education in the 50s, for all those would-be Rosie Riveters- except they didn’t teach riveting.

                I dropped Takimag, which I used to enjoy, once the unworthy wench assumed the throne. But I would still drop serious coin on the opportunity for cocktails and stories with Taki himself. He’s the last of a breed.

                    I actually knew, although not well, the original author of the “Bunky Mortimer” column in Takimag; he was so cool, sauve, handsome and full of self-deprecating humor.  Passed away a few years’ ago.  Big squash player in NYC.  Father owned a famous race track in Central FL.  Now it’s written by a poser who thinks he can imitate Bunky’s style.  Sigh.

                        With you on Bunky. I would have liked to hang out with the right honorable gentleman. I used to play squash. There’s something satisfying about smacking a ball with a racquet, and sometimes your adversary with the racquet. But I quit the club that had the courts once I was mostly just using its restaurant. I like that breed of Taki and Bunky. I’ll do drive-bys to read The Zeeeeeeeee-man. I actually read Z because I like his cat.

                            Went to High school with a guy nicknamed “Bunky”. Had him for “home room”. Seems he spent part of his grade school years living next door to the home room teacher. She “outed” him the first time she called roll, “Oh, hi, Bunky.” Poor beggar never lived it down. All the way to senior year people would greet him with,“Oh, hi, Bunky.”﻿William “Bunky” McQueen, Highlands HS class of 1969

        The Electors don’t turn in their vote until December 14th, yet the Biden team is demanding the GSA certify the handover.

(The GSA director refuses, and is being castigated as a Trump-picked loyalist for following the law and Constitution.)

                    Not saying invisible, just below radarEither way, I am heading in that direction and play to stay that way for foreseeable future.  But I have been planning this for yers, nothing to do with Obama or Trump.  Meaning, I plan to stop doing what I do to support myself and will be putzing around playing or teaching tennis, my true love, or traveling and hitting the beach for a few years, my other love.  I am 53 and have busted my ass since I was 21 years old and feel I’ve earned a little reprieve.But, sure, if it sounds sexier saying I am dropping out to make a political statement, yeah, I can always play that card too 😉

                        Brother, you don’t need to bounce your disengagement off people. It’s human. But it’s not a mirror to hold up, because it’s not scaleable. I only say that, not because I think I’m better, but because I’ve been there, and in hindsight, it’s not the absolute strategy that needs promoting. It is fine and good  for someone in your shoes and effective as well, but not universally effective.

                            Effective for what?   What’s the game plan or end game you seem to be referring to?There are 100 million non whites in this nation and I have lived in a massive multi-cultural city for a little over 30 years, and they aren’t going anywhere while my tolerance for living around and among them is over.  So given that reality and my personal situation, I have decided to get away from them.  Step 1.Step 2 is to find a place.  Which I sorta have.  Something of a work in process, but getting there.  But when I find a place I have a few options:1) Ignore the political process, drop out, play tennis, do my own thing.  Focus on family and living healthy and getting exercise.2) Stress myself out over things I can’t change, like I have been over the past 30 years plus, the main thing being a massive non white population that I know will NEVER (at least in my lifetime) see things similarly to me.  So this makes politics irrelevant to me.  Sure there are local issues that may matter, but as for national politics I can’t be bothered to care because nothing  will change what matters to me most, which is living in a white country.   Noting else matters, and there is nothing I can do about it except take small personal steps to improve my own situation.But to each his own.  I am not good at politics or anything like that.  I can’t stand it tbh.  It makes my brain hurt just thinking about it.  I am best when I am left to myself and my own creativity and mindset and can do things that make people happy, such as throw parties, dinners, get things rollicking.  Just be someone out there who is an island of sanity away from this shit.  And that has value.  Always has.  Always will.  I know from experience.

        America, is analogous to the Roman Republic ca 150bc.  Both started as a small weak states and then grew exponentially by absorbing nearby areas and then conquering far away ones.  The very facto of that growth meant that it wasn’t ever a unified nation in the modern sense, but rather a collection of competing groups temporarily United by war.  Until the great enemy was dispatched, Carthage in Rome’s case and the SU in ours.  Free from a existential threat means free for the internal groups to attack each other for temporary supremacy.IMO that the dynamic with modern America.  It will ultimately end the republicans for of government as it did in the last half century bc. But the internal fighting will continue in autocratic America just as it did in imperial Rome.

I remember saying that my uncle, a doctor, was telling me it was all a scam to make money.  They (docs and hospitals) were having what amounted to “contests” like employee of the month to see who could generate the most covid counts because the federal reimbursements for covid cases were several times more than for normal things.

                Months ago, I ran simple calculations on the Diamond Princess data and came up with a total of 370k US Covid deaths.That’s in line with a moderately severe seasonal flu.I didn’t weight by age and didn’t account for the weak being culled first.I think this dataset is pessimistic because the ship population skews older and it was a confined space with plenty of opportunities for re-infection.Even juicing the death count with Dem govs murdering people, CDC paying hospitals to murder people, and CDC counting all deaths with as deaths from the US can’t get 2/3rds of my number.Given the thing is not that deadly, no one should care about asymptomatic spread, masks, or any of the other BS the flunatic fascists preach.Beer Flu is a total psyop hoax.

                    What are you talking about? Don’t gaslight us. Beer flu is bullshit but regular flu is sub 100k. Making those kind of claims just works against us. Even if they are using the difference in deaths to gaslight us also, because they are people who would have died anyway, we have no actual way of reliably determining those extra deaths. The general mortality rate has actually increased since beer flu. That is the only indicator we can use. It’s entirely possible the whole thing is part of a longer curve  metric we don’t even have yet, people dying who would have died, only earlier,  and they are using the numbers for propaganda, but this is a smart blog, not a dumb one, so the comments need to reflect the intelligence of the audience, we have elitist assholes watching.

Yes, my comment is anecdotal, but I think if you dig deeper and research this you will find evidence in support.

        Z-man I agree with everything but the conclusion. As you note, politics is now communal salvation and morality. And you certainly can see that the elites above all are prey to this. No one showed up for Biden rallies, while the elites are in a frenzy to have camps and show trials and blacklists and such. When Robert Reich calls for camps and show trials you know its on.And that gets to the second point. The years long lockdowns that sucker Naomi Wolfe now realizes is a done deal will impoverish millions and tens of millions. The only solution for that is camps.Next, the party is run by people like Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. They told that White woman to shut up and basically bum rushed Nancy Pelosi out of her own call. They don’t care if marginal congress critters get tossed out. The model of massive vote fraud means never having to say you are sorry and winning all Senate and Presidential races. That means camps for uppity Whitey.Finally, the lure of the China model “solving” for once and all their problem of obnoxious minorities is irresistable. Just like a privatized social credit scheme is now the law, so too will be camps for “security reasons.”

        Trump just brutally and publicly sacked SecDef Esper.
put Christopher miller as acting SECDEF.

Rumors/Wishes in media that Wray FBI and the Skirt DCI are next (DC media spreads rumors to get people fired) but at last Esper is gone.

Now I don’t believe in 45D or “The Plan” but its a positive action by Trump.  Maybe he just wants to live 🤣.

            Trump has gone radio silent. He made a deal, predictably, to sell out his supporters and go quietly. He will make a best a pro-forma legal challenge that is ignored. Of course he’s a fool, the fury of the elites guarantee he will be in prison the rest of his life and his kids too. But that’s it. Fox News cut away from his press conference. Telling viewers they could not allow them to hear the lies. Its over. Mitt Romney will join the Biden White House to expand ObamaCare to everything (there goes your employer insurance).At least that part is over. We White Deplorables need to think about survival. How we can bug out, how we can have liquid non freezable assets, what skills and assets we can bring to places like Chile, Argentina, Uruguay etc. We should learn Spanish now.It won’t happen right away, but lists are being made. First, utilities will be cut off for “racism” supporting Trump. Next, your bank account will be frozen. Supporting and voting Trump is a hate crime bigot! Next will come formal charges and show trials letting your neighbors know you were fond of the Four Olds or whatever. You will probably wear a dunce hat while trannies and lesbians scream at you. All the while Anti-Fa and BLM continue to harass Whites on the streets as the do today.You can’t fight the cops, military, anti-Fa, and BLM all combined. But you can survive. Escape, evade, don’t end up in a camp. There its all over, you won’t be leaving it ever. Unless you are near death that’s the Chinese model.

            Trump may finally learn you can admire or even idolize the men in uniform, but he’s not one of them.  They will never respect him.  And at their level, they are merely bureaucrats and see him as an outsider to be stymied and subvertedWhich is why it is always better for men in politics who never served to treat — even if it’s just an act —  military men with an air of superiority.  Look dow on them to put them on the defensive.  Or they will take advantage.  As we can see with Trump.Obama and Clinton, much better politicians, understood this.   I know it’s hard for Trump to let go of his admiration for these military guys, but they are not real military guys and not heroes. They’re not Patton.  They weasels and bureaucrats and scum of the earth like Powell and Mattis.

        The people celebrating Biden think they will get reeducation camps and proscription lists, but instead they will end up with a less coherent version of Bush II.From your keyboard to whomever/whatever is in charge’s ears. I sincerely hope you’re correct. I’m too old to have to worry about ending up in a camp – I don’t reckon they can get ’em setup and running in 4 years and I would be utterly gob smacked if I live to vote in the next general election. But I have a son in his early 50s and a daughter about to hit 40 and if the camps come they’re the ones who’ll see them coming. My son also has 3 grown children and 3 grandchildren of his own and all are pure aryan stock so prime candidates for the camps.Z Man, I’d love to hear/read your reasoning for the above assertion. I figure Kameltoe is going to launch a 25th Amendment coup on Dopey/Gropey Joe as soon as practical. Would you be surprised to see someone like AOC as her choice to do a Jerry Ford? I’ve also heard rumors of Pelosi being deposed in favor of AOC. What are your thoughts.DOthe wackos have enough pull to swing something like that?those elites that are a permanent feature of all societies control public policy in a liberal democracy, just as they do in every other form of governmentI believe that the aforementioned elites consider dissidents of any sort to be a threat so why wouldn’t they allow the likes of us to be rounded up and “re-educated” to death? Really like to understand Z Man’s thinking on this.liberal democracy, without the brake of thermonuclear war, is a runaway train of partisan fury. Instead of disputes being settled at the ballot box, each election intensifies the dispute.The Left is united and unquestionably has the bit in its teeth. What’s toSTOPthem from fulfilling many of our worst fears? The only lever of power they do not control is SCOTUS and even that is but a single funeral away. Some of our AJs are getting rather long in the tooth and, well, shit happens; doesn’t it?

        You describe symptoms but not cause.  The cause is of course the growth of government influence into every aspect of everyone’s life.  Government is force, threats and intimidation.

        the bourgeois quest for objectivity and civics only made sense in the scarcity world, and/or aristocratic/hierarchical societies where the elites couldn’t legally be removed by vote, so they had to work hard not to be removed by guillotine. after the fall of hierarchy*, liberal democracy still did well for a while because the freemasons ran the show well under their “don’t upset the industrial-finance complex cart” doctrine; defeating trads/fashs and subsuming marxists as shock troops, to create a slavish neocon controlled right and a squishy neolib middle to fall back on. the majority of postwar western people would be in this middle, the kind that would believe in freedom and democracy and consumerist success for everyone.until of course post-scarcity and the ensuing degeneracy. the end of the Soviet threat made us hunt Serb/Somali/Afghan/Iraqi/Syrian/Libyan tribesmen, and allow men in dresses to raise children and read tales in libraries to them, while they are raised weaklings in pods, allergic not only to the environment but reality, and fed through fads into a chained materialist life.that said, coming from a low trust society, i’d let you know that boycotting the vote may work at times only if the people rejecting the charade are ready to defend their stance and not let themselves be governed by the thieves. (which is why i support Trump’s effort to prove the fraud and win, it’s some response at least.) even then, boycotting isn’t worth much in the long run, because the elites eventually figure they just need to be better armed than the populace in order to quell rebellions and implant “democracy”. granted, in my experience those elites usually had some foreign backing that helped the quelling, money elites the USA, intellectual elites USSR.then again, the CCP and Israel combine both and are the worst of both worlds, influencing the post-cold war age in similar ways. small example: CCP unleashed virus to defeat DJT, Israel releases the cure just in time to help Bush Lite. not even Russia is a dependable nationalist backer, while mostly okay they still have issues with us and themselves of course. so idk, maybe a boycott and revolt will happen eventually (how about a massive strike? it works for the left), but perhaps first the GOP must finish itself by allowing nevertrumpers and javankas to remain around. if and when Trump is abandoned, then the people may attempt a boycott and revolt, perhaps with the intermediate step of creating a third party that may succeed. still… considering the amount of institutional rigging, maybe in the long run separation is a clear possibility.*of course, the breakdown of aristocracy can happen. 1789 happened due to things going really swell for monarchical France for a while and then quite bad few decades before the revolution. sure, you had the hypocritical elite freemason ideologues, but without the hungry Parisians and bad harvests they wouldn’t have had legitimacy. again though, eventually post-scarcity revealed the charade.

            If you do not have Latin blood it may be a pain in the ass being around a lot of Italians and Spanish, and if you are a Nord there will be days when you feel alone.  Although all are Europeans, there are a lot of differences that northern whites/Europeans will  get frustrated with and vice versa.Here is something that I think speaks to a lot of the difference.   An Italian will look for the quickest way to finish a job so he can then relax and do nothing for the rest of the day.  Not that they cut corners, they just can focus for a few hours and learn as they go and complete the job.  Then they get to sit around and gab and maybe take a nap or sneak off early.  A Nord, on the other hand, will plan and plot his approach for a few hours and figure he has all day to complete the same task and go about it methodically and groan and gripe and make sure you hear how hard it all is so maybe you toss him a small bonus.I have been in this country for two generations and I STILL have problems with a lot of northern European whites who just take all damn day to do something.  So if it hasn’t been bred out me yet, safe to say it’s genetic disposition to a different outlook on life. And there you really have it.    Latins work to live, Nords live to work.   Sums it up and something one should contemplate if they plan on moving.
