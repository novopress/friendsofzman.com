        I love American Pit Bull Terriers. I have a degree in electronics engineering, a good job, &amp; a nice home in a rural area. If my neighbors’ parties disturb me, they’re really loud, for the sound to carry that far. Fortunately, my neighbors are considerate: neither they nor I hold loud parties (or shooting get-togethers) late at night. Sounds as if you just don’t like good dogs.Aside from the unreasonable canine bias, it’s an excellent post.

        Clearly, Singapore must be resting on some very, very special dirt in order to develop from a poor backwater in 1960 to a global trading and financial hub with a highly educated population and advanced infrastructure.
The people and leadership of Singapore has nothing to do with this. It would be interesting to transplant black Africans to Singapore so the they could get enriched by the magical Singaporean dirt. (Also, it’s really a terrible shame that the dirt in Africa is so non-magical, and that’s why Africa is poor.)

        […] I’ve visited this topic in the past, but it seems like a good time to catalog the various forms of magic floating around the Cult. As the load bearing walls of the ruling class show signs of distress, magical thinking is breaking out all over so keeping up on the latest spells and incantations is probably a good idea. That and it allows me to let my hair down and say horrible things about Progressives. […]

        “Magic Dirt Theory is what’s behind the push to export troublesome populations out to the suburbs. ”
More likely, what’s behind it is a profound dislike and disrespect toward the people traditionally living in the suburbs.  But Magic Dirt Theory provides good cover.

        I live in downstate Illinois, where magic dirt is plentiful.  We are getting our fair share of diversity, via Section 8 housing.  Eastern Illinois University is a hotbed of diversity, as you can tell from the increase in brawls and police calls.

        The fact that you can measure a society in fifths is probably itself a sign of health. I doubt that fifths would be of much use in Africa. Or Detroit.

        I love that the hot beds of not magic dirt are northeastern Arizona and northwestern New Mexico where the largest reservations are. Curious that.
Explanations are demanded!

        The only solution is to redouble efforts to transplant more blacks into places like Ferguson Missouri.
If our federal overlords can transplant blacks to the magical whitefields, the next step will be to transplant whites to Detroit, West Baltimore, and other vibrant black communities. The magic that attaches to them will remake the vibrant communities into citadels of order and achievement.

        You’ve forgotten the fact that the wizards and witches who distribute Magic Dirt must, however, be removed from it. If a wizard or witch (and upcoming in the States is a special ceremony to choose the next grand wizard or grander witch) resides on Magic Dirt they lose their powers to magically help all others. Thus the wizards and witches live in special secure places behind high walls where there is no Magic Dirt under their feet to taint them.
Thank goodness our super-duper wizards and witches know this!
