        Bill James (the baseball sabermetrics guy) put forth an ambitious prison reform scheme in his “Popular Crime” book.
Sailer discussed it here:http://isteve.blogspot.com/2011/07/bill-jamess-prison-reform-idea.html

        Robert Heinlein explores this concept nicely in his short story ‘Coventry’. It makes so much sense, especially for country as large as America, it is difficult to understand why we are not already doing it.  Thank you for bringing it up.

        Not a bad idea, really, but it would empty out lots of places, including, by your description, the area you live in. We’re already at the “Escape from New York”, “Escape from LA”, “Escape from Detroit”,”Escape from East St. Louis”, “Escape from 3rd Ward of Houston” (keep on indefinitely) stage. We’d need a good-size island. Madagascar-sized, or Zanzibar-sized, maybe.

        For the lifer population I have always advocated chemical restraint.  A simple implant, renewed when required, could reduce the violent element to a pastoral flock requiring little correctional supervision.  If they are indeed sociopaths,  and cannot help their violet proclivities then simple medication could relieve their and societies problems.  Why punish when you can sedate?

        Coincidence: I have long advocated the same on this side of the Atlantic, but for a slightly different reason.Britain has many partially or wholly deserted islands (and if Scotland stays in the Union, even more out in the Atlantic) which can be turned into a prison for the incorrigible. Like you said, supplies can be airlifted in and if they are given shelters (probably made of concrete) they can sort out their own society. Sure some may kill each other but unless they set up their own judicial system there will be no court case, nothing other than retribution from fellow inmates. Most importantly is there not likely to be a way off the island but a small patrol boat — or a minefield — can make sure nothing approaches.Inmates swimming to the mainland thirty miles away in the violent Atlantic is highly unlikely.So why is my reason different? We have thousands of muslim offenders in our jails here and while some may be reformed and rehabilitated you can absolutely guarantee the ones put inside for wanting to kill non-believers will never change. They may currently have a twenty year sentence because they think Allah wants them to commit some atrocity — never quite sure why an all-powerful deity can’t do it himself, but apparently can’t — but having been allowed all their rituals and well fed on their religion’s approved food they are just waiting to get out and finish the job they started.If they were on a rocky island they can either take up studying seagulls or find a quiet corner to pray. I’d even put a sign up showing which way to face, though they’d never know if they were actually in the right direction.They are, but the way, free at any time to go and meet Allah under their own steam.

        I guess Catalina could hold ’em. 13,500 per square mile would pack in a million there. That would leave over two thousand square feet for each critter, maybe a thousand after easements.
