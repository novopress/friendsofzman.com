        “LeeBong is not a dumb guy. He’s not a genius”Bill Simmons at ESPN.com would disagree with you there.  BS puts LBJ in the same BB genius category as MJ, Magic, and Bird.  Both of you do agree on why LBJ is leaving Miami for Cleveland, namely, his teammates on the Heat cannot play at the same high level of BB artistry as LBJ, which means he would not be contending for a third title if he had stayed in Miami.  That point is correct is as far as it goes, but doesn’t acknowledge the impact of the severe beat down the San Antonio Spurs laid on Miami in the championship.  Duncan &amp; Co. are going to be around for the next two or three years and strong contenders for the crown. LBJ knows the Spurs stand in the way of another Miami title, and so his choice in free agency came down to:  over the next two years, either (1) lose in Miami with teammates whose skills are deteriorating or (2) lose in Cleveland with a young team that can be built to fit his style of play and become a top contender after Duncan &amp; Co. retire.  The decision he made was the right one.  (Not that I’m biased by the fact that I went to school in Cleveland, but I say that for full disclosure.)
