        The fact that almost half of America has crossed the event horizon into gibbering psychosis is an invincible argument against the democratic process. What else could it be? The proposition that sanity and survival must be put on the line every four years is itself insane. If debating with the Left is pointless, then giving them the chance to retake control is something beyond that.

            Watched the State of the Union last night. Saw the ghetto congressman punch the air with his cane like a pimp. Saw the ghetto congresswoman Crockett call Trump a bitch and Putin’s ho. Recalled what it was like not 40 years ago in the US in terms of public decorum — even after the horrors of the hippies and the 1960s and 1970s cultural breakdown.I really struggle mentally with why a people would do this to themselves. Why the people aroundmewould, in fact. The still living. The ones who believe in this, who see nothing wrong with it. I look at them sometimes — those in their 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s — and wonder about the human exploit called “imagination,” and how they got these people to go along with their own replacement by 3rd worlders whom their grandparents once scorned in the pages of National Geographic. And how that exploit ruined the rest of the only existence I had, as I live out the rest of my life in the ruins of what those people created and will leave behind.

                Best of all, they handed us what is probably the greatest talking point of all time: They wouldn’t even clap for the cancer kid. Seriously, people — I understand you have Very Serious Concerns about Trump’s blah blah blah, but…. cancer kid. Whatever Very Important Point you thought you were making, the fact remains, you couldn’t even muster up the simple human dignity to clap for the cancer kid. Even Hitler himself, I would venture to say, would’ve clapped for the cancer kid.

                    Distasteful as they are, through various forms of rigging (census, redistricting, and plain ol ballot stuffing) they are probably going to regain control of the House next year. Maintaining an appearance of legitimacy. Be happy to be wrong. But the GOP should have a roughly 30 seat majority right now if not for those things.

                        Yep, they aren’t going away and in the long run there will be more of them and they will be back in control.  Trump/ Maga is a blip, not a correction.  I would love to be wrong.

                        I think we are going to see some “election integrity” moves later this year.  There’s a reason Biden pardoned James Clyburn – the guy who runs the vote rigging operations.

                    Best case scenario, we’ve bottomed out. Maybe. Maybe not, though. There’s no way to tell.
Either way, for those of us with more yesterdays than tomorrows, who’ve watched this get worse and worse for 30 years, we know we won’t see any restoration (which ain’t happening, but I’ll go along). There are simply too many of these people now. The audience of decent people for whom these displays are offensive is smaller and smaller by the year, and our voices less and less likely to ever be heard.

                    Indeed.
Few years back, one of the locals here had a son with brain cancer. Agony and endless operations.  Economically poor family.  The kid was ten years old.
I prayed to God for a resolution, any resolution that brought him relief and benefit.  A month or so later, he finally died.  His family was heartbroken, of course, but I was relieved.  Silently relieved.
The Left shows its inner desolation and malevolence by politicizing a kid with brain cancer.

                    Those SOTU shoutouts were very well done and intended to reinforce the point Trump made at the very beginning of his speech, “There is nothing I can say or do that will make them happy.”He then proceeded to prove his point.The Secret Service chief almost lost it when the kid hugged him.  That was a beautiful moment.But the best part came later when Trump said basically, “They said they needed a new law to control the border.  Turns out, we just needed a new President.”Genius.Trump took the fight to them, and the Democrats’ reaction is why that party – like the GOP – is on the verge of collapse.

                They’re too busy taking cruises and partying in ‘senior communities’ and chanting “Hands off MY SS/medicare gibs” to notice or care what their own solipsism and the depravations of homo erectus and the indios have done to their kids’ and grandkids’ quality of life.

                    Sadly, this is true of my own ‘Silent’ gen relatives, now in their late 80’s.
They get a pass with all the Boomer hate but the first, very first go-to is always with the “I” word. Could be a mention of the fucking Cicadas and it’s “well, I’m not a Cicada…” It’s almost a game now when we speak, this repetitive behavior.
They were egalitarians after all, and watched the bad shit happen to this country when I was 4 with “well, as long as it makes them happy” or “as long as it isn’t hurting anyone else” garbage.

                        This raises a very important anthropological question: why didn’t Trump succumb to madness?  His views really haven’t changed much since the age of the Yuppie even though his compatriots have mostly played the go-along-to-get-along game.  Why the intransigence on his part, and is it replicable?

                            There was an experiment long ago (IIRC) and often commented upon since.Fish school, but the phenomenon of “schooling” was poorly understood.  A researcher captured a fish from a school and operated on its brain such that they hoped it would no longer school.  To learn more of the phenomenon, they placed the fish back into the school, yet the deviant behavior was not noticed.  Why?  Well it turned out that all the “normal” fish now followed the “altered” fish.Some people just don’t school, but they do lead.  Trump is a deviant.  Surely a rare occurrence at best—perhaps even rarer that he survived outside the “school”, hidden in plain sight. We are only just recognizing the phenomenon he exemplifies.

                Yes. That was a terrible show. One side was all white other than their diversity props. It was elderly and male. The other side was largely non-white and white women in pink pant suits. They are much younger.The vulgarity, not a civilized vulgarity, but a savage’s vulgarity is increasingly in our future. Pimp canes and salon nails hos neck rolling and yelling and cussing in our August bodies.Of course, these hucksters and villains will also open the US to foreign predation.At the same time, young men have awakened. It isn’t over, but it is going to get very contentious and probably very ugly. Trump has to mass deport. NY schools are only 15% white. LA I believe is in similar territory. Not so long ago California was handily white and very quickly it is only 30%.

                    The schools my kids attended back in Collin County, Texas, are now 30% White – taken over by south and east Asians.  In places like Houston and San Antonio, it’s blacks and mestizos.  Demographics is destiny, and Merka no longer has one.

                        The Empire of Merka needs to die. We need to carve out a country of our own, and by constraints imposed by reality it will be smaller. So be it. Preserving European people is objective #1, not preserving land area. People are first, and water, energy and minerals are second.I told one of my wackjob relatives 3-4 years ago this was going to end in 200 million dead, not as a threat but as a prediction. He was stunned and said nothing in response but it was clear that he thought it lunacy. Now, he is visibly afraid, and I don’t mean a little bit.They thought they were building a better world, and now it is dawning on some that they have failed miserably.That’s what happens when you let the special people manage from offstage what you think is your project. The spotlight is on you when everything inevitably goes to hell. It is the fate of those incapable of transcending their bovinity who do not have betters of their own kind stampeding them towards the civilizational.More public feminine tantrums and African gibbering will hopefully move the center away from the worst of the crazies and increase the probability that the eventual solution which manifests will not be the worst case. Completely anecdotal of course, but comments and associated upvotes I have seen on sites of the some of the young youtube journalists support this. It’s not that people are turning towards Republicans, who are still every bit as much excrement as they have been since that monster Abraham Lincoln, but that Democrats have shown themselves unfit to rule.

                            This should be the daily drum beat from our kind: we want our own nation. There is simply no going back, and the sooner we urge more to get past the mental hurdle, the better. Most thought this unthinkable just a few years ago. Trump will just be an interregnum but will not stop the inevitable dissolution of the GAE. Trump will not be the one to take us there, but he will  be a transitional figure.

                            It was small to begin with, but with each expansion, we embraced more and more non-whites, from the Louisiana Purchase to the annexation of most of the Southwest from Mexico. Those are not white lands. For a time they were colonized (similar to Rhodesia, in a sense), but no longer, and they won’t be again. It’s time for us to pull up tents and come home. Wherever that will be.

                    Got a reality check the other day. My local medical group, now on its umpteenth, financialized ‘owner’ was undergoing the installation of a ‘new system.’ When I got there to check in, it was obvious that DEI is still going strong, an obvious black company. Not one non black to be seen. Also clearly from Chicago from what I could tell.Long line, so plenty of time to observe.One male, running the show — if you call him repeatedly telling the desk ladies … themselves 40-ish with: nose piercing; wrist tats…. “try turning your computer off then back on again.” Look of panic on his face.Another worker, female, just a look of wide-eyed confusion, tinged with fear trying to ‘help’ another work station.Nearby, the princess, you know the look: big mane of hair, loooong nails. Holding a clipboard, rude look on face. Otherwise doing nothing. Others, lesser lights by their reduced level of ‘presentation’ also standing around doing nothing.A lot of them. Doing nothing.The paunchy and mostly older whyte people, all friendly, “oh, it’s all right” or “I understand…” They are NOT rayciss I tell you.The result is ***days*** waiting for the RESULTS of an important test. Having to literally spend tons of phone time, go medieval … make appointment at another place in another town .. when doctor said my results would be in a few minutes. Minutes before THAT appoint, ‘manager’ calls with results. Doctor NEVER “called” or “texted” as promised.This is where DEI stepped into the ring to be spelled as “DIE.” Luckily, I did not do so.

                The absolute erasure and reconfiguration of the white mind is one of the most incredible phenomena in human history. The vast majority of white people, once full of perspicacity, vitality, virility and beauty, are now shambling gray drones with nose rings, tattoos and green hair. They have no critical faculties and no agency. They worship those (negroes/perverts) they are told to worship and despise their own people without demur. It is sad, it is infuriating, but more than that it is utterly dumbfounding.

                    I’m starting to believe that almost all whites would literally rather die out than be called racist for excluding non-whites and this can’t be changed.
I used to believe that whites are like this due to incessant media conditioning, but I’m starting to worry that it is worse than that.
Even the most rebellious figures on the right must show that they love non-whites, like Trump with that black muslim kid in the SOTU.
I’m starting to believe that my people are mostly an incurable suicide cult.  I don’t know how this happened.

                        Whites seemingly have a genetic predisposition for pathological altruism. Scandinavians have the worst case of it, and Eastern European/Mediterranean peoples somewhat less so. As far as I know that defect/mutation has not been isolated and identified but it almost certainly exists.

                                    That would be a lot of elaboration, Ostei.  I’ve written so many essays on the occult and deep-deep state ritual of that murder that I’ve lost track.  Many years ago.
It wasn’t the breaking of American innocence, it was a full-on national rape.  Right in front of everybody, so there would be no doubt who was in charge.
Don’t really want to go over it all again.  No offense intended.

                        Line…..believe this is hard wired behavior. This is Ed Dutton territory in his musings about Human BioDiversity. Our slow life living strategy evolution of living in cold climate, often indoors in winter, and having to get along within the tribe or you get kicked out into the snow to die. The Fast Life Living folks can punch each other out like the chimps then run away. That doesn’t explain the 30 Years War for the Slow Lifes though.We are what we eat. Look around at all the obesity and terrible health. Only getting worse. Yesterday, my son-in-law was diagnosed with brain cancer and lung cancer at 56. Jesus! So painful to watch. Still 2 packs of cigarettes a day, and massive dogshit for food filling an endless black hole that even Cern and the Large Hadron Collider couldn’t tackle. When one self destructs with food-smokes and so on, that’s a choice and not a thing anyone else can say or do to alter that course. They get determined and dig in. Wally World keeps on expanding as it devours Western Civ.Best to you, Line.

                        I used to believe that whites are like this due to incessant media conditioningI still believe so, having lived through the Norman Lear (and his imitators) era. And don’t forget the hundreds of “Smart Black/Stupid White” TV commercials we were subjected to over the years. Plus, the national news mediastillwon’t report on violent black-on-white crime when it occurs. This sort of thing definitely has some sort of subliminal psychological effect on its intended target.

                    Most people are naturally followers, so it’s vital that elites lead them in a productive and benign direction. People were probably the same in the 1950s but followed social cues to get married before kids, keep a neat lawn etc. Now the TV tells them to be slovenly and select weird pronouns.

            The US has been heading toward a leftist apocalypse since Lincoln, a minority President, trashed the Constitution and ruled by martial law…Lincoln emulators Woodrow Wilson and FDR pushed the US further and further left, constantly expanding Federal power with help from a leftist Supreme Court, and ending with Obama’s rule making whites a discriminated against minority…But this didn’t happen in a vacuum, it was enabled by the votes of women, as more and more States and ultimately a Constitutional amendment, gave them the franchise…But the Democrats blundered by openly attacking the family, which peeled off some of the female vote, so the 1990s liberal Democrat Donald Trump was elected….The problem is that most women still want to give everything to everybody, whatever the cost, and many think it’s “mean” to deprive Federal workers, or incompetent or malignant teachers, of their no-work jobs…The US cannot survive by pandering to such emotions, which are antithetic to restoring America’s educational system and work ethic, and appointments of people like Pam Bondi do not inspire faith in Trump’s willingness to do what’s necessary….

                I think you’ve hit upon the key as to why “Western” (e.g. Caucasian) society has gone soft — feminization. Women are by and large the way you characterized them. It’s probably simply their biological nature. Now that they are equal partners with men in power, indeed outnumber them some places (e.g. HR or the university), is it any wonder that the remaining men “allowed” to work alongside them will tend to be selected for feminine, passive traits?This problem is only going to get worse until some crisis or series of crises reawaken the ancient wisdom and we will learn, the hard way, why in the olden times women weren’t allowed anywhere near positions of real power where they might have to make difficult decisions and be “mean” to others or, God forbid, do stuff that might make them less popular with the other women. Real men will put the women in their place. It remains to be seen what the racial make-up of those men will be.

                “Egregore”“a non-physical entity or thoughtform that arises from the collective thoughts and emotions of a distinct group of individuals.”
Can verify, yes, and yes, and yes again, but I have far too much to say here and cannot talk about it. I wanted to thank you for bringing up the concept to this group’s attention. A medicine man introduced me to this vital clue many years ago when he told me the Indians call such an “oversoul.”
It is an influence, a driver even, but discussion of the physical and mundane is more practical at this time.

            I’m impressed that only about half of Americans are propaganda zombies.Our Democracy is a 24/7 four-walledshow of unanimity / demand for obedience, yet the statistically typical American pretty much totally blows it off. That’s why he’s being “replaced.”Even in our media-degraded state, an America governed by average American opinion would be a utopia—compared to what we have. Democracy demands relentless brainwashing, psy-ops, lies, and corruptionbecausenormal people aren’t evil and stupid enough to please our masters. If they even slightly submitted to popular will,everythingwould be different.Trump merely accepts the idea in principle—that the people should be represented, or at least notalwaysthwarted and beaten—and look how they react.

        The period from 1938 to 1968 was essentially the Third American Revolution, after the first two revolutions 1776 and 1865. The government finally slipped the constitutional leash of limited and enumerated powers, and created a welfare/warfare Leviathan for which anything and everything was justified in the name of “democracy,” “civil rights,” “social security,” and so on. The Four Freedoms replaced the Bill of Rights — Roosevelt specifically stated that the Four Freedoms should be available “everywhere in the world,” thereby launching the Global American Empire on an endless and impossible quest to stamp out “Fear” and “Want” “everywhere in the World.”How is this not as grandiose and ambitious as Marx’s communism?You have to admit those were heady times for the Progressives. They enjoyed unlimited power — bureaucratic lawmaking without Congress, war anywhere in the world without a congressional declaration, trampling over property rights and speech rights and freedom of assembly in the name of “civil rights.” And there was basically NO opposition.Hell, Eisenhower forced integration on Little Rock with active-duty troops with bayonets fixed. Only the “bigots” and “racists” complained.No wonder the Progressives are constantly reliving the past. For them, it was glorious.The problem is that the government is now broke and the nation is $36 trillion in debt and overburdened with progressive busybodies and Karens. It can’t afford this nonsense any more. And the GAE has become the oppressor it previously decried instead of the “liberator.”There HAS to be a reckoning. The GAE has to collapse.Trump is just the beginning of the process.

            The old order became too corrupt, senescent, spoiled, and genocidal to bear, so more capable elites see this as their chance to usurp the current rulers.
It’s the ‘3 generations from rags to riches’ problem, thus, the 4th turning.As Saml said, once the grandkids have become a cargo cult, trying to run things as if they were still in a past that no longer exists, opportunities open up for the ambitious.
Allowing our past history and current guidelines to be rewritten based on the deranged fantasies of parasitic symbiotes makes that cargo cult even more unworkable.

                And, yet, the cargo cult persists into the next generation and beyond. I doubt there are 5% who can explain why Chesterton’s Fence is where it is in just his own worldview, instead, relying onpost hocfallacies and the fig leaf of “tradition”.
This is bad. Traditions evolved for a different culture, a different people. We know traditions won’t work with the current demographic, and without a realistic means of changing the demographic, we can’t just cargo cult our way through it.

        There is a practical side to progressives living in the past while dreaming of the future.Normies have already been sold on the idea that Nazis, Jim Crow and black slavery were the worst things to have ever happened. Since leftist women, Jews and soy boys love hysteria, it is an easy way to energize the troops.Focusing on those agreed upon evils has worked to silence opposition and provides great cover for the left’s carrying water for wealthy globalists now.White men were in charge during those evil times so now that they are working on making real the dream of ethnically and gender cleansing of white men from power, they can invision how Paradise is just around the corner.America isn’t the country of non whites and Jews so they have no emotional connections to its history and no desire to honor it or the culture. Mongolians still honor Genghis Khan because they are still Mongolians. Turks still honor the Ottoman Empire because they are still Turks. However, America and Europe are increasingly filled with paperwork citizens so they see themselves as benefiting from demonizing the past of the people from whom they are stealing their future. They become heros instead of grifters

        Today’s progressives are malignant narcissists. The problem for them is that they suddenly are easily ignored and dismissed, and, worst of all from their perspective, boring, dreary and uninteresting. The last bit is particularly painful for a narcissist. The “Right” is actually exercising power for the first time in our lifetimes, and we understandably train our focus there, but from the perspective of the progressive, the marginalization is the worst aspect. Extreme violence certainly is possible as they fade into dreary irrelevance, but they also are prone to curl into the fetal position if their clanking of pans doesn’t get attention. For the time being they will silo and try to regroup, but so far the latter doesn’t appear that is in the cards for them. Self-immolation may be their only way to attract attention, and even then it might not. Cowardly conservatives certainly want to help them out, but even they find it a lift.

            That’s the thing that is driving the Democrats insane right now. Trump and his movement have become fashionable, and the Left have become politically and culturally unfashionable, as well as personally repellent. For years, the Left has also banked on their Vichy “opponents” being as void of likable human characteristics as they are. That is no longer the case.
For years, the Left has been attempting to forge a cult of personality around leaders with none. Last night Trump showed that he still has that charisma and it eats them with hatred.

                I noticed this a few years ago. Leftism became horribly uncool and the place for bossy scolds and obnoxious black women. Imagine being a young zoomer going to school and your teacher put up pride flags everywhere. Who wants to be a leftist? It doesn’t even get you chicks anymore. Democrats have nothing to offer men in general but especially White men. We saw that with Kamala where she said she would help black guys get weed and welfare. it was hilarious but no surprise black guys had no interest. Conservacucks are horribly lame, make no mistake. But Andrew Tate drives fast cars and bangs hot chicks. Of course some leftists saw this dynamic taking shape, but really had nothing to offer in counter but… censoring Andrew Tate. Which made him more popular with zoomer boys. They’re totally clueless.

                    Yes. And our side is ready to take the next step to being truly cool. We are going to repudiate the pimp Andrew Tate and his ilk. We are going to reclaim ourselves and our women by being willing and able to physically confront and dominate pimps and porn hawkers like Tate and beat them to the margins.That Tate is cool is a sign of just how degraded and negrified this civilization in death convulsions is. Tate is at the bar buying friends but he isn’t long for being thrown out on his ass.That is where this is headed. White men growing back up and looking to themselves for the standard. The future is Thomas Rousseau and the men rallying to the banner of manhood and someday they will make pimps and stray dogs like Tate live on the margins again.

Leftism became horribly uncool and the place for bossy scolds and obnoxious black women.The Left still thinks itself the “Cool 😎, hip, and free” kids “Fighting The Man!” when instead they areThe Manand are acting accordingly.(Or maybe they’re The Woman given how much they scold, hector, and shriek at everyone and everything. Dunno, posters here can noodle it out)Who wants to be a leftist? It doesn’t even get you chicks anymore. Democrats have nothing to offer men in general but especially White men.That’s the thing. The Left used to be “Sex, Drugs, and Rock-n-Roll!” but now:#MeTooDrugs are bad (Except Mary Jane)Rock-n-Roll is replaced by RapAnd men are evil.Guys get the message. Some “Tune out, turn off, and drop out” to repurpose a phrase from Timothy Leary but others rebel by becoming more conservative and much more sarcastic.Of course some leftists saw this dynamic taking shape . . . They’re totally clueless“We are so NOT! We’re the Cool Kids! Don’t you want to be one of us?”“Nope.”Screaming, wailing, and yelling commence.﻿

        The obsession with 1938 and 1968 reflects the Jewish control of American culture and political discourse. The crusade against Hitler (who was no threat to the USA) but was a threat to Jews and their Great Socialist Motherland (the USSR)  and the civil rights movement, which removed the last barriers to Jewish control of the USA, are the great lodestars of the Jewish mind. Every threat to Jewish control is a new Hitler, every attempt to end discrimination against white gentiles or oppose perversion means the KKK is on the march. No opposition to the Jewish agenda is tolerated. Even a blatant Judaeophile like Donald Trump is really just 𝘋𝘦𝘳 𝘍ü𝘩𝘳𝘦𝘳 in a three piece suit. Their lapdogs in the media (most of which they own) and politics (most of whom they finance) repeat this idiocy like Charlie McCarthy.

        It’s not just the loss of the Christian framework. It’s also just the loss of any personal connection to those past dates. A 25-year-old was born 30+ years after 1968. What resonance does that have to him or her. The story is too distant for them to put themselves into it. (Some young blacks and Jews still try, but even they are stretching it.)
As to the 1938, it might as well be 1066 for all they care.

            It connects with the overall prosperity of the west post-WW II. Anyone who was born and grew up post 1946 has no living memory oftrulyhard times. This effect gets stronger the more recent the birth.The generation that lived through WW I, and then the Great Depression, seemed to have the sense to keep some “guard rails” on societal impulses, because they damn wellknewwhat hard times were and didn’t want to create conditions that could recreate them. Those generations are gone now. Even the WW II vets are nearly gone. The following generations have torn down every societal Chesterton Fence they see, because why not? It doesn’t harm them. They’ve still got full bellies and warm homes and have no conception that these things could ever disappear or even be threatened.AKA “good times create weak men.”

                Are there any more than a few WW2 vets even living?  This August will be 80 years since VJ Day.  Even if they signed up at 17 in 1945, that would make them 97 years old.  Even those alive would be in their homes or assisted living in their wheelchairs.  Even most of the silent generation are gone.  They were kids in the great depression.Both of these generations failed in their duties to the next generation, the Boomers.  They allowed the progressives to take over the schools and melt the minds of the kids who grew up into self-righteous SJWs who support every progressive cause.

                    IIRC the last WWI veteran died in the early 2000s, so just over 80 years from the end of that war. So we can expect the final WWII veteran to leave this plane of existence within the next 5 years. 10, tops.And yes, there are only a sliver of WWII vets left, who must all be pushing or past 100. As a child in the 1980s, it felt like they were everywhere growing up. I knew of at least two just in my little rural stretch of nowhere-special-ville. It’s .. sobering? To have lived long enough now that they’re almost all gone.

The wars were still fresh in everyone’s minds in the Fifties and early Sixties.  Men were heroes, dads were loved and respected.  That was before the Feminist Movement really got its teeth in the nuclear family.

There were always a stream of old guys (IOW, not Vietnam vets) going in and out of them, many of them in uniform or part of a uniform.  By the 90s they were mostly all gone.

            For a long time already, WW2 has been books and movies about WW2. Young people don’t watch those movies but they’ve seen them advertised and referenced and ranked. They know what the music in them sounds like. They don’t read any books, but they see book jackets in aspirational lifestyle pics. They know which titles match which class of person.It’s the hollow core of the myth that lets it resonate. No one now living knows much of anything about Hitler.Everythingsays he’s here and he’s you—and defeating him is the only morality. If he were real, as he briefly threatened to become for that short time when kids on TikTok could see films of his speeches, there’d be only a dull thud. “Hm. Interesting.”

        “Every Progressive, whether of the fast or slow variety, is a version of Blanche DuBois, saddling the next generations with themselves and their stories of the past.”
﻿Yes. Also like Blanche DuBois, they depend on the kindness of strangers. Someone else always has to pay for their dreams.

        It’s not that “progressivism” lacks a vision for the future. It very much has one, in a general sense, perhaps ill defined around the edges. Their problem is that, despite all the rigging, they still need a baseline number of votes to make it happen. And their vision of brown replacement + degeneracy isn’t a winning platform for getting them. Yet. Because it’s not far enough along. So they do have a vision, they just can’t tell you what it is. They have to pretend they want something else. These rallying cries to the standards of a glorious past are a necessary part of that deception.

            Whoever advises the progressives, i.e., finances them and tell them how to spend the money, omitted the part about it taking a long time. Given progressives are impulsive and are now horrified to learn they are dull as dishwasher, they are in total disarray. They may have a vision but the time and space reality are a real problem for them.

        I wonder if the ongoing stovepiping of Social Media might solve, or at least amelioriate, that problem. I enjoy reading the Leftist fever swamp sites like Salon from time to time, and they have an elaborate “delusion architecture,” as I think the shrink jargon has it. It’s this entirely self-referential world — all their articles are dripping with hyperlinks, but they only ever go to other articles on their site (or a few on likeminded sites). It’s hilariously cattywampus to reality, but it seems to work for them. The problem is that the Democrats actually listen to these people, but what if they wise up and realize that a) they’ve got their votes no matter what, and b) it doesn’t really matter, because there aren’t too many of them anyway? The Massively Online can continue their folie-a-deux pretty much indefinitely, in a sort of voluntary asylum, on BlueSky etc. Blanche DuBois, Miss Havisham, whatever, so long as she volunteers to stay locked in her attic, who cares?

I don’t know how you can stomach it, my friend.  Maybe it’s my lack of intellectual capacity or my raging hatred of these mutants that clouds my ability to even glance at their trash.  Kudos to you for being able to do it.

            I know that “true believer vs. cynical opportunist” is often debated when it comes to the other side, but I think the debate is over. The Democrats don’t listen to these people because they have to. They’re under the same delusion architecture. That should have been made obvious the past few years, especially with Project Ukraine. Look at how the Democrats behaved during the speech last night. Look at that forum that CNN hosted a month or two ago. They’re all the same. They believe in the things they say.I don’t know how you make a true believer stop believing. It usually takes some sort of catastrophic event, but the entire system is built around them not facing the consequences of their own decisions. And it’s clear now, six weeks into his term, that Trump’s existence and now refocused and energized these mutants. The difference between now and 2017 is that the elites don’t seem as interested in playing along with them.

                Yeah, they’re crazy. But that might end up being what the various social media silos are for — a sort of Choose Your Own Asylum. I also believe that in the fulness of time, whatever real public heath service that replaces the CDC will do a study, and find that these people are giving themselves what amounts to PTSD via their constant online outrage. The stress chemicals never get a chance to flush, so they get addicted to cortisol; I bet it has a hallucinogenic effect at a certain saturation level.

                    There appears to be one Democratic Congressperson who is not on board with the current Democratic obsession with the deplorable 𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘵𝘶𝘴 𝘲𝘶𝘰. He’s a guy named Ro Khanna who represents Silicon Valley. He’s basically been saying that it’s not enough to be against DT. If you are seen as advocating the policies that have got us into this mess, you will lose. I think he’s pissing into the wind and the current Democratic Party is too afflicted with TDS to heed any such advice. They appear to think Trump will self-destruct and they need only sit back and watch it happen.

                            That was Roe Conn, and pretty sure not. He did set off a lot of alarms in people, though, with his constant reminders that his mother was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. That’s where Con, Inc in the blue hives lives. And a lot of people realized that was not the direction they wanted America to head.

                Nah, it’s a business. Every Dem in the audience made $20mm minimum during the Biden-sponsored Treasury looting. So they put on a theatrical performance for the suckers last night. Clearly there are “true believers”, but few are in on the big grift. The true believers are at home watching. It really has become pro wrestling. That fraud Mike Johnson was nodding like a bobblehead as Trump listed the grifts while we all know he passed every one of those bills without a peep about USAID. I was hoping the pimp with the cane would rush the podium.

Probably not, but Gavin has no future in the Democrat Party.

                ‘but the entire system is built around them not facing the consequences of their own decisions’
The system, or sistem if you will, is female-populated and feminist-driven.  America infantilizes and disney-princessifies its females.  They are the sacrosanct sex, the consequence-free sex and that is exactly why they have done, and will do, so much malevolent damage.
Daddums will stomp every male on the planet down, but he just cannot punish Ims Pwincess.  Enough decades of that, you get New Amerika and all her prog-nation allies.

                    These days I’m often reminded of that line given to the successful but grumpy writer of romance novels played by Jack Nicholson in “As Good As It Gets”.  When asked by a fan why he was so good at writing female characters,  he said it was easy.  He just left out reason and accountability.

            I agree that the left-liberal ecosystem is more cloistered. The New Righters and Dissident Righters have more interesting debates, I’m pretty sure, and they live in the real world, pretty much, but I couldn’t tell you if the left-liberals have their own version of Hanania and Fuentes and Tucker and Zman, plus funny side acts like Drukpa and Perry Abbasi. I would think not. I used to be a left-liberal, and they have debates and personalities, even humor, but their online sphere very much resembles what we’d call boomer civnat vibe, except they like Democrats not Republicans.Although I am a little wary of the Trump adoration coming from the New Right. Last night, for example, the personalities I follow on X were fawning over their God Emperor the same way as CCP cadres do after Xi Jinping speeches. I’m sure all the boomer civnat personalities are all aflutter this morning, and pointing and sputtering at the Dems who didn’t clap for the newest Secret Service agent. I didn’t care for that corny shit either.

                I’ve wondered about that myself. The “Right” seems to organize its ecosystem on the gatekeeper principle — “this far and no farther!” The most disgusting, flag-sucking, Toby Keith-listening Grillers and Normies go no farther than, I guess, Hannity. A little farther and you’ve got Hanania,a little farther and you’re at Ben Shapiro, a little farther and you’re at Breitbart or whatever. Still light years from us, but there’s a continuum. (I don’t know where any given gatekeeper is on the continuum; it’s just for illustration. I don’t read any of these clowns — why bother?).I kinda doubt the Left does that. I can’t help Noticing there are no Liberals around anymore, for instance. They used to exist. It was possible to be friends with a Liberal, because he was (or could be) a basically decent person with goofball beliefs about various things, and while “a Liberal __” was always a Liberal first and a __ second, it was usually a close second. I think those people were the Left’s equivalent to Grillers and Normies, and they all got boiled off when the Left went utterly insane in the W. years. A lot of them probably actuallybecameGrillers and Normies; the rest let their freak flags fly and became standard-issue insane Leftists.Is there some kind of continuum of insanity? Is, say, Bill Maher less insane than Rachel Maddow? I don’t think insanity works like that, so I don’t think they can have a gatekeeper-type ecosystem. They just have different shticks, I guess — Maher’s shtick is “Hollywood Leftist” or whatever, whereas Salon.com’s shtick is “the faculty lounge of the drama department at a lousy community college.”

                    Good point, I don’t think left-liberals have the gatekeeping the right-liberals do. I guess their wingnut opposite to our neo-Nazis are their transexual pedophiles. (I am not making a moral equivalence here…just pointing out the most offensive wings of the spectrum.)I know there are quite a few left-liberals that dislike the perverted stuff, but the official Left has little problem with it. The official Right, on the other hand, will with great prejudice disavow and denounce wingnuts, and really anyone that is okay with being rude to the other side, up to and including civnat grillers like J6ers and the Proud Boys.As for Liberals in general, they are still around, but are centrists with a slight left or right bias, with the biases based on a 1992 worldview. That’s why a lot of right-leaning Republican voter dads I knew growing up, and a lot of 1990s Gen X teenage libertarians, are now anti-Trump.

            It’s not just the 2nd tier sites like Salon.  You can read the same trash in every major news outlet in the English language.  It’s all propaganda or corporate press releases and all in the same forms. It doesn’t really matter what the subject is either.  It’s as if they have been deliberately trained to write propaganda and are incapable of writing anything else.You would think a subject like the nation’s infrastructure would be fairly straight forward to write about.  The Association of Civil Engineers give us like a D grade every year.  But they just are incapable of writing sensibly about it and informing the public.  Instead we get articles about how infrastructure is racist or homophobic or how we need more women in infrastructure projects.

                That’s the other reason I read Salon, frankly — intel. The philosopher David Stove once said that there are certain philosophers who are worth reading only because they make important mistakesclearly. Salon is like that — literally everyone on the Left believes the same stupid, insane shit they do, but they are so dumb and slapdash that they’re always saying the quiet part out loud. It can be very informative.

            I’m a reader of Sev and like him, I sometimes browseSalon. I’m grateful to let Sev risk lowering his own IQ and just read his commentary on their latest drivel. However, I did read a long article about travel guru Rich Steves. I probably wouldn’t have, but in the 1990s I’d seen some of his PBS travel series (still on) and more importantly, heard him speak at a travel event in early 90s where I bought a few of his books and even had him autograph them. While that apparently didn’t make them valuable enough that they weren’t tossed out years later when I thinned out my library, they helped plan two enjoyable European holidays. Steves definitely knew his stuff. Anyway, I’d had no reason to think about him since 1990s; my idle curiosity got the better of me so I read his story. His company has been extremely successful. Steves is now nearly 70, married, kids, divorced, and recently had a bout of cancer.SalonbeingSalonof course they dwell on Steves’s politics and by their account, he is a prototypical Liberal, the real thing, not a shitllib apparently. Readers who are fans of Steves may enjoy the article, but must be forewarned that progressive politics are discussed. There are sparks* of humor there, like Steve asking what’s wrong if, after a hard day’s work, he comes home, gets stoned and stares at the fireplace for three hours?Interestingly, Steves is of Norwegian ancestry; what was said earlier about pathological altruism rings very true with Steve’s expressed beliefs.https://www.salon.com/2025/02/28/rick-steves-wants-to-radicalize-you/*Probably a seed exploding in the joint

        This moral framework is so powerful that they were unable to notice the irony of the Ukrainians using German tanks to attack the Russians in the Kursk region.A failed armored attack in Kursk? Well I never expected that!(First time as tragedy, second time as farce, eh?)This obsession over 1938 and 1968 is not just a way to solve the pointlessness of Progressivism, but also a way to escape present realityYou get the mindset of the people in power who lived through 1936 – 1939, but that’s a hard thing to square with people (like ourselves) who lived through 1989 – 1991. I mean, I’m not so naive to not understand why Our Government roams around looking for the next Austrian Mustache Man (we have lots of weapons programs that bring in lots of cash for connected people) but it’s obvious we’ve been playing our little “F-ck – F-ck Games” (Hat Tip Severian at Founding Questions for that phrase) to give our spooks and our troops something to do. Expend those weapons to buy more.Give Trump his due, cutting the money supply may cut this urge to roam around the world kicking asses and breaking stuff. Or not.

        BTW, Christianity is more than just “Pie in the Sky, in the Sweet By-and-By”, it is the key to the worthwhile, virtuous life here-and-now. Our cultural overlords understand this and have tried with might and main to pervert the morals of Joe and Josephine Average, with considerable success. Want to give these folks the metaphorical finger? Live a virtuous life. It is the ultimate rebellion.

        I would humbly suggest one more year to add: 1868.  The post civil war period was the second founding of the country, in which the sophisticated northerners came to rule over the hillbilly southerners, for their own good of course.  This was on display during the SNL 50th anniversary a few weeks ago, with Tom Hanks playing a hick MAGA supporter.  This is how northern progressives have seen the other half of the country for the last century and a half.  The year 1968 was a bookend to 1868, and we could all finally be equal.  Now the only thing keeping us from the promised land is reality, so they have tied themselves into evermore ridiculous knots trying to pull off the impossible.

            Hanks is a great example of what I was talking about in my post. He knew all along what part he was playing in the masquerade, the pretending he was doing. Now in his later years, he’s less shy about taking that mask off.

                Hanks, for some reason, always gave off a creepy vibe to me. It was like he was hiding a sewer beneath that nice guy cover he always tried to maintain. Plus he seemed insincere and not quite human. He ruined Private Ryan, an otherwise not really accurate but serviceable WW II movie because he was vain enough to not realize he was about 20 years too old and looked it, for his part.

That show was about a pair of male roommates who cross-dressed as women so they could live in a dirt cheap women’s only hotel.
Yep, sounds like a totally normal show to me.

        “The source of their rage is their spiritual death, which they cannot comprehend.”
Talk about distilling matters to their essence! That single line succinctly captures much of the problem in this cushy but frustrated (and frustrating) age.
Zman’s last couple of essays have been exceptional — even by the daunting standard he set for himself long ago. Really outstanding material!

        ‘This void is filled with anger, which is why they have become so vicious in defense of the absurd.

They fill the void inside left by their rejection and hatred of (that evil mean patriarchal) God and His Scripture as guide in life.  God the FATHER is replaced with their self-serving ideology, and it ain’t no coincidence that feminism is the leading entrenchment and profitable delusion.  Amerika is a nation saturated by the occult, and by goddess-reversion ideo-politics.Amerika wants its Mommy!

        We sure spend a lot of time relitigating the past while complaining about Progressives living in the past.When we do this we cede the moral argument that the past is where the future is found.I’d really like to know what comes next.  We all seem so certain that it’s the black pill scenario and it is unavoidable. But 5 years ago it was a certainty that an idiot like Joe Biden could never be elected President.  And 1 year ago Trump was heading for certain defeat and prison and not necessarily in that order.Is it possible to rewire an entire economy and the managerial state in 2 years?  And what might that look like?

        Hitler and Jim Crow are just crying wolf. The people in the elite who constantly cried those names were knowingly yelling Wolf! Wolf! Wolf! into the shepherder’s village. But the shepherders were fat and rich and indolent. They didn’t need their sheep anymore so what did they care? Well, the spiritually healthy of them cared a great deal. They have real morals and a spirit that is strong so that it is the one that created the spiritual/moral complex of Occidental man’s long and rich spiritual traditions – both Christian and pre-Christian.But the dumbtards you speak of believe it. They have to believe it. They have to because their project has done so much damage, its results a full inversion of the good they promised. Of course, their livelihood depends upon doubling, tripling … … down. We all knew this, but DOGE is scratching beneath the surface.What to do with them? Their demonic leaders and cynical criers of wolf must be punished. Mayorkas, BLM, FBI/Garfinkle, Schumer, Obama, C.Q Brown, Milley, Goldfein, … … … They must all &lt;fed post&gt;.The strivers are going to jump ship. Given how far they went with the Biden/Obama/Pritzker regime (in opposite order), they will go even farther with us. They only want to hold their drink at the fancy party and brag about their surgery schedule and their kids college admissions prospects. If it became the cause of power to send every last Regime commissar to a guillotine, the Strivers would be all for it the way they were all for White genocide and child castration. They must be shamed subtly over time. They will rabidly cheer the rightful demise of Mayorkas.Then there are the armies of the faithful. What do we do with them? Ruthless destruction of their financial networks. Repudiation of their credentials. Force them into the open labor market. Turn them into rabid advocates for mass deportation. Then let them pick lettuce, clean slaughterhouses and blow leaves.Finally, bring back the old ways and understandings of free speech, free expression, and treason. Bring back the old ways of punishing these things. It is simple really. First, they will be put to good use. Maybe some will start to feel better about themselves by being of use. For those that don’t, harsh consequences for subversion and childish heckling that en masse destroys a civilization will keep them in line.There is no way back to 1990. There is only a way forward that includes reconstitution of our ancient understanding and application of creating and maintaining order.

A week ago on this page I got told I was Stalin for saying the same thing.  Heck I was Literally Stalin(!!) for suggesting distasteful consequences for doing evil.
‘What to do with them? Their demonic leaders and cynical criers of wolf must be punished.’
Otherwise, all this Trump and dissident stuff is just a loud fart.  It’ll distract the enemy for a moment, then they’ll be right back at it like nothing happened.  Because it didn’t.

            Nice points but I think this all assumes we can stay within the current arrangement, but just get better management. I agree there is no return to the past, and those who have perpetuated this destruction on us must not only be stopped but punished, but I don’t think we will be able to fix the crazies. They are too far gone. The crazies, plus the foreigners and the current demographic trajectory mean we have to forge a new nation. I simply don’t view these others as my people, they are not and never will be. Enough is enough.

        For some time I noticed I tended to refer to similar particular years in my (reading/film-watching) interests: 1936-38 for pulp adventures, 1957 for atomic age sci-fi and horror, 1986 for comic books, maybe 1968 for counter-culture. While these years may not be the actual ‘high points’ of their cultural markers they are what I always think of.  Perhaps it is just a function of my particular age.

            ’68 was the peak of the worldwide “student revolution” (boomers demanding early inheritance of regime institutions) that still deforms the politics of the West, especially in America and France.
The Sixties™ were prepared earlier by MKUltra, Operation Mockingbird, the Port Huron Statement, etc., but they took a few years to show up on TV.

        If the point of the ideology is more of the same, then why bother?
Reminds of a theme that I see on ‘X’ where a leftist gloats about some economic number going down with critics noting that if “number goes up” means more of what Biden was doing then it’d be better if it went down.

        Fantastic essay –as per youghe– but alas, there is this line:Live a Christian life and your reward is eternal life at the feet of God.Poor choice of words: believers (those of us of the mystic/trancendential variety, at any rate) don’t do “reward ‘at the feet’ of a benevolent master;” rather, there is an issue of communion outside the limitations of time and physical reality…heaven isn’t a place, it’s a “state.”(Alas, my experience is that trying to communicate this to a materialist is like trying to point out the unique timbre of musical instrument to someone with a damaged cochlea…;- )‘Tevs – great essay!

        I have a theory and it has to do with that old adage about how much trouble a lawyer without any other cases can cause with the one case he does have (because he has nothing better to occupy his day with). My theory is that so much of domestic government is on autopilot and the executive branch really has no control over it, that the president is basically cucked. There is nothing for him to do all day, so that’s why we end up mucking around in the world and causing so much trouble.
