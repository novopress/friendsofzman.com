        “…..Southerners will stop apologizing for slavery”.Real Southerners are not apologizing as it was over a long time ago; we’re still being punished by the Yankees.

        America is far from being broke. Japan will likely default before we do. That’s what’s kinda frustrating to many who want collapse and reset so society is changed. It may be awhile

            We’ll never be broke because our treasure is our people.  Those who are capable and courageous come here from around the world to be free!   American ingenuity and know how is unbeatable.

        “Maybe the Germans will stop apologizing for Hitler and Southerners will stop apologizing for slavery.”I never thought to compare the two, but now that you mention it the light goes on. People stumble along in a daze until reality clouts them in the ear.“Over and over again I have said that there is no way out of the present impasse. If we were wide awake we would be instantly struck by the horrors which surround us … We would drop our tools, quit our jobs, deny our obligations, pay no taxes, observe no laws, and so on. Could the man or woman who is thoroughly awakened possibly do the crazy things which are now expected of him or her every moment of the day?”  – Henry MillerWhen either of those two sizable groups becomes fully awake and stops apologizing there will be hell to pay. But you are right, it will clear the decks.

        One additional wrinkle: history isn’t just a collection of solutions to past problems. It’s also a collection of solutions to what people thought, sometimes erroneously, their problems were.

        I reject the notion of “random walk” because I’ve looked at the nifty correlation between Elliott’s Wave Principle “pattern,” the stock market and the larger-scale social events of history.People herd. The compulsion to do so arises from brain structures whose output occurs BEFORE conscious cognition, so what ends up happening is that people act (or decide), and only then do they look for a rationale that explains (to themselves) why they did so. We are rationalizing creatures, not rational ones. Why did we go to war? Why did we vote for Clown 1 and not Clown 2? Why do we feel anger flare when someone criticizes our kid or our politics?  Why can’t we HELP ourselves when indulging in one of modern life’s innumerable vices?For me, the answer is Prechter’s Socionomic Hypothesis. Among many other things, it explains why economists laud the last 50 years of monetary/economic lunacy. It explains why this period is suffused with evidence of social decline even as the top line (e.g., stocks) soars higher than ever. It explains why Doom Porn has a constituency, and why women have moved to dominance in many areas of social behavior.We get the world to which our collective mood is predisposed, and that collective mood answers ONLY to endogenous forces. Going to war doesn’t make us angry, we were angry so we went to war. The war doesn’t cause stocks (and social mood) to rise (idiots claim that war is good for stocks by looking at a chart), it was the prior decline in social mood that rose to initiate the war, and rising mood inevitably will snuff out the desire for organized murder and destruction. Too high a mood for too long and you get Open Invitations to murderers, rapists and scum (because we’re SOOOOO trusting.) Such openness coincides with a soaring stock market for a reason, same as it coincides with short skirts and colorful fashions.What must follow this over-long, over-baked social mood mania and the credit bubble, debt bomb and asset mania it produced? Something deeper and probably longer than the Great Depression.  Despite the promise of Socionomics, no timing model yet is trustworthy. We still don’t know when. We don’t know how deep. We can’t know in advance if nadir will be sooner or later, and we can’t know what of today’s Normal will survive.  Maybe it will just be a very bad depression. Maybe it will lead to WROL and the breakup of the USA. Maybe its low will occur near a nuclear exchange, or a resumption of the English Civil War (in the USA.) We’ll know when we get there, I suppose.

        Some time ago I read of an interesting solution to a problem in N Korea. Under pressure from China &amp; because NK could not feed its people, NK began allowing private enterprise. It remains illegal, but Kim is ignoring it. A recent article said 30-50% of NK’s GDP is now produced by the private sector.

            Kim can stop ignoring free enterprise any time he wants, so people engaging in it are foolish.

        If men would stop bowing down to women it would be a good start. This is all about excess. Few would argue against fair and decent treatment but post-modern attitudes, best described as political-correctness is puritanical and excessive and strikes few as fair. That a nobel prize winning scientist would be fired because of a harmless joke is emblematic of a putrid system of thought. Note that there’s no ‘apology to women’ involved but the process is the same.

            Our ‘fin de siecle’ civilization has been driven by excessive feminization.  The progressive era is all about feminine solutions to social problems.  Women’s suffrage gave the biggest boost to socialist policies here and abroad.  Unmarried women are a large demographic of progressive political activism.

                These things are packaged as ‘feminine’. Most women recoil from the feminist movement and its puritanical excesses. If society were able to stand up to this fringe movement, it would be able to stand up to all the excesses of political correctness. If society can’t resist throwing a top scientist to the wolves for the crime of saying something sweet and funny about women in science, how would society stand up for fairness and decency when it comes to outrageous accusations of racism?We’re in a topsy turvy world where America and Britain who fought against the Nazis are apologizing for the Nazis and importing a Muslim society in which hating Jewish people is de rigeur. If that doesn’t make your head spin, nothing will.No wonder that when a pathetic charge of ‘sexism’ is leveled by a fat, ugly, strange-looking ‘woman of color’ at a Nobel prize-winning physicist, the physicist is tossed out the window. Having claimed such a scalp, the movement grows even scarier.

                    The 19th Amendment was a colossal mistake, and must be repealed.
This is an idea which seemed absurd as recently as a few years ago.
Now it is starting to sound like common sense.

            Watching TV last night……….an endless litany of car ads.  Honda highlights the “Helpful Honda People”, donating time and money to animal shelters and the like.  Mazda’s “Drive For Good”  promises that their employees will donate time to local charities.  And Subaru = Love.Who do you think these ads are aimed at?Nothing about the cars themselves, which in older times were advertised as reliable, fun to drive, economical, provide a way to one-up your friends, get you laid, or some combination thereof.Do people really base their car-buying decisions on this stuff?  I’m all for volunteering, but I make zero connection between that and car-makers.  Or am I hopelessly out-of-touch?http://www.ispot.tv/ad/AdcK/mazda-drive-for-good-event-st-jude

        Have you readThe Collapse of Complex Societies,by Joseph Tainter?  He’s an archaeologist who says a lot of similar things, backed with field examples.Your idea about “apologizing for slavery” is especially interesting in this light, given that slavery itself seems to be one of those solutions to old problems, namely the vast labor shortage in pre-Industrial America.  But by the 19th century, an economic solution had morphed into a social problem — when the slave system collapsed under its own weight (which was inevitable, as many saw), race war seemed inevitable.  What was to be done?In any case, all of these historical examples seem to entail the imposition of a new culture by force of arms — the armed force of the old culture against the barbarians, then the force of the barbarians against the decadence of the former conquerors.  In the end, we get as much “culture” as we can militarily handle.

        I just don’t see a reset or shtf scenario on the horizon.
Look at how long the Soviet Union could go on, and they had almost no stuff…while in the US Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is met, even self-actualization.
The current system is backed by something much better than gold, the US Navy!My bet is on a gradual decline, slow &amp; steady, no fall of the Berlin wall like events.

            People largely believed this prior to the Great War. The similarities between now and then go well beyond the superficial. The late 19th century featured the free flow of people and capital. Globalism was the tonic that would prevent war. Then, reality reintroduced itself to the world. The West did not engage in two massive wars due to a lack of food or shelter. It was the only way to clear the decks of old solutions that were no longer relevant.

                        Was the Kaiser really the problem? Frankly, the world does not seem to have ever recovered from the events of 1914. Virtually every modern ill was birthed then– central banking, elimination of the real bills trade clearing system, communism, two world wars, the destruction of Germany THREE times (I’m including Merkel), the rise of the EU, the New Deal and the socialist takeover of the west, Cultural Marxism… Do I have to go on? No, the 25 years leading up to WW1 were clearly some kind of golden age that we were forcibly ejected from.

        come on Z-dog…the history of everything seems a little…off base….if you’re dumb, go to the back of the bus and let the smart while Conservative males make all of the decisions, right Z?  haha….part V points out that Women’s suffrage and civil rights for “Negroes” was just a progressive(Democrat) ploy in order to line up votes?  Women have no need for equality in a man’s world do they Zee?  Same goes for those pesky “Negroes”  How dare they think they should be able to drink from a water fountain or ride in the front of the bus?   I’m a proud Southerner born and bred and I find your breakdown of the North and South of this country to be quite comical so thanks for that big guy!  haha…and btw, who cares what women think anyway?  They were bred to raise the chillun!  Keep up the good work zman!
