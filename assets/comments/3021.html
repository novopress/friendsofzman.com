        The usual suspects that take any and all opportunity to attack Christianity just don’t have enough sense to know who their real enemies are.

        “South Park” once featured a minor character who believed in God, but hated God and dedicated his life to opposing God.  I keep waiting for an “atheist” public figure to take this position.  Hitchens came close at times, but other than that I’m still waiting.

        I’ve always pitied atheists. They’ve denied themselves the ability to conceive of a power higher than themselves, while reveling in their holier-than-thou secular humanistic values.

        A hallmark of the hive minded is to think there can be but two positions on an issue. Atheists think the world is divided into smart clever atheists like themselves and then the mouth breathing sky god worshipers called Christians.
All the fist shaking at the heavens is really just a pose. They are shaking their fist at the people outside their hive.

        The ancient Greeks and Romans considered Yahwism as Atheism since they  didn’t pray to statues, but there was rumors in antiquity that inside of the Jerusalem Temple there was a statue of a man with donkey head or a man seated on a donkey and the jews did human sacrifice swearing hatred for the Greeks forever in the Holies of the holies.

        It strikes me as odd how the atheists rail so vehemently against something that they believe isn’t there. I can’t imagine my self crusading against the non-existent……?As for the idea that God wouldn’t allow bad things to happen to good people, “God allows all possibilities, even atheism.”
