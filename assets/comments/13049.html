            Nonsense. I just know the 2A issue cold. For a generation, gun advocates have worked to de-legitimize the entirely of gun control as irrational and immoral. We have done to the gun grabbers, what the left has done to the so-called conservatives on every single issue. Now, President Gasbag is undoing all of that by embracing the very heart of the gun grabber argument. That is, expediency overrides all other concerns.

                Unless all you 2A “warriors” are willing and ready to put those guns to use — which you manifestly are not — then what is the point of all your fantasizing about “doing the gun grabbers”?  In the meantime, the country has been handed over to the left part and parcel.  It’s all just another kind of cargo cult…

With the exception of guns. The one area our side has made steady progress. It would appear that your argument is self-nullifying. What you “principled conservatives” need to do is look at the 2A people as an example of how to fight. Instead it is more “just surrender on this issue and we promise, pinker swear, we’ll fight the next time.”
Hard pass.

                    Speak for yourself great man.  A little after you demonstrate ability I might consider listening to you
In the meantime, I still have my weapons.  Wanna take them?   Bring extra, and be sure and do it right, because it’s liable to get complex and uncertain if it jumps script.   I am far, far from alone.

                You wouldn’t know that by listening to the way gun grabbers talk. They don’t seem too terribly convinced by these “gun advocates”  rhetoric. I’d say they’re even bolder now, at least back in the day they used to lie about not wanting all of our guns, now the Dems are pushing legislation to ban all semi auto firearms.

There are instances where you just can’t afford to fuck around. Stopping a crazy guy with access to weapons is one of them.
The key for us is keeping the system reasonable, the key for the other side is making it otherwise.
Trump has had a conceal carry permit for decades. I doubt he carries a revolver.
He’s not giving up his right to carry, and he isn’t taking ours, either.

                    That sounds great, but as soon as we make the “crazy guy exception” the Left sets about declaring large swaths of the population crazy until they demonstrate otherwise. In a high trust, white society of yesteryear, these kinds of concession were possible. Not today.

No emergency/extraordinary measures to ‘commit/disarm’ would have been required in the last several massacres.

                            But the Dem controlled Broward County would have been remiss in enforcing all of the elements that were available to them in restraining the nutjob beforehand.  The Left NEEDS these shootings to press their case.  They aren’t about to hurt their own cause by doing the things they are supposed to do to prevent them.

I don’t see that happening. There are the courts, ability to sue, and other checks and balances that would prevent it.

                                In MA the Attorney General – Maura Healey – reinterpreted the firearms laws that have been in place (MA basically has the same laws as the old expired Federal AWB) for decades now.   She RETROACTIVELY declared that further sales of AR-15 (and a few other “assault weapons”) was illegal and must stop IMMEDIATELY.  Her ruling (which the wording changed on weekly) – also declared that all previous sales had been in error – because the law had been “interpreted incorrectly”.For those who don’t understand:  the AWB never outright banned firearms like AR-15’s and FALs and so forth.  What it banned were *features* .  So guns got somewhat neutered.  What Healey did – was outright ban certain firearms.  So it’s a whole new ball game.  By EDICT – not “law”.Mind you – she was referring to MULTIPLE previous State Attorney Generals – who found no such wording or interpretations in the law that she magically found.  And these were DEMOCRAT AGs too boot.Where are the courts? Where are the legislators?  Nowhere to be found.  So far she has gotten away with it.So when people try to tell me that the “courts” and the “checks and balances” will take care of this problem – all I have to say is:Bitch please…………….Anybody who tries to make that argument in this current time is REALLY not paying attention.They need a book party.

                        Exactly. Look, once and for all: the Left does not argue in Good Faith. Like an idiotic Charlie Brown that keeps thinking that Lucy is being honest *this time*, so-called Conservatives love nothing better than abandoning their principles to appear “reasonable” to liberals. It doesn’t work. It impresses nobody. It’s simply a surrender to a tired old Alinskyite trick. The years when we could have negotiated with the Left are long, long gone, if they ever existed.

                        Yes – that’s also (unfortunately) another vital piece of the issue.  Who gets to determine who is is crazy?   We’ve already got the evidence that certain political groups will use the designation of “insane” to silence their political enemies.   And – as you said:  the left has become very in your face and right out in the open and loud about declaring large groups of the population as “crazy”.I believe this is probably part of the reason why this country originally had a militia.  Edwin Viera has pointed out that weapons ownership was not the free-for-all that an awful lot of modern day pro-2A people seem to want to make it out to be.  In the colonial times – and in the early decades of this country – there was a militia.  That militia was something you were *expected* to be part of in some form or fashion (which is another way of saying you were expected to participate in society) – and like when any group of men gets together (women were not involved except on the periphery I believe) – everybody figures out sooner or later who the crazy people are.   Therefore the locals get to know who is likely to be a nutter and go off and threaten the other people in the community.The left has removed that vital societal interaction IMHO.  Progressives gutted the old militia structure and instituted the National Guard.  They are NOT the same thing.  The National Guard – which is liable to Federal dictates in ways the old militia structure was not – is also liable to get sent overseas – another thing the milita was not liable for. It therefore is another cog in the wheel of the Federal progressive power structure.  And when local militias were removed in favor of the National Guard (they used the excuse that the militias had just become social clubs – as if that was a problem) – so was that vital societal monitoring function also removed.Progressivism seems to always seek to destroy community in favor of bureaucracy.  That is my contention here:  we used to have a community based structure that allowed firearms ownership in a vital context that supported the *Republic* as well as being a screening method.  Now we have bureaucracy – which fails to replace that function adequately time and time and time again.And people are dying for those failures – AND they’re trying to blame “the guns” for it all.

                    You hit on the key issue here:  that there are crazy people out there who really should not have access to weaponry.The problem is that the leftie gun grabbers have been talking about all these “reasonable measures” for as long as I can remember (which is decades).  And that whole ” you don’t need a gun – the police will handle it”  has also been excuse #1 in my mind every time they want to ban something or start trending towards confiscation.  This combined with history of what happens when gun grabbers get their way ( read this:https://westernrifleshooters.wordpress.com/2018/03/01/from-over-the-transom-21/)   – is I believe what has led quite a few on the pro-gun side to just dig in their heels and say “no fucking way” to any and all attempts at restrictions or more “reasonable background checks”.Then along comes Parkland – where the police utterly failed to do a goddam thing and it almost looks like they encouraged it.  Up here in MA – concurrently with the Parkland shooting – we had  a nutbag kill a woman the town library with a knife. This nutbag had been terrorizing his neighborhood for a long time – and the police apparently didn’t do much.So one of the cornerstones of the gun grabber’s  argument – that the police should do all the protecting – just got show to be complete and utter horseshit.  They simply can’t or maybe even WON’T take out the nutbags before they go full retard.At the same time this is happening – we have what seems to be a very concerted effort to push more harsher gun control – and possibly even a ban.  Then Trump goes and does his stupid move.I’m already seeing postings on gun forums I frequent that the buying spree has started.I would agree with you: the system needs to be reasonable.  That is defined differently on each side though – and the left side seems to have moved lock stock and barrel to a completely unreasonable state of mind.

                    Yeah, this is a toughie.  Been on the intake side where we got the EDP dispatch and have to go convince the person it would be a great idea to go with our EMT and the nice ambulance guys for a mandatory 72 hour hold to get back on the meds.  And some of those folks were scary, particularly the ones that were not members of the local frequent fliers club whose idiosyncrasies we knew well.  And a couple incidents where PD ascertained there were firearms available to this person and took them.  On the other hand, read enough to know how the Soviets abused “mental illness” and sure as shit live around enough Progs to realize they define anyone that owns a gun as mentally ill.  In place like New York where “due process” is supposed to yield a pistol permit in a reasonable amount of time, the bureaucracy endlessly rope-a-dopes completely legit, sterling charactered applicants.  Hard to see these same guys adjudicating a “seize now, figure it out later” approach.

        Hard to believe he would misread the political landscape this badly.  Is there nobody in the White House that can explain to him that he is betraying the core of his base on the single issue they care the most about?  Somebody should schedule one of those big arena rallies for Trump next week.  When he finds himself standing in an empty building with his own people protesting outside,  maybe he’ll get it

            I find that hard to believe. Blundering into the political strategy he used is unlikely as it was not in any way conventional or intuitive to an urban upper class member, even one familiar with the blue collar culture of long island and the boroughs. Guns are a widely understood third rail even to prog diaspora elites, hence all the money and time spent pushing to change that with younger generations.My read is that this is either a poor attempt to manipulate the left or an indication that he has given up fighting the neolib establishment. Given the timing, I lean towards the former. Even if he intended to be a one term president it would be much easier to ram through unpopular gun control measures after the mid-terms.

        I was on the Trump train early, and I had been an ardent supporter in debates with friends and family. This, however, is inexcusable. I don’t see a way for him to spin his way out of this. I have to admit that I was wrong. He just shat on a huge chunk of his core supporters. I’m out.

        Am I an idiot for thinking that whole blog post was rather obvious satire?
Trump’s just taking some of the steam out of the frenzied liberal mob. Now that he’s given in to them – or so they think – they have nothing to be riled up about. So they can all go home and look for something else to get excited about.
Trump wants to be relected. Unless he’s lost his everloving mind, he knows that gun control of any sort is not the way to do  that.

                That’s the same bullshit rhetoric the Left uses on guns and immigration. “Of course we respect the Second Amendment, but you don’t need these guns for hunting!” “Of course we need to secure the border, but first lets legalize 30 million foreigners and drive them to the voting booth.”
What you are failing to appreciate is the damage a generation of liars has done to the culture. We can no longer afford to bargain in good faith. 30 years of that has us in this mess.

                No one can respect the 2A who does not know what the source of it’s being is, which is not self protection, a thing considered so elemental that no one in that day would think to discuss it. The 2A is to ensure that government maintains a certain level of fear for the governed. Everything the left does tells you they understand this perfectly.

            Trump has to battle the progs *and* the cucks.  If the GOP were not so duplicitous perhaps Trump could take a more straight forward approach to things.  But they are all snakes so he has to go about things in an apparently haphazard fashion.   Why not wait until something bad actually happens, before filling your britches?

                Because – as ZMan said:  When people start saying the things Trump is saying on this issue – they need to know – like RIGHT NOW – that they’re going to burn if they don’t walk it back.
Trump appears to be pandering to the lunacy that is coming out of the left on this issue.  You can’t bargain or try to placate lunatics.  You have to tell them to STFU – and mean it.

Following the lead of Mary Jane growers, thousands of garage  gun manufacturing shops throughout the US, Canada, and Mexico isn’t completely bad, from high regulation, to no regulation.

                Trump is no Zionist, he just doesn’t care about religion and is happy to throw them enough bones to keep them happy. It’s the old GOP strategy of trading infinite support for Israel in return for Jews putting up with a small measure of red-state social conservatism. As an NY realtor/casino mogul Trump knows he needs to keep his bagel well-loxed. Should another Supreme Court appointment come up you can bet Trump will try his best to sell out the pro-lifers — though if they’re smart (don’t you laugh) they could make it difficult for him.

        Ok, Z, I’ll make a bargin with you.I just set a reminder for myself, on April 1st (appropriately, both Easter Sunday and April Fool’s day) called “go mock Zman for his stupid blackpilling”.I’ll bet you that aside from a possible bumpstock ban no significant action will have been taken on guns except that things may get slightly better.  The rough equivalent of a lawn darts ban, taking away a retarded toy from the sort of retards who would play with that sort of retarded toy.If not, I’ll cordially apologize and admit I was wrong, wrong wrong, all is woe and sorrow Trump is the poopiest of the poopers and is made of poop.  If I’m right, you’ll admit you were a blackpilling little crybaby, and we’ll all pat you on the back and sooth you like the blackpilling baby you are.In other words, I’m betting that the guy who is really good at politics won’t, in the end, do anything to piss off his largest contingent.  You’re betting Trump will commit political suicide.  That sounds dumb to me, but you sound very certain.So you play a pretty good fiddle son….well, you know the rest.Shake hands at a bargain, or don’t you put your money where your cakehole live?

            You are not getting it. In the Clinton years, everyone said, “nothing will come from this gay marriage stuff. Just give them civil unions so they can visit their AIDS stricken buddies in the hospital.” Twenty years later the Supreme Court says homosexual marriage has always been in the Bill of Rights, just really, really small print.
That’s how we are in this mess. First it is surrendering the rhetoric. Then it is small concessions. Before long, you’re a monster for opposing anything the Left wants.

                That would be why most people would worry less about rhetoric and more about the supreme court.Further, this is a radical change in tone from your previous comments about trump being dumb gasbag cheeto hands DRUMPFH.  Now we’re talking about the slow evolution of political thought on the issue of gun control over years and multiple presidential elections.   In which case, Trump has at most made a minor misstep in the struggle of years and years.Is that what you’re conceeding?Given that bump stocks have been out for about a year and must have come within an ace of ATFE review failure anyway, I don’t really care about them, they’re dumb and stupid, and I’m not wasting my political capital on dumb boomer toys.  (If they want to ban those tricycle motorcycles, they have my fullthroated support).In general, you are old, father William, and you come from the generation of people that lost all this stuff.That makes me not inclined to listen to your hysterics, because if your hysterics were any use, they would already have been some use. As I’m a young man living in the shithole ruins of what was, by all accounts, a pretty sweet country less than 70 years ago, the only thing about your Hot Take that I notice is the part where you lost.You taking my bet, or are you chickening out, bawk bawk bawk?

                        So we’ve gone from “DRUMPHGHF the TRAITOR” to ‘this is a misstep” (that he corrected with bringing in the NRA for a closed doors convo).
So basically you went full hysteric woman over a misstep (at worst).
And you’re already walking it back from “ALL THE GUNS ARE GONE TOMORROW THE RAPE IS COMING MY ANUS IS LUBED” to “this is a mistake.”

                At this point either you trust Trump or you should’ve long since given up internet poasting on Boomer Blogs to finish your compound innawoods.
Since you’re still using an easily tracked internet connection to disagree with the government, I assume you don’t actually believe your own line, or you’re dumb.

        I am a gun nut. with firearms ranging from black assault rifles right on down to black powder muzzle loaders. There is no doubt in my mind that Lefty wants them ALL, not just the black guns. I firmly believe that if progs start messing with the second amendment – not only is that wrong headed and stupid – they won’t stop there. They will go after other rights and freedoms they don’t like and they will have the precedent to do it. My advice to everyone is bite the bullet, buy an AR15 NOW, and stock up on high cap mags. At the rate things are going, you will probably need them in the years ahead. Just sayin’.Having said all that: I am ‘hoping’ Trump is playing the game like he always does. He will take one step back, and two forward when the timing is right. The media has him by the balls: he can’t accuse them of fake news amidst their blood dancing; the optics won’t work for that. He can’t ignore it, even some conservative cucks are demanding action. In his boots I would bluster and BS and make the right noises… and hope like hell the whole thing blows over without me having to step in that particular pile of chit.

            I have given up on expecting any moral leadership from politicians.  My only grade now is based on whether they advocate my position or not.  We have lost so much ground to the left in the last century because they have no rules except winning, and our bow-tied leaders on the right only want MSM approval and to keep their jobs.  Trump is the first Repub leader since Lee Atwater to fight back.  But he sure is playing with fire on guns and DACA.

Talk about taking a cuck position.  Either you stand for your principles or it is a free for all.  Note that your statement is basically throwing your arms up in the air and enabling the hucksters and manospherists free reign.

        I’m not particularly worried.  A bump stock can be 3D printed and is nothing more than a toy accessory anyway, and I think the legal age to buy guns should be 21, like drinking in most states (and voting if we could do it).  But before a law is passed, however, I would like the same cake baker nazis tell me how a store can refuse to sell a legal item to anyone for any reason if they are legally entitled.  If I had the money, I would grab an 18 year old, sue Walmart for refusing to sell him a gun, and have it joined to the cake suit.The rest was just blowing smoke to politically disarm the those crisis actor kids.  You don’t realize what damage they’re doing, and something had to be done to take some wind out of their sails.  In a negotiation you say “you’re right”.  It’s a called a whip saw, and very effective to shut the other side up when they get emotive.  You later go back to your own position for a different reason.

            I find the bump stock bans troubling, and it’s not clear to me that the Feds have authority to ban them. A bump stock is simply a hunk of plastic. It has no utility until the user affixes it to a firearm. I have the same issue with high-capacity magazines, which are nothing more than a metal box with a spring and a plate inside.States have plenary jurisdiction and can probably ban them under any number of powers, but I don’t see a good argument that the Feds can ban individuals from owning these devices. (The Feds can probably ban the transfer of these devices across state lines per the interstate commerce clause.)

                Well, that’s the argument I’ve used with Progs.  Describe what you are banning.  In precise, legal terms that can be understood and enforced.  They can’t.  When they say “AR-15s”, I ask “do you mean direct gas impingement systems?”.  Even here in NY, can’t buy that operating system with a pistol grip, but can with a straight stock.  A good old fashioned Garand gas piston/rotating bolt is perfectly legal.  Funny thing here is all the SAFE legislation and crap has made zero difference in crime rates.  Ask any senior NYPD guy and he’ll tell you the guns are available, but the aggressive policing and the fact that you will get arrested, be “no bail” at Rikers, get convicted and sentenced upstate is actually a deterrent.  Six years just isn’t worth it.  De Blowhole is trying to undo all that, but cops are fighting him every inch.

            “The rest was just blowing smoke to politically disarm the those crisis actor kids. You don’t realize what damage they’re doing, and something had to be done to take some wind out of their sails.”I think that’s a very good point.  And having raised kids himself, he seems to know how to deflect them when they’re in full manipulation mode.  Of all those marching, demonstrating teenagers, probably only 2% have what it takes to be really committed activists.  The rest are on a self-righteous thrill ride.  One thing about teenagers is, they have short attention spans.  So this Children’s Crusade is going to end one way or another, because kids can’t sustain anything for long.One way of ending it is to just let it peter out, the way the Occupy Wall Street fad did.  But that takes time, and these protesters are a lot more sympathetic and photogenic than OWS was, so in the time it takes for the crowds to dissipate, a fair bit of damage could be done in terms of optics.Trying to force a conclusion is a bad idea, for the same reason: nobody but CNN wants to see police beating up and teargassing 15-year olds.  Plus, that would radicalize some of them and lead to more trouble down the line.No, the best thing to do is give them a quick sugar high by letting them declare “victory”.  The majority will be happy to go home and resume their old amusements, glowing with righteous satisfaction at having “made a difference”.  Only a few troublemakers will want to persist, and soon they’ll look like they’re foolishly clinging to the limelight.

        Do not forget… Trump is a negotiator. He might trade something gun for the wall. Of course, it will be key to not give it away to the left in exchange for nothing.
We’ve seen Trump’s crazy before. He uses it to draw his enemies out. It’s already been noted, 2A is safe. Every time the left remotely hints at gun grabbing, sales go through the roof and Rs shut the F up. Trump is ramping up the crazy to scare the left. You want your diversity areas safer? Block inflows with a wall and disarm them!

        Here’s why 2A and keeping our guns is important. Black run South Africa has just voted to confiscate white owned farm land. That’s our fate in the not too distant future.Please stop and think about all this “hate whitey” speech and PR by the MSM, Hollywood and the Left.  We are being demonized and made to be sub-human creatures who need to be punished.  It’s not going to stop, it’s going to get worse. The Left has no limits, it always wants more.Look what’;s happening on Youtube.If Trump is actually serious about what he said, he’s finished and so is the GOP if they give him a anti-gun bill to sign.

That’s just it. They’ve hollowed out just about every other component of the Constitution to get what they want; the 2nd Amendment is almost the only strategic position they haven’t been able to take.
But they are closer now than ever, thanks to a school shooting and a feckless president.

            Per the NZHerald.co.nz 2/28/18 (on-line New Zealand Herald), Julius Malema introduced the land expropriation bill in South Africa, which passed by a huge margin.  His 2016 quote—“(he was) not calling for the slaughter of ‘white people’, at least for now”.  And so it goes…
Oh yes, and also mention of accusations of some South African political parties “inciting a spate of attacks on white farmers, characterized by extreme brutality, rape, and torture.  Last year, more than 70 people (South African white farmers) were killed in more than 340 such attacks”.

        What I hated was the “stand up to the NRA” comment he made to his own side with Dianne Feinstein sitting right next to him. That is simply accepting the Left’s framing of the issue. Aargh.The legality of bump stocks is based on an administrative ruling by the BATFags. There had been an after market stock for Ruger 10/22s which had a spring which provided energy to continuously move the rifle back and forth once the trigger was pulled. BATF ruled was that this made the weapon functionally fully automatic and subjected it to NFA 1934. The SlideFire stock differed in that without a mechanical means of moving the weapon against the trigger finger, it didn’t count as modifying the weapon for their reading of the law.After Las Vegas, I was pretty much resigned to this ruling being revisited, and bump stocks being declared NFA Class III controlled. It’s been an Executive branch issue all along, and I think Trump has the authority, ultimately, to do that. A quiet ruling by BATFE, rather than running his fat mouth, would have been the best path for him.But I agree with you that this is intolerable. Trump doesn’t understand that this is culture war being waged against the people that elevated him to power. As a matter of fact, I don’t have a sense of humor about this.

        Your analysis is premature. It may turn out to be correct, but there are thousands of moving parts here on every side of the issue. Like you, I didn’t like the President’s comments. I see the 2A as our ultimate backstop against totalitarianism. Which we all feel ourselves being pushed back closer and closer to. So, to begin dismantling that last-resort protection is properly alarming to us. But POTUS isn’t a politician. He steps in things all the time that seem absurd because no politician would make that mistake. You do that very thing here with “even George W. Bush wouldn’t have…”. Donald Trump is the farthest thing from the politically-savvy Bush-Clinton-obama types. I honestly don’t believe he’s thought much about guns in his life. And I’m positive he hasn’t spent any time making political calculations regarding positioning himself and his language to maximize events for his constituents’ political benefit in light of the generational struggle to frame a narrative on firearms. If he was that guy he would’ve been destroyed by the establishment candidates in the primary. Whatever he is, Donald Trump is not an idiot. He is not a politician. I believe he simply is exactly what he appears to be. A political novice who shoots from the hip and occasionally says dumb things. And besides, what are our options? One of the Bushes? John Kasich? Mitt Romney? Or would you feel better with Hillary Clinton? I really enjoy your blog. But this post reminded me of someone throwing a tantrum about having to eat a stale sandwich, when everything else on the menu is poisonous. POTUS has the entire world’s power structure mobilized against him. And he keeps winning. This man has an incredible knack for having the ball bounce his way. This has just been stirred up in the past 24-48 hours. Let’s all calm TF down and wait to see how this develops.

        Eh.  Last week, people on the other side were torching him for saying we should arm select teachers.  Perfectly common sense thing to shorten the time between when a killer starts shooting and when armed resistance arrives.  (that ends the fantasy, and the shooters usually either kill themselves or get shot, and mass shooting ends)  Perfectly rational thing to do which ALSO COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY deprives a perpetrator of his “due process rights”.  If a teacher shoots a mass killer, the government just executed a criminal without due process by definition.  We just have decided that this is OK.Result?  The usual suspects couldn’t wait to get in front of a camera or microphone to preen their sanctimony.  Sign of a good leader:  just freaking say it and stop worrying about what people think.  I watched the exchange.  He was clearly thinking out loud what a LOT of people are thinking:  how the hell did that stark raving mad lunatic in FL get all those weapons when everybody knew he had them, and they had multiple phone calls reporting him?It was a total breakdown of the legal system which prevents law enforcement from acting on some of these tips.  As with arming teachers, he was pretty clearly stating that we need a way to short circuit a very long and complex legal process in order to get the guns out of the hands of stark raving mad lunatics.That is a perfectly reasonable statement to make, especially in the context of the fact that basically nobody on this blog or anybody you know has any direct connection to what happened in FL.Personally, I favor the “Mad Dog” law.  We have dozens of eyewitnesses to this guy Cruz shooting people.  Everybody saw it.  The law needs to be rewritten for these cases such that the perpetrator is taken before a magistrate once captured, eyewitnesses are brought in who can positively identify the shooter, any additional evidence is presented like the weapon, the judge issues a conviction and a death penalty verdict, and they take Viktor Cruz out behind the courthouse and they shoot that SOB in the head.  Then they cremate the remains and throw them in the court house trash dumpster.But it is a perfectly reasonable statement to make that if we know of a stark raving mad lunatic with a gun, that law enforcement be able to go in there and disarm him and let the courts catch up with the process.Cripes, that’s the basic premise of Dirty Harry Callahan…just effing deal with the person and THEN let the legal system sort it out.

Nah.  We’ve been able to kill the perpetrator to defend ourselves since forever.  There’s no reason to put yourself in danger so a court can decide if that person broke the law.

                That’s my point.  We have legal procedures in this country which give private citizens, and the government, the right to deprive an individual of his life and property if he/she is deemed a legitimate threat…and we do not need to go to court in advance to take these steps.  You, me, the cops, we can pull the effing trigger, and let the courts sort it out later.That’s the basic reason why George Zimmerman was not convicted, along with many, many, police officer-involved shootings.To use your words, “There’s no reason to put the public in danger so a court can decide if you’re crazy before  you break the law (and murder 17 children and teachers in a school).”

            Trump really does operate as an animated stream of consciousness in his conversations.  Channel it, put it in context, then push him, hard, in the right direction.  His instincts are on our side, we need to work him to follow through.  Our turning our backs on him and shunning him is EXACTLY what the Left is, ahem, gunning for.  They salivate like hungry hyenas at the prospect.  Don’t give them the satisfaction.  Hopefully I am channeling, putting in context, and shoving hard for your stream of consciousness to lead you in the right direction (not you Hokkoda).

                I think people are listening to the media spin on this.  Trump is an actual LEADER.  What you see when you watch him in that meeting is an actual leader, ACTUALLY THINKING.  He’s not worried about polls and being on the “right side” with this or that group.  He’s legitimately asking what we can do to keep guns out of the hands of stark raving mad lunatics.  I wouldn’t even call it stream of consciousness which is kinda random.  Looked and sounded to me like he was offering up actual frickin’ ideas instead of the usual bombast and speechifying.It’s like his smacking Sessions around on Twitter the other day.  The Government Party (to which Sessions belongs) is used to this idea that they get put in charge of the bureaucracy, but don’t actually have to do or accomplish anything. Along comes Trump, and he’s riding herd and kicking people like Sessions in the ass.  The man’s already fired 3-4 major players in a 13 months.Yeah, the Dems will salivate, but they and everybody else are playing from the “old” rulebook.  People still haven’t figured out Trump.

How did all these guns protect the constitution?  They didn’t.  How did all these guns protect unborn children?  They didn’t.  And on and on and on.   The majority of Americans just don’t care about anything except feeding their fat faces, and getting high/drunk/stoned.
Zman has never been a Trump guy and never will.   This is just a temper tantrum column; you can practically see the spittle on the screen.

                    What difference would it make? Where’s the benefit of Trump if he is not doing any of the things he promised and he’s siding with the gun grabbers? Basically, the GOP argument for my whole life has been “Vote for us, we’ll kill you slowly.” No thanks.

                        My hunch is that Trump is not playing politics with this issue and simply believes his approach is common sense.  I agree this is naivete on the scale of Bush I, and Trump is only setting the stage for further gun restrictions.  You can give no quarter to the anti-constitutionalists.  The 2A was meant to protect us from the government, which has gone from muskets to SWAT teams.  We need our own SWAT teams just to keep up, which means less restrictions, not more.  I still think overall Trump has moved the ball from our own 20 yard line to around the 50, but this was an unnecessary fumble.

                            The 2A is also designed let people enforce an orderly society, from those who would destroy that:https://westernrifleshooters.wordpress.com/2018/03/01/from-over-the-transom-21/======I have little medical training as it is not my field, however I have probably seen more human anatomy than most doctors… not less than multiple thousands of bodies on the ground and parts of them hanging from bushes, on rocks and lodged in tree limbs. Images of 206 dead lining both sides of a makeshift airstrip in the middle of nowhere once… most killed in about 45 minutes by a tribe with weapons, against a tribe without.I know there were that many because I walked the airstrip drinking a beer and smoking cigarettes counting them. So many bodies, some ripped to pieces by automatic weapons fire, that there was a separate pile for arms and legs not matched to the dead. The elderly… men, women, children… babies. Maddening.Firearms and 2nd Amendment rights are a contentious and volatile issue in America… but unknown to most Americans it is a pressing issue in other countries. I have lived in and spent extended periods of time in many countries. Usually covertly in the back bush illegally in countries.The firearm is an issue overseas, not because of the many weapons there and carnage from, but who does have them, and the general populace not having them. Denial of a basic human right… that of effective self-defense… usually against government.“No one needs an ‘assault rifle’!” so the saying goes. “No one needs ‘large capacity ammunition magazines’!” is the mantra. “Evaluate owners, legislate, restrict… confiscate!” …is the rallying cry of ‘progressives.’ But, I have witnessed first-hand how the initial simple registration and required legal permissions gave birth to total confiscation and allowed another… in a never-ending line of corrupt, violent, brutal and repressive police states in the world… to come to fruition.White and black living in terror daily of being arrested with impunity, jailed, starved, tortured to death and flat out killed. Children tortured and mutilated in front of their helpless parents by governments the outside world supports… in prisons built with foreign aid by countries that loathe most of the donors. If the souls of those people could speak.When a veteran BBC cameraman, accustomed to the carnage of battle zones, vomits while filming the remains of a tortured political opponent found in a ditch, it gives you an idea of the degree of barbarism that exists there. It gives new meaning to the term “get medieval on them.”The six-month-or-so-old baby roasted over a fire in the dark hours of the night by ‘freedom fighters’ from the same tribe they are ‘liberating.’ Done simply to terrorize and create blind obedience and have the world blame others. At first, we couldn’t understand what we were looking at… we thought it was a piece of meat until we saw the remnants of protruding bones of what remained of the appendages. No skull. We couldn’t tell the sex or whether the two-inch branch it was impaled on was forced through its anus or vagina.This is the world I have lived in and most of those members of my Special Forces Chapter have experienced… this is the realism of the existence of the majority of people of the world.“Can’t happen in America!?” “America has outgrown the need for firearms!?” “We have a democracy… why do you need guns, are you afraid of the police?” You would be hard pressed to find anyone in most other parts of the world that harbor those illusions. They have experienced ‘progressive.’ They have experienced ‘government.’59 innocent souls gunned down in Las Vegas!? That happens weekly and monthly in most parts of the world and we only hear about it if the American military is involved or American citizens are threatened or killed. So much ceremony, reverence and observance of death here… but absent in most of the world. The bodies are pushed in a hole and covered… then life, or I should say, their miserable existence, continues. A good share in Africa are killed with pangas… semi-sharp machetes. Those doing the killing, usually the authorities, have plenty firearms and ammunition… but they prefer this method because it inflicts much more pain and fear…What I know people become by their nature, how tyrants rule and what foolish, illusionary ideologies decree and eventually forcefully impose on citizens at the point of a gun, strengthens my resolve that ALL citizens must have the unfettered and unrestricted right, whether they want to possess or not… assault rifles, large capacity magazines, fully automatic weapons and whatever else is in the realm of firearms and protection. Gun laws and even confiscation will not stop it… not flooding Americans with SSRIs such as Prozac and such poisons may diminish it.The totally subdued, abused and terrorized citizens, comprising most of the world’s people, quietly and desperately clamor for the right to defend themselves against this barbarism, violence and injustice… but they can’t ‘legally’ own firearms because they were disarmed “For the good of public safety…”=====

                        Exactly.I used to use the following argument for why I voted Republican over Democrat:” The Democrats come right out and say they’re going to raise my taxes.  The Republicans at least *say* they’re going to lower them.  Now I know the Republicans are likely lying to me – but when they lie to me – at least I have something I can screw them with if they don’t keep their promise.  If I vote Democrat – knowing full well they just SAID they’re going to screw me – now I’m the idiot if I vote for them thinking they won’t.  Especially when they history says they definitely will”.As soon as the Republicans fully made the transition over to being the Democrat Lite party – there was very little reason left to consider voting for them.I voted for Ron Paul because he was stick in the spokes – and I voted for Trump for the same reason.

You’ve reduced yourself to the level of a lobotomized Obama-bot, the only difference is you wear a red MAGA hat.  And you think I’m naive simpleton?  lol, ok.

There are currently so many black swans out there it will be easy for our government to chose one and pursue an agenda. And the MSM will do what the PTB tell them to.You say you want a revolution ? Ban Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Welfare, Food Stamps, and other programs people need to live. The new ruling class will evolve quickly.

            The cucking in this comment section is strong. If Progs and socialCUCKS have one thing in common, it’s their distaste for compromise and pragmatism. “Trump isn’t pure enough! Boo-Hoo, wo is us! Protect us from those evil Progs!”
The socialCUCKS always vote R. The crazier the anti-gun rhetoric gets, the more reliable R voters cucks become.

        Zman, I love you, man, but you need to be talked down from the ledge.Trump is not an idiot. You mentioned DACA, so you know we’ve been down this path before. He lost me when he said almost two million wetbacks should get amnesty. Now we know that is not happening.Trump has not built the wall, that is true. But I imagine myself as president and how I’d turn the ship of state around. Ship: Something that is not easily or quickly turned. DACA is dead. Trump is working at the margins in slowing immigration – illegal and legal. If I were president, I’d be curled up in a ball trying to figure out to unfuck the nation. So, Trump lost me on DACA. But now it’s dead, and that is good. They are not getting amnesty. Lesson learned. Trump is not an idiot, as I said.He said lunatics should not be able to own guns. He’s right. And you know what? He’s right. They shouldn’t. It’s silly to argue otherwise. But I know, you know, and we all know the Left will inexorably redefine lunacy to include anybody they want. So we say No. This is to say that we will allow the deaths of innocents occasionally – in horrible, gut-wrenching and appalling ways. That is the price of freedom, and that’s OK. Trump knows this because is smart. More than that, he is a mean badass son-of-a-bitch. He is baiting the Left to come up with something: and they will. It will also be unacceptable. As he did with DACA. I know people who have done business with Trump. He is ruthless. He wins. He is smarter than the gay mulatto. He is cunning.He is also not the best president we could get. He is no George Washington. He is vain, arrogant, and cruel. He is what we got, and we got him at the right time. It was a miracle he won the presidency. We were lucky. 1/3 of the people will vote for any shitty Democrat, like Hillary. 1/3 of the people will vote for any Republican, like Bush (any one of them). Most of the others won’t vote. Every election hangs by a thread, as our nation becomes browner and more mestizo. But we lucked out, and the augurs are good.This is not to say I am optimistic, for, sooner or later, Trump will leave the stage. However, to use a phrase that may become a cliché, he is moving the Overton Window. I still think the nation will split, but at least it will split in a way that normies can live. Whenever I let my emotions determine my actions, I screw up. Trump’s DACA opening offer was a confirmation that we put our hopes in the wrong guy. I am pretty sure that I was wrong in that.Trump will not weaken 2A. He is playing with the Left and energizing the Right. The NRA, God bless them, is an amazing lobbying organization. The only one on the Right. But they nearly screwed the pooch in participating CNN’s show trial, where they risked being de-platformed. They were set up and walked into a trap. Trump told a bunch of cucks and Leftists (but I repeat myself) that they fear the NRA. The Left will overreach because of that challenge, as they did with DACA, and they will get nothing. Trump just helped the bloodied NRA.Wait a couple of months or so before you write him off before you conclude that Trump will do to the Second Amendment what no Lefty – even a commie like Obama – dared.Love your podcast (it’s one of the best) and I always look forward to my Friday evening cigar with you. I’m kind of dreading tomorrow show though.

        This is what happens when Trump talks first and thinks later.  He does it all the time.  We need to keep the pressure on him 24/7, but understand that he is a normie dealing with a bunch of abnormal people in DC.  He is learning as he goes, and he does appear to be a quick learner.  As Karl keeps pointing out, are you gonna go with McTurtle and Eddie Munster instead?Speaking of normies and DC, the Hope Hicks resignation is instructive.  She started out as a model and working for Ivanka, segued into Trump’s businesses, and then into his campaign and administration.  She seems smart (except for boyfriends), and genuinely appears to be a normie outsider.  The DC abnormies rolled her into an 8 hour closed hearing earlier this week, and she came to understand that if she didn’t roll over on her boss, they would find a way to send her up the river for half of the rest of her life, on some technical violation of something or another.  So she bailed, and will spend the occasional weekend with Ivanka and the kiddos, instead of working for the Donald.  That is how the swamp protects its swampiness.Trump is like that school kid who does great things, and then gets caught out doing something really stupid.  I’ll quickly abandon him when we have someone better to turn to, but who would that be?  The better person has to not only have better ideas, but be in a position to jam them through the swamp.  You need both.  I don’t see any alternatives out there.

        No one (including Trump) is immune from the epidemic of stupidity. It has now become so pervasive in our culture that it’s like gravity, constantly pulling our thinking capacity downward.
We’ve been veering into the ditch for quite a while now. Conservatives want to enter the ditch more slowly, and Progressives want to head for the cliff immediately. Slow death or suicide. May you live in interesting times.

        From day one Trump has stumbled into every trap Obama and his henchmen have laid.  From Flynn to Comey to Mueller – he’s been 5 steps behind.  It has SERIOUSLY hindered his agenda and put immense stress on this administration.  These traps were recognizable, avoidable and unnecessary.  Anyone suggesting Trump is allowing himself and his staff to be fed through the meat grinder in order to ‘draw his enemies into a trap’ is certifiably blind.Another common argument from loser-minded cuckolds is that Trump must push every facet of his agenda in a round about, sneaky manner.  This is patently absurd.  A great deal could be done right now from his desk with his pen without meaningful, long-term push back or harm to his political aspirations.  One example:http://bit.ly/2oH3zxqAlso, there is no reason to lend credence or give undue attention to the left’s platform.  This is a problem plaguing the larger ‘conservative’ movement, but Trump surrounding himself with gossips, Bush-lite warhawks, progressives and gullible family members doesn’t help and the residual infighting, security leaks and revolving door of his staff hurts him and speaks to a lack of maturity and leadership in the administration.I spent a lot of time in 2016 working for the Trump campaign convincing hand-wringing boomers to support Trump, only to watch them now flop over, make excuses and pass off every mistake he makes as 4-D chess.  If Zman wants to rap a hard one across Trump’s knuckles when he gets out of line then I think it’s well deserved.  Trump is a good guy, but he’s no master strategist.  If he’s gone in 3 years who is really going to shed a tear?  Anyone suggesting Trump is their only hope is ignoring history, the times in which we live and the overarching goals of a movement that existed long before any of us were born.

                Nonsense.  Did Trump walk into the voting booth and pull that lever for you?  No one ‘saved’ you from Hillary.  You and I and millions of others did.The fact that you guys can’t criticize Trump, even in a light-hearted, joking manner makes you look like death cult progressives gazing at themselves in a mirror.  It makes you weak.  It makes you put up with crap when if it was anyone else spouting this garbage you would be tearing down the doors and burning up the phones demanding they respect the things that we (and our sires) have fought for and won over the course of many years.

                    Look, I am not happy with his 2A positioning, but I will take what I can get.You fight the battles with what you have, not what you wish you had.  He has done a better job, on the whole, than I would have expected by now out of any “electable” candidate from the 2016 election process.  Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.  And don’t turn your back on Trump.  By doing so, you fall into the trap set by the Left and the media.  Trump is full of flaws and contradictions, but, honestly, give me a name of anyone, present or future, who can both get elected and force this sort of overall agenda on the swamp.  One name, one person.  Anybody?

                        Those are crickets you’re hearing, Dutch.Not only do they not have anyone, theyreallydon’t have anyone who could withstand 1/16 of the withering attack Trump and his family have endured.While still succeeding.This melee here smacks of the comment sections all over the right side of the political spectrum during the primary where if Cruz was your guy you were a stooge for Goldman Sachs and his EVIL Wife who’s but a Soulless Shill for the CFR, and if you were for Trump you were a mayonnaise-sandwich eating, knuckle-dragging, eminent-domain loving closet Democrat.Yes, it warms the cockles of my heart how quickly the circular firing squads reconstitutes itself  on our side of the aisle.It’s fine to lose your shit over Trump looking like he’s getting wobbly on the 2A. Scream your bloody head off. It’s your birthright, and if he’s really f-ing up, maybe he’ll hear your pleas and correct course.But renouncing the man outright? WTF is the matter with you guys? Tell me ONCE where he’s actually screwed us since his inauguration. Once?  And I’m not referring to his loose talk or tweets or even sometimes poorly reasoned arguments, but anactual examplewhere we’re already worse off than we were before him.God, calm down for fucksakes.

            So..we’d be better off with Hillary? Or we should’ve all voted for Jeb? Which would be a vote for Hillary. I don’t get it. Prez isn’t above criticism, but I think he’s doing okay under the circumstances. He has the entire Washington establishment actively sabotaging everything he does, says, plans or even thinks about. The other party is fully mobilized (no surprise). The media is a 24/7 anti-Trump hate-fest. Western European leaders can’t go a day without heaping hate on him. His own party has spewed bile at him since he announced his candidacy. And he just keeps winning. I’ve been mystified by some of his personnel choices. Huge mistakes, I’ve thought. And Sessions’ recusing himself has unleashed a never-ending witchhunt that’s dogged the entire first year of his administration. But what’s the alternative? In real life, the alternative was Hillary. You and I agree that WE would’ve come in there like a boss and started laying down the law. I’d loved to have seen POTUS be more aggressive. But neither you nor I got nominated. He’s a political novice. He’s never run for, nor held any political office. He never got the chance to make mistakes as a city councilman or mayor or congressman. This is it. He’s screwed up some stuff. But we all wanted an outsider. Well…we got an outsider. Who’s making mistakes for the same reason he got elected: He’s never done this before. Everyone needs to relax. And the alternative was Hillary. So, I’ll cut the man some slack.

                Why do Republicans insist on reverting this this binary outcome?  Any criticism of Trump makes that person an instant Hillary supporter.  It’s like reading the comment section of Breitbart.
Trump is given plenty of slack from the plebs, partially due to said media constantly attacking him.  Every now and then all politicians need to be reminded of who put them in office and who can remove them should they wander too far off the range.

        Hard for me to believe you’re this dense when it comes to understanding Trump. Do you honestly expect him to broadcast his every move? Can you not imagine him using deception to position himself and make his political opponents look bad? Have you been paying attention?

        Setting the gun shitshow aside, I disagree that Trump has accomplished nothing.  His wonderful use of Twitter plus the Russia fetish has kept the MSM focused on the bullshit of the day and therefore not paying much attention, if any, to the growing list of accomplishments documented by the Heritage Foundation.
With 2-3 more SCOTUS replacements coming in the next 18-24 months… the winning will continue.

        America is a one party system. “Voting” with anything but rule .308 is a form of masturbation. It may make you feel better but it does little else. This very stupid and short sighted act by PT Barnum er “DA Donald” just cost Trump and the Republicans the rural south and mid west in the mid terms and maybe 2020. But maybe it was supposed to do just that. I know that the Republicrats have lost me for good with this one. It is passed time we let the communist take over, start the civil war we all know is coming, and finally decide who gets exterminated. I hate what America has become, and only cleansing  fire can fix what is broken. Voting is useless.

        Maybe Trump won’t actually do anything on guns. I hope so. But am I really supposed to give him some kind of big thumbs up if he doesn’t? Don’t think so. He’s a Republican. He’s not *supposed* to pass any new gun control laws. As Chris Rock said, you don’t get extra credit for doing stuff you’re just *supposed* to do. “I know I said I might pass the most radical new gun control in 25 years, but in the end, I didn’t!” What do you want, a cookie? Even if he doesn’t sign any, demonizing his closest allies and ceding the moral high ground to his enemies on this issue was phenomenally stupid, a yuge backstab, or both.I tire of the public cucking and subsequent reversals, and of the “Will he turn heel or not?” bullshit. You’re not at goddamn Wrestlemania anymore, Mr. Trump. Act like the president of a first-world country. Lead. Support your base. Dance with who brought you. No more treating your base like a beaten housewife who just burned the pot roast, and enough with the fucking six-dimensional interstellar backgammon. This incident is the point at which that jumped the shark. I want honesty, courage, and leadership. “I’ll say I’m going to betray my most passionate supporters and then count on Paul Ryan to save me from having to commit to whether or not I’d really do it if the bill hit my desk” isn’t what leadership looks like.

        What this post has shown me is that the all-or-nothing attitude so rife here, is exactly what has allowed the left to take over and dominate this society.  And at the end of the day, it is just an excuse to bitch and moan and never do anything about it.Trump has done more to swing American society back the other way, than every other GOP president this century — added together.  Because none of them did a damn thing other than make speeches.  And yet all the hungry kittens here just mewl and mewl because he made a few off the cuff remarks about magic metal, AKA guns.Watch this scene:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2EQ0FlVks4.  *That* is the power that Trump has, and which makes him irreplaceable.   You fukking cucks disgust me with your bullshit tough talk, like your little girl hurt feelings justify withdrawing support from the one president that is actually standing up for you for once.  Just forget about how you can influence people and grow your “movement”; stick to masturbating, it’s what you do best.

                I don’t see that, Z. The Kristol-Kasich-Bush-Romney argument is to surrender on everything. A never-ending compromise with leftists where our side caves and given them most of what they demand and call it bipartisan. Then the left comes back immediately and demands the rest of what they wanted, so our side caves and gives them most of what they want again. All in a futile effort to get the media to like them and crow about how “sensible” they are for reaching across the aisle. Trump isn’t doing any of that. If anything, you sound more like the National Review Conservatism, Inc. nevertrumper crowd by spending your energy heaping hate on your own side while the other side wants you dead. It’s a version of Trump Derangement Syndrome. #Irrational

                    I am firmly in Karl’s and J_Longstreet’s camp on this one.  I will drop Trump, once I see a better choice.  It ain’t there, and it ain’t gonna be there.  DC is the place for weirdos, and normies get run out, one way or another.  It takes a certain sort of personal weirdness and dedication to pursue what Trump is doing, see it through as best you can, and use all of the diversionary tactics and unexpected twists to get from here to there.  Is Trump a mental 5D Superman?  Is he lucky?  Is he some sort of idiot savant?  Or maybe an enemy plant?  I really don’t care.  Doesn’t matter.  I’ll ride his train as long as it is more or less going in the right direction.  And I absolutely refuse to give an inch to the Chuckie-Nancy crowd, ever.  If following Trump to the end gives them heartburn, that alone is worth something, in my book.

            The only people I see on this blog taking the ‘all-or-nothing’ approach is you MAGA boomers and Zionists.  You can’t handle any criticism of your boy so you whine and throw out one liners like “The only choices you will have in the future will be Trump or some rehash of Hillary.” or “We are lost without Trump”.Could you be anymore of a cuckold?  What are you going to do when Trump is really gone?  Find a shiny new politician to define you and your ideals?Loyalty has it’s limits.  If you can’t handle or admit that then the only one viewing the world in all-or-nothing terms is you.

        Trump was for a national firearm waiting period for the decades he was a New York Democrat.  Trump had the Clintons at his wedding and they were laughing it up at the reception.  Trump loves unconstitutional asset forfeiture and so does his attorney general Jeff Sessions, and Trump loves eminent domain, so he’s not a Constitutional guy or a property rights guy.  He’s a big government guy.  Trump donated a lot of money to Democrats, but he also donated a million dollars to Mitch McConnell’s reelection campaign PAC when I was volunteering my butt off trying to replace King Of The RINOs McConnell in 2014, when Trump was probably contemplating running as a RINO.  Gun grabbing first and due process second?  Color me not surprised at this inevitable betrayal.

        In the same week that Don announced he would like a second term, he says the one thing that guarantees he will be disappointed in that quest – as I explained to him in my email yesterday.  The wall at the Mexican border is a fools errand and its inevitable absence will not affect my vote; however, a roll over on gun control, and I will vote for plan B.

        I see this sort of post, a lot. I believe we need to ask one question. Looking back, when has President Trump gone back on what he said he would do? He has been blamed for turning back on what he said but the final product was exactly what he said he would do.  I am a huge Firearms supporter.  I have been a Life Member of the NRA since age 16 and have been putting on a Gun Show for over 30 years.  I was collecting items that were made illegal in 1968 and watch closely for that “camel’s nose” under the wall of the tent.  I CANNOT think of a single person that has done what he/she said they would do except for President Trump.  We need to support him.  We need to put out signs around schools calling them what the are: “Killing Fields”.  Pol Pot would be proud.  Our children are being killed by a bill that was written and supported by Joe Biden in 1990 or 1991.  He created “Killing Fields” and that is a fact.  Don’t be the “weak spined group” and stand with the ONLY person for scores of years that has stood for the Constitution.

        I believe that Trump is just staying out ahead of the demoncrats on the gun ban issues they cry about and something else will come up next week.  He doesn’t intend to do anything gun control wise, but his comments let the media and certain loud mouth politicians lose balance in response.He ain’t stupid and loves to rile up people…..

        With the non-stop incessant coverage of the shooting I believe the president put a stopgap measure and told his critics what they wanted to hear.as mentioned before this will take the wind out of their sails and give him some breathing room.  He could very well be a sell-out but I doubt that based on his past history.He obviously knows his base is very pro-second Amendment and if he’s seriously looking to get reelected he’s not going to jeopardize that.I take all the media coverage with a grain of salt these days . Even you mr. Z man. I was a huge Glenn Beck fan even bought his book.He turned out to be a horrible traitor.  The president could very well be a fool and your concerns and criticism warranted.But until this so called treason comes to fruition I will keep my doubts.

        Ours is an age of moral chaos. It won’t end well, but it will end soon – we can’t go on like this. The empty-headed fanaticism of one side scores victories on all fronts, while our side seeks leadership from a man who, for all his brashness and intelligence, doesn’t seem to know what it’s all about.
I won’t give up – yet – on the Donald. But the day is growing late. 2020 appears to be the official date at which America goes full communist. I just hope it won’t be the Pol Pot variety.

        Didn’t this just happen with DACA?  Lets see what happens next Monday when that expires.And I think of this as the evil and stupid conservatives that were silent or barely mentioned the war on drugs Civil Forfeiture, or the IRS that does the same kind of seizures without any due process every day.  Including with the FDA on Kratom, AG Session’s reversal of Obama’s rule to end Policing for Profit, and Marijuana.If you are upset about seizing property without due process, lets end it completely – stop taking money first with not quite due process (probable cause, not reasonable doubt) later.

            Different issue, different parameters. On immigration, the bad guys still hold the high ground. “We’re a nation of immigrants” still works on the honky. On guns, we have the high ground. There is no reason to give a centimeter of ground. In fact, we should be taking ground. Instead, Trump is waddling down the hill, locking arms with Diane Feinstein and shaking his fist at the NRA and American gun owners.

                Zman, thanks for continuing to flesh out your reasoning.
We should be hammering the continued, methodical, willful, cowardly failures of Law makers, law ‘enforcement’ and ‘progressives’, media and all others, to ‘uphold’ existing laws and processes.
Attack with audacity. Relentlessly. Expose and punish….. Mock and villify the unions in Gubmint. Chase &amp; prosecute cowards. Cut the fat. Zero their budgets and expose their precious pensions and benefits to seizure or revocation….

                Yup, but the answer for today is to beat Trump mercilessly about the head and shoulders for doing such a stupid thing, not to send him to political Siberia.  We need him, we really need him.  His starting point is our side, his success is due to our side, and we need to remind him that our side will not bend on this one.  He knows where his bread gets buttered, and it ain’t Dizzy Dianne Feinstein.  Remind him of it, every chance you get, in every way possible.  Giving him the “F-U” sendoff is a good way to get one in return from him.  Then where are we at?

        Major overreaction Z.  Gun restriction of any kind has zero percent chance of getting through the House.  First with DACA offerings, then with infrastructure, now with this, Trump is casting himself as a great compromiser.  At best, this buys him some Dem goodwill on the aforementioned projects, at worst itvgains him nothing, and the 2A remains in either case.
Edit: but I still appreciate folks holding his feet to the fire

            That’s OK with me. Trump’s main  job was to buy us time to prepare for a civil war and maybe get us a little less immigrationIt appears that indirectly by creating a gun panic  he’ll do just  that and he’s done a tiny bit on the immigration issue. Not a lotthough there are loads of opportunities to break the back of the sanctuary states . Unless this happens, he isn’t in charge as God Emperor  and is a doctrinal Heritage Republican which is fineHe although with all do respect talks too much and thinks to little for my taste.I’ve long ago come to the conclusion that baring an .Alt Right or similar takeover , succession or a total collapse all of which create all manner of new troubles  the problems in the US cannot be resolvedIts going to comer to war sooner or later and the sooner the Right gets this the better off we’ll beIgnoring the Republican Looter-Cucks this is a painful process happening in glacial political time and bringing  actual Conservative and Civ Nats like Kurt Schilcter on board is a slow process.Its getting there and if we get lucky and do it fast enough we can avoid the bloodshed. If not? So be it

        To me it looks like the classic player/pickup artist tactic of Agree and Amplify.  All the bleating for gun controll and libtards calling him Hitler and then he says, yeah,  let’s just start ignoring enumerated rights.  And the dumbasses cheered, as thousands more voters wake up.

        Stop acting like a faggot. This has been Trump’s game over and over, but you panty wetting midwits still haven’t caught on. Go put on a pussy hat and vote Kamala Harris, then, you fucking retard. Anyone sitting out the next election might as well suck tranny cock. Pack of gamma geez shitheads.

        Look, does anyone seriously think the President is a fern-bar faggot? He’s trying to triangulate. It’s not that he is deeply committed to gun rights – or anything – but as long as he’s in office he will be a bulwark against the left. Do you think Putin fears Trump will attack him except for show after a friendly warning? If you want Steve Bannon or Pat Buchanan figure out how to get them elected. The only argument that Trump is a minus is that the water around the frog would have boiled faster without him. But recent events suggest that the frog is too feeble, impoverished, confused, and timid to jump out of the water. Anglin hiding in Cambodia while the Charlottesville Nazis head off to jail and lifetime ostracism. Right wing groups bounced from Facebook, PayPal, Google, easily and sans pushback. The right has yet to stage an event with more than a few hundred attendees. I remember the March on Washington with hundreds of thousands. Use what’s left of the Trump presidency to educate the public and hope for the best.

        All of us Rand Paul supporters already told you this would happen and who Trump really is, you ignored and mocked us. Same goes for the elections before that with the even better Ron Paul running (he’s been warning of this stuff for decades – way ahead of the curve).

                    Aren’t they pretty much the same on issues though?
Outside his Muslim ban, Rand Paul didn’t seem to differ in his stance on border security from fellow GOP acolytes Bush, Cruz, Rubio, ext.  In other words, he paid lip-service to a policy that is non-existent.  As for Marijuana, just last month Rand pushed for pot legislation to be included in the recently passed spending bill.
