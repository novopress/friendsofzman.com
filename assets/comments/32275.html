        Sorry to be off topic but regarding patriotism:Last week, I shopped for fireworks to take to a 4th of July celebration. I had no idea what I was doing and I asked two kids for suggestions. These two 19 or 20 year old guys immediately set their cart aside and relinquished their place in line to walk around with me and help me find the best stuff. I wish I could share the experience with their parents but it’s lost to time.Stories of murder and mayhem caused by “youths and teens” abound. Meanwhile, the experience above is an example of what our youth do. It’s just stuff white people in white communities do.It’s natural to lose that love for country when crossing over to this side of the divide. There is a sense of loss which can be difficult, particularly coming from a patriotic, military family. But that has gradually been replaced by a love for our lineage, a love for our people. And that is far more meaningful.

                Dear Melissa,
If you are White andNOTv@xxinated, then are you still young enough to be bursting viable follicles every month?
If the answer to the question is “Yes”, then muh Pμrebl00dedWhiteseed is rather eager to start putting Pμrebl00ded White bunz in your White oven.
SRSLY.

            My redoubt is in an Amish/Mennonite area. The young men I deal with make me feel better about the coming rebuilding. Funny how not being gaslit by society clarifies one’s purpose.

            Great post. Thank you for sharing it. That is the silver lining. Our consciousness as a European people comprised of partilarized local peoples is emerging. Of the course the circumstances for this emergence are unprecedented in scale and gravity. Those young White men are a blessing. The future is us preserving that genteel and open kindness for our folk and using solely within our kind to our significant advantage. Thank you again for sharing this.

            Melissa:  This is so en pointe.  Since we moved to the Ozarks my daily interactions are almost exclusively with White people.  Not the wealthiest or the best educated or always with the most functional lives – but unfailingly polite, courteous, friendly, helpful, and doing their best to do a good job.  Not having to pay the ‘diversity tax’ in daily life has removed a huge burden from our shoulders, to a degree even we underestimated.  I love these tough, independent Scots-Irish whose ancestors came from Virginia and Tennessee and Kentucky, and forged lives in these hills and hollers.

        Yarvin is the most Jewish man alive when you read his stuff. It’s just pilpul, ten billion words meaning nothing with no solutions other than that he’s dead certain he’s better and more intelligent than you are. I particularly love that he went ahead and named the american power structure “The Cathedral” instead of the dead obvious and far more accurate “The Synagogue”. Funny how that works.

            Exactly. This pre-Jewish thing Catholic was vaguely flattered by his thoughts. However, I knew that to blame all of our current woes on Protestantism was false. Post Jewish thing and finding his real name, he was obviously just intent on blaming all of Christianity for the modern world.“The Cathedral” was the (or at least a) solution, even by his own thoughts. “The Synagogue” was accurate description of our overlords and the world he described. Not one word about the Jews in all that musing.

            It actually would be the best thing for creating a real revolutionary movement, instead of a possible interregnum of four years of Trump’s buffonery. But the Left won’t allow a Trump elected President, so we’ll get revolution from the Left now rather than a right wing one later. Because the politcal right is not revolutionary-yet.

                        It’s not just that it is verboten, it’s that the right wing is generally not known for the desire for a revolutionary radical change to the political and economic orders.  We’re the side who wants a clean and well ordered society (not that we have that now).  Who knows how bad it will have to get before there is a hope of a radical right wing movement.

In fairness to the ZMan, it has to be verboten.
Otherwise the ZMan is gonna end up like Ch@teau He@rtiste.
There are just some topics which you simply cannot poast about on W0rdpre$$, unless you wanna getHe@rtiste’d.

                                    Fair point. That being said, it would be nice if Z, or Pickle Rick, described their idea of what a revolutionary right would look like. Just in theory.I suspect that there are still many on the DR and even on this blog, who imagine something like the return to the old American ideals, which would not be it.

            I wonder if the UK and French elections are a harbinger, or a divergence. UK especially.I’m not nearly as engaged as I used to be, so I could simply be ignorant, but I don’t have a strong feeling about this election, and that usually means status quo, fwiw.At the risk of sounding conceited, I have a feeling I’m a wrecker, which is to say, one of those who, when excited, give the right a disruptive oomph. Conservatives don’t have the energy on their own, nor the desire to actually conserve anything, and probably a fear of mixing it up and winning, a fearful enmity of those who would at least try.I’m not excited, and my sense is those like me aren’t, either.

                It’s impossible to tell if the governments have successfully imported enough foreigners or they have thrown in the towel and are just rigging elections against popular sentiment. It maybe a little of both.For sure, I don’t expect people to be voting their way out of it.

                The UK elections turned out as expected. The UK runs a ‘first past the post’ electoral system – the same as the USA. Voter participation was low, the Labour party won a majority of seats. The Conservatives managed to retain over 100 seats which means they are the official opposition to the Labour party in Parliament and that position gives them special privileges. Essentially, this allows the conservatives to re-group and prepare for power in 5  but more probably 10 years time.The anti-establishment (new) party called Reform – taken over by Nigel Farage collected a respectable share of the electorate’s vote on a national basis but this translates into winning just 6 seats (constituencies). The ‘FPTP’ system is designed to keep Conservatives and Labour in power with smaller parties used to soak up voter frustrations/anger. Nothing will change in the UK, the UK voting public are electorally illiterate. The managerial caste will continue to run government in the UK with little change as a result of this election.This means:Continue with high levels off immigrationContinue to be subservient to the USAContinue supporting war against RussiaContinue supporting war against PalestiniansPrep for war against ChinaPrep to rejoin the EU.Continue to run huge deficitsContinue running a service (F.I.R.E) economy.

        You’ve hit on a weird paradox at the heart of the anti-Trump phenomenon. As much as they pretend to hate him personally, there’s a problem of how they treated him previously, as perhaps amusing and not-quite-our-sort, but still a loveable kind of déclassé rogue. There’s a video of him, pre-fame, going on “Morning Joe” and being feted while being flirty with Zbigniew Brzezinski’s daughter. It really shows the falsity of that whole world (of which Trump was very much a part and in whose good graces he’d probably like to reclaim his spot.)Their hatred of him seems to stem from him actually trying to make decisions—him as a man qua man rather than his personality. There’s another video showing him and Schumer in the Oval Office that’s equally instructive. Schumer is leering like a snake, and telling Trump that if he shuts down the government to get his way on border security, the shutdown will be his fault. Trump says “fine” and Schumer realizes he is screwed. How do you control someone who doesn’t try to deflect or diffuse blame after making it clear (on camera) that the decision was theirs?Their fear of the buck stopping with one person might actually make sense— as a kind of hedge or way to spread risk—if they were as sane as they pretend to be and Trump was as crazy as they depict him. There are a lot of interlocking parts in a modern state, and no one is an expert in every field (the polymath went the way of the dodo in the same century.) But again, the problem is that our experts suck, and so we’re left with this guy with some practical knowledge winging it, making decisions—hiring and firing while getting backstabbed—ad hoc. The best he can do is surround himself with his family, though at least the sneery son-in-law has oozed out of the picture for the time being (Heaven knows what he’s doing in the background, maybe crawling around in the Chabad C.H.U.D tunnels beneath New York.)It’s no way to run a lemonade stand, let alone a country, but the more the system screws up and proves itself feckless and corrupt, the more people will look to individuals as the solution. The system better just hope it gets as lucky again next time as it did this time, since Trump ultimately hasn’t proven himself not that serious or aware, at least until now.

The pain will be worth it if and only if youPREPAREDbeforehand.
Only Preppers will stand a chance of surviving the collapse.
Prepping certainly doesn’t guarantee survival, but failing to prep definitely implies extinction.

            Jared is busy being the face of Anglo-American-Israeli real estate (finance) interests who’ll soon “rebuild” and sell Gaza. He’s been ironically positioned to be the Trump c.1990 character of…whatever they decide to name their new coastal city. Something obscurely obscene. Are there any murderous tzaddiks left uncommemorated? Ukrainian, preferably.Trump’s early fame was as a villain too, but one who wasin the cast. Now he’s a streaker, violating the conceit of the show. He occasionally realizes this, but given any chance—any callback to his comfortable old role—he willfully forgets. He’s old. To assimilate present realities would require him to change. He can’t.This makes him incredibly easy to manipulate. Yet so few do it. Most of the regime is even more detached from reality than he is, and they refuse to compromise with Ultramega Hitler, but for a few it’s a matter of conscious principle. Trump is a designated loser now, and losers areneverallowed to win—or even to think they’ve won.So what I wonder about “They’ve decided to give it to him this time” is: Who did? Whowould? To make Trump president again would require nothing, no action. Let the routine run and watch him win. That’s not what they’re doing.Nobodyis doing that.

                “Imagine being a guy who decides to join MS-13 hoping to turn it into a Catholic charity organization.”What we need it someone willing to wield power in favor of our people even if that person at the top cuts off a few heads.For example with regards to the recent elections in the UK.  Imagine if King Charles was a true patriot (he isn’t, but less just imagine he loved England and was bold)Concerning UK elections:Parliament is dissolved by the King on the Prime Minister’s request……After Parliament has dissolved, a royal proclamation is made summoning a new Parliament, fixing the date when the new Parliament is to assemble, and requiring the issuing of writs of summons to the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and writs of election for the members of the House of Commons.What if the King were to accept the dissolution of parliament, but refuse to summon a new parliament?  Imagine if that King proclaimed all parties traitors to the realm and made public proclamation to the public:“The Globalists have betrayed the United Kingdom.  Protecting the country from invasion is the most basic responsibility of government.  As such I will not allow another parliament to permit the invasion to continue.  I will assume full power as absolute monarch until the invasion has been repulsed.  I call on all military personal, law enforcement officers, and men of good faith to arrest the traitors, and to protect your King from reprisal.Defend your Homeland!Defend your King! ”Don’t give me any counter-argument that its “against the rules”.  Do you think the people who are wrecking us care about the rules?   What matters is power, and the only thing that is going to save us is someone willing to seize it and wield it.

        We just witnessed the theater of democracy in action in France. Just as the ruling elites do over here, those seats in the French parliament which need to be flipped in an “emergency” were handed over to the far left. But sooner or later, these “elite” bastards will end up outsmarting themselves. Handing a box of matches to children is not generally considered to be wise.

                I never got the fascination.  Someone linked to one of his dynamite pieces and just felt like being in an ancient pickup taking backroads across an entire state (and not a small one). At least Ron Unz is just overly verbose, he needs an editor to keep “the point” at the point, but that Moldbug stuff often seemed to not have any point at all.

        The shenanigans happening all over the world to stop a real right from taking power is wild. Just look at France, who pulled all the stops to ensure Le Pen would not gain power, going as far as centrist parties colluding with literal communists.
The we have Germany trying to outright ban AfD.
It’s a wild flailing to delay the inevitable collapse of the current order that simply can not hold. Whatever comes after might be worse, but rest assured the new rulers will have no qualms about using hard power to get their way.

                I agree with your observation and am forced again to ask, “Why is massive non-white immigration their non-negotiable demand?”
The only answer that can explain their fanatical insistence on massive immigration is that those who rule us hate the traditional population and want to disposes us.
If I’m correct, then the question becomes, “Who are ‘they’ exactly?”

        This is why I didn’t really care about and was not surprised by the European elections last week. In the UK the population overwhelmingly rejected the government’s policies, and the first thing the new guy said was that they would continue with the policies of the government. In France, the spiteful mutants teamed up to score a PR victory. The GAE bureaucrats in Brussels and Washington DC run those countries. These shenanigans are a way for the bureaucrats to signal that resistance is futile, that they have infinite power. Except, of course, they don’t. The UK and France are still falling apart thanks to endless third world immigration, and Ukraine still isn’t winning.

I doubt many Labour voters had illusions about the incoming Starmer government. Meet the new boss — same as the old boss. The globalist and the Zionist lobbies in Britain have the country by the balls. Maybe it might have been slightly different if Jeremy Corby were Labour leader. The electoral results were really an expression of dislike for the Conservative governmen, which has been in office for the last 14 years. In every sense of the word Britain is just screwed.

        “One is the system found a way to work around Trump”The same things apparently happened to Carter as well: the system just worked around him. If the president is willing to go along with the “deep state”, fine and good. Otherwise it drags its feet, finds excuses, or just outright ignores him,  One man against a system — it’s just no contest.As I see it an active and energetic president operates as a mediator between the different power centres that constitute the “deep state” — but he cannot take them on collectively. In the case of that worthless pile of crap Biden, he’s not operated as any kind of mediator and the separate power centres have been operating independently and often apparently at odds with one another. Hence the chaos and lack of coherence in policy at the federal level.

            For sure. People forget, but the Beltway types were aghast when Carter brought his crapkickers to DC. Charlie Daniels even played at his inaugural ball. Just imagine. That said, he still put a lot of Deep State types in his cabinet (Vance, Brown) because he realized he had no chance of fighting on all fronts. He ended up out of his depth anyway.

                Ronald Kessler’s book about the Secret Service I think sheds a lot of light on Carter. The Secret Service seemed to like almost everybody it protected except for, predictably, Hillary Clinton and Nancy Reagan. They also didn’t like Carter much. I don’t think they despised Nancy, but they weren’t fond of her either. Carter they despised.

Weren’t Nixon and Reagan also widely hated in DC because they were from the wrong coast?
Reagan also had the additional knock of being a governor who was in charge of one of the most important states in the Union.

                I think that we all underestimate how much the Cloud People, then and now, have viciouspersonalhatreds for each other going back decades, because they are all in that small club. Even when Reagan was an actor, he moved in those political circles, even when Nixon was a new player in 1948, he was in that circle, and that circle is small enough for them to viscerally hate each other face to face for years and years.

                Nixon was supposedly ousted by the “deep state” (though there’s more than one school of thought about this). Reagan I’m not so sure about — the military-industrial complex must have adored him and additionally he was not a hands-on president, particularly during his second term. I also sense that he managed to wed some kind of populism and patriotism with the needs of the deep state. I think every president learns that to “get along you have to go along.” Or else ….

                Reagan talked a good game and I loved him at the time, but he made three critical errors that overshadow much of the good he did: 1) immigration, 2) deficit spending and 3) giving ziocons a seat at the table. Much like Shrub being a decent president but any good that he did was overshadowed by bumbling into Iraq, I think Reagan should also come down a few pegs.

            I was thinking about this yesterday while walking my dog. Clinton brought this massive coterie of freaks, ghouls, and third rate crooks to DC. They came from places like Arkansas and Louisiana, places that the DC natives cannot utter aloud without a sneer. They were not happy with him and did not like him. Yet, by the end of his term, it was Clinton’s town, and it still is. Both him and his wife were fully embraced by the establishment, and those freaks, ghouls, and crooks all became permanent members. They were so fully embraced by the establishment that the establishment was happy to go to war when his wife was denied #herturn. Why is this?

                The Clintons may have been Arkansas hicks but they never vowed or intended to change the status quo a propos the deep state. They may have sneered at him and the hicks he brought along — but these was no hatred. He wasn’t going to take away their rice bowl. Slick Willy was always a chameleon and always willing to “go along in order to get along.” I think — but can’t prove — that one of his signal accomplishments was to join at the hip the Democratic Party and the deep state. The Dem Party today operates as an adjunct of the deep state.

                Clinton’s presidency will be seen, if it isn’t already, as the moment when the South rose again. Money, people, and power have been rushing there since.
Seriously. Cheap third-world labor? Check. Multiculturalism? Check. Free trade? Check. A tottering Union? Check!
Cultural stuff, too. Megachurches (such as they are around here) were just getting started when I was a kid. Young people listen to country music and dress like ranchers and hunters, etc. Not all bad, but undeniable!

        Note also Power Structure buzzwords: collaboration, consensus, conflict resolution, team player, etc. These are concepts for work done by committees in meetings. In such an environment, which became de rigeur sometime after women entered the workforce in force I dare say, there is no room for a strong, decisive, executive leader, i.e. a man. On the contrary, such a thing is frowned upon mightily.This phenomenon scales up, too. As Z says, the presidency is now otiose. AINO is now run by committees of freaks, frauds and femmes. And this piteous outcome has been quite a long time in the making.

            The old man and some of his fellow cadre of retired engineers were enticed ($$$$$$$$) out of retirement back in the late 90’s to fix a complete screw up at Boeing that could have sunk the company. First week back some women tried to round everyone up to celebrate someone’s birthday. They were told to get lost and that they were there to work, not to eat cupcakes. The women, of course, complained to HR and the higher-ups. HR was sent down to straighten these old guys out and get them with the program. They told HR to get lost. The executive higher-ups had to come down and straighten HR out. The executives that told HR to get lost are no longer in charge, so now it’s screw ups all the way down. May you live in interesting times.

                Telling someone to “get lost” when they invite you to a birthday party does not sound like proper behavior to me. You could simply politely decline and say you’re too busy right now. There’s no need to be a jerk about it.

Some little girl in accounting wants receipts (our credit card bill listing charges is insufficient) from his last business trip.  He can write a quarter million dollar check, but she wants a receipt for a highway sandwich.  He recently demanded (and received) a company credit card for business expenses to avoid this female -brained idiocy.

        The president still has his bully pulpit. They haven’t been able to take that away (yet). A sincere reformer (were one ever allowed near the presidency) could and would use it to shine the spotlight on the managerial state that operates unconstitutionally, i.e. when the president orders the troops out of Syria, yet they remain, he could use that bully pulpit to make a huge stink about it and call the mutineers by name. But he didn’t. Just to point at one such example. Same tactic could be applied all across the managerial government. Whether or not this would actually accomplish anything who knows, but the system’s illegitimacy could thus be laid bare for even the densest normie to comprehend.

        How anyone could give a shit about who the president is is beyond me.  My only interest in Trump is the possibility of him winning despite the shenanigans could be the accelerant that leads to the necessary conflict required to rid ourselves of “the kooks”.  Politically it means nothing as no policy will allow to be enforced to do what would need to be done.  We are far beyond any political solution so, in my mind, it doesn’t matter in the slightest.

            The only thing any prez can do that is of real significance is court appointments. Whether those are meaningful enough to bother with electoral politics, however, is debatable.

                Note the aspect of the Court, and the Fed courts in particular, for the ability to move/change things.  The court is exactly what I was thinking about when reading today’s missive.  Can we make a managerial argument for them, or is the judiciary somewhat of the exception?  Certainly, there is a process of appeals and such until the Supremes, but nonetheless one Fed judge can shut down the whole clown show and the Supremes as—Trump molded them—seem to have run against the managerial tide in a few of the major decisions so far.

        This is why I see “soft secession” as the likeliest outcome over the next 10-15 years, and not outright civil war. Of course, a lot can happen, and the Regime seems determined to enact a Battle of Sedan-type disaster that will force massive political changes… but barring that, I’m guessing state governors will start acting like Andrew Jackson vis-a-vis the Supreme Court: “I see Mr. Chief Justice Marshall has made his ruling,” Jackson is said to have said about Indian Removal; “Now let us see him enforce it.” Or, if you prefer, a fake and gay replay of The Fall of the Roman Empire, where the Emperor keeps getting replaced every six months during the Third Century Crisis, and rebellion follows rebellion out in the provinces… but in other provinces, everyone just kinda ignores the so-called Empire, and keeps on keepin’ on as they were before.

            Soft secession, over time, is likely for the same reasons that “hot” civil war is unlikely: complacency, apathy, and comfort. Few if any will be willing to take action to prevent the former or instigate the latter.

                Contrast your“soft secession” with ChetRollins’ comment (It’s a wild flailing to delay the inevitable collapse of the current order that simply can not hold.

            The problem with “soft secession”—which I support as the only workable strategy—has always been the ability of the States to wean themselves from the largesse of the Fed’s.  In every tête-à-têteconflict with the Fed’s, even smallish ones, the States have folded most often when Fed funds are cut off or rather threatened to be cut off.  The Fed’s have their tentacles in every State via the genius of taxing the people in that State and then giving them back a portion as a bribe of sorts for compliance to Fed diktat.

                The Federal Government is more than bankrupt. Either the funds dry up, or the dollar becomes worthless. The, “we’ll cut your funding off” seems like less of a threat than it used to.

                The Feds cutting off funding or even threatening to is pretty much a thing of the past. Some recent court decisions related to that. The “left” can thank themselves for it, re: sanctuary states and funding. I agree with McLeod, the dollar is more likely to become worthless than the Feds are to stop supplying it.

                    The dollar may become worthless, but until then, or its replacement, the problem remains.  I’ve seen no evidence that the Fed’s cannot and do not threaten funding to States.  Hell, it’s written into their (Fed) “grants” which States apply for.  I’m happy to research such if one can point me in the correct direction.

        Good essay. I had to listen to normies during the 4th holiday tell me how Trump is going to change everything this time around, he has learned his lesson they say. The positive thing is the normies realize something needs to change the negative thing is they believe Trump will actually change anything significant.I think France on a macro level tells us where our system is going and California on a micro level shows us how it will probably end up in North America.I would like to be more optimistic but optimism is cowardice in the present age.

            To be an optimist is to pray for a bloody civil war, which is the best possible outcome at this point.
The more pessimistic and likely outcome is a slow quiet decline into extinction.

        “Often, the process of hiring the CEO is about finding someone who will not change anything important…”That’s an evolutionary development that bears more consideration. Z, the last thing you want is a new age Pepsi kid coming in with all the answers to problems the company never had. When those people show up in a company they destroy them. Stuff like Bud Light happens when you get the wrong power players.I repeat: America does not have a systemic problem.The rules, procedures and checks and balances produced the strongest, most powerful nation in history. You (and all the western countries for that matter) – have a people problem. The only thing that will fix it is  busted skulls, stretched necks and blood. At this part a peaceful parting of the ways is impossible. Our adversaries will never be able to feed themselves. That means predation… and they can only feed on people like us. We’ll never be safe with these people behind us or in out midst.The good news is… this only ends one way…

            Yarvin is a throwback. In an age where brevity or 5th grade reasoning prevails, Yarvin writes like a guy from the 19th century…he prefers the long-winded to the concise. In this way he appeals to slow readers, akin to slow eaters, who can’t just sit down for 10 minutes and eat something simple; they need to make the food precious.
And Yarvin is precious, and that’s why people like him or dislike him.

                His initial popularity was among shitlib nerds (because he is one). Thepost-philosophicalleft/”left” was turning against them—directly injuring their careers and lives and reveling in it, years before the noooooticers noticed—so they were frantically seeking respectable opposition.Moldbug was wordy, so he must be smart. His old-reactionary referential palette (Carlyleet al.) didn’t signify conservative or fascist, because nerds don’t know anything about any of those guys. His core keyword was (mis-)appropriated from popular nerd discourse, Eric S. Raymond’s cathedral/bazaar distinction between monopoly and enterprise. Under all the verbiage, Moldbug’s message was that everything should be run like tech companies—before Women In Tech™ took over their management and made them into normal microcosms of society. Moldbug signifiedsafe at hometo nerds.To Peter Thiel it all meant “Peter Thiel should rule the world,” so now Yarvin is rich and his message is“Peter Thiel should rule the world.”

            Moldbug wasn’t “too insider”. Most of his writing was pretentious word salad. That was also his appeal, because his fans felt like they are part of a secret club.
Moldbug was a “nazi” and a “racist”, but once it became known that his real name is Yarvin and that his daddy was a jew working in the US foreign service, he was legitimized by Tucker and other respectable conservatives.

            Yarvin wrote interesting stuff about 15 years ago. But he largely dropped off the ‘Net around 2012 or so. He surfaced again during spring of ’20 during the lockdowns with truly lunatic ideas like cashing everyone out of the stock market. Then he wrote another piece about a year later that I never read. But apparently it was so far off the deep end that a lot of people who liked the guy wondered about his psychological well-being.

            Here are the issues I have with Yarvin.First the good. Yarvin was as far as I know the first guy to begin to mainstream critique of the GAE and to re-introduce ideas by people long shunned and/or forgotten. His ability to admit that America was gone, to describe The Cathedral (managerialism), and bring Schmitt, Burnham, Huntington and others to the fore is a great contribution. Of course, many others have kept alive the more potent critiques and ideas for renewal: Evola; Spengler … …Now for his downsides:He is a merchant plebian who has disdain for the deplorables. He has the same dispicable contempt for the common man as The Regime. He is a non-starter. His whole terminology of hobbits and elves is the anti-thesis of nobility. Nobility is in service of the folk seeking to help them through their limitations, not contemptuous of it and sneering at them.His description of what constitutes an Aristocracy is completely wrong. He describes an already degenerate petite-bourgeoise as aristocratic. I recently talked to one of his acolytes who was legitimately convinced that Kim Kardashian was an aristocrat.He equates a CEO, (a manager), an entrepreneurial CEO, (still a manager in this debt dependent system and a very corrupt one at that), with a Monarch. In other words he proposes no fundamental reform. He thinks everything should be a company run by a CEO.It is this last point that is really bad. In my opinion we are living through the end of a Merchant led Order. Merchants can’t run a civilization and they are not elites. Yarvin doesn’t even get his LOTR metaphor correct. If he had it correct, who he calles the dark elves are really Dwarves. They are greedy, self-interested guys digging around in the dark for more treasure who are only going to accelerate hitting bottom and unleash as yet unforseen demons that otherwise wouldn’t be unleashed.He made his contribution and that can’t be dismissed or discounted. His stammering and stuttering and his almost impenetrable snark are signs something is amiss. When you tolerate them enough to evaluate his premises you see that he is headed for a role as a very minor footnote in the project to restore European Man to glory. Only European men with noble souls will pull this off.If you want a better example, check out the work Scott Mannion is doing at his substack (https://scottmannion.substack.com/). His videos on the Dragonslayer and other topics seem much more promising. If you want to destroy the current Merchant order and put the Merchants back into their rightful place you don’t do it with a hyper-Mercantilist, (Yarvin), you do it with the inheritors and blood kin of the people who once did that with success.

            “what is the problem with yarvin?”
First of all, his writing is offensively verbose and obscure.
But more importantly, he is an IQ civic nationalist.  Like Sailer, he is outside of the current ruling elite, but wants to ingratiate himself to that elite by getting them to bond together over high IQ rather than racial loyalty.  Since only white goys are capable of overriding their tribalism, he is setting up a trap for whites, whether that is his conscious intent or not.
If he succeeds, traditional white Americans will still be dispossessed, just the same as now.

            One other thing is that Dave Green takes Yarvin seriously in that he acknowledges Yarvin’s contribution. It is important for us to be serious people. In the end a guy like Yarvin isn’t our guy. That doesn’t invalidate what he has done that is right and truthful and good. Another good example of this would be James Burnham, the source of much of Yarvin’s valid critique and to Yarvin’s credit he credits Burnham for giving him his critique. Burnham was a man of the Left. However, as an insider as The Cathedral or Managerialism was being constructed in the US, he saw what it was and what it would become. His books on this matter are invaluable. If we dismissed Burnham’s considerable insight and knowledge because he was a man of the Left, and thus not our guy, we would deny ourselves important intellectual capital.We must reserve our in-group preferences for ourselves as does the rest of the world. We must know the friend/enemy distinction and act accordingly. However, we must not ignore truths and insights and resources because the source of them does not come from within our in-group and friend camp.Our blog host does a great job of understanding this and remaining intellectually open and honest.

        This kind of leaderless managerial mass democracy was installed during a time of unprecedented wealth throughout the Western world and in particular in the US. I don’t think this is surprising because the managerial state is really just a kind of autopilot for nations. Autopilots do just fine about 99% of the time too because most of the time nothing much is happening that would require intelligent intervention. The problems is that the 1% of the time you need strong leadership is usually also the time leaving things in the hands of the autopilot leads to disaster.During the last part of the 20th century and early part of this one, people just got used to this idea of letting the autopilot run things. This also allowed political parties to scrap their “bench” system that used to identify outstanding leaders and begin to play around with filling the benches with women and diversity. These changes were embraced because even the “conservative” parties didn’t really want to challenge equalitarian Leftist morality.This carries over into the marketplace too. Part of the love of Teslas and other similar cars is due to a misplaced faith in machines, whether made out of silicon or bureaucratic cogs. People still want to just press the button and let the computer run things. The problem is that, if the US and its Euro-puppets are a Tesla, it is now driving against the traffic at 150 mph. The passengers may be screaming but there’s no one in the car who still knows how to drive.

        The end game for a managerial state is to be ignored by the people. Rules, regulations, and laws are ignored once you’re outside the shining city’s walls. This is how the rest of the world, outside the West, lives, and it’s how the West will live going forward.

        The scale and complexity of Empire make it difficult for any Executive to have a positive impact. This is a feature, not a bug, of the System. Every President since Eisenhower has understood this. We’re now at the end stage wherein the insiders attempt to run things without even observing the formalities of republican democracy. This might be feasible if they were willing to accept even minor feedback from the plebes. But they aren’t.

        Out of 34 Senate seats Real Clear Politics has 8 listed as “toss ups.”  That includes Ted Cruz’s seat, which does not appear to be close. The rust belt Democrat seats they are including are polling within the margin of error, but somehow the Democrats will manage to pull them out.The one thing that is surprising is how many members of Congress hang on until death.  If they are just playing a part, why not get out of there and enjoy of few years of living high on the hog without having to go to endless meetings, fundraisers, etc.  It may be a Joe Paterno mindset where some of them feel like this is what gets them out of bed every morning and if they retire they will die.

            Most of them start down that road with a sincere desire to “serve,” or “make things better,” or “make a difference,” or more recently, “change the world.” Because they become corrupted over time, and not all at once, there is likely never a moment when they realize they have become the problem. Even at the end of it all, they still believe they are “doing some good,” and if they gave up their seat, they would be opening the door to some corrupt self serving person. So they hang on, by whatever means necessary. The moral trade offs and integrity compromises they make along the way are just what’s necessary to “serve the people.” Of course after a while there have been so many of them that any civic spirit that once existed is buried beneath them, but that can be hard for the individual to see.

                I think the civic minded were weeded out by the cynical reality at the very start, and those that went on are afraid of those coming up behind them.  They’re trapped, unable to let go and enjoy what’s left.

            Actors stay on stage, any stage, until, they can no longer physically get on the stage. Most of the people in elected office are actors recruited because they can effectively play the role and love playing it. There was an old joke about John Kerry that the most dangerous place in Washington was between Kerry and a TV crew setting up a live shot. His nickname was “live shot” for this reason.There is a genius to the system. Since actors will always outperform non-actors in the democratic system, the economic elites simply move to the production side of the house. As long as everyone is getting work and the big bosses are making money, the system is resilient to  even the worst box office flops.

They’d rather be in the Senate Barber shop than at Sunday dinner with the hag they married. Besides they can grab some pussy on the side and use the government slush fund to payoff the slut in question before the book comes out.

                “On the side”. I don’t know these days, but the few politicians I did close protection work for (not in the capacity of on-site, close-body security), they had blackbooks just for that. Nothing illegal, but screening “Candi” and “SinDy” twice a night for a week straight was amusing.

This line may be better than your remark a few months ago comparing Vivek Ramaswamy to a call center supervisor.

        Congress hasn’t mattered much ever, since they can always be bribed or intimidated..The only groups that matter are the bankers and the large industrialists…The last President who seriously interfered with the bankers was Andrew Jackson, who ended the corrupt Bank of the United States..He only escaped assassination on the steps of Congress when the assassin’s gun misfired twice, a near miraculous occurrence…These two groups passed the Morrill tariff, precipitating the Civil War, and pushed  America into WW1, another ruinous event for the American population..Fortunately, they haven’t yet decided that WWIII is a good idea…..

They’re trying damn hard to get a third entry into the franchise, though. The playbook is reminiscent pre-WW2 and getting either Japan or Germany to take the bait. Fortunately, neither Russia nor China have fallen for it. Yet.

            One cares I suppose when one leaves this clown world and travels to another world, perhaps not so clownish.  When a Putin speaks of dangerously escalating conflict with NATO and specifically the US and then laments an inability to negotiate peace because he does not know whom to talk to.  Yeah, I’d say this is disconcerting in the nuclear age.

        Interesting title Z. Over the weekend i caught a Jason Stratham movie called “The Bee Keeper.” Stratham starts out as literally a bee keeper. But shit happens and he comes out of retirement to kick asses. Turns out he was a retired “bee keeper. Later in the movie Jeremy Iron’s who’s a high level govt / corporate player explains to the presidents son (president is a woman of course) who the president has chaged Iron’s character to act as the kids advisor, that he has upset the corporate / political order, by scamming old people out of all their money, and bee keepers exist to keep the corporate / political order in a state of balance and the kid upset that balance. The bee keepers are called such, because in a bee hive a drone will kill the queen if she produces weak offspring which threatens the health of the hive. So the system maintains these bee keepers, agents, who have unlimited funds, access to all manner of weaponry, information etc who decide of their own volition to take out powerful people or organizations who’s actions may threaten the order of the system “the hive.” So your title today had me thinking if you had seen this movie. The movie sucked except Stratham was his usual, stoic ass kicking self. With all the FBI agents, who are trying to stop Stratham from doing his job are the usual cast of woke approved minorities, a black woman who drops F bombs every other word, a black man is assistant FBI director, a Pajeet, and an hispanic woman. Zero white men in the FBI.

        This ^^ is pretty much identical to the plot line in the excellent book, “The Vicar of Christ.” In the book a new pope USES the power of the papacy to effect serious change. The new pope is an odd duck – American Korean war hero, becomes CJ SCOTUS… then winds up as the pope (no more spoilers in the event you decide to read it). And he blows up the place, draws YUGE crowds wherever he goes… It’s pretty much what Trump is trying to do… Author is a former prez of Notre Dame, as I understand it. HIGHLY recommended read; right along Trump’s vector…

        Trumpism as absurdism is an underrated strand in the times. It fits the mood and the professionalization apocalypse. I think Brandon is clever to cop the absurdist albeit reckless techniques of his doppelganger. Contrast with Michael Tracey complaining about an encounter initiated with MAGA oddfellows in a Speakers Corner type situation in Bucks County. He said they were cult followers, they said they didn’t agree. He said well this proves it (something Gaza haha) and they said no. Then new Diogenes rends his garments and proclaims his interlocutors mentally ill. Very 2024 scene.

        If we don’t do something soon to rein this all in, powerful Rightist groups like the Patriot Front will only get stronger. When that happens the real insurrection may come and it will probably be the bloodiest and most brutal in history.

            I’ve not seen pictures, but am skeptical of all those folks who “dress the part” for the cameras.  LARPers abound.  The work of those who truly make change is often dirty and unrewarding and they certainly desired to remain unpublicized in our current repressive environment.

            “Powerful far right groups” like the 50 guys LARPing with their newly pressed 100% wrinkle free Confederate and Colonial Flags. Walking in the middle of the street bothering nobody. They are definitely 100% legit and nobody in that group glows brighter than the sun.If this was a clever attempt at sarcasm I apologize in advance, but my feeling is it wasn’t as you played it way too deadpan.So if it is NOT sarcasm than it is a reminder why glowies continue doing these absurd Patriot Front style things because it strikes “concern” into the heart of normies like David Wright and sheer terror and panic into leftists. I often struggle with the fact that half the population are to the left of midwits on the bell curve, then I read these posts and am reminded just how easy it all is now for them.

        And yet, does Z have any writing critical of Yarvin outside of some minor niggles? Please, someone point me to it. How do their ideologies even differ at the root, being anti-democratic and technocratic in nature, imho? The main article of Z I could find felt less like criticism and more like pining for more of Yarvin.It might be popular for conservatives to hitch to Yarvin today but in the manufactured dissident right, it’s seems popular to renounce him for street cred, without ever giving any tangible criticism. And here we are: easy content to consume that feels right but goes nowhere.Whitney Webb has done good work connecting Yarvin to intelligence, yet Z seems to strongly renounce such things as “conspiracy theories” when discussed generally or in possible relation to his connections. Funny, that.Abandon democracy, plebs! Don’t rebuild your institutions! Submit to the demoralized panopticon I present you! Support “outsider” Drumpf (again) (please)!
