        Small bone to pick, but I don’t think enforcing/protecting the border is a terribly difficult problem to fix either. Col. MacGregor brings this up a lot, but the US Army protected the Mexican border for over 100 years up until 1948. They did this job very effectively. Bring home a fraction of the troops we have in bases abroad and it can be done again with the stroke of a pen.

        The congressman you mentioned people asking you to do a show about is James Traficant. Exposed some corruption, got imprisoned, died weirdly. The thing he did that really got him in trouble was defending not-really-Nazis (in one case a guy exonerated by Israeli courts) against deportation by the OSI for show trials in Germany. When I was a kid so much of the daily news was about elderly German men being shipped around the world to be tortured, I remember all their names.

            The Ernst Zundel affair was shocking and disgraceful! Canada, the U.S., and Germany all had a hand in it, and he wasn’t even a concentration camp guard or anything. Just asked the wrong questions about The Holocaust.

                The United States has been an evil entity for a long, long time. Looking at this blast from the past is a heartbreaking reminder of the period before there was a full transition into totalitarianism (although it seemed all but inevitable even back then).I don’t know as a certainty whether Traficant did anything illegal or not and kind of doubt he did based on how corrupt the police state apparatus is; his statements here certainly are eloquent and light years beyond the dry political recitations of today. Given that, I actually don’t care what he did, if anything. I will say as a certainty that regardless of whatever merits Traficant was expelled and imprisoned because of the wicked Puritans and Jews and their sycophants. A day of reckoning surely awaits them and it cannot come soon enough.May they burn in hell.

        Look, let’s stop beating around the bush. Trump was the last shot at option #2. Look what they’ve done to him, and are still continuing to do to him. The only option left, is the founding fathers round 2. Please for fucks sake just say it… bloody revolution is THE only option.

            I don’t personally want revolution because I don’t want most of this country’s citizens as my countrymen.  If even 10% of Americans hate white people and/or believe in trans children, I’d rather we have several secessions and break this land mass up into European sized countries to avoid those people.  50 border walls and 50 trade deals with some military agreements in case the continent is invaded would be a better option than living under some Afrocentric, transgender, socialist empire.  The sunk cost fallacy is what keeps boomers hanging on because their daddies saved america from nazism or something.  Conservatives are fighting for a meritocracy while leftists are building a black supremacist society and culture with gay undertones.  Our best chances of preserving anything are to cut off and separate the cancer.  Maybe we can reconquer in a century or two after we’ve regrouped.

                    Since the USSR. Bloodshed was minimal. Certainly not the bloodbath that would occur in an AINO counterrevolution or civil war 2.0.

                    Czechoslovakia?  Malaysia/Singapore?  I’m not trying to be a contrarian, just to point out that it can happen.Of course we already have experience going down this road and the Yankees flew into a violent rage, destroyed the South, enacted a punitive rebuilding program on top of that, and finally, a century later, wiped out the culture of that land.  And given the actions of the GAE in this century, it’s safe to say that Washington has lost none of its taste for enforcing its morality at the point of a gun, but I don’t think that with today’s gynocentric ruling class a Civil War style beatdown is probable today.  That’s especially true if steps toward separation are taken piecemeal.Using the left’s tactic of sanctuary laws can allow clusters of like-minded counties or regions within states to thwart the ruling class ideology.  Follow that up with rearranging state lines to better match demographics (is there any precedence for a national government forcing localities to remain within preexisting borders?).  Move on to nullification of federal laws.  And finally just break away.  If these steps are taken one at a time and normalized before each click of the ratchet, we can boil the frog.

                        I’ve also thought about the conservative version of a sanctuary city.  Honestly, the gop must be in on the game.  If I was governor, I’d ban government housing and immigration instantly on a state level and see what the federal government might do.  We’d see a diaspora of blacks and immigrants fleeing to go live on welfare in some otherblue state.  Hell I’d blame it on budget cuts and call myself a libertarian.  There’d be a drop in violent crime by about 70%, suddenly the downtowns will be safe again, and students grades will mysteriously be higher.  You can’t tell me no white governors know this.  After the initial trail of tears, They’d be heroes.  So either they’re all pussies or they’re making money to pretend like they want to stop crime in their states and cities.    Or maybe both. I think they get a big check from DC for every new welfare recipient.  Dante had something to say about traitors.

                        Davidcito, perhaps you’ve noted the little dust-up, which has mostly gone away (imagine that), about misuse of federal welfare funds in Mississippi. I sense that Mississippi isn’t the only place where this happens. State governments are given great autonomy in how to manage those funds. So the local pols siphon it off for whatever they want. As happened in Mississippi. Where they are happy to let Brett Favre be the public fall guy while most of the (many) other people involved get their names lost down the memory hole.

                Great in theory, in practice, you will NOT be allowed to peacefully separate so revolution is your only play.The gibs getters are WELL aware of their inability to function without Whitey which is why every lever of power is used to control him and keep him under the boot.Free association which is basically what you are describing was killed in the 1960s and it ain’t coming back anytime soon. Why on Earth would they allow you to separate knowing that all the productive people would immediately flee to the Whitopia.Whenever it ends, it will be in total subjugation or in blood. There is no other path forward.

External pressures (war, economic hardship, globalists who don’t care if the US rules the EU or the other way around because they’re set either way) may make this all moot. A mass surveillance state with mandatory crypto that would make China blush is clearly another possibility.
(I’m an option 2 kinda guy.  But it won’t be pretty for the masses, unless it’s by sheer accident.)

            The second is most likely. This is what happened with the American Revolution. Unless I misheard or misunderstood, Z indicated the AR represented the third option. The Founders represented one set of Clouds who faced off against and even cloudier set of Clouds. Maybe they had nothing left to lose after a point, but it started out as an elite factional squabble.

Tell me exactly how the Founders were not a dissident elite.
The American Revolution was not a peasant revolt. Like all elite civil wars, peasants were cannon fodder.

        The Choices;1. Wait and see what happens: Most of Asia have been slaves for 2000 years because the side that shows up – the system- wins by default.  We see what happens now – now is what happens.Forever.2.  Elite defections – already happening.3.  CW2 (Civil war 2);  this is possible as we have Elite defections (Musk is not alone) .  Also possible as the system has not only lost its army and police, it seems to have lost vigor of execution outside of its core organ of repression and security: The Media.   The Media you see has become the core organ of compliance and repression and indeed the only ones left with any commitment- certainly their prospects in life outside of the Bourgeois niche of court assassins are greatly limited.  The Intelligence Community of course courted the Media and no doubt shaped their coverage from WW2 1940 until at least after Watergate, but the Apprentices outlived the sorcerers.   This is all good for the rest of us – because the media has no army or police, nor physical courage.  Their power was to move politicians….who are dying.DC by the way Dies with Biden.  He is the last President.  That’s why all the talent has fled and a She Ape is White House SpokesCritter, its all ending in a whimper.   Any talent or sanity has fled, you have stupidity and senility playing out the last hand.  The end of DC isn’t the end of the matter but that collapse is the beginning of the war for America.   War it will be.   This isn’t 1989 or 1789, its 1911 Qing China and Biden is the Old Buddha.

        Dan Bongino has a huge national following, and for the most part, says a lot of good stuff. But his foundational mantra is that we can and must vote our way out of the mess we’re in. He will not (really cannot) alter this imperative until he and his family are loaded onto the boxcar. And he is a big reason why normie stays on the couch.Russia today is a far better place to live than the USA. The Soviet Union collapsed overnight, the 90s were pure Hell, along came a strong leader and it took 2 decades to right the ship. That is our best case outcome. You can be a spectator or a participant.If the latter, then there is a smart way to go about it. It starts with survival and anonymity. There will be Jackboots and they will be ruthless. But all of that menace &amp; might is helpless against the bolt-from-the-blue. There are millions of tradesman, deliverymen, maintenance men, and similar nobodies circulating endless through society on a daily basis. They are everywhere all the time. They possess unique knowledge and access. And most of all, they are largely unnoticed and far too numerous to offset with typical Gestapo tactics.And everything solely within the confines of your cranium.

            Matt, I suspect you are an engineer or similar profession, as am I. I recently attended an economic/investment forum in which an engineer who made out well with startups gave the keynote speech, which focused on why deflation is necessary for a successful future for America’s economy. It was fascinating watching an engineer wade into the world of economics.He was erudite, articulate, and his speech was laden with charts and graphs that proved his point. And he is completely correct. But he could not contemplate the possibility that there exists a class of (((bankers))) who don’t give two hoots about ensuring a successful future for America’s economy. It was beyond his (engineer brain) capacity to imagine a system that is designed to extract as much  wealth from the host as possible, even if it destroys the host in the end.From the perspective of the elites, there is no “immigration issue” to solve. Or perhaps more accurately stated, the only immigration issue to solve is how to open the border even wider. They accrue all the benefits and incur none of the costs.It is genuinely hard to try to rewire your brain to understand how they think, particularly for engineer types who are conditioned to think along the lines of utility. We are but cattle to them.

            I concur with Guest’s comment above and add that the kind of organization that you mention has existed for decades:  Numbers USA.  (VDare gets second place.)Numbers USA has done great work.  I have sent hundreds of faxes through their site to politicians over many years.In accordance with Guest’s comment, I invite you to ponder why the work of Numbers USA has been fought at every turn and yielded so little progress.Finally, research who funded the decades-long struggle to pass the 1965 immigration act and who speaks most passionately in favor of open borders (for white countries only!) today.

        Peasant revolts don’t really exist. It’s always a faction among the elites that senses an opportunity to get ahead and uses populism, to do it. That includes sending the peasants to do the fighting.
That is why protests are not going to work until they have support from someone who is part of the elites, but currently plays second fiddle within the existing system. Trump could have been that person, if he were much younger and much smarter.

            The only time protesting ever works if you are protesting for the government to do something they already want to do.  They aren’t really protests so much as they are PR stunts by the elite.Take “Just Stop Oil” and all of their ridiculous shenanigans!  Like it’s the elite who want to keep the status quo and the unwashed masses really doesn’t want to drive anymore because in a 100 years the average global temp might go by 2 degrees.This is why so many of these protestors and antifa and anarchists groups are made up of the kids of the rich and powerful.  Their parents are too old to don a costume and march in the streets.

                This is exactly right. As much as people bang on France, it actually does allow protests against state policies (to be clear, the protests usually are ignored). The United States never has allowed such protests and never will. For confirmation, see the Alien and Sedition Act, the New York Draft Riots, the Espionage and Sedition Act, and basically any civil dissent today. The much-vaunted “civil rights protests” are a classic example of American policy disguised as dissent. The state-sponsored terrorism of the BLM riots in 2020 were just a more violent example.The United States–by far–has been the most successful totalitarian entity in history up until recently. Expect it to become far more vicious and bloodthirsty as power drains from it. I’m glad Z gave the disclaimed that repercussions are likely if people protest this garbage police state.

                    Good questions, and I have thought about them. The most likely answer seems to be these were simple arguments over who should be management. The Tribe with ‘Nam and the Left with Iraq were opposed only because they wanted the power and lucre and were not in the position to get bigger slices of the pie. In other words, these were inner Regime squabbles because both of those groups are key parts of the power structure and they were temporarily junior partners, which was untenable. It was especially galling that the Vichy Right was the titular head of the Iraq and whites generally of the ‘Nam campaigns. This is how and why both easily became proponents of Ukraine, to give the most recent example. They are in the catbird seat now and it is win-win for them.

                        An afterthought and historical illustration since I earlier referenced the Espionage and Sedition Act.Woodrow Wilson truly did initially oppose entry into World War I. He genuinely opposed imperialism, as did most of his cabinet, notably William Jennings Bryan. Wilson later was persuaded, unfortunately correctly, that he could implement the Administrative State using war powers in the same manner as Lincoln. So a war he first opposed became one he could embrace when it caused more power to accrue to him. Byran, incidentally, resigned immediately over it. It is utterly predictable with the GAE that an honorable man like Bryan would be demonized by leftwing historians and Wilson praised until the latter became untenable as facts about him became more widely known. Even with his shitty failings I’m not a default Wilson knocker, to be clear, since his views on race were true and accurate.

                        I think the greater likelihood is that when America was nominally rightwing, it didn’t have the stones to crush the domestic Left. OTOH, now that America has transitioned to AINO, it has no compunctions whatsoever about liquidating the right. Occam’s razor comes into play here.

That’s a more succinct version of what I wanted to convey. I would quibble that the actual Right has controlled anything since WWII but that would descent into semantics. But, yeah, who is in charge is all that matters.

        That was a solid show and conclusion. Well done.I think the politics while not unrelated are a secondary issue to the survival and well-being of European people. I know I have done a lot of thinking and meditating in trying to get myself to let go of the outcome while maintaining the will to help my family navigate this reality.The reality is they may not be willing to care. Or, they may care very much, but unwilling to do what it takes to walk away from the garbage dump and feed on the wholesome heritage and cultivate themselves. They may be willing but not up to that investment.Still, I will do what I can and support my family first, but also anyone I know who does look in the mirror and say, ‘I want I future that looks and lives like me and that honors my long and illustrious past of those who came before.’I know I have been fortunate to participate in the dying remnants of European high culture – directly connected to the lineage due to interest, talent and hard work. I will do what I can to preserve that knowledge, and most importantly, that energy that only comes from direct connection to the tradition. It may be of service, it may end up circling the drain. What matters is that I have faith and do my very small part.The best takeaway from this show is the acknowledgement that we are fundamentally powerless unless we are willing to risk it all. The Cloud people will decide the direction. Only the limits of reality will determine how far and how long they go, and what opportunities reality’s walls may present when or if they are dazed and confused and weakened by bumping into it.Have a great weekend everyone. May we all find peace, yet never give up on yourself, your family and our folk.

        For most of us here the best course of action is to make a plan to get out as soon as practicable. I count five members of the Mayflower Compact as ancestors, as well as immigrants from the 1800s. My ancestors have fought in every war up to the fiasco in Iraq. I grew up a flag-waving, red-blooded American from the rural Midwest. No longer.My kids see the writing on the wall. One of my children has emigrated with no intent ever to return. Another plans to leave in a year or two. I will follow as soon as I can retire. My parents are elderly, but still in good health. My only dilemma is whether I can leave them behind, as I don’t believe they will leave at their age.

That’s not me being glib, either.

                The important thing for most of us here to grasp is that we no longer have a country, and to respond in kind. Most of us here have pledged our loyalty to America for a lifetime, and have been rewarded with a boot in the face, metaphorically speaking. That deal’s off the table–time to be a free agent.A lot of people here seem to be looking for a place that was like America in the 1980s or 1990s, but the red pill is that world no longer exists and never will again. It’s lost to history, like the dinosaurs. It was a unique period in history and we were fortunate to live through it, but it’s over. Demographics is destiny. There’s no point in trying to fix or restore America anymore. America will, inevitably, become Brazil.No place is perfect, but there are a lot of places better than Brazil. For me, this will be a move into retirement, or at least semi-retirement. I don’t know if I will select a permanent home country immediately or simply try living in a few different places for a while. Parts of central Europe and the Balkans are interesting options, as are parts of South America. I’m looking for a low crime, high trust society that is relatively ethnically homogenous (I’m fine with being a minority) and has a reasonable cost of living and access to the recreational activities I enjoy.

                        There does seem to be a cycle in Latin America where the low-IQ Mestizo masses periodically use their ballots to vote in some sort of Mariachi Band Marxist government headed by some barrio thug like Chavez. These guys invariably steal everything they can for their extended families and attack whatever islands of competent people and productive industry exist to buy tortillas and tequila for the natives. Then the military steps in and restores a brutal sort of order. This at least gets inflation under control, brings back foreign investment, and convinces the remaining upper middle class to cancel their flights to Miami. Given the demographics this is probably a best case scenario for California right now. I must admit I will enjoy watching the Rainbow Democracy there burn.

                        One of the things that is killing the emergence of a proper government is the idiot Reagan’s “government is the problem, government is too big”, etc.The Left seeks State power to use it. When the current weak sauce Right approaches power, they shrink from it or try to attenuate it.Of course, this all comes from May 8, 1945, et seq., and the chances that the situation is recoverable are small.

                    Kauhajioki Finland. Almost entirely white, lots of outdoor activities, plenty of meat eaters, religion largely Lutheran, language is difficult to learn tho.
There’s this game called if you put 100 Finns on an island and come back in 10 years, or if you put 100 “Other Race Here” on an island for 10 years what would you find. If Finns, the first thing they would do is construct a sauna, then a church, then a school.

                    Chile has some German immigrant enclaves I understand are great places to live. Few months ago I saw a documentary about Namibia that is a very scarcely populated country with a lot of issues, but they showed a small village populated by German colonizers in the middle of nowhere and the place looked like an upscale suburban place in the US with luxury German cars and modern homes.Demographics is destiny, but a white pill is that local concentration works, just need a country that does not give an F about freedom of association and you can build Germany-kanda in Chile or Namibia.I understand the south of Brazil is mostly European and that’s why they have advanced industry like aerospace and car manufacturing. So I bet Brazil has some good enclaves if you know where to look. When FEDimerica collapses we will be able to build enclaves here too so maybe keep your US passport and you may be able to retire from “diversity” in some places of the US with no FEDs bothering you.

                        Chile is on my list. Parts of Argentina are worth looking at also. Some have demographics that are quite comparable to the US. A lot of Germans, including former not sees, decamped to Chile and Argentina. Good neighbors.
Can ski in the winter, mountain bike and hit the beach in the summer. Cost of living is quite reasonable. Life looks pretty good there.

                    I live in Argentina, a third world country, but… I’ve been here nearly 20 years and here I stay. I live in a rural village in the center of the country, mild climate, pure air, beautiful, friendly (I’m bilingual), but now very expensive property-wise owing to urban flight. No racism, none (I’m NW European, a slight minority if at all). No afro-descended within a hundred miles. Keys left in car, house unlocked, honest merchants, high trust once earned. Dollars go a long way. The key is learning the language of the place to which you might move and spending six months or more before deciding to make a purchase unless you become convinced more quickly. And, of course, one must meet income and/or capital requirements to obtain permanent residency. Best of luck in your search!

                Exactly. The Balkans and South America are more politically corrupt than we are. You can’t decamp to white South Africa as you could in the 1960s. And it’s not as if you can just go to Canada like the draft dodgers did in the Sixties, either. Castro’s gay bastard son isn’t exactly an improvement over the left-wing nutjobs here in the U.S.Frankly, we’re in the exact same position the earliest Christians were in (before two millennia of bullshit about incense and robes and fish on Friday got heaped on top of Christianity).Like them, we reject a global empire that is completely corrupt, yet holds total power, even the power to kill us at will. Like them, there is nowhere for us to go, perhaps all we can do is simply refuse to go along with the program. And if they kill us… then they kill us. maybe we need to accept that dying for the truth is better than living a lie.

                        I am generally against one-liner comments because they are devoid of content, but yours is an excellent pithy comment that eviscerates roughly seven centuries of Protestant thinking. What a mess we’ve made.
Christianity has run its course, largely due to Protestantism, and the only organized religion that can save us now is Islam. If you had told me 30 years ago that I would write these sentences in the future, I would have have punched you in the face.
May God bless you few remaining dedicated Catholics. The Church has recovered from moral corruption before. Let’s pray it will again.

                        Guest,
The Catholic Church is not the only game in town for those who wish to be Christians who have a deep well of tradition upon which to draw. I give you Russian Orthodoxy, which qualifies in that regard, and has demonstrated that adherence to the faith in that tradition has enabled them to endure both the Mongol Yoke, as well as 7 decades of persecution by the communists, and still come out the other side, scarred for sure, but also tempered. The “third party” of Christianity, if you will.

The rest of the world is not your future suburb. I will concede that children and young adults who have not been corrupted by this evil system might be candidates to emigrate as long as they know their place in the new destination.

                    “I will concede that children and young adults who have not been corrupted by this evil system might be candidates to emigrate as long as they know their place in the new destination.”Well, that rules out pretty much everyone.  We are exposed to non-stop propaganda before we are even old enough to speak.  By the time a kid is 5 years old, they’ve been subject to at least a thousand hours of propaganda.  How many 4 year olds replay Disney tapes (well blu ray disks today) 40 times?  They have the words to propagandistic songs memorized from sheer repetition. If they weren’t in “day school” they probably were propped in front of TV to watch Sesame Street for a couple of hours a day from the time they were 2 years old.If they are 12, you can just add 6 more years of full time propaganda exposure in school.  Who knows how much sexual degeneracy they are exposed to in school now that 5 and 6 year olds get an introductory to sex ed.   Any people who let us and our kids into their country are fools.We need to fix home and stop running. Everyone ran from the cities back in the 60s-90s.  All that accomplished is a few decades of relative peace but at the cost of losing our cities. Now that they’ve consolidated the power in the cities, they’re coming for the burbs.  Their power over the cities is extremely damaging in and of itself.

                        Tars:  In yet another illustration that “there is nothing new under the sun,” hearken back to the biblical tale of the Israelites wandering in the desert for 40 year until those with the slave mentality died off.  I have suggested before that we will need something similar in any White ethnostate – fairly draconian laws and punishments for those who denigrate White people, history, or culture.Even amongst those who theoretically desire to live with their own people there are far too many who have been poisoned by feminism, liberalism, egalitarianism, etc.  Those who have been raised on rap and blaq dance styles and overt sexual displays and animalistic hedonism will need to be reined in – good and hard.  White people will need to relearn White pride and behavior, as well as the time and place for confidence vs humility.  And women need to be retaught modesty and privacy and femininity.

                You are what we call a keyboard warrior. I have a few years to retirement so most likely by then you will have stormed the walls, taken down this corrupt regime, and replaced it with a legitimate, functioning government so I won’t have to leave. Got get ’em, Bonzo. I thank you in advance.
Demographics is destiny. America, to the extent it continues to exist as a single polity, will become Brazil. The demographic war is already lost. There’s no point in fighting battles.

                        Not a boomer.Tell me, Mr. internet tough guy, precisely what did YOU do to prevent the slide into our current situation? The answer is not a damn thing. You’re every bit as conquered as the rest of us are, and you didn’t fire a shot either. None of us did.And what are YOU going to do to try to right the ship? The answer is, again, not a damn thing. Or more accurately, you will write some strongly worded comments thumping your chest on the Zblog. That will certainly get the job done.Let me know when you’ve invented a time machine, traveled back in time, and defeated the passage of the 1965 Immigration Act that fostered the change in American demographics. Until then, you really have nothing but keyboard warrior comments to offer.Like the rest of us here, you don’t have a country to fight for anymore either. Your country hates you and wants you dead. In my opinion, the best response to that situation for most of us here is going to be to leave the country that hates you and look for a place that likes you, or at least is modestly indifferent to your existence. If you have a counterargument, then make it. If not, then shut the hell up. Internet tough guys like you are ridiculous clowns.

                    Really Guest. Let’s run away. Abandon the greatest country in the history of the World? The best governing principles for the majority.If America goes much of the world goes with it.Reagan was right; we are a beacon on a hill. We have been what is possible under the right conditions.We are a Judeo Christian based culture and society. The individual is sacrosanct. That is the foundation of our system… the individual. We are the only one.I left Cali. When it was sliding in the ditch in the 90’s, That was a mistake. I should have stayed and tried to fix it before it was too late.We need to Americanize our new people and teach them what made us prosperous. It wasn’t welfare and medicade.The idea of America is too important to quit. The opportunity and responsibility for the individual has been an exponential improvement to the human race.Hardship and suffering will bring the social and political will to fix our once great Nation. There are a lot of smart people who want a funcional and good America. Once we get poor enough we will unf**k our current mess. Hunger is a great motivator.If we give up the outcome is certain.I hope you enjoy Costa Rica, it’s a nice third world country.

                        My point is there is no where else to go. Cali is gone.When things colapse at least we have a templete of what is possible.In our modern nuclear armed planet I suspect the next period will be back in the caves, having wiped out 10,000+ years of human history with it.Having a doomed perspective is not helpful regardless of accuracy.Trying to fix things locally is the only hope. We are in for one he11 of a rough ride in the near future as we are facing an economic and social colapse that are alligning to happen together and on a world wide scale. All countries are bankrupt now. This is a new phenomena in history. Yeah globalism! We are in a heap oftrouble and it was our own doing.

                        Hate to pile on, but the reality is we never were a “beacon on a hill” except in the sense to stay the f*ck away or you will be destroyed.  First, Democracy is the worst form of government, including all the rest.  It relies on the asinine theory that the collective intelligence of idiots is somehow something other than idiotic.  Second, even if in theory democracy was “good”, democracy does not scale up beyond maybe 4 or 5k people.  Beyond that, you need financial sponsorship and organization which leads to oligarchical rule.  Third, the masses are too easily swayed by the Latest Thing, and have been lied into every major policy decision since at least the Spanish-American war.  You can  list on one hand with five fingers to spare the number of times the US government has spoken the truth.

            Escape Brazil Norte by moving to Brazil Brazil?All those Latin countries stability is dependent on a strong USA keeping them in line, and bringing them money.If the USA “collapsed” into Brazil Norte, that influence would vanish. And the Gringos would be chopped up into liver pie. OR, in less violent areas, just forcibly be fully assimilated into the mestizo culture (aka becoming a peasant living in poverty with mestizo kids).Europe is on the same trajectory as everybody else. But with lower native birth rates and higher migrant birth rates. I quite honestly think the USA is the optimal place to be.

                In the USA, where Whites will soon make up less than 50 percent of the population, there are still 200 million White people.  That’s not insignificant.  As a comparison, in 87 percent White America, 1970, there were 175 million Whites.
I don’t know exactly what this means for the future, but there are still a lot of Whites in America.

                    Yeah. Only Russia and (surprisingly) Brazil will have anywhere near the same volume of White people that America does. And even then it’s not even close.
Whereas 24 million Whites in Canada – 18 million in Australia  – 27 million Indians are born per year. So easy to flood small countries.

                        US is much more diverse than Europe, and there are a lot more whites in Europe than the US and Canada combined.
TFR for US whites is about the same as whites in Europe so not sure about your theory.
Much of Europe is less American than the US eg abortion laws so again not sure Europe is dumber and gayer.

                    While true, there are Whites, and then there are “whites”.  What percentage of the 200m are essentially race traitors?  If Whites voted in 90%+ blocks for their own collective interest like some other groups do, your point would be more valid.

            Before the plandemic, I had a nice long list of potential destinations. That exposed most of them as no better, or as worse. Mexico remains viable. One of the very few that retained its sanity. Coincidental that it is close by. There are a lot of trade offs. You can’t bring your guns, for instance. Services are worse. And if you think corruption is bad in AINO….. This is before we get into the trend toward North America merging into one country, kind of like the EU, for which the groundwork is being laid. But you would be freer there (other than the firearms situation), at least for now.Long story short, it’s now hard to find anywhere that is clearly better than red state AINO.

            Demographics is destiny is only true to an extent and mostly in different circumstances.  Most of the non-Americans in America walked here and they can walk home.  Almost all of them hold foreign citizenship, their children have foreign citizenship.  Children of Mexicans born anywhere in the world are Mexican under Mexican law.  Mexico would absolutely LOVE to get back the smart ones who have been educated and acculturated in America.The Moors were kicked out. Muslims were kicked out of India.  The Chinese are showing the way with the Uighurs.  Some SE Asian country (Malaysia maybe) have kicked out the Muslims who are crying genocide.  We even have examples in America, like operate wetback and tossing the Japs into concentration camps in the 40s.Demographics is destiny is defeatism.  None of these people were here before us. Most have been here only a single generation. Nearly all hold foreign citizenship.  Sending them home is a matter of political will, it is not fate or destiny to be stuck with them.People cannot imagine this because they cannot imagine the status quo changing to enable it. But for some reason, they can imagine a change to the status quo where Whites are either given a homeland in America via several states or where freedom of association is restored.  These changes are just as big and just as much a reversal as repatriation is.  Given the state of the US economy and what is likely to happen over the next 10 years, a huge chunk of them might just go back home of their own free will.  It’s better to be poor around your family than poor in a foreign country.

                AINO worships, absolutely worships the stupidest, most violent and dysfunctional people in its midst. And that worship is, for all intents and purposes, mandatory. It is not about to send any minority group packing.
OTOH, there are plenty of signs that AINO is slowly disintegrating, simultaneously with racial self-sorting. These two phenomena make the establishment of de facto, peripheral white states quite likely within 50 years.
In other words, those two outcomes, both of them positive, are not equally likely.

                    The fragmentation, self-sorting, and increasing dissolution are quite the white pills. In a way, the open border has worked to our benefit in that (a) it has accelerated the white exodus from Diversityville, and (b) the “migrants” in fact are migrating to the places with generous welfare benefits. The Regime would love to force the “migrants” to remain and live in the white places, but it is impossible. While they have been winning, it is sometimes to consider how idiotic our enemies are.

        “It would take longer than we have to take care of the problems.”–Z, paraphrased but accurately, I think.That truly is it. The generous estimate* is the United States has more than a decade** left in any cognizable form. It truly would take far more time to salvage the current system if that even is possible, which it isn’t. Politics no longer exists to effect anything, to the degree it ever did. The best advice is to sell your “vote” to the highest bidder at this point. Even that may not be available soon enough. The number of people who realize they exist in a totalitarian shithole only will grow.As for the short term, this likely is the last election in which the Republican Party even pretends to be competitive. I would argue that was 2020 but let’s fast forward to the present. People in dictatorships, even totalitarian ones like this abomination, are perfectly fine with it as long as bellies are full and houses are warm. All the grubby police state actions underway are to prepare for the day the food and power are hard to come by. People are OK with it for the time being.The only response now is to ride it out unless the Regime becomes arbitrarily violent toward you and your family, which it very well could happen. Unless that begins, become as self-sufficient as possible and as distant as possible from the unrest that is here and about to accelerate. I know that is roughly what Z said but it bears repeating.*Five years is more realistic now.**Barring a nuclear holocaust, which the lunatics in charge very well may bring.

            “The generous estimate* is the United States has more than a decade** left in any cognizable form”I was watching some videos this week about manufacturing.  One was from a metal stamping operation and one was making film.  Almost all of the highly skilled workers were boomers or Gen-X.  They featured 1 young guy learning to a machinist and he stated he had 3 years to go to become a journeyman (still years away from being a toolmaker).  In the olden days, a toolmaker had at least 20 years of machining experience and had to pass a lot of tests.  These guys get blueprints and have to design and then machine all the tooling.  In the 60s and 70s, America likely had close a million toolmakers and several million more of machinists who had yet to attain toolmaker certification.The dearth of talent is everywhere.  Being a toolmaker (I think this just makes a very good example) is not for the &lt;100IQ guy.  But it also doesn&#x27;t generally require a college education, yet still takes decades of training and experience.  For 4 decades we&#x27;ve been sending our brightest kids to school for computer programming or to be a lab-rat somewhere or some finance drone.  All of these kids getting a sociology degree or communications degrees who are working at Starbucks could have gone into the highly skilled trades. But they didn&#x27;t. Try telling these kids they need to go learn a skilled trade after wasting 4-6 years of their lives in college.  Now what little manufacturing we have left is 80 plus percent boomers fixing to retire in the next 10 years. We don&#x27;t have much time left.

                    Jack: Yup.  Even being my most charitable I find it difficult to understand how anyone, of any political affiliation, could look at population numbers and the means of electricity generation and remain sanguine about the next 5-10 years.  I don’t want to return to living in the 1800s, thank you very much.  I like indoor plumbing and air conditioning.  While I may not be able to replicate a full modern standard of living, with a bit of time and forethought and money one can ameliorate the worst effects of grid instability – at least for a few years.

                        Worse, they want to add the equivalent of 350 plus million gallons of gasoline demand a day to the grid. Even after adjusting to the relatively higher efficiency level of EVs, that’s still quite a bit of demand for the grid to absorb.  That’s just gasoline. They want to do the same with a large percentage of diesel.  They want to do it all with solar panels and windmills and all while the Boomers are retiring.
Fun times ahead.

                Saving American industry in any general way is now impossible for this reason. There are a few regions that avoided de-industrialization but most of the country abandoned making anything useful too long ago to bring any industry back. You would now need to just import everything and everyone who knew how to do anything from… I don’t know, alternate-universe-Germany-that-won-WWII. It would be almost like what American and European companies did in the 60s and 70s in Southeast Asia or Central America.This does suggest a possible course of action for an American Putin who wants to rebuild after we get done letting our Yeltsins drunkenly wreck everything. There should be some crash program to pull all the old boomer and Gen-X tradesmen out of retirement, and pay them a lot of money to run newly created Technical Academies to make sure those skills are preserved and eventually advanced. With the Wokesters gone, it should be trivial to make ads showing young White men throwing off their Starbucks uniforms and putting on welding helmets, steel toed boots, and grasping hammers and tongs. The whole thing could be done up in good Wagnerian style with a zero fucks given about how wammen and minorities view it.

        Agribusiness is a horrific knot to try to untangle. While family farmers are very much republican, the large agri-businesses are some of the worst perpetrators of stifling any attempt to control immigration. It becomes a double whammy too, as small farms are forced to also hire illegals to stay competitive.The only way to win is to pass laws essentially wiping out all the regulatory capture that allows big-agri to thrive and develop laws that give the advantage to small farmers. All of this will require a people with enough f-you money to ignore agri donations, and the willingness to accept higher food prices in the short term, or heavily subsidize farmers, which creates its own basket of problems.

        Sounds like Canada right now. Rent is unaffordable not just in the major cities but in every city and town. We have 1,000 Indian “students” lining up for 10 jobs at Walmart. Wages are too low, and even the rich/upper middle class is feeling the pain.Everybody knows that there is an immigration problem. Yet nobody can do anything about it. Some are worried about the “racist backlash” coming (is it?).  Others simply believe the lie that we “need” them for an aging population (how?). Others still are foreigners themselves who don’t want to close the border for obvious reasons. Others are greedy Liberal politicians who need more voters.So, nothing will happen until Canada becomes a 3rd world dump.I suspect that any unrest will be coming from various imported groups who want to kill each other. It’s also a mistake to assume that Filipinos and Indians will be happy working slave jobs at McDonald’s for Karens forever… Many still believe in the old dream of hard work at a shitty job turning into wealth and a home… For now.The difference with silly immigration policy is that there will be nothing to recover from when sanity is restored. France and Russia both went through periods of instability, but recovered because they were still French and Russian. How does Brazil Norte recover? Or India West? It doesn’t. In fact it’s already too late for the USA and France now, long term. Germany, UK, Canada, and AUS are one generation behind and closing in rapidly on the point of no return.

            One of the biggest eye-openers for me was when Canada was celebrating their 150th. My wife is Canadian, so we were watching the big events on TV. Every single place, from Yukon, NS, Alberta, etc had multiculturalism as the single most important part of the ceremonies. It was actually quite weird.
If we think the DIE stuff is a religion in the US, just look to Canada for how bad it can really get.

                Observations like yours are what cause me to see the media as the source of our subjugation.No people, not even compassionate whites who are curious about the world, would turn the dispossession of their people into a religion without constant brainwashing.This constant brainwashing clearly comes from the media and then flows into academia and business. What else could be the cause of what you report?Whatever hopes I had that people have the ability to think independently have been disproven.Until that source of brainwashing is dismantled our people will cheer on their rapidly oncoming demise with hearts full of proud virtue.Why the media has made the dispossession of whites its main goal is an exercise left to the reader, but the answer is not to maximize profits.

                    The media, to a woman, were trained to hate whites and love the Other by academia. They were then sent thither as change agents to dismantle the western world.
Academia is nowhere near as visible as the media, but it is the author of all our pain. When it all goes sideways, the professors (especially in the soc sci/humanities) and academic administrators should be the first to swing.

                        Likely, there is a single source behind both the media and academia.  But while I can imagine academia becoming less toxic without the media improving, I can’t imagine the reverse.
I’m not saying that you are blaming women for our situation, but blaming women ignores that they are conformist to whomever they perceive as the winners and can’t be the source.

                    Dr. William Pierce was once asked what his first priority would be if he somehow assumed total power. His answer was to immediately wrest control of the mainstream news and entertainment media from “You Know Who!”No matter where our struggle takes us and no matter who our future leaders are, William Pierce will have been proven right all along. In fact, I hope a mighty statue of him is someday erected in the spot from which MLK’s was removed.

            B125:  While many economic problems can be attributed to stupid policies, it seems to me they all trace back to population – i.e. too many (and too disparate) people ‘sharing’ a polity.  The population of the US and Canada (and England and Australia) continually increases by leaps and bounds . . . via immigration.  The birthrate of the heritage population is way below replacement.  And before some statistics guru ‘corrects’ me by noting dropping birthrates among non-White immigrants as well, that is irrelevant at present.  China and India and Africa have far more people than they can feed, educate, house, and employ NOW, regardless of whether these people average 2.3 children each in the future.They export these people and the misery they bring around the world.  We are to blame for the massive increase in food production and aid to the world’s excess.  We are also to blame for modern medicine and sanitation and their export.But it’s important to note that the American social workers among the White immigrants 1880-1920 noted their concern about the enormous number of children the Irish and Italian immigrants had, and the lack of sanitary habits.  So what changed?  Obviously the lack of a social safety net was one – most don’t realize just how many couldn’t hack it and returned home.  And obviously the wars killed off quite a few.But the basic, fundamental difference was/is genetic, and the culture that flows from biology.  These were White, European Christian people who possessed the genetic potential that was eventually realized via America’s (and Canada’s and Australia’s) space and opportunity and innovation.No, they weren’t all rocket scientists, and ‘assimilation’ has been half-assed in too many cases, but the genetic and cultural material enabled fusion of a sort.  Not so today.  Thousands of years of different genetics from countries and cultures that have never cared nor been able to provide for the mass of their people.  However many White/Han or subcon/White marriages people tout, these people’s success is dependent upon a functional educational system and society developed and maintained by Whites.And that is all going away.  It is decaying rapidly.  In many cases it’s already rotted and stinking.  And they cannot fix it – because they didn’t build it in the first place.  And all the academic and economic theories are just words and numbers – attempts to quantify what motivates men and enables them to build and thrive.  And what motivates people and what constitutes success is NOT the same all over –  spare me the pabulum about ‘we all want ‘x’ in life.tl;dr:  Different people are fundamentally different and so are their outcomes regardless of the inputs.  God scattered Babel and the Bible talks of disparate nations and peoples in heaven for a reason.  We separate or we all sink together.  And since we cannot influence what the WEF and Blackrock and their government minions do, we must separate ourselves and our families.  Those who don’t will go down with their magic papers and magic dirt and magic ‘brotherhood of man.’

                    I have watched them (SE Asians) take over socially, yes, the upper crust New England families I grew up with in the NE, by marrying into the 3rd-4th generations. The women are bright, often medical professionals with Ivy League degrees, who prey on the tennis-playing weak-unit children of the upper crust. Now there are grandchildren — who all look alike, right? Black hair and dark skin, no family resemblance to that Yankee stock that I can see. They are caste-ridden and we are too clueless to see what they are doing. Pushy in a way that the Chinese are not. Probably because their English language skills are superior. This also allows them to enter politics quickly. Can you say “Vivek Ramaswamy”? We had one a couple of years ago in TN who was running for US Senator. Pretended he was a man of the people. Turns out he attended a pricey local boarding school — not a public school in his “home town” — and then headed off to Brown. Fortunately a Trump-appointed ambassador/businessman won the primary. Haven’t heard from Dr. Manny Sethi since then.

        The reality is that for most of the country any immigration reform, even if it happened tomorrow,  would be much too late.   The damage has been done.

        Hmmmmmmm.Great show, Z, no bones about it.👍I don’t know how to take your assertion that “most people don’t want to change the system because they fear losing what little they have…”It bothers me. Look at the Greatest Generation – they went though the depression, and world war making huge and real personal sacrifices to safeguard their future and that of their kids. Then the boomers came of age and pissed all over that. My parents will happily see succeeding generations effed right over just as long as their place in the affluent white retirement community is restored. You certainly have them figured out.What I’m trying to say is that the Greatest Generation cared for their country and families…whereas we just don’t anymore. Hell’s bells…we are actually having “serious” debates with lunatics about whether we should castrate our sons and let pedophiles prey on them. Two generations ago, they would have been beaten into bloody green pulps or killed. Our grandparents similarly kept blacks on a very short leash, and watched the jews like hawks. Today they attack us with impunity. And we just sit back and yawn when our kids are killed and our women get raped.I’ve always maintained that any system you come up with is going to be useless if you don’t have the people to implement it and maintain it. You can’t reform immigration if you have blacks and minorities manning your borders. You can’t have a constitution or bill of rights if your judges and lawyers are jews.The wanks on Blab seem to have the right of it: we are all going to have to become better people. Not like our parents…but our grandparents. We will have to move and act on problems BEFORE they become problems. We are going to have to stop the lunatics that undermine our communities and families and take pride in doing so. We will need to save for the future, invest in our kids and their future…or we’ll be lost… and we have to do that while being square with God too. I dunno if that is even possible anymore.But…whadda I know? Have a great weekend Z – and the rest of you as well.

            I do not disagree. To be perfectly frank, the white population is going to get smaller before it gets better. A great culling is probably what lies ahead.

                    “Hell’s bells…we are actually having “serious” debates with lunatics about whether we should castrate our sons and let pedophiles prey on them.”The non-kinetic warfare that was waged on our people over decades (if not centuries) is something we need to develop immune systems to.   We are great at understanding we’re being destroyed when someone drops a bomb on us but terrible at recognizing when someone is destroying via both our vices and – ostensibly – our virtues.  One element that will have to be attended to is the cuckoo effect: the brainwashing of our females (and even our males to some extent) to care more for the progeny of other people than their own.  A people who can be convinced that their own existence – ‘whiteness’ – is a crime against humanity that needs to be destroyed is  a people without a healthy immune system.

                “104: Not their love of men but the impotence of their love of men keeps the Christians of today from— burning us.”From the footnotes, seems to be editor Kaufmann’s reading, or opinion: “If Christians were really passionately concerned for the salvation of their fellow men in the hereafter, they would still burn those whose heresies lead legions into eternal damnation.”To the question of what to do with those who resent mercy, add witch-burning to the list of solutions lol. So slavery, witch-burning— also expulsion. Peaceful separation, though admirable, clearly doesn’t work in practice and so doesn’t make the cut. One must assert oneself.Something LARPy about thinking this way, because, in the present day, such thinking still isn’t necessary. Also something dangerous— we can still afford the luxury of being timid.The Great Culling, which I agree probably will (and probably also must) happen, will be remembered as one aspect of a larger Great Hardening. We are no longer capable of defending ourselves, so things will have to continue to get worse before we’re capable of making them better again (assuming it’s not The End, which I don’t think it is). The beatings will continue until morale improves lol. Not being flippant, all you can do is laugh.I often wonder if feminism, multiculturalism, miscegenation, and the vaxx aren’t intentional for the purpose of this hardening, but I doubt the people in control still have the stones for it. EMJ quotes Hegel (iirc)— the ‘cunning of reason’. That’s probably it. Play God, get played by God.

            What I’m trying to say is that the Greatest Generation cared for their country and families—I tend to doubt any great inter-generational character differences.  Largely these are all the same people who would have made the same decisions given the information available to them at that time for that situation.  For as much as people piss on boomers (full disclosure: not a boomer) I see zero evidence that subsequent generations have acquired some great environmental-based insight (since it couldn’t be genetic) that would have prevented them from making the same decisions.

                About 70% of white men who served in WW2 were draftees. For blacks it was 90%. About 45% of young males wore the uniform and about a quarter of older males wore the uniform. Military age then was roughly 20-50. Of course, only about 15% of soldiers fired a weapon in combat and that includes sailors on ships well out of harm’s way.As for the depression, people buggered through the best they could. They did not revolt against the people who destroyed the economy or even seriously consider alternatives to the system. In fact, the emerging managerial class used the emergencies to seize power and solidify their hold on the political system. This became the springboard for the long march through the institutions.The lesson of the depression and the war is important. People will put up with a lot if they think what they have is worth defending or there is nothing better on offer. People only rise up when they feel they have nothing to lose and there is a vision of an alternative that is appealing.Right now, the suburban peasant likes his grill, his sports ball, his Bud Lite and his cubicle job enough to defend it against any radical change. He has something to lose. Further, no one is offering a vison of something better. Once those conditions change, and they will, then all hell breaks lose.

Indeed, the current Regime needs and wants the most acute crises they can possibly manufacture, because then they get to step in and offer the “solution” — which is ALWAYS more government power.
Not for nothing do the “climate” nutjobs use the phrase “Green NEW DEAL” when they demand a complete reorganization of society and totalitarian control of every aspect of life.  FDR wrote the playbook — first economic crisis, then war, and you have the entire population eating from the hand of the government.

                    There is truth to this. There is another side though. Most Americans at that time were rural and small town. They were the descendants of pioneers who had the balls to come to a frontier and make it or break it with no recourse. They were tough and that mentality was still strong.Americans outside the big cities just did not conceive of moaning to government. They hunkered down in their communities and made it work for themselves.They were also politically extremely naive. The frontiersman mentality that built this nation may have had the seeds of its undoing. Look at today. Blacks are in the catbird’s seat and about to sieze control of the military because of placing the highest priority on political action.At this point the self-reliant’s grand children look like cannon fodder for what may happen next. To think all of that sacrifice, grit and determination to make it through TGD on their own accord has come to this.

Bullshit. The farmers were the first people to suck on the New Deal teat. Ever hear of the Agricultural Adjustment Act? It was a continuation of decades of Democrat farmers demanding government favoritism that started in the 1890s with Bryan.
Now let’s talk about the TVA and the REA…

                Granted, the bright-line distinctions we throw up between generations are probably overstated, but there can be no denying that the white men who were adults in 1923 were made of far finer and sterner stuff than the white “men” who now exist. And I seriously doubt white men in 1923, given current data, would have support tranny admirals, pedophiles in the schools, a fag in the cabinet breastfeeding his poor adopted child, and negro miscegenation. In the intervening decades, there have been socioeconomic and intellectual factors that have catastrophically weakened the constitution of the white man.We are not now that strength which in old days/Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are.

                    The image that sticks with me is Ike bringing the soldiers out to force integration.  The fathers of these kids served in an actual war actually killing people, and yet, nothing.  I’d imagine the reaction would have been the same if they were frog-marching the kids off to the tranny hospital.  The only difference between then and now is that the “now” is so bad that we can’t fool ourselves like our ancestors.

                        As a preface, propaganda has become more ham-handed of late, I think, because the population has gotten dumber. Also, the Regime has decided it is safe to go to places it previously would not. Which explains:Recently newspaper photographs of the fierce white Southern resistance to integration have started to surface again after almost sixty or more years later. It is striking how vicious the National Guardsmen were, plainly ready to smash rifle butts into the skulls of protestors. These men, almost white to a person, acted like the PLA supposedly did in response to Tiannemen Square. I think, to add to my preface, these are a warning to people who might resist the police state, too. These pictures were considered too inflammatory to reproduce only a few years ago. I suspect it is wishful thinking on the part of the Regime that any meaningful resistance might emerge will be as benign as the admittedly strong protests captured in the photographs.

                        You’re speaking of the so-called “Greatest Generation,” which I will not defend. But the generation before it–whatever it’s called–wouldn’t have put up with any of that crap for a minute. It seems WWII was some sort of catalyst. Perhaps it was so horrific an experience that it simply knocked the guts and balls out of white men. They left them in the fields of France and the islands of the Pacific. After WWII, white men were more like beaten dogs than real men. And I’m afraid we still are…

                        @Ostei:
It has been postulated that World War I castrated the French and World War II did the same to the Brits. The latter may have extended to Americans. I know for damned sure the Cold War did.
A white pill, of sorts: the French in fact still have balls when it comes to colonialism, which they never actually abandoned. They are demographically set to be toast like America, but maybe not. Can Anglos emulate the Gauls?

            My take is the so called Greatest Generation was really the greatest at only one thing: following orders. Re: WW2, like most soldiers in most wars, they had no idea what they were really fighting for or why.They gave us the Civil Rights Act, integration, Hart Celler, Vietnam, fast food, financialization of the economy, outsourcing, and were the primary drivers of globalization/NAFTA.What really made them look great was that they came of age in a white society that was advancing technologically. How could such a society not look great? Yet they were the prime movers in seeing to it that the society would no longer be white.

                    I was born just before the Boomer era, which officially kicked off in 1946. My parents were OLD! I had a brother born in the mid-1920s;-) What I remember about my friends’ parents — elites who mostly lived through the Depression and WWII — was how determined they were that their precious darlings coming along post-WWII should not have any troubles or roadblocks to their sweet lives, as best it could be prevented. These parents were the ones who encouraged their kids to flee from the draft to Canada or to spend years in graduate school to avoid the same. These parents were all about patriotism, and served their country nobly in many cases, but couldn’t bear to see Junior delayed in getting a Yale law degree in 1970.

                That would be the Lost Generation, not the Greatest. They were young men during the Great War, and leaders by the time of World War II. Post-war, men like Eisenhower, fresh from starving German POWs to death, sent troops with bayonets to learn those ignorant Southerners. The generation in charge during the 1920s was perhaps the last to have any real grasp of immigration or race relations.

            The greatest generation is more properly known as the greatest destructive generation.  That generation in large measure landed us where we are today.  They elected FDR four times and kept the house and senate in democrat hands for years.The greatest stood back and did nothing when FDR took the US off the gold standard and, in effect, stole citizen gold dollars and gold holdings.  Reagan reversed this policy in the 1980s, in part. Thanks to Nixon’s closing the foreign dollar exchange for gold, the US now has some 9000 tons of the stuff and far more than any other country.The greatest allowed FDR to institute economic policies from Stalin’s playbook that made the depression worse.  Most destructive was farm policy which gave us generation after generation of welfare subsidy farmers we a yet stuck with today.  A serious consequence, among many others, is the almost complete destruction of the Ogallala aquifer.The so called greatest allowed FDR to maneuver them into a world war to save Stalin, or uncle Joe as he was called in the White House at the time.  As a result, US ended up losing WWII as we can see now.  But it was a war too far for US concern.  True Hitler declared war on the US but he was merely acknowledging an existing fact.The greatest gave us Truman who proceeded with the Korean dust-up, which war criminal Ike was able to stop, sort of.The not so greatest gave us the combo of sick man JFK and psychopath LBJ, who together gave us the Vietnam war.  It was Boomers who bore the brunt of that war and who at that time were too young to vote, but not too young to be drafted.The greatest gave us politicos who pass destructive Civil Wrongs laws which destroyed white communities and schools and flooded our great cities with the black plague.The greatest elected war criminal Ike two times who saw fit to invade the South again.Only after some of the greatest died off and Boomers began to vote, did the country drift somewhat to the right.The greatest generation is most destructive era second only to the Lincoln  Yankee fanatics and their mercenary hordes.

        Great show Z man. That pesky problem of human nature… it is a challenging one.Trapping raccons was done in the past by making an opening large enough for them to get their open paw in but too small to get their closed paw out and putting a shinny bit of foil in there. The curious coon would reach in and grab the foil and be unable to remove his paw and was trapped. He was unable to let go of the foil to escape. It was his now. He lost his freedom over a small and ultimately useless piece of foil.That is us. The suburban peasant. We can not lose what we have even though in the event of forseable future outcomes it will become a liability and become an unbearable cost.

            Vxxc: “they’re looking for EXIT, and the post USA gig…”I’d like to say that the power doesn’t emanate from Washington anymoar; that instead the power ackshually resides in controlling the fiat shekels which emanate from the NY Federal Reserve.But here’s muh problem: Somewhere there’s a great big Granddaddy mainframe computer which is responsible for sending voltage signals down the ethernet and through the cloud, to alert the various subservient computers that those computers’ owners now have moar fiat shekels to spend.So here’s muh question: Where precisely is that one great big Granddaddy mainframe computer?What’s the hardware?What’s the software?What’s the programming language? [FORTRAN? LISP? COBOL?]Who programs it?Who sits at the terminal and types in Base 2 numbers such as “1024 × 1024 × 1024 × 1024” [= 1.099511628×10¹²], hits the “return” key, and thereby pushes those particular voltage pulses down the ethernet and across the cloud to e.g. Goldman Sachs or Blackrock or FTX?And how do they [whoever they are] know that the downstream computers are not surreptitiously creating their own fake voltage pulses to masquerade as real voltage pulses?PS: How many rational solutions are there to Y² = x³+7 ?Thanks in advance!!!

        Bingo! Z-Man Hit it on the head when he suggested sanctioning Mexico. I’ve been thinking that for years! We actually went to war with Mexico back in 1846, we got what we wanted, and life went on. Friends again!We need to go to war with them again because if you think it over, which country actually causes us ongoing trouble year in and year out? Iran? North Korea? Nope! The very least the Mexican Government can do is stop migrants from all over the third world from crossing their territory to get here.

I’ve been thinking that for years!”For the last few years, I have been thinking strongly about simply nuking moast of Mexico [with a strong emphasis on deploying fusion bombs to incinerate anyone and everyone who is less than about 256 degrees of Kevin Bacon separated from the Cartels].I also can’t shake the suspicion that the catholic church is using illegal immigration in an attempt to destroy Protestant Christianity in the USA.I’m entirely certain that the partisan Potato Kneegrows such as Joe Biden get literal wood every time a catholic illegal alien murders a White Christian boy or girl.He11, I wouldn’t be surprised if many of the partisan Potato Kneegrows were actively rooting for Santa Muerte Herself.

                    To be fair, the Catholic Church also helped build your civilization.
Granted, the ones currently running it (from ca. 1950s onwards) aren’t worth a warm bucket of spit.  But in destroying Western Civ they have also destroyed the Church.  By the way, a large portion of the border jumpers also jump ship to Protty churches.  And the Lutherans and Presbys are in on the immigration grift as well.

                “I also can’t shake the suspicion that the catholic church is using illegal immigration in an attempt to destroy Protestant Christianity in the USA.”It’s true and I’ve even (over-)heard it directly from Catholics. We need our own societies because our ways are incompatible, but meanwhile, the existence of Protestantism will forever be a permanent threat to the Vatican bureaucracy’s legitimacy. I wish the rank-and-file Catholics would discern what their clergy’s real problem with Marty Luther is. Maybe if we put a Trump wig on his picture?At this point, it’s kind of funny. Catholics still disrespect Protestants while they… ah, Protest… against the obvious illegitimacy of Pope Frankie. They don’t understand us enough to recognize that they’ve become one of us.

Few things are more predictable or funny (albeit sad) than the the proudly determined historical ignorance of American Protestants.

                        Apparently Rome butchered so many Cathars that we don’t have a strong paper trail as to precisely what it was that constituted Catharism.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CatharismOTOH, a century or two after the Cathars, the Lollards made dadgum certain to immortalize their complaints:The Twelve Conclusions of the Lollardshttps://chaucer.fas.harvard.edu/pages/twelve-conclusions-lollardsOn a grotesquely vulgar, visceral &amp; corporeal level, what’s fascinating about the Conclusions of Lollardy  is that more than six hundred years ago, Rome was already host to precisely the same corporeal sins that we see today in Klownworld: Nuns murdering their unborn children &amp; Priests sodomizing the altar boys.[Plus ca change, plus c’est la meme chose…]But for folks who are also interested in moar abstract &amp; theoretical subject matter, the Conclusions are remarkably well-argued, and constitute an excellent read for a lazy Sunday afternoon.

            The problem I see with that is that roughly a third of Mexicans live and work in the US (based on the stats that came out when Biden met with Obrador last year.) That’s 40 million people. Most of whom are totally on board with “reconquista.”  All the cartels would have to do is arm them.  You’ve seen the border jumpers: overwhelmingly unskilled, military-age men. We’d have to invade them, but they already have an army here.

                RoBG:  And every half and quarter Mexican here plays up his non-White ‘heritage’ and all the gibs he gets in return.  For those who think they have half Mexican ‘friends’ (from the military or college) – wise up.

            “The very least the Mexican Government can do is stop migrants from all over the third world from crossing their territory to get here.”
In this regard, the Mexican government is doing exactly what the US government wants it to do.

        We’ll see what the turnout is next year. My faith in the future will depend a lot on how many people show up at the polls.I hope that the only people really invested, anymore, in elections are the cloud people, a smattering of activists, and maybe Boomers. So we’re talking the 1%, the idiots, and the guys with War Vet hats driving around in gold carts. Not a whole lot of people.Remember when media types would decry the fact that only about half the population voted? “If you don’t vote, you can’t complain”? I wonder if that same messaging is going out now. Twenty years ago the cloud people encouraged the public to get involved in the democratic process, “no matter who you vote for”, because America. I remember when candidates would publicly urge people to just vote, even if it’s for the other guy. I doubt that Gavin Newsom or any Democrat is going to say that. (Republicans might, but they’re hopelessly out of touch as we all know.)It’ll be fun seeing people start to realize our country is becoming Venezuela.

            Regardless of how many people actually vote, the reported numbers will indicate a record-setting turnout, for the Dems of course. How else will they be able to go on and on about their powerful, paradigm-changing mandate?
Pretty sure we’ve seen this playbook before. The cycle after that, expect to see mandatory voting.

            “I hope that the only people really invested, anymore, in elections are the cloud people, a smattering of activists, and maybe Boomers.”Lots of Red State people still think voting harder is the way to hold the line. Democracy can work if we never vote them in the first time!Although I suspect they don’t really care about politics at all, and just want the system to both operate itself and occasionally ask for their opinions. Which is fine to an extent. Healthy people don’t get excited at the prospect of micromanaging their neighbors.By contrast, Marxists make the government their God then dedicate their lives to usurping God. “Make the personal the political” isn’t just their strategy, it’s the air they breathe.Thus, the ideal political system forces the “leave me alone” men to rule while oppressing the “it’s my turn” men. A contradiction that humanity has yet to resolve, beyond “no women”.

            “If you don’t vote, you can’t complain”?
I’m sure I’ve read it here, but the rational response is that if you vote, you can’t complain.  If you go to Vegas knowing the odds are stacked against you, and you put your money down, what right do you have to complain the odds are stacked against you?
