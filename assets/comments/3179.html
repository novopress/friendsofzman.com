        I personally think that this impulse to seemingly follow the PC impulse on the starboard side of the political spectrum is driven by several factors.1) There’s what appears to be a disturbing buy-in on the part of some righties to the notion that you write about in this essay; that by pulling the lever for an official member of the former-victim-of-the-white-patriarchy group will serve to socially expiate the original sin of the white maleness. Either by demonstrative, zealous, support during the election itself or publicly preening about one’s vote after the fact.2) The conservatives are surrendering to the notion that the divisive PC/multi-culti/tribalist mindset has been successfully inculcated into a majority the US population. So, as such, in order to achieve electoral success they’re going to “fight fire, with fire” so to speak, either unaware of, or unwilling to admit to, the long term conseqences of such a gambit3) They’ve decided to sign on with the populist wave in whatever form they need to in order to enjoy victory at the polling place.For what it’s worth, in my own humble opinion, I think Murray mistaken. The left is already practicing a divide-and-conquer for of tribalistic ethnic fetishism for years…
