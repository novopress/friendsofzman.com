        I think you may be misinterpreting the phenomenon we are seeing at the NRO Mr. Z. It‚Äôs the same thing going on at all the mainstream media outlets. In order to boost diving readership and ratings, ALL the mass media platforms, left and right ‚Äì have been reduced to trolling their own readership to manufacture controversy. It works too: You read some inflammatory idiocy on the NRO, post a link on one of the most popular blog sites on the net, and all your loyal fans (including Yours Truly) ‚Äì dutifully hie thee hence over to the NRO to see what all the stupidity is about.  That is why Goldberg, Sloppy and Fwench are running the show. You were never trolling them, Z‚Ä¶ the were trolling you. Your sin was only that you were better at it than they were. üôÇThe liberal ragsheets do it too. There true-pink degenerate editors will deliberately post material or run a token conservative that will incense Lefty sensibilities ‚Äì and every homosexual, feminist, atheist, Marxist and loon will show up for the food fight. Instant ratings, click counts, and gratified advertisers.I think that we are not losing to Lefty because they are smarter, faster and meaner than we are. I think we‚Äôre losing because of our inner cucks and white knights. We don‚Äôt want to take the gloves off, we don‚Äôt want to throw that punch, or fire that shot or end that relationship‚Ä¶ and now we find ourselves in a corner with dwindling options.Conservatism to me is nothing more than common sense. I have no problem with what queers do in their bedrooms. I have a huge problem with what they are doing in the classroom, the washroom, and the boardroom. I have no problem with competent intelligent women in the workplace; I have huge problems with the affirmative action phonies and poseurs. Ditto for blacks and minoritiies.I can get along with libertarians and even liberals. I will even respect them if they reciprocate. But of course, that isn‚Äôt happening; they insist on seeing me as a threat and are psyching themselves up for a war. The sooner we see that and deal with it the better off we‚Äôll all be.

            At it‚Äôs root, ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù is really just ancient wisdom that is passed from generation to generation. That tradition added to the robustness of the species and therefore was a net benefit to all. But now, our macro social forces are proactively killing off common sense as if it was a disease, and we are all worse off because of it.

            Agreed on the whole clickbait thing. Sometimes I have to step back and remind myself of this, as it is easy to get caught up in the adrenaline rush of the daily doses of outrage.  This takedown of Rod Dreher comes to mind.https://www.takimag.com/article/the_roof_korean_option_a_response_to_rod_dreher_jesse_russell/A choice quote from this:‚ÄúDreher spends his columns (often filled with more copy-and-pasted writings of other people than his own thoughts) taking his readers on an interminable emotional roller coaster back and forth between white guilt and pride in ‚Äúthe Western tradition‚Äù (depending on the week). Like a therapist who profits from his patients never getting better, Dreher has no real solution to any of the critiques he presents, because if he did, the drama would be over and millennial crunchy cons would not be able to share a cry with Rod over coffee and Ativan in the morning. ‚ÄùReading this, I realized that Dreher (as the main draw at TAC) must feel an obligation to keep the eyeballs coming back several times per day, so indeed he must always stoke outrage, much like a right-wing talk radio host, but always put any resolution way out on the distant horizon.

            You decry what you call ‚Äúcucks‚Äù and then literally in the next sentence promote cuckservatism:‚ÄúI have no problem with what queers do in their bedrooms‚Äù (I‚Äôm OK with degeneracy and moral relativism).‚ÄúI have no problem with competent intelligent women in the workplace‚Äù (I‚Äôm OK with feminism, just don‚Äôt let it go too far.)‚ÄúDitto for blacks and minoritiies.‚Äù (I‚Äôm OK with losing the country my ancestors fought for.)This is an excellent piece by Z because it makes clear that the new thing that is needed to replace conservatism must have at its core, an uncompromising stance towards moral absolutes. This is something that milquetoasts and losers cannot stand, an absolute line in the sand dictating what is Right and True and Good versus the forces of evil, subversion and degeneracy.

        My father loved Ayn Rand. I woke up one morning when I was 12 and Anthem was on my nightstand. Huge reader so I just picked it up and read it cover to cover. I read Atlas Shrugged 3 times by the time I was 20. But that still meant I had plenty of years to look into her and her ideology. It was completely removed from reality. She was a hero worshipper that applied her ideology to her personal life and just created Mayhem all around her.Life is messy and like many people I like order but it‚Äôs always going to fall apart eventually. There are many verses to the story of man but the chorus is always the same, slaughter, blood and cleansing fire

            You say ‚Äú[Rand] was completely removed from reality.‚Äù
I think she explained reality as well as anyone ever has.  She provided the tools for understanding how the world works, both politically and economically.

        So many people are black pilled these days but the greatest white pill is that this current tumult in America is the death rattle in the throat of conservatism. We have never been more ripe for revolution. The pieces on the board are perfect for a massive paradigm change and for a new order to take the reigns. All we need is some leadership. Any takers?

            So far it doesn‚Äôt look like it and the factionalization  even among the dissident right makes things harder.Finding that sweet spot, the compromise that works is THE challenge our Founding Fathers faced and the same one we faceThe ‚ÄúLeave me alone/Constituionalists‚Äù can‚Äôt lead  and millions of people myself included will not follow nor permit the Deus Volt crowd who are at least  willing to lead to turn the US into Iran with more Jesus.And note I know how much that sounds like what the Left says. The reason I think its true is if there is a revolution as vs. an election, all the gloves come off and once blood is spilled, no reason to stop until you have everythingThus my opinion unless handled with great care, its 30 years war 2.0That said I won‚Äôt step up to the bat not because I‚Äôm afraid of ruling but because I‚Äôm not fit. I‚Äôve the brains and though I may be wrong the knowledge I lack the Alpha traits required . No   one would follow me for a lot of reasons and while I get loyalty and honor, the ‚Äúworld‚Äù the Alphas live in and need to project is foreign to me and I don‚Äôt care about virtually anything they do.People like me aren‚Äôt fit for leadership anyway unless you want the Austrian or the like.

                factionalization even among the dissident right makes things harder.
To culturally appropriate Cathedral language, diversity is our strength. The more fractions we have, the more moles they need to whack. By not having leaders or ideologies, we give them no big targets. That‚Äôs what makes the Yellow Jackets so dangerous to the French government: there‚Äôs nobody to bribe, nobody to threaten or kill.

                    Fair point, The presence of police and security people who support the yellow jackets disallow the usual strategy of just shooting or imprisoning  enough people to force  complianceAlso generally the cathedral avoid the whip hand as it causes reprisals. What happened to Charlie Hebedo , who while satirical was an approved satire sent a strong message. You are vulnerableHowever let me ask, if there are hundreds of factions and they manage to take the Cathedral down nibbling it to death by the proverbial ducks how is anyone supposed to actually governDistributive 18th century systems won‚Äôt work in modernity

        I think the Alternative Right has a satisfactory intellectual foundation‚Äîmore satisfactory than any of the others that you mention‚ÄîMarxism, conservatism, libertarianism, this ism that ism, ism ism ip!  The foundation is simply that race is real and that the USA is a country founded by and for persons of white euaropean descent, and moreover that we are the only ones capable of sustaining and advancing western civilization.  What is the difference between alternative right and white nationalism, that is a good question for analysis, but I would say that alternative right is less extreme in that it allows for the presence of minority groups of nonwhites who are committed to the maintainance and upholding of white civilization, not its humiliation and marginalization.

            I mean, the foundations are simple, common sense, so they don‚Äôt require large volumes and arcane language to expound.  Political ideologies such as you discuss are complex smoke screens and misdirections, possible compromises of opportunity, which veil simple, primal interests.  For example, with neoconservatism:  if you agree to attack the Middle East, maintain virtual open borders, we will support your bid for low taxes on the wealthy, less affirmative action, and rhetoric against gay marriage and abortion.  This could be seen as a compromise of opportunity between the old Anglo elite, your bushes and Cheneys, with the new Jewish elite.  But take a hard look‚Äîthe gains of one group, based in race and land are real, while the other, based in theology and funny money that could be made into confetti overnight, are transitory.  Somebody got neoconed!

            The problem with the alt-right is it is not really a philosophy or even a coherent set of ideas. It‚Äôs mostly the personal brand of Richard Spencer. He‚Äôs out advocating for things like the universal basic income and a debt jubilee for millennials now. How you get that from his arguments for a supranational white ethnostate is unclear. It‚Äôs why they were so easily co-opted by the WN 1.0 guys. They had no natural defense, because they had not worked out why they believe what they believe and the implications of it.I‚Äôm not trashing Spencer or the alt-right. I just think it ran its course. There‚Äôs a lessons to be plucked from that failed experiment.

                The alt-right was the movement it needed to be, when it needed to be it. It may have been clumsy and excessive, but it finally put white identity politics in the Overton window and on the map.While the alt-right as a movement appears moribund, the zeitgeist that spawned it seems to be growing in leaps and bounds. I hear things spoken routinely that no one would have had the balls to say five years ago, including from the President of the United States himself.The alt-right may be over, but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd call it a failure. It at least got the ball out on the field. Successor movements will have to get it to the goal post. The alt-right didn‚Äôt need to become an institution, it just needed to go bang once and get plenty of attention. While it may have ended less elegantly than it should have, it accomplished what it needed to.

                    The alt-right as an internet phenomenon was quite effective at reinvigorating race realism. It‚Äôs a good lesson that even the most bitter pills can go down with a little honey. All those funny guys making racist and irreverent jokes did more good than a library of books from the paleocons and paleo-libertarians. They still exist, but mostly confined to Gab now, as the social media platforms have purged anyone with a sense of humor.I think the alt-right as a legitimate political force was a bust. Some of it was bad choices. Some of it bad people, of course. A lot of the criticism of Spencer is unfair, but he did step on his dick a lot. The term alt-right has become entwined with his personal brand and who knows where that is going now. He seems to think he can become a WASP Bernie Bro. Maybe. I‚Äôm skeptical though.

                        I‚Äôm not so sure the term ‚Äòalt right‚Äô is totally entwined with Spencer, at least from where I stand.When I explain the concept of alt / dissident right to friends overseas or other non-red-pilled who are willing to shut up long enough to listen, I refer to myself alternately as either alt or dissident right (depending on how I am feeling that day).For me, it‚Äôs a definition that refers to ‚ÄúRight‚Äù but outside of the mainstream box of the  R ‚Äì D framework.Maybe I‚Äôm using it ‚Äúwrong,‚Äù but it seems the best definition still, today, for what we all seem to be adhering to, in varying degrees and flavors.

                I recently heard Richard Spencer supporting a universal basic income on JF Gariepy‚Äôs ‚Äúthe Public Space‚Äù show.  He also regularly brings up the economic issues that Ocasio-Cortez talks about, thinking that the ‚Äúalt-right‚Äù needs to make these issues part of the platform in order to appeal to young people. These are interesting topics to debate, but I‚Äôm at the point where I don‚Äôt know if Spencer is serious or if he‚Äôs just being provocative.

                    A stated goal to appeal to the youth in a democratic system is one of the surest signs of a political amateur. It‚Äôs all the proof we need that Spencer isn‚Äôt serious. He might believe that he‚Äôs serious, but he‚Äôs just putting a racial spin on Conservatism Inc.‚Äôs failed strategy of appeasement.

                Might the lesson simply be that Spencer is a bad politician?  Coherent sets of ideas are the first to go when politicians have their first taste of success.  Lenin and Mao got movements named after them, but for all the formidable technobabble they both boil down to ‚Äúdo what you have to to sell your movement to the rubes; retcon it with The Scriptures afterwards.‚Äù  This is why I think Trump is doomed to fail ‚Äî there‚Äôs Trump, but there‚Äôs no ‚ÄúTrumpism.‚Äù  He doesn‚Äôt need to go write a manifesto (though it couldn‚Äôt hurt), but he absolutely has to get himself a movement, with symbols, chants, dress code, the works.  (The Left has all this in spades; getting people not to notice the utter uniformity ‚Äî i.e. actual uniforms ‚Äî of the herd of independent minds is one of their greatest triumphs)

                    A few years ago I was in a room with a lot of alt-right people. Spencer was there. The thing that struck me was how everyone talked about their social media strategy and media strategy. The alt-right was an effective social media movement because ultimately, it was about getting attention on social media. I think that was the undoing of the alt-right. Think about the social media personalities that have come and gone over the last few years. It became a bug light for attention whores like Milo, McInnes, Cernovich, et al.That said, you‚Äôre right about Trump. There‚Äôs no organized movement underneath him.

                        To me, that‚Äôs the crux. There‚Äôs no home base for Whites who wish to stand up for their people, even if that simply means demanding that Whites not be persecuted.If you speak out, you can lose your job, career, friends and, possibly, family. What Whites need is a network of other Whites to back you up if you get fired for opposing immigration or supporting freedom of association.We need businessmen who will hire the fired executive. We need think tanks that will hire academics banished from universities for speaking the truth. We need media outlets to hire writers. We needed legal defense funds to sue anyone and anything that goes after Whites. We need political organizations to push our cause and to provide money to candidates.We need an alternative infrastructure.That won‚Äôt happen chatting about things on the Web. That can only happen by people meeting in person and trusting that they can rely on each other.The dissident right need to move from the Internet to the real world.

Yes. We need to be talking up andperformingthe kinds of specific, practical actions that you describe. Never mind the sterile ideological manifestos and theorizing.
If the dissident right can ‚Äúmove from the Internet to the real world‚Äù it won‚Äôt matter what the movement is called and the quest for genuine leaders (as opposed to media ‚Äúpersonalities‚Äù) will get a jolt of energy.

                                Whites continue to believe that the overall society is ‚Äútheir‚Äù society. We‚Äôre all Americans, right?Wrong.We are now just one group among many. We need to create a White community within the larger society. No need to wait for a revolution or financial collapse. This is something that we can do now.(Btw, if civil unrest or a financial collapse ever happened, having an already formed White community would be hugely helpful. If they don‚Äôt happen, we‚Äôd still be on our way to carving out our own spot in whatever the United States is heading toward.)But it‚Äôs going to be incredibly difficult. This is what Spencer should have doing these past couple of years. Quietly working to help form White or European-American student groups, business associations, think tanks, community groups. (Instead, he pranced around looking for attention.)These organizations should bend over backward to not appear White nationalist. Never use that rhetoric. They should have the exact same rationale and purpose of any Asian American, Jewish, Black or Hispanic group. Use the left‚Äôs words against them.When they call the group racist, demand that they disband every ethnic/religious organization.It‚Äôll be hard at first, but once you get just a few of these groups with just a few members, the stigma will start to dissipate and the groups will grow, which, of course, makes them stronger and thus more difficult to attack.The vast majority of Whites will stick their nose up at these groups. Fuck em. We only 5% or 10% of Whites to join in to make this work. After the ball starts rolling, other Whites will join. I‚Äôd suspect that ~5% to 10% of Whites really hate what‚Äôs going on. Another 30% to 50% would love to join in after it‚Äôs safe.The rest can ‚Äì and will ‚Äì go to hell.

Whites aren‚Äôt unified. A solid 45% of white people and more than half of single white women reliably vote for the left.

                                I agree with what you say. Indeed, ‚ÄúWhites‚Äù may be too broad a category. But you have to start somewhere. Start pushing for groups that will look out for Whites and see where that leads.Regardless, if Whites somehow survive that period of history, the herd will have been severely culled. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if half of Whites disappear through not having kids or breeding with other groups.Fine.As HBD Chick points out, odds are pretty good that NW Europeans had a lot of their clannishness bred out of them. That worked for a while, but it‚Äôs a huge negative now. That needs to be reversed. It won‚Äôt be easy or pretty.That‚Äôs why I said it would start slowly and painfully (and it might not work at all), but there are Whites out there who want to be with their own.Maybe the way groups form isn‚Äôt some general ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù label. Maybe Southern Whites coalesce as a group. Maybe Christian Whites cometogether. Whatever. Who cares.Let‚Äôs just get the ball rolling.I simply believe that we need to move past a Web movement or relying on people like Spencer. We can do something now instead of waiting around for some Red Dawn scenario.

                                    Neither ‚Äúwhites‚Äù nor hyphenated-whites is a useful foundation on which to build a movement or nation. Most of the people who advocate for this do so knowing full well that they aren‚Äôt part of the posterity that the early English and Dutch settlers were talking about. They want to invent a tribe that still includes them but not the coloreds and Jews they hate. That‚Äôs why white nationalism can‚Äôt succeed; it‚Äôs not identitarian, merely exclusionary. It defines itself not by what it is, but by what it isn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the same reason Progressivism is fracturing. An identity based *only* on exclusion will always purity-spiral and then break down.WNs are binary thinkers, just like SJWs. They see ‚Äú60% of white men‚Äù and think ‚Äúall white men‚Äù. They see ‚Äú85% of black men‚Äù or ‚Äú70% of mestizos‚Äù and think ‚Äúall blacks and browns‚Äù. It‚Äôs a horrendous way to build a coalition. Try flipping the numbers around and you‚Äôll realize that 15% of black men and 30% of hispanics support you ‚Äì that‚Äôs literally tens of millions ‚Äì while 40% of whites will fight you to the death ‚Äì that‚Äôs about 120 million. ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù anything means that in America, you lose by numbers and by attrition, especially if you can‚Äôt manage your optics and 80-90% of your white target audience won‚Äôt back you anyway.That‚Äôs not an argument for civic nationalism, by the way ‚Äì just understanding the difference between implicitly vs. exclusively white, and the difference between explicitly racial identity vs. class identity that uses race as a wedge.

                                        Your observations are spot on.  Nevertheless, I am a white nationalist and here‚Äôs why:
First, a racial identity can be imposed by an enemy.  For example, blacks in the USA, no matter which parts of Africa they descended from or how mixed they are, identify as a group because of slavery.  Similarly, the disparate white groups will be forged into a group by the accusation of ‚Äúwhite privilege.‚Äù
Second, a white ethnostate is not bound to accept the whites who reject white identity.

                        If Trump had a party of Trumpism with loyalists in the military then a coup could be feasible. His Levers of Power speech on the campaign run in Palm Beach, Florida nearly made me a true believer myself. It really seemed like he knew that he was a strong man prepared to take down the corrupt powers that be. If he would have pivoted from those anti-globalist speeches and had a party to take power I‚Äôd be the first one to run for my rifle and drive to DC to hang traitors. I‚Äôd even have a few extra rifles for you, my friends.

                    Trumpism is the traditional Republican platform, but with border enforcement and fighting back hard against the media.  Trump has moved the Overton window by showing Republicans they don‚Äôt have to fear a brown backlash or the NY Times.  If Romney had used this approach, and meant it, he probably would have won.  My depression is that the Republican party will not learn this lesson, and will revert to the same open borders, chamber of commerce, fear of the media pussies they have been since Reagan.  Thinking back to the history of Bush, Dole, Bush 2.0, McCain, Romney and imagining more of the same, makes me want to just move to Mexico now and get it over with.

                Anybody who advocates for universal basic income is #1) a moron,  and #2) a leftist.I haven‚Äôt really followed Richard Spencer much ‚Äì but if he is for UBI,  that tells me all I need to know about him.As far as I am concerned the Western world got where it is (was?) ‚Äì because people WORKED.  All those fancy buildings, cathedrals, infrastructure ‚Äì etc ‚Äì didn‚Äôt build itself.  And despite the blatherings of BLM and it‚Äôs ilk ‚Äì it wasn‚Äôt built by slaves either.  It was built by white MEN , who worked their asses off.  So much so that many white men will just work themselves into the ground even though the evidence piles up all around them that their work is enabling their enemies.That‚Äôs why I am FIRMLY of the opinion that : you simply cannot have socialism of ANY form combined with diversity and working white men.  It‚Äôs simply a formula for failure.   Many white men (Japanese men are known to be like this as well) ‚Äì will work themselves to death.  This is something Jordan Peterson has pointed out.  You start adding diversity to that ‚Äì and the natural sluggish behavior of much of the diversity now becomes subsidized.It‚Äôs a perfect recipe for failure.It‚Äôs why I trace much of the demise of the West to the notion that you can get something for nothing (socialism).Work or die keeps people honest.

                I thought Spencer was fairly easy to read. He is promoting fabianism which is fashionably white elite politics of fifty years ago. His problem is that he is promoting it to the lower classes and he is grossly over-estimating the power of white elites to buck the diaspora status quo.With respect to the alt right, or dissident right even, more generally: idealism is what victors write about to justify their conquest and holdings. If the right in general is still poweless, which they are, it would behoove them not to have a positon on UBI or anything else until and unless they have decided for certain that it is or is not good for the whites and whether or not it or the promise thereof can be used to out flank enemies on the left.

        It needs repeating that The Enlightenment was an Eighteenth Century phenomenon, and that it was replaced, especially on the Continent, by the Romantic Movement of the Nineteenth Century. The Romantic Movement explicitly rejected the Enlightenment ideals of individualism, reason and science and embraced feeling, intuition and oceanic submergence in a greater whole.All leftist movements are Romantic, and the prevailing political ideology of the West is today Romantic. Realization of that fact, and of the fact that the Enlightenment is a dead letter, is necessary to effectively oppose the leftist horror that is coming.The Antifas thugs in Portland and Seattle are openly threatening to kill their opponent, and the police and political establishment support them.

            Bob S;I‚Äôd say Romanticism hooked up with the Enlightenment at a wine bar in Germany and spawned Marxism.  Don‚Äôt forget that Marx was the proud producer of *Scientific Socialism* as a corrective for earlier failed (because unscientific) experiments in Communism aka communal living by various sects.  Or so he thought.
Also, it‚Äôs not hard to make the case that Rousseau, who considered himself part of the enlightenment, is one of the fathers of both Romanticism and Marxism.
Point being, *both* should be rejected for their respective roles in leading to the current lunacy.

                Indeed, Rousseau, considered himself part of the Enlightenment, but Allan Bloom (in his famous book ‚ÄúThe Closing‚Ä¶.‚Äù) stressed that Rousseau was a *‚Äùheretic‚Äù* (from the Enlightenment), and was thus a decisive mover in the West‚Äôs history, largely for his spurring of Marxism etc.
Insofar as the Enlightenment birthed *capitalism*, the act of also pinning the birth of (its mega-foe) Marxism on it is, to me, rather unfair.

                    Yes.  Rousseau was a transitional figure  from the Enlightenment to Romanticism.  But his heresies did intrigue the French Enlightenment figures (Voltaire, Diderot) and some few  British (as I recall, Hume) and of course reached full flower in Germany.  Luckily the US founders stuck mostly with Locke, Montesquieu, Smith etc.  The tug of Rousseau‚Äôs heresies was felt mostly by Jefferson who was thank goodness mostly ignored when it came time to design the post revolution government.  Thus the US didn‚Äôt go Full Continental until He Who Must Not Be Named drove the most energetic of the 20th Century post Enlightenment thinkers to our shores, where, lacking native predators, they have flourished, replacing our Enlightenment liberalism with the Managerial State.Or something like that.

                ‚ÄúI‚Äôd say Romanticism hooked up with the Enlightenment at a wine bar in Germany‚ÄùPretty close. Lenin hung out in Zurich near the first Dada venue called Cabaret Voltaire.Were dadaists socialists? Lenin, who hung out at a place next to Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich, never gave them any commissions after the revolution. I get the feeling he didn‚Äôt like Naum Gabo very much.Certain German expressionists such as Emil Nolde were originally accepted by Goebbels and Alois Schardt, director of the Nationalgalerie in Berlin. But¬†Hitler, in 1934, made it clear that ‚Äúmedievalist expressionism‚Äù was out. This, even after Nolde, Mies Van der Rohe, Erich Heckel, Ernst Balach and others signed a call for loyalty to the Fuhrer earlier that year.

                ‚ÄúAlso, it‚Äôs not hard to make the case that Rousseau, who considered himself part of the enlightenment, is one of the fathers of both Romanticism and Marxism.‚Äù
Expressionism is considered to be a reaction to Dada, and therefore Romantic, i.e., both individualist and anti-tradition but one super intellectual snob and the other angst-ridden and prole.

            bob, a really good start!When you say that ‚Äúthe Enlightenment is a dead letter‚Äù, do you mean this in a philosophical sense, or only in a Realpolitik sense?I‚Äôd consider a dropping of the philosophical achievements of the Enlightenment (of, say, Machiavelli, Newton, or Montesquieu) to be quite a mistake, until their insights can be incorporated into the utterly necessary challenge to Romanticism.

So are anti-romantic like Dada. Dadaism is basically emptiness and irony. It is the dominant modernist movement today with Marcel Duchamp as the patron saint.

        We‚Äôre living in a period of extreme crisis, where ideology is irrelevant, because the only important question is a biological one.  The White race is on the brink of extinction, at the point of being snuffed out and exterminated by the mudslide and its (((gleeful enablers))).  If this extinction is not prevented and reversed, nothing else matters. The only thing conservatives need to conserve, and I do mean the ONLY thing, is the White nations.  How this comes about doesn‚Äôt really matter, so long as the effort is successful.

        There is an enormous gulf between what my neighbors here in a deep, deep red corner of already deep red Indiana think conservatism is versus what our ‚Äúleaders‚Äù think conservatism is. If you ask them what it means to be conservative, you will get a long list of talking points (pro-life, traditional marriage, smaller government, etc.).How many of the pundits and politicians that we call ‚Äúconservative‚Äù hold any of the same positions that they do? For many years we assumed peopled like Bill Kristol, Glenn Beck and Jonah Goldberg were supposed to be on our side but in reality they are just in this to sell crappy books and support a lavish lifestyle without actually working. We haven‚Äôt had a recognizably conservative President since Reagan left office, and even that is debatable, and we have had 14 years of Republican Presidents since. Conservatism is just a racket these days for people like Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck to get retirees and truck drivers wound up while never, ever crossing the line. I used to get angry when people on this side said it but the first order of business really is going to be dismantling Conservatism, Inc. before anything else can get done.

        I read through the comments on the 2017 Pinochet post referenced at the end of yesterday‚Äôs thread.  I had such optimism!  The midterms solved that.  The Trump/Maga thing is not a sea change, for us it is the Tiananmen Square, stretched out.  Trump is going for some tariffs, tax cuts, and a border wall, all of which will be quickly reversed in a few years.  Net result, zero.  Vote harvesting will see to that.  Like Obama‚Äôs followers, who read much more into him than was actually there, some of us, including me, have done the same with Trump.  Mea culpa.  Like the students in China, we have outed ourselves and will have nothing to show for it.What we, and the Chinese students, do have, is an acute understanding of the opposition we face, and how we can only succeed over time by going underground, and letting things above ground take their course.  Because we are now a nation of dindus and gimmees, the time frame for failure is rather short.One other thing, the ‚Äúother side‚Äù is one charismatic leader short of reviving the German experience.  A heightened sense of ostracizing the designated ‚Äúother‚Äù (which is us) is in place, the disarming of the civilians will proceed, and broken windows, burning books, and bashing over the head are now sanctioned, as long as the right people are doing it to the wrong people.  Look at photos of Mark Warner and that Stalwell guy, and imagine them in SS hats.  Easy to see how it goes from here.  If somebody gets the presidency and decides to go game on, we are the Jews in the whole thing.  Go deep underground, and take as many of them out as possible, should they decide to take you out.

        Our system of government is broken. It is a mathematical certainty that it will fail. The debt accrued due to universal suffrage will come due and either the world will face hyperinflation or default. Either one of the options requires a hard reset.Can we have our revolution before the collapse? It‚Äôs possible I suppose, but I‚Äôd call it extremely unlikely. The ‚Äúright‚Äù, ‚Äúalt right‚Äù or whatever you want to call them needs to position themselves for what comes next and not get too caught up in the vain hope of fixing what is. What do the Brits call it? A shadow government.

                I don‚Äôt know the whole answer, but this must be part of it: The actual, verifiable truth is cognitive abilities are genetic, whites about 100 IQ average and blacks at 85 average (American Blacks).  Mexico averages 90 and Central America 70-80.  Whites Will always dominate a free society.  Any new country simply cannot allow the one-man-one-vote principal or you get tyranny of the low IQ.

            Forming a land-locked country surrounded by blue-hive enemies doesn‚Äôt really sound like a formula for a bright and long lasting future.
I see an awful lot of people on the right going with the ‚Äúnew nation in the heartland‚Äù premise ‚Äì and at the same time spouting the ‚Äúdemographics are destiny‚Äù tagline‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  but I think they‚Äôre forgetting one MAJOR thing:
Geography is destiny too.  Probably more-so than demographics in many cases.
People who have their hearts set on a white nation in the heartland ‚Äì had better start thinking that shit out a little more thoroughly IMHO.

                    Sure about that? Texas is on the razor edge of becoming blue. We are tomorrow‚Äôs California, I think, a once red state flipping all the way over.I‚Äôm kind of with Carlsdad on this one. The parasite of leftism needs to feed on a host, that host is what Nixon called the Silent Majority. Even if it isn‚Äôt the majority in actuality.What will happen, if that happened is we will be surrounded on all sides by rotting failing nation states. Because they need someone to loot, the other side will not let us peacefully leave and we‚Äôre also forgetting that we are too mixed in.If my information is correct, Trump lost Austin, Texas but actually won Staten Island (‚ÄúNew York values‚Äù).We have to be actually realistic about our chances. Heartland America is not some utopia. We‚Äôre basically weak.

                        Assuming that in any future reorganization the state boundries will remain intact.  In Texas, the county red-blue schism is stark.  It‚Äôs likely to remain that way, with red areas remaining red except any near the border and around urban areas.  Continuing that example, Texas hasn‚Äôt always looked like the current ‚ÄúLone Star‚Äù configuration, geographically.

                        The whole premise of a white nation in the heartland just seems like another iteration of the run run run away behavior displayed by so many on right for so long.  Instead of putting their heads down and digging into the real problems and trying to figure out ways to defeat their enemies ‚Äì it‚Äôs just one long train of constant ‚Äúrun and avoid the issues‚Äù type behavior.Show me a landlocked nation that hasn‚Äôt had major issues with their enemies dictating the terms of their very existence.Go look at the history of WW1 and WW2 for crying out loud.  Look at the success of the German Navy vs the British Navy.  Even though Germany is nation with ocean ports ‚Äì they still have MAJOR issues bringing their naval power to bear on the British because of  WHERE their ports were located.The longstanding Russian fight to retain a warm water naval base ‚Äì is another good instructional in how weather and geography dictate your power as a nation.If you think you‚Äôre going to let the blue hives own the coasts while you inhabit the heartland peacefully ‚Äì I think you‚Äôre freaking delusional.Stop thinking you‚Äôre going to click your red shoes together and find a solution in running away to Kansas  ‚Äì wipe that shit from your mind. That way you will have mental power leftover to start considering some REAL solutions.

That Kris Kobach garnered only 43% of the vote speaks volumes.

                                Kansas is full of Mexicans, many illegal.  That‚Äôs how the Democrats took the Governorship.  About 25% demographically.  They spread like a plague upon the land.

                                    To clarify, Kansas is 25% mestizo. The largely Castiian Mexican ruling elite are quietly snickering as we become them,  serving as the containment pond for their excess underclass. Cartel violence cannot kill enough, so to maintain control, avoid uprising without building a social welfare state nightmare (like us)  they vent their undesirables into our society. They have been doing it increasingly for seven or eight decades. We are both their social safety net and a large liquidity pool (remittances) for their economy. Why add on to your house when your (dunce) neighbor keeps letting your distant  relatives sleep over and eat at his house because his bitch wife (leftists) tells at him to do so? That is until they get drunk and shoot him for fun?

                            I wrote a small chapbook of an essay in 2012 entitled, The Next American Revolution . . . will be stillborn.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008XEZGEU/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i5One description of the future is of a USA break up into regional confederations. But the bad news is that the same sort of politicians and businessmen who are in charge now, will be in charge again because the kind of sea change Z Man is talking about needing to occur is unlikely to do so.Whatever govt that has Detroit or Baltimore or Atlanta in its jurisdiction or Phoenix and El Paso is still going to have to operate the same way of a welfare state in the near term.The only thing to change everything will be a general economic and societal collapse where people get very serious and ruthless about survival.

                            The only solution is to stop all immigration, legal and illegal with a few exceptions for highly skilled candidates.  It is too late for that solution.  The country will collapse as more and more subhumans pour into the country because the government is in the hands of the global banking cartel and they have targeted this country for destruction.  The future is brown and dumb.As far as running to a whiter area;  that‚Äôs just intelligent behavior.  The government is infiltrating skinnies and pepperbellies into all white areas as well, however, there is not enough time left before collapse to not be able to kill them all easily.

                Won‚Äôt last anywhere without a change of reference.Lets assume that the old South split off like before, but no civil war this time. How long will that last? Maybe a decade. What will happen is that the Socialist North with its economy now teetering on the brink of ruin will look for an external threat to distract the masses. The socialist mindset always goes this route. Rather than outright war the North will institute guerrilla insurgency along the border. You will never have peace from that point forward as this is the ‚Äòpolitics by other means‚Äô.The liberty side cannot play defense. They would need to engage in economic warfare of their own.

                Folks aren‚Äôt going to get the whole enchilada baring some nightmare scenarios and frankly while we deplorable types are much alike, we aren‚Äôt the only ones here.I suspect many of the Blue hives will be in ruins but we‚Äôll still need to rule a mostly urban society for many yearsOutside of the Constitutional issues, people in Kansas have no more business giving order to Yankees than Yankees do to people in Kansas anywayAlso land locked nations are common and can work especially if the new state invests in self defense. There are plenty of weapons available to government that can make short work of millions as we all knowAlso it will be a semi closed society with tight media controls, censorship and control of all incoming information sources . This is not a good outcome but the Left is fantastically good at subversiongag them or they run you down.

                Where do you think all those mega blue hives get their food from?
Those Hives would become mass graveyards inside of a week if food from the heartland ever ceased. Hell within 48 hours the brownskins and white yuppies would be killing each other over what was available.

                    Agreed. Urbanites have no appreciation for the complexity of the supply chain. Most grocery stores maintain an inventory of three days or less. A trucker‚Äôs strike or a blockade would bring the cities to their knees toot sweet. At that point, things would start getting really vibrant.

            Sorry to rain on your parade, but the Midwest won‚Äôt be that white in a generation or two. Whites only account for ~70% of births in many Midwest states, including Minnesota, Kansas, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio. Some, like Illinois are even lower.
Besides, what makes you think that the most cuck whites in the country will be in favor of blowing apart the United States?

                If Trump pulls off another surprise victory in 2020, and he still might, it would not surprise me to see the secession of several blue states. The left only opposes separatism when we do it, they have never called separatists in Catalonia and Scotland ‚Äúracist‚Äù. Decoupled from bicoastal donors, the Redstan GOP would have Fidesz-level powers and a newly aggressive base. Most victory scenarios for our side depend on leftists jumping the gun.

                    The trouble is that vote harvesting in a few states like Florida, Georgia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, (California, Colorado, NY, and Illinois are already gone), and it doesn‚Äôt matter how the rest of the vote goes.

            Most conservative voters are rather insular by nature, rarely taking interest in the problems of the outside world. While condemned as boorish by our cosmopolitan overclass, I don‚Äôt see what is wrong with ‚Äústaying in your lane‚Äù. So the Middle American voter has to be suckered into NATO and the endless wars, told they are unpatriotic if they think otherwise. This is what Buckley post-war conservatism sees as its role. Stopping the Right from returning to its natural isolationism.

        Every living thing evolves over time, including the macro manifestations of social behavior (culture, politics, economic systems, etc.). Eventually, what persists is what works best in a particular environment, and changing environments motivate changing evolutionary patterns. Today, our dominant environment of affluence and excessive abundance is motivating an evolution toward parasitism and its handmaiden, the extinction of fitness selection. Instead of purging the outliers of the species, we are festering in the cancer of their unbridled growth. That is the underlying phenomenon that is killing us, not a failure of political doctrine.

            Well, I‚Äôve argued somewhere around here that whites are heading down a dead end like the Panda. The drop in fertility, especially among the ruling classes, coincides with material plenty and the collapse in traditional community-wide belief systems. This appears to be true of East Asians too. Just look at Japan and Korea. Even China is showing signs of the rich man‚Äôs disease. The assumption is plenty is the root of the collapse, but I‚Äôm not convinced. Plenty is a relative thing. In other ages, people were living relatively well, but still reproduced.

                Red Foreman is right, it is a spiritual, not material problem.  No belief in something transcendent and you get maximum hedonism in the here and now and no offspring.  Because offspring cost big time money, time, and effort to raise.
If you look at the white sub-populations with high  birth rates, almost all are religiously orthodox/fundy/fanatical.  They have hope for tomorrow, in the afterlife, and for their children‚Äôs children.

                    I agree.  It‚Äôs rather simple: The more ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù you give women (or with divorce laws, power) the less they choose to get married or then have kids.Lower fertility doesn‚Äôt correlate so much with wealth as with female independence, which may go with wealth (Japan) or not (Peru).

                    Trump is rich.  VERY rich.  Tony Randall married a 25 year old woman when he was 75 and had two kids with her when he was 77 and 78 years old. Tony Randall is also quite a bit wealthier than the average person.I am 54 ‚Äì I just had my first son a week ago.  It required medical intervention (on the woman‚Äôs side of things ‚Äì my stuff was tested and worked just fine).  Doing it the way I did it was EXPENSIVE.Using people like Trump, Randall ‚Äì or even me as examples ‚Äì is ludicrous because they are such outliers that they don‚Äôt apply to the circumstances of probably 95% of the total population.You are correct ‚Äì it is THEORETICALLY never too late to get started, but it still takes a willing woman for most men to produce a baby,  and it seems ‚Äúsociety‚Äù ( or the village as Hillary Clinton would call it) ‚Äì has been distinctly uncooperative for a great many men in accomplishing this over the last few decades.There‚Äôs a big difference between theory ‚Äì and reality.Using Trump ‚Äì or Randall as some sort of example , strikes me as the kind of theoretical example favored by global warming alarmists.

                There also weren‚Äôt billions of people on planet Earth and most of the population wasn‚Äôt urban , its 80% in the US and growingThe US in say 1920 the last time population was really growing other than the baby boom bubble  was 100 million, less than 1/3 the population and it was almost entirely in small towns or rural areasHumans like every other animal has a physical and a social carrying capacity and the higher IQ specimens have for the most part exceeded theirsIts healthy and natural for the population to decline and when the numbers are reduced, the social stressors from modernity  are lower and the complexity lower , it will self correct, probably at 1/2 to 1/3 of current numbersYou are not going to get free social capital or to use religious memes to hack the human ecology, the population will  decline . Its a good thing.The only issues is percentage of ethnicity, because of the Middle East/African issue , a population bloom like algae   the European population ratio is off.It should be around 25% and its now around 10% or so. That needs to be corrected though in no way do numbers overall.Humanity could do well with 1/10 the current numbers and swimmingly with 1/5 and could sustain them

                Demographics don‚Äôt lie, this is the issue, all else is just sound and fury signifying nothing. My hypothesis is that it‚Äôs a failure of white males on so many levels in that they failed to maintain control of women.  Women have to be excluded from the workforce and put back into the home having babies and raising children.  Until you figure out how to make that happen you‚Äôre putting the cart before the horse.  Some countries that are majority white have started to make attempts to address that issue and, if they succeed, the rest will follow for them.  These countries still aren‚Äôt going far enough, clearly the franchise needs to be limited for instance and some kind of fixing of the failure of spiritual values.I see nothing in USA going the right way nor anyone with practical solutions to address the issue.  The globalists have an unlimited reserve of fully compliant replacement consumer units to inject into any nation. state.  Let me be clear: there are no technical or operational fixes, this is a spiritual battle yet everyone here appears to imaginine drawing some lines on a map will fix things.

                    I must politely disagree that its a spiritual malaise in that with a population of a a quarter billion Whites in the US alone we in no way shape or form need more.We need less of them and a change of leadership but allowing population to decline at a natural pace is a good thingThe human population will come down one way or another, there is not going to be an escape velocity not a colonial effort. We have overshot our physical carrying capacityIn the end if we allow population to decline while keep a homogeneous population this means less of our kind need starve to death or die of plagues or violence  over resourcesEven if somehow we manage to get past the material limits, human happiness will be higher with less peopleHalf of Europe‚Äôs malaise is caused by being choc a bloc with citiesOregon is growing  miserable and crowded with 1/15th the population density of Germany!

        It should also never be forgotten that Buckley Conservatism was, overwhelmingly, fixated on the idea of opposing the USSR and its frightening expansionism. Domestic issues were never more than a distraction ‚Äì for example, both Barry Goldwater and WFB opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but pretty much abandonded this opposition when the Commies started to score propaganda points with it.  Buckley Conservatism had a good reason for being, but it lost it  after 1991, and NR should have just declared victory and gone home, leaving the field free for a new kind of conservatism to arise, more in tune with the needs of the times. But of course, there was a lot of money at stake, so this didn‚Äôt happen. Kind of like what happened with the charity set up to fight polio called ‚ÄúThe March of Dimes‚Äù. Polio is long gone, at least in the US, but, of course, the charity is still with us. Old Cold War institutions like NR, NATO, and USAID all need to go ‚Äì they are about as relative to current problems as the Freedmans‚Äô Bureau, or the Continental Congress.

Thanks for the laugh. Buckley was a CIA tool, a believer in big government and the expansion of the American Empire.
Which came first, the Warsaw Pact or NATO?
If you were frightened by ‚Äúfrightening expansionism‚Äù  your fears were directed at the wrong target. By means of CIA operations like Mockingbird.

                You‚Äôre wrong. Buckley was a tool, CIA or otherwise, but Communism was and is a muderous expansionist philosophy. Some things are true, even though Buckley said them. The attempt to whitewash communism by some on the Alt-Right, just because the US was expansionsit as well, never ceases to amaze me.

                    The US foreign policy establishment spent the first half of the Cold War more concerned with dismantling European colonialism than containing the USSR. A futile propaganda effort for the ‚Äúhearts and minds‚Äù of Third World intellectuals.

        I like the term ‚Äúneoliberalism‚Äù to describe our current bipartisan ruling regime, but I‚Äôve struggled to describe it. I think I have a good conceptualization after reading this post. Make a Venn diagram, one circle for Mittens Rmoney and one for Hillary Rotherham Klinton. Wherever they overlap, there is your neoliberalism: open borders; free trade; bankster capitalism; blind support for Israel; subversion, prison, or wars for any who resist Globo-gayplex.From a distance, it appears as one solid circle. On closer inspection you find trifling issues which really aren‚Äôt that important. That‚Äôs where you find our Tweedle-Dee/Tweedle Dum political debates. Hillary wants your guns. Mittens will let you keep a .38 and a duck gun. Mittens is less enthusiastic about a woman‚Äôs right to kill, but his SCROTUS justices will be trucons who believe in the sacred ‚ÄúStare Decisis‚Äù and will never touch abortion (or affirmative action, or any issue of free association because ‚Äúmuh precedents‚Äù). The NPC‚Äôs on both sides think the handful of issues they‚Äôre allowed to argue actually matter to the TPTB. As they squabble we slide further into the belly of the Beast.

        Nothing to disagree with here but I think it a waste of time to talk about what ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù believe.  Since Hoover there haven‚Äôt enough of them who weren‚Äôt complete liars to matter.  Maybe the slobbering over HW has me in this mood.The full quote from HW Bush‚Äôs famous campaign speech:‚ÄúThe truth is, this election is about the beliefs we share, the values we honor, the principles we hold dear‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm the one who won‚Äôt raise taxes. My opponent now says he‚Äôll raise them as a last resort, or a third resort. When a politician talks like that, you know that‚Äôs one resort he‚Äôll be checking into. My opponent won‚Äôt rule out raising taxes. But I will. The Congress will push me to raise taxes, and I‚Äôll say no, and they‚Äôll push, and I‚Äôll say no, and they‚Äôll push again, and I‚Äôll say to them, ‚ÄúRead my lips: no new taxes.‚ÄùCatch that line? ‚Äú‚Ä¶the principles we hold dear‚Ä¶‚Äù?‚Äùhttps://spectator.org/34257_speaker-george-hw-bush/It sounded great, won Bush the election in a landslide ‚Äì and was a total lie.  He immediately threw out the Reagonites and raised taxes.  Since then, conservatism has been the same bait and switch.  They run on small government then govern like FDR.  They don‚Äôt believe in anything except a lucrative career in government.

        No conservative philosophy will ever see a pragmatic chance in hell at being implemented in the Democratic globalists institutionalize their oppression by taking over the presidency, senate, and house in the next couple election cycles. Once that happens, the game is over, and conservatives will be prohibited from even discussing it online without being hit with the coming social credit scores aka China.

        The failure of the Alt-Right has to be kept in perspectiveThe Alt-Right was mostly a meta-political movement, that aimed to change the culture.Nobody believed that Richard Spencer was going to become an elected official.The culture‚Ä¶ of certain segments of the population has changed quite a bit, to where we are seeing White Nationalist topics being discussed on many conservative sites that did not previously discuss them.That‚Äôs not entirely due to the ‚ÄúAlt-Right‚Äù and it‚Äôs certainly not something that E-celebs directly accomplished themselves. But the Alt-Right as a broad unorganized current probably helped.The reason things are looking less optimistic nowadays is related to the complete collapse of Trump-ism and MAGA Conservatism.Few predicted Trump would be this ineffective when elected. Few predicted the complete failure of a civic nationalism to materialize as a thing.The Alt-Right and White Nationalism are post-democratic and not at all suited to become politicians in a multi-racial democracy. But Trump conservatism didn‚Äôt actually become a thing either.So we find ourselves in an interesting situation where we are seeing significant cultural change, but without any real prospect of political representation and increasingly direct repression under a Republican administration that has no interest in doing anything about it.

        Z man, I‚Äôm sure you have heard the long standing rumor that the CIA funded the start-up of *National Review* in 1956.  The CIA wanted to create a ‚Äúrespectable‚Äù conservative alternative to the John Birch Society.  The J. B. Society was roughly and sort of the Alt Right of the1950‚Äôs and ‚Äô60‚Äôs.Furthermore, the go-between  between the CIA and young Bill Buckley is said to have been  James Burnham.  Burnham‚Äôs book, *The Managerial Revolution* is almost a Bible of the Imperial American Big Government-Big Business complex.James Burnham was an American philosopher and political theorist. Burnham was a prominent Trotskyist activist in the 1930s, as well as a well-known isolationist. In later years Burnham left Marxism and became a public intellectual of the American conservative movement. His book The Managerial Revolution, published in 1941, speculated on the fate of capitalism. Burnham was also an editor and a regular contributor to the American conservative publication National Review on a variety of topics.See more on en.wikipedia.org ¬∑

Paddy Chayefsky, of Network fame, treated Gore so rotten that Vidal asked William Wyler what the point of it was.Wyler told Gore, ‚ÄúPaddy thinks movies are an all-Jewish game, and you ain‚Äôt no Jew!‚Äù That was in the 1950s.

        The first step toward a break is identity politics. It‚Äôs already dogma for the neoliberals, depending on whose identity. We can see the effectiveness by the hysteria when identity is claimed by the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù group.
Start with identity and everything follows: culture, politics, and economics.
The beginning of the argument is simple. I refuse to apologize for being white.

            The problem is convincing the Trump-supporting people that we (whites) have to embrace identity politics. I really don‚Äôt think the vast majority of them have been presented with our solid argument that ‚Äúall other ethnic groups play it, and will crush the whites due to demographic force if whites don‚Äôt play it.‚ÄùInstead they‚Äôre listening to guys like Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Charlie Kirk, Dinesh D‚ÄôSouza, Tomi Lahren, etc. all denounce identity politics, and push feel-good color-blind MLK crap.  Because our argument is so good, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that difficult to convert these good-intentioned patriotic MAGA folks.  The difficulty is that there‚Äôs so many of them, and not enough of us.

        In all likelihood the only major challenge to neoliberalism, in a decade‚Äôs time, will be some new mutation of Leninism. Corbyn is the obvious example from the UK. Whites that survive will have to mimic the diaspora, and the first behavior of the mimic will have to be turning a savage new population against the existing managerial class.

Normally, if allowable differences become very small, then non-allowable differences become numerous, large, and, well, diverse. Exactly the kind of place where a new paradigm can appear. But maybe that is what you are saying (in the following paragraph).I don‚Äôt know about equating libertarianism with Rand‚Äôs objectivism. Didn‚Äôt she herself deny that? I suppose objectivism might be considered the cartoon version of libertarianism‚Ä¶Anyway, what is liberalism, conservatism and libertarianism?

        There was the other side of the problem, there was no ‚ÄúThe Conservative case for a large, nuclear family‚Äù.  Or ‚Äúfor not disrupting stable small towns‚Äù.I see complaints that small town newspapers are either disappearing or are just being run by very remote hedge funds so aren‚Äôt responsive to anything but profit.  But somehow unlike factory workers or coal miners, no one is telling them they need U-Haul.  (I‚Äôm waiting for NR to either become the captive toady of someone like the Koch brothers, like Cato is, or disappears).NR and Conservatism Inc benefited for a while from the duopoly ‚Äì sort of like Coke v.s. Pepsi.  When you didn‚Äôt have the internet, there were some small specialty publications (RC and Faygo), but mostly you had one or the other side, and until the end of the cold war, they limited their purges.When the internet first democratized information and opinion and reporting, they were doomed.  Right now, Big Data is trying to stuff the Genie back into the bottle, but it won‚Äôt fitI read a complaint (by a clueless elite lefty) that Facebook was causing the Paris trouble.  No, it just lets them organize.  If Facebook cut them off, they would move to another platfomr en masse.But what comes next?  A return to Christendom or a Dark Age.  You can see it with the progression ‚Äì Socialism wants wealth without freedom, but it doesn‚Äôt work, so you trace back to libertarianism.  But that doesn‚Äôt work without a culture (all the AnCap security/insurance stuff is as much nonsense as the Socialist 5 year plans to build factories and railroads).  Culture gets you to (the greater) alt-Right (Vox Day‚Äôs description).  But that too isn‚Äôt quite the root you need to recover.  It involves Graeco-Roman law and philosophy, but also Christendom, and even that only Europeans seem to work, and mostly Northern Europeans (Why did the Euro Bonds having trouble come from Greece, Italy, Spain, and Portugal, with Ireland as the outlier ‚Äì known as PIIGS).

        Almost all let‚Äôs-imagine-a-perfect-society projects start with a list of axioms or postulates.  ‚ÄúWe hold these truths to be self-evident‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe usual thinking is that any person of  good will would accept the axioms, because they are self evident.  That‚Äôs probably more a definition of what one means by good will than it is of anything else.The usual assumption is that all the good outcomes one could hope for would necessarily  tumble out of these axioms when they are mixed together, just as everything we do in geometry comes from a handful of statements we don‚Äôt bother to try to prove, because we cannot,In casting about for what comes after conservatism, we need to be aware of the effort we put into axioms that are supposed to produce  ‚Äî surprise, surprise ‚Äî  just the results we want.

        Pre-enlightenment is the new post-enlightenment.
Chambers was quite the visionary ‚Äì he saw all of this coming long before his contemporaries. But the farther back you go, the more people you‚Äôll find who knew the score. Filmer and Carlyle are good places to start for literate people who want to break from the intellectual prison of Locke and Mill.

Why do people here like to skew names?  It‚Äôs so pervasive that it‚Äôs starting to freak me out a little.  It really requires an explanation.  Is it something to do with older, left-brained men?   You guys find it endlessly humorous.
