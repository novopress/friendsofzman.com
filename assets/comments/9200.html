        Eh, I think the fountain of youth stuff is vain and temporary.  It is all ego and full of downsides with little in the way of redeeming value.  Thinking man can alter God‚Äôs creation and plan is a bit much for this guy.  Like the old margarine commercial said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not nice to fool with Mother Nature!‚ÄùWhen you broached this subject, my first thought was energy.  We, as a world, are still in need of a major overhaul, major innovation in energy production.  Cheap energy that would be widely available and eliminate lots of conflicts around the world.  Then water.  Clean water, especially in places that lack abundant natural sources.  I have always believed that historically peoples moved to where these key resources where and did not have ‚Äúroots‚Äù to geography that they would die for through drought and thirst.  You move to where the water is.  But with so many people, that is not as possible.  And then the issue becomes clean, potable water in quantities to support large populations.Technologies in these two areas are daunting and ripe for technological challenge and innovation and investment.  Never mind going to Mars, however, some of these problems just might find solutions in that effort.  So you never know.  Scientific discovery is kinda of serendipitous in that regard.  You never really know what you‚Äôre gonna get.  If only the Climate Change prophets could deal with real world science, their goal of solving environmental problems would take a huge step forward.  Taxing our way out of things is not the way to do it.  Or enriching a few playing a scam is not a good deal either, i.e. Al ‚ÄúI invented the internet‚Äù Gore.

            Water! My 36 yr old engineer son did 6 yrs on an offshore oil drilling platform and has just launched a water systems biz, well-drilling being the main component. We‚Äôve been planning this for years. We‚Äôre convinced it‚Äôll be more and more of the coming thing, especially in the Southern Cone, where it‚Äôs badly needed.

        ‚ÄúIs there anyone who would not buy a pill that makes you look as good as you looked in the flower of youth?‚Äù
Present and accounted for! No pills, no surgery, no hair dye. B.B. King had it right: ‚ÄúNow Father Time is catching up with me/ Gone is my youth/ I look in the mirror everyday/ And let it tell me the truth‚Äù.
The great rewards of old age are wisdom and serenity if one allows passions to subside per the natural course of events.

            Pill or no pill, some of us didn‚Äôt look that good to start with. I did, of course, üòâ  but some of us, no.  Since you brought up B. B. King:  if one allows the passions to subside there is no blues.

            I agree on the cosmetic front, although I‚Äôm 62 and barely going gray, much less losing my hair, and not too many wrinkles, so I may not be the one to ask. As for fixing my chassis, I‚Äôd sign up. My eyes are bad- I‚Äôd be happy with the ones I had when I was 20. I still enjoy playing hockey and golf, and if I could fix stuff to continue I would.

                I lucked out. Never good looking, went mostly bald in my late 20s, and not great socially. But started off physically near perfect, and it lasted until I was near 80. Enabled me to have and support a fine family, enjoy career as an aviator, and have a long post-retirement consultantship which brought in a fair amount of change. Only in my mid-80s have things begun to go downhill a little. Last spring I had to hire out my lawncare. Broke my heart.

        Transportation/logistics are the next big area of landscape-changing innovation.  The Post Office is a leading indicator of the anachronism that is 20th century logistics and transport.  I suspect that shopping malls will be converted into tree lined parks and entertainment complexes (mini Disney‚Äôs) in my lifetime.What made the iPod and iPhone into the globe-shattering tech phenomena that they are?  They took 6 devices and collapsed them into one‚Ä¶which worked better than any of the six except cameras for a short time, but that has been surpassed as well.  They also completely democratized software, media, etc.  It‚Äôs a device that operates entirely on my terms.The physical consumer-word is still collapsing, but the real value of land and property still exists.  It‚Äôs just sitting there waiting for somebody to figure out how to abandon 20th century mindsets of destination shopping and become the plug and play cruise ships that don‚Äôt go anywhere.  The person who figures out the logistics, security, entertainment, food, lodging, etc to take that half empty mall-of-crap, and turn it into Mainstreet USA complete with nostalgia, food, shopping.entertainment, a place people can go to get what they want in their terms but without having to defeat six consumer logistics hurdles (air/ground transportation, lodging, meals, entertainment (thrills, experiences), family management, security).  There are places trying (Dave and Busters, for example), but these places suffer from high turnover due to poor logistics and low quality‚Ä¶and you‚Äôre still stuck with the stuff they want to provide‚Ä¶not the stuff everybody wants to do.When I got my first iPod in 2007, overnight I no longer needed: CDs/player, something to carry them in, a larger bag, GPS device, laptop for web/email, separate phone, separate chargers and batteries for everything, etc.).The all-inclusive resorts and cruises have the right idea, but their logistics to operate‚Ä¶and more importantly the traveler-logistics to GET TO these locations‚Ä¶is prohibitive.  A friend of mine is a DVC member, but when it comes to the resorts, she has reached Peak Disney.  It‚Äôs such a hassle now, and the crowds are so bad, that she is probably not going to renew.The innovator who figures how to bring the climate (sun, beaches, etc) of a destination resort to the customer ‚Äì and can defeat the logistics demon (power, especially) necessary to sustain profitability ‚Äì wins.And don‚Äôt leave energy out of the equation.  It‚Äôs really central to everything.  Fracking is every bit the earth-shattering technology we hope it would be.  It has brought OPEC and the Saudis to their knees.  It has brought down the Marxist/fascist government in Venezuela.  As a country, buying energy from other parts of the world is now unnecessary‚Ä¶basically charity.But, as we are seeing in places like North Dakota, logistics rule the day.  Everybody in America would have an electric car but for two reasons: not enough power plants, and a rickety logistics distribution system, bulwarked by a monopolized (Government) public utilities infrastructure which has little or no incentive to modernize, and which is hostage to the Greens.The two greatest technological and logistics advances of my lifetime happened within 5 years of a major government deregulation: the airlines, and breaking up Ma Bell.  The first one broke down huge cost barriers to travel, airlines proliferated, safety improved, UPS, FEDEX, etc‚Ä¶all flowed from deregulation.And breaking up Ma Bel led to wireless communications, and the entirety of the internet.We do that with energy and healthcare‚Ä¶look out.

                HBO‚Äôs Westworld is a very creepy vision of a possible robot future.
As for future tech, I would think the next big leap for mankind would be teleportation. You can only make an aircraft or trains so big and so fast and even self driving cars are prone to traffic jams. Even space travel doesn‚Äôt seem to be such much of a challenge given we can get things on Mars on a more or less routine basis.
If the current generation can get past their narcissist iPhone/Smartphone addiction, anything is possible.

        I don‚Äôt have a big desire to live longer than average.  I would, however, pay significant money to remain strong, alert, and active during the next 25 or 30 years.  (I‚Äôm 50)  There are a lot of things I‚Äôd still like to do that require cooperation from my body.
It would be a nice change of pace just to exercise until my muscles are exhausted instead of going until my joints are sore.

        Interesting point about insurance. My wife has Huntington‚Äôs disease in her family. At one point, after the third of her 3 brothers was diagnosed with HD we went through the testing protocols-  our results were good, thankfully. One thing the doctor said that caught my attention, and this was nearly 20 years ago, was that HD testing was the thin end of the wedge, and that soon (dunno what soon means, exactly) they‚Äôd be able to predict a person‚Äôs medical future with a high degree of certainty. In that case, hello National Health Service!As for the robot future, we know that ‚Äúsomething will go horribly wrong‚Ä¶‚Äù

            Health insurance is mostly just a inter-generational lay-a-way plan these days, but the concept of health insurance will not survive the genomic age. We‚Äôre not far from the point where a simple test can determine your probability of getting cancer, heart disease, dementia, etc. From there it is just a matter of putting a price tag next to each risk and figuring your probable health costs over a lifetime. At that point, we‚Äôre no longer talking about insurance. It‚Äôs a matter of allocating funds from you or society in order to cover your maintenance and repair costs.The next great public policy debate with regards to health care will not be over insurance. We‚Äôre just waiting for people to realize that insurance in a myth. The next debate is over how to reduce the price of health services. That means deregulation of health services so supply can shoot up and prices can fall.

                It‚Äôs not just the tests, it‚Äôs the treatments which are just mind bogglingly effective.  You talk to old doctors today, guys in their 70‚Äôs, they‚Äôll tell you how boring medicine is today in many general practice types of fields.  Most of the big issues have been solved.  They spend most of their time dealing with hypochondriacs and other mental cases.  Really tough issues are usually genetic in nature or by-products of our overabundance of things like food, easy access to drugs, and over-allocation of psychotropic medications.  They spend a fair amount of time titrating people‚Äôs lithium drips‚Ä¶for things that people just learned to live with.I have a medicine for my occasional outbreaks of basil cell carcinoma which is basically just a topical cream.  It‚Äôs like something out of Star Trek, no surgery.  Migraines?  I have a pill for that.  15 minutes‚Ä¶aaaaand‚Ä¶it‚Äôs gone.  20 years ago, the migraines might go on for 3 days and kill my weekend.Insurance is probably heading more towards (or back to) the automobile model of insurance.  You pay it in case you have a wreck, but all the other stuff about your car you just go to the mechanic to pay for yourself, or you just put a rag in the gas tank and duct tape the windows and keep driving‚Ä¶

                Well, the interesting thing is on the P&amp;C side, when we look at a portfolio of say, 50,000 dwelling units, we know far more from location, age, construction, elevation, roof type, occupancy etc about the probabilities of loss across the pool and can assign fairly specific rates to different tranches of risk.  And the available data just gets richer each year.  In fact we really can‚Äôt evolve modeling fast enough to account for new available factors. From what I know of the health side of the business, there is a paucity of similar data‚Äìthey can‚Äôt really see that deeply into individual risk, especially with the high turnover rates in the exposure base (conversely we might turn a portfolio of high end homes at only 6-7% per year).  Privacy is the big barrier to a free flow of information (for obvious reasons).  However, genetic data would allow for calculation of ‚Äúcost of ownership‚Äù and I suppose an equitable premium could be worked out to cover excess or fortuitous (think accidents) losses.  A few years ago had an interesting dinner discussion with some members of the Watson team that worked on the first cancer treatment models.   I asked how hard it would be to tune the recommendation algorithms for treatment to include a version of economic value added based on estimated additional lifespan, patient profession etc.  ‚ÄúNot that hard‚Äù was the answer.  Followup question was ‚Äúdo you have an ethicist on your project team‚Äù.  Answer, ‚Äúno‚Äù.

        I don‚Äôt know, times are changing I guess. My cell phone bill runs less than $10 per year; most of the time it sits in my desk drawer on top of its battery.  I‚Äôm too cheap to make a glass case for it that reads ‚ÄòBreak glass in case of emergency‚Äô.Hospitals are the most dangerous places on Earth, I‚Äôm seventy years old and haven‚Äôt had a checkup since my discharge from the Marines back in 1968.  Doctors certainly are well educated and informed, but nevertheless, their literature is filled with assumptions half truths.  Giving them control over my health is still pretty much a crap shoot.There is no longer any real option remaining for a computer operating system that is well supported but distinct from marketing networks such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, etc.  Linux works, but most of the code is such a hack job that it cannot be trusted; still, I use it, knowing that it may be all that‚Äôs left.Self driving cars rank right up there with cell phones in my estimation.  I like driving cars, but I hate riding in cars. No matter where I go, there I am; it isn‚Äôt going someplace that‚Äôs enjoyable, the challenge is enjoying where you are. Being trapped with a cell phone in a robotic vehicle simply fails to fulfill my romantic aspirations.Television and radio have long ago lost their appeal, primarily due to advertising. The Internet is rapidly falling in line behind the radio and TV. Email, usenet and some blogs are still useful, but I don‚Äôt see a great future their either.Space travel is the next great adventure. Freeing ourselves from the constraints of the planet Earth is really the next horizon to be conquered.  We all know that the Sun, Earth, planets and moons in our solar system have a finite lifetime and that if we don‚Äôt move on, mankind will cease to exist.  Instead, we focus on population control, automated transportation, required health maintenance and many other constraints due to overcrowding. Freedom, individuality, self-expression and adventure are all suffering as we shove ourselves into our little automated boxes with attached tubes for air, water, food and waste removal.We need to do more of what we have always done; pull up our pants, put on our boots, rocket ourselves to Mars and see what kind of world we can make for ourselves there, Meeting and succeeding unknown challenges brings its own rewards; facing challenges we create for ourselves is OK, but kind of like dating your sister, it will get you no where.

        George Carlin paraphrased Russel Kirk when he said that most people work just hard enough to not get fired, and get paid just enough not to quit. Alfred E Neuman is always waiting just around the corner. When we see lifespans double we will also see half the effort. Civilizations advance in urgency, die in leisure.

        Two thoughts.
On Nanotech ‚Äì you have to improve optics and be able to somehow visualize the tiny particles so that you can completely manipulate nano-scale materials.
On Genetics/ Biotech ‚Äì you need victims/subjects to do actual moderate to high risk research on human beings to make the scientific knowledge sufficiently detailed to get approved products on the market.

        Genetics, disease, and personalized medicine. We‚Äôre only beginning to understand the connections between a person‚Äôs genetic makeup, the types of diseases they will develop, and how to treat the disease.Different types of cancer use different techniques to hide from the host body‚Äôs immune system. We will likely all develop some form of cancer if we live long enough. The particular type of cancer a person develops is in large part a function of their genetic makeup, as is the effectiveness of a particular treatment. Keytruda (pembrolizumab) cured Jimmy Carter‚Äôs cancer, but is ineffective for other people, most likely due to a combination of the form of cancer and the person‚Äôs genetic makeup.We‚Äôre in the initial phases of mapping cancer data against genetic data to determine the genetic markers which indicate what type of cancer a person is likely to develop and what checkpoint inhibitors might be useful in treating their cancer. Cancer will become a treatable illness rather than a death sentence.

        The odd thing about the ‚Äú23 and me‚Äù deal is that it refutes all the CSI crapola in TV,  movies, and books. My wife sent in their spit-cup-full of saliva for her test and it was rejected as ‚Äúnot enough DNA‚Äù. When all the fictional DNA analyses work on one hair. The saliva on a cigarette butt.
Just goes to show how easy science really is when you know the answer you want and work backwards to the evidence. Climate change science is easy in the same way.

            My favorite in this regard is when the cops find some brass as a crime scene or pull a slug from a body. magically, they locate the exact gun and owner. The female coroner always says something like, ‚ÄúYour shooter used a Ruger purchased in New Jersey last week.‚Äù In reality, no crime has ever been solved using a slug or shell casing. The most you can tell is the probability that the slug came from a gun that you found and believe is the weapon used in the crime. But, you have to actually have the gun first and in those cases, you have the guy anyway.

        I‚Äôve read they know what causes gray hair &amp; will be able to do something about it. According to the article:
Our hair turns gray only because the hair follicle begins bleaching our hair with Hydrogen Peroxide the follicle creates as we age. Turn that off &amp; the hair grows its natural color. They also have some positive results in tests of drugs expected to counter that. One or more drugs used to treat Vitiligo.

        The odds we will find a way to be forever young are poor. We may find ways to add a few more years to lifespan and make those years more productive but we are biologically program to die eventually.The ‚Äònext big thing‚Äô is the EM drive that will allow us to travel at meaningful speed inside our solar systemand make use of the resources available to us. EM drives could cut transit times to places like Mars from18 months to a few weeks. That makes exploring the solar system viable for manned craft. EM drives won‚Äôtmake interstellar travel for humans practical but it could mean we could visit other stars with drone craftin a time frame where we could receive information from these drones after just a few decades instead ofcenturies or milleniaa.
