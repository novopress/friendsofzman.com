        More likely that the Empire strikes back when we discover that genetic fiddling comes with unintended consequences like an increase in susceptibility to some disease. i wonder who gets sued when the genetically sculpted 35 year olds all come down with liver cancer. Would you sue your parents for “choosing poorly”?

            I almost wrote that down, but then thought that the temptation to have your kids be everything you aren’t is just too great.  It’s like the benzene in gasoline.  Every time you get some on your hands or inhale a whiff, you are ingesting a non-trivial carcinogen.  But no one makes a big noise about it because what would we do without gasoline?

        Of course they are going to start messing with the germ line.  Why else would the big biotech companies be patenting human genes? (I’m too lazy to read the USSC decision, but the equally lazy and poorly written summaries I found on the net indicate that your and my genes can’t be patented, but the same genes made in a lab can be patented.  Which seems to mean they can be patented.)  Why would they sponsor “learn your genetic heritage” giveaways through corporate cutouts?  Because they want to help everyone celebrate their diversity?My prediction: within 25 years, designer babies will be available to the upper middle classes with prices dropping rapidly.  Everyone will have an IQ of over 130.  Skin color will vary from coffee with cream to “Rhineland German golden tan.”  Ebony and ivory will be out.  Everyone will have blue or green eyes.  Hair color will vary, but my guess is that most people will be born blond.  Men will all be over 6′ 2″ with builds varying from triathlete through Mr Olympia and with at least an 8″ pecker.  Women will all be between 5′ 8″ and 5′ 10″ with triathlete to bikini model builds and will all have a least a C-cup.  There will be no ugly, fat or skinny people because those traits will be redefined as diseases.Of course I am likely to be right as any other fool in the innerwebs.  But if it does happen, what happens next?  Genetic arms race?  Anti-biotech jihad?  Or the end of history as everyone just hangs out, digs each others’ groovy bods, and parties?
