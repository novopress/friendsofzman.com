        No surprise that today’s Phd given a high school test from the 19th century fails miserably.  And, on a philosophical note, I agree with R. G. Collingwood, though he stated it more elegantly, that Science is a bastard child of Religion.  (Religion, in turn, is a bastard child of Art.)  Looking at it from the viewpoint that these are “Stages on Life’s Way”.
