        The fact that this country is lost, and no longer the USA of 1980, 1990 or even 2000, is something I have been well aware of here in Tampa for many years.I live in a formally white what would of been considered middle to lower middle class neighborhood which is now gentrifying all around with the new lefty yuppies and gays.But my section and all around  me is Hispanic.  Many new, many with zero English.  The culture is definitely like South America.  The neighborhood looks like South America.  It’s crazy.But one thing I think is lost on the left wingers in this nation.  My neighbors are strong family people.  All have kids, for the most part are Christian centric and have one huge gigantic thing bubbling underneath,  they cannot stand blacks.  Hate them, hate everything about them, from the handout mentality to the totally absent of fathers.Will this eventually swing the vote to at least a more conservative cultural look in government?  I don’t know.  But it is a palatable situation and it appears, at least in my neck of the woods, Hispanics are completely sick of it.

            I think a lot of us tend to see the negative in everything so people have been worried about Blue state migrants Californicating their new homes. There’s some of that but my impression is that it’s largely people who were simply tolerating the Leftism of their states realizing, after the Coof, that the lunatics had won and it was time to go. The Great Migration is a blessing if it leads more people to realize it’s time to end the failed “American Experiment”.

            That Oregon secession thing for 3/4 to split off and join Idaho is a good idea, but really it would be better to just detonate a nuclear weapon over Portland and then take 100% of the state.  And I say this knowing full well that doing so would mean replacing all my windows and living in the basement for two weeks.

        Eh, I think when Z goes full paywall I’m gonna bail. Been in this thing for long to see most enterprises turning opinion into profit tend to go pear-shaped really quickly. Best of luck, of course, but not gonna pay for ideological musings.

            That’s a good question for several reasons, not the least of being it is hard to get accurate information. All wars are full of propaganda but this one is off the charts and neutral, accurate information is scarce. The best I can tell is there is something of a stalemate with the Russians slowly grinding down the Ukrainians, with Westerners more and more filtering into the mix. It’s like the Spanish Civil War in that narrow sense but mentally retarded, with Ivan the adult in the room.It seriously looks like it will be end with the same results of the peace agreement of nine years ago, with the West much poorer and Russia’s military degraded.

For a good representation of the goings on there, a you tube channel called “The Duran” has what appears to be accurate info on a daily basis.
To give you a visual, think of when Tommy (Russia) put that guys head in a vise (Ukraine), until his eye popped out.
Sums it up.

            There’s a Youtube channel called “Military Summary” that gives detailed daily updates on the situation by comparing Russian and western military sources.  The fellow’s name is Dima and he is based in Belarus.  It can get tedious at times, but if watched regularly, you get a sense of how things are developing.

        First of all, I object to the disparagement of long hair and mutton chop sideburns. Next thing you know this blog will be slandering the ’83 Olds Cutlass.The assertion that the present day West has no organizing civilizational culture is false. The West’s civilizational culture is sexual perversion. It is not a question of whether or not this culture will prevail or gain dominance. It has already gained dominance. Objectors are unpersoned. It has its own flag, which is now the empire’s true flag. Flown by every US embassy around the world. At the homes and churches of its adherents back home. They haven’t figured out a way to get rid of the old stars and stripes flag yet, but will as soon as practicable. Because they hate it, like a disease.If you disagree with me that this is the west’s dominant culture, I invite you to go out and speak loudly against it and watch what happens. It’s not a question of what the west’s dominant culture will be, that has already been established. It is a question of how long this newly dominant culture will last. I don’t think the answers are as easy as we might like them to be.Most people’s world view, dissidents included, is in the past, because the past is a lot easier to see than the present. This shows up in a lot of things. Markets for instance. 99% of people’s view of the market is based on what has has already happened, not on what is happening now. If it has already gone up, they think we are in a bull market. If it has already gone down, they think we are in a bear market. Neither view has anything to do with where it’s going right now or tomorrow. I use this analogy to illustrate that it’s usually the same way with world history as a whole. As Zman pointed out talking about the Berlin wall coming down. The week or month or year before, almost no one realized we were in a new era. So it is with civilizational culture.Huntingdon was right about civilization culture, but even he couldn’t anticipate clown world. Who could?

            “It’s not a question of what the west’s dominant culture will be, that has already been established. It is a question of how long this newly dominant culture will last. I don’t think the answers are as easy as we might like them to be.”The answer to this question is – INDEFINITELY.  The major difference to here and the Soviet Union, for example, is the Soviet Union was still a mostly homogenous nation (nearly all white) and the people shared a common set of values and culture.  That is not the case here.I started saying to friends lately that there is no such thing as an “American”.  They all think I am a crackpot.  They look at me strange just like they did when I first told them that you would have your bank account taken away if you had the wrong think or voted the “wrong” way 5 years ago.  People like us are country-less men.  There is no such thing as the “United States of America”.  It’s a massive, resource rich piece of land with free trade across state lines filled with warring tribes who hate each other.  Urban areas are unlivable slums contaminated by blax and rural areas are being infiltrated and destroyed by a government that hates the normal citizens of the land.I think if you asked a young person to define what it means to be an American, they’d probably raise a rainbow flag or BLM flag and say “Fuck White People!”.

                    I suspect that there were Celts/Gauls saying something similar as the Frankish tribe displaced them.  Now it’s France, not Gaul.  And it’s England (land of the Angles), not Brittania.

With bluster like this the tides will change by breakfast time tomorrow. We are saved!I look forward to hearing your plans, ‘kemosabe’. Given your interesting definition of things that are yours, and all. Let me see… 60 years of discrimination against Whites called affirmative action…. millions of mud men flowing across the deliberately open southern border…. open perversion of justice targeting White dissidents ( James Fields, J6, Derek Chauvin et al)… White kids openly assaulted by savages in our schools with Anarcho-tyrants standing by to severely punish any that fight back….rapidly declining numbers of the White population…Indian grifters announcing plans to run for the Presidency amid enthusiastic applause from the thoroughly, utterly, and irretrievably brainwashed White peasant population…  yup! All this must mean it’s YOURS!Nice country ya got here,  ‘ kemosabe’! This is levels of Boomer cringe that should not even be possible.Oh, and my ancestors arrived here in 1754 and built a place that still thrives with businesses and tourism today. But the guy who told you we are men without a country was right, so sorry.Nothing is ‘yours’ that you cannot hold.

            Thesis:  “The West’s civilizational culture is sexual perversion.”Antithesis:  But that doesn’t include the fanatical anti-whiteness, which seems to have a longer and deeper history than the promotion of sexual perversion and the intensity is at least as great.Synthesis:  The West’s civilization culture is anti-traditional white male.

I don’t think the answers are as easy as we might like them to be.”True, and I would despair if I agreed with Tired Citizen that the answer is “indefinitely.” I don’t agree, though, because everything already is fragmenting and fracturing. Additionally, in theory this hideous culture could last a long time, but as we see with the psychotic taunting of Russia to let the nukes fly, the suicidal impulse runs deep so under any circumstances its time is limited. The USSR had a 70-year lifespan because it was not as destructive as this current iteration and technology was not available to circumvent the state.It could take longer, but I seriously doubt this thing staggers on past this decade. That might not even be the best result, either, since nuclear annihilation is one possible endpoint. It’s rather ironic that those who rant about the Earth dying in 20 years from climate change totally ignore it may be vaporized next week, but they run this show.

        I have not heard one reply that stated exactly what makes civilization. We do not presently have one. Indians never had one as well. A city of tall buildings nor modern technology are not evidence of civilization. There will no be much of a future anywhere until you understand the civilizing forces and whether you want them.

        Speaking of the New World Order, the conspiracy people really poisoned that phrase.  By the turn of the century, anyone using the term to try and fight against New World Order envisaged by the managerial class would be branded a nut job.  But is’ an example of a conspiracy that is literally true.  The old world order of a bipolar world had failed and the managerial elite wanted to create a new unipolar world order with the Western managerial elite in charge of everything.I remember reading all the articles in the 2000s and early 2010s about how China was getting rich with our production equipment and that by getting rich they would embrace liberal democracy.  This one mistake alone should disqualify the entire managerial elite from doing anything but most menial tasks society needs done.  They should be pushing brooms and cleaning up the human waste on the streets courtesy of the homeless in our formerly great cities.  Instead, they are planning a war with China oblivious to the fact that we cannot win such a war and that is because of them.

            Agreed.
The thought that if the Chinese got a few coins in their pocket they would magically turn into a liberal democracy was preposterous. I continue to make the point that China is the way it is because it is filled with Chinese people. This delusional belief that just because there are KFC and Coca-Cola in China they will eventually live like shorter Americans is a farce.

            As Zman pointed out, the same set of geniuses, at the same time, thought that liberal democracy would organically flower in Iraq the moment they knocked down Saddam’s statue. They really did.
One wonders if they are still clinging to this or have jaded a bit about the inevitability of “democracy.” It doesn’t seem clear.

                Why assume the worst outcome is carved in stone?
Not caused in stone.  Just that history follows patterns because certain aspect of human nature have not changed in ten thousand years.
One of those is that power corrupts.Anytime that a state has achieved hegemonic power, as the GAE has now, the elites of that state become deranged, thinking that they are god on earth.  And engage in increasing bizarre and destructive acts that ultimate bring ruin on everyone.

                    Dinodoxy: “power corrupts… the elites… become deranged…”
I would strongly urge you to flip your thinking upside down [inside out] and consider a more inductivistic [rather than pseudo-deductivistic] explanation: Power ATTRACTS, and the more power, the more deranged the attracted personalities become.
Within the Passive Aggressive Industrial Complex [the “bureaucracies”, or “the Deep State”], only the most brutally sadistically psychopathic personalities can yank &amp; elbow &amp; punch &amp; kick &amp; bite &amp; back-stab &amp; poison their way up the ladder to the very pinnacle of Power.
tl;dr == Elitist nihilism is a self-selecting statistic.

        The Huntington/Fukuyama thing reminds me of the wisdom of the great Italian-American philosopher Lawrence Berra who said: “predictions are difficult, especially about the future”. (In fairness to Fukuyama, he is a damn good political historian who should have just stayed in his lane. His “Origins of Political Order” is very good.)There are a lot of excellent points and predictions downthread here about possible ethnic/group conflicts in future America. We have to be careful about predictions though. We have assembled an ethnic goulash here that is going to interact and clash in unpredictable ways.We all have a lot of theories about how the Indians could ultimately clash with Jews. That’s very interesting, but it’s quite possible an upcoming political battle between Hispanics and Blacks could be more important in shaping domestic politics. Hispanics outnumber Blacks now and relations are fraught at best.East Asians haven’t gotten very political yet. They have a lot of economic power. How will they use it politically? Are they going to support a protracted conflict with China?We could spend weeks laying out and handicapping all of what I call “conflict combinatorics” and not exhaust the possibilities. Perhaps the only sure bet is more conflict.

            Remember, according to official statistics, 25 million people were born in China in 1987. In 2022, there were only 9 million births.
My guess is that diaspora East Asians simply disappear over time. The birth rate collapse in China, Japan, S. Korea means few emigrants. Some diaspora returns to make money among a shrinking Asian labour force.
The rest mixes into the general US population. Something like 30% of East Asian women marry a man of another ethnicity. Without new immigrants from Asia they would disappear in a couple generations.

                The problem is that you assume in China’s case that all Chinese somehow contribute to the growing capitalistic/technological society they are creating.  They do not.  Most of the Chinese still scrape the ground in basically subsistence farming.  That China shrinks in population will prove much less disastrous than say in the USA where the White population is declining dramatically—even though the population is growing due to turd-world immigration.

            Hispanics have less of the economic wherewithal, and perhaps less of the inclination too, to flee from blacks every time they get near, as whites have done. And in those few but growing cases where they are without white power structures to restrain them, I’m thinking specifically of the Miami/Dade police and the Los Angeles County sheriff’s office, they are demonstrably less tolerant of black savagery than present day whites are. Which isn’t really saying much.

They really don’t care about the raving of and old mans lost world even though they are all “conservative” people in their teens and twenties.

            Those are good points. However, Indians are very well suited for the late stage era we lived through with massive bubbles in the software and financial industries. That played to their strong suit which is a high preference for credentialism, technically oriented credentials and skills and rising in industries that rose due to expropriation, national asset selloff, artificial interest rate based capital flows and debt financing.If that is coming to an end then the hard part begins. The population that has an edge in a tougher environment is one that has a segment that has grit and work ethic doing manual labor, martial prowess, and technological capability. Our people have all of that. One of the things that harmed our dirts is that being hotel chain operators was not so interesting to them. They wanted to do real work that made sense and had economic value. Many of our people are broken, but can be reforged. We are going to need all of them.I don’t think a center is going to hold, and thus a purely cosmopolitan cloud class that has no grit underneath it may lack an ingredient for dominance. The nature of the financial system is going to be a part of the selection process.I don’t know why, but I can’t shake that image of JD Vance in his Ferragamos poking a stream with a stick. Our people have a long way to go to live up to our past. For now, the bar on political leadership is very low.

                Good point on Indians capitalizing on late-stage civilization.
Use Silicon Valley as an example.  Indians were not nor were they ever capable of creating such technology or building those companies.  But once established, they can force their way into management, rise up with “credentials”, and gain power in an already successful company.
In short, they are not builders, but pretty good at skimming.

                    Yes. That isn’t to say that a few among them are not elite performers and capable of innovation. There are. But on the whole the Nero plan for India with the software and the US was the same as petroleum engineers and the Middle East. It was heads down capable grinders in an environment and structure provided by someone else. I look at Pinchai, Pagarwal (the twitter dude), Nadella and the others and I look at my experience with others and they look like people with advanced degrees and some like Chalmath P (the Indian version of Mark Cuban type IPO grifter) who can ape Managerial Speak and play the game of valuation inflation through IPO or PE exit.But what comes next is a different selective environment. It is going to require bravery and balls. It is going to favor Lions over foxes. I like that. It slumbers in our people, but it is still there.It is just rare. To this day, Jeff Dean is The Guy at Google – and he is that guy for a very good reason.

            Indians have only taken over the UK if you think that politicians run the UK.
May as well say Turks  run the UK because of “Boris Johnson”.
Politicians do not run the UK-just like the US.

        Samuel Huntington made an impact with the “Clash of Civilizations,” but his book that followed a few years later, “Who Are We,” isn’t talked about as much.  It’s still an important book (from the early 2000s) about immigration and multiculturalism and might make for a good topic on a future Power Hour.

                Thanks for that. WHO ARE WE? really was the first mainstream dissident book from a widely admired scholar, so of course he had to be destroyed, as Francis noted.

                The antagonistic interview of Huntington by Deborah Solomon of the New York Times magazine that Francis features illustrates the thinking of the urban elite.  I’m going to go with deductive reasoning and say Solomon lives in Manhatten and is a tribemember.

        Great podcast today. Now let’s back up a step and give it context.Life on Earth – about a billion years. Homo spapiens – a few hundred thousand years (0.02%). Civilization – about 6,000 years. Dominance of man-made environments vs the natural world – maybe a millennia.For most of life’s history, the natural world was dominant, evolution was guided by local environmental factors, and each niche produced subspecies that thrived in its place of origin. That is why Africans, Chinese, and Scandinavians are so different. Each is optimized based upon its unique history and location.The modern man-made world has changed this dynamic. People move easily around the planet now and outlanders have tended to conquer and exploit non-native lands everywhere. And this has created the novel problem of “misfit” where migratory peoples are now domiciled in places where they no longer can thrive because their evolutionary heritage is not a match with the new environment. This happens in the biological space (genetics) and the behavioral space (culture differences). Hence perpetual conflict in these misfit zones.The Cloud People want to remedy this problem by turning everyone into homogenized insect-like humanoids. Do you want to become an insect-like humanoid? If not, then you must be willing to do more than just complain.

                    Yes, but when we get all the news stories about a “ rise in anti-semitic violence “ the “ violent” are 95% from the “ diverse” and “ vibrant “ “ community ”.

        Samuel Huntingdon did in fact address the second prong of what forms national identity in his last book, WHO ARE WE? Although solidly a man of the New Deal Left, Huntingdon was unpersoned after that book was published. His central thesis simply pointed out the obvious: American culture directly reflected its British Protestant roots, and had absorbed with great difficulty the prior immigration waves only because they were Western and White.Where Huntingdon went somewhat awry was his primary focus on Hispanics migrants as the primary threat to American civilization. While he was correct their culture is incompatible with traditional America, they largely have segregated and in a few rare case somewhat assimilated. Hispanics are a problem and should not be here, obviously, but the East and South Asians over the long haul will prove the death blow. The United States Huntingdon loved did die with the Hispanic invasion, but the American people he held dear are under existential threat mostly from Indians, Pakis, and the Chinese. The group that opened the door to them, and who engineered Huntingdon’s destruction near the end of his life, no longer is the primary threat and also is diminishing in power. Huntingdon should have been more muscular about their malign influence.I actually think Huntingdon used CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS as the foundation for and introduction of WHO ARE WE? While the latter destroyed him, largely at the hands of evil Tribesmen who held open the door for the invasion, it has proved to be even more prophetic. Not only is the GAE dying, the United States has died. Huntingdon warned of this. He saw what was being done, and the restraint of CLASH diminished with WHO ARE WE?To fold in a couple of the points you made, it is quite ironic albeit predictable that the Judeo-Puritan religious fanatics who have adopted Francis Fukuyama’s THE END OF HISTORY AND THE LAST MAN as their credo also were among the few Americans who earlier embraced Marxism. It is far too late to save the United States, but it could have been salvaged if these types had been checked and eliminated from the body politic somewhere around the Eighties.What we call “Globohomo” is viewed primarily as an economic force, and it certainly is that, but the Judeo-Puritan fanatics also use END as their textbook for cultural imperialism, as you point out. Domestically, the Forever War against Appalachia and the South actually has ramped up in recent years to try to hammer those regions into conformity just as is the points of the proxy war against Russia along with the hot wars against Muslims and the cold war against China. The Judeo-Puritans will lose, and on both fronts, but the damage will be incalculable and that assumes they don’t burn the world down with them.Huntingdon ultimately was a race realist, and Fukuyama an adopted Judeo-Puritan. We all know who has the better argument. The Judeo-Puritans had many great traits, but rationality on this and many other issues was not one of them and ultimately took us to the bottom.

They are not such an existential threat as are the other non-White minorities coming in or already here—like Blacks.We have much culturally in common with Hispanics.  Here in my burg, we have a majority Hispanic police and Border Patrol.  Unlike the recent incident in Memphis, they are not violent, low IQ, AA thugs.  Rather the opposite when given a badge and authority.  This is cultural in basis.

                When you are surrounded by Chinese, Indians, Arabs, Africans, and Libtards, it’s almost like meeting a brother when you come across a Latino, no matter how dark. Suddenly it’s nice to hear Spanish in public and see a cross every so often, compared to the alternatives.
It sounds like cringe civ-nat stuff. But, as Z said today, identity is relative.
Ideally there would be no immigration at all. But long-term, compared to Europe, Canada, and AUS, I see the USA actually having the best immigrant mix through mass Latino immigration. The nicest tasting shit sandwich, I guess.

                    Something that goes unremarked is suddenly there is a huge contingent of Africans and South Asians among the Hispanics streaming across the wide-open southern border of the USA. They didn’t get there by simply walking up Mexico, which means NGO’s, a/k/a the “Deep State,” is making that happen. There is concern, apparently, that the Mestizos aren’t anti-White enough. We are witnessing a catastrophe unfold and the monsters behind it are acting ad hoc for the most part.

                        Bingo.  At the Southern border are now thousands of sub-Saharan Blacks.  How did they get here from there?  The BP classification of illegal crossers as OTM (other than Mexican) is growing exponentially.  How does that happen?

My bet is it is to salve black politicians. They are whining about being replaced, which also is happening, and people like Eric Adams need something to assuage their low IQ, feral constituents. Haitians and Subs mixing into the group is to make Shaneeka calm down. Take note that the NGO’s/United States are not doing the same with displaced Ukrainians. Not the right color, and native Whites are too cowed to complain about their replacement.

                Here in the Bay Area the Hispanics have more than their share of bad hombres. They’re responsible for much of the epidemic of catalytic converter theft. They’re also over-represented in drunk driving incidents. True, they’re not as involved in violent street crime nor do they chimp out in fast food restaurants or on school buses.

        As Z likes to say, he lives in Baltimore because he likes to see what the future looks like. Well, I live in Northern Virginia, so I get my own glimpse into the future, and it’s a lot more Indian.Sure, there are plenty of Hispanics and a good sprinkling of Africans and Muslims, but for upper middle-class white people, it’s the Indians that you’ll notice the most because the Indians are coming hard and fast.(Btw, the white working and middle class are gone. They retreated to the hinterlands of rural Virginia and West Virginia. For them, Hispanics are what they’ll be dealing with, though even in these places, a few Indians will pop up.)Asians are around as well, but they tend to just grind away and stay low. The Indians are rapidly showing up as business owners, lawyers, real estate agents and, most importantly, politicians. Sound familiar. Naturally, Indians work together loosely.Of course, Indians are all-in on the anti-white agenda, but it’s clear that they don’t really care. It’s just a way to grab power.What differentiates Indians from the tribe is that it’s hard to tell what Indians want. The tribe wants power and money, sure, but they also want to change society. The Indians just seem to want money and power.That said, Indians do have a grudge against whites so they’re similar in that respect, but other than that, they don’t seem too interested in transforming the world. Again, the Woke stuff seems to be a tool for them. They’d go full populist is they thought that it’d get them where they want to go.It’s always the elites or near elites that lead the charge on civil wars, and in America’s case, that will be whites, Jews and Indians in the near future. (Asians just don’t seem too interested in playing the power game, and Hispanics aren’t smart enough or interested enough.) And if whites pussy out, it’ll be Jews vs Indians to see who runs Brazil of the North.Pound for pound, Jews are better, but there’s more Indians and they’re much more hungry. Should be a good fight.

            Jews vs Indians…interesting thought.
Peter Frost has a relatively recent study on the oft touted Ashkenazi Jews and their vaunted IQ:
https://peterfrost.substack.com/p/ashkenazi-jews-and-recent-cognitive
Worth a read.  Teaser—their once vaunted IQ may be no more.
Similarly, one wonders if the same will not eventually happen to American Indians—who for the most part come from the upper castes of their homeland.

                There’s definitely been a fall-off in young Jews. I hear about it from friends in law and banking. The older partners are heavily Jewish, but the upcoming associates are a mix of whites, Indians, Asians and some Jews.Jews continue to have tremendous power due to their control of the media, banking and politics, but you can see the foundation showing cracks. That said, they’ll still have a lot of power for a very long time.But other groups are playing the same game. Indians are very aware of Jews and use them as a role model. Part of what made Jews so successful is that they had no real competition. Whites just didn’t play the identity game. Indians do. So do American Asians, but they’re not very good at it.As to Indians following the decline of Jews. Maybe, but it’ll take another 50 years.

                    The one big difference is that 1/5 of humanity is or will be Hindu, while a tiny fraction are Jew. Jews can’t afford to slip up, but the Hindu can slip a thousand times and there will be another one to replace him/her.

                        Maybe. But I have noticed something very interesting with the interaction of Indians and whites.
Whites (even prissy liberal whites) don’t like being lectured to by Indians (or Asians for that matter). You see whites physically bristle when an Indian starts telling them about how terrible they are.
Liberal whites are willing to get lectured to by their magical blacks or their (((fellow whites))), but they don’t like it when it comes from some fat Indian lady.

                Yes, but when we get all the news stories about a “ rise in anti-semitic violence “ the “ violent” are 95% from the “ diverse” and “ vibrant “ “ community ”. One would think the Finkels ( supposedly so smart ) might get the point that their best safety lies in white evangelical  gentiles with their cult of “ America’s Greatest Ally”.

            I think this is a solid and sober analysis of the ethnic factions and who the combatants will be.Whites will find their appetite for conflict and lose their propensity to grovel in moral cowardice and conflict avoidance. There are too many of us who, once the reality of being a permanent second and underclass becomes reality, will not sit idly by. I suspect that whites and east asians will ally with each other. I have been told explicitly by several Asians in the tech world that they much prefer working with white men. One thing I have noticed about South Asians as a general rule, is that on the surface is a friendly veneer, but underneath is an extremely chauvinistic, misogynistic animal that can be ruthless. In positions of authority they are weak but dangerous because they have no qualms about going on the war path against any dissenting voice. I’ve seen this in my professional life. It reaches levels of not being rational. They have a disdain for any dissenting voice – I have noticed a propensity to misinterpret open honest dialogue aimed at furthering the mission to success as opposition and disloyalty. Perhaps my sample size is too small, but I have observed it – here and in their homeland.One missing piece is that the prime contenders are going to have to deal with the black supremacists. That faction is extremely well organized and is erecting themselves as the social credit system gatekeepers. Their weakness is that they only offer themselves as an anti-white sledge hammer using grievance and cultural decimation. Once their utility in that regard and in their violent crime being a pretext for gun control, is used up, they serve no purpose. Still, they will be in many positions of authority and have a population that they have been very good at turning into a violent mob to get their way. That will have to be dealt with.It is hard to say if the primary contenders, Whites, (if they find their spines, stomachs and balls), East Asians, South Asians, Jews will need to deal with the Black Supremacists first or some coalition of the former will use them as a springboard, and deal with them as rivals later. I think whoever takes the latter strategy will need to be prepared to deal with a physically capable and violent group that has large numbers and that may control significant swaths of the military if things keep proceeding as they are now.In any case, things are setting up in a way that very few have the first clue about. While the intensity of the racial issue has been ratcheted up to insane levels, I think it is nothing compared to what it will be. If whites start to stand up for themselves, things will get extremely intense very quickly. The Obama/Biden judicial appointments will guarantee that as the courts may not provide whites with much recourse in combatting open anti-white discrimination in professional life and violent crime near home.What is important is that our group be prepared along every dimension as elite performance across every single one will be required to come out on top. The ingredients are out there along every dimension, but it needs to be coordinated.

All sample sizes of *one* are too small, but there are a whole lot of people here commenting here, with a whole lot of experience, and a whole lot of brain power who agree with you.
That’s not to be ignored.

                One interesting thing to look at, that may or may not have relevance, is how the races in American prisons choose their enemies and allies.
White gangs and American Hispanic gangs often team up together. You have white gangs teaming up with Hispanic gangs against the black prison gangs.
I could definitely see something like that happening outside of prisons. Blue collar and populist whites teaming up with working class Hispanics against the PMC whites, lefties and their black enforcers.

                        I have plenty of second hand experiences with people who ave been to prison but as far as some kind of “evidence” available about all I can think of for you to do would be to look up various prison gangs on the internet and see who their allies are.
For example the Wikipedia article of the Mexican Mafia lists the Aryan Brotherhood as an allie. The article on the Nazi Lowriders lists the Sureños as an allie.

                        There was an ex-prisoner making YouTube video’s who explained the gang dynamics as he experienced it in CA prisons.  Yep, Hispanics joined Whites in many instances.  I believe a Hispanic gang even save his ass in a fight due to this cooperation.

            I disagree that the Hindu elites don’t have a goal. I think their ultimate goal is simply to make white people respect/notice them. They want to lord over white people (justified as payback for colonialism, although it’s more so an expression of an extreme inferiority complex). They want to grind your head in the dirt and have you beg them for mercy. They want white women to give them attention.Overall – good observations. Same thing in Toronto. Growing up, the joke was always that China was going to take over, since there were so many Chinese people. What ended up happening over time was Indians flooding in. I see fewer and fewer Chinese nowadays outside of Chinese enclaves, and the ones I do see are often 50 or older.The huge flood of Indians is fairly recent, and seemed to increase a lot after 2016. 2016 was when the elites said “F- it” and just flooded &amp; destroyed all our countries.The ones coming to Canada are less skilled, more likely to be Punjabi (mostly blue collar workers) or Tamils (were into gangs at one point but that’s kind of subsided). A lot of them come in as “international students”, pay high fees for basically a fake degree, then get on a path to citizenship. Once they “graduate” they work as dump truck drivers, buy Dodge Challengers and Jeeps on credit, and shoot off fireworks. They are similar to Mexicans but with a larger petit bourgeoisie fraction of independent business owners.They don’t have the same bitterness, femininity, and inferiority complex as the Hindu strivers going to the US have. But they are still going to start taking over in many places, simply due to numbers.I also disagree that there is even a “white” faction among the elites. The “white” faction of the elites is probably the military, which has been thoroughly purged. Unless they are playing some 5-D chess, the military elites are firmly in line with Globohomo.

                Yes, Indians really want to stick it to whites. But outside of that, they don’t have some grand plan in the way that the small hats do. Indians don’t care about transforming society outside of hammering whites. They just want to get rich and have the untouchables do their bidding.

                Yes, Jews lose a lot of their power when faced with non-white opponents. Indians, Chinese, whoever, can’t be made to feel guilt by the tribe. What’s more, the tribe can play the “my fellow” Indians trick on other races.
That leaves financial levers, which is why these groups – both in the states and in their own countries – want their own financial system. They know what the tribe is doing.

            There are no Indians in my business but there are enough around town to give a consistent impression. People compare them to Jews but, in everyday life, the Jews they’re like are the Brooklyn Hasidim, reeking chiselers who make a point of physically getting in your way to mock your civility. The Jews at least read books. Indians have no human qualities.

        This was an excellent show.  What comes next, what will American civilization be in the coming decades is the primary question.
You had a column titled “Hindu Lebensraum.”  Given the demographics of India, they are very young, very fertile and eager to emigrate, I wonder what the impact will be on America and Canada.   Hindus are highly tribal, like the Jews except there are a billion of them.   They also have a chip on their shoulders vs the West and white people.  I’d like to see you ex[lore that in future columns.
The next few decades will be interesting.

            It is incorrect to talk of Hindus as *one* people.  David Reich in his book, “Who We Are and How We Got Here” has a chapter or two analyzing the Indian peoples.  He maintains that genetically India is a country of many peoples—at least 5 major divisions—which correspond closely to their caste system and their caste system to skin color (who’d have thunk, huh?).This explains why Lynn could describe/measure the national IQ as around 83, while we have so many examples of successful Indian migrants in the West.  Indian migration may yet be a threat, but there are not a billion+ just waiting to arrive and replace the indigenous population.  Couple that with the increasing industrialization and technological growth of present day India (having shrugged off socialism) creating opportunities for their best and brightest.

            Canada plans to increase its population from 38Mln today to 100Mln by 2100. I suspect it is going to be all from India and China.Petraeus openly talked about what is today Canada the US and Mexico/Central America being a single nation – well trade zone.I think their plan is to cram as many people into North America as possible and emulate China. Problem. China is largely a single ethnos or at least a dominant ethnos. At the same time that the GAE is doing this, it is systematically attacking its dominant ethnos and its own culture.I don’t know if they have a plan for this, or this is what happens when you turn Universities from places of deep and careful learning for the purposes of having the best ruling elite possible into job training factories at best and anti-civilizational mold breeders at best.Putin and Xi are serious men who are likely surrounded by serious men. Meantime we have Biden, HRC, Christine Lagarde and company grooming the likes of Greta Thunberg to be our future leaders.More Clown Horn as our host once said!! (Isn’t that song’s topic the grim reaper? How appropriate)

That’s a problem, but not *the* problem.  The problem is our over-riding ideology of equality among the races and lack of racial awareness.  This disease affects the majority of Whites—Left, Right, or Center of the political spectrum.  Nothing will change when the Leftists you cite above leave power.

            I was pleasantly surprised by the choice of music.  I guess that Z Man was a metal head back in the day, as was I, and there was a wall between metal fans and the post-punk of Echo and the Bunnymen.  I was only one I knew at the time who appreciated both worlds.The album that has the song Z played is the one where their singer let his inner Jim Morrison out, which was odd because the descendants of punk tended to ignore any bands earlier than the Ramones.  And Echo, like the Doors but even moreso, incorporated Middle Eastern melodies into their songs.

        I realize this sounds wildly optimistic, but if the fever of the 20th century is the reason for diversity, and the future is a clash of civilizations, I wonder what will keep the recent arrivals here.Depends on the motivations, I guess. Are these conquerers or economic migrants? Same for America: are we a new nation, or a pirate operation?Seems to me it’s both, on both counts, but we’ll find out about the numbers. I’d guess the colonists/conquerers are in the minority, which could mean an emptying of North America. I don’t see any nation in a state to expand globally, except maybe China— maybe— but the Chinese historically like to stay close to home.

                Maybe I’m crazy, but Europeans liked the land when they got here, right? It wasn’t that much different from home, not an unnatural fit. I’m not sure I’ve ever heard that from the recent arrivals, and I wonder if that would be a factor. As far as Hispanics, they do fit, but I wonder how that would play out if things get tribal again. We have the example of history, although it wouldn’t necessarily repeat. As far as Indians, I have no idea. They’re around but not aggressive so far, and the guys at work complain that it’s hard to get the food they’re used to and the herbs that don’t grow around here.Of course, I’m assuming globalism takes a couple of steps back. I’m not sure the trends continue without it. Cosmopolitans are always the minority, and I’m not sure the numbers would want to stay where they can’t make themselves at home.

            You’re wildly wrong. The Indians, Asians, Hispanics, Africans are no more going back than your ancestors went back. These people are here to stay.
There’s no going back. We carve out a spot for ourselves in some form or another or we get run over. That’s nature.

                They won’t go back, or rather leave for greener pastures, because there will be no greener pastures.  China will never admit them, as per their racial policy.  Japan similarly.  And so forth. No other major player in the world economic game outside the West is so dumb as to sacrifice racial purity for simple—and temporary—economic advantage.

            Quite a state of affairs when optimism gets rebuked. I realize the world’s been ending since the late 80s for some, but that’s not the case for all.

                Bible says the world already is ‘passing away’.  And that quote is two thousand years old already.
By Heavenly Clock — one millennium equals one day — this planet has a bit more one day of existence remaining.  After that point comes a ‘new heaven and a new Earth’ and those who once lived on Earth will no longer have a memory either of their prior lives, or of Earth itself.
That is a very great blessing and gift because some things are best not remembered, nor carried cognitively through eternity.

        Z, PART 1: “The new diverse societies being created will have to be organized around something.”The Sanhedrin of the Frankfurt School fully intend for ‘the new diverse societies’ to be organized around a continuing &amp; intensifying &amp; all-consuming mesmerization &amp; hypnotization enforced via monopoly control of fake money, lawfare, edumakashunal indoctrination, ta1mudivision, scr0tial media, pr0n, paedophilia and pharmaceutical poisoning [SSRIs, Benzodiazipines, MRNA v@xxines, etc].Jerome Powell is certainly doing everything he can to fight the fake money.And maybe someone like Neil Gorsuch will step forward and fight the good fight against lawfare?But as of right now, the home team ain’t ready to run through the tunnel and out onto the playing field.[Although Orange Man Bad had some outstanding optics in East Palestine. Y’all may hate the guy, but OMB knows his optics.]===============Z, PART 2: “The civilizational idea allows for the native population to impose their will on the guest populations.”That remains to be seen.As of yet, the Saxon has not quite begun to hate.===============Kinda off-topic, but this Tik-Tok phenomenon, where the millennial hoz are suddenly having the intensely real but sleeping dreams of children whom they never birthed, in combination with what ever it is that is happening in Asbury, is simply bizarre.As though they were a third hand at play here.An invisible hand.[I hope it’s not just another psy-op.

                The Orthodox also serve that role. I like this quote from St. Anthony the Great:
“A time is coming when men will go mad, and when they see someone who is not mad, they will attack him, saying, “You are mad; you are not like us.”

                    First in the tank, first out. Orthodoxy survived the Bolsheviks, Catholicism is coming to grips with Catholic-Jewish dialogue. My hope, and suspicion, is that Protestants now deal with Judeo-Christianity.
Of course, my hope is Christianity finally becomes a gentile religion, but at any rate.
