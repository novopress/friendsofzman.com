        I think you are underestimating what a scumbag Joe Biden is.  His own daughter wrote in her diary that her father forced her to take “inappropriate showers” with him.  That, along with the way he acted around little girls (sniffing their hair and the creepy touching), makes me think the guy is a pedo.

            Hunter had Joe’s name in his phone as “Pedo Peter.” There is little doubt about it.

                So getting back to evil, what does that say about the people who work for or defend the guy?  Everybody knows at this point.  These types only ever rise to power when society itself has become so debased.  How many major corporations break the rules every day, some good person whistle blows, and then has their life ruined?  The system itself has transformed into this, not saying it was ever perfect, but at this point its pure evil.

                    Longtime establishment stooge Megan McArdle posted on X about the obvious hiring discrimination against whites that has taken place and why it happened.  Halfway through the thread she says she talked to a law partner about why this happened and the explanation was that they figured it was impossible to get sued. She goes on to add suing in many fields like academia or non profits would have been career suicide.  They have become so insular no one will dare to use the law to oppose them.

                        I always felt like America First Legal was one of the most effective organizations we have, and of course it was started by based Stephen Miller. It only takes a few lawsuits to put the fear of God into EVERYONE, and that’s exactly what they have been doing. The clear written law of the United States says that the behavior of about 98% of corporations and 100% of nonprofits/universities is illegal and so there is fertile ground for lawsuits.

                        Right, so 80% of the people in the United States will do evil if it protects their income stream.  Think we learned that in 2020 and 2021.  At least in the past the lust for money was balanced by religion.  Then we killed religion and replaced it with pop culture.  The internet just injected steroids into that bullshit and look where we are now.

                            For some people it was lust for money. For others it was preservation of their livelihood. There’s a big difference between the two.

                                People who mock those who took the jab to keep their jobs, are on passive income – most likely welfare, what with the attitude.They are blaming the victim: who was Uncle Norm going to believe? The Orange Man, the lab coats, the WHO, the DHS, the media, the politicians, the famous actors, all the TikTok-nurses and Taylor honest-to-god Swift?Or a bunch of disgraced doctors, grifters, shills, bots, porn stars, flatearthers and six million cartoon frogs who never heard the word “coronavirus” until 2020?Uncle Norm has a lot on his plate, he doesn’t have time to chase down and factcheck every conspiracy theory on the internet.In Denmark, it was get jabbed or spend two hours every four (4!) days queueing for ritual facerape with the Covid-stick. And no travelling abroad, of course, making jabbing effectively mandatory for a lot of working people in a small place like Denmark.We hates them, Precious!

                                    Ultimately if you went along with it YOU went along with it.
Anyone pleading that theyre just an NPC and cant be judged by the standards of a free human being with a mind, sure okay.
Ultimately leaders are important but those that huddled with the herd need to either 1) stop doing that or 2) find a better herd to huddle with or 3) at least realize what they are and not posture as more.

                                            People that go along to get along made it much harder for everyone standing on principle. In fact all the evil that was perpetrated was possible because so many people would do anything they were told to avoid any embarrassment or inconvenience.
I guess maybe the rest of us paid a price at the time, but those that gave in back then have who knows what coursing through their veins now.  So theyre paying a price for lack of principle too.  Always a price for doing wrong even if its not obvious at the time

They were told to take the jab to avoid triggering a civilization-destroying plague, not to mention dying horribly themselves. And they weren’t told this by some anonymous internet cranks, but by everyone who mattered.Why should they not believe it? Most people aren’t experts on cellular biology and, as I said, didn’t have time to scour the internet for the few dissenting voices who weren’t flatearthers, chemtrailers and moonhoaxers who told them not to vax because there were mobile phones in the syringe.

I mean I’m glad if youve eventually come around but maybe you need to reevaluate your worldview.Do you also believe Putin attacked Ukraine in an unprovoked way because he’s new hitler?  Do you also believe in trans kids?  Do you think blacks commit crime because of socioeconomic factors and the legacy of segregation?I mean how far are you currently still following all these luminaries “who matter”?

                                    Felix, my observation of extended family and friends does not support your hypothesis. Granted, here in AINO we didn’t have to line up to get tested every few days. Just speaking for myself, I’d have dared them to throw me in jail for refusing.
I’ve found it difficult to narrow it down much more than the 80/20 rule. But who makes up the 80, and who makes up the 20, and more importantly why, seems impossible to identify.

                                        But you’re not supposed to educate yourself in virology every time you go to the doctor, just like you’re not supposed to personally check a plane’s air worthiness before you buy a ticket.
That’s what we pay government to do for us, and that’s what the 80% quite reasonably expect is happening.

                                            @Felix, that’s just it. You are supposed to do those things. You may and probably should seek out the advice of someone you think has superior knowledge, but at the end of the day, the decision to comply is yours.
WRT COVID, what the experts were demanding you do is forget everything we’ve ever known about virology, plus ignore more or less irrefutable empirical evidence, i.e., Diamond Princess. That should have been viewed as the unreasonable demand it was.

And
The experts were demanding you forget everything we’ve ever known about virology
You see the problem? All the experts were telling us to vax up or granny dies.
And normal people know sweet fa about virology – and that includes 95% of those who suddenly became experts in the spring of 2020, yet still can’t tell you what “mRNA” stands for.

                                            It is a matter of paying attention, a “republic if you can keep it” style of thinking. When i was about to turn 18, 9/11 happened. I reacted like all Americans did, then Iraq (WtF did they have to do with anything?), then torture, then one god damned never ending occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan. Mind you, we haven’t even reached 2008 yet. Then that happened, the little is thrown under the bus, trillions are printed to keep the rich whole. No one goes to jail but some schmuck, that JP Morgan knew was running a ponzi. Then Obamacare, then culture wars turned up to 11, then white hats in syria, and on and on and on. If you don’t remember these things, and how each and everyone of them is a lie, yeah you’ll believe what they tell you. That is why i’m part of the 20% that didn’t get it and also i don’t live off passive income. I was threatened multiple times with being fired, i ignored them, they tried to convince you in meetings, i shot back my own reasons for reservations. At one point my manager said to me “your smart” during one of these talks, but more in the why won’t you just do what we say way. I was willing to lose my job, it was the hill where i was going to make my stand after being lied to and shoved around for decades. So character, values, all kinds of things played a part, but the biggest in my opinion is knowing they lie about everything and anything.  Not to mention living Covid was like watching a bad hollywood movie.  The Diamond princess told us all we need to know at the very beginning, everyone on the boat didn’t die.

So your convictions weren’t really put to the test.I was lucky my boss was smart enough not to ask me about my vax status (I suspect the wily old fox cheated on the jab himself) but if you have a family and your livelihood is on the line, it’s a matter of conflicting moral obligations, and it’s not entirely clear to me that opting for the autocamper lifestyle is the correct choice.

We were talking about the 80% who do NOT have four hours a day to surf the internet for evert dissident notion (because they have a job) and who are NOT aware that “all they do is lie”.
You have zero empathy for normal people – the victims of the hoax – and to top it, you have that hateful, gloating attitude I talked about earlier.

I began my journey off the reservation before you were in primary school, so the gayop was glaringly obvious.
But this discussion, to repeat, is not about me or about you, it’s about the people who never stood a chance because ALL THE EXPERTS told them to jab.

                                                The important thing about the Diamond Princess (and the USS Theodore Roosevelt one month later) was that they were experiments of nature, in two widely varying age/fitness groups, of the outer limits of risk associated with proximity and behavior, THAT SHOULD HAVE formed the basis for all subsequent public policy. That the very robust data sets arising from both incidents, complete by late March 2020, were not adopted by public health authorities as the template for policy development, was a big problem.

                        This reminds me of a cyber security person saying that if you work remote the companies feel perfectly fine with spying on people at will and during non-work hours through their work computers and work phones. There must have been a lot of abuse of that during peak woke and there probably still is.

            I remember a story that went around about how he would swim in his pool naked in front of female secret service. I’m inclined to believe it because it fits with the rest of his persona. It didn’t get any traction. But then Tara Reade didn’t really either. If you asked your average baizuo about her, they’d say “Who? The actress?” Or accuse her of being a Russian plant, since that was the only place she could go to escape the retribution. (I am also inclined to believe Ms. Reade, because of her mom on CSPAN back in the day).

                    This privilege of suing for made up accusations goes right to the heart of what Ray has been saying. I just saw a clip by a woman, sued by another woman scorned (by her, she’s hetero), for millions of dollars.She was explaining that’s why men give up- it’s easier to just give our over-entitled, over-empowered women what they demand rather than ruin your life. They make stuff up, accuse you of it, and will go to the ends of the earth pursuing the accused in court and online rather than than ever admit to fault or to bearing false witness.The system incentivizes this exact thing, especially in women.The system also puts these harpies in power, as much as it can.But, as the Zman points out, they and the legal system that enables them doesn’t think they’re the bad guys. This is why the Left, and nonwhites, and women, understand power at a gut level.

They make stuff up, accuse you of it, and will go to the ends of the earth pursuing the accused in court and online rather than ever admit to fault or to bearing false witness’They will and they do, by the tens-of-millions.And you are absolutely correct, Alzaebo, about why men have refused to fight the feminist evil the past century and just give females whatever they demand: men know that vindictive females, their ‘justice’ system, and their government will destroy men’s lives, criminalize them, impoverish them, and then look for the next sucker to fleece. Yea, it is the Fleecing of the Sheep by the wolves.Men and boys are walking away now, disengaging from a sistem that loathes and uses them, and I encourage doods to do it. It is the only effective expression of dissent they are allowed, and even this now is being scapegoated by the Regime as ‘dangerous incels’ who daily plot mass murder.

                This early incident explains 2020 Jill Biden. She was “monkey branching” at an early age. The pinnacle of success for her was the Presidency. That her husband was incapable of executing the office of no concern to her. That he could achieve it was everything. Again, is this an example of “banality”? Hard to believe so.

And correct, she managed to monkeybranch her way to the White House, where (trust me on this) she was the real person in-charge.

                        “(trust me on this) she was the real person in-charge.”Oh, I trust you on that.  I confess to such with my wife whom I depend upon for many decisions and sage advice.  It’s most often laziness in my part, however one becomes used to such delegation/dependency.  You don’t stay married for 50 years without developing such, and I can see if I were declining in cognitive ability it would happen pretty automatically.Indeed, I even had my doctor(s) of late telling me to feel free to bring her along on examinations/consultation.  It is just another of the “indignities” of old age we suffer through.  You accept such or die.

That’s how it was designed to be. “Help-meet” does not mean “subordinate”. It never did. It means something more like “suitable” or “match”. The higher the quality of the man, the higher the necessary quality of the woman to be his match.

It never did’Bible: ‘But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man. . . .’ (1 Corinthians 11:3)The head of the woman is THE MAN. Period. Not ‘partner’. Not ‘equal’. And damn sure not ‘superior’, which is what nearly every wife was to husband when I lived in America and observed around me.The passage DOES mean SUBORDINATE, unless you’re gonna argue ‘the head of’ means blah blah opposite.Your (sad, really) attempt at cucking Scripture is the way of the modern world. The Broad Way. What you advocate is not God’s will nor Christianity, but the secular/feminist lies of the age.

                                    Corithians? Yes. If you take the word of a Pharisee who claimed to have “seen the light”, yet has 3 very different versions of his “road to Damascus” moment?
I do not automatically reject anything said by a jew, unlike many commenters here. I just compare what Paul says to what Jesus says, and often find him lacking.
Incidentally, your take, the one Paul expresses, is also that of the Pharisees, who He says are Satan’s offspring by word and deed. Doesn’t that give you pause?

No. William of Ockham does.

Unlike Christians like you who ignore Genesis 2? Project much?

                            ‘“(trust me on this) she was the real person in-charge.”Oh, I trust you on that. I confess to such with my wife’
You ‘confess’ that your wife is in-charge. Well, it’s a popular choice!
But ‘accept such or die’? You cannot be serious. I suffer under those ‘indignities’ too, I suspect far more serious than yourself. I push through it without a wife, much less one that is in charge of me.
Now if you are incapacitated mentally, then sure, your wife would be making the decisions. Are you incapacitated mentally?  :O)

                                I was referring to accepting the “indignities” that often follow in the declining years of life.  In the example, poorly worded I now perceive, was that my doctor would ask me to bring along my wife!Now what would that mean, except that he considers perhaps that I either do not understand as he would like, or will not comply as he would like—referring to medical consult.  That is an indignity.  (My last meeting was without wife and a written discussion of treatment protocols I desired was presented so there could be no mistake of requirements.  He dutifully agreed.)There are other indignities that I perceive as I age.  Not to make too much of such perceptions, but for example folks ask me if I need help with grocery carry out.  Open doors for me and the like.  However, I am not infirmed—not in the slightest.  Indeed, I can outperform physically most of them.  I just look old as is appropriate to my age.

                And wasn’t this elaborate sexual hi-jinx taking place when Joe’s sainted wife, Cornelia, hadn’t yet driven her car into a truck? Joe, in feigned outrage, then for years blamed the truck driver as having”drunk his lunch,” which was NOT true. Sort of the same deflection of blame that this week’s prostate cancer diagnosis does for last week’s replaying the audio of Special Counsel Hur’s interview of President Biden, showing undeniable cognitive lapses. One wonders . . .what comes next?

            It indeed is a mistake to underplay how malignant Biden was. He falsely accused the man his late wife plowed into, killing her and his kid, of being drunk, to cite a quick example. Biden perfectly reflected the Banana Empire’s vile nature.

                A lie he told frequently where the only benefit was a small amount of public sympathy in elections he was going to win easily.  Not only was the truck driver not drunk, Biden’s wife was at fault in the accident.  The truck driver’s daughter had to publicly shame the Biden campaign to stop using the story in order to get him to drop it.  I bet he needed frequent reminders in the 2020 campaign not to bring it up.

                    Just thought of another benefit to Joe that fatal car accident provided: it made him a widower, which allowed him to remarry without the problem a divorce would have caused his Roman Catholic identity. I don’t think Dr. Jill is Catholic, cuz she obviously got a divorce and I think the ex is still alive. Not sure she can take communion without the church noticing the breach of its rules.

                    At the time there was rumor that she killed herself and tried take the kids with her, using an innocent trucker as a weapon, because she found out that Joe had done something so terrible that familicide was the only response.
Not likely, but his lie put the story as far fromthatas possible, suspiciously.
But but, he always lies about everything.

            Yep, I think there is enough evidence/innuendo to assume Biden was pretty evil in and of himself.  The entire family knowingly committed evil/criminal acts of one type or another, pick your favorite.  There are many.  I can buy into Z-man’s analysis, but only to a point.  Eichmann perhaps was a better example in that I have never read of his “private” evil actions in private life.

        Say what you want about banana republics, but Latin Americans at least stage honest coups: men with guns, explosions, gaudy uniforms, a few corpses in the street, the new caudillo on the balcony etc. It has an integrity about it that I can respect; you know what you are looking at.It would never occur to them to fix an election AND get insanely self-righteous about gainsayers AND install a dementia-addled Mr Magoo as el presidente AND acclaim him as Pericles reborn while he slurs and phases in and out of consciousness. It’s a retarded burlesque, performed by malicious halfwits, apparently with the aim of inducing severe mental illness in the spectators.

            The great Garcia Marquez wrote a story (“Nobody Writes to the Colonel”) about a pedo LatAm dictator who would molest school girls. The parents complain to his Prime Minister, so he hires prostitutes to dress in school girl uniforms so the Colonel could molest them instead. Oddly enough, Jill Biden didn’t think of this obvious solution. Even Marquez couldn’t imagine someone of Biden’s depravity.

That’s some nice writin’ there my man. I’ve often contemplated the same, how the GAE took corruption to the highest level all while cloaking itself in faux morality. Hypocrisy is the coin of the GAE realm.

                Latin America is still a masculine culture so when it comes time to stage a coup, the course of action is obvious, focused, and pragmatic. The US is now a faggy gyno-empire. When women go bad(-er), they always put on a big show of self-righteous moralizing. The ultimate example is Hillary who invariably painted herself as a saint while plotting multiple murders in the background.

Wide World of Sports is in the little republic of San Marcos where we’re going to bring you a live, on the spot assassination. They’re going to kill the president of this lovely Latin American country and replace him with a military dictatorship. And everybody is about as excited and tense as can be. The weather on this Sunday afternoon is perfect; and if you’ve just joined us, we’ve seen a series of colorful riots that started with the traditional bombing of the American embassy – a ritual as old as the city itself.– Bananas, 1971

        This cuts Biden too much slack. That speech with the red backdrop and the marines standing there, he sure looked like an eager participant. “Our patience is wearing thin.” I don’t know if that was scripted or not, but he definitely put some extra emphasis on it. Not just some guy reading a line. He meant it. Perhaps these things were part of what spooked some of the overlords who decided to back Trump.

        Joe Biden was far more evil in his personal life than Eichmann ever was. The affabale bumbling idiot that was his public face was only a mask. Joe was, and will be until the devil comes to take him, a Robber Baron at heart, whoring himself out for money and power. He bet on the ideologues in his party and double crossed the other Robber Baron in Hilary Clinton, and the ideologues used him just as much as he used them.

            Biden’s biggest sin was his limited intellect. Everything was filtered through a prism of averageness before it reached his brain. The consequence of this was a man who wanted to take the terrible risk of deposing Putin. He saw things in black and white, not the shades of gray the world is usually perceived to be. Biden’s death will be a victory of normalizing fate over entropy.

                    To the extent it says anything, it’s completely wrong. It’s the failure to see the world in black and white, insisting that smart people see the nuances in shades of gray, that gave us the “tolerant” culture of moral relativism of today.
That’s the real failing of us modern olds — way too many of us were taken in by the snake oil, way too many incapable of saying, “No! That is wrong!” As a consequence, in lieu of wisdom, we offered pap.

                    Greg-AI is “yammering” as his programming tells “him” to.  He’s a great experiment if you consider him as an AI program, rather than a human commentator who reads this blog and comments as to his opinion.
Note: Greg-AI really has no opinion as that has not been perfected/programmed yet.  He simply gathers words and attempts to respond by repeating those words in a different order with minor modifications and additions.  Hence today’s word salad.  If Greg-AI ever does make sense “he” will have achieved “AGI” or Artificial General Intelligence—the current “Holy Grail” of the AI community.

            Many years ago, long before he was president, I read an MSM article (it must have been, because back then that was the only kind of news I got), which I can’t cite specifically, but I remember it because it made an impression. It quoted Joe, who was justifying the unethical/illegal action of some prior president (maybe it was Clinton? LBJ? Can’t recall). Anyhow, this unethical/illegal thing served to increase the president’s power. And Joe said that was justified because “he got away with it.” One of those things that stays with you. Apologies for the lack of specifics, I’d have saved it if I could. I am not making this up.

                If tracking it down is important to you, Harry Reid cited Biden as his moral compass when he was pushed about lying about Mitt’s taxes when Mitt was the candidate. I don’t remember the specifics of the Biden referent, either, but that’s got to be less emetic than going through 50 years of Biden.

            It is in fact a mistake to conflate sociopathy with intelligence. While many sociopaths are brilliant, most are like Biden, garbage tier opportunists with enough cunning to skate through life and sometimes accumulate mass fortunes in the process. Good point about the exploitation of ideologues, by the way, which goes to the opportunism aspect. The symbiotic relationship between the fanatics and the bloodless predators served Biden well.
A system that elevated Biden to the pinnacle of power in and of itself is sociopathic.

                Yea, I think calling him a “garbage tier opportunist with enough cunning to skate through life” is perfect. Biden’s reputation for decades was as a corrupt, affable stooge. A total lightweight who was always looking for the bag. They called him Biden (D-MBNA) for a reason. His presidential run in the 1980s was an embarrassment, like Chris Christie tier (Donald DUCK!). As VP he was basically told to sit in the corner and shut up. The transformation of him into a combination of Pericles, Abe Lincoln, and FDR is very, very, very new.

                “A system that elevated Biden to the pinnacle of power in and of itself is sociopathic.”Here’s an example of your decline into sociopathy.Biden came into office in the Senate in 1972.  If I recall as one of the youngest ever elected to such office.  It was a bad time for the nation with Nixon, Vietnam, and government in general.  This lead to Carter.  Carter (the worst President ever before Biden) lead to Reagan.  (Ford was inconsequential.)Reagan was an “actor”, a divorced man, and oldest in the modern era to run for the Presidency.  These were serious issues at the time and lead the opinion pieces in all the MSM.  When Biden ran for the Presidency, “crickets”.In those days of beginning decline, the MSM was still somewhat unbiased wrt to the investigation of character/background of candidates.  Personal aspects of behavior/background were still investigated and brought to light.  The MSM has declined from what it was in 1980 to what it is in 2020-2024.  Forty years and the media is now simply another cog in the woke machine.

                    Yes. Relatedly, there also are two contradictory things at play here. The first, as you point out, is that the “news” now is blatant propaganda, with heavy use of omission. This was always true to a lesser extent–Uncle Walter was a shameless, pathological liar and shill, for example–but not to today’s degree. OTOH, social media allows everything to be dissected and examined in real time and diminishes the value of propaganda. This is why there was such a fevered attempt at censorship.The less blatant propaganda that did not have the ability to be checked was highly effective. Today’s is quite Soviet, easily disregarded from a purely factual standpoint but absorbed to try to understand the purpose behind it.

Yep, that and it allows “everyone” to be a commentator—not just clowns like Walter Cronkite.  If you can type, think, and put together a sound commentary you can generate a audience the like of which Cronkite could only dream.

                        I wanted to mention this, but passed on it.  During my tenure at University, our building was right next to the Journalism School.  I knew the Dean and was witness to the transformation to “advocacy” journalism.  It spread like a cancer attracting all sorts of woke students.  However, at that time I was pretty naive and only began to understand what was happening after I retired.

            Joe Biden was far more evil in his personal life than Eichmann ever was.
Eichmann had to be kept in a soundproofed glass box during his “trial” to prevent him from letting slip that most of his work for Hitler’s government had been as a liaison to the Zionist community of the time, many of whom comprised the then-Israeli government.

        The life of Joe Biden and now his looming death, has been in service to the destruction of social trust.This inadvertently makes him a hero. That aside, while I agree that Biden was a useful idiot who became the Eichmann of Woke (good phrase), do not underestimate how malignant he was. To bolster his political fortunes, Biden falsely accused a man of killing his family in a drunken driving accident, by way of example. He richly deserves to die a prolonged, painful death for his many crimes against individuals and humanity.There has been a succession of events–Covid, a stolen election, and now the revelation that Biden was a powerless figurehead and puppet (outside of Trump to a degree, this always was the case)–that have done irreversible damage to the United States government’s credibility. It is a multi-chapter Chernobyl, but the nation still has the wealth and power, no matter how diminished, to placate the populace. I continue to believe it will stagger along until the next financial crisis, at which point it will fall apart almost immediately. The Great Sort indicates this is a widely shared belief. Everything D.C. does now is to push off that inevitable day of reckoning.We all thought of ourselves as the Good Guy during the Cold War.There were no Good Guys.No matter how banal, evil is evil.

                        A key feature of every evil and/or totalitarian system is how it degrades and then co-opts the people within it to maintain power. There is a myth that such systems rule solely by force. The truth is most have widespread support. It may require killing the dissidents to get to that point, to be clear, but in addition to a heavy hand there are carrots. In the GAE, that is money.

                        If you have been following stocks for any length of time, you have to have come to the realization that stocks have decoupled from whatever the company does. For a while in 2008, the p/E went over 100, that is, you buy a stock which, on fundamentals, will return your investment in 100 years, not including inflation. Today it’s in the mid 20s? When Reagan took office it was in single digits?
That’s why front running has become as effective as it is. Why Gamestop worked. It’s not about the company. It’s about the scam.

                                I’m talking S&amp;P in general. I’m not cherry picking just the ones that support my point.
But the fact you can find single digit p/E as well as triple digit p/E in the same market sector should underscore the notion that it is no longer the fundamentals that matter. Solyndra looked great, regardless of the actual numbers. Until it didn’t. All that changed was the illusion.

                    The debt is impossible to ever repay. If the country could have gotten the spending down it could have at least maintained the viability of the bond market. The deficit economy will turn the bond market into a farce over time and make their repayment suspect. The downgrade is way overdue. The inability to cut spending is the sign the end is near.

                        Its already a farce.  QE when you cut out all the fancy words is essentially the market will not buy our bonds at interest rates we think we should get, so we’re just going to set rates at 0.  If they think they can dictate the market, why wouldn’t they be able to dictate to you?

                        It’s amazing how few people seem to even ask if part of the reason for Trump’s cost cutting and DOGE efforts is the desire to avoid a debt death spiral. We must be getting pretty close to where current revenue just barely covers the interest on the debt. Well, would you look at that –https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A091RC1Q027SBEAIf Trump really is trying to cut spending enough to avoid this, he’s got every single one of the various noisy lobbies against him. America is now just a crowd of hobos each rattling his tin cup and stepping in front of the others to grab every shiny dime.

                The only thing holding the country together now is its relative wealth. I don’t think it survives another economic cataclysm no matter how authoritarian it becomes in trying to hold things together.

                I’m not convinced the pain will be as bad for “us” as it will be for the politicos and sheeple, though. When the EBT cards start getting declined, those who have not made plans will have to count on luck to get through. The grasshoppers will feel a lot of pain, yes, but the ants will mostly get by just fine.

                        True, but most dystopian novels are completely unrealistic. Shut off the power and in days the diseases the sanitation system has kept in check are running rampant.
The hordes soon become the more manageable gangs and warlords that Selco talks about. But in a country much more spread out. The fuel required to get much further than the exurbs is just too precious to squander.

                    The plan/reality has been to demonize whites, who are the ants, and to take their stuff and give it to the nons, who are the grasshoppers. That doesn’t seem to be off the table, either. As Compsci mentioned, look at how the ants live in Latin America: behind heavily guarded gates wrapped in barb wire and driven by armed guards on the constant look out for kidnappers. That’s not fine with me.
I never thought the planned redistribution would be easy, and it very well may be impossible, but that is/was the future planned for us.

                        I understand that’s the plan. If the collapse so many predict comes to pass, the grasshoppers will be no more. The only question is whether enough ants pull through to make a difference.

                    There are about a million other things that will fail before the EBT cards. That might be the last thing standing. If a loaf of bread is $5,000, then the accounts will be loaded up with $200,000 a month.

            I agree that most if not all of what we were told about the Cold War were myths and psyops.
BUT I would say the Russian Communists/Bolsheviks were the greater evil at the time.  Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky, Yagoda,Kaganovich, etc.  This is what it looks like when the “woke” are unleashed in all their bloody hatred masked in moral piety.
They were so evil, that a strong case can be made that it would’ve been a better world if they were destroyed instead of the Nazis in WWII as Patton said before being whacked.

                I don’t disagree at all. But to be clear, just because the communists were far worse doesn’t mean we were good. A lot of the post-Cold War oppression was kept in abeyance until it was safe to unleash it.

        Biden is the archetypal post-civil rights American politician.  A smirking car salesman who saw his chance as a mediocrity to make it big.  To do so by happily being a puppet, enrich himself, and “represent” his country by totally and utterly selling them out and reducing the founding stock to a besieged minority.  And to present this as a good thing!  He deserves the lowest pit of Hell.

                Actual historical fascism was as contrary to the American right (liberalism with traditionalist characteristics, increasingly deformed by libertarianism and proto-“woke” Christianity) as it was to the left.
Fascism would be the greatest threat to them both, if it existed. So everyone agreed to hide it behind a horror story.
Not even “neonazis” today know what fascism was. They put on the Halloween costume and submit to ritual punching.

        I still remember after Brandon “won” the election and started appointing people, one shitlib commentator gushed about how “normal” the people were compared to the meanies that Trump hired (of course, by 2020, the people in the White House were third-rate at best, and they all were working to destroy Trump). The normal people that this person was talking about, of course, were people like Mayorkas and Blinken. Total freaks. And long after Joe Biden is dead, hopefully soon, judged by God and sent to his rightful place, these freaks will still be out there, and most importantly, so will the evil spirit which animates them.

Is “total freaks” the phrase that we are using now for the more obvious descriptor?

Our ancestors knew. They fought. They lost, because they did not fight hard enough because they were too comfortable and arrogant to understand that it was utterly existential. It’s long, but read the whole thing. So many books down the memory, fished out and put into the light by megachad Ron Unz.

This is why the Russians are going to win. They don’t talk about it in public, but they know and they are NEVER going to let these minions of Satan rule over them ever again.

                Because most peoplerefuse to acknowledge the existence of evil, let alone their own, just how quickly things devolve will be a shock to a lot of people.  Yes, it’s a dystopian trope to expect others to attack you and try to take anything you have, but it’s also a truth based on centuries of human behavior.  No, most people aren’t ‘good at heart’ and that lie is totally counter to biblical teaching yet pushed the most by today’s churchian.

                    indeed.  That is why the meme of NPC (non player characters) has been going around for some time.  We all remember the cruelness of high school and such, but the difference between and evolved human and one who never moves beyond is realizing that cruelness can easily just be put back right on you.  Generally something has to happen for one to get to this point:“It was granted me to carry away from my prison years on my bent back, which nearly broke beneath its load, this essential experience:howa human being becomes evil andhowgood. In the intoxication of youthful successes I had felt myself to be infallible, and I was therefore cruel. In the surfeit of power I was a murderer, and an oppressor. In my most evil moments I was convinced that I was doing good, and I was well supplied with systematic arguments. And it was only when I lay there on rotting prison straw that I sensed within myself the first stirrings of good. Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either—but right through every human heart—and through all human hearts. This line shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained. And even in the best of all hearts, there remains … an unuprooted small corner of evil.”

Most people tend to project their morality on others. It is why most good people are easy victims because they can’t envision actual malicious intent. Conversely, it helps to encourage evil behavior among anti-social individuals because in their minds, “everybody else does it.”
P.S. This is why our ancestors were smart to immediately remove anti-social individuals and bloodlines from the gene pool. Imo, more crimes should require the death penalty than just murder.

        “accuse ordinary Americans of being evil, for the crime of living their lives as white people”
It’s getting harder and harder to not end up tied to a stake in the center of town with kindling around your feet and Elizabeth Warren holding a torch. The Reign of Terror ended when your average Frenchman looked at the guillotine and said, that could be me next.

        Dark Brandon. He was pure evil. As for managerialism, someone hires,  promotes and rewards the managers. We know who they are. You can follow the money and you can see who sits on the board.The Regime creates and relies upon sniveling cowards. I once had a conversation with a man from Montenegro. He told me his story of how he came here. In the mid 90s he was an equivalent of a green beret. One night, he and his unit were in a firefight and they found themselves surrounded in the dark. In the hellstorm he was in a ditch that had a deep recess covered in grass. In the lights he saw the faces of the attackers. They were the sons and nephews of the men in the guard that was ambushed. It is only their callous laziness that wanted butchery but no cleanup operation of removing the bodies that gave him a chance to escape when the coast was clear. How he got out alive was quite a real life Montenegran Rambo’s journey.One thing about this Revolution we are living through strikes me as creating that kind of animosity. The anti-White pogrom has produced a class of White whose response isn’t to find courage and collectivize but to into an even more extreme individualism of total cowardice. The signaling mechanisms of the Regime are powerful and everyone knows who and what everyone is. I have seen first hand these cowards slam doors cut off contact jab the knife in the back out of fear of not being one of the baddies who wants to defend himself. The job, the house payment, the dead end life of impotence with the goth man-hating wife and the consolations of video games in the basement are too precious to lose by being sullied by associations.Of course, Biden and Walz are the poster children and exemplars of those sniveling cowards. Hopefully the temperature can stabilize and The Regime will permit some ability to withdraw and build outside. If they don’t we may well produce ex-pat janitors in Latin America telling some guy a story that sounds kind of like what happened in Montenegro not too long ago. It would be fitting that Clinton oversaw the kindling of the conditions that fostered such an environment. Another manager who was not benevolent but who was in the end demonically possessed in carrying out a program of pure evil.

            It’s the conservative men who I think are the lowest cowards. Libs like Biden or Clinton or waltz are almost forgivable because they actually beleive in multiracialismZ it’s conservatives that should know better. And it’s not even the job or the wife, it seems to be being  seen as clinging to a morality that most people say is past; that mankind has progressed and we all see that whites must view the foreigner as closer to him as their own even their own children.these men would rather see their children and grandchildren engulfed and destroyed by tides of color than commit a sin against the new morality. It’s these conservatives that I have to pray to not hate

                I think you give the conservatives too much credit for having or holding ideals. If we look at the results the only ideal that comes out of Washington is “Where’s Mine”. They all appear to be amoral; only believing in what will help themselves.
If you read Brutus 1 of the Anti-Federalist papers, he predicted all of this in 1787. He wrote that men would turn against the country for their own gain once they became wealthy enough.

        I have to admit I don’t have much sympathy for Biden.  He was a corrupt, lying dirtbag politician from the very beginning and perhaps much worse in his private life.  Further, it seems White people will never be free of the shackles of slavery or the holohoax.

        Excellent essay, Z. I’ve believed for quite some time that the U.S. is a zealous, ideological empire, but its ideological zealotry is cloaked by the liberal language of its founding and Constitution.Your point about politicians running cover for “The System” by giving it a smiling, happy face was true in other ideological systems as well, like the USSR. Not for nothing did many Soviets look fondly on “Uncle Joe” Stalin, so it’s interesting that we had our own “Uncle Joe.”Of course, when comparing the two “Uncle Joes,” I am reminded of Marx’s pity observation that history repeats itself “first as tragedy, then as farce.”

        In an earlier comment I omitted this point, which is important:
We are now at the stage where obvious truths are not obvious truths until officialdom declares them to be so. Everyone saw Biden’s blatant frailty/dementia, but it was not a reality until the Regime and its propaganda organs officially declared it. That’s some real Soviet shit there. Will he be unpersoned next? It will depend on how the official pronouncement of the obvious objective reality goes.

        The “banality of evil” only applies because, despite all evidence to the contrary, people still somehow expect to see evidence of people’s character on their faces.  And yes, sometimes evil people are extremely ugly (see Harvey Weinstein) so it’s easy to say “physiognomy is real.”  But in reality, there are far more evil people whose facesreflect their confidence in themselves and their place on the ‘right side of history.’  Almost all politicians and high-level managers are more like Dorian Gray, presenting themoney, self confidence, and power that backstop their lies and crimes in a smooth public visage.And these people don’t see themselves as evil, so in that sense the presentation is not a lie.  Just like almost everyone else, they think they are essentially ‘good’ people – it’s a rare man who will admit (to himself and others) not just his misdeeds but his basic character defects.  Sure, ‘mistakes were made,’ but they did it for ‘the greater good.’

            Outside of cartoon figures like Alastair Crowley, has any historical figure admitted he was evil? Has he said, my objective is to do as much harm as possible to the maximum number of the most innocent people and other beings? If so, I’m not aware of it. Every villain from history claims to have been doing a good thing when he tortured, raped and slaughtered.

        I am bewildered by the relative success of the BKCPP propaganda organs’ effort to frame the installation of Dementia Joe as the result of his gang’s successful subterfuge. That husk of Dorian Gray was soiling himself in front of cameras from day one and they had to hide him in a basement while they printed up mountains of fraudulent ballots. The admin should say so publicly and repeatedly. Show the news videos of everyone ignoring him and fawning over Obama at various State events. No one with an IQ high enough to bring a fork to their own mouth believed DJ was actually President.

                The problem is, communism, fascism and liberal democracy are intensely social as well as governmental. Perhaps the question is, can we have a governmental system that is not also social?

                    No, we cannot. The “greater good” for society is the fig leaf that makes rule by our lessers bearable, or even to some minds, desirable.
It’s the same old deal Satan always offers, and man always falls for it.

                Oh, we can build such a system. Problem is it only scales for low multiples of Dunbar’s number, and relies heavily on decentralization, what Catholics call “subsidiarity”. Until we accept the empirical evidence, and reject the ideologue’s vision of nation-states, we will have to suffer through the same old crap that Westphalia brought into existence.

        I don’t think the use of the word “banality” in this context is useful. It tends to undersell the impact of the evil that Biden has wrought. No one is going to rise up and fight to the death against a “banal” tyrant. The word actually means boring or lacking in originality. Biden played a seminal role in the mRNA rollout which has infected billions with this time-released poison. That death toll will eventually number in the hundreds of millions or higher; far more than anything Hitler, Stalin, or Mao could ever dream of. Biden is megadeath personified.

            That’s why I personally dislike Arendt; she was downplaying and trivializing real evil, since our own side was committing so much of it.
You see, that’s how trauma conditioning works, why those nearer the era are stuck in amber; when one has been madecomplicit,even unknowingly, the weight of guilt and shame is too great to bear.  What “washes” the brain of such sins is to come to identify with the planners and the necessity of their cause.

        Some of this reaction is “recency bias”, some is legitimate outrage. We have had many mediocre “machine politicians” become President – A. Johnson, Hayes, Arthur, McKinley, Taft, Truman, Obama and recently Biden (I’m probably missing some). And corruption isn’t a new thing. I think the main difference now is the absolute size and power of the Federal Government – bad Presidents can do more damage. Also, Arthur, McKinley and Truman didn’t hate Americans, so they ended up outperforming expectations. Biden just hates us, probably because he is so mediocre.

        “It was hard to hate men like Eichmann, even after their actions had been universally condemned, because they were not obviously evil men. That was always the point of Joe Biden and why the managerial class loved him. He was a simpleton and braggard, but he would ruthlessly execute his instructions and do so in a way that was hard for the people to hate. He normalized evil by making it feel like the way things were done and had to be done. Joe Biden is the banality of evil.”The difference between these two men is one of them hated his own kind and the other didn’t.  Hating your own kind and working against them could be the ultimate evil.And considering the holocaust never happened, Eichmann really wasn’t evil at all.

        Speaking of banality, I posted this over at the Treehouse:“….more likely the plan was for Joe Biden to win in 2024, then reveal the cancer, step down and Kamala Harris would be installed.”Yes, Kamala as President was surprisingly the intent; she and her parents were members groomed by the same Communist cell that groomed Obama and Holder, under the leadership of Khalid Rashidi in San Francisco. (Rashidi also obtained Obama’s Saudi sponsorship.)The cell and Black Muslim movement itself was another tentacle undoubtedly under the direction of our Intelligence services, with CIA (Obama’s parents and grandparents) handling the foreign networks and FBI (the Elijah Muhummid movement) handling the domestic networks.Yes, Kamala was a complete dimwit who had a long career failing upward; she was merely a face who would do whatever her handlers told her, a human autopen.She would’ve been Obama’s fourth term, ushering in the Revolution, the final fundamental transformation into a totalitarian Maoist (race-based) state.(Marxism is a class-based state, that is, an economic caste system. Maoism is a racial birthright caste system, with the new twist of gender added.)Kamala’s grandfather Gopalan was the right-hand man of Ken Kuanda, one of the three African Communist dictators who destroyed Rhodesia and turned it into Zimbabwe (Mugabe) and Zambia (Kuanda).Kamala would have done the same to America, in conjunction with the eradication of South Africa, the overthrow of west Europe, the UK, Ireland, Australia, Canada, and turning east Europe into a giant Ukraine.==p.s.- what goes beyond Maoist race/gender castes? Classifications based on human genetic modification; that is, not just cloned or engineered embyos, but also including the genetic modifications introduced by mRNA.Some of us will be embedded nodes in the Internet of Bodies, the Beast system.That’s why they have to cull the weak or unsuitable links.Some will be born slaves, engineered or modified in the womb.—————————————-I left out this part.This is the messianic vision of Tikkun Olam, the Perfected World.A new lifeform is trying to be born, a flawed copy built on the old; it is both a driver of, and a response to, the dearth of White people. Trying to be a cyborg alternate to what we are.That the people of the North might be turned into the body, the corpus of the Mosiach…the ultimate Horse to ride.

        “It was hard to hate men like Eichmann, even after their actions had been universally condemned, because they were not obviously evil men.”The Third Reich had little use for evil men. It needed capable technocrats and functionaries — people like Speer and Heydrich. Eichmann’s defence was that he was “just following orders.” Which was correct — he was just following orders. So were Himmler, Heydrich, and Speer. The demons in hell will also just be following orders — their mortgages and middle-class lifestyle in hell might otherwise be endangered. You have to go along to get along.Arendt’sEichmann in Jerusalemis still well worth reading. It’s also worthwhile learning about the experiments of Stanley Milgram in the late 1960s, when he tried to discover whether ordinary people — not psychopaths — could be ordered by authority figures to inflict pain on others. A  more recent book, but still 20 or 30 years old, is Zygmunt Bauman’sModernity and the Holocaust, where, if memory serves, he argues that tech modernity breeds its own diabolical rationale — the kind you see with Robert McNamara in the Vietnam war or the kind you see in the film,Dr. Strangelove.Another book that’s just come to mind and related to your thesis that the anti-human forces prevailing in the USA are fronted by grinning ghouls like Biden is Bertam Gross’Friendly Fascism.

            The Milgram experiment has become controversial and its results should likely be discounted to a significant degree. One alternative explanation for those results would be that the majority of participants who thought the experiment was real defied authority while the majority who thought it was fake followed authority. Inducing players to commit atrocities in a video game is easy, as it turns out. There is also a significant cultural factor to how a given person will respond to a given authority in being commanded to commit a certain “evil”, which blank-slate liberalism likes to pretend is not a factor.World War II and the Holocaust are not the stories you were told. If the forbidden history tends to be accurate, then the ethos of the world’s ruling class was to kill as many as possible in order to force the other side’s capitulation. This was always a failed strategy as existential crises lead to defiance rather than surrender. The better view is that the ruling ethos was to break enemy nations so they could never contest again, which was best done by mass slaughter, and everyone did it. The Japanese troops may have been the most psychopathic about it, with Europe and Russia at large not terribly far behind. The American troops were the most ethical, and the German troops likely in second place. The Soviet ruling class was the worst, likely followed by the European ruling class. I am not sure where the Japanese Emperor and his ruling class fits here. The American ruling class chose to be the lackeys of evil – the closest to the banality of evil that you will find.The given rationale of “faster surrender” was always post-hoc war propaganda for willful industrial slaughter. Germany was scapegoated for the sins committed by all, in order to continue to break the nation, for the simple reason that the powers that be in Britain and Zionism did not want their like to rise again.“Banality of evil” is largely the “presentism” or Historian’s Fallacy, which are the newest ways to say that moderns are projecting their faux morality into the past. As stated, Progressives are okay with terrorism and killing their ideological enemies; they only pretend not to be so that what they do to others is not done to them.

            I’ve read that Milgram’s and the other famous experiment were complete frauds, with possibly Usual Suspects involved as well.
In other words, deliberate propaganda to support the overall Narrative that began with “The Authoritarian Personality”.

                What I have read, but can. It produce citations is that the main problem with Milgram is he “cherry picked” most of his examples were not the majority of his subjects.  Indeed the minority.  Most of his subjects told him to “got to hell” and did not comply.

        One thought on managerialism…it excels at breaking processes down so each step is done most efficiently by a specialist.  In this context that also removes “total” responsibility for outcome from individuals. “I just processed transit manifests and scheduled trains”–that these trains ended up at Auschwitz or Sobibor was not that individuals responsibility.  Gas chambers, run minimally by SS staff evolved because the Einsatzgruppen (the one group not removed from the actual business of killing), despite the number of certified sociopaths, were effectively losing their minds.  Our modern, massive bureaucracies operate the same way…most completely removed from the havoc they create.

                            Most of this is just overgeneralization. That if someone asserts Zyklon-B existed, that was the cause of everything.
I’m highly skeptical of the 6 million figure, though my HS German teacher was not. He thought it was entirely possible, though it was largely through starvation, not deliberate executions. The only reason he survived starvation was because his dad was Wehrmacht, and a couple of his older brothers deployed in the Hitler Youth after Normandy, so he and his younger siblings got extra rations.

            “Einsatzgruppen (the one group not removed from the actual business of killing), despite the number of certified sociopaths, were effectively losing their minds.”
This of course, and the fact that roving groups of sociopaths killing thousands across newly conquered territories was a public spectacle, a “bad look”, and eventually would cause resistance in the populace.  Much more efficient to “deport” such undesirables to remote camps for elimination out of public sight.

                Despite the drawbacks of the model used, Saml’s demonstration of the process is excellent.
But, efficient? You try wrestling farmers shooting at you into a cattle car. The Einsatzgruppen were sent to kill the partisans who were brutally torturing and murdering lawfully uniformed troops Apache-style, in the same manner they did later to British troops in Hebron. Of course they were losing their minds; they were Catholic men having to judge and execute possibly innocent people on the spot as well as discover the hideous remains of their brother soldiers. I doubt the majority were Gallician Banderistas using axes.

        One of the things Arendt and other Saturday people got wrong about 1933-1945 was refusing to see their model of how things worked was wrong. The YT dude Whatifalthist notes that the confinement to the Ghetto of Saturday people from roughly 1100 AD to the mid 19th Century in most of Europe led to an unnatural pattern.Everyone within worked in a high trust society where most were related however distantly to each other. Society was “flat” with little to no hierarchy. There was no warrior caste nor even the possibility of being a soldier or Watchman. All food and security was provided by outsiders, and hyper specialization in things like gold smithing, silver smithing, tailoring, alongside banking and lending and so one led to a closed off society that thought passing laws made things happen. There was almost no leadership, i.e. charismatic and organizationally gifted men who organized other men into lethal and deadly combinations, from say the East India Trading Company to Wallenstein and Napoleon.This history left the Saturday people who did not emigrate early to the South of the US totally unprepared for the reality of industrialization which made organization and charisma even more deadly than in the Early Modern Era. Their solutions then and now were simply, “moar laws” because in the Ghetto, those got enforced by social pressure and outsiders by force. It is why they were attracted to Communism (reflecting the social flatness and equality of the Ghetto) and “fixes” to smooth out Industrial society, and why they had no real ability to stop either bad mustache man.

        “Perhaps the most substantive and influential Jewish treatment of the topic during this period came inThe Origins of Totalitarianism, the classic 1951 work of political philosophy published byHannah Arendt, a German-Jewish emigre scholar who had come to America in 1941 and spent the next decade heavily immersed in Jewish and Zionist circles. Given the very considerable length and depth of the book, she had probably begun working on it during the Nuremberg Tribunals or in their immediate aftermath, and she devoted several pages to the Holocaust, drawing upon the facts documented during those landmark war crime trials. However, her personal expertise and focus was philosophy and ideology rather than history, so she primarily emphasized that the fanatical Nazi project to exterminate all of Europe’s Jews severely detracted from the German war effort, thereby demonstrating the utter “madness” of Hitler and his ruling regime.In a lengthy footnote, she also debunked some of the popular misconceptions surrounding that issue, pointing out that the gripping visual images of starved, emaciated corpses and survivors that had so horrified the American public at the end of the war were totally unrealistic and had nothing to do with the Holocaust since the Germans hadn’t used starvation as their method of killing. Instead, she suggested those scenes reflected the total breakdown of German organization in the last days of the war due to America’s strategic bombing campaign, a claim that many others have more recently made.Rereading Novick’s book did remind me of one important point that I’d previously forgotten. Raoul Hilberg’s weighty 1961 volumeThe Destruction of the European Jewsis universally acknowledged as having ignited the scholarly study of the Holocaust. But Novick suggests that the considerable success of Hilberg’s book, which eventually launched an entire scholarly discipline, was probably due to its fortuitous timing.During the 1930s the Zionist movement had forgedan important economic partnership with Nazi Germany, which laid the basis for the eventual creation of the state of Israel. The Nazi liaison officer to the Zionists was Adolf Eichmann, who studied Hebrew and became known as something of a philo-Semite. After the resounding Allied victory in the war, those dangerous secrets of Zionist history were deeply suppressed, but during the mid-1950s they suddenly threatened to leak out again into the media, perhaps with very serious political repercussions for Israel’s standing with America and the other Western nations. Possibly as a consequence, the Israeli government soon undertook a major effort to track down and eliminate their former close Nazi collaborator. After kidnapping Eichmann in 1960, the Israelis staged a high-profile show trial heavily focused upon the horrors of the Holocaust and culminating in Eichmann’s 1962 execution. Novick plausibly argues that Hilberg’s book owed much of its success to its release in the middle of that media extravaganza.https://www.unz.com/runz/american-pravda-gaza-jewish-power-and-the-holocaust/

            A day late and a dollar short on this one, at the office all day.Arendt was predictably wrong on nearly everything. Just like Lenin, the German bad mustache man (he was not the founder of his movement also) used bio-Leninist psychopaths who liked hurting/killing others as key people in administering things. For example the Camp Kommandant at Auschwitz was a convicted Weimar era murderer who beat to death an informant against him. Even the SS dudes at the Camps had a suicide rate of 15% as killing people who looked like their relatives and were mostly women and children and old people was not exactly the glory they’d been promised.The lie was that normal people were the threat. Instead it is the freaks, as always. Freaks are a danger, and doubly so if they ever, ever get near power: Nero, Caligula, the Borgias, these names stay with us for a reason.The lesson of 1933-45 is not impractical control over ordinary people down to the atomic level lest they “turn evil” like some Joss Whedon “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” character. Nor is it wiping out White people on the theory that they will turn evil so just get rid of them. See: Gaza, and Hamas. No, the lesson is get rid of freaks early, and do not tolerate them.Fun fact, a discussion with a senior co-worker today, regarding commuting to Beverly Hills (which sucks). No freeway near it, and our office will move there in 2026. You have to go through traffic something like 5-8 miles just to get to Beverly Blvd. Transit is a no go, my senior co worker (age 55, high in the company, good dude) went on the metro once. That was enough. Tweaking meth heads, weirdo homeless, freaks of every kind, urine and feces all through the station, the cars, etc. Lesson: freaks degrade everything and belong in a facility of some kind.

        Hannah Arendt correctly saw the Eichmann trial as a turning point in the moral evolution of Jewish people, as their desire for revenge was taking them down the exact same path that had animated the Communists and Fascists. We now see the fruition of this thinking as we watch the Israelis slaughter tens of thousands of innocent Palestinian women and children.

            How one would prevent the extant government from converting pipes intended for water distribution systems into rockets?I don’t gainsay the innocents part. I’m just saying if Chicago started using the resources they get from expropriating landowners in southern Illinois  to attack cities in Indiana, does Indiana really have a choice but to bomb Chicagoans in an attempt to stop their government from lobbing rockets hidden in those people’s homes into Indiana, killing Hoosiers?To be sure, I wouldn’t be in favor of bombing the southern Illinoians — they are victims, too, albeit lesser victims than the Hoosiers. But if a million to one is what it takes to dissuade Chicago?

        This post brings an intriguing perspective on Arendt’s “banality of evil” and applies it in a modern context that’s both unsettling and revealing. The comparison between Eichmann and Biden is provocative, highlighting how individuals who may not be overtly malicious can still play pivotal roles in sustaining systems of harm. It’s an important reminder that the true danger of ideologies isn’t always in the fanatical leaders, but in the millions of ordinary people who, like Eichmann, unquestioningly serve the machinery of oppression, thinking of themselves as just doing their jobs.That said, I think the analogy with Joe Biden, while interesting, risks oversimplifying the complexities of contemporary politics. Biden may represent a kind of system—part of a larger political establishment that many find problematic—but to directly equate him to Eichmann’s role in the Holocaust seems a stretch. Eichmann was a key architect of mass murder, a person who actively sought to implement policies of genocidal violence. Biden, even if criticized for his policies or role in perpetuating certain systems, is not operating in that same moral space. The comparison might blur the significant difference between a politician working within a democratic framework, however flawed, and a bureaucrat in a fascist regime carrying out orders that result in mass death.Moreover, while it’s easy to label figures like Biden or any politician as part of a “managerial class” or the machinery of an impersonal system, I think it’s worth considering that not all political figures in contemporary democracies serve with the same ethical indifference as Eichmann did. Some, despite their participation in broader systems of governance, do attempt to balance moral considerations in their decisions.That said, your central point about how systems of power often normalize evil through ordinariness is powerful and important. The danger is indeed that we often don’t recognize the harm until it’s too late, because it’s wrapped in familiar, comfortable packages. We need to stay vigilant against the insidious ways ideologies and systems shape behavior, especially when they can disguise themselves as being morally neutral or even virtuous.This is a challenging and thought-provoking piece that raises important questions about complicity, power, and the everyday ways in which we can become agents of harm without even realizing it. It’s a call to self-reflection about the systems we’re part of and the quiet ways in which we might be helping to perpetuate them.

            Good comment.Joe Biden was a known corrupt and stupid politician. He was also a man of very low moral character.The clowns in the circus we call congress should have gone after him and punished him through impeachment for the crimes that were on his sons laptop. What we got from them instead was crickets; not a word about his corruption with possibly the exception of Rand Paul. Their behavior implies they are unable to take the scrutiny that would come from pointing out the sitting president is corrupt.Impeaching J. B. would have been low hanging fruit for Congress. It would have allowed for the veneer of honesty to be improved in DC. They were unwilling to remove their puppet. It is impossible to know if the United States will survive this level of dishonesty at the top level of government. So far it’s not looking good.Your comment is better than a lot of your paid for writing. Interesting to see you here in the Z man comments section.

                        Yeah, this is AI.Tweaked for flattery to lower your guard. The complex sentence structure was always a factor of neural net size and training data. The impressive part is how it works multiple keywords in relation to each other across multiple paragraphs. This is a vastly more powerful system than Greg-AI.Still not thinking. Still entirely normie knowledge base.The conspiracy hat would like to think the bots are here to safeguard the flesh from wrong think, but the DoD has been working on this capability and those systems have to justify their existence somehow. I doubt spamming the local facebook group of some Arab village justifies the budget.The internet has now advanced from the age of porn bots to the age of propaganda bots. Wonderful.

            “Eichmann was a key architect of mass murder”
Eichmann was nothing, a mere SS lieutenant colonel, a gofer for more important figures like Heydrich. If memory serves he was taking minutes like a stenographer at the Wannsee conference in early 1942.
