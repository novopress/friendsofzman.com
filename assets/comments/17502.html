        Quality doesn‚Äôt matter in academia, only quantity. That includes legitimate fields like computer science.
The tendency to repeat and copy past work of others is very feminine and child like. My thesis is that the abundance of citation (which most definitely is a thing) is the product of, among other things, extreme neoteny that we now have, and hyper feminization of our society. Women have to seek consensus before doing things, over citing is a subtle way of signaling that the community agrees (argumentum ad populum).

Most certainly, and that this is a discernable trend in previously respected spheres of society is telling wrt hyper feminization. It reminds me of the Shadow Mother archetype, who smothers her own out of fear of abandonment and resentment of superiority.

            Tacitus, I tend to agree, but also disagree.  It was not uncommon in review of candidates for faculty positions to have their submitted resumes penciled such that often *only* articles in a few respected journals were given credit and examined.  It was a given that folks published everything they could‚Äîthat‚Äôs the name of the game in research oriented universities.  But quantity never got you noticed in and of itself to my perception.  Listing of grants received and amounts were even more important.

                Compsci:I can only go off of my own experiences in academia; what I noticed was that the *number* of top/second tier publications was the best guarantor of when your advisor would let you defend, and students were starting to game that system (but yes, to your point, flooding an application for candidacy with low tier spam would get you laughed at). In my particular subfield (architectures) there were holdouts in the quality realm, but they are losing ground. It was also one of the lowest in estrogen, which was nice. I can also only speak from the perspective of a PhD student, not a faculty candidate.That said, it seems that junior faculty are told to either ‚Äúpublish or perish‚Äù or seek grant money to continue on. Tenure is dangled in front of them (but is becoming increasingly rare, I suspect it will be an anachronism one day), all the while they are forced to teach larger and larger classes of snot nosed undergrads. They are becoming the equivalent of program managers for government contracts, and academia is a business now.(Digressing) It‚Äôs to the point where I am starting to wonder if this student loan conundrum is really a convenient way to force the millennial generation to pay for baby boomers retirement. Can‚Äôt think of any other asset class that grows at 6%, and cannot be waived off in bankruptcy.

                    I‚Äôm certain it depends on the type of institution one belongs to as to how you are judged wrt your vita.  Crap journals and crap research abound and you are correct, at a certain level you can‚Äôt game the system and quantity of low quality will work against you.  That was my point, at my department, it did work against you‚Äîor at least not for you.  And I‚Äôm certain it does at all of the top 20 or so of private and public universities.Grantsmanship is a product of the Fed‚Äôs pouring money into the Universities at prodigious rates.  When I left, the ‚Äúoverhead‚Äù we could charge the Fed‚Äôs was approaching 60%.  Think about what that means.  I write a grant for a few hundred thousand and the University gets more than half.  I‚Äôd be whipping the staff for ‚Äúproductivity‚Äù for those bucks as well.  üòâ

        ‚ÄúLike an old man, who no longer has the energy or courage to question authority, a society gets old and loses its will to question. ‚Äù
More like an old man who, in the 1960s, didn‚Äôt have the energy to discipline his children. Today the children run the house. They are not citing academic sources: they are repeating modern nursery rhymes:
‚ÄúWhite supremacy.‚Äù, ‚ÄúCorporate greed‚Äù, ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs struggles against patriarchy.‚Äù
It makes for great fun, especially for the pampered white daughters of corporate worms.
Except today it‚Äôs called ‚Äúeducation‚Äù.

        OT (but also relevant, in a way), in the midst of the latest teeth-gnashing Abortion Two Minute Hate, it appears that erstwhile presidential candidate Pete Buttplug (D-Collegeworld) has pledged that he will only appoint judges who promise in advance to unconditionally uphold Roe v. Wade, n‚Äôimporte quoi.Think of that.This guy wants to nominate judges who explicitly promise /in advance/ that they will rule on a given case in a certain way, before they have even heard the case.Needless to say, this is the exact opposite of what judges do, or are at least supposed to do.  He wants anti-judges.  Simply put, he wants commissars, political enforcers.And he was not booed off the stage for saying this.  Hell, he wasn‚Äôt even tarred and feathered.Which means that his audience were, in essence, not Americans.  They did not value American civics or basic Western judicial and political theory above their petty ideological wants.  They simply want what they want, and they don‚Äôt care how or why they get it.  That‚Äôs an index of just how stupid we‚Äôve become.IOW:  We have become a nation of negroes.

                That‚Äôs just begging the question.  The real problem is that our abortion ‚Äúlaw‚Äù is not law at all, it is mere judicial fiat.  We never had a robust public debate, followed by a grand symposium in Congress, followed by the passing of relevant legislation, whether pro or con, subject to a Presidential veto, subject to a Congressional override.  Whatever the outcome of that process, THAT would have been the genuine Law of the Land.Instead, nine wizards gazed into their crystal balls and parsed the Magic Document by reading it backwards in upside-down acrostics and secret code, and ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù imaginary ‚Äúrights‚Äù which no sane authority in a 2,000-year-old civilization had ever before promulgated or even countenanced.  No rational person could call this procedure the Law of the Land.That is how you end up with judicial litmus tests, scrutinizing ‚Äúlaw‚Äù which is not actually law.  In the past these were cultural dog-whistles; defining a moral stance is not quite the same thing as upholding a legal particularity.  To promise en avance to uphold a bit of magic wizard-chanting as the foundation of a crucial legal doctrine is not only a new species of stupid, it‚Äôs a new species of evil.

            I have strong opinions regarding abortion (anti), but I have to take the stance that abortion is a complete distraction at this moment in politics and the history of the nation.
Either we take control of our nation (or a remaining piece of it), in which case we can do whatever we want regarding abortion, or we continue on the path to becoming Brazil, in which case who gives a damn, our voices won‚Äôt decide anything.

                Agreed. Abortion isn‚Äôt the hill to die on right now. For many white women, this is the hill that they will die on politically. They won‚Äôt budge, and it keeps their thinking in the past. It‚Äôs hard enough to get middle and upper middle-class white women on our side given the endless propaganda that they ingest daily. Let‚Äôs not make the task impossible by throwing abortion into the mix.

                    The problem is we are not voting our way out of this even with white women on our side.  Demographics will work against us, just slower.  Given that women do not respect weakness, would caving on the issue really make them less hostile anyway?
If they are not having white babies, what is the point of getting white women in our movement?
I can see your point about abortion being a distraction, especially when conservatives use it to prove D3R.  I guess maintaining an anti-abortion stance as a secondary issue is the way to go.

                        Fully funded abortions for all females except for white women is the position we should be advocating for.   We can just sell it as more wokester BS by claiming that white women shouldn‚Äôt be sponging off the POC to fund their abortions.
Once all the POC females sign up for their free abortions ‚Äì then starting putting in quotas.  ‚ÄúEvery POC wymyn must have 5 abortions before their 35th birthday so they‚Äôre not supporting the patriarchy!!‚Äù.
If it‚Äôs free ‚Äì a significant portion of them will go for it.

            37-year-old Mayor Pete also said he wants to abolish the electoral college and not a peep of protest from the audience or host (Chris Wallace on Fox‚Äôs town hall). And he‚Äôs held out as a brilliant guy. Outrageous!The GOP has nothing to offer us, and they do not want to help Trump get re-elected, so, in addition to how great the economy is, we‚Äôre going to hear nothing but abortion talk from them to keep us occupied. So boring! Maybe Republicans were behind that crazy legislation in NY allowing late-term abortions, so as to spark the issue and prompt these several red states to make serious pro-life legislation in response. All to keep the public distracted while the Congress does as they‚Äôre paid to do: Nothing. Maintain the miserable status quo at all costs.

                Abortion and the electoral college are mostly not argued on their own merits.  They are largely totems held up by the leadership of the Left, so that their acolytes may make protestations of fealty to the Leftist cause.

        Maybe they‚Äôre just afraid of the answers that they‚Äôll find if they challenge the current orthodoxy. As you have noted, the Age of Ideology is giving way to the Age of Demographics. They‚Äôre stuck in the Ideological Age because it‚Äôs what they know. They‚Äôre comfortable there and, of course, could get fired questioning it.But I think that it‚Äôs more than that. It‚Äôs frightening to think about just what the Demographic Age means. Besides the fact that you‚Äôd lose your job as an academic talking about it, the Demographic Age feels very simplistic and violent compared to the Ideological Age. Ideas take a backseat to tribe. Debates aren‚Äôt about infinitely malleable concepts but about simple pie splitting.Even the violence of the Demographic Age is petty, dirty and low-level with tribes killing each other over a bit more of the pie. Compare that to the grand violence of the 20th century when Wagnarian wars between great armies were fought over ideas, such as communism, fascism and democracy. Say what you will about the tenets of National Socialism, Dude, at least, it‚Äôs an ethos.The simplicity and petty violence of the Demographic Age just isn‚Äôt something smart people who love to debate ideas want to contemplate. (Our own Steve Sailer is proof of that.) Admittedly, a lot of the reluctance to challenge the current orthodoxy is, of course, fear of punishment, but at least some of it is fear of what they‚Äôll find and what‚Äôs coming.

                I sat through a graduation speech by some black professor in his mid-thirties with both law and medical degrees. MAN did he find himself fascinating! He talked, for instance, about how his White House internship spanned the Obama and Trump administrations and how alienated he felt during the latter. But first we heard all about the black celebrities (‚Äúmusic‚Äù and sportsball) that he met during the former, etc. etc. The lesson he passed on to the graduates about this experience took about one sentence, something like, ‚Äúendeavor to persevere.‚Äù I overheard my daughter telling a friend how the ‚Äúmessage‚Äù of the speech was lost on her. What a shock that she couldn‚Äôt relate to ‚Äúit‚Äôs great to be me.‚Äù

                Grievance studies *were developed for ‚Äúdumb‚Äù people*.  They are pseudo ‚Äúsciences‚Äù which were developed for two reasons: 1) to allow students‚Äîmostly minority‚Äîa ‚Äúfield‚Äù they can successfully major in, and 2) to allow an excuse to hire and promote weak faculty‚Äîagain, mostly minority.  The university benefits in that it keeps its numbers up in the affirmative action and diversity category and gleans $$$ from tuition and grants and such.  Everyone else loses as resources are wasted on these ‚Äúscholars‚Äù (better termed malcontents) who inevitably create an undercurrent of disruption within the university.I must also restate for emphasis here, there is nothing ‚Äúscientific‚Äù in these fields.  The scientific method is not used properly in research published (most always published in so called journals with weak or no peer review) and is the bases for numerous articles demonstrating the un-reproducibility of such ‚Äúresults‚Äù.Not all minority students are of the above ilk, but you must check their major field of study to get an some idea of whether you are interviewing a credentialed fraudster or a potential hire. The same holds true for *all* graduates these days.  Sigh.

And of course each of these hipsters came to these conclusions after decades of sequestered, independent thought, not to mention sleepless nights engaged in painstaking research, deduction, and analysis, which somehow culminated for them at the age of 19. An age age from which they will likely never mature in terms of their worldviews and narratives, unlike the ‚Äúuneducated‚Äù public.

        I dunno, I was kind of thinking the opposite, at least when it comes to race.  For example, Amy Harmon of the NYT, recently denounced the great James Watson about his racial views, saying his views are widely discredited by experts, without providing any citations or footnotes.  You see that all the time, the thought that racial differences aren‚Äôt real and in fact, are so ridiculous we don‚Äôt need to provide proof.

        This is more evidence of the fact that leftists always project their flaws onto other people.  They call their opponents fascists who as we all know are unthinking, conformist robots.
In reality, blitzkrieg relied heavily on initiative on the part of noncoms and junior officers who understood the big picture in which their orders werere given.
This why they squealed like stuck pigs over the NPC meme.  They were forced to face their own flaws.

        I got a master‚Äôs in a stem field at the turn of the century and we went over a lot of the old papers that were seminal in my field. Some of them had taken decades of research to finally publish one paper but these papers were interesting and well-written and they actually had an effect on the field and the world. Now it‚Äôs publisher or perish. No one has time to do any research even if they had the inclination and if by some chance they had both no one has the courage.Side note.

        ‚Äúthe intellectual class reboots old ideas and repeats the same things over and over‚ÄùNot so, my friend; would that it were.In fact, a new idea of epochal importance has taken hold quite strongly, one might even say ovrrwhelmingly, among the intellectual and cultural classes.  And they never get tired of repeating it.  Roughly speaking, it is this:1.  White people have no right to exist.  Because slabery.  Because Holocaust.  Because the Slaveocaust.2.  White people‚Äôs countries, their lands, their women and all their stuff, rightfully belong to everybody else except White people.  Again, because Slaveocaust.  Or patriarchy.  Or something.3.  We should kill White people and take their lands and their stuff, and make their women our sex slaves.  As they say at Slate and HuffPo, ‚Äúand that‚Äôs a good thing.‚Äù4.  Once all the White people are gone, we can all get gay-married in our flying pyramids, worship Islam, and build infinity Holocaust Museums.  Kangz!

        I am currently pursuing a doctoral degree, so this topic is painfully real to me as I must read the current academic papers in my field (music) and adjacent subjects. Of course the citations are mainly a signal of your right-thinking (the ‚Äúwho‚Äù that you cite, and their status in the academic clownworld moral pantheon is more important than the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù of their actual theories and arguments), but what is particularly offensive to me is the recent prevalence of ‚Äúauto-ethnography‚Äù (didn‚Äôt David Carradine die from that?) ‚Äì auto-ethnography meaning ‚Äúshit I dreamed up out of my addled brain and misinterpreted personal experiences that can‚Äôt be verified, tested or challenged because I‚Äôm really too lazy to actually read and do real research‚Äù ‚Äì the Xirls seem to really love this method because it lets them put their well developed habit of making uninformed pronouncements on every subject to good use in career advancement.. Between the two approaches I spend most of my reading time vacillating between hysterical laughter and homicidal ideation.

        Excellent article, as usual! (You are a National Treasure, you know.)Anyway, reminds me a bit of what Oscar Wilde said: ‚ÄúThe difference between journalism and literature is that journalism is unreadable, and literature is not read.‚Äù Our ‚Äúintellectual‚Äù class writes mostly drivel‚Äìtrust me on that, as I have had 30 yrs experience editing their scribblings to make them (gag) publishable.‚Äù But all I can do, really, is to clean up the grammar and style. It really is almost exclusively drivel. And unreadable. And probably unread. Trust me on this too: Just because somebody cites somebody else does in no wise mean that the writer has actually read the cited source. Skimmed it, yes, probably, but only for outtakes to cite. And only‚Äìneed this even be said?‚Äìto back up whatever ‚Äúthesis‚Äù the writer wants to demonstrate.Teachers (and ‚Äújournalists‚Äù) are particularly dreadful. They (necessarily) have degrees in something called ‚Äúeducation,‚Äù but NEVER in the field that they (pretend to) teach. What they ‚Äúknow‚Äù is something called ‚Äúteaching methods.‚Äù They know LOTS of those, whatever they are. But the subject they are PAID (!) to ‚Äúteach,‚Äù no. Never. There‚Äôs a childlike (and childish) faith in ‚Äúexperts.‚ÄùWell, I‚Äôm getting wound up and beginning to ramble, so I‚Äôll stop now.

            My sister worked in the Danish department of energy, and one day the boss‚Äô nephew, fresh out of uni, got hired for some PR position. Nephew is tasked with writing a two-page synopsis on wind energy or something. Boss asks my sister to ‚Äòpolish up‚Äô his text, as he‚Äôs near-dyslectic.Sis takes a look at it, and discovers that it‚Äôs rank, utter nonsense. She discovers that he has copypasted from random articles on wind turbines and arbitrarily cobbled it together with no regard for any overall coherence or narrative in the text.She goes to nephew and tells him that the ministry will be a laughing stock if they issue random copypasta. He takes it back to the drawing board, comes back a week(!) later.Same thing. He is unable to compose a text in his own words, he is not even able to paraphrase his sources, because all he‚Äôs ever done at uni is copy from the internet. The man had a masters in public administration.

        Thanks for the flashback to grad school, Z Man.  One of my favorite private jokes was doing the citation tango by attributing the most banal statements imaginable to big league academics.  So I‚Äôd have Michel Foucault saying that power is ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù (Les mots et les choses ‚Äì une arch√©ologie des sciences humaines (Paris: Gallimard, 1966), p.45); Judith Butler maintaining that gender is ‚Äúimportant‚Äù (Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity. Routledge. p. 32), etc.  Nobody ever called me on it, no matter how silly it got ‚Äî proof positive, I guess, that nobody actually reads the stupid footnotes.

            Severian, you are right, who reads the stupid footnotes‚Äîunless you are disagreeing or confused wrt the passage(s) in the paper referencing the footnote?  I‚Äôm simply not getting the bulk of the concern here.  I have little problem reading through such papers/studies‚Äîskipping over the citations/footnotes and when necessary, reading the citations if I need too.  If you are adept in the field, the citations seem of little bother, and if not, then are of great necessity.

        The worst is when soft subjects, like literature, ape the citation-heavy style of research papers.
I remember reading some literature ‚Äúpapers‚Äù in college. It was just as awful as Xirl science.
But I had the good fortune of finding much older books at the library and at the second-hand bookstores, which was just ‚Äúsmart guys saying smart things about literature,‚Äù without any footnotes or systematic subversive programs, and it was an absolute joy.

        I work in scholarly publishing. There are several factors operating there. People cite their friends, bumping each other up in citation indexes. They cite their grad school profs. They cite academic stars that they want to suck up to. They‚Äôd probably rather not publish at all, but publishing is the only path to tenure (failure to attain tenure is career death), promotion, and the chance to move up the academic food chain (who wants to stay at Backwater State A&amp;M forever?).

        It all fits perfectly. All things are now known and all questions have been answered. So why do we still need these outmoded (and probably racist) concepts like inquiry and debate? The search for truth is over.The Cathedral has all the answers and your only task, grasshopper, is to learn to use the ‚Äúsearch‚Äù function. Act as if you have all the answers and the answers will be given to you. History consists of slavery, the Holocaust and Stonewall. What else do you need to know? Why, even to ask questions is, of itself, an act of insubordination. You must burn for this.

        Two things going on here, IMHO.  One is that citation is easy and a lazy way out, when you can Google the internet.  Two is that stupid people are mostly incapable of original thought, or of stringing disparate things together into new and useful insights, so they simply copy and paste.  And since the universities and corporations operate by co-opting all those stupid people into the fold, and having them do what they are told, there is no institutional incentive to do anything but perpetuate the practice.

        Conformity and an innate lack of wonder and curiosity have become commonplace in academia.   A not insignificant part of this is also due to the expansion of cargo-cult credentialism.  There are a lot of dumb, some of them very dumb, PhDs running around on campus these days.
Less than 2 generations ago 15% to 20% of graduating HS students went on to university.  Today it‚Äôs approaching 70%.
Add to that the sorts of people acting as gatekeepers the higher you go in the academy.

            The dumb PhD‚Äôs are the puzzler. I get weeding out the curious, but how can they not weed out the stupid. That just seems like basic elf-preservation, but I have not thought too hard about it. Of course, what exactly constitutes ‚Äúsmart‚Äù in queer studies? For that matter, what is ‚Äúsmart‚Äù in the humanities? At least in the STEM fields, they still require right answers, for now. Given the advent of diversity points on the SAT, I fully expect the same in the math department one day.

A rather prophetic typo.  It IS of course ‚Äúelf-preservation‚Äù insofar as the universities have become the havens of cute, puny little elves, who need to be guarded and protected and preserved in their Safe Spaces, lest they discover that the big bad Raciss ideas turn out to be actually true.

Either way, the STEM departments at universities will be an interesting area to watch. How will the SJW crowd diversify them without destroying them?

This is now typical in the manufacturing of black and brown scholars ‚Äì ghost written with a kabuki theater-like defense.That day has already arrived in STEM if you have a big enough department.

He‚Äôs a nonentity but was given tenure for his contributions to ‚Äòeducational opportunity ‚Äò.  Basically he whines all day at academic conferences about unfairness and exclusivity in math.  Every sizable department in STEM has at least one version of him. So do large research labs and industrial engineering firms.But I wouldn‚Äôt discount the grown in the number of students getting degrees.  Regression to the mean, etc‚Ä¶

                As I‚Äôve mentioned before, in the STEM fields, for example Engineering, one can create new degree areas such that one can get an engineering degree in ‚Äúengineering management‚Äù with minimal requirements for math and such.  That will produce the requisite ‚Äúdumb‚Äù graduates.  And of course, pressure on faculty to pass low achieving minorities or risk sanction are building.  And as you mentioned, there are now a variety of new degree areas in Ethnic studies and such for the worse of the worse.

            Yves, correct.  We need to get back to basics.  First basic, what is a 4 year college education about and for whom?  To major in a rigorous STEM field requires and IQ about 120 or so.  That‚Äôs 10% or so of the population.  OK, so there are folks attending over and above the 10%.  I‚Äôll not get too upset at the 15-20%‚Äîbut more than that, and the standards must inevitable decline.  And that‚Äôs what we have today‚Äîremedial high school education, if that‚Äîin our university system.  Waste of resource.

        The root cause is how promotions are decided has evolved badly.
Now it‚Äôs not did you move your field forward.  It‚Äôs how often you publish, which journals and conferences accept your papers, AND how often you are cited.
Citing everything is a form of pay it forward.

        With an education system based on Prussian credentialism, it‚Äôs no surprise we‚Äôre producing generations of brown-nosed metric-chasing grinders with little to no analytical or critical thinking skills (especially ironic in the age of crit theory). I‚Äôve seen this transform California law practice over 20+ years. Kids out of Harvard, Stanford et al can‚Äôt think on their feet.  They only excel at cheating, blame-shifting and, when forced, grinding out rote work product from samples their elder betters have provided.

            Citation: the ‚Äúblack lives matter, love trumps hate‚Äù yard signs affixed to the $800k homes in my bluetopolis. Its the ‚Äúok‚Äù sign that means ‚Äúgoodwhite‚Äù.
Its all rather self-congratulatory and likely feelz good as it requires no further thought.
But when the new LED street lights go dark or the sanctuary policies turn the streets dark, those signs (and indeed the prostrating tolerance of white guilt) will be even less useful than the ‚Äúblack owned‚Äù signs in the old LA riots. Good times.

        An exception to the above is the law profession.  Citation to authority is the lifeblood of it (at least in litigation), but its purpose is not to advance knowledge per se, but to convince a judge that X issue has already been decided a particular way, hopefully by another Court to which he owes deference.

        All of this has been coming at us for a long time. A long lost primary source was published in a journal not too long ago (I discovered it and wrote an introduction). The young editor and one of the readers made me add a lot of secondary sources to make it more acceptable. I thought a primary source by an important historical figure could stand on its own. Apparently not. For any who are interested, Page Smith‚Äôs 1990 book ‚ÄúKilling the Spirit,‚Äù subtitled ‚ÄúHigher Education in America,‚Äù reads like prophecy.  Note especially his chapters, ‚ÄúThe Social Nonsciences,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Inhuman Humanities,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs Studies.‚Äù It‚Äôs not like we weren‚Äôt warned.

        Another part of why citations may be so prolific is that they‚Äôre a way to mitigate criticism of your position. Get even ankle deep into a debate with someone, and as sure as Godwin‚Äôs Law is a thing, someone will inevitably ask:Where‚Äôs your source for that?Can you cite a source?Can you prove that, what study backs that up?Where did you get those numbers from?What proof do you have?Y‚Äôknow, everyone‚Äôs favorite: The Got‚Äôcha!But if you head that off by hitting them with a wall of citations, it makes your argument (in theory) harder to refute; and it makes you appear less likely to be making stuff up. Of course, they will then go after the source of your source and criticize that instead: you got that off such-and-such or from so-and-so, the study was racist, etc‚Ä¶

        I am intimately familiar with the selection for regurgitators.I majored in math, a field I did well in with high grades, but one I‚Äôd never be able to contribute new to. I have no ideas. I just like the rhythm of it.I minored in history. I had so many ideas that I tackled without reservation or thinking, bounding into research and putting together papers that even my professors admitted to admiring, but always awarded with low grades due to lack of citation. Well, the ideas I failed to cite were my own.One professor let me in on a secret ‚Äì you don‚Äôt get to think for yourself until you go for your PhD. Everything before that does its level best to push the thinkers out with poor grades and reward the regurgitators with high marks.

They show up later after the blood letting has been done to game/suck-up to the new rulers.And yeah they don‚Äôt have any original thoughts because you don‚Äôt need any to advance.

        The citation culture is a cross-product of litigation and origination.  Litigation, because if you cannot prove your idea is original, the person who thinks their idea was original will sue you.  Origination, because of the innate human desire to be thought of as the carrier of original ideas ‚Äì the guy who ‚Äúgets the credit‚Äù.It is almost never the case that ‚Äúyour‚Äù idea is genuinely unique or was never thought of before you came around.  It is often the case that the guy who published or monetized it successfully gets remembered as the person who thought of it.  That‚Äôs why we remember Edison more than Tesla.  Henry Ford more than Karl Benz.  Albert Einstein more than Hendrick Lorentz‚Ä¶even though the former often benefited from insights by the latter.I do think that citation culture stems from academia where, other than cheating, plagiarism is the greatest sin.  Teachers today employ a phalanx of anti-plag tools just in case a student dares write something without the proper attribution.  Then end result, of course, is that you QUICKLY learn that even your most clever/original/creative idea‚Ä¶has been thought of already.I actually feel bad for students today.  They can legitimately arrive at an observation or conclusion that they never once read or heard‚Ä¶but if they write it, they stand a good chance of being accused of theft.It‚Äôs like defensive medicine ‚Äì a procedure you perform not out of actual necessity, but simply to avoid being hurled into the void for having the temerity to notice something others have noticed too‚Ä¶

        ‚ÄúPromiscuous lack of curiosity‚Äù Why reading here is good for my health.The lack of curiosity is what drives a stake into my heart.I have some tolerance for the self-indulgence and unearned self-regard of generation regurgitation, as they were mostly good children merely navigating the wicked curriculum of Progress put before them. We got what we incentivized.But what tilts my axis toward the inevitable hard reset is how the utter lack of curiosity has seemingly enveloped nearly every aspect of human interaction.There is no doubt that technology and the fetish culture that insulates it from critical inquiry as to its utility net of actual costs plays a role.But the dovetail of tech and the prog social agenda seems to have exponentially increased the unforeseen consequences of dehumanization, social distancing, and hyper-individualization to a point where the remedy resides in the unthinkable.This over-socialization seems to have metastasized. I hope i‚Äôm wrong.But in my work with kids over the past 10 years I have seen the burnoff of the natural inclination toward curiosity accelerating.I used to see 10y/o kids full of wonder and questions and eager to figure things out. Less so these days. I have to go much younger to find that.The funnel of potential human thought has been narrowed drastically. Maybe even inverted.The bandwidth constraints of progress throttles early and often. So naturally we have a problem of trajectory.How can we expect to have curious deep thinkers filling the PhD ranks when we have 6y/o kids losing sleep over drowning polar bears; 10 y/o kids demanding accommodations (and getting them) for their behavior problems that are natural outcomes of abandonment and neglect falsely assuaged by shiny things; and high school kids anxious, depressed, and obsessed with the perfect parroting skills to get them into debt, I mean college. Where they go on to chase rape culture and nazi ghosts between revisionist history classes and identity political ‚Äúscience‚Äù.I once dated woman in an ‚Äòelite‚Äô masters program at the local uni here. All of her work was regurgitating (with citations) the four food groups of social engineering: race, sex, class, and power.She didnt even have to take statistics let alone any other math or actual history. Wtf? I had to get thru calc 2 and stats for my measly BA.Which brings me to the end. Selfishly, the lack of curiosity means that single women are even more unsuitable for courtship.Nay, the promiscuity of mind and body are united in this regard; there is a void that if not filled with truth will demand to be filled with something, anything, and so the fiat currencies of credentials and prog social status will trade on even while the heart longs for curiosity.A bit long winded, apologies.

        Sadly, she missed an opportunity to write ‚ÄúBolinger Bolshevik‚Äù. It is not original either, but it‚Äôs much less stale than ‚ÄúChampagne Socialist‚Äù. It would be very applicable to Jeremy Corbyn and his pals, if she ever wants to write about them.

        Uhhh‚Ä¶am I the only one that likes citations? When reading engineering papers it helps a lot to have other papers that cover some of the ideas in a paper. Some of these are complicated and require more reading to understand. Also if you like the paper reading more of the same is stimulating. If I don‚Äôt like it I can always skip reading the listed references.
I do get that some papers are just strung together references but you can always skim those and ignore the citations so I‚Äôm not losing anything if they cite them.

        Gonna have to disagree a little Z.  Academia is a hot mess to be sure, but it isn‚Äôt citation that did it.  Citation is the method by which people distinguish the existing body of knowledge from that which the author is intending to add.  Nothing inherently wrong with it, lot of good comes from it.What you‚Äôre calling ‚Äúcitation‚Äù in popular press isn‚Äôt that at all, it‚Äôs just signaling what team you‚Äôre on by naming  who is and isn‚Äôt a teammate.Since you mention the IDW, there is the occasional eye dropper of prog speaking against interest, but it‚Äôs mostly an exercise in self-congratulation.  I find my eyes involuntarily rolling at nearly every Bret Weinstein utterance.

        The academic rule is that every statement of fact must either have an experimental or theoretical derivation you, yourself, produce or an explicit citation of a published paper. Tht‚Äôs just the way it is. It is also a very good rule for good science. Stop whining about good practice.

                She‚Äôs trying to make a simple point based on observation of recent surprise election results in Australia, which is, as I understand it, that throughout the Anglosphere the parties of the working class have been captured by the educated upper class.
