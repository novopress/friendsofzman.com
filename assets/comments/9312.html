        I got introduced to this blog by a friend this summer and have been a regular reader ever since. I was doing a lot of driving from the Midwest to the Imperial City for work (I refuse to move there…) and began noticing the Trump Pence signs sprouting like mushrooms with only an odd HRC sign once I got east of Cumberland.Everyone I spoke with thought I was insane when I said in June he would win. Won some money too come 08 November too…Anyway I love the historical context and mocking the managerial elites driving this country into the ground. Thanks and have a great 2017.

            In or around September my sister and BIL were driving SB I-75 from Michigan to Florida when she texted me that all they saw in Ohio were Trump/Pence signs. I took it as a good omen….

        Congratulations, not just a mention but right up front and center!Is it just me, or are many of the sites sort of falling away into some sort of irrelevancy?  Even Drudge and ZH, while they still grab me now and then, seem to have become less compelling to visit.My personal “big five” are Z, American Digest, Woodpile Report, Conservative Treehouse, and Instapundit.  And Z is the only one of the five where I read every comment of every posting and think carefully about what has been written.  You seem to have captured “lightning in a bottle” here.  I think it is just one of those things that happens now and again, and I am enjoying the trip while it lasts.  Again, congratulations and Happy New Year.

        Congratulations. Also, thank you for interacting with the commenters. I don’t read too many other Blogs (so I don’t know if it’s rare or not) but your active involvement in the comment stream is evidence that you respect your readers and are interested in and stimulated by what they have to say.

        Van der Leun pointed me here.  Your blog really has become the theoretical center of the “movement,” such that it is.
I have started reading Sailer and need to look at Conservative Treehouse more.

                I believe so. I check AD almost daily and found your blog when you were just starting. AG has been a font for other great stuff, like Kaching and now sadly defunct Happy Acres.

                        Fabulous news. His simple blog–very very simple–packed the greatest punch from the gentlest soul we shall see. I suspect that it was his kindness that killed them at tumblr. I linked his images to many, but especially to educate, or re-educate, my own kids. What is seen cannot be unseen.
Also, thanks to Gerard for Zman and many others.

            I found this blog through American Digest and it has been a daily read from those days, if not even earlier. One lazy day, I read each and every post since blog’s inception to the date I had it bookmarked.

        Congrats Z Man;
Found your blog via Instapundit last fall (Why is he not on the list_?).  I really appreciate (and share with less ability) your appreciation for historical knowledge and deep skepticism regards current power and money arrangements: I might as well say wisdom.

        Don’t like at least half the winners over at Doug’s.  won’t be going back or reading him.  For me, a person’s reaction to Trump is an excellent predictor of their worthwhileness.  And Mr Ross has a lot of anti-Trumpers in his awards.

        Doug’s site went into the crapper last year for his endless links to stories that were intent on taking Trump out and aking Cruz the nominee. Hey it’s his site and he can do anything with it he wants but all I repeatedly asked for was a little more balance. Yaknow something better then 12-1 or 12-0.
Anyway Z congrats on your success. I like your reporting from the bowels of DC

        The thing is — and this makes me a little sad — this blog will not be improved by all the new attention.  Once it becomes monetarily valuable, as it will this year, it will become “safer”.   C’est le guerre 🙂  Look at poor Belmont Club for an example of what I am talking about.

        I’ll add to the congrats! I greatly enjoy your writing and choice of topics and truly admire your energy, something I find myself lacking as the years pass. Thanks, too, for the tips! Bad Blue at first glance beats Breitbart; the latter has “exclusives” from Jackie Mason (!) and a link to Cindy Adams(!!), both of whom I remember from the 50s along with Jerry Lewis and didn’t like then. Some folks never know when to say die, I guess.
Looking forward to more years of reading your work. Happy and Prosperous New Year!

        Mr Zman I believe you serve the Kudos because your efforts have positive effects on others. Your way of expressing insights and viewpoints enables people to identify with what your writing about, and by wonderful and positive consequence, bring people together, help others find common ground and a sense of solidarity. There is everything to be said for this and your work.I think it is safe to say in this world today, that is a great thing. Bring people together.The key to successful anti agenda politics and anti propaganda, to creating a healthy rational alternative to the narrative as means:Tell the truth, and help people to see it as such. I think you do that splendidly Mr Zman.

        Sincere congratulations and thanks to Zman, and thanks to the many thoughtful commentators on this site.
I would urge everyone to take appropriate precautions to maintain your anonymity in 2017. Given the drubbing the political left took in 2016 I expect a major doxxing push from the left. Just visiting a blog like this one could be hazardous to your career, and anything you write in the comments can and will be used against you.
