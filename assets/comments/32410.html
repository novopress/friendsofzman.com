        I think a lot of us have given up on the country.  Unfortunately it will probably take a complete economic collapse or nuclear war to break the imperial government.  I’d be fine if we disintegrated into the states or city states and the rest of the country.

            That’s already happening if my life is an indication of a larger trend, and by nature it probably is since if you can poll 1000 people to find out how 1 million think — on certain issues — then stands to reason that my life experience is similar to that of many other people.The break from the imperial government is mostly psychological or sort of forgetting about it like an old girlfriend.  And that’s basically what it is, an old flame.  because we all used to love her.We are basically in a similar situation as the blacks, in a sense at least, where the government goes on running and spinning like a merry-go-round but we just ignore it and keep walking thinking “Ain’t my people, ain’t my problems” and do our own thing.  Again, I am seeing that more and more, at least, among the people I know.

                Spot on. It is time to get past the bitterness and remembrance and embrace what comes next. I’m seeing it as well.

                    Whether you love or hate Trump that is one massive reason to be eternally grateful to him: his election in 2016 tore off the mask of the Deep State for all who have eyes to see. Before then, even a master cynic like me never realized how truly evil they are. Now we have to destroy them.

                        Yes, 2016 was a watershed year. Without Trump winning then, imagine the accelerated damage that the Democrats would have accomplished by now. And I’m not an accelerationist. Trump deserves eternal thanks for what he has done. And yes, I recognize that he’s far from perfect. But he tore that mask off, as you said, and anyone with a bit of sense should be horrified by what’s underneath.For me, the aftermath of the 2014 election was when my eyes opened wide to the corruption of the GOP bigshots like McConnell and Ryan. I should have understood earlier, but sometimes it takes a lot of effort to drag one’s self from comforting illusions. It’s a lot harder for me to accept any excuses as valid since 2016, though.Just as a very minor example, I’ll never forget how George W. Bush made some disparaging remark about Trump’s inauguration speech, that “That was some weird shit,” or something along those lines.

                the government goes on running and spinning like a merry-go-round but we just ignore it and keep walking thinking “Ain’t my people, ain’t my problems” and do our own thing
This is good advice. People are black-pilling, but I think modern Americans are spoiled in a sense. We no longer have the ability to control or even participate in our own government, but this new state for us is really the norm for all of human history, and self-representation merely a historical abnormality. Lives were lived, business formed, and families raised for centuries before the novel concept of suffrage.

                    People are blackpilling for sure.  I was laughing to myself, saying “You know, you used to think you’d have to travel to some event in another state to meet people who think like you.  But now they are everywhere, so I can stay home, and save money”.Which means we succeeded, the DR succeeded.  We got enough people to break out of the box and see things for what they are.  We provided a service of illuminating the trail along the river of the great divide.I sense however a new storm is coming, my hurricane intuitions, and the themes herein and regularly discussed in these circles will soon be out of date.  New challenges lie ahead.  But it should be understood that merely providing light to lost travelers is probably the best we can do as a group.  That is a lot however.  Wrangling millions of people over to the side of the river is good enough.  They’re close by, and it should be taken as a big win.  Not the Super Bowl.  But we did make the first round of the playoffs after going 0-16 in 2012 and then 8-8 in 2016.  Given the new format, I’d say we hit the 10-7 mark and got in as a wildcard.I will take that any day of the week.  But again, a new storm is coming.

                    Yep. Reading history is a grim experience but it’s often easy to forget that millions (billions, even) of ordinary people lived happy lives while bad things were happening around them. The greatest power we have as individuals is live the kind of life that evil SoBs like Gates, Soros and every leftie hate.

                As someone who is in blue states often with middle-aged men who consider themselves to be “right-wing conservatives,” I must advise that you ensure that no Republicans from the coasts is ever allowed into your sphere. These guys were delighted with the Republican National Convention and are overjoyed at the thought of voting for the losing Republican candidate because he isn’t racist, “like the Dems are.” They are pro-immigrant (“Work harder than the kids”) and pro-gay (“nunna muh business, just keep it out of my face,” they’ve been saying since 1992).I closed the book on the US on July 13th. I’m done. I feel like a piece of walking indifference now. Covid was the end, but the next few months will push me out to sea, perhaps literally.

                    If you’re already mentally receptive,  investigate expatriation.  I’ve already got a piece of ground on another shore to the south, and every time I go to visit it I feel like I went back in time to 80’s America.  A time when I had the illusion of freedom and some optimism for the future.  Yeah, lots of browner folk there, but their system is simple enough to suit them, violence is minimal because the cops don’t protect criminals, and race realism is a given among them.  Also, plenty of right wing expats to hang out with.

                        There is a surprising correlation between the wealth of a nation and the extent of its tyranny.  I guess I can see the reason, if you’re poor you are no threat, but if you are middle class or upper middle then you might become a problem and thus require extra buttons on your straightjacket.And just a small anecdote.  I was in Rome and went into a shop to buy a beer.  Before leaving I asked the guy for a brown bag.  He asked why.  I said to put the beer in to hide it.  He scoffed at me and brushed aside my concern.  “It’s a beautiful day, you are out walking with a beer, why would anyone bother you about that?”I know freedom is a bigger concept than just being able to walk around in public with a beer, but for most people these are the things that make you feel free.  In short, freedom means to be treated like an adult who can make his own informed decisions.  America instead treats everyone like children, hence the extra-strength nagging we get all day.

                            Interesting.  I had the misfortune to have to return to NYC for a visit in the bad old, pre Giuliani days of Mayor Dinkins (early 90’s).  He was the first Black mayor to screw things up.
First thing I saw in a walk through the old neighborhood was Blacks with their “unpackaged” 40’s walking around screaming at each other in the commercial area.  I then witnessed a finished 40 ouncer being tossed into the gutter where it shattered.  I knew I was traversing a cesspool of humanity that knew no bottom.

In fact, having lived most of my life in the Washington D.C. suburbs, many of those neighborhoods have gone from middle-class affordable (we are talking the Johnson Administration here, folks) to nowadays if not into the seven digits, within spitting distance.On the other hand, many times I’ve had the experience of visiting urban* hellscapes and at least at times, realizing to myself that hey, once upon a time, not that long ago, this was a functional area with mostly White people living here.*Of places I’d seen repeatedly, my personal “worst” are Baltimore and the darker parts of DC, in that order.

When in Rome, do as the Romans do… leave the American neurotics and police state mentality at the terminal.

                        Central and Eastern Europe are like this and parts of Southern Europe as well. It immediately feels like you stepped out of a time machine I 100% understand your take here.The real benefit of those parts of Europe however is that unlike your based beaner bros in South America, I am surrounded by my genetic cousins and it is a sea of Europeans. I agree about South America being very “out of time” too but the stark reality is that it is goblinas and mud people. You could stay in the States and within a few decades they will be indistinguishable. We are half way there right now with a sub 50 percent White population.

                        I share your goals. I was interested enough (in my mid-40s) to make several trips to Latin America scouting out various retirement havens (Mexico, Panama) but decided it wasn’t for me — at least not yet. I have more than a passing knowledge of the topic, having traveled widely, studied the language and culture and even lived there (admittedly not as adult in modern times). While there are many upsides, some of which you cite, alas there are many pitfalls as well. Not the least of these is as someone observed, “They are called third-world nations for a reason.” As much as we bemoan the erosion of institutions here in America, the awful truth is that in much of the world the “rule of law” is rather absent. As some author said, even in seeming nice places like Argentina, your property rights can change with the next gust of wind. This doesn’t mean that they cannot be decent places to live, even for expats, but you’re a fool if you expect standards like used to be back home.Pro tip: If you have a lot of compatriots in your foreign bolt hole, you are probably paying more than market rates for the privelege.

                    Arthur, when I lived in coastal CA, I came to think of the people you mention as liberals who want low taxes as well. They like most of the Democrat’s policies, they just think that it could be done with less taxes.I have one memory of when Obama planned to replace Jackson on the $20 with Harriet Tubman. Although at that time our statues had not been overturned yet, this change was the currency equivalent of that.The white Republican sales director of my company said with enthusiam, “Yes!

            I don’t see much unfortunate about that at this stage. As Z said, the Old America is not coming back. It doesn’t matter who “wins” in November because the only cure is some kind of break up or separation. It will be messy and almost certainly involve bloodshed, but I see no alternative.

I mean we might as well have a biker club or be like Comanches but do you wanna sell meth and shit in the woods? Sure the old world is gone, but war, war never changes : ). I think infiltration and sabotage is necessary, even to just blow off some steam but nothing is really stopping you from finding where these parasites live and, u know rearrange their vascular blood flow. The alternative is, as you said wait for your turn at the gallows.. sad place and time we find ourselves in, but if they have no issue laughing at ur people being raped and tortured, then why bother with any morals.. Serve us thy vicious desires!

            I watched a docudrama on the Baader Meinhoff Gang (RAF) the other night.  They came to your conclusions also, and proceeded to shit all over the place instead of just the woods.

            Take heart my man. Things are looking up. There are a lot more like-minded right-wingers now than there ever were. Cancellations have not stopped us. The Eye of Sauron Media is still looking for white racists, for sure, but from my personal experience fewer and fewer people care about perceived racism, more and more people have the scales falling from their eyes, and nationalism – civic or otherwise – will almost certainly take over what we call the Right.At best the leftists winning in Western Europe and the US will only accelerate their demise; at worst this will Balkanize the West and you’re going to have a permanent population of right-wingers who don’t trust and don’t associate with their regimes and their supporters.Remember a few years ago when the big debate was whether to infiltrate the Republican party or detach and form our own networks? I think the time is ripe to infiltrate Republican networks. You don’t need to be a supporter of Democracy or voting. We need IRL groups, and how many Twitter racists live in your area? Probably very few, but many younger Republican types that don’t hate you because you follow Patrick Casey. That’s your demographic. Assuming you want political associates IRL. They won’t be cancelled, either, because they aren’t as racist or sexist as you…but there are a few Auron MacIntyres waiting for your red pills.

                Indeed, the tides are shifting but the past 8 years have shown me a lot about IRL groups. I was naive during the covid scam, thinking now they have to see what’s happening, they have no choice but to be on our side of the divide but for very obvious reasons, no one wants to sacrifice their relationships and reputation in the liberal social circles that dominate their status and wealth. I guess my true struggle is with my heart’s desire to live in harmony with our people, but knowing only an iron fist would ever make a change in the right direction. I think what Z-man said about showing yourself from a position of strength is all that one must strive to do. Our ancestors will await us at the gates of Heaven with proud smiles and strong arms…

        There is another significant psychological barrier that is tied into this: the situation is the way it is because the regime wants it to be this way. The day-to-day problems in, for example, cities are pretty easy problems to solve. They’ve been solved before. A relatively small handful of people in these cities commit a ludicrously outsized proportion of the crimes both big and small, and the police know who these people are. They can be locked up and the city can be made better for all the normal people. The government leaders just won’t do it, and by not doing it, they’re making clear that they desire the negative effects to come. As a normal person, then, you realize that they aren’t interested in helping you out or making your life better and simpler – quite the opposite.This is a tough thing to come to grips with – the people we ostensibly choose to lead us in our sacred democracy actually hate us. Judging by the RNC, I don’t think that a lot of people fully get it.

            The right are stronger devotees of “word magic” than the usual suspects are.Call the state a necessary evil—and magically it’snotevil, nobody in it is an evildoer, and nothing evil it accomplishes is intended by it or anyone in it. Egregious current example: As the number of badges involved in Trump’s shooting has multiplied, interest in the event has disappeared.Libertarianism (American) consists ofsayingthat all institutions should behave differently than any of them actually do, and when none of them obey the Laws you made up, saying that theymust be, we must just be misunderstanding them, and rationalizing every actual Human Action away.“Oh they’ll regret setting this precedent!” They won’t. Laws are words. They’re free to ignore them. You aren’t. You believe in spells. They believe in hurting you.The only prominent /ourguy/ who’s really put a foot through this mirror is Gregory Hood. He repeats (because he has to): Our enemiesareour enemies. What they control isas they want it. If it “worked” they wouldn’t do it. Etc. He’d probably side with them if they weren’t ugly and gay—he’s a “natural conservative” like that—but he’s made that first, necessary, impossible-seeming step, and he hasn’t stepped back from it.There’s a talking point going around right now, from the now-usual suspects, that to go on being “black pilled” now that Thiel (metonymic “Thiel”) seems to control Trump is to shirk one’s manly duty, that failure to submit to the marginally different New Boss is cowardice. Bravery is surrender! Just pretend you’re surrendering to yourself. “We’rewinning! What are you, aloser?!”Or—don’t step back. See. Then what? Then what.

        We cannot organize and network, for two reasons: (1) the power against us will hunt down all “grassroots” organizing, then infiltrate and annihilate; (2) there is no “we”. Proof? Look at the comment threads on this blog.What we can do is to be underground shitlords. Take me, for instance. I have no Trump sign in my yard, I haven’t flown the Stars &amp; Stripes since Autumn 2012 (Lawrence Auster: “It’s their country now.” I agreed and still do.) I’m a small-time painting contractor. So what can I do? Well, over forty years I have learned how to identify leftoid clients (in fairness, they often make it easy, what with their virtue-signalling signs and all). As a man of honesty and integrity, I won’t cheat them on service, but I do apply a “lefty surcharge”, between 20-40%, based on (a) if it is an attractive job, but also (b) if the “asshole Geiger counter” jumps into spastic mode. I make these fuckers pay. After all, it’s not like they’ll do it themselves, and, foreigners and blacks make them nervous.

            Those are rookie numbers.(Just busting your balls)
I bid a job when Trump was running the first time, and these two goofs had a sign for his opponent that was as wide as their front yard.
Porch and deck, demo and rebuild.
I figured the cost and then doubled it.
I didn’t think I would get it, but what do you know, a month later, they called and said no one came out after me to bid.
The entire job paid for a new rig I was looking at.
I wonder how much I left on the table.

            It is interesting to learn that in your private life, you conduct yourself no better than a common brigand. I would not have assumed as much; I thought better of you than that.But it is even more interesting to learn that, in practice, you believe not one word ever said in these pages about “white tribal identity,” for in choosing to cheat your fellow white people in this manner, you have demonstrated that the primary object of your loyalty is politics and ideology,notskin color. This undercuts any basis you might have had for supporting white tribalism, both in theory and in fact.Not that I would condemn you for that. I have never endorsed white tribalism, and I have always said that tribalism based on ethnicity does not really exist, anyway (the primary victims of black criminality, for example, are other blacks). But the majority of the most vocal commenters heredoendorse white tribalism. Your behavior demonstrates that you do not do so consistently, and neither do those who have upvoted your comment. Now, let’s see how many of the others write back to defend it.A comment such as this pretty much means that this entire blog has jumped the shark. There is no logical coherence in its key propositions, as I have been trying to point out all along. I don’t doubt you will carry on, but from now on you will simply be diving further down the rabbit hole. You have left the path of wisdom, and any honest person can now satisfy himself on that point, using your own words. The mystery is over.

                Then I heard another voice from heaven say: “Come out of her, my people, … for her sins are piled up to heaven, … Give back to her as she has given; pay her back double for what she has done. Pour her a double portion from her own cup. Give her as much torment and grief as the glory and luxury she gave herself.”Revelation 18:4 – 7The mystery is that your intelligence does not have the resolution to differentiate hostile, foreign tribes or the need to have an expanded set of principles for dealing with them. War ethics is not esoteric knowledge, so a fair assumption is that you also have grave moral failings that do not allow you to have them.Even for those trying to cling to a generic and deracinated “white” identity, they typically allow the instinctive knowledge that some pale skins are not their tribe and are fundamentally hostile to them and their progeny.

                    No, he’s sacrificing White votes to pander to blacks. Maybe this made some sense when they thought they were going to run against Biden’s corpse and could sense a massive new coalition in play, but with Kamala Harris, there is *no* chance, no matter how many platinum plans, no matter HBCU funding, no matter how many degenerate rappers Trump pardoned in 2021.This election will come down to White voters in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. White voters want to hear about the issues that got him into office in 2016 not about letting criminals out of jail. Yet, the GOP, and this has been the case for decades, would rather lose an election than pander to White people. Trump seems to have adopted this behavior.

                        There is much in what you say. White people vote, but the GOP is sick with fear that someone will catch them noticing.That said, I think Trump is the only GOP candidate since Nixon who, albeit covertly, appeals specifically to white people. Border control is certainly a white issue. Export of middle class jobs is certainly a white issue and he’s raised those issues in a way no other serious candidate has. Just because he says nice stuff to black people doesn’t automatically mean he isn’t pro-white.Yeah, he wouldn’t get anything done on those issues, but Zman makes it pretty clear that nobody else ever will either in the present situation.Nonetheless, I hope Trump wins. Not that I expect it’s possible for him to fix anything, but he might drive the Regime crazier than it already is and hasten its downfall.

                            Trump was not covert about it in 2016. He really was quite overt about it, which is why he won the states he did. Yet he isn’t covert about it in 2024. Yea, he says he will tighten the border – great. But he also says that he will staple green cards to diplomas. We all know who will be coming here to get fraudulent 2-year degrees to get that green card, look to the north to see. That is going to result in both mass immigration AND a decimation of middle and upper-middle class jobs.I’m so disillusioned with Trump now. His RNC speech was so bad, the RNC was so bad. His campaign is run by cucks. They explicitly talked about scaring away White voters (“Karens”, what a mean leftist slur that the GOP has adopted) and bringing in the multiracial coalition (“Enriques and Jamals”). Now that it is obvious that’s not happening, they’re… Still pretending it will. It’s so bad.Despite the fact that the White population is declining, it is a simple fact that you can win elections for a long, long, long time by simply focusing on White people. If the GOP cared about White GOTV efforts as the Dems did for blacks, they would win every election. Whites are still ~60% of the vote, blacks are maybe 15%. It’s simple math. The fact that they don’t is a CONSCIOUS decision, it’s a CONSCIOUS decision to be a bunch of losers because they don’t want lefties to call them mean names.I know this is going to sound accelerationist, and maybe it is, but I think the Biden administration has driven the regime crazier than anything Trump could have done since 2020. They are so stupid, incompetent, mean-spirited, and out of control these days that they can’t help themselves. The existence of Trump is like a unifying thing that keeps them focused. But hand them power and they go nuts. This isn’t even the regime of Obama. A Kamala administration would be twice as bad as the Biden administration in any way you want to slice that.

                                I was never “illusioned” by him. One person can’t beat the entire Regime deep state establishment and it’s a mystery  to me why anyone thought he could. What he does is expose how the system works and drive the rulers nuts as he does so. A lot of people have been smartened up. What they do with what they’ve learned remains to be seen.

                                    Right, and I am telling you that you are describing a different guy from the one running right now. The guy you are describing was the guy in 2016 and, largely, 2020. Trump is running right now as Bob Dole or John McCain. He’s not exposing anything. He’s running as a standard GOP politician willing to play ball with the existing powers and send White kids to their death for Israel. He’s not driving anyone nuts except the most idiotic, partisan MSNBC-tier shitlibs, the ones who say every Republican politician is moustache man.Some people might say this is just an op, this is just a way to win office, once he gets in he will be our guy. I say that is cope, first and foremost because it’s not the way to win office, second every move he’s made this cycle indicates that he has acquiesced to the GOP’s power structure instead of bending it to his will as he did before.

Stupid Republicans say, “but that only works if the result is close.” Bullshit!

                Yeah, this whole Lee Greenwood bit has to die. The RNC was offensive, to say the least, in its passive-aggressive “deafness” to the actually-existing situation. BOM went along with it. You would think that after the last four years that a true opposition party would ball up and state hard facts, and demand hard justice: For the political prisoners of J6, for the millions of inmivaders now scattered across the fruited plain, for the miscreants that run our TLAs, for the monsters who imposed “vaccine” directives against both adults and children, for all the Soros-funded DAs who gladly release violent “vibrants” back to the ‘hood.If DJT REALLY wanted to fuck with our enemies, he’d just flat out say, “Yes, I am Hitler reborn, I want to end democracy, and I want to establish a dictatorship; then I intend to imprison or otherwise destroy my enemies. I intend to enthrone myself on a mountain of skulls, and rule as a god on Earth.”But he’d only be confirming what everyone knows from watching MSNBC. They’d be like, OMG, he’s literally Hitler, OK, you mean the same guy you’ve been describing for eight years?No! No! It’s like we are totally serious now!

        Amen. Amen. Amen. This was your best.The bottom line is, as you rightly pointed out, that the system is beyond reform now. Rules and laws and elections are for dummies unless they are part of the Regime and use them as weapons. Opt out, check out. If you bother at all to vote, the only reason to do so is to force blatant cheating. I worried a bit when you initially referred to “organizing,” because that raises the question of “for what?” Then you answered that question with “for what comes next,” which is the only way to view things.People are geographically sorting. Your encouragement for them to continue to do is spot on. While you are correct in your assessment of the Vdare situation, there is an element left unsaid. Despite the incredible wealth disparity, West Virginia also has tools that could make Leticia James’ life miserable, too. West Virginia chose not to use them to protect Vdare because the state remains part of the failed system and chooses to continue in that way. The day is on the horizon when a state or locality uses those tools due to the aforementioned sorting. It won’t be pretty but we are close.No one said it better:“When people see a strong horse and a weak horse, by nature they will like the strong horse.”The strong horse takes from the system and gives it nothing. The weak horse pretends the system is still a thing.Be the strong horse.

        VDARE’s first and fatal mistake was being associated in any way with a communist State, no doubt because they thought it was the NY they grew up with…Trump made the same mistake, but he had lived there all his life and palled around with the Clintons, which was more understandable…..

            To be fair to VDARE, New York’s descent into lawlessness is relatively new. Bloomberg ran New York City as a center-ish technocrat for 12 years, keeping Giuliani’s pro-normal people policies and improving governance in various ways. It wasn’t until DeBlasio got in in 2014 that it started going nuts and being taken over by idiot activists. On the state level, it was basically a center-left government until this massive activist left shift started when James took over AG in 2018 and then completed the coup against Cuomo in 2021. So it really only started to shift in the past decade. Now, it’s turning into California, but then California turned into California pretty quickly too. Maybe VDARE should have seen the writing on the wall – fair. But this is one of those things that you don’t really see happening until it happens. It’s why these lefty movements always end up eating their own after they are done with the right.

            It’s really hard to believe that within living memory (ok, the memory of somebody who’sreallyold) that in New York (and many other States):The only grounds for divorce were adultery, with evidence (witnesses);If a gang of bank robbers robbed a bank and the guard or a bystander was shot and died, every criminal involved in the crime, including the guy behind the wheel in the getaway car, was convinced of a capital crime and probably went to the electric chair pretty quick.Etc.Granted this was three or four generations ago, but it only goes to show that our morals and legal system have changed quite dramatically, and perhaps not always for the better.

        Your advice about relocating is spot on.  Get out of the blue hellholes and go someplace comparatively sane.  It will free up a whole lot of your energy to not have to worry about street crime, bums, open air drug markets, troon school teachers, shoplifting flash mobs, car jackings, etc.  Building community IRL works wonders for morale and has practical benefits, like the opportunity to share resources and talents.

            At some juncture you need to stand and fight. We weren’t able to have a family despite my wife is pretty and we’re both naturally blonde haired and blue eyed. Estrogenic cancers since fiance through 2019, the last mere a 9cm column of boob. Childless life in a smaller community would amont to slow death. So she reloads and I shoot until a breach and then I hope she can squeeze a trigger. She’s a tested good shot but there is no confidence she can neutralize the flesh target. Nobody since I was a kid and boxed and wrestled early would doubt my killer instinct as taught by my dad and grand dad. So, we’ll fight best we can manage. Unless escape is possible, the we have Plan B.

        Great show today.I can relate to your point about people still believing in the court system and the institutions of the old country.  I have a conservatard friend who constantly brings up things like “sue them into oblivion and that will stop them”, or “get white people to petition the courts and x or y will stop”.  I can’t even tell you how irritating this is. You cannot get people to understand that all of our institutions have been permanently destroyed.  There is no way to ever get them back.“Take back our country!”.  Bullshit – you are taking nothing back.  In fact, it will only continue to get even worse.  Barring the one thing that we cannot speak of, there will be no saving ‘Murica.  Even collapse won’t save it.  The future of civilization is brown retards.  This is not black pilling, this is facing reality.Organizing and creating tribes based on our people is a path forward, but we are a long, long way off before people really begin to do those things.  There are still too many things to lose before it gets there – and not a single person who reads this blog will live to see that, I don’t care how young you are.Z also hits the nail on the head regarding “availability”.  Rushing off and being a martyr will do nothing for the cause.  You will be memory holed and able to do nothing.  We still have obligations to take care of our children, loved ones and whomever depends on us.  Rotting in a jail cell does not enable one to do any of those things.The best quality of life is to remove yourself from the system, live in areas with other White people who share your values, create community.  Have a plan to tribe up in some way – build up wealth to create a “compound” of our people. Separate from the leftists and have the courage to offer them no quarter in even the most dire situations.  Never help them.

            Of course, the “Thing of which we cannot speak” is ultimately the final answer. I’ve accumulated a pretty good stockpile of “unmentionables” which will probably never see the “light of day” until long after I’m gone (I’m 73 years old). I’m hoping these tools will be passed down and eventually end up in the hands of some future white guy who finally commits to do what will be necessary to ensure a future for his children. However, I’m pretty sure my treasure trove will end up in a pawnshop to finance some more tattoos and video games.

Excellent insight. And those who will tribe up in the future will likely dig up the graves of us all (those who aren’t shipped to a crematorium by our kids, that is) and curse us for what we had and gave away out of guilt.

        Off topic, but interesting jobs report today. Along with the usual downward revisions, it’s the first bad jobs report in years. I’ve long thought that if Trump got in the White House again, they would just start telling the truth instead of using the fake Soviet boot production numbers we’ve been getting. I still think that’s true, but it is also interesting that the first post-Biden report is negative.

            You’re correct. The metadata here is very interesting. If the financial powers had wanted to rig the election for Kamala, they would have washed this report. My conclusion is, she isn’t going to win. She may not even run.

                I’ll keep your prediction in mind, but the fact seems she is running *now*—at least from the point of commercials and campaign stops.  Last commercial I saw even had her discussing her candidacy, as in ‘Hi, I’m Kamala and running for President…’Seems a change now, short of her death, would reveal a very bad aspect of her party and any other candidate selected in an open primary might lose as much of the base as would gain.  No, I suspect the Dem’s will settle for good old election balloting shenanigans to attempt to get her to the finish line.  There really are not that many States needed, and those States turn out to be the same ones screwed with last election.

                    What a busy few weeks it’s been for the Democrats. First Biden’s very odd stepping-down communiqué and edited video/audio appearance several days later to prove he wasn’t really dead. Now (August 1, I think) a virtual convention (online) unanimously chooses Harris as the candidate. And the real convention isn’t for another three weeks, nearly. Very weird things going on, no?

            Trump was on Michael Savage’s show in fall 2016 — and many others — talking about “the real unemployment rate” being somewhere around 12 or 13%, or even higher. My memory tells me Trump said “19%” at one point.
A year later he had miraculously gotten it down to low single digits and there was no more talk of the real unemployment rate.

                Yeah.  Unemployment rates as stated can be pretty deceptive.  There are a couple of other numbers generated.  One is “able bodied, but not looking for work”.  All need to be looked at to get a true picture of the situation.
The problem is basically that most Americans are too damn ignorant to look past “official” pronouncements from government and their propagandists, the MSM.

We need to focus on an element of thought that is critical to guerilla and dissident thought too – cheerfulness in the face of adversity. Some elements of classical stoicism, perhaps.

The desire for this is a moral failing and disease of the Right.

It is one of the sickest and most disgusting aspects of the cuckservatives.

If you don’t have a wife and family, if you are of an age where you can, under 45, then put one together. get your faith life correct. The course is set. Guys like fuentes and kirk are ARE losers. they have no families, they will have no future. what a wast of their lives.  make real friends and spend time with them . prepare to protect yourself and famalies from random violence .think of yourself as living in 1940’s ussr. you don’t have to be part of the system, but you have to live in the system .

        Excellent show.  From my perspective, the churches are the natural and proper organizing mechanism for our fight, but the contemporary church is more “Judeo-Christian” than Christian and ends up fighting for the Jews and their causes, including mass migration and debauchery.  The rainbow flag in from of many churches is evidence of this.  Even so-called “Biblical” Christians like the Speaker of the House Johnson are completely sold out to the antichrist Jews who have explicitly lobbied for the death of the White race. (See Noel Ignatiev, statements by former ADL president, etc)

            Churches are part of the problem. It’s interesting that Jesus only mentioned the word “church” (Ekklesia) twice, and even then he never meant a building with preacher-man and a 501c.

                I’ve nothing against a property that isn’t taxed by the regime. Also, there are other important elements baked into churches you haven’t mentioned:1 the early churches were mostly underground, so the Bible is rich in lessons for those of us who have little say in the politics of our country,2 putting the word “Christian” on a sign in front of your building tends to repel entry by most of the types who rule over us (especially Jews), and3 just about every town has an empty church that can be had for as little as $50,000 (in pretty good repair).

            The importance of churches in the U.S. is they may grant us legal protections for our organizations that the courts’ extra-legal abolition of free association has denied us. Not that this is any long-term guarantee in a lawless age, but like the 1st and 2nd Amendments we need to exercise whatever rights and privileges that are available to us.

                    You’re assuming they’d be about politics, Jeffrey. Churches for our guys should be overtly nonpolitical. But at least you should be able to have a men’s group without women suing to get their noses in the door, a women’s group that isn’t all about hating men, or a Sunday school—maybe even a parochial school—where your kids/grandkids aren’t hunted down on the playground like prey animals by packs of ferals.

        Off-topic, but deals with the theme of lamentation of a dead nation: Due to unforeseen events, a planned short vacation had to be cancelled. Instead, I took my youngest on the motorcycle to the Black Hills for a couple days, right before Sturgis started, just to get out of town before school resumes. I have no desire for crowds, and I am certainly not a biker type, but this was the most viable, short-term option (literally, one day notice).Even though Sturgis had not officially started, the Black Hill cities were packed with bikers. As I pointed out to my daughter, this is the nation that has been stolen from her. Even though there were thousands of people, most drinking, we did not feel unsafe in any way. Don’t misunderstand: I know many are involved in drugs and violence. But the general feeling was completely safe. If something bad were to happen, I have no doubt dozens would step in and put a stop to it immediately.That is what happens when there are thousands of whites, I pointed out to my little one. Even the rougher elements, in a group, are generally peaceful and orderly in public areas. Contrast this to a diverse gathering like Black Biker Week, or even a gathering of diversity. When we were in Rapid City on our way, stopped for coffee, a group of four South Americans were walking by and eyeing us. I stared back, ready to fuck up any fool messing with my girl, but this stood out to me in hindsight even more. The vision of a white gathering, peaceful, supplanted by an equivalent crowd of diversity, marauding, disgusted me.This is what was stolen from my darling. And the inability to publicly declare this loss makes the situation even more horrendous. I don’t care for VDARE, but I recognize it served as a forum to voice lamentations such as mine. Disgusting.

        The thing that made me laugh out loud was at the 45:00 timestamp where Z Man inadvertently calls the NY AG “Laqueesha”.
I think the Kween’s name is Latisha, but I really don’t know and really don’t care.
its just the funny part that Z Man defaults to an amusing knee-grow woman’s name.
it made me laugh out loud.

It also looks like the  BlackRock war to exterminate and drive the Ukrainians will continue Ukraine is destroyed. and empty.thought experiment: since Israel is already serious losses in Gaza, a long war with Iran could leave the IDF in very bad shape.wouldn’t it be wise to get the Israeli’s out of danger by moving them from there to the newly rebuilt but empty Ukraine?  except for the part ceeded to Russia for their work in the clearing operation .Nah!  couldn’t happen, these things aren’t planned, just random coincidences.

                A curious linguistic phenomenon, that when someone mentions a set or a class of objects or people, moderns immediately assume it means “ALL.” Nothing in these statements indicates that you, personally, are being addressed by this comment.
Rather womanly of you, to take general statements about concepts (“generations”) and immediately assume that the statement is directed at you, and requires an immediate Boomer response of cuss words and a middle finger. And the “crack” and “sip” of a beer being opened.

                Kinda sad how so few people can handle math anymore. The voting age was 18 in some states and not others. In order to be 18 in time to vote for any of your Congresscritters in ’64, you would have to have been born no later than early November, 1946. So maybe a 10 month span of Boomers. And that would have represented a tiny fraction of the electorate, who almost certainly had no effect on the outcome.
Maffs hard.

        OT Trump is not stupid. He knows he dodged a bullet by the grace of God. He likely knows that it was an inside job by the Deep State. And they will not stop, even if he continues to survive and gets elected by some miracle. The hard part now becomes “how do you fight back?” This is the same dilemma that every Mafia boss faced day in and day out. There are tried-and-true old school methods that have appeal (Stalin used purges), but is that optimum in this Brave New World or is there a better way?

        The defeatism in this thinking is just so off-putting.  It’s doubly off-putting because people know how fragile the system is.  Many people are always talking about the coming collapse. At the same time, we have people talking about sunk-cost fallacies and how we just have to “adapt” to the suck.While I do not share the idea that America will “collapse” any time soon, possibly ever, I think it’s obvious bad times are coming within most of our life times.  But, “bad times” also means bad times for the bad guys.  All the free money will dry up.  The bad guys go through enormous sums of money.  Most of the evil they do is financed by the empire. Even freaks like Letrasha James couldn’t do what she is doing if not for the empire, even though she works for NY and not the feds.  NY basically has the empire’s credit rating. When the empire collapses, their credit rating will go down and things done by the feds now will be taken up by the state of NY in their jurisdiction which will cost them money.Only God knows what the future holds.  But defeatism ensures we will lose.

            Good comment, but I disagree about the timeline. A massive crisis is much nearer than we think, whether sparked off by another stolen election or other internal incident, or by what is happening in elsewhere in the world. However, I don’t feel in any way defeatist or black-pilled. This route is the only way the enemy of all that is good can be defeated. Empires have collapsed throughout history, sometimes followed by chaos, other times by the relatively rapid re-establishment of some kind of stability. It also helps if you are religious. if you believe, as I do, that something better awaits us in another dimension, and that the evil people we see around us will be punished, then whatever happens here, no matter how bad, can never totally black-pill you.

                We have no way of knowing when the major crisis will happen, what triggers it or when or even what it will be. Most, myself included assume it will be a financial one, or brought on by finances.  But there are many cracks in the foundation.

        Never take anything at face value. Something else is going on here. VDare could indeed be winding down, but nothing stops them from moving to another state. Why haven’t they taken that very obvious step? Ken Paxton wouldn’t be bombarding them with lawfare. Something smells in my opinion.

            There’s definitely things I don’t understand about the case. I guess the big issue is that they can’t use the name vdare anymore, which is a great name, so it’s the loss of a brand.Or could they? why can’t they just start a np in wva? Why not just have a website? Why does this mean they lose all their archives?ramzpaul said brimelow made 1/2 mill a year as president.maybe he can’t make that much if it’s not structured in the way it was.

                Why not? When they wind down, they can sell the IP rights to a third party who can go back to business as usual. Like General Motors where they sold the good assets to “New GM” and the crappy assets were left inside the old company.

                    Exactly. It’s entirely the point of the podcast. Didn’t they listen? They are many, many ways to route around and solve this via back channels that are not subject to cancellation **if** that is really your goal.

They are from an age that quite easily turned a sincere belief into a money making operation. Non profits are a way to launder profit. The DA might in fact be on the side of every sincere nationalist who ever gave to the couple.

                    It has not gone without notice that James will bring a frivolous lawsuit and prevail. Even with that low standard she apparently didn’t have enough to go forward against Vdare so that indicates her purpose was to destroy via discovery an entity she didn’t like due to political differences. That doesn’t mean Vdare is squeaky clean, of course, but it is reprehensible.Z’s podcast today, substantively the best I have heard from him, makes clear this is a degraded and debased system that no longer has legitimacy or can be reformed. James reflects that reality. I’m relatively certain her purpose was to destroy nationalists BAMN.

            The mass cancellation effort against VDare is real, and has been devastating. And I know from personal experience that Peter Brimelow is not only a very devoted man, but also personally generous.
Lydia Brimelow explains the crippling hardships they have faced in detail in her statement now available athttps://vdare.com/(it looks like most of VDare’s content is now sadly unavailable). It’s not just the lawfare by Letitia James.  Basically, as Lydia says, “VDARE.com is excluded from the world of business” because of the constant cancellations of companies that they try to do business with.

                                There’s no conspiracy here. Move to another state, get another bank. Sioux Falls is the banking capital of the Plains. You can’t tell me there isn’t a bank in Sioux Falls that will deal with you. You don’t have to go to Citibank and Wells Fargo (also based in South Dakota, at least on paper). There are several reasonably-sized banks there that are locally based.
Something smells. Maybe these people were pulling an NRA and fleecing the 501(c)(3). It wouldn’t be the first time.

                                    You think you can get credit card processing services from a small town state bank?  It is explained in the videos they posted, they went to GabPay and even they got cutoff from processing.  You can look at VDare’s 990s online if you want to see how much money they were raising each year.  It was a trivial amount to attract the attention of the New York State AG.

                                        Maybe they had a lot of chargebacks. Maybe they were sleazy about stopping payments when people requested it. There are all kinds of things that could have been going on. Like I said, after what happened with the NRA, it pays to be suspicious. Nonprofits are easy to abuse. Trust nobody, especially on the internet.

                                            They have given a detailed explanation, they were blacklisted by payment processors for their political views. Either you are willing to accept a reasonable explanation or not.  Do you think Letita James was going after them because of how they processed credit card payments?  If you think they were cutoff for chargebacks you have mental retardation.

                I know a lot of people like &amp; respect VDare, and I was a huge fan of The Derb, so maybe I’m way off-base here, but VDare has always struck me as a bit of a grifting operation. I may agree with them on a great many things, but they were essentially a tabloid; one of those conservative sites that traffics in anger and outrage. They are no different than Revolver or Breitbart, except they are closer to the DR.Brimelow is a yesterday man. He should have seen the knives out for him but he kept his operation in NY State. If only he had read his own publication, which was rife with stories of the imminent collapse of western civilization by the advancing armies of the Left. He should have known to scale down or get out of NY State. So either VDare was stupid or there was a grift going on. I hate to say that, I really do.Anyway, I prefer my right-wing news to be irreverent and funny, not gloomy and ragepilled.

                    I agree on the whiff of grift about the whole thing, and we will probably be downvoted hard for it.  But so be it.
Not to mention the seeming preposterousness of a foreigner as the voice on American immigration restrictionism.
And Brimelow had to know that would always be something on everyone’s mind.  I never heard him address it, but maybe he has.

Yeah I agree with Brimelow’s sentiment, but…we don’t need raised eyebrows.

                        For crying out loud, Peter Brimelow is an American citizen, born in England of English ancestry!
You can’t get much more American than that.  The settlers of Roanoke Island, Jamestown, etc. were English!  America for a long time had English culture in case people here didn’t know that crucial fact.

                            One of the Jamestown settlers was Martin The Armenian. He arrived with the intention of introducing silk farming to the new land. Martin also brought European honeybees with him. Simply pointing out that not all settlers hailed from the British Isles. It’s a Friday and you kniw what they say about it: only Robinson Crusoe had everything done by Friday.

                            Recent English aristocracy has intermarried with a certain international group. His whole life story has me looking around for an Early Life section. In any case, it’s the same class of people who largely threw the American people under the bus the first time.

                        There is an either/or vibe here that is depressing: EITHER the Brimelows are hopeless sentimentalists buried by a system and a new world they cannot understand, OR they are grifters playing off the equally hopeless sentimentality of their supporters, and now their grift has been brought low.
Is it possible that no one here really knows what the fuck they are talking about?

                    “Ragepilled”. I like that. My own encounters with Vdare over the years have started with getting my Radio Derb link, then reading a story here and there. But my gosh, the never-ending roll-call of travesties against our country, against white people, against common sense, all on a website continually begging me for cash… yeah, “irreverent and funny” hardly describes anything offered at Vdare. That said, so much stone-cold truth…

                        The problem was not people doing the hard and dirty work, making us uncomfortable, the problem was ‘the never-ending roll-call of travesties’ and keeping them from being memory-holed.
The Brimelows were chroniclers.
Poor boo’s whine, “they just wanted to spoil our fun!”Well, just touch in occasionally, then, before forgetting the name of the next victim.

            “…nothing stops them from moving to another state. “I know nothing in particular here, but from a quick reading of the Brimelow postings cited, it seems a case of, “you can run, but not hide”. Hide in this case needs a bit of thrashing out.For one, the internet extends across all States. We seem to read everyday of States in compact suing some provider of services as a group. But really, as Lydia states, Vdare seems to be the victim of suppression by nationwide service providers. For one example, banks—which seem to tout themselves as public service providers, but can pick and choose just who they define as “public” and their responsibilities towards such.Leaving Vdare aside, I’m hearing the same thing occurring with banks and “coin shops” who sell gold and silver coinage. Seems today a business that generates lots of anonymous high cash transactions is no longer welcome to do business at most major banks. At first I thought this a feature of overbearing Fed reporting regulations, but as Lydia suggested, perhaps this “regulation” is a designed feature to repress such businesses? Gun shops are in the beginning stages of such repression, but at least have some major rights organizations taking on the Fed’s.There is a bright side (?) to all this, that of the underground. Again, not to get too specific, but the internet finds ways around all blockage. We, as dissidents will simply need to get smarter and avail ourselves of such. Example, digital currency, like Bitcoin. My local supermarket has a Bitcoin machine. Of course, there has been a “dark web” around forever.  Perhaps though it will be easier to simply host abroad.  I use such sites and although they can get taken down, they pop right back up elsewhere—wack a mole style.There are tools still available to get the word out. Vdare might just be the push needed to get these alternative pathways into more common use.

                Yes. Black markets are in some sense the present.Also, some states–Florida, Iowa, your home state ofArizona, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana and South Dakota, have moved against banks that discriminate due to political beliefs. Treasury of course has opposed them, but when wealthy states like Florida and Georgia take action, the banks are put on the spot. The rubber will meet the road when one of those states doesn’t allow X Federal Bank to do business. I suspect one of the major reasons there is such a push to control the central government is to implement a digital currency and to checkmate states. This likely also explains why some elites have gone a bit rogue.

                I have some experience with both websites and dealing with the setup of these corporations. It’s the work of almost no money to get another website provider. They are not as famous as their fans imagine.Gab is up and running and they have had a lot more bad press than VDARE. They still have a bank. They still have an Internet connection. It’s annoying, but there’s a still ton of choice out there. Pointing to a few services that may no longer be working with them, perhaps for reasons we are not privy to, is not proof of inability to find services.Alex Jones and Stormfront were formally deplatformed. Still out there. I’m sure if they own a castle in WV, they can figure this out.

The State of New York does, however. Or did. I’m not sure if VDare’s liquidation nullifies it’s position as 501-c-3 holder. NY i believe you need their permission to getnrid of it. IIRC, that was their big problem, getting rid of that shackle before they ran out of money.

                Watching YouTube yesterday I was reminded of Louis “NotOurGuy” Rossman’s issue with New York where they were trying to fine him to death for regulatory fees on an employee who never worked in New York at a time when Rossman’s business was no longer in New York.  My thought too was that even if NY wasn’t being malicious it’s possible they still would have killed off VDare from neglect.

In fact, didn’t he repeat those same sentiments in the very post at the top of this age? And now you’re junking me when I say it?
Which is it, guys? Obviously, consistency is not high on your list of priorities.

                                        You’re also playing by the rules. And the rule is that you judge all people and entities, regardless of their politics, by the same standard. Well, ID, if you really are on the right, then you’re a chump. We should uncategorically defend and not condemn people and entities on the right, even if foolish behavior on their part draws the eye and the ire of Sauros. In existential struggles, you defend your friends. Always. If those of us on the right aren’t willing to do this, then we probably deserve to perish.

Take it from someone (me) who has both the IQ and the unwavering loyalty of a dog-
This, this right here. This is what to Tribe Up means.
Look to the blacks.  No matter how stupid, or scummy, or evil, they always defend their own without hesitation or reservation.

                There are two ways of doing this. They could merge with a non-profit formed in another state or they can form a new entity and sell off the intellectual property to that new entity.

            Brimelow strikes me as a generally decent guy, but he was a financial journalist and has an MBA and I think he has this wannabe and especially British plutocrat side to him.  And mixing journalism with business always had a strange taste to it for me, as they are sort of emblematic of competing mindsets – one writes, while one does.  It was a mix that never could quite meld into a winning formula for me, tasting a bit like black ink and coins, the two things that for me have always captured the tastes of journalism and business for me, respectively.  Yes, I have tasted ink and have put coins in my mouth before, and that is my takeaway on the essence of these two things.  Which leads to, I always found his writing, and Vdare in general, as somewhat schizophrenic as not knowing if it was a Forbes or a journalistic/academic quarterly.I get that it is a complex topic they were dealing with, but with some editing and art direction the site could have been much more appealing.  But then you bring up the website, lately at least, and you get a parade of white faces who died at the hands of blacks.  Non stop.  And then the grown men whining, the same problem I have with Amren.  I can hear the whimpering like children, “Look what these people are doing to us!!!!  It’s not fair!  When is someone going to say something?!”Followed by the requisite “Look I am never here to condone violence of ANY kind.”The routine quickly gets tiring.And my wife, who is about as far removed from this stuff as can be but has good insights into people, saw me on the internet and started asking who is that old ugly dude with the young wife and, as a woman, was completely put off by it.  I am sure she is not alone.  That even struck me as strange.  I am too conventional in many respects to look at Brimelow and then his wife and not think something isn’t right.  But maybe again that is just his way of fancying himself a British lord of some kind in his castle.

                You summed it up pretty well. An aging Brit who bases himself in a castle and is involved in some weird May-December romance is not someone who is serious about American border concerns, and the stable of cranks and loons he had writing for his publication did not inspire anybody who wasn’t already ideologically committed to the same padded cell. VDARE was a grift that did nothing except preach to a very odd choir.You see this same pattern recurring throughout the Alt-Right. What is the purpose of it, anyway? The Alt-Right has never achieved anything. It does not produce profound thought or inspiring works of art. It does not engage with the political process, so it has no legislative or policy victories to its credit. It does not have a realistic answer on a single social or economic problem. It’s just a waste of time.VDARE only existed so that people like Peter Brimelow, John Derbyshire, and Jarod Taylor could live the sort of life they fancied for themselves, pretending to be publishing impresarios and intellectuals. The whole thing was absolutely pointless. The loss of VDARE will not make a single bit of practical difference to anybody, and the world s better off without it.

                    This is so stupid. Jared Taylor has his own group and made his money in business before starting it.  Whatever he pays himself from AmRen is trivial compared to what he made in his life. We should be grateful men like this are spending their time trying to help the country when they could quietly retire.

                        I know people are looking for heroes. I understand why people down vote the OP.Unfortunately, my opinion of Taylor in particular was of a man who wanted to be intellectual…and earn money for it. None of these very wealthy men do anything but hold conferences, write columns, collect money, and rinse and repeat.A house built or car restored would have been time better spent. They are not even passing on what little they have built to the next generation.

                            I read JT’sWhite Identitya few years ago; it never struck me as an intellectual book at all. It was rather a long, unrelenting narrative of the outrages committed against whites, precisely because they are/were white.
Could it be that Taylor wants the truth to be recorded? That his objectives are honorable? Controversial response?Maybe.

                        He agrees, he just doesn’t want to “agree” in the sense that ordinary people understand. He wants to show off. At a guess, ID is in his twenties and has recently finished (at any rate attended) college, and has read or skimmed many books, essays and other assigned readings.I remember being that way myself in my twenties. My goodness, could I turn a phrase or reproduce an argument! Forty years ago, sadly. Then life intervened and at some point in my thirties I decided that maybe I wasn’t the next Bertrand Russell after all.You reach a point when there is nothing you can say, really, except “don’t shit on my forty-year edge on you, punk.”

                    The alt-right, so called, is a dying thing.  I think Z is smart and cagey enough to have seen the writing on the wall and is therefore trying to branch out.It had its time when middle America was seeing itself transform demographically, and this was the primal scream as it were.  Anyone from California, for example, was non-plussed, having seen the transformation take place decades prior, and the solution was for the ones who couldn’t deal with it to go to the Pacific Northwest and start anew or the ones like me to just ride it out and see where it went, for me as a type of curiosity.  But in the end I feel richer for it, because I have come to truly like many Mexicans rather than get angry over their being here.  And that same thing is going to happen everywhere.  If the number of white guys marrying Latinas is any indication, that’s a big part of America’s future.The whole white identity thing is also riding on a false premise.  There are many holes in its theories, but the fundamental flaw is that it has a very unsophisticated understanding of identity.  It’s one-dimensional and bases itself on the “observer,” meaning your identity is the one people looking at you apply to you, or you are what others say you are, which is the mentality of the American county jail or state prison, which in itself says something far more interesting about the current state of things than pretty much anything else does.  Coupled with a general prison ethos and aesthetic in America, where you have to imagine a man is a woman because that’s the best on offer, or taking the bull dyke out of supervising the jail swirling a baton to now being your boss or Senator, or getting all excited about the prospects of voting for your warden although it’s already been decided.  If there is any true interest to be had from this white identity thing, it is how it fits into the larger Neo-liberal one-dimensional, doctrinaire way of thinking where the smaller human concerns and one’s simpler feelings are treated as irrelevant or with contempt.The ones pigeonholing you by your race often take their cues from the anthropologist or social scientist which gives the whole thing perhaps an unwanted dank stink of old books in a community college library.  Your own internal identity or how you see yourself is discarded as being unimportant, that identities can change based on circumstances, your identity as an uncle or son or brother in a family is given zero meaning.  There are so many identities only because identity, in the external sense, is comparative.  It is NEVER fixed as it is in their telling.Then there is the unavoidable fact of life: you may not know you are until you are 70 years old, if even then.  People go “searching” for themselves their entire lives in many cases.  We are complex.  So if even I can’t truly know who I am, how does Greg Johnson or Jared Taylor or Peter Brimelow?  But there they are, asking me to put aside all of these questions and just accept that I am white and therefore I need to join with them to fight off the black guys.  That is essentially what it comes down to, they are just looking for back up. And donations.  If they would just say that, put aside the obvious pretensions, that would be great, but they have to go all scientist and anthropologist on us.  Fucking idiots.

                Yes, that marriage is wronity wrong. The British in particular were (and still are) overwhelmed with a particular group looking to intermarry. Lots of 18th and 19th century marriages, to the point where it’s hard to trace the Gentile lines.I promise that everyone I don’t like is not from the group. It’s just that his life story sounds awfully stereotypical of one particular nation, including his attachment to NY.

            I’m not a lawyer, don’t even play one on TV, but I’ll take rank speculation for $100 Alex. I guess, but don’t know, that a likely answer is that the law can pester the principals of a corporation even if that corporation ceases to exist, whatever the legal term is. Of course there are statutes of limitations and lack of jurisdiction etc. but my point is that, likely, there is plenty of stuff for which therearen’tany limitations. If I murdered someone in New York and quickly moved to Texas, that doesn’t make the murder charge disappear. I suspect that in many cases the same applies in civil law.

                Well, with current “lawfare” as practiced in NYC, limitation statutes seem meaningless when they can be changed retroactively to suit the prosecution.  This was the essence of Trump’s lost trial for sexual misconduct vis a vis a 30 yo accusation.  That trial was geared to bankrupt and tarnish him.  It failed because it became so publicized that it raised his status in the common man’s eyes. It succeeded however in raising the stakes financially for Trump.I believe SCOTUS has yet to rule on this and that’s want Trump is counting on.  The 8th Amendment certainly would come into play here just on the amount of the verdict.

        Gilbert chesterton has an interesting article on hamlet and psycho analysis, which was the rigor during the turn of the century.  The Freudian part is kinda irrelevant but what’s startling is that he says that hamlet knew he must kill his uncle who was an overt tyrant, but that doing the right thing is hard.He says hamlet is about punishment and moral intent. He doesn’t say it’s about whining and protesting and begging the police of the government to do something after it’s been proven that they are part of the tyranny.He says hamlet is about a primitive morality (in this way I was reminded of The trial of Socrates by Greg Johnson) which I think as whites we are reduced to now. We have no representation. We have no legal outlet for justice because the system, that is all institutions of power, violence and control, are held by people that hate whites, or are indifferent to our well being as whites (compared to the conservative view “one race the human race”.Chesterton writes concerning hamlet:1 it may be our business to do the right thing (the “ may be “ is a very precise way to put it.)2 that doing the right thing MAY involve punishing some person, especially a powerful person.3 that the just form of punishment may take the form of fighting and killingWhile hamlet himself as a prince was an authority of sorts, and there was no real authority to go to to redress the issue of this murder of the king, as whites, we have no peaceful redress. Kyle rittenhouse was a fluke, the courts, in principle, are against whites, it’s accidental that a white will get justice in the courts. Look at the ss. At best they were indifferent to the safety of the closest thing we have to a leader, djt, and trump would never say he thinks whites have a right to survive.Violence is always lurking in civilization. Going to the store and returning only happens because someone who wants to hit you on the head for whatever reason fears violence in some way. My ancestors built a country for me and my kind, and state violence use to be about deterring violence against me and my kind, white Americans, (“us” “we” “our”.) Now the state has been taken over by our enemies. State violence is now either accidentally protecting whites, indifferent or outright hostile.Are whites not in a primitive moral situation?I’ve never heard anyone call Chesterton a fed

        [Today’s rant 100% Nietzsche free!]We truly are descending into a dark age. There are so many factors stacked against us (if “us” is understood as longing for the way the nation was decades ago) that I suspect the best outcome we can hope for is a gradual slide into mediocrity, a managed decline. Letita James, Fani Willis, or Kamala Harris are the advance guard of a “darker” future.We seem to be well down the refuse chute into anarcho-tyranny. In the area of what came to be called civil rights, I see a perverse reversal of roles. There’s no denying that as recently as the early 1960s in the Deep South that there was, for lack of a better name, vigilante “justice.” If you look up statistics of lynching, over its entire period (back to the 19th century), even among civil rights advocates you’d find that the victims number in the many hundreds, maybe the low four digits. Now it’s worth mentioning that many of those who died at the hands of a mob probably were, in fact, guilty of some serious offense, and some of them no doubt meriting a death penalty. But not all of them. And then as now, the person who valued civilization would recoil at the thought that the (theoretically) orderly system of justice was aborted.Now, let me indulge some of the worst accounts of the pro-Civil Rights folk of the 50s and 60s. No doubt that many Negroes were harassed or even killed. Whites who were attempting to register them to vote or whatever wound up dead. These and many other atrocities (and that’s not an unfair term in this context) were of course what led to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and similar legislation.I’ll gloss over the several decades of intervening court decisions, additional laws, and government programs. Even if all well intentioned, the results at best were mixed. Especially from the dissident view, I’d think a strong argument is made that everybody is even worse off, even the minorities who the various legal upheavals were intended to aid. If one could total the costs of “Civil Rights”, e.g. in terms of murders and other serious crime, I suspect we’d have body count and other costs far in excess of the worst claimed carnage of the Jim Crow era.Over three or more generations, there’s been aninversion of values. Affirmative Action has placed under- or even straight-up unqualified people in powerful positions. That, in part, explains why we see the various forms of lawfare. At least in some places, the oppressors have become the oppressed, the hunters now the hunted. Those in power may think this legitimate retribution. A lot of these people are not very smart, thus one can only speculate on what more intelligent (?) behind-the-scenes people really pull the strings.If these trends continue, I fear that one outcome may be that the dispossessed will increasingly realize that the law no longer protects them. Individuals will increasingly view, possibly correctly, that if they want certain problems rectified, they will have to take matters into their own hands. TomA’santibodyeventually becomes the only practical alternative. At some point, even the legal threat of having one’s property, one’s freedom or one’s life taken away loses its deterrent value. If your only option is to enter the game all-in no-limit stakes, then it becomes a coldly rational motive to use the “shoot, shovel, shut up” method or its variant.Of course one needn’t be a guerilla assassin. As Z cites, even citizens subduing lunatics on a subway face severe punishment when things go badly. Not all that different from any number of cops doing their duty and protected class is injured or killed. At some point, the rational choice is to sit back and take the abuse passively. Or, if one intends to do something about it, it’ll be done covertly, arbitrarily and brutally. As the old English saying has it, if you’re risking the gallows, you might as well hang for an entire flock of sheep as for a lamb. There are limits to penalties.I’m certainly not cheering on such “DIY” proclivity. I’d much prefer living in a predictable, law-abiding society. But that’s slipping away daily. More and more people are reluctantly coming to the realization that the ballot box and the jury box are no longer viable, leaving the cartridge box as the only remaining alternative.That’s why we get 20-year-old radicals with AR15s on rooftops.When there are no agreed-upon rules, every player is free to make up his own.

            “…the rational choice is to sit back and take the abuse passively.”Depends on the abuse/situation.  Everyday, I take abuse passively.  The current Olympics is an example.  However, one can think of a situation directly and immediately concerning “me and mine” where such abuse cannot be accepted passively.  Such situations are growing in number and intensity.  Hence the great unknown is when it comes to head, or critical mass, if you will.This, you’ve pretty much described above—I give you credit for such insight as usual.  However, what you seem to fear, i.e., “the great awakening into “violence”, I welcome.  Better sooner than later.  Our side weakens decade by decade.  Soon it will be too late and what once was will be gone.

                Points well made. If I could revise it, it’d be along these lines: “A civilized person will likely tolerate or perhaps even forgive mistreatment, at least the more minor variety, passively. He may feel powerless against the oppressor. Yet if the abuse continues, won’t it likely lead to some desire for retribution, and perhaps even spur him to some form of revenge?”

                    Accepting mistreatment passively leads to dealing out retribution passively, ie, work to rule, that is, do nothing outside of basic requirements, do not offer help advice or assistance, remove yourself from the scene as much as possible, don’t participate, protest or produce. Sit on your hands and let it fall.

                I’d stay out of the county, to the west most likely.  Cville proper is nuts.  One of my other kids went to W&amp;M ditto there.  Trying to find a balance.  I’d rejoin my g-grandmothers family in far eastern TN if it were solely up to me.

        Although I’ll agree that the prosecution of the NRA was politically motivated, the reality is that the NRA has been wildly mismanaged for the benefit of the leadership over the past few years.  The NRA, unlike VDare, had plenty of money with which to defend themselves, but did not have the moral high ground to defend their indefensible policies.  They are, thankfully, in the process of at least making some changes now that they have been exposed.  I am a life member but haven’t contributed or supported in a few years.  Am hoping that the prosecution will be enough to bring back a great organization.  They will survive and, with luck, be the better for it.

        This is just an outstanding podcast ZMan.I love the stark realism and the manly example of accepting the reality but maintaining dignity and a long term optimism.Your point about the economic elites is great and spot on. I wonder if you could do a show on on this character and this podcast:https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/brand-new-balaji-trump-biden-jan-6/id1661672738?i=1000662818596A synopsis:Balaji claims the 20th century was about the Center defeating the Far Right. He seems to take for granted that they are currently battling the Far Left and will crush them. Then, he declares that the 21st century will be about the Center (an internationalist tech oligarchy) going to war against Nationalism in the 21st century. The theory amounts to the fact that “The Center”, will be an agglomeration of the best and brightest from around the world and thus outcompete nationalists who will be bogged down by constraints on intellectual capital, protectionist concerns and non-meritocratic practices.Interestingly, and like Theil and the rest of these tech savants, their history is always conveniently reductionist. Note his claim that the US won the Cold War because of diversity. He claims the US won because it could pull upon the power of the elites of the world. That is patently wrong. The US, “won”, the Cold War solely with the efforts of a nearly 100% White run government and industrial/business class. It was only 12 years after it was over that the immigrants began to ascend to power in business and become the majority of the non-differentiating front line grunt workers in coding jobs. Yet he claims this victory for multi-culturism and globalism.Even today, SpaceX is almost 100% a White Man’s endeavor, yet he holds it up as a shining example without realizing it refutes his underlying claim.I would love a show or some shows on:Organizing vs. Mobilizing – What organization means and looks likeThe counter-elite tech oligarchy and its War On Nationalism in the 21st CenturyA vision for Heritage Americans in the 21st and 22nd centuryI think we have done criticism and retrospection with a 18th – 20th century lens to death. It is time that our best minds go toe to toe with the likes of Balaji and propose a future. It doesn’t have to refuse elements of what guys like Balaji propose, but it should critique its weak points and reflect our desires and our ancestor’s wisdom in not valuing economic and technological measures and progress higher than they should be valued. Guillaume Faye took a crack at it, but it was way to simplistic and personally romanticized.I think this kind of work could put the people who do it in the most revered 23rd century libraries of Occidental Man’s future civilization. They may well have their statues sculpted and erected alongside the men who take that vision and perform the heroic deeds that are going to bring it to fruition.

        I’d also push the ideas in this podcast to the thing we hear to the effect that things have to get really bad and then everyone will finally unite to expel the rulers and usher in the new golden age.Same energy: loser energy.The examples we have of replacing the elites are nothing at all like awakening the masses. On the Right, they are incidentally nothing at all like organizing, either, I’d point out. Our examples tend to be, well, mustache man, or Franco, or, going further back, the reaction to the Cathars.None of these are organizational achievements, really, though they are stories of a specific kind of organization doing things that replace the elites of a region. I think that’s the real lesson.

            This came up yesterday on Fedi and the thing that stuck out to me at the onset of the Spanish Civil War was that the left could call up tens of thousands of irregular soldiers in their friendly cities.  Theregimeis organized, but the “left” isn’t and our regime couldn’t pull such a stunt.  They can call up some rioters, rioters who will evaporate away once the get rittenhoused, but they’re not getting even 200 people to show up and fight and die for them in any regular sized city.

            What might be helpful for lots of people here is to do some European travels, if they haven’t already.For me this whole situation is not exceedingly alarming because if you spend a lot of time in the old world you can start to get a deeper sense of the parallels and overlay them onto the American situation.  Briefly, we are being ruled by a foreign elite.  That very fact, once understood, will go a very long way in giving Americans the mindset to see through these problems.  And if that foreign elite is removed like a tick I guess then the body resorts to its normal functioning.  Things will just start falling back into normalcy.It’s a decision time.  Either we face up to the reality of our situation, that our government and cultural institutions have been overtaken by a foreign elite, or we go the way of the Palestinians in some form or another.

        Z –It’s interesting how you mention the underdog mentality of the left. I used to be more of a Democrat than I am now because I viewed the rights revolutions of the 50s and 60s as sort of a founding myth.As I began having negative experiences with the left on places like democratic underground or dailykos, i started becoming more heterodox in my views.But one of the reasons I never fully broke away from the democrats (though I’m not voting for Harris) is that I feel the democrats are being discriminated against by our electoral system and the Senate.Is it possible that people like Letitia James has those same kind of attitudes and feels she’s fighting the power by daring scotus to overturn her?

            The “unfairness” of the Electoral System is perhaps mostly exaggerated! People who buy into this rarely “work the numbers”.The House is apportioned as to population (rebalanced every 10 years through Census). Right now each of the 435 House members represent 760k citizens. However, there is a Con Clause of a minimum of one House member per state. 6 States now get an “undeserved” House member. So that’s one bit of unfairness built in.Every State gets 2 Senators. Hard to argue a whole lot of fairness problems there, but again there’s that pesky State population size compared to Senator number. So on one hand a small State gets 2 Senators, but also note the big State still gets many, many more House representatives. This tends to lessen the perceived imbalance. Indeed, there is a set number of Senators at 100, but the set number of Representatives is 435. As noted, those House numbers are reapportioned every 10 years.And there you have your electoral college numbers in nut shell.If there is unfairness, it perhaps lies in the State regulation of their “electors”, most States have all electors selected and pledged for the candidate with the most votes at the State level, or rather the slate of the electors is voted in via the selection of the winning candidate. This is unfair how? It certainly represents how candidates have been elected to local offices since the Founding, i.e., by majority or plurality of votes cast.The unfairness is wrt to the 6 smallest States and some of the smaller rural States. Choose any number greater than zero for their electors—(You’d disenfranchise them?)—however, the numbers they represent are a smallish fraction of the total electoral count.What folks in the large urban area States want is a decision of the winner of the election to be based upon a national vote, rather than a within State by State vote, thereby insuring that they control the Union by gist of their demographic size. It’s been shown that this only requires about 6 or 7 of the large States and the rest of the country’s votes will be rendered meaningless, or rather split evenly along party lines. So what is asked for is nothing less than a reconceptioning of “States’ Rights”.This of course would mean in essence that the very concept of the “United States”—and the distribution of governmental power among them—would eventually be rendered meaningless and in essence the USA would be basically Federally controlled in short order. This is simply changing the agreement of the Founding States, big vs small, during the Constitutional Convention 1787.In our history there have only been *5* Presidential races where the losing candidate has received more votes—and only two of them in the last 130 years. That is not indicative of a broken system and I’ll also add, those two elections were defeats of Lefties and their Dem Party.

                I’d add that the Constitution would never have passed without the states being represented in both houses, one representing popular interests, the other representing state interests. The intent was that for a law to be enacted, it had to be good for the peopleandgood for the states.

                A friendly correction:  its one Rep per 760K people, not citizens.  The illegals count as much as us.  California for example gets more clout in the House than it deserves.  The illegals don’t even need to vote to skew the numbers.

        Yes, the Boomer man in charge of VDARE said they was lawfared out of existence. There may even been some truth to it. I have my doubts however.The whole story does however fit a narrative of the West post 1960’s.

        Being honest, the people at Vdare were jerks.  When I first got into them maybe 10 years ago I would donate and so forth, and never got a thank you.  And then you would write a certain author, who was basically a part timer at vdare and had plenty of time, he would never even acknowledge it.  This went on for a while.I don’t know, but I am BIG into customer service.  So maybe it is my pet peeve clouding the situation, but a little less being intellectuals and a little more customer satisfaction and they would have gone much farther.  And I know I am not alone in my criticisms.

But I won’t.  And I never received diddly squat.  They took the money and ran.
But I never wrote Derbyshire, and never much followed him, and I wasn’t referring to him.  Not sure what makes you think I was, if that’s what can be gleaned by your comment.

                    They sent me thank you emails for my donations.  Not that I wouldn’t have donated if they didn’t.  I saw them as providing a valuable service I was willing to contribute towards.  Maybe you just missed it in your spam.  You wanted a hand written note?  The Brimelows are good American patriots who deserved much better than this.  I will miss the site and was proud to contribute to it.

                It’s not very complicated, but most people just don’t have the temperament for it, but there are two rules for the small businessman that I have always found are necessary for success.Customer is always right.  OR the customer always deserves the utmost respect.NEVER EVER over-promise and under-deliver.And not to brag, but just making it known so I don’t seem like I am talking out my butt, but I have made millions in my life living by those rules.  Much of it has been squandered unfortunately, but I am in a new chapter in my life now and what’s done is done.

                    No, usually the customer is wrong and is costing you money besides.  A very small percentage of your customers cost the most money.  I once did tech support to the general public. It was the same 1000 people calling over and over and over.  One guy called so often, I knew his name by voice.  He had the cheapest plan you could buy and called at least once a week.  The guy was old and lonely and wanted someone to talk to and he got it for $4.99 a month!  It was an 800 number, so we paid for the call.

                        Tars.  It works both ways to an extent.  In my early career, pre-internet, computer support staff at the main computer center *all* had to work the consulting desk for a few hours per week in addition to their normal work routine—even the Director of the Computing Center!  Sure the low level peons worked more hours, but we all took some hours on this duty.  Our hours and expertise was posted for all to see and plan for.  I still to this day, consider this requirement an excellent outreach, but have not seen it since.My first insight from this very humbling experience was that I began consulting in areas which I had no training, nor experience!  How?  Well, I listened to the person next to me and began to realize that the same questions were being asked in some fields by our users over and over again.  I memorized them and the answers.Sometimes someone would have a question in a programming assignment that bombed during a run in some language I’d never heard of and I still was able to help.  I simply asked the user any number of questions concerning variables, functions, organization, desired outcome and such and more often than not the programming error became apparent to the both of us and the correction installed.Now, almost 50 years later, I’m still finding this experience useful in putting together my thoughts on critical thinking and human thought processes.

                            My experience is you should do the opposite.  Most technical people in the IT (I’ve been in corp IT since I left that tech support job) dept cannot talk to normal people.   We do our best to hide them away from everyone. I was just like this at one time.  But I learned in my second IT job to turn that on and off.  Nobody is every impressed by your knowledge, they’re offended and think you are calling them stupid.  The opposite is also true. The more you talk to them like a complete dummy, the more they like you.I once managed the IT depts in 3 remote offices.  One was about 100 people, one was about 75 and the last was was like 10.  They could not keep this position filled. Each of the offices was constantly complaining to corp HQ about whoever they sent. It was entirely this problem along with the aloofness so many IT folks have. We come across rude and condescending.   All these people wanted was to feel like they had a friend in the IT dept which I made them believe they did.  I never got any complaints. It’s not like the guys before me couldn’t do the job. It wasn’t that hard.  They couldn’t talk to people, especially really low end people like secretaries.  They work for “important” people and they love to complain.

And btw, many of my consultees were high level research faculty.  You fail to show due deference, your career has an abrupt ending.

            Even if Vdare was a massive grift and assholish, and I honestly have no opinion on that one way or the other, what was done to it is an outrage and a crime that never will be punished under the current system. That is the takeaway. Better customer service and the additional money that would have garnered would not have protected it. Trump is a billionaire and has been criminally convicted and targeted for assassination by the current system because it can. The system destroys regardless of merit.

                The system can destroy when there is no will to keep things going. Trump has made it a long way, for better or worse, because he as been determined to keep going.

                    The system can destroy even if there is a very strong will to keep going. Granted, it makes it easier when there is no will, but that in and of itself is no silver bullet. As for Trump, I remain agnostic. It may destroy him yet, it may coopt him, or he may overcome it, but what has been done to him speaks for itself. I do hope it is the latter outcome if for no other reason than the damage it represents to the system.

                Yep, that is what Vdare represents, a shot across the bow if you will.  We can all learn from their mistakes—and it may very well be that they could do little else at the time.  A critique here is not synonymous with a condemnation.
Stupid people don’t learn from their mistakes, normal people do, and above average people learn from “other people’s” mistakes.

                    Again, I have no solid opinion on Vdare or even enough familiarity to form one, but what I read there often was quite naive, the sort of stuff Normies believed in the Eighties. That aside, the grotesque abuse of power used against Vdare is something that needs to die or be destroyed. I hope to see it in my lifetime.

                VDARE was not a massive grift and assholish. Why do I know this? I know it because I read VDARE for years, linked to Radio Derb, and found myself informed by its content… and I never gave them a dime. Should I have given them something? Maybe, but one finds oneself confronted with charity requests all the time, and the thing is, I have this charity called “My Retirement Charity” as well as others that are serious to me. If VDARE can’t hang in there, it’s their problem not mine. Doesn’t make them grifters.

            What turned me off about them is I once made the mistake of sending them an email.  My sending them an email is an invitation to spam me with ads and solicitation emails near daily for 10 years.  I sent them messages asking them to remove from their email list.  Never replied and never even slowed down the emails.Frankly, I’m jealous they left you alone, but couldn’t leave me alone.  My email exists for my benefit, not yours.  Same with my phone and postal address.  I’ve been an adult for nearly 40 years and never once have I bought anything from an unsolicited ad.  NEVER. Not even one time. But it doesn’t help.
