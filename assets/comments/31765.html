        Hi folks
I get the idea of creating a map with color scales for ideology of governments.
Problem : I can‚Äôt decide which one is ‚Äúliberal‚Äù, ‚Äúconservative‚Äù or ‚Äúpopulist‚Äù for the period 1789-1920
I guess Jackson was populist, but what about Tyler, Van Buren, Jefferson, McKinley and co ?
If some fellow Americans could help me‚Ä¶ üôÇ

        ‚Äú‚Ä¶ America is falling into gangsterism.‚Äù
Falling since when?  Maybe 1861.  Or 1913.  Perhaps 1917.  Could be post 1945, as in Vietnam, the Kennedy murders.  certainly 9/11, the Covid pysop, 2020 election, Jan 6.
It‚Äôs not falling, it has fallen.  And it was a very long time ago.

        Woops, I forgot that other bit of confusion: the owner of the Crocus is an American friend of Donald Trump and has a foreign-born Jewish wife and son.  (Not from Israel.)
I just saw the NYT has put out a full backstory on ‚ÄúISIS-K‚Äù, as if we‚Äôre hearing about the nefarious KAOS for the first time!  Somebody, call Agent Smart and Ninety-Nine on his shoe phone!

        Vladimir Putin has certainly not been reticent to strike out at various ex-Regime members of his own nation he deemed threats. Alexander Litivinko, Alexy Navalny, the Skripals, all have been sent unmistakable messages. So too have those around them.Yet, for some reason (fear of escalation, desire to avoid explicit NATO troop involvement, something else) Putin has NOT retaliated for: the blowing up of Nordstream, the assassination of Darina Dugina, the assassination of the Moscow Russian mil-blogger, the blowing up of the Kerch bridge, the sinking of half the Russian Navy, the attacks on Belgorod both missile/artillery and various 10/7 incursions, the repeated attacks on Crimea, the attacks on deep inside Russia Strategic Air bases, and the attacks on Russian oil refineries, many deep inside Russia. LIKE this attack, all required considerable CIA/US Military involvement. There was no other way for example for Ukraine to find and hit Russian Refineries so deep inside Russia without US satellite help.Who provided the car, the cash, and the weapons (not easy to obtain even in Russia)? Who provided the training? Who surveilled the place, and staged the attack right during Rush Hour so responding police/security would be stymied by traffic? Who provided the exit plan, and the mad dash for the border?Very likely to Putin the answer will be the CIA. And Nuland.Nuland is of course untouchable. She even though retired no doubt sits behind a security curtain of the best and most alert, with likely massive security unseen but lurking around. However there are no lack of other targets eminently reachable. Putin‚Äôs past history suggests that a lot of regime journalist/propaganda hos, toadies, and other lower level functionaries will be targets. Perhaps even Nuland, even the best security can be overwhelmed by sheer numbers and there is no shortage of young men from third world hell-holes with criminal experience willing to hit a target for money. Russia has money. And a history of targeting Regime enemies without heavy security presence.And that‚Äôs a message.Whatever restraints Putin likely had are now gone, he cannot appear weak and pro-Western at this point.

            Putin could really shake things up if he wanted.
Because of resignations, the U.S. house rep majority is now in peril.
Imagine the chaos he could cause if he took out 1-2 neocon Republicans and let Hakeem Jeffries become majority leader.
Yeah, the Dems are just as big war mongers.  But imagine the implications of foreign agents causing a change of power in the U.S legislative branch.
Chaos

                I think he will target those who are close to the power players, and their support network. This was the approach taken by the CIA to remove Pablo Escobar. Message was sent.
Victoria Nuland has lots of security. But do her lawyers, publicists, bankers, etc. have security?
That was the weakness of Escobar. He could not provide security for his support network and thus ran out of options and security.

            No one is untouchable especially Nuland. Besides of the three names you mentioned, two of them were not Russian hits I‚Äôm sure, Navalny and the Skripals were MI6/CIA hits to blame on Russia.
Besides that, the Western elite have lived their whole lives never having faced any consequence for anything they‚Äôve done. They aren‚Äôt prepared to face judgement day. I‚Äôd bet the security around Nuland and the rest is pretty light.

        We all (seem to) agree that this was an unusual attack, but seem to be skipping over that the guys arrested for it claim that they were recruited and directed by an anonymous party online.I don‚Äôt believe four men can simultaneously be stupid enough to act this way on behalf of a stranger, and also smart enough to maintain secrecy for a month prior to the operation.We could suppose all day who the mastermind was with that in consideration, but I believe that is irrelevant because all sides will pick a favorite story and act accordingly. What I think WILL matter to the average American audience is the ‚Äúanonymous mastermind‚Äù angle.I forsee an MSM narrative around ‚Äúradicalization‚Äù by ‚Äúanonymous masterminds‚Äù as a tool to stiffle speech further. After all, didn‚Äôt four regular, poor, family men just get pushed to violence by a paltry $5k payday? Surely this ability to influence must be stopped!

        The thing about the glowies is this: compartmentalizaion means they don‚Äôt know anything about anything they don‚Äôt know they know.  And even then what they know may turn out to be bullshit.  They tend to fall for their own propaganda in the NYT or WaPo or the Economist.  Among the higher-ups, the need not to know to preserve a figleaf of deniability means that no one knows much of anything, much less everything.I have a non-imaginary friend with a clearance.   He works for one of the 17 joke-and-dagger agencies, is well-read, well-travelled, and speaks multiple languages.  I do not know what he does, I do not ask what he does, and he has never said a word about what he does.But what he has said about world affairs over the years has led me to believe that, outside of this or that person‚Äôs particular area of expertise (and sometimes maybe inside it, too) these people are less informed and have less of a big picture view than people who read Z or Moon of Alabama or Naked Capitalism or India Punchline or Dancing With Bears or any of the dozens of other sites who dare to consider we may be being lied to‚Ä¶

When we start seeing Russian delivery vans arriving at Kagan and Mayorkas-related doorsteps, well, perhaps quiet negotiations will begin in earnest.

        Hi. I‚Äôm from Russia, I want to make an amendment. They were given not 500 thousand dollars each, but 500 thousand rubles (5400 dollars), moreover, FOR EVERYONE. Initially, one of them said that they received 500 thousand rubles (5,400) each, which was perceived by us as an extremely ridiculous amount, even offensively small. Now we are talking about the fact that this money was intended for everyone. I suppose there was no money at all, and this amount was used in one way or another to prepare a terrorist attack, because it‚Äôs ridiculous. Thank you. I‚Äôve been waiting for your text. I‚Äôll quote you on my TG channel, if you don‚Äôt mind.

            He is correct. I ask, as a follow-up, a genuine question. The annual income per capita is around 700 dollars. I realize how fuzzy these ideas get (regions, purchasing power, etc.). Could this not be, however, construed as a decent deal of money for people there? I know nothing of Tajikistan.

                In Tajikistan, this is considered a large sum, right. But funny in Russia. These people have families, children, they worked in Moscow, they know that about 100,000 rubles per person is a very ridiculous amount. These are two of their average monthly salaries. Money is definitely not motivation.

                There are two groups of nationalists in Russia. The first are state-owned, they maintain a position close to the state, support the war with Ukraine and the general state narrative. They are leaning towards ISIS with some degree of Ukrainian involvement. The second group (I belong to it) has not yet seen a Ukrainian trace, so so far we are blaming only Islamic fundamentalists. In fact, this is a very strange terrorist attack with a lot of unknown details, they did not put forward statements, manifestos, they just came and killed a lot of people. They are not suicide bombers, because they chose a good place to leave (Crocus City is located on the MKAD, it is easy to leave Moscow from there, which they did), they drove for 10 hours towards Ukraine. They were very unusually equipped, not all of them had rifle training. They studied the building for a month. The very fact of escaping to Ukraine says nothing, I suppose any criminal will try to escape to them, because there is nowhere else. But this has never happened before. We don‚Äôt know what to think yet and who to blame. Putin, of course, cautiously accuses Ukraine, but there is no fact of that yet. However, this is a very strange terrorist attack.

                    The style, shooting up a public venue, seems similar to the bataclan attack in France or the theater attack in Moscow about twenty years ago. But those were hardcore Islamic fanatics that expected to die and left no one in doubt who they were. So yes, this does seem strange. Maybe it was proof of concept by people who have planned more such attacks in Russia or the West??
Btw, interesting to hear you guys also have controlled opposition. Tons of that here

Empire is collapsing, rats are jumping sinking ship and remaining deepstaters do not have necessary means and competent manpower anymore to arrange decent terrorist attack. Or whatever attack.
Hitler Germany at the end of the war suffered similar fate. Competent people understood that war is lost, went into hiding and last operations were weird mess where incompetent civilians without proper equipment tried to do something for their collapsing 1000 year Reich. Some were remarkably successful but most failed badly and only beclowned themselves.

                        They were moving along the M3 federal highway, they were detained equidistant from Ukraine and Belarus, a hundred kilometers from the border. It made no sense for them to go to Belarus, there was little chance of going to Ukraine. It‚Äôs easy to blame Ukraine now, but, of course, I don‚Äôt rule out cooperation with the Ukrainian GUR at some stage, they behaved too strangely after the terrorist attack. I would like to clarify that it took them 18 minutes from the moment the shooting started and they left. They came in from different directions, blocked the doors, and did everything professionally. And then they drove headlong to no one knows where. It doesn‚Äôt happen that way. We‚Äôre missing something.

                    It is extremely stupid on the part of the Ukrainian intelligence service to invite them to their place after the terrorist attack. This is how you can earn yourself a portion of dehumanization among your new allies. It is much more convenient to hire suicide bombers. Or send them to the border with Kazakhstan. But they purposefully drove to the west of the country. Why? Unclear.

        Listen, I can‚Äôt deny the possibility of the GAE being behind this. My eyes are wide open on their global misdeeds. However, it‚Äôs AT LEAST as likely that the Ukrainians did this on their own.  They‚Äôve grown to be rabid dogs out of control of their handlers in many instances. Heres a few disjointed facts to show this:~We had an article come out a few months ago which talked about the informal rules of the spy game. It was clearly the CIA signaling to the Russians that they were trying to play by the old rules. An attack like this would be a pretty reckless departure. As you said, it could be people like Nuland or MIC people trying to goad Russia.~Another important point is that the West clearly sees the Ukrainians as rabid and untrustworthy. Since the beginning of the war, the west has purposely given the Ukrainians weapons with limited range capabilities so they couldn‚Äôt target Russian civilians on Russia proper.~Budanov, Ukraine‚Äôs intelligence chief, is insane and has also promised to carry out assassinations and killings on Russia‚Äôs soil.~Chechen dissident groups have been spotted on the battlefield on Ukraine‚Äôs side, sometimes sporting ISIS patches. Russia largely drove out the Muslim fundamentalists in their war, and the ones that didn‚Äôt get killed by Russia left to Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan. So Ukrainians certainly have available open lines of communication with these people.With all this being said, the money that the Ukrainians gave these patsies almost certainly came from some of the untold billions of unaccounted dollars that have flowed from the west, so they would have some blood on their hands even if they weren‚Äôt directly involved in the planning.

        Our overlords‚Äô combination of evil and stupidity never ceases to amaze. The same guys who can‚Äôt solve the Nord Stream bombing after 2 years of investigation, have the Moscow attack solved while it‚Äôs happening.
If they were in on it (which now seems likely) silence would have been a much better strategy instead of easily proven lies.
Other than their blind hatred of Russia, I don‚Äôt understand why they would be on it.  To get the Russians to slaughter Ukrainians faster and maybe start WWIII (which we have no hope of winning)?

        The speed at which the ISIS narrative was dismantled was encouraging. Every post on Twitter about it had endless responses along the lines of, ‚Äúoh, you mean that organization that only pops up when the Kagan cult is in power? That Islamic terrorist group that only seems to attack other Muslims and enemies of the US, while apologizing when it attacks Israel by accident?‚Äù This ISIS narrative got destroyed faster than the 40 beheaded babies claim.It might just be a bunch of ‚ÄúMuslims being Muslims‚Äù, as one Bronze Age Pervert (controlled opposition) acolyte said online, but it‚Äôs both reasonable and necessary to be skeptical of the claim. The people in charge of this operation on the NATO side really are thugs and gangsters, and it‚Äôs not like Zelensky‚Äôs people have any compunction about murdering innocent civilians to advance their aims.

I have absolutely no idea who was behind it. But to say that ISIS only attacks Muslims or the enemies of the GAE is just not reality.   While it certainly could have been a GAE-OP, it could have just as easily been Muslims practicing their faith.   Frankly, we will likely never know.

                ‚ÄúMuslims‚Äù and ‚ÄúISIS‚Äù are not the same, though. The ISIS organization plainly is an American and Israeli state-sponsored terror group. I don‚Äôt think they would particularly care now, but US policymakers a decade or so back were afraid of public blowback over genocide of Christians in Syria and Iraq, so ISIS provided the cover for those holocausts.

            This looks nothing like any previous attack by ISIS or similar groups.  They do not plan escape routes, pay their operators, or get take alive.  Maybe it‚Äôs a first.  More likely this was somebody else.

        From the GAE‚Äôs many provocations of Russia, and Russia‚Äôs failure to respond directly, we can conclude that Russia fears the GAE more than the GAE fears Russia. Whether or not either party is justified in their attitude, the truth of it is plain to see. Among dissidents it is fashionable to portray the GAE as a paper tiger, all bark and no bite, but clearly Russia does not share this view. On the other hand, the GAE leadership doesn‚Äôt appear overly worried about Russian retaliation. So either they are delusional/reckless, or as our host suggests, just a rabble of gangsters, or else they know something(s) we don‚Äôt.

            I think the enemies of the GAE would be fine with running out the clock. If, say, China has to take on the GAE, it would rather do it in a decade than now. They and everyone else know that time is running out for it and in many ways the empire is in collapse. Thing is, it can take a very long time and do a lot of damage before it is extinguished.

            There‚Äôs a simple reason for this. Europe is an external province of the GAE from which they can easily stage military operations against Russia. Russia, on the other hand, cannot so easily launch mechanized attacks on the core landmass of the GAE. The GAE has a strong strategic advantage over Russia because of geography and geopolitics.

                If there is any sustained military operation (other than pressing The Button) that the GAE is capable of staging against mainland Russia it is news to me. What are they going to do, land the marines at Arkangel? Send the armor on a blitzkrieg through Belarus? lol. Evidently they can send some drones to attack oil refineries.

First of all, there aren‚Äôt a whole lot of troops to be deployed, but more importantly, the logistics to support them over that continental arc you describe just don‚Äôt exist anymore.Yes, the GAE could deploy troops to Russia, but how many, and to realistically accomplish what, before they are inevitably repulsed?

            Russians are generally very patient and don‚Äôt go off half-cocked on their enemies even when they probably should. Immediate retaliation won‚Äôt happen but when they do it will be epic, I hope anyway.
I think that Russia is being patient because they aren‚Äôt willing to burn the world down unlike the Kagan cult. They‚Äôre showing superhuman patience but surely are beginning to lose it in the face of constant provocations.

            GAE has repeatedly failed to make tritium which is a necessary sparkplug in thermonuclears. It has a half-life of 12 yrs. So every twelve years the ceiling on GAE nukes that don‚Äôt semi fizzle, halves. At the same time the rocket engines on the minuteman missiles, built to last ten years and now going on 50, are showing more cracks while the replacement sentinel ICBMs are lost in the familiar cluster of ‚Äúgovernment programs‚Äù.
I don‚Äôt know if such factors in to decisions to just wait GAE out but maybe they do?

                Tritium is a part of the gas-boost mechanism of the fission primary of a nuclear weapon, the fusing of deuterium and tritium into helium releases extra neutrons which greatly enhance the efficiency of the plutonium-fueled, implosion-assembled fission primaries.  Tritium has a reatively short radioactive half life (12.4 years), but I see that it has been produced by the irradiation of certain rods in commercial light water reactors, and then extracted at the Savannah River Plant.  France recently announced a similar production program using electricty-producing reactors.  There are, of course, serious questions about the reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile, since the weapons now deployed were designed with a service life of about 20 years, but which have been deployed, in some cases for 40 or more years.  And without testing, no one really knows how such weapons will perform.  Russia probably has similar problems, but Russian designs tended to be less complicated, so they may hold up better;  In any event, the probable result in the event of use would be a yield substantially below what the designers expected,, but with nuclear weapons that‚Äôs still a lot of explosive power.

                    Without having looked into it I would imagine the Russians kept more reactors to produce all the ingredients including tritium and plutonium. Judging by artillery shell and tank production facilities the Russians place a lesser premium on profitability and a greater one on spare capacity. Surely the same mentality would apply to the crown jewels of their weapons. So I guess that Russian nukes are more reliable than American, or French, nukes

            Russia does not want Ukraine to turn into another Afghanistan, where they spend a decade bleeding in an asymmetric war that ultimately collapses their government.  Despite some current logistical advantages, long term Russia cannot win an offensive war against NATO without the active participation of China, and my guess is the Chinese are not going along, for now.The ‚ÄúISIS‚Äù cover story may be falling apart, but that was only for western consumption anyway. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if the usual suspects finked on the escape plan, because they wanted the Tajiks caught, so there would be no doubt as to responsibility. They want Russia to react in such a way as will justify NATO intervention, not with the intent of slugging it out, but freezing the conflict, and turning it into a quagmire for Russia.

        The attack in Moscow is yet another confirmation of the existential desperation being felt by the Deep State and their masters. The consequence of losing in Ukraine is an acceleration of the decline of the GAE and the collapse that will ensue when the plates stop spinning. Without the rape of Russian and Ukrainian resources, they cannot continue the charade that the US dollar is anything other than a fiat mirage. They have few options remaining.The Moscow gambit was an attempt to trick the Russians into overreacting and lay the foundation for starting WW3. Only a world war can overt or mask the coming collapse. And all of us plebs are merely bystander witnesses to these machinations. They best we can do at this time is get to a safe haven, ride out the initial chaos, and have a plan for what to do when the fog arrives.

        ‚ÄúWhat we know is that four Tajiks were given weapons that are exceedingly rare on the black market and paid a quarter of a million dollars each to go on a shooting rampage in Moscow and then they fled toward Ukraine.‚Äù
And according to Andrei Martyanov, Russia noticed this, and immediately retaliated by taking out a major power generation facility in Ukraine, turning out the lights in Odessa. (Per the photos, the accuracy was astonishing. Turbines on fire, dam undamaged.)

        Russia will quickly work out who the terrorists are and who supported them, I have no doubt about that. The more important question is why it was allowed to happen in the first place.At the very least, this represents a costly intelligence failure on Russia‚Äôs part, and there needs to be a ruthless internal review to figure out what the hell is going on. It also underscores a point that I have been making basically since Mariupol. Russia really needs to up the operational tempo of this ‚Äúexistential‚Äù war. If Putin would get serious, and pick up the pace, the West would have less time to arrange these little surprises.And what about the Muscovites? We‚Äôre more than two years into this thing, and people are just casually going to concerts in Moscow like it‚Äôs no big deal? Visa overstayers from Tajikistan are allowed to travel to Moscow during a time of war and nobody stops them?This whole thing stinks to high heaven, and not just because of the barbarism of the act or the likelihood of Western involvement. There is still a great reluctance on the part of Russia to fully engage with its situation.

                    I often worder what the Israelis are thinking about as the US and the West in general start to lose our status. I‚Äôm sure that they‚Äôre quite of aware of the situation, but they don‚Äôt really have a lot of alternative options.Jews will never have the kind of control (not even in the same universe) in China, India, SE Asia, Muslim countries or even Russia that they have in the West.I‚Äôm sure that they can see the rest of the world rising, but they can play the ‚ÄúMy fellow Chinese . . .‚Äù card with them. Sure, they can influence, but they‚Äôll remain outsiders, so their influence will be limited.I‚Äôd suspect that this is why they‚Äôve decided that now is the time to push the Palestinians out of Gaza (and maybe even the West Bank). They realize that the clock is running out for them to act with such impunity.

            Interesting how we hear day after day about Putin, the great ‚Äúdictator‚Äù and the 21st century resurrection of Hitler.  But when he runs his country as a relatively benign, open, and free State‚Äîthe exact opposite of the old USSR‚Äîand a terrorist attack occurs, he‚Äôs an incompetent fool for allowing free assembly and not checking everyone‚Äôs ‚Äúpapers‚Äù at every street corner?I would remind everyone, that this same situation happened here with the 9/11 attacks.  I don‚Äôt remember more than a temporary closure of such assemblies‚Äîas is the same now in Russia.  After a couple of weeks, we regained composure and life went on in most areas.Of course, we still have much security theater for the rubes, I suspect Putin will be more intelligent is his adjustment to such future attacks, which are unavoidable in a truly free State.

                        As I‚Äôve said before, my concept of downvote use is not to use it for simple disagreement, but rather outlandish postings.  I rarely downvote, rather I post a rejoinder and state my disagreement.
Pozy, I can‚Äôt remember all our disagreements, but I can remember never downvoting a single comment of yours.  Why, because they are always well stated and well meant.
One really only learns from disagreement.  If you‚Äôre wrong, it may serve to correct you.  If you are right, it will serve to sharpen your argument in future postings.

                Instead of completely reorganizing every little security checkpoint in society, Putin will do what he should do. Find the true people responsible for the attacks, kill them, destroy their organization and warn all of their friends/ethnic cohorts who didn‚Äôt know about the attack that this is what happens to you and your entire organization (which provide for your family both today and in the future) if you mess with Russia.
Putin knows how to deal with mobsters.

        Cui bono? It appears only the Ukes benefit from potential escalatory scenarios here. Recently, the White House is struggling to find the offramp in Gaza and is looking for one in Ukraine, despite the tough talk. The ‚Äúelection‚Äù is coming and the Regime is focused on ‚Äúoptics‚Äù. I think there‚Äôs near zero chance the White House knew anything about this.I agree with Zman that we‚Äôve totally lost control. Everyone knows this and so they are freelancing.That said, we‚Äôve pursued a foreign policy of nonstop provocation against real/perceived/invented ‚Äúfoes‚Äù. Our ‚Äúentangling alliances‚Äù have left us vulnerable to outrageous behavior (Gaza, Moscow attack, French troop deployments etc) by ‚Äúallies‚Äù that we are forced to either tolerate or reinforce after the fact. So a perverse system of rewards has arisen. Should we really be surprised?It‚Äôs a ‚Äúself-licking ice cream cone‚Äù for the MIC though. Provocation, response, more funding, more provocation, escalation‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

            For the Ukraine leadership, the only path that leads to them reaching old age is if the United States gets directly involved in the war and either magically defeats Russia or the Russians choose to avoid WW3 by calling off the advance. The Russian army is advancing on all fronts and they have not even started what everyone expects to be a big offensive this summer. Ukraine is out of men and running low on supplies.This means the Ukrainians will pull out all the stops to get NATO involved, but I suspect maybe this stunt will cause every Western capital to think about where this is headed. America has an open borders. Europe has open borders. Imagine some Jihadis loose in Berlin or Paris with a javelin missile system. Imagine Mexican cartels with Stinger missiles.Time will tell.

                I can‚Äôt imagine that our open borders have not allowed multiple terrorist cells to assemble.  They simply wait upon orders.  The BP here (lower level grunts) have said as much.  They know via whom they‚Äôve already caught attempting to cross the border identified as on the watch list.  For every one of those caught, how many pass undetected?

                Hate to be ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù, but since I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs going to happen anyway, it would be nice if the terrorist acts started happening soon. Now, before the Republicans give away friggin‚Äô everything.Most likely, such events would mostly cluster in cities and suburbs, where it‚Äôs unlikely that anyone has a battle rifle under the seat of his pickup. And, as such, would have a massive death toll, the lawn forcement being busy shooting dogs and arresting people for praying.But taking place in the cities has the positive that the dead are almost to a man opposed to everything the DR wants. Assuming there is a reaction of some sort to avenge the deaths of shitlibs, it will necessarily have to target ISIS-K, or MS-13 or the Bloods or whatever is declared to be the patsy.

I DO imagine they already have them. The CIA has no difficulty procuring hand-held weaponry for their assets. Operation Fast and Furious was just cover for what really is going on at the border.

                I was in a meeting a couple months ago with some high-level, state border patrol folks. The work I do is sort of tangental to border issues. I probably shouldn‚Äôt have even been in there; I am not particularly important.There was a lot of realtalk from those guys and too much to mention in a comment, but I came away convinced that parts of the SW‚Äìmaybe substantial parts‚Äìwill be narco-states within the next decade. No one outright said this, it just seems like the logical outcome to me, given the realities of what was discussed. I also expect significant, domestic Cartel violence in 2024-25, to distract from election shenanigans. The CIA will not be able to put this genie back in the bottle.

        Part of the problem with being a gangster country is no one is really sure who‚Äôs actually in charge. I suppose the people actually in charge know, but that‚Äôs a tiny number of people and nobody really knows who they are.

            It is reasonable to assume no one actually is in charge. Crime families have modi vivendi, but much like law and the Constitution, that‚Äôs just suggestions. There very clearly are pro-China and anti-China factions, for example, and policies change unpredictably as a direct result. The wildest part is the total lack of self-respect on the parts of those who play the roles of senator and representative‚Äìeven crack whores have some sort of red line.

            ‚ÄúPart of the problem with being a gangster country is no one is really sure who‚Äôs actually in charge.‚ÄùI also think the CIA, FBI, Zio-ops, etc. behave more like mafia crime families than governmental agencies or NGOs. Indeed, the politicians themselves can be the target of their actions (this is fairly openly bragged about when it comes to foreign pols, less so when it comes to domestic ones). However, unlikela Cosa Nostrathere is no Mafia Commission. So the poor corrupt politicians can find themselves dodging and weaving as they try desperately to avoid organized hate campaigns, criminal indictments, financial ruin, and possibly worse when the interests of these crime families conflict.

                This really isn‚Äôt a good survival system for them at all. Those bunkers need food, water, and fuel brought in. They need to be serviced and there also needs to be people providing security.
All those vendors and staff members have children, parents, siblings, cousins, and friends who are vulnerable if things go awry, and there are a lot more of them than there are billionaires and their families. Honestly, if the S really does HTF, the billionaires and their families will be the *first* ones to be eaten.

                        The System is their bunker, thus they pitch technocracy as their wunderweapon, and imagine that teeming hordes from the Global South will be their unending supply of support peasants.  They intend to be sheikhs and sultanas.What they don‚Äôt realize is the power of stupid and cruelty in the nonwhites; the talented tenth will be washed away by its own breeder hordes.  There‚Äôs a reason smart niggas flee the hood, squatemalans the barrio, muslims the caliphate, or indians the squalid- and end up with their relatives following them.(Or, why liberals and communists come to hate and flee their own suffocating urban hives, only to be bored stiff by rural tedium.)So the long question is, how long can techno-medievalism last?  Their space efforts might not last any longer than ours, but the tradeoff is that their nuclear weapons, biolabs, transport, and surplus populations won‚Äôt either.I see that as the stilted, stable equilibrium that the gaia or the yahweh is trying to return to.The bestial is bound by its own limits absent the Whites.  We are the sugar in the petri dish.

                        No, I take my reply back.  It is too long term to be at all practical, and somewhat disheartening and defeatist.  Screw accuracy.Honestly, ask yourself- if the Whites go away, will any of us give a flying f**k about God‚Äôs plans for the world, or the fate of mankind?Frank Herbert said it best; religion is part of the human social ecology.  I see belief as a condition of that dynamic at work, just as heat is a condition of an engine at work.The culling will occur, as it must, but despite our our own private failures, let us leave what we can to inform those who follow us‚Ä¶that their armor might be adamantine.

Bracken‚Äôs most recent comment about what will happen with the gibs was on a podcast with Kunstler:
https://kunstler.com/podcast/kunstlercast-397-matt-bracken-navy-seal-views-the-field-of-operations/
He‚Äôs consistently on LTC Steven Murray‚Äôs roundtables on Rumble. It‚Äôs kind of funny how he dominates the three or four colonels that are typically on with him.

Also, the Kunstler podcast is notable because they do touch on the JQ, and Kunstler does admit all is not well on that front.

How many cautionary red lines has the West crossed re Ukraine since it started? A lot. Now F-16s are an of course despite being nuclear capable and the Russians can‚Äôt tell if they are carrying nukes until the plane is down. We‚Äôre now onto Western soldiers officially in Ukraine. And possibly to totally barbaric attacks on Russian civilians. Can you imagine the pressure on Putin to do something to catch their attention?? I think something big will happen on our side of the fence

‚ÄúHe will probably end up doing something like that.‚Äù
Exactly. I‚Äôve long thought the SJW‚Äôs, by way of example, will continue to terrorize people until they are met with violence, upon which they will promptly disintegrate. A preview of that was the Rittenhouse affair. Sane people never want to push the red button until they are forced to do so. The United States is a dead letter now, in no small part because of that natural hesitancy.

                        Jack, because of the mental children with nukes aspect, this could go sideways all the way and none of us are sure to survive this.

                        @Moran:Agreed and I‚Äôve expected it to go sideways since the outset. What easily could have represented red lines have been crossed many times. The lack of response has made the crazed children even more reckless and provocative. Big Western cities with complex systems and vulnerable infrastructure could turn into hellscapes overnight. As an aside, if we somehow make it through this without things going kinetic, mass migration and the general dumbing down of the populace still will remain in place and have to be considered as to long-term plans.If Putin or Lavrov or Shoigu issue a public warning to us, obviously it has to be taken seriously. The odds are, though, there will be no advance notice if revenge is extracted. It is a truly dangerous moment.

        ‚Äù It is not as if the political class ever had tight control of foreign policy. Maybe now they no longer have any control over what happens in their name.‚ÄùNo doubt. Increasingly it seems the National Security State not only is fully in charge, but doesn‚Äôt care who knows it. Stories pop up and disappear from time to time about blatant, once unthinkable involvement of the intelligence services in domestic politics. That may have been the case a long time, but there is little doubt now the political actors and actresses simply read and follow scripts in Our Democracy. There also have been indications that spooks and their corporate sponsors may be lining their pockets, too, which is the hallmark of a standard gangster state.As for Tajikistan, if memory serves, it is second only to Israel in influence peddling and so forth. That‚Äôs pretty impressive for a nation-state that has the GDP of a mid-cap. It also seems to be a lot of money being laundered through there. Maybe it is the new Ukraine for Western politicians and their masters. It was quite interesting that the Banana Empire along with the Israelis and Turks has been quite willing to help ethnically cleanse the Armenians from there. Investment opportunities abound, apparently.Finally, this is dangerous beyond belief. The entire Ukraine cluster has threatened the world with nuclear annihilation since February 2022. If the Russians establish an absolute link in this case, 9/11 boom-boom sounds may be heard in D.C. or NYC after some sketchy Venezuelan or whatever extracts revenge for sanctions or some other motive listed in an easily found manifesto, which will be made public immediately unless he is a tranny. Let‚Äôs hope the National Security State is greedier than it is crazy if that happens, but that may not be the way to bet on Clown World.

            One of Kennan‚Äôs last speeches detailed the dangers of Ukraine independence and warned against Western involvement there. It was of course ignored. Interestingly, the current CIA director previously was ambassador to Moscow and agreed fully with Kennan. Must want a second house or something.

        I‚Äôd like to see some better evidence here, how were the weapons rare? The video I saw looked like they had at least one spray painted AK pattern rifle with only iron sights. Islamists attacking public venues isn‚Äôt anything new. When Islamists misbehave somewhere in the world, it‚Äôs not necessarily some sort of Mossad / CIA / MI6 conspiracy but rather them doing what they do. ISIS-K has made sudden appearances in the Western press before, I recall the first time hearing of them was during the Afghanistan withdrawal debacle.Russian FSB recently neutralized a separate ISIS-K operation in Russia,https://www.dw.com/en/russia-says-it-thwarted-planned-attack-on-synagogue/a-68463018

            Putin is admitting it was Islamists now. Why did we (US Embassy) post public warnings if we were behind it? I think we warned Russia, they either refused to listen or couldn‚Äôt detect the threat. Much like 9/11, when they (and Israel, France, UK) warned us an attack was imminent but we didn‚Äôt or couldn‚Äôt prevent it.

            Just so.  The first time I heard of ‚ÄúISIS-K‚Äù was as a group that carried out attacks on Americans in Afghanistan during Joe Chi Minh‚Äôs botched withdrawal two and a half years ago.Likewise, it‚Äôs hardly surprising to see the Usual Suspects doing this kind of thing during Bombathon, I mean, Ramadan. It is a pattern that‚Äôs hard to ignore.Yes, ISIS was 100% a US creation.  ISIS was the ‚Äúdemocratic Syrian resistance‚Äù when their representatives were in Washington begging for guns and money twelve years ago, which a certain feckless Kenyan and his party were only too happy to provide‚Äìsee also, Operation TIMBER SYCAMORE‚Äìbut magically transmogrified themselves into the Islamic State In Syria when they took and held ground.  The line from there to here is not altogether clear, though, and it‚Äôs not like this isn‚Äôt exactly the kind of thing Moslems really, really like to do even when a superpower isn‚Äôt funding them.

        In hindsight, Z ‚Äì we all shoulda seen this one coming.Throughout this fiasco all we have ever done is escalate, bluff and double down. There‚Äôs no room to do that anymore. Fwance will not send their men in as they are in no condition to take on Russia. None of the other players will back them, their militaries are in even worse shape. For its part, the US is out of ammunition and has a shrinking, increasingly dysfunctional military. We are out of ammunition, defeat is now assured. How do you escalate when you can‚Äôt escalate? Nukes are out, as the Russians have those and would light up Washington first. 4th Generation Warfare is the only option. It allows the continued use of proxies too.It‚Äôs possible we are going to see a dramatic spike in domestic terrorism soon. And you can bet there will be no evidence to infer Russian involvement either. Globohomo is playing a very dangerous game with opponents they have no clue about. They will soon. When you get into squad and platoon level tactics, not even the oligarchs are safe.This has gotten much more interesting. But‚Ä¶who knows what Putler will do? The guy is a chess master and brinksmanship is his game. This has all certainly gotten more interesting.

                I wonder, TT?Consider: when they were caught, the authorities cut of ears and wired up their balls to car batteries. I wouldn‚Äôt be at all surprised if their bodies aren‚Äôt being fed to the incinerators today. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the reprisals have been greenlighted too. Families? Friends? The Russian Bear may choose to make a statement to the associates of the perps and warn the others.In contrast, we catch terrorists and put them up in luxurious accomodations with three full meals a day. When they sue us for brutality and suffering, we pay them millions of dollars in settlements.Terrorism works on us because we let it. Will Putler?

        If the gay american global empire‚Äôs grubby fingerprints aren‚Äôt all over this (hard to believe), then who‚Äôs are and what are the Russians going to do about it?  There‚Äôs no doubt the US bureaucratic governmental blob is far more corrupt, ‚Äúdiverse‚Äù and stupid than in recent memory, but that doesn‚Äôt mean there aren‚Äôt plenty of evil, scheming, intelligent bastards and bastardettes planning nefarious ends.  The wonder is that this system hasn‚Äôt yet come crashing down, either financially or in totality, yet.

            When the videos were posted I got a mental taste of what it‚Äôs like to be a powerless Ukrainian and to live under a corrupt government that hates your guts and performs endless atrocities in your name.

            What are the Russians saying about it?  It‚Äôs not like Muslims killing civilians seemingly without reason is a rare event.  I‚Äôm pretty sure this has happened in Russia in recent times, but before the war.  Russia, and Moscow in particular has a pretty big Muslim minority who like to shut down parts of Moscow during Friday prayers.While it certainly would not surprise me if the GAE was behind it or sponsored it in some way, it would also be no surprise to find out it was just Muslims being Muslim.I‚Äôll be more convinced when/if the Kremlin gives their explanation.  OTOH, it‚Äôs not like they don‚Äôt have their own incentives to use the attack for political purposes and blame GAE or Kiev even if they aren‚Äôt responsible.

                The Blackberry Fruitcake Empire, the global engine of the sort of depravity and perversity most anathema to the Muzz (not to mention its perpetual trespass in the Ummah), would seem to be an eminently more desirable target for them than traditionally moral Mother Russia. No, it‚Äôs not impossible that the Moscow attack was another instance of wanton Islamic terrorism, but given the litany of far more appealing targets for them, it seems unlikely.

                    Wasn‚Äôt it Russia who saved Assad and help drive ISIS from the area?  This is why Clinton wanted to start WW3 by imposing a ‚Äúno-fly-zone‚Äù over parts of Syria occupied by ISIS.Everyone is so quick to blame the GAE. Right now, nobody knows anything.  GAE is claiming they warned Russia, Russia says they were never warned.  Though, I do remember hearing the warnings a week or so ago.Why not just fund pro Western terrorists or something? Why use foreign Muslims?  There are plenty of Western stooges in Russia, many of whom are on SSRIs or are otherwise mentally unstable.  It would have been pretty funny to drag  ‚ÄúPussy Riot‚Äù back out and have one of them do it, doubly funny if they were naked.  The timing seems a bit suspect for the GAE.  Doing it before the election would have caused a lot more chaos.

            The degeneracy is not about blackmail so much as it is part of a general debasement that makes them amenable to corrupt influences. Whatever sexual perversions they practice are widely celebrated nowadays. The real source of blackmail is the normal things people do which influencers and the media can turn into manufactured outrage. Like what they did to Taylor Swift to coerce her into being an overt shitlib; like what they do to anyone who comes to their attention with rational politics. You may have had some personal experience with this, Xman. Then, if the targets don‚Äôt take their lead from that, and they‚Äôre in a position to effect real change, active services (antifa, three-letter-agancies, Zio-operatives, etc.) have six ways from Sunday to rat-fuck them.

                Threats of violence replaced blackmail long ago. Z used the term ‚Äúgangster state,‚Äù and while that is accurate, the United States also bears an eerie resemblance to Nicaragua in the immediate aftermath of the Sandinista revolution. Managua really didn‚Äôt have to use its own forces and mostly let its political supporters terrorize dissidents and troublesome folks. That is what happens here now.As an aside but related, one of the parties to the Nicaraguan revolution was the widow of the publisher of LA PRENSA, Violetta Chamorro, and she was terrorized daily and her newspaper shut down from time to time, i.e., canceled. Western ‚Äújournalists‚Äù uttered not a peep of support for her. Same as it ever was‚Ä¶

                    Taylor Swift comes from the upper middle class. Typical normie-Republican turf. She got started in country music, whose fans are not exactly flaming liberals. As a young woman I doubt she herself was all that political‚Äîit certainly didn‚Äôt play any role in her work. She just didn‚Äôt talk about it. That was simply unacceptable to the usual suspects. They organized a hate campaign against her ‚Äútroubling silence‚Äù on the usual bogeymen.Only someone who‚Äôs experienced this for the first time themselves can appreciate how truly terrifying it is. The normal assumption would be it‚Äôs organic and you must have done something horribly wrong to deserve it. Reputational experts came forward to help repair her tarnished reputation‚Äîright out of the same crowd that slandered her in the first place. Now Taylor is mouthing the same shitlib stuff as the rest of them.

        I saw photos of one of the suspects‚Äî sitting in one of those curious glass cubes the Russians have in their courtrooms for arraignments‚Äîand immediately pegged him as a patsy. The vacant cast to the eyes, the ungroomed monobrow. In a world free of schemers, that guy would be cutting shawarma into pita bread in his peddler‚Äôs cart, or whistling as he drove a gypsy cab through some small Tajikistani town. He‚Äôs not quite an autistic recruited by the CIA over the internet, but he‚Äôs no mastermind. Someone definitely put him up to it.Was this maybe Ms. Nuland‚Äôs ‚Äúgoodbye gift‚Äù to her historical enemy on her way out? Hey, some people get fired and steal office supplies, maybe take a printer if they‚Äôre really pissed. For neocons it‚Äôs much harder to satiate the anger. Gotta kill at least a couple hundred muzzies or Slavs just to blow off a head of steam.Recently my Door Dash orders have been getting fulfilled by guys with a lot ‚Äú-Dov‚Äù and ‚Äú-Nov‚Äù and ‚Äú-Aev‚Äù suffixes in their last names. I recognized these names from boxing, and asked one where he was from. ‚ÄúTajikistan,‚Äù he said. Isn‚Äôt that wonderful? Maybe the progs are right when they talk about open borders meaning more enhanced culinary options. I‚Äôm looking forward to them opening a Haitian barbecue joint around here soon.

            I have noticed the guys from the Stans too. Lots of cabbies are now from that part of the world. The Marathon bombers were from that part of the world and thy had family connections to the CIA. As part of the project to destabilize Russia, our CIA has been in that part of the world for a long time now, so the usual suspects have ready access to men willing to commit acts of terrorism.

        We live in a surprisingly safe world. American officials rain death upon a dozen countries around the world and there is no blowback. This suggests the world sees U.S. hegemony as natural and acceptable. There is a symbiotic relationship between U.S. interests and world needs. It amounts to a push-pull scenario. All those foreign students going to school at U.S. colleges shows how desirable the culture remains to this day.

            The glimpses we get of the shadow realm are the things ‚Äúmedia people‚Äù consider normal to do‚Äîso normal they let us see that they all do them‚Äîthat are in fact very strange.The ritual pilgrimage to Israel is /our/ standard example. Adopting African kids (and now trooning them out) is a classic. They donate money to politicians. Seems like a small thing, but before ‚ÄúBrexit &amp;Trump,‚Äù almost no normal people ever voluntarily did that. They borrow each other‚Äôs houses! Think how odd that really is‚Äîhow it would change what your house is, damage your concept/feeling of home. Etc.We could make a long list, see in it the contours of a life wholly unlike ours, and from that perhaps deduce the ‚Äúreal rules.‚Äù I think what would prevent us from deducing them correctly is that we have too expansive a view of the political. Politics is only *what they do to us*. In their world it‚Äôs not a thing.A possibility: The West‚Äôs ruling class mass insanity since ~2016 is their reaction to the people *inflicting politics on them* (they think).

        Jumping out and saying it was ISIS, with no evidence, before the bodies were even cold is such a diplomatic fail it boggles the mind. Even if American proxies did it, a reasonable country would send its condolences, condemn the attack in the strongest terms possible, and conduct an investigation for a few weeks to build evidence for whatever patsy you want to frame for the attack.
The hyper-media cycle has really fried these people‚Äôs brains, to the extent they just react ,and never bother to sit down and think strategically long-term.

            ISIS is the Covid of 10 years ago. Everyone remembers ‚ÄúISIS‚Äù because it‚Äôs got a zippy name and they were the big bad thing that was going to wreck the world. Our rulers were just reaching for something in the recent past to do a remake and get the eyeballs of rubes, like Hollywoood producers have no imagination anymore and just do Ghostbusters remakes every few years.
Might as well blame muh terrorisms on the PLO or the Sandinistas while you‚Äôre at it.

        ‚ÄúThis Ukraine fiasco suggests that America is falling into gangsterism. Powerful players no longer care what elected officials say or think as they conduct their private agendas.‚Äù
Couldn‚Äôt agree with you more. This particularly holds for the Biden White House, since its occupant was installed solely to be a mouthpiece for the ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù and MIC. But it has also held for earlier administrations, perhaps since the assassination of JFK.

Agreed, and I will add that this thorough decoupling of power from authority (‚Äúelected officials‚Äù) is the defining trait that separates liberal democracy from other manifestations of democracy like what is practiced in Russia and Iran.
