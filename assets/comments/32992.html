        One aspect of managerialism that gets overlooked is Madison Avenue’s role. Yes, managerialism refers to the layer of management between workers and owners, and also to trying to rationalize the exertions of everything from ladies at switchboards to men on assembly lines. But there is also the Marshall McLuhan aspect of things, the management of the human mind through media. It’s still with us today in “nudging,” the “push polls,” and social proof of everything from celebrity endorsements of candidates to “Fifty Intelligence Agents Say the Hunter Biden Laptop is Russian Disinformation.”Because the agenda of the elites is so unpopular with the people, the people need to be given the sense that they’re the odd man out. Yes, your neighbor agrees with you, but when you look around, at newsstands or TV shows or in magazines, it seems like everyone else is in favor of this thing. Regardless of what people say, no one likes to feel weird, isolated—which is why the Tim Walz “weirdo Hail Mary” against Vance, while unsuccessful, was used. And it takes a lot of skill and knowledge of psyops to make it seem like the majority (an electoral majority this time) is some weird minority.This was very much a part of the mobilization for both the First and Second World Wars. They retconned the Great War to make it look like only Eugene Debbs and some weirdos (that word again) were against it, but it took a lot of mental massaging and mind raping to get people on board. And while this wasn’t quite as hard in World War II, it was still a task, and it wasn’t just brownshirts in little underground American Bund organizations (alienated sort of Matt Heimbach/Stormfront types) who weren’t interested in the War.Someone (I forget who) had this insight about the real danger of the New Deal. For most of history people worried about their bodies, feeding them, clothing them, and keeping them from getting mangled so they could remain serviceable for work. Once the government came in and said, “We’ll give you enough to at least live, regardless—even if you’re a bum—and compensate you if you get hurt,” a lot of people were skeptical. It sounded like a free lunch, but once the body was no longer the locus, the state really started to concentrate on the mind and soul. Yes, the “Great Awakening” and all kinds of crazy Quaker movements were always vying for the soul of the nation, but this is when it became the State’s goal (its duty in its mind) to manage your very being.That’s another thing that pisses them off about Trump; he’s earthy—he cares about the price of eggs and gas. He’s not interested in what anyone thinks or feels; that’s their business. But what are the price of eggs and gas when we’re supposed to be worried about white supremacy? These empty people—bugmen, cat ladies, etc.—don’t look to the state to fill potholes; they look to the state to fill the hole in their soul.

            Ah yes, the old adage “what will it take to fill that hole where Daddy didn’t praise you enough or Mommy didn’t love you enough”. How much is enough? How many trophy wives, public awards/accolades, 3rd yachts, most toys etc? Thinking up new rules to punish people with won’t fill the hole.

            “It’s still with us today in “nudging,” the “push polls,” and social proof of everything from celebrity endorsements of candidates to “Fifty Intelligence Agents Say the Hunter Biden Laptop is Russian Disinformation.””
We have been propagandized every single day of our lives.  We are absolutely awash in propaganda.   It starts from a very young age.  It saturates all media.  A large part of education is propaganda.
The Soviet propagandists were absolute amateurs in comparison to American propagandists.

                I strongly suspect the Power Structure’s propaganda blueprint was initially developed for use against the Germans in the aftermath of WWII. It was further refined in the 50s and early 60s and put into full effect thereafter.

                    MKUltra, via Operation Paperclip, was largely based on German innovations. Brain-washing, or alchemical processing, Edward Hunter deals with regarding Chinese innovations.

                    And Paul Gottfried, among others, showed that some of the denazification efforts after WWII contributed towards the crazed “antifascism” that developed into Woke, Antifa, etc.
Some of the denazification can be justified, but some of it went into “collective guilt” of all Germans.  That has strong similarities to what we now see, with collective guilt pushed against Whites.  I think there were other influences that date from before WWII, but after 1945 this stuff steadily increased, it seems.

                        We forget it wasn’t just German-Germans who got imported.We were the second largest recipient of that missing 6 million after the USSR. They happen to be uniquely interested in mind games, narratives, and passive-aggressive assault.
Later edit: My bigotry is speaking again. If I were German-German a little revenge and retribution might just be the ticket.

                            I’ve always said, a huge part of the problem began with the wave of (((immigrants))) from eastern Europe in the late-19th Century.  With that came violent anarchism and all kinds of other lasting problems.  And then there was another wave, including Frankfurt School panjandrums, before WWII.

                    I’d guess the ‘talent’ largely was imported.
Not everybody brought to the U.S. under Operation Paperclip was a rocket scientist like von Braun.  Some, certainly, were intel-propagandists because the Nazi Regime was very good at theatre and propaganda.  Cutting-edge.
In the U.S. boys, especially, are heavily browbeaten and propagandized K-university, overwhelmingly by leftist women whose passion and self-righteousness make Goebbels look like a piker.

                Boomercon has every reason—so far—to think so.  Stock market at all time highs, Fed’s again reduce interest rate. Wars likely to be ended. However, this is simply “irrational exuberance” as the cliche goes.  The economy is sick and there is every reason to believe in a second surge of inflation a few months down the road (2025).  The real rich are moving into commodities to hedge.

                    Yes.  As for the market, it is not indicative of general economic health.
The number of homeless men on the streets, however, is very indicative of general economic health, and of national policy in toto.
None of the underlying problems that doom the economy has even been addressed, much less resolved.

                Boomercon has every reason—so far—to think so. Stock market at all time highs, Fed’s again reduce interest rate. Wars likely to be ended. However, this is simply “irrational exuberance” as the cliche goes. The economy is sick and there is every reason to believe in a second surge of inflation a few months down the road (2025). The real rich are moving into commodities to hedge.

                “…ships full of Nazis off the East Coast.”Nah, the NAZI’s fled to the dark side of the moon and set up base.To all I highly recommend the movie “Iron Sky”:”Iron Sky (2012). This satirical sci-fi film follows a storyline in which a group of Nazis escaped to the Moon at the end of World War II and established a secret base on its dark side. Decades later, in the year 2018, they prepare to return to Earth to launch a renewed offensive.”The movie is a hoot and quite creative.  So much so that it spawned a sequel “Iron Sky: The Coming Race“with NAZI’s riding dinosaurs.  🙂

        The democrap playbook is replete with plays that only work once. They borked Robert Bork but that play / ploy never worked again. They impeached Trump twice, neither got the desired (by the left) result. The entire progressive project is crashed now, all that will remain are embarrassing rear guard skirmishes. The core of the American electorate has decided sanity works, even if sold in a not quite sane wrapper. Watch for truly bizarre leftist escapades coming to a town near you.

            If you look at what the left has been up to since 2017 politically, it’s actually pretty stunning. The Russia Hoax. The #resistance. The COVID lockdown hoax. The BLM riots. The color revolution. Stealing a Presidential election. The internet censorship regime. The lawfare they rolled out against Trump and his supporters. The coup against their own sitting President. This is without going into their disastrous policy failures and incompetence. Yet what did all of that end up with? Trump winning an election at a far greater margin than he did in 2016. The sort of people who delivered Indiana to Obama in 2008 will never vote for a Democrat again. Elon Musk is now a political force in American politics. Trust in the institutions they used against Trump is at an all-time low. There’s lots along these lines and it’s also something that they will never talk about because their failure is so total. Does that mean they are going away, of course not. But whatever comes next is likely to be even more nutty, unhinged, and incompetent than what we have seen.

The Iron Law of the Left states that no matter how much they wind the mainspring of lunacy, they can always manage a few more turns of the crown. And when that sumbitch finally breaks as it inevitably will, all hell is gonna break loose.

                Trump is a victim of timing. Had he come along in 1988, or 1968, he would have been an eccentric but nothing more. When he did come along – 2015 – the Authoritarian Left and their sensibilities were in almost total control.Imagine a well-known Russian merchant bursting into Moscow, say, 1923, and calling out Communism. Making both the conservative and revolutionary elements stumble for their диваны. And then getting popular support for being “rude”, and then he becomes mayor of Moscow.What I’m saying is Trump, hopefully, has broken and diffused the Authoritarian Left before it had a chance to enjoy its 70 years of Marxist dominance. It had 10, maybe 11 years, which gifted us the wonderful memories of Trayvon, all those dindu deaths, fake nooses, shouty wammen, censorship, doxing, FBI raids, Covid, sleepy Joe, neocon wars. Imagine what another 59 years would’ve brought!

                    I’m sure The Precious would like to run another shadow presidency out of his DC house. The question is, do they want to follow him anymore? Ditto for the stranglehold that the Clintonistas have had over much of the managerial state. The foot soldiers are still there, but they might be looking for new leadership now. If they have any sense. Questionable.

                        I was thinking about that too. This entire election is totally, 100% on the DC elites starting with Obama. They are the ones who engineered this coup to get rid of Joe. Now, it seems like Joe outmaneuvered them by endorsing Kamala before they got a chance to push someone else (Big Mike, Newsom, whoever). Now maybe Joe would have still lost to Trump, but they wanted to get rid of him and they got rid of him and this is what they get. So, are these the people that are still going to run the show? Lefties are going to fight Trump for sure, starting in the media – they’ve already started – but I wouldn’t be surprised if they are totally rudderless.Not to mention that this whole operation has been so out of control and incompetent that people are now looking at the 2020 election numbers and realizing taht, well, maybe this wasn’t the most secure election in history. They do not have a good answer for these numbers, because there is no good answer. . I wouldn’t be surprised if this picks up steam, and I hope it does.

                            The numbers are going to look less suspicious once the California votes are all counted. For reasons I don’t understand they are unable or unwilling to count votes in a timely manner out there. Something about allowing two weeks (!) after election day for the mail in ballots to come in before they are counted.

                    We are 90 years into our customized version of Marxist-Leninism. Some of the elite has gone rogue over legitimate fear their gibs and lives also were under threat. Does that mean much? Certainly, but these are not our people simply because they are not antagonistic. Some interests will dovetail, though.If Harris had won or, to be precise, had been allowed to win, yeah, the Left would have gone balls to the wall. The faction who used her as a puppet has been checked somewhat. Trump has announced he will sign an executive order to end government censorship and mass surveillance. I doubt it ends, but that shows what had the rogue elite concerned.

                The election results do have some real white pills in them. I saw a graph showing that the greatest shifts in Trump’s favor occurred in the hard blue states. The only exceptions were FL and I think Mississippi. Those exceptions were probably due to conservative refugees from the Blue states moving in. The movements in the blue states can be interpreted as reactions against the authoritarian Covid measures and the St. Floyd riots.

            I just roared with laughter the other day when Trump’s attorneys told Letitia James to cut the BS lawfare “or they’d throw her fat ass in jail”.Say what you want about the old school Madmen… but they knew how to deal with shitty women. Upon thinking about it…that might even work as an alternate hypothesis?Consider: the “proto-managerial class” worked and worked well for 40 years. What changed? The influx of women that began in the 50s and turned into a torrent in the 60s and 70s. Admin and clerical departments exploded, with armies of women doing fake busy-work. When they captured HR – much of corporate America saw the writing on the wall. Those that didn’t were beer companies that were astonished when troons tried to pitch beer to dirt people and boycotts resulted. Razor companies astonished to find that men didn’t appreciate being accused of rape… People forget that Twitter was on the ropes before Elon arrived, and that it was largely run by women and soys. Low women thrive on gossip, character assassination, and bitching. Perhaps this is the Achilles heel of the managerial class?The conservatives could learn a thing or two in this regard as well. Contentious women are depicted in the bible as ungodly for very valid reasons…Excellent show, BTW.

                Filthie, I was just about to post how the decline of the managerial state coincides with its takeover by women, when I saw your post. The male dominated managerial state that took down the Kennedy brothers was hard as nails.

                    Everything women take over turns to shit. The only exceptions are things that leverage their traditional skills. Sometimes they even manage to f@ck that up. Take school teachers. They’ve morphed from nurturing young people to become productive and responsible adults toundermining parents andinducting kids into Leftist cults like BLM and trannyism.

                Hmmmppfffffff. The more I think about it…
First they ran Cankles against Trump and were SURE she’d beat him. They learned nothing from the experience. Then they doubled down and ran Cackles against him expecting a different result. Only hormonal women (and a few soys) could be this stupid.
Could this odd change of political climate be the gynocracy reassessing their survival options?
But whadda I know?

                    I actually used to have a great deal of respect for Lynne Cheney. Very sharp lady and a merciless debater. I saw her disembowel several Leftist profs on the old McNeil Lehrer News Hour back in the 90s.

                    I believe it was “go fuck yourself”. I didn’t exactly like Cheney even then but it made me like him a bit just for that. Of course, nowadays he’s gone completely over to the Dark Side.

The corporations openly brag that they won’t hire any Evil White Males.  Guess who pushes that line?That is exactly what changed, though folks will do anything to keep from admitting it.  Empowered women ARE the ‘deep state’.  Even the VA clinics are dominated by them.I watched the U.S. transform from a functional, largely masculine nation to a totalitarian feminist nation.  How’s rule-by-princess been workin’ out for ya?

                I saw that process happen first-hand at one of my employers.  When I started there ca. 2000, the “personnel” guy was sensible, competent, no-nonsense, a Vietnam veteran, and he seemed to understand people.  He was replaced a few years later by a feminist, middle-aged woman, and of course the department name changed to Human Resources.  Not long after, by expressing an un-PC opinion, I ended up being suspended and then a few years later was put on the next list of “layoffs,” after battling with the passive-aggressive efforts of the HR woman and her allies.

                    Just a question for the group as a whole.  Has anyone had an encounter/interaction/employment with an HR department that wasn’t staffed primarily by women?
I never had, but assumed it’s because of university background, but seems it’s everywhere when one read discussion in this group.

                        My experience, working full-time since the mid-1980’s, has been that there always tended to be a large percentage of females in personnel/HR departments, but the percentage increased over time.  And, as in the experience I described above, the HR managers tended to change from male to female.
You could say I’ve had a checkered career–I’ve worked in academia, government, and the private sector.  I’ve been mostly in academia, and what might be called academic-adjacent employers such as museums.  From what I’ve seen, though, corporations and government HR departments also tend to be very heavily female, especially in recent decades.

                        Yes.  I also might add that, at the same employer where I had that run-in with HR, a lesbian was hired as the Power-Behind-the-Throne of the CEO.  She worked very aggressively with the feminist HR manager to bring in fellow LGBT people.  It ended up being like a cult–they continually hired those of various bent persuasions, and  were aggressive in their various LGBT programs that they pushed.
Not coincidentally, they ran the institution financially into the ground.  And the lesbian Power-Behind-the-Throne left to spread her destruction somewhere else.

                            A common tragedy these days, 1660.  During my Career Phase, I repeatedly observed that when a female became a department head, she invariably hired only females thereafter . . . it’s like they operate as a Guild or something.
American men are very naive concerning female nature. It may well cost them their country and their civilization.

                As I remember there was an unusual aspect to the Thomas hearings—Senator Danforth.  Danforth *literally* sat at Thomas’ side during such hearings as guide and mentor.  Note, that slimeball Biden was head of the Judiciary Committee.  I think Danforth sitting by Thomas’ side did the trick of keeping the Committee from successfully Borking Thomas—which was the plan all along.Aside, all I ever needed to know about Biden was in his questioning of Thomas.  During such, he ask Thomas (with all the faux emotion he could muster) whether Thomas—after his hostile treatment by *Biden’s* uncontrolled Committee—whether Thomas could now do his job of SCOTUS in an unbiased manner!The mendacity of Biden is fresh in my mind til this day…

                Given Thomas’s advanced age, I hope he goes to the Trump team very soon and asks to see their short list of possible replacements should he retire.  And I hope he’s very clear about not seeing a single name that’s been promoted by a “conservative” DC think tank.  If the list only contains the likes of John Roberts or Neil Gorsuch then he tells them, “Piss off, I’ll die on the bench like RBG.  Let’s just hope that doesn’t happen during a Democratic administration!”

I think that is a fair reward for all the lives his money drop destroyed during the past four years. On top of that, his pollution of the 2020 electoral process has brought the world to the brink of WW3 and nuclear holocaust.

                Any style of electionfortificationis, on its face, “conspiracy against rights.” If even one federal prosecutor were an ethical/Constitutional actor, Zuck would already be facing serious time. Of course that’s unimaginable.
And it wouldn’t help at all. To make any possibly positive difference, Zuckerberg, everyone named Zuckerberg (just in case), and everyone who’s ever taken a check from “Meta” would have to be piled in a ditch.
That’s before lunch on day one. We’re working backwards through the alphabet.

        For a great breakdown of the Nixon coup, go read/listen to Geoff Shepard. He was a young law intern fresh out of law school (he also wasn’t Ivy League and was a Midwest guy if I remember correctly) and was on the policy side in the Nixon administration.  Tucker had him on and gave a great summary of events in that. He also wrote books and has a new documentary out that summarizes his work. The amount of shenanigans the democrats pulled was astonishing. He also drew the strong parallels between Trump and what Nixon went through. He’s a great speaker, well worth the listen.

            Yes, and he tells lots of interesting details about the DC Swamp in general. For example, how Bob Woodward suspiciously got his position at the Washington Post, and basically stays powerful through extortion.
There’s an interesting Chronicles overview by Shepard about Watergate….https://chroniclesmagazine.org/view/the-watergate-show-trial/
And his interview with Tucker Carlson was good. Carlson has been hitting lots of home runs lately with interviews!

        One of the first measures of whether or not the GOP has embraced Seriousness will be if they launch Congressional investigations into election discrepancies in 2020 compared to 2016 and 2024. 2020 is such an anomaly and sticks out like a sore thumb as the Zman said. The Democrats and the mainstream media (but I repeat myself) will shriek and rant about it, but I think Trump’s winning the popular vote as well as the EC will give the GOP Congress Critters enough cover to do it if they have the stones to do it.

            Comparison to Hitler or NAZI’s is a tell of sorts.  The person stating such is an ignorant emotional.  No one worth listening to.

                    Like the vast majority of pathologies that afflict us, Hitleritis first began appearing with some regularity in the 60s. Rod Serling dispersed a good bit of it in the Twilight Zone.

                        “The Obsolete Man” was one of the best, most eloquent polemics against tyranny and totalitarianism to ever to appear on television though.You walk into this room at your own risk, because it leads to the future, not a future that will be but one that might be. This is not a new world, it is simply an extension of what began in the old one. It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time. It has refinements, technological advances, and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom. But like every one of the super-states that preceded it, it has one iron rule: logic is an enemy and truth is a menace. – This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth, in his last forty-eight hours on Earth. He’s a citizen of the State but will soon have to be eliminated, because he’s built out of flesh and because he has a mind. Mr. Romney Wordsworth, who will draw his last breaths – in The Twilight Zone.The episode is all the more effective because it could apply to any dictatorship — Stalinist, Hitlerian, or other.

                            Oh, no question about it. In fact, “The Obsolete Man” is my second-favorite TZ episode.
Hard to bowl any clear-cut ideology from TZ though because the episodes are all at sixes and sevens. That said, overall one can detect a faint whiff of libertarianism.

Under Jewish religious law, Goldwater would not be considered Jewish as that passes down through the mother.  You may judge the “genetics” as you like.  Here in the West, such aspect of Goldwater I never heard of as an issue while I lived in AZ.

        That Republican have made limited inroads among latino voters is unsurprising. To use the language of woke, Latin America is more “diverse” than the United States—at least as it was historically. Republican pundits who assume latinos will eventually vote like thecriollolandowners from Castro’s Cuba or that they are natural conservatives based on a Catholic faith (ignoring Liberation theology) are clearly delusional. But if we factor in racial and other factors we can arrive at a better understanding of their voting behavior.But there are big differences. In Latin America acting white is viewed as aspirational, not derogatorily as it is among American blacks. Latinos who think white—not only Europeans butcastizoswho we may not see as such—will often vote for the right. Also, people aregenerallymore relaxed about race than in America. I’ve seen an acquaintance greeted with “¡Hola, negro!” respond with a silly smile rather than anger. So race hustling by the left may not invariably work as well as it does with, say, American blacks.

            Even black voters, particularly black men, are starting to become more based and are moving to the right.  Trump in 2024, got a higher percentage of the black vote as a Republican presidential candidate, since Richard Nixon in 1960 (Nixon got nearly a third of the black vote – 32 percent).

                That’s likely a relic of Reconstruction. Southern blacks voted Republican because Southern whites supported Democrats. Following the Great Migration and New Deal, blacks began voting for the Democrats for the same reason. They saw the other party as representing whites. As I explained above, latinos are quite diverse and don’t always conform to easy stereotypes. But Trump’s paltry 20 percent share of the black vote supports my point. One’s racial and marital status are still some of the best predictorswe’ve gotof voter behavior.

                    Also, though largely forgotten, Nixon was a civil rights liberal in 1960, hence the appeal to blacks.
His Republican boss, Ike, in 1957 sent the 101st to Little Rock with bayonets for a bit of Reconstruction 2.0.

                I’ll note as always that his being even more “Zion Don” than he was before didn’t improve his terrible results with Jews. The smelly-hat orthodox on welfare are fully partisan Republicans, so they’re incidental allies, sometimes, while the model-citizen high IQ Ashkenazi—who according to the HBD rightfully deserveto rule us—are all Democrats because the only thing they value, more than money or life or evencontrol, is the enslavement and/or destruction of all other European-descended people, and only one party (in each Western country) truly promises that. There’s literally nothing Trump could do to win their support. Heisus.

                I think we’re on the same page here. Race and other biological differences within the over-broad classification “latino” are the best predictor of their politics. Republicans will look at the 2024 election results through CivNat glasses and say, “You see? We’re all the same! Latinos just need to hear our message of…” Americans used to be able to look at cultures south of the border and say, “Our society is clearly better. But even if it weren’t, it’s not who we are!” We no longer know who we are. We’re not allowed to even noticedifferences. Blacks at least know that much. Sadly. it’s a negative political identity: “We ain’t whitey!”

        Semi-OT:
Reports are coming in that the Dems are scheming to try and get Sotomayor to resign from the Supreme Court in hopes of ramming through a replacement before Trump takes office.
These people are simply disgusting. They’re aways dealing in bad faith. They have zero principles other than the naked pursuit of power.

        Only if he shreds the bureaucracy and reorganizes it in a way that prevents it from reforming.  Musk’s BOGE is promising.
Trump is wrong to send DC agencies to other states.  In cancer we call that metastasizing.  Colorado doesn’t need any more Federal government workers.
This warms my heart, though:

            Again, the FBI is also under federal employment law.  They will also have due process rights.  What must be found is a way to circumvent those rights.  Simple firing most likely can not be done without lengthy court appeals and such.

                    It is an arbitrary reclassification that will definitely be challenged.  May work, may not, but it has yet to be tested.  Little different than assuming at will employment and firing folks arbitrarily.  However, it “does” meet my criteria of working around the current law.  One aspect might be to restrict such reclassification to all those in managerial roles within the bureaucracy.  Worker bees do as they are told.

        All these travel vloggers talking up China are paid shills.China’s cashless society?  That is a dystopian nightmare.  Any time it is even remotely possible, I pay for everything in cash.  Google knows far too much about me already.  Google hates me and wants me dead, I give them as little as possible.I run a linux live distro that totally resets everything on reboot.  I use Yandex as much as possible.  When home I use a landline for all telephone calls.  I have the cheapest sailfoam money can buy with nothing set up other than the phone functionality.From what I can tell, China has a well developed 3rd world infrastructure. They have more bridge collapses of brand new bridges than we have with 100 year old bridges.  The facades of buildings fall down on people below them.

They might be, but if they are, they’re more convincing than the paid shills on the China side.

                All those stories?  Nah, all the video of it happening is what convinces me.  Plus, everything I think on China is contingent and tentative.As for how dangerous google is, they are dangerous enough for me to take it seriously.  Google gladly cooperates with LE requests. They don’t even need warrants, they just give it up.But it’s also not just legal.  It’s potential employers googling me.  It’s friends and family. It’s just creepy for Google to want to collect so much information about people.What evil can you not excuse with such stupid rhetoric like:“How many attempts at your life has Google made?Are you really so dangerous to the system that you’re this paranoid?”Plus it’s just principle.  I won’t sell my privacy for digital trinkets.

        ‘It was the “deep state” that took down Nixon and the “deep state” is just a spooky word for the permanent set of institutions that now govern us.’Who staffs and dominates those institutions?  Women, largely Progressive women.  Are you ready to toss tens-of-millions of women out of their AA-acquired positions in government?  I am.  The Right is not.  Need to be beat on some more, I guess.I remember watching the Watergate Hearings with Sudden Sam Ervin when I was in the military.  What a naive political infant I was.  So was the nation.  I am not naive anymore.‘We are now at the final chapter of a period that started with FDR, climaxed in Watergate and may now be coming to an end.’From your hands to God’s ears.

            Nixon took himself out.  Deep State had nothing to do with Nixon’s decision to obstruct the Congressional investigation of the Watergate break in.  There is good reason to believe if Nixon “came clean”, his firing of those involved would have kept him in office and those fired, the “fall guys” sufficient to satisfy Congress.

        ‘It was the “deep state” that took down Nixon and the “deep state” is just a spooky word for the permanent set of institutions that now govern us. The election of Trump in 2024, roughly fifty years after Watergate, may signal the end of managerialism.’The deep state is the skeletal structure of the empire in the sense that without it the empire cannot function internationally or domestically. Trump can exercise power only through the various mechanisms of the deep state — the armed forces, the intelligence agencies, mass media, Wall Street finance. This is probably the contradiction at the heart of Trumpism and what we saw in Trump 1.0 — the populist calls for “draining the swamp” but needing the swamp to exercise power. What I expect from Trump 2.0 is a more clearly definedmodus vivendi with the deep state. He’s probably learnt something from the first time and conversely, the deep state probably feels it can work with him.

            There is a reckoning coming.  Yes, the POTUS needs the bureaucracy to do his job.  The problem is that the bureaucracy became self-aware, like Skynet, and started acting in its own interested often in defiance of the POTUS; and frequently targeting the POTUS.The best answer to this is to gut it.  The problem isn’t the skeleton.  The problem is the cancer, clots, and obesity.Trump has 4 years to try and put in place reforms that need to survive him.  That means:gut the bureaucracyfire the #resistancereorganize entire depts out of existenceprosecutions and harsh penalties for Lawfare – so severe it’ll be 40 years before somebody thinks it’s a good idea to gin up fake prosecutionsdeclassify, declassify, declassifyMusk’s BOGE has a lot of people excited.  75% of Twitter no longer works there.

Here’s something else he can do: reassign everyone’s job to a new location.  Trump can announce he’s opening a new Federal Government Work Site in the middle of the desert in NV.  Then send everybody there to work.  They can quit or they can take the job in the temporary shacks in the desert.

                            They don’t need to be deep at all.  First, there are organizations that will be against Trump and will be happy to file suit for the affected workers.  Second, if there is a possibility of damages, there might also be a possibility of some “class action” suit.  Been there myself with nothing more need to be turned in than a post card.

                        Hey one more point you haven’t considered: Schedule F job classification. If he gets both chambers of Congress, expanding Schedule F to more government employees makes firing them even easier. Trump can classify a certain number under Section F, I think the total number might be limited.

                            Well, yes, that has been referenced by me in the past.  Simply firing, no.  Reclassification via whatever process to “at will” employment is one answer—if it can be done.  Your point well taken.My point is primarily to think these aspects through and go the route of highest probability of potential success with minimum resistance and most lasting effect.In Trump 1 administration, we had a good friend who received appointment to a position in a dept in DC immediately upon Trump’s inauguration.When I spoke with her in depth as to her “job”, it was to review continuing grants from that agency and basically refer them for termination.  Details need not be brought up here, just that she was an “axeman” who reported directly to the dept’s Director.Long and short, I told her she was wasting her time as the programs funding such still remained and would turn back on the spigot once she and Trump packed up their bags.  After Biden’s ascension, she went out of her way next time I met her to exclaim I was “right”, her axed grants had simply been turned on again (She heard this from associates still in the agency.  She herself was “automatically fired” on Inauguration Day precisely from the hour of swearing in.  Perhaps the most efficient action the Fed’s every undertook.)

                        We don’t have rule of law. We have rule of power, which is just another way of saying war without open mass killing (yet). Laws are an extension of mores. So, here’s the thing … THEIR LAWS EXTENDING FROM THEIR DEGENERATE EVIL MORES, not ours. The enemy sees rule of law as a weapon when convenient, and an irrelevancy when inconvenient.We should do the same.So, I don’t care. If you have possession of authority, you exercise power through it to destroy your enemies. Law is irrelevant. Legitimacy comes from actions representing the will of our people.When the enemy is destroyed or expelled, revise the law. Corrupt enemy judges should be laughed at, then ignored until it is their turn for deportation. What matters is having gun-carriers in the forces of orders obeying not the enemy judges, but rather your orders to dismantle enemy institutions public and private.Yes, I know. Pres. Trump will not do any of this. I didn’t vote for him to do this because I knew the best we could hope for domestically is that he would deport Haitians and Mauretanians and import dot-head Indians in their place. I voted for him to end the yet another International-Jew-engineered European brother-war in Ukraine, and give our brothers and sisters in Europe more breathing room to break free of this vile GAE regime, since many of them do actually have legitimate and rising rightwing nationalist parties.

                        “Sovereign Immunity”I perceive misunderstanding of the SCOTUS decision.  SI is absolute wrt direct Constitutionally expressed powers.  Where in the Constitution is it expressed or implied that the President is above the law wrt Congressional legislation protecting the arbitrary dismissal of certain classes of employees?An example, one of the greatest powers of the Executive is to command the armed forces in time of war—indeed, probably why the Founders desired such a position in the first place.  Nonetheless, Congress passed laws after the Vietnam debacle restricting such Presidential power (See: War Powers Act, 1974).I admit, this is too often ignored, but it has never been challenged in SCOTUS to my knowledge.  The President is not above the law.  The power to dismiss employees “at will” is regulated by the “Civil Service Reform Act of 1978”. 9 and others).  To ignore the law is to invite impeachment, which is, in this case, a reasonable response by Congress.

                Even the Fuhrer could not do that — and he was a relatively young man in his mid-40s with a team in its 30s. He had to reach a modus vivendi with the army and the conservatives and with big capital. Hence the Night of the Long Knives in 1934.

                        Not without the ex-imperial officers (like Brusilov or Frunze). Or with aristocrats like Georgy Chicherin. Besides, Bolsheviks had to essentially conquer Russia, that was weakened after removing the only relevant authority figure- the Tsar and split between warlord parties. Once they claimed victory, they observed the ancient custom and took it all.The Leader and Reich’s Chancellor opted for a deal after his own version of Black Shirt March failed miserably. Rohm and Strassers wanted a revolution, he wanted only Germany and a chance to settle the score for the Great War. Even though, he was no stranger to radical revolutionary politics, indicated by his past involvment in the Bavarian Soviet Republic. In the end he chose to transform the Weimar Republic, rather than destroy it. At least he didn’t have to rebuild the industry from the ruins, that job fell to the successor state 🙂

                Trump starts at the top with his appointment power over the Executive Schedule. Then he prioritizes among those appointees the elimination of positions among the Senior Executive Service that he can’t fire directly (10%). This will take a little longer as they have to go through performance reviews.He should also work to abolish all public employee unions. Even FDR was against PEUs. reasoning that they were public servants with a higher calling than private sector employees. What a quaint idea, right?Finally, he should transfer a lot of departments out of Washington just to make life hard for those traitors. Many would resign voluntarily. The Federal Center in Lakewood, CO would be a good place for them. It’s mostly empty land anyway. Also, Colorado has become a solidly blue state so there wouldn’t be any political consequences.

            The suicidal lib freakout compilations are flowing normally, and if you go to a blue hive like Reddit the madness is all still there, maybe with a more expansive genocidal vision than it had last week (hispanic men are white again).Conservatives you can’t trust are aiming their audiences at the handful of media libs who suddenly see a unique awfulness in Kamala. Normal Democrats—the voters—aren’t saying that or buying it, not least because it’s not true. She didn’t underperform, except compared to 2020, whicheveryone has always knownwas an extreme case of ballot fakery.Nobody is “subdued.” They’re marginally more enraged/terrorized than they were the day before.

            What I find hilarious about that report is how they’re all planning to take jobs in “the private security industry”.  What WaTimes means is “federal contracts”.  Those jobs are hard to get after POTUS strips you of your security clearance.  Unitary Executive.
The entire Executive Branch process for investigating and granting security clearances is done on behalf of the POTUS.  He can grant or revoke clearances at the stroke of a pen.
It is one of the most effective weapons Trump has to wipe out the deep state.  That, combined with declassification.

                There’s where we’ll see what Trump is made of.  Revoke *all* clearances once they are no longer needed by the individual—whether through retirement or simple change of position.  To revokes some, but not others is the name of the game—but is it in the best interest of the country?

            There was a rumor Obama had fled the US for Dubai. Unfortunately it was posted by Hal Turner.
More seriously, this is just more evidence Trump needs to be wiping out these clowns’ clearances.
There is literally no reason toadies that have been out of government for years like Brennan and Clapper should continue holding clearances. Professional courtesy is not a valid reason, and it absolutely is a national security risk.

            Political affiliation is a trait that is very heritable, so yes, in many ways they really are born this way.The longer answer is they all have various Cluster B personality disorders. They lacked emotional validation and a secure attachment to a primary caregiver in early childhood. This left them with profound emotional retardation, and no ability to self-regulate their own emotions (think of a toddler that throws a tantrum when they don’t get what they want because at that age they lack the ability to self-soothe — but then in the body of an adult.) It also left a gaping hole in their consciousness they desperately try to fill with external validation, and they all lack a stable sense of identity. This means they adopt politics as their identity and are addicted to pursuing external validation as a means of (emotional and self-identity) survival (“virtue signaling”).That’s most of them. The rest are just NPCs who can’t model not eating breakfast and just do/believe what they’ve been told without question.

            Ed Dutton has had a lot to say about this.  His most recent, “What’s the Psychology of Leftists Screaming Like Children Over Trump’s Win?”….https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFq6uHNW5lI
In various videos, he focuses on how conservatives/rightists and liberals/leftists compare regarding psycho-social traits, such as narcissism, machiavellianism, harm avoidance, group orientation, individualism, etc.  Very interesting, I think, and it often explains a lot.

        I think a big takeaway, not mentioned, from the results this week, is that it is now clear the traditional, so-called “mainstream” media is ignored by most Americans.
Even as recently as 2020, the major media organs could still shape the narrative as we saw with COVID.
At this point, the major media organs keep repeating Trump is a fascist, racist, sexist,  felon, threat to democracy, and most ignore it or even laugh at it.  51% still voted for him.
It is now beyond a reasonable doubt that Rogan, Carlson, etc. are more influential than the traditional media

            “Nixon had nothing to do with it…”That may be so, but Nixon was not being impeached for Watergate break in, per se.  He was being impeached for covering it up and basically “obstruction of justice”.  In that the Congress had him dead to right.  John Dean was the star witness against Nixon to that effect.  Further, there was the deletion of (possible) direct evidence on the WH tapes, but even so the tapes in part showed awareness of the effort to stymie the Congressional investigation on the part of Nixon.Nixon resigned after a delegation of members of Congress met with him and told him he had no hope of surviving Impeachment and Conviction in Congress.  Nixon, being of the old school Greatest Generation had some integrity and did not wish to be the first President to be removed from office for criminal activity.Today it seems criminal activity is a plus mark in the resume for most all candidates for Congress.  Sigh…

                Nixon’s process crime of “obstructing justice” was saying he had heard about the break-in two days later than he actually heard about it. What is unsure is if the Plumbers had his explicit go-ahead, or if they did it on their own.
I also agree with the claim that it was a young Republican intern named Hillary Clinton in his office who erased the infamous 18 minutes of tape.
It was Nixon’s idea to start taping White House conversations in the first place, in order to bring ethical transparency to the position.

                    There is absolutely zero evidence that Clinton had access to, or deleted the 18 minutes of Oval Office tape.  She did not work in the WH, but worked in the Capital on the Judicial Committee, therefore had no direct access to the tapes then in Nixon’s possession.  Whether she tampered with them after turn over is not in evidence and she could not have  known if the tapes had not been copied before turn over. It would be embarrassing if the 18 minutes were retrieved only to be found favorable to Nixon’s defense.As far as Nixon goes and a “process crime”, John Dean specifically testified to such collusion to obstruct.  This is not a “process crime”.  This is direct evidence of conspiracy to obstruct.  The testimony and other circumstantial evidence was such that a Congressional delegation from both houses met with Nixon to inform him that “a polling” of Congress assured his impeachment and removal.  The matter was set to be voted upon and Nixon had a short time to decide.  None other than Barry Goldwater led this delegation.  He was known as an honorable man.You really need to stop this ex post facto conspiracy theory nonsense.  Nixon got what he deserved.  He was the cause of his own downfall.  I liked the guy and voted for him twice!  But he was a par excellent politician, and that’s no compliment these days.As to taping conversations in the Oval Office, Kennedy was the first to start wide spread, sophisticated taping.  Nixon had nothing to do with “starting” such.  He simply continued it.  And Nixon was anything *but* transparent in his administration as shown by the tapes, but that’s my opinion.  The rest is easily looked up.

            Well, that doesn’t really say what you think it does. Trump could be saying Q actually is Steve Bannon or whoever working the behind the scenes – or he could be saying that Q is Chuck Schumer and it actually was a psyop to divert the energies of his supporters during his first term.
I don’t know, man. I’m sick of hearing about Q. put up or shut up, I think Q was a large reason for the demoralization and “nothing ever happens” blackpilling from the first administration, especially in 2020.

                All it takes is one sentence from Trump disavowing Q. He not only hasn’t done that, he embraces it. Eric Trump even appeared twice on the number one show intertwining opinion, current events and Q posts, X22report. It really amuses me that people can’t see it.

                    Like I said, put up or shut up. Until I see Tom Hanks and Nancy Pelosi doing perp walks I will be skeptical.

                        I’m going to love rubbing it in when Trump comes clean. You people who see yourselves as (fake) dissidents, yet you lap up what the derp state wants you to believe. Muh, Q is a psy-op.
It is a psy-op, but it’s coming from Trump.

                I see this is a sign that we have left the age of ‘grammar Nazis’ behind and are now in the new and glorious age of ‘grammar globalists’. I will just call them “gg’s” for brevity.
