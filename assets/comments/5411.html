        I like this piece.Like me some revolt, some rebellion, its overdue.
Andrew Brietbart said something beautiful, (lord I miss that guy), he said “culture is upstream of politics”So is a plurality.So is consent, its withdrawal.
He was right.It made me think of something upstream of that when he coined that axiom.Liberty is upstream of tyranny.Liberty has this kind of motive power. Unlike tyranny it evolves, those who believe in it, they outflank the sonofabitches, the tyrants, the corruptocrats. Liberty is an insurgency, natural born grass roots like.

            I really miss Breitbart, too. He could really take the Left to the woodshed; he had no fear.

                Ya, you got that right. Andrew was a warrior.He had audacity, fearless, and he handed them their worthless arses every day. I think they killed him. He was very dangerous. A leader people believed in.He was the Micheal Collin’s of our time.

        Boehnor, McConnell, Justice Roberts …  often look to me like men who are in fear.  The Right SAYS  that the left is a treasonous criminal gang, but I think we are still in denial about the fact that it is literally true and have not really internalized the DANGER to those who resist the left.Think: criminal gang accustomed to loot in the trillions, whose supporters mostly live off some form of govt. money.  If they lose control, some may face the dreaded prospect of earning a living in the private sector, paid only what the free market determines they are worth. We might even get the justice department cleaned out, and pursue some of the bigger frauds.I’ve dealt with criminals before, I think there is great cause to fear -that massive pile of money and power can “justify” great evils. Our “leaders” are in the front facing some really terrible people who really hate them.By all means, lets get rid of bad leaders who may be blackmailed or have their families threatened. And for goshsake let’s end this whole “lifetime judge” thing. Maybe we can find replacements cocky enough to fight the EVIL which besets our country. But  that scared look tells me it is going to take some real courage to face the leftists and I can’t be too enthusiastic about condemning McConnel et al.

        NRO epitomizes the professional right. You get the impression there is a detachment between the columnists and and the commenters, who are viewed as little more than nuisance that the magazine probably wishes they could do away with.

        For most American Jews, and perhaps those everywhere else except Israel, the only battle worth winning is themoralbattle. Show that you care more, and it matters not what the consequences of your caring are. The country you inhabit, its history and traditions, its demography — irrelevant. They are just anchors to the past, impeding the ship of state sailing full speed to the Land of Milk and Honey, run by the government for the good of all. Anything that weakens the anchor chain, from delivering atomic bomb secrets to the USSR to population replacement, shows the tribe’s superior priorities.

        You have it exactly right – we are tired of those who would go along to get along instead of standing up. “They’re really gonna like us now that we agree with them, right?” The Right just never understood, and it seems like they still don’t, that the Left was always in it for The Win, and that the ends always justifies the means. The Right wants to float above it all with the better ideas but the inability to convince enough people why those ideas and values trump (no pun intended) Leftist thought and policies. They are thinking, well, everyone will just “see” that our ideas are superior, and come on over to our side and the country will turn around in no time. Impossible, though, when you can’t fight the battles that matter, like immigration, and when you allowed the Left to take over every institution in the country. Moral cowards.
