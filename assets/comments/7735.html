        I supported Trump in part because he could break through against the media. I don’t see how any politician these days can be successful when the media decides not to cover them. They like to trot out McCain and Graham as “true Republicans” every chance they get. It’s entertaining to watch the press try to deal with someone that doesn’t respect them.

            Isn’t that the truth.  One of the key reasons I gave up watching FOX News was their insistence on using people like McCain and Graham as Republican spokes people for any and all issues needing input from a “conservative” position.  Made me want to puke.I cancelled my subscription years ago.  And then the last two elections we get McCain and Romney?  What a clusterf**k!!But what is so depressing is that some 40% of the US population supports slimy worms like clinton even with all the baggage she and he carry.  Nancee Pelosee, Harree Reed, Barnee Frank, and Chriss Dodo, Edward Kennedee, it’s bad enough locals vote for these scalawags.  But then they rise to power and get national positions that give them reign over the nation.  And just who the f**k voted for these A-holes??It isn’t just the lying that is going on.  It is the sick minds that accept the lies because as the popular saying goes “Well, he might be a scoundrel, but he’s our scoundrel.”  If only he/she stayed that way and stayed local.  But noooooo!  They of course want more power and rise to national prominence where the ability to lie, cheat, and who knows what else, enables them to insinuate themselves in positions that are protected for life, e.g. no term limits.  Where are the fricking term limits???For the Senate, for the SCOTUS?  We need term limits.  I can only hope that charges are brought against many for the last two terms of completely unAmerican activities and that people hang!Maybe you can tell I am a little pissed off right now.

        The only way to break through the noise is to be outrageous and what is more outrageous than telling outlandish lies that everyone knows are lies?
Apparently what’s outrageous is telling simple truths.

            Like they say, the truth is a revolutionary idea in a time of universal deceit. That in it’s self is outrageous.I vote the psychopath vagina in a pants suit is the benchmark of ZMan’s scale to gauge the level of psychotic potential of the rest of the oligarchy. After all, she is the next anointed figure head of their gangster government they have chosen to precede obamagotterung, and fully funded to the tune of billions.

        QuoteRon Unz:“Actually, another suspicion I’ve often had is that much of that massively-promoted total nonsense like transexualism and Gay Marriage is meant to flush out and expose potential troublemakers potentially lurking within ranks of the elite before they can rise high enough to become a serious problem. In support of this hypothesis, the leading purge victims are usually found within the fields of popular culture, entertainment, celebrity, and the media, which constitute a crucial chokepoint in controlling our society. It’s obviously much easier and safer to detect and purge a future Mel Gibson while he’s just a rising young actor than after he’s spent a dozen years as Hollywood’s #1 star.Suppose that Kim III officially declares that the Moon is made of blue cheese. Who would question that? Dimwitted people would believe whatever they heard on TeeVee. Cowardly people would just keep quiet or mouth the propaganda. Dishonest, opportunistic people would shout the slogan and endlessly promote it. Those sorts aren’t much threat to the Regime.On the other hand, a few people might raise questions about the dogma, revealing themselves to be exactly the sort of individuals who might eventually question other, far more serious matters. And purging them on the blue cheese nonsense tends to avoid bringing unwanted attention to those other issues. Furthermore, if some borderline people grit their teeth and publicly endorse the blue cheese question, their spirits may have been partially broken, making it less psychologically likely they’ll eventually rebel over other matters. Towards the end of the USSR almost nobody believed in the regime ideology, but most people still pretended they did.I think Orwell made some of these points in 1984.So the reason the King walks down the street naked in his imaginary suit is to draw out and catch those people unwilling to say they see what isn’t there.In an actual historical example, the Emperor Caligula appointed his favorite horse to the highest official government position in the Roman State. How better to break the spirit of potentially disloyal Senators and military commanders, and determine which of them might have independent thoughts.This sort of system tends to be metastable, holding together until sufficient pressure causes a crack to develop, at which point the entire edifice collapses, possibly in very messy ways. Eventually Caligula and almost all of his relatives were butchered in a revolt by the top imperial courtiers and the palace guard.”Found via the Bloody shovel in hisThe purpose of absurditypost, who added:“Well put. But personally what struck me is that he had to come up with this by his own. A very intelligent man in his 50s had to personally realize this. When it should be a perfectly obvious point.”He then goes on telling the Chinese “calling a deer a horse story”:“So Zhao Gao brings a deer into the palace. Grabs it from the horns, calls the emperor to come out, and says “look your majesty, a brought you a fine horse”. The Emperor, not amused, says “Surely you are mistaken, calling a deer a horse. Right?”. Then the emperor looks around at all the ministers. Some didn’t say a word, just sweating nervously. Some others loudly proclaimed what a fine horse this was. Great horse. Look at this tail! These fine legs. Great horse, naturally prime minister Zhao Gao has the best of tastes.A small bunch did protest that this was a deer, not a horse. Those were soon after summarily executed. And the Second Emperor himself was murdered some time later.”https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chinese_Stories/Calling_a_deer_a_horsehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhao_Gao#Calling_a_deer_a_horseCalling a spade a spade is dangerous business in present day murka.

            Spandrell, whose cite to my amazement I only lately discovered, had some apposite points on this issue, including noting that it’s mainly Anglo-Saxons who find this idea revelatory. That’s a great strength and weakness of our culture.I find myself in the middle ground on the substance insofar as I can’t not think of transexualism as mental illness. Unlike homosexuality, to date a demonstrated ineradicable feature of nature in the human and some other species, and therefore at least not “unnatural” in any non-religious sense, transexualism actually requires belief in something contrary to scientific evidence. It’s essentially magical thinking itself or even a form of spiritualist religion. In the absence of souls or spirits distinct from the material body, which I presume progressives cannot believe in, the phrase ‘woman trapped in a man’s body’ has no meaning. So I’m with Ron Unz on that.On the other hand- gay marriage I’d like to oppose but in the absence of religion I can’t find a viable language for it. If marriage is only intended as a civil law relationship meant to provide social recognition and benefits to a particular kind of intimate relationship, defined by society however it wants, based wholly in positive law and communal norms, revocable under terms defined by law, and given a sentimental gloss by tying it to communal recognition of ‘love’, which is how society has for some time defined heterosexual marriage, then I can’t think of a way to exclude gays from it. All arguments for permanence were tossed decades ago. Sexual complementarity requires reliance on metaphysics or explicit religious/biblical concepts society simply does not recognize, or would believe in any more. Reproduction is not considered a necessary element of heterosexual marriage, and is explicitly eschewed by many participants as one of their goals.One could note that every human society regardless of religion, including those more tolerant of homosexuality in certain circumstances, has reserved marriage for men and women. But then it would be hard to cite a truer vision of Greece and Rome to make the case- it would require reliance on the idea of the citizens’ duty to produce children for the state to a degree no party in the modern west could get behind.So unless Christian or Muslim, or probably Jewish, none of which systems any longer command predominant cultural support, no argument against gay marriage is liable to gain traction.And to return to the narrower point, I don’t think advocates for all this believe it is just signalling. They believe every word. And as far as the gay marriage component goes, I can’t argue with them. If how I defined marriage above is what it is, and that is what the law has said for many years, then there is nothing in it that demands two sexes. There’s nothing in it that limits the participants to two people either, of course. Just wait until that becomes mainstream. The progressives don’t believe that yet, but they will.

            It’s called “gaslighting”. Leftists and women (especially ex-wives and feminists) are experts at it.
Go to Wikipedia. They have a whole page on it (or just goggle it).

        Ever had a girlfriend cheat on you, or have a good friend whose girl cheated on him?  Not to get personal, but like (I’m assuming) everyone here, I’m sure liberalsmustbe lying about Magic Shape Theory and everything else…  But then I remember that liberals are creatures of pure emotion.  They live in their amygdalae.  Yeah, the guy whose girl is obviously stepping out on him knows it on some level, but watching what he “knows” catch up to what heknowsis excruciating.  If you assume that liberals live in that zoneall the time– that every minute of every day is an emotional seesaw from “search your feelings, you know it to be true!” to “you’re not my father!” — then some of their apparent schizophrenia makes sense.  “No, she’s not cheating on me!  She just had a meeting with her boss that ran really long, and she knew I’d be asleep when she came home, so when the boss offered to pay for a hotel room for her, she jumped at it.  Because she’s so courteous and loves me that much.”

            An odd analogy but I agree with you 🙂Not only that, but they’ve become emotionally invested in the lie. And what’s more, they’ve nailed their colors to the mast. Once you’ve said something in public with all the world watching, backtracking is hardly an option.

        The story of “The Emperor’s New Clothes” is proof that this phenomena isn’t entirely new.Once you have an ethos, there will be some who will demonstrate their virtue by saying blatantly illogical things in the name of that ethos or by acting irrationally in the name of the ethos. And when someone in a position of power (an emperor, official or unofficial), what’s to stop them from going crazy and what’s to stop others from adopting this obvious insanity. As Steyn put it “who are you going to believe? Me or your lyin’ eyes?”.So we have the emperor decree that men who ‘identify’ as women are women, which is pretty close to arguing that the naked emperor ‘identified’ himself as well-dressed and was therefore well-dressed.Curiously, those who identify as guided by Islam are not guided by Islam 🙂

        British comedian Eddie Izzard did a show called “Dressed to Kill” some years ago in which he brought up a similar subject of why there are degrees of murder; e.g.first degree murder, manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter – yet no degrees of perjury. There’s the harmless lie such as you did your homework when in fact you didn’t vs.the serious lie that you didn’t murder someone when you actually did.As you work to develop and calibrate you “Nork” scale, I’m sure there will be others in here who will mention the internationally recognized “BS meter” which may serve as a good point of reference.

                    Hey, I’m just being honest.  I found was I was looking at … revolting.  I knew nothing of the guy or his schtick but I wanted nothing to do with it.  There are enough of these “clowns” running around on the street and I don’t need to see them on tv.  So just because I find him offensive, I’m the one with the problem?  Maybe those who accept him and his ‘act’ should consider what they are letting into their minds.

                @ Infidel – I was once frightened by funny men who wore make-up, inappropriate shoes and clothes that made them look un-manly. I remember running to my mother out of sheer terror at the sight of them. But when I got older, my fear of circus clowns went away.

                Izzard has been funny at times (his sketch where he recounts the story of the brother of Darth Vader who worked in the canteen on the Death Star is probably Izzard at his funniest) but like all trendy media types he gets a bit full of his own sense of self-importance. The media then asks these comedians their opinions on things other than trying to tell jokes, and proceeds to treat their views on politics as serious.As for the man wearing high heels, so what? If he wants to risk turning his ankle tottering round in them in the quest for outrage I won’t be sending hims get well card.

                    Fully agree – You know society is in trouble when the media consults actors and comedians on science, politics, history and culture. It’s bad enough one can’t find a decent science or history program on TV while there is an endless supply of cooking shows and sports commentators.

        Part of me wonders if the reflexive chanting about the “conservative culture of hate” against LGBT folks empowered this guy to go shoot 100 people in a nightclub says more about the default thinking of Progressives than anything else.  I just watched a couple local Facebook flame wars that went immediately to “leave our town”, “your post should be deleted” and worse–just because a guy had the temerity to suggest Obama has really screwed the pooch on this one.  These poor things actually believe we have the same totalitarian default setting that they have.  And when you explain “no, I just want to be left alone” they simply cannot process the desire to self determine and let others do the same.

            One of the wonders of Facebook is that you learn how many stupid people there are out there. I get tired of the attempts at gun grabbing. Other countries use different weapons to kill people. We don’t see a lot of machete attacks here. Everything gets called a mass shooting, if the Dems feel they can make points with it. I’ve been in a Facebook fight with some woman that tried to tell me that Christians have killed more people in the US than Muslims. I’m not sure how her example of Andre Brevik fit in, but then I’m not really sure you could call Tim McVey a Christian either. She got huffy when I called her a bigot too. I think it is going to start getting ugly fast. I know I have no patience for that sort of nonsense any more.

        DalrympleThere is no fury like a non-judgementalist scorned.When our mistakes fall into a consistent pattern over many years….they become symptoms of defects in character.It is normal for small acts of betrayal to be seduced away from our memories to fashion ourselves a better self-conceit.It is well worth remembering that one-man one-vote democracy is perfectly compatible to the greatest crimes known to man.Humor, fearlessness, seriousness, and honesty: the qualities that are hated by all the smelly little orthodoxies that are contending for tenure in the humanities departments of our universities.Overwhelming guilt not in proportion to terrible wrongdoing is but a sin of spiritual pride and self-importance.Intellectual error is at the root of most evil.A technique vital to all schools of resentment is the collapse of all relevant moral distinctions.When words become the test of virtue, they also become the masks of vice. That is why sanctimony and ruthless self-interest are such powerful allies.The absence of religious faith…can have a deleterious effect upon human character and development. If you empty the world of purpose, make it one of brute fact alone, you empty it of reasons for gratitude. A sense of gratitude is necessary for both happiness and decency. For what can soon replace gratitude is a sense of entitlement.The crude nostrums of Islamism rush in where the enlightenment fears to tread.Resentment is one of the few emotions that never lets you down.

        I’ve seen this a bit in the corporate world. I never worked for a big conglomerate, so my experiences are limited to companies that actually might go out of business of they really screwed the pooch. Generally, this sort of magical thinking becomes pronounced when nearly everyone realizes that you’re about to go broke. If you’re going down, you might as well go down thinking nice thoughts.

            Yep.  Lots of folks — myself definitely included — think liberalism is triumphant because they win all the fights.  But they’re really the Harlem Globetrotters.  They’re all flash and no substance, and they only win because they only ever play the Washington Generals.  They’re not getting more hysterical because they’re doing a victory lap; they’re getting more hysterical because they know the barbarians (=social and economic reality) are at the gate.  Ever seen that wonderful movieDownfall?The Red Army was two blocks away, yet what was left of the Gestapo still found time to hang starving civilians for “defeatism.”

        Not to be too much of a wet blanket, but I wonder about the magic shape theory angle. That certainly would explain so many gun controllers’ fascination with pistol grips and evil black stamped metal and plastic. But how many of them actually believe that the existence of the guns actually cause people to go out and kill? That seems an exaggeration of their beliefs, at least in most cases.Do most not simply believe that 1) the relatively high availability of guns and relative ease of access to them [or specific types of guns that allow for more rapid fire] in the US make it easier for those inclined to kill a lot of people to do so than it is in most other western countries where guns are harder to get; 2) that the 2nd amendment is archaic if not wrong; and 3) that it should be possible to reduce access to guns by sustained effort?For my part, I find some of that hard to argue with. For proposition 1, I’m aware that there are many other relevant differences between American society and those of Canada, Australia, or most of Europe, and that gun massacres have happened in all these places. Nevertheless they seem to happen with vastly greater regularity in the US and under a wider range of other circumstances. I am not at all of the view that these considerations should countermand the many arguments in favour of private ownership of a wide array of arms. But they don’t seem unreasonable observations in and of themselves. For 2, I disagree with this view of the 2nd Amendment and note that liberals are too gutless [ for now] to actually propose amending the constitution properly, which would be the legitimate way to debate and remove this right. If they could. But the liberal view of it is not magical thinking. For 3, I suspect they have no thought through the logistical nightmare or the force required, but it probably would be possible for a government like USG to manage it, even if not to the degree of other societies.I should emphasize that I am more in sympathy with your views than this comment suggests, but I’m just not sold that magic shape theory is enough to capture the whole of the liberal position. Many just have different ideas of what citizens’ rights are and have not yet worked up the guts to take that to an amendment process that could by definition change those rights, and most may have a too-high estimation of the capacity of government to enforce any prohibition they could come up with.One area that does bug me along similar lines to your reaction is the whole “AR-15 = bad” meme. Those who are in thrall to magic shape theory seem really fascinated with those pistol grips and still unable to grasp the meanings of auto vs semi-auto. Although, in their partial defence, if they took away semi-auto weapons, how many men who haven’t been through pre-war British infantry training could take out an entire room of dozens with a bolt action rifle or a 6-7 shot revolver? That would probably incrementally reduce casualties, if nothing else.

            The fact is, for close quarter work you are better off with a pistol, unless others can shoot back. Not that I spend time thinking of it, but if I were looking to pull an Orlando, I’d go with a Glock pistol and maybe a sawed off shotgun if I could conceal it under a coat. That leaves lots of room on the body for clips. The shotgun lets you make a grand entrance and then a pistol lets you shoot fish in a barrel.Of course, the best way to do these sorts of things is with a car bomb. It’s why the car bomb is so popular around the world. In the US, we have loads of old cars that can be had on the sly. Steal an old car, stash it away for a while and then make it into a car bomb. My guess is we start seeing this within the decade. A couple of morons with a minimum of training could use easily obtainable materials to build a car bomb.The people in charge surely know this. But, never let a crisis go to waste. The long war for the people in charge started in 1642 and will not end until the bad whites are driven from the land. Muslims could be taking a dump on Obama’s head right now and he will still be ranting about honky racists and their boomsticks.

                I’ve always been a pistol caliber Carbine man.  Love the MP5, Grease Guns, and the new fangled ones like the Beretta Storm.  Easy to shot accurately out to 100 yards, not much recoil or fuss, lots of capacity, fast reload, and fairly light (except for the Thompson – they feel like they are made out of battleship steel and concrete).
Modern body armor has made them fairly obsolete for military use.

Allegedly “Mateen” used a non-AR pattern , 5.56 carbine with an AKMS-style folding stock.  Not as compact as a machine pistol. Potentially shorter than a sawed off shot gun.

            A plain old Remington 870 with an extended tube is going to put 72 .33 caliber projectiles down range in less than 10 seconds.  Probably 10 million of them floating around.  No fancy grips sights or “thingys that go up”.   And yes, a “mad minute” is a lot of fun.  The Lee-Enfield, with the “cock on close” feature, is still the smoothest bolt infantry rifle out there.

        I think we’re starting to see a lot more people wake up to the “culture of lies” we find ourselves in. There have always been the lone voice(s) in the wilderness, but it’s been hard to reach a large audience when the Leftist Progressive media controls the levers of information dessemination. Enter Trump, who has paved the way for others to tell the truth he is not afraid to give voice to. Last night I saw Kallstrom on Fox. He’s laying the blame for the FBIs inability to stop the Orlando slaughter by a Moslem squarely at the door of the White House. Then there’s Milo Yiannopulous, a conservative gay man from Britain, who isn’t afraid to tell the truth about Islam and the unholy alliance between Islam and the Progressive Left. He’s a great speaker and unafraid to call out the Left. More truth tellers will emerge. Americans are used to speaking their minds, not swallowing government-sponsored lies.

        I had a hardy chuckle after reading that Zuckerberg predicted we’d be plugged into the Matrix by 2050. Really? I’ve been warning for years that we are already in the Matrix where everything is illusion. I’m equally hoarse and exhausted from screaming in a vacuum where no one can hear.I have my theory of the vehicle that so easily brought us here. Advertising. I spent my youth as a photo stylist. My job was to make everything look better than good, whether a bed set or a plate of food, the art of illusion is all about the sell. But if, over time, you multiply the sell in dozens of ways pushed out in visuals bathing the brain all day long via TV, magazines, newspapers, billboards, and now internet – what you have is conditioning and indoctrination to the unreal being accepted as the new normal real. What is real and true is irrelevant.I love all Dr. Daniel’s (aka Dalrymple) books – I recommend Spoilt Rotten and Life at the Bottom.
