        I have spoken with many a lefty who believed with certainty that he was a centrist. Given their circle of friends, education, reading and viewing habits, they are.

        That chart is the funniest thing I’ve seen in years.  Glenn Beck and Limbaugh are way out in the right wing outlands, but MSNBC is slightly to the left of center, along with HuffPo and Politico; Al Jazeera America is in the same category as the NYT (they are, but not in the way the chart portrays); with Slate and The New Yorker (!?) furthest left, though not as far left as the barn burners on the right.  Given that, 40 years ago, Sean Hannity and Bill O’Reilly would have been Kennedy Democrats, and Jon Stewart would have had his own file in J. Edgar Hoover’s desk, I’d say that Ross Douthat is missing the larger story here.  But then Douthat used to be a senior editor at The Atlantic, and is a favorite of David Brooks.

        Political labels are useful for our reptilian overlords, they control both Capitalism and Communism since the 19th century with the Rotschid and Karl Marx, some True Russian intellectuals like Dotoevsky and Bakunin were aware of this fact and said what was going to happen.
