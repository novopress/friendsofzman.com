        Malkin is on to something: McCain’s Ghost should be invoked at every opportunity (Amnesty, Israel) and mocked in ruthless bronze age manner.  Maybe this is one altar we can topple before they get it built.

            Sure, Trump cucked, but his 2016 style is the way forward. Ruthless, unapologetic mockery.
People like it, and it works. It’s the winners’ style.

        One of my friends, who is wildly pro-Trump, was extremely upset about CPAC this year.  She’s been a huge fan of Rush, Hannity, Charlie Kirk, and Candace Owens, and all the conservatives on Trump’s side.  She’s mentioned that she’d love to attend CPAC a few times. “Boomer Conservative” would be a good description. Also, in her own words, “she loves Laura Loomer”, and has recently become aware of Goldy and Fuentes. The treatment of Loomer, Goldy and Fuentes, along with the invitations for Van Jones and Oliver Darcy were a real eye-opener for her.

            The Van Jones invitation should be a watershed moment. How can even semi clueful people pretend that CPAC isn’t a scam?

        After many years Ann Coulter was disinvited to that event.  I knew she would be when Trump said “I don’t know the woman.”  That’s basically code for “your career is dead.”  What orange man doesn’t know, and what no one in the political establishment seems to know, as they mock AOC, is that Trump, at this point, can lose to a far left candidate.  The country is not where they think it is.  It’s been bifurcated with the death of the middle class.  And make no mistake, the middle class is stone dead in huge swaths of the country.  What passes as middle class today is the former upper-middle class now living as middle class due to the slow creep of inflation and stagnant wages.

        Z … FFS: what do you expect Trump to do? Over 50% of Americans are against him. Our side needs to understand the process better too. You don’t get elected and then just walk over 50% of the nation and sweep them aside as if they are nothing. Those guys have been running the country through shills and grifters since the 60’s and maybe even longer.Trump has gotten the ball rolling and that by itself is a massive achievement. Typically in the past Lefty has insulted conservatives with gay abandon and then scolded them if they dared say anything back. “Be civil, you uncultured hicks!” They have shouted down people that notice the obvious flaws in their narrative. Hell’s bells, were it not for Trump, you would have a menopausal dyke and her rapist husband back in the Whitehouse again. That is how powerful those arrayed against us are.Trump has turned the tables. He’s gotten real issues into the public consciousness. He doesn’t go barking after the stick that Lefty throws for him. On several occasions he’s beaten their sorry asses with it. People are laughing at the democrats or are shaking their heads in disgust. Take heart – we are doing quite well.Back before I severed ties with my proggie leftist family – in rare moments of candor and honesty… a few of them noticed that the world didn’t work the way they had been taught it would. A few of them saw the ripples in the Matrix and were scared spitless by it. Those are the guys we need to target. Look at Jordan Peterson – he isn’t perfect, but he erupted right in Lefty’s back yard, right under their noses. There are millions more people like that and they are not going to abandon ship lightly. They look over here and see fags like Milo and Vox Day and note that we have a few clowns of our own to contend with.It’s a big job, reversing all this. It took us two decades to get here. It’s going to take at least that long to fix the problems that face us. That’s my two cents, your mileage may vary.

            Pretty much my two cents as well.  I understand the impatience among the group here, but the subtle calls for an ideological “purge” within the movement seem both premature and unwise.

                As an individualist,  Peterson’s thoughts and observations on society are worthless since he only recognises the individual. His being thrown into prominence should be a clue to how “safe” his views are to the keepers of the status quo. Nothing he’s done since switching to the black suit and t shirt uniform is any good.

                    Really.  You’ve seen his classroom lectures on IQ and it’s relationship to human ability?  That has no meaning in the context of today’s obsessive fixation on diversity as a good in and of itself?  You think that students will not come to the conclusion when they experience failure of such diversity that there is a relationship to IQ?

                    Oh please, that’s a steaming pile. Peterson has stated repeatedly he has to be very careful what he says or it’s curtains for him. He and guys like Tucker Carlson and Lou Dobbs  have gone as far as they can in the mainstream.Go any farther and they end up black listed and become a non-entity like Sailer or the VDare crowd.Much of his advice for young men is spot on. It better than getting them black pilled and wanting to slit their throat or waste their time being playing militia warrior. NLook our young white men need to build themselves up to be both confident and competent. To be organized, disciplined and carrying heavy responsibilities and so on. His advice is good. It’s better than what the alt-right doyens have to offer which is nothing and often jealous of Peterson’s success.Peterson isn’t the end all. but he’s a start.

                I can see the criticisms made here, but do not share the concerns.  Again, there is little in the referenced presentation outlining the good in the Jordan Peterson phenomena —only the bad—which is basically a one sided presentation and pretty much decries his emphasis on individual accountability vs white group identity. In short, he is not racially, consciously pure enough for the “movement”—with a touch of globalist conspiracy behind the scenes manipulation tossed in for good measure.

            Trump has been winning with judges because there is a Federalist Society that knows what its members believe and polices its ranks.He, and we, need a similar organization for the bureaucracy. The Left knows sociologists and masters of public administration can’t get there without being policed by the Left, so they’ll confidently fill their staff with such.If we could get our ideas straight, or at least good enough to create shibboleths, we could create a bureaucratic/administrative society that the next Trump can draw from to get work done.The Left uses theirs to walk over 50% of the nation and sweep us aside.  Why can’t we?

                Bob, the bureaucracy needs to be largely cashiered.  They are against us from the start, because featherbedding and lack of accountability are their stock in trade, and they will always go Left, as a group.

                I frankly am not certain what “our shibboleths” are, and this uncertainty correlates well with the decades-long failure of the USA’s “conservatism” to conserve much of anything.
My impression is that race-realism, free-enterprise capitalism and Christian morality are each embraced by a distinct minority of the electorate.  As the Democrats increasingly embrace the politics of white-guilt-colored-virtue, race realism may be the one shibboleth we can successfully promote, but actually selling that position to the electorate is tricky.
Unfortunately, the “dog whistle” may be the best we can do….

                    A foundation of Leftism is equality.  If we deny that, race-realism follows, maybe.“Equal men are not free.  Free men are not equal.” might be a good slogan that whistles about racism.  It doesn’t scare normies, but it might be a poison pill for Leftists.

            Good post.  If nothing else, Trump has shown that the media can throw everything in it’s racism basket at a politician, and the voting patterns of the brown people will not move much.  That fear has cowered republicans for decades.

            A lot of our writing focuses on the Kalergists, who deploy “inclusion” as a cynical and genocidal political strategy.But locally, a lot of normie MAGAists really believe in it, and have an honest desire to bring all the races, and all the freaks, under one big happy American tent.Unfortunately, their good-heartedness and naivete are killing our civilization. We have a lot of red-pilling to do, to make them see that it can’t work, and won’t work.It sounds hard, but remember, we only have to get them to understand things that their grandfathers believed just through first-hand knowledge and common sense.

                The Donald Sub-Reddit is paradoxical in this way . Half the time its as red pilled as the most Dissident Right website , the rest of the time its civic nationalist enough to make an episode of NCIS sound like it was written by UltrasI would suggest that the one area where some efforts can be made with both sides and even a few on the Left is illegal immigration and to a smaller degree legal immigration.Getting past the cheap labor crowds stranglehold won’t be easy but if Dissidents want to bother talking to Establishment while they build a power and ideological base, that area can be fruitful if handled cautiouslyUltimately the grifters , I so love to see other  people use the word and the cheap labor crowd must no longer be allowed any power. It won’t be easy, the US was basically founded as a sort of tax dodge meets long con and is packed with these sorts from every rat hole on this good Earth and has been for centuriesIts doable though and dragging the US into “developed nationhood” even if it has to be kicking and screaming is something the Dissident Right needs to do.

            Glenn Beck is a complete and total tool.
I followed the Ron Paul campaign pretty closely when he made his run for President.  Whenever Paul was down – Beck would talk him up.  As soon as he had a good poll or a good showing in a primary – Beck would be talking him down and sticking a knife in his back.
And yet I still had plenty of “conservative” friends who thought Beck was the greatest thing ever.  They just never caught onto to his flip flopping.

        It certainly can be depressing. I watched Michelle Malkin’s talk, the lone talk on immigration (but three on defending Israel ofc) and the room was mostly empty in spite of a pretty rousing speech and the people that were there were decidedly elderly.But there is a silver lining for those of us who think there is no political solution and an acceleration of the decline while we still have a slight demographics is preferable. I sort of see the lack of any serious political opposition to be a good thing. Why delay the inevitable, better to let this circus pick up speed before whites are a minority and the government has a chance to start widescale gun confiscation.The dog-pile of Republicans joining with Dems to oppose Trump’s emergency declaration is all the proof anyone should need to realize that there is no help coming from D.C. no matter how many Republicans we elect. I came to the bitter realization a long time ago that when it comes time to line up the commies against the wall, they will be standing in the blood of cuckservatives.

            Remember the Covington kids were wearing red MAGA caps.
A friend and I were talking one day. We both agreed that during our high school days our friends and classmates rarely ever talked politics. Even during the 1996 presidential election which occurred when we were in HS politics was rarely discussed outside of Social Studies class.  My friend is a high school teacher though and he reports that kids in high school nowadays often talk, and argue politics.

            I can second this. White kids are noticing that every other group gets to be proud of who they are except yours truly. They’re noticing that they they’re called racist for no reason.
White kids are brain-washed daily, but what you see in real life has 100 times the impact of some TV show. And once you notice one thing, the whole narrative starts to unravel.
Becoming a minority has a way of waking you up. Boomers can afford to ignore reality, European American teenagers can’t.

                My kids, now in their 20s, were carefully sheltered, by us, their parents, from vibrancy in the schools and the neighborhood.  We white flighted, years ago, away from the corrosive vibrancy.  Now they have an unrealistic Kumbaya view of humanity.  I am not so sure we did them any favors.  Sometimes, exposure to the disease builds up the immunity.

                The lefties seem to be intent on accelerating this.Just last night there was a report on the Evening News about some high school kids in Newport Beach CA making a swastika out of drinking cups (some sort of drinking game apparently) – and then doing the stiff arm salute.Just like the Jessie Smellit story – this is probably going to become the latest leftist cause outrage celebre.  I was laughing when I saw the report because the first thing that popped into my mind was that the lefties can’t seem to figure out what the kids are screwing with them.  So they keep bringing the hammer down on HIGH SCHOOL kids – which will inevitably turn those white high school kids into anti-left wing radicals.The left can’t seem to get it thru their thick heads that THEY are forming up the pissed off young white male army – that is going to throw all their dumb asses into the ovens.In my experience the surest way to get a teenage boy to do something – is to tell him not to do it.When I see teenage boys flirting with Nazism – it makes me think of that incident a few years back where the high school kids were taking the license plates off of local politicians and teacher’s cars – putting the plates onto their own cars – and then speeding thru all the local red light cameras.  The plates would then go back on the car they came from – and the local pols and teachers were all getting slammed with traffic tickets.It was a truly master level gaming of the system.And so is all of this “Nazi” shit.The teenagers are playing you – you dumbasses.

        When Trump declared in his inaugural speech, with his finger dramatically raised in the air, that essentially, poor whites “Will NO LONGER be forgotten,” it put a lump in my throat.  Fast forward to Friday, “We NEED to bring people into this country to work in all these plants that are opening up.”  I don’t know what to say.  Since race IS Our Thing, probably nothing good about Trump again.  This wasn’t just being weak, this was naked betrayal.

        Vince at Red Elephants attended CPAC, and followed up with a good report, calling it a “Cringefest.”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niJ_KubjItkOur side needs more attending these kinds of events.  Vince got a chance to speak to Ted Cruz, and expressed his concern with Big Tech Censorship.  Cruz told him there will be a hearing about it later this month, and gave Vince some contact information.  That’s one example of good things that can happen at these kinds of events.This year’s CPAC should be a call to outnumber and overwhelm the Israel-First crowd next year, and make sure guys like Glenn Beck don’t exactly feel at home there.

            I attended my one-and-only CPAC in 2006.  It was held in Memphis TN at the Peabody Hotel — the one where the ducks come in from their rooftop pen to swim in the lobby fountain for a few minutes.  Just a short distance away from this excitement sat Chris Matthews, pontificating on the various attendees and interviewing some.  The event’s chairman was Dr. Bill Frist, an incredibly ineffective Majority Leader of the US Senate, but a gracious luncheon host at a BBQ place a short distance away (The Rendez-vous).  Other speakers included Sen. John McCain who made a snarky, practically hissssing pitch for his upcoming, ill-fated Presidential run; House Speaker Denny Hastert who snarled his way through some speech, topic forgotten by me.  I did not have a good “feeling” about him then and was not surprised to learn of his awful predations with high school wrestlers in IL.  Sad stuff.  I would have to go back and see an old program to remember anything of value I learned at the event, or if there was anything presented that inspired me to advocate more forcefully for Conservative values and projects.  The guys listed above were pretty much devoid of any positive, “manly” qualities.  A big disappointment.

        When a proton and anti-proton collide you get annihilation, so perhaps there is yet hope for a similar end result with the media whore grifters on both sides of the divide. Don’t be too hard on Trump, he’s playing the hand he’s been dealt. Half of the Republican establishment in DC is seriously trying to kill him and he’s openly mocking them as girly-men. Hillary has more balls than the eunuchs in the entire R senate caucus.

                Assuming that Trump doesn’t face a primary challenger, it would be worthwhile to vote in the Dem Primary for either Gabbard or Andrew Yang if they are still active at the time the primary calendar gets to your state.

                        Roger Simon at PJMedia is supporting Bernie Sanders in the primaries (is Roger actually registered as a Democrat? I doubt it) because of the disruption it would cause; nominating Bernie sends a message to the normies that the Dem party really has gone off the rails.Many years ago, I did something similar in NYC.  Guiliani was running for re-election as mayor .. the estimable first black mayor of NY, David Dinkins, was long out of the picture by then, but the Dem primaries had an assortment of wonderful candidates to choose from.  Ruth Messinger was an old-line red diaper old hag; she could be our first Wymyn Mayor! But the candidate that really got my juices flowing was Al Sharpton. Wow, he would have been great for NY, healing all the racial divisions that Dinkins forgot to tamp down.It’s so hard to choose a good opponent for Giuliani to run against. Messinger had a good chance to win against Guiliani, but Sharpton didn’t.  I made my vote count by voting for Sharpton in the primary. It was a shame he lost to Messie, but at least in the general election Guiliani won.Was it worth it to try to get an unelectableSharpton to run against the candidate I really wanted, Guiliani? Of course! Disrupt your enemies whenever possible.

                Where is.. ahhh…there’s my black pill.. come to Mama. A tish of cognac and down the hatch.. gulp.  On to reality. As for Trump, this is all we get.  Look, he can stand on his head and spit wooden nickels to the tune of clapping fur seals…this is it.  This is all we have currently as a spanner to jam in the ore cart wheels to marginally slow it down.  I was once heard to say I would vote for a wall-eyed peg-legged gay Asian Kikuyu clam named Carl LaFong if he-it-she would slow down the decline.  I’ m not looking for perfection and you bet I’m pissed about immigration of all kinds.  I’ll vote for Gabbard and who the Hell else if I think it will slow the demise.  Operative word is “slow.” And I don’t expect them to do much good either. “Après nous, le déluge.”  Pessimist, yes.  Maybe there will be a white swan event, a black swan event, some kind of societal gob-smack that alters the paradigm and breaks ground for some of the dissident-right seeds to land on fertile soil. Not holding my breath. After what I just read about the Anasazi-grand  MesoAmerican civilization…no..not holding my breath. Too many of the “others” and the angle of repose gets hammered.  So I bitch a lot and keep voting for who ever can slow the civilizational decline before we enact our own national version of the Chinese social credit system.

                    This is pretty much on-point for me.  All this rear echelon field marshalling is way too late.  Trump is, indeed, “all we get,” and we only get that because the uniparty underestimated the power and reach of the new media.  Trump, deeply flawed though he is, represents the limits of what was possible at this very late stage of the decomposition of our culture.The road has been long.  Pick your start point:  the WBTS, or the Whiskey Rebellion, for that matter, or 1913, or most of the amendments past the Bill of Rights – it doesn’t really matter.  The pattern was set in place long, long, ago, and the failures of our forefathers to act when action could have more effect is reflected in the near total loss of the culture that was established for their posterity.You don’t “fix” this.  It has to finish its life-cycle, to rot away, and be replaced by something else.  Fortunately, the same elements which came together to get this ball rolling originally are still in place, although diluted and scattered about.  The more contrast is provided (and the more quickly,) the more the wake-up (clue-stick) happens at the individual level, which is where all large movements have to start.  And, if the indigenous peoples we displaced needed anything besides the accumulated wealth of generations of los Nortes to rebuild their social order and empire, they could have done it very well over the past two centuries without invading us.  It is plunder, pure and simple, aided and abetted by the culture destroyers and their profiteers.Better put all the cards on the table and let this all play out, and the sooner the better, so we can get back to civilization-building from the rubble, something we’re good at.

If said nuts had been in a vice instead of a massaging hand thing would be different today. “Don’t be hard on Trump”, fuck that shit.Trump goes out of the way to fuck himself. Listen to any given FTN since, and including, the infamous black pill episode to get innumerable examples. You used the “dealt card” metaphor. Except, for Orange Man, he was given a straight flush, had a few aces up the sleeve, and x-ray glasses to boot and he still presidents like a shit-sucking retard. He surrounds himself with shit-sucking retards. Trump is so fucking stupid we’ll find out later he was throat fucking AOC under The Resolute desk.

                Like all living things, a nation’s power correlates strongly with energy output, and Trump has deregulated the energy industry such that we are now back on top of that pyramid. He also replaced NAFTA with new agreements that favor the US again, and China is about to knuckle under the same way. And he did both of those things without warfare. The MSM is now regarded almost universally as fake news. That was Trump’s doing. Last but not least, almost everyone in DC hates his guts. You cannot get a higher endorsement than that. Is he perfect? No. But no one else is either.

                Same song and dance as your last anti-Trump posting.  Lots of sound and fury, but little direction to take to correct matters.  When you have a better alternative to Trump, I’m all ears.  Until then I can only conclude you prefer the sweet duplicitous lies of prior politicians to a crude loud mouth who at least attempts to keep some of his promises.

            Trump is his own worst enemy. He surrounds himself with globalist banksters, neo-cons and Bush RINOS. The border is a disaster because Trump listened to these people from day one. He had two years to fix it and did nothing. He let Ryan and McConnell play him like a fiddle.  He talked tough on the border and always backed down afterwards. Big bluffer. He  didn’t even need to do the Nation Emergency on the border. He could have simply taken the funds and ordered the wall built. By going the way he did, the wall will never get built. SCOTUS Roberts will kill it when it reaches him.

They do the old mating dances — the Market Forces Waltz and the Democrats are the Real Racists Two-Step — with one another, hoping to catch a ride on some breeze to the right.It’s easy to make fun of CPAC, but such events do serve a purpose for any movement. They allow participants to get to know each other one-on-one, not just from positions declared and media products. A lot of Trump’s failure is down to his inability to assemble an effective team, and as a result he finds himself marooned in a tempest-tossed sea. He might have done better as a veteran of CPAC-like events, enabling him to find the odd genuine ally among all the grifters.Blogs and YouTube videos can be artificial too. The dissident Right needs its own version of CPAC, more personal and authentic.

            The reason both sides of the political class won’t allow us to have get togethers is exactly that. AmRen gets 300 people to show in the middle of the forest surrounded by an army of security. They would get ten times that if we were permitted the same rights as everyone else. Instead, we have to organize in the shadows.

                This. Allowing Dissident Whites to get together in person and form connections and networks is by far the most dangerous threat to TPTB. Atomized and operating without a home base is the only thing that keeps us in check.The minute that we’re able to offer a functional, safe, open alternative in any aspect of life (particularly political), they’re cooked, and they know it. Their world sucks for any self-respecting white. They can’t allow whites an open alternative. No matter how small it started, it’d grow quickly, gaining power along they and thus accelerating their downfall.I don’t blame them for wanting to kill this baby in the crib. It’s a frickin’ monster.

Yes, but how edgy are they and how much closer are they to being posers? Could they go to a club and throw down? Can they start a strange conversation with a foreign girl unfamiliar to them?

        I went to a Tea Party rally as a teenager.  I’m of the opinion that the Tea Party attracted/prayed on the naive, who thought that voting in the right people was all it took to fix things.If you want to “go back to the Constitution”, then you’re either too inexperienced or haven’t thought your solution through.  But that’s exactly who made up the Tea Party, in my opinion.I’d like to think the dissident Right have a more detailed plan than “get our guys in and repeal everything after 1965”.  We want to wreck the entire system, right?  We want to build something entirely new that mimics what we had before the cult of equality began its dismantlement?  Hopefully since we’re not focused on campaigning for “our guys”, we won’t be so easily separated from our dollars?

        Here’s an example of the state of my local Republican party:
“Why has there been absolute silence from ________ on Ralph Northam’s list of scandals, Justin Fairfax’s alleged sexual assaults, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez’ Green New Deal, and Congresswoman Omar’s anti-Semitic comments and beliefs? It’s shameful. When Republicans do far less in terms of disgracing their offices or proposing radical policies, Democrats rarely avoid comments. But for the last month, this Democrat silence has propagated our state.”
More “Democrats are the real racists/sexists/anti-Semites.” The goals of the state GOP are fighting taxes, taxes, and supporting 2A. Thanks, but no thanks, nnnguys.

        CPAC is a donor class production, so thus will always be heavily tilted to furthering the “invade the world, invite the world” agenda.  But of course only sessions likes Malkin’s generated any excitement.  It certainly does appear that the donor class’s hold on the GOP is weakening.  Kristol, Goldberg, and French don’t seem like really happy guys right now  — the money is drying up.
Throw in the fact that Ilhan Omar and AOC are the biggest gifts to the right in a long time, and things could be going worse.

        The “official right” may now be Trump’s world, as Mr.Z states, but this if far better than sticking your head in the sewage and becoming ,for all intents a purposes, no different than the never-Trumpers.The never Trumpers were/are so full of themselves and their phony, baloney adherence to their true ideology – whatever it is – that they decided to sit home and not vote (thus helping Hillary) or vote for Hillary.Even the most luke warm conservative can see that Hillary would have been 10000 times worse than Trump; just imagine her supreme court picks, her war on US energy production, her zealous climate change agenda, just to name three. items. She would have been an Obama II.But like spoiled brat kids denied cookies before dinner, never Trumpers went off t to their room to sulk.CPAC may not represent what we would wish, no doubt about it.But presently, what they represent – a pro-Trump view – is all that conservatives have right now.At a minimum, they represent the enemy of the greater enemy (that would be progressives/communists/demokrat party), and we all know the saying about the enemy of my enemy.The vast majority of the time we are faced with sub-optimal choices and you have to choose the least worst option.Don’t know about anybody else, but I will take Trump and CPAC any day considering that the other choice is a Hillary/Sanders/Pelosi/AOC/Shiff theatrical presentation.

                I was only in high school at the time, but I can recall the pundit class predicting the end of the GOP and the rise of “post-partisanship”. So the Tea Party was an AED to the Bush-era corpse, which should have got an IED instead. From today’s vantage point, its hard to have sympathy for ordinary people that exercised collective amnesia about their support for the Iraq War. Trump might be the only Republican other than the Pauls to directly criticize GWB.

        An explicitly defined third party, along European lines, may be the only way forward. Sure, it will be the subject of ferocious smear-jobs, deplatformings, firings, and ultimately political imprisonments.
Yeah, that’s bad. But like I said, that may be theonlyway forward. The only wayout.If it could attract even 5% support, it would wake a lot of people up and change the metapolitical situation. A lot of guys romantically call themselves dissidents. But romance without reality is pathetic. That Flight 93 stuff is not joke.

            It is mathematically easier to win GOP primaries in safe seats. This is what DSA does with the Dems. Primary elections have ridiculously low turnout. None of the various Dissident movements has ever gone the trouble of setting up a PAC afiak, which even Stephen Colbert managed to do.
FPTP precludes the emergence of a third party.

                    For more than a decade whites have been moving to whiter areas, blacks have been migrating south to blacker areas, Mexicans dominate SoCal except for a few ritzy coastal areas, etc…Balkanization has been an ongoing process since suburbs started cropping up in the 50s.  We’re going to soon see that trend accelerate.
Since globohomo prefers to do their hiring in Bangalore instead of Bangor the economic attractions of urban areas will wane for YT.

                DBD;A DSA-like organization of our own would be a good thing.  But we’d have to do a better job of candidate (and campaign chair) screening than the DSA did with AOC and her handler, the Hindu-Dindu.Right now it’s looking like the Organs of the Deep State are looking to burn her over campaign finance violations.  Apparently, the Soros money crowd had a would-be candidate beauty contest for the safe seat D districts, picked 5 or so and assigned the contest winners a made-man campaign chair for the primary (and then the general).  Apparently being a barista and Bernie Bro insider wasn’t enough vetting/training, cause they both obviously had their hands in the PAC money cookie jar.OTOH, maybe this is how they normally establish control via kompromat (‘my, my, my, it looks like we got us some campaign finance violations here Mx AOC, POC.  Sure’d be a shame if somebody found out about it.  But you can count on our discretion, IYKWIM’).  In that scenario, AOC was too dumb to know what they meant, so they’re burning her as a lesson to the others to fall in line.Knowing the convoluted campaign finance regs is *supposed* to be the role of a campaign chair in the campaign of a new candidate, after all.  But short time preference can be a problem with S Asians.

                    Disagree, your answer is two-dimensional. AOC is somewhat clueless about the nuances of policy, but that is irrelevant to her base. She was elected on the narrative, and she exceeds every other elected Democrat in terms of self-promotion. Angry women with tons of student debt is not something that we can pretend doesn’t exist.What is more telling about her is that she pretended to be a lesbian during the primary campaign, and used the help of BDS volunteers only to throw them over the side once she won. DSA is probably the most popular club on college campuses, with a dues-paying membership in the tens of thousands. AOC was recruited by her Sociology majoring boyfriend.

                        D.B.D.Not sure why you disagree, doesn’t look like there’s a lot of difference between what we each said about AOC.My intended point, which I could have made better, is to examine the  actions of the enemy and to emulate such of their methods as seem likely to work.  It seems that Soros et al aim to create an above board faction that must be placated to compliment their semi-hidden organizations.  We could do that too.  How_?Run a suitable candidate in safe districts in off year elections which likely feature low turnout, just be a bit more discerning than AOC’s enablers were.  It seems that they got overconfident about their immunity from media criticism

                    It looks like AOC and her chief-of-staff had a nice little campaign fund grift going, and then she accidentally got elected.  The Green New Deal and all that may be the furiously driven squirrel to keep the grift from being looked at.  Same strategy Hillary/Obama have been using on Trump to hide their own foul deeds.

                        I suspect democrats are encouraging AOC spotlight because they want to discredit political challenges from youth politicians on the left. Millenials are now the largest voting cohort and have little reason to vote for septuagenarians unless they can be convinced not to trust anyone under the age of 70. (The inverse of their old “don’t trust anyone older than 30”).Note how frequently Millennials are mocked in the media for their failure to launch and having troubles with “adulting”. On the contrary, as I grew up I realized how ignorant the supposed “adults” were and how little evidence of maturity they actually possess.Funny how social titles skip generations. Political seats passed over Gen X and are now falling on the shoulders of millennials. An old doctor saying goes, “The medical industry only advances every 20 years.” Implying that a generation has to die out before they relinquish power or control.As an aside, I never liked the saying “Absolute power corrupts absolutely” because it infers that all people are equally corruptible in propensity and extent which is ludicrous. It’s a saying with communist undertones, much like “Opinions are like assholes, everyone’s got one and they all stink”.

                            Power’s effect depends on if it is held by those who received it by chance, or if those hungry for it managed to seize it. “Absolute power corrupts absolutely” is quasi-republican, quasi-anarchist propaganda against monarchism.

        Good essay,one of your better posts. The Dissident Right, if it has to succeed has to learn to surreptitiously infiltrate and co-opt events like CPAC. You cannot create alternate platforms, you have run out of time. The best way is to co-opt existing cuckservative platforms. Like it or not, CPAC still commands a wide audience. The infiltration has to be done slowly, one radical idea at a time.

        Don’t forget the Grifter Exclusion principle: Two grifters can’t occupy the same point in space at the same time.And then there’s Schrödinger’s grifter: If you shoot a grifter in a box, is it alive or dead before you open the box to see it?

        The dissident right’s end game is the prize. We need to keep our eyes on it. Grifters to the left of me grifters to the right of me. Half a league half a league half a league onward. They smell like it the look like it and I’m sure they taste like it. They can call it what they want, I call it messin with the kid. Blank CPAC and the horse they road in on. There is something to be said for tea party thinking. It is relevant still. To see the likes of Dick Armey trying to take the concept over was enough to sicken my delicate sensibility. Never give up the ship. Know and deal with the reality in front of us. A spade is a spade. I have seen the enemy. It is not necessarily us. Or me anyway.

        I hope Trump’s embarrassing performance (“I didn’t realize we would need so many new workers”) puts the nail in the coffin of /ourguys/ making excuses for the Orange fraud. (They keep coming back.) I wish we could police these people away from us.Conservatism, Inc. so far has been more interested in destroying us rather than co-opting. The Tea Baggers were a lot easier to deal with since they were just asking for the same crap Republicans always promise (but rarely deliver). I don’t see the GOPe turning younger people who are closed borders, non-interventionist, and critical of tribal influence and “capitalism” into good little NPC’s. It’s why I get so angry when I see the edgelords making excuses for Chump–trying to get us back on that Republican plantation, to borrow a cuck metaphor.

            You aren’t conflating Tea Partiers with Tea Baggers are you? Tea Baggers are homosexuals that participate in an unnatural abhorrent sex act. Tea Partiers wish to be free from punitive taxation at every level. Unless of course you disdain Tea Partiers. No offense meant. Just asking.

                    I know. I was curious if Nathan has something against the Tea Party folks. It was a descriptive Anderson Cooper was fond of. No doubt one of his favorite pastimes.

                        The Tea Party were well-meaning people who had no idea the Leviathan they were up against. They also lacked good leaders and were stuck in the boomercon mindset that Conservatism, Inc. has perfected the co-opting of.Obamacare may be a disaster, but that’s hardly the biggest problem we face, now or then. The one time I visited Sodom-on-the-Potomac it was when the boomer buses dropped off Tea Party protestors against the Affordable Care Act when the SCROTUS was considering the case. It was about as cringy as CCuk. I use “Tea Bagger” more to mock the fecklessness of the movement than the decent people involved.

                The dissident right is an eclectic bunch of misfits, but the core principle is race realism, not taxes. I would gladly exchange the economics of parasitic global-corporatism for a national-socialist government if it is led by competent White Men who are willing to put legacy Americans first.Under the mass immigration policies of the Trump regime, the future of the US Government will have a President named Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and a congress and senate full of her clones. That’s not an exaggeration, you’re just taking the scenic rout while pretending to not notice. If taxes are your only concern, then you’re just a boomercon hoping to die before this becomes a reality.

                    Race realism is the brass ring on the global merry go round. Unless we stop immigration dead in its tracks our slide down the teflon tubes will be far sooner than we like. A Culture of predominately dissident right individuals will not need to worry about punitive progressive taxation. They will not allow it. It is hard for me not to think that all things point to an ethno state. I believe however that may very well be the case. Feckless leadership has ruined more than the Tea Party. We will get more of what we tolerate. We have work to do.

            Once again, Trump is doing the right thing by throwing the code monkeys and science cucks under the bus. Why should he spend political capital to help a demographic that is irreconcilably hostile to him and his base? Every white science dweeb and white code monkey I see is an arrogant virtue signaling shitlib. Training their H1B replacement will give them a much needed dose of reality and humility. The 2000’s resulted in a large number of lolbertarian white code monkeys being redpilled. Time for the lesson again.

                Sadly you’re right too many of science types and code monkeys lean Lefty in a bad way. When looking at pictures of Googles and Facebooks white male employees, they look like Buzzfeeds low Testosterone Soyboys.I lost all respect for them when the tech literati of Silicon Valley and MIT/Cal Tech bent over backwards praising “Clockboy’s” Einstein level genius for dismantling a old RadioShack clock.  He was just a nasty Muslim boy trying to scare his teacher with a fake clock bomb.  And instead people like the head of MIT astrophysics department labeled him a genius.They were so ready to jump on the virtue signalling wagon it was sickening.
