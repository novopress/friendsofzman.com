        Compare Buffett and Carnegie. One acquires wealth and seeks every advantage from government (opposing the Canadian pipeline while his railroad carries that Canadian oil to the States), the other relentlessly reduced the price of steel by a factor of forty times, creating an immense value added, a commercial construction boom and attendant employment, and was broken up by government.Jimmy Madison created a government in which it’s sole function over business was to see that ambition countered ambition–the only true regulation–in matters “both public and private”. What government’s great size and power grants itself now is, rather, a partnership, like the Mafia is partnered with New York City and State business. There are those who seek to do business through it and gain protection from others, and those who are forced to submit to it’s coercion, but no one escapes.Today’s billionaires who are not the Buffet types are entrepreneurs who’s novel industries, because they were new, started outside the government’s regulatory and suffocating grasp, if temporarily. There needs to be nothing  publicly admirable about the men whose vices are usually their virtues.And as Garrett wrote, capitalism is a talent, not an ideology. Academics wrote about the theory after men without theory had already accomplished it. And those men were no less likely to be or become socialist than others. As we continually see.

        You are correct and I was mistaken. I knew that Claudius was murdered. But, he was not poisoned by his wife. She may have been behind the conspiracy, but she did not actually kill him. At least that’s the consensus.
I say that with all due respect, by the way.
Let me also add that I am amazed by some of the people who read my blog.

        Claudius lived a long life and died of old age
No, he was poisoned by his wife (and niece) Agrippina in order to secure the succession for her son, L. Domitius Ahenobarbus (better known as Nero), who eventually poisoned Claudius’ son Britannicus and had his wife Octavia, the daughter of Claudius, exiled and then murdered.
The Julio-Claudians were not a happy family, and Claudius did not come to a “good end”.

        A. Bierce’s Decalogue:Thou shalt no God but me adore:‘Twere too expensive to have more.No images nor idols makeFor Robert Ingersoll to break.Take not God’s name in vain; selectA time when it will have effect.Work not on Sabbath days at all,But go to see the teams play ball.Honor thy parents.  That createsFor life insurance lower rates.Kill not, abet not those who kill;Thou shalt not pay thy butcher’s bill.Kiss not thy neighbor’s wife, unlessThine own thy neighbor doth caressDon’t steal; thou’lt never thus competeSuccessfully in business.  Cheat.Bear not false witness — that is low —But “hear ’tis rumored so and so.”Covet thou naught that thou hast notBy hook or crook, or somehow, got.G.J.

        It seems you have a grudge against the wealthy. I don’t personally feel controlled by billionaires. Most billionaires are successful businessmen going about their lives, albeit with more money and responsibility.
