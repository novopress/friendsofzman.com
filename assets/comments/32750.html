        None of the stories we‚Äôve been told since the year 2000 have been the truth.  9/11, iraq, Afghanistan, 2008, Syria, Ukraine, Covid, Vegas shooter (and that one is a doozy, i‚Äôve heard a hit was out on MBS and shooting up the concert was to cover up the failure) the airliner shotdown over Ukraine (prob first attempt to start the war).  Anyone who believes the offical explanation to those stories has shown themselves to be your enemy üòâ

If you think the lying started with the 2000s or even the 1990s then you are a dangerously gullible person who needs to start doing research and critical thinking.

                    Well they used to do a much better job of it, witness the destruction of OKC Federal Building: such conspiracies can hide in a forest of high(er) social trust and capabilities.  For stuff like the Vegas shooting and Epstein murdercide it‚Äôs like they didn‚Äôt even try, even though social trust is at a point where they really should be trying even harder to keep the ship tight.

                        It‚Äôs all a product of the internet. Millenials don‚Äôt know a time when information was no more than a mouse-click away. If you were a sufficiently tech-savvy X, you could get access to non-Pravda news and opinion through BBSs. And from Millenials on, it‚Äôs  a firehose you can‚Äôt not drink from.
Government is lies. It‚Äôs the only way that kind of business model works.

                ‚ÄúBabies out of incubators‚Äù was an easy story to debunk, but wasn‚Äôt at the time by most MSM.  I know I was immediately enraged until it was pointed out that it was the Kuwaiti ambassador‚Äôs daughter doing the testimony and it was easy to find out she lived with her father in DC during the invasion.However, the part of the whole story that is really meaningful is that this was a show put on by Congress to gin up support for a war they wanted.  Most all these committee ‚Äúhearings‚Äù are show for the public rubes watching.  These committee hearings are held to produce sound bits for political purposes while beating up the people offering testimony.The latest I heard today was a Senator lamenting that the government agencies were not forthcoming in their testimony regarding whatever his committee was ‚Äúinvestigating‚Äù (it really doesn‚Äôt matter).  Of course, the agencies are not forthcoming.  Who the hell is that stupid as to think the process is one seeking truth, rather than a farce.

                    I‚Äôve been in a small rabbit hole of early 1991 sporting events the past couple days and it‚Äôs almost astounding how amped up everyone was for Desert Storm.  My goodness, textbooks could be written about how effectively the public was mobilized to support that war.  And then Bush‚Äôs approval rating was an inconceivable 90% at war‚Äôs end?  That alone should have made any observant person a little uncomfortable.

            The memory-holing of the Vegas incident is the one that sticks out in my mind.
The truth of that incident must be hugely damaging to the Feds.
Otherwise, you know they‚Äôd be using Vegas as a moral cudgel to bludgeon us into further gun control and confiscation.

                There is (at least) one other possible motive for why details of that would be kept quiet: The interests who own the casinos. It would be very bad for business if people thought about mass shootings when they thought about Vegas, so that‚Äôs a motive for them to want the whole thing to go away. In addition to protecting themselves from lawsuits by squelching information as much as possible. And these people have a LOT of political pull.

To be fair, what (logical) explanation can be given for the behavior of the insane?  Not that we know this person was insane, per se, but any number of occurrences of weird events in a country our size can be expected (if that‚Äôs the right terminology).
ÔªøIn a society of lies, skepticism should be the rule of the day I agree for any officially reported event.

Fair point, but was there any evidence of madness offered outside of the act itself? I may have missed it, but there seems to have been a studied lack of curiosity about the shooter‚Äôs background. I can‚Äôt even recall his name off the top of my head, which goes to that point.

                    We‚Äôll never get an explanation, but we have victimology (in the criminological sense). We know who was killed: country music festivalgoers. We know who they are, and we know who wants them dead.
Maybe 2017 was too soon for news that law-enforcement-affiliated leftists are mass murdering ‚Äúchuds‚Äù because the media told them to.
Maybe 2025 is not.

                    But there is an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù conclusion.  Whether one believes such or not is another story.  Here it is (and no, I‚Äôm not that smart, I simply used ChatGPT here}:‚Äù‚Ä¶Key findings included:1.	Fuel Vapors: The center wing fuel tank, which was mostly empty except for residual jet fuel, contained flammable vapors. Due to warm temperatures and the heat generated by air conditioning units located beneath the tank, these vapors became highly volatile.2.	Electrical Malfunction: A short circuit in the wiring outside the tank is believed to have sent a surge of electricity to the fuel quantity indication system inside the tank, creating a spark that ignited the vapors.3.	No Evidence of Missile or Bomb: Despite extensive speculation and conspiracy theories, the NTSB found no physical evidence of a missile strike or bomb. Radar data and physical debris analysis did not support any external cause.Conclusion:The final NTSB report, issued in 2000, determined that the probable cause of the accident was the explosion of the center wing fuel tank, triggered by a short circuit that ignited the fuel vapors inside the tank. The report also recommended several changes to aircraft safety, particularly regarding fuel tank safety and electrical systems, to prevent similar incidents in the future.‚Ä¶.‚ÄùAgain, we seem to be bumping into the end result of A general degradation of society‚Äîdiscussed in detail by Z-man‚Äîwhere the truth no longer matters or has intrinsic value to the majority of our leadership and elite.  Compound this with a populace of declining intellect and you have a recipe for inevitable collapse.We see with Ostei‚Äôs comment a good example here where the best minds in this group no longer trust anything they cannot see, feel, hear or taste.  ;-). A complex society cannot last long under such (deserved) skepticism.I have no solution myself.

                        There was another answer at the time. All kinds of controversy about a navy missile shooting it down. Long story.
If true would it have been better for Clinton to have owned up to such a catastrophic error? We are so good we just shot down one of our flag carriers 747‚Äôs.
they kind of let the truth out for a day way back when and then everyone let it go. As they say..,shit happens.

                        From memory, a popular conspiracy theory for TWA800 was that there had been a Navy exercise offshore and that some type of missile had been fired inadvertently which took out the airliner.I also recall that during the debris recovery and analysis the FBI did find traces of explosive residue but that these were dismissed as being from some type of security training operation. Obviously the Navy would rather cover this up, as such a monumental fuckup is bad for a career. This one suffers from the obvious defect about how difficult it might be to keep dozens ? hundreds ? of sailors quiet.That last one, especially, is either first-rate conspiracy theorizing or a desperate recovery of a bureaucrat trying to cover up something on the fly. If they are made-up (e.g. untrue) they both are better quality yarns precisely because they include ‚Äúrational‚Äù explanation for a ‚Äúcover-up‚Äù.Finally, I recall a claim that historically, there had been several instances where that model of jet had exploded in mid-air. The vast majority of them had been due to explosives, not some internal failure.Make of all this what you will. It‚Äôs from my faulty memory nearly 30 years past, and the original sources were ‚Ä¶ well, not ‚Äúmainstream.‚Äù

                            Yes, I heard the story of an accidental shoot down myself.  However the fact remains that a ship‚Äôs crew of what‚Äî100+ personnel would all remain quite for this period of time?
Note that we had experienced exactly the same situation during the Iraq/Iran war when we shot down a civilian airliner mistaken for an enemy plane attacking.  Not even an attempt of coverup was made.  We acknowledged the shoot down, then acknowledged it was a case of mistaken identity.

            It has been a wild stretch once-big-now-discredited. Enron, Arthur Andersen, the VA.
Denny Hastert, Dan Rather, Brian Williams, Bill Cosby, Subway Jared, Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer, Louis C.K. to name a few.
To top it all off, in 2000 almost all grassroots voters supported the Clintons and Bushes uniformly, but now only a small percentage of each base like either, because Dems concede that the Clintons were rotten and Republicans concede the Bushes were a bad joke.

                    LOL. What did Cooper say about Roosevelt? Did he mention that the US tried to force the UK into war,that the US helped fund the group behind Churchill?
Did he state that Chamberlain said Roosevelt proposed to him on the eve of Munich that the UK declare war on Germany and then the US would follow?
He did none of that: Cooper tries to dump all the responsibility on Churchill and claim naive FDR was bamboozled by the British aristocrat. Cooper and Carlson still believe in the GAE but just think it‚Äôs gotten a little out of hand.

                            Let‚Äôs take it one step further. Roosevelt is basically the same as the German (or Yiddish), Rosenfeld. There sure were a lot of (((them))) in the Low Country, and as a cosmopolitan bunch, nationalities and borders had little meaning. Silent investors in the Opium Trade, and therefore less identifiable? Why not? And recall that the (((leaders))) of the Opium Trade were Great British in nationality, and all of that silver flowing out of China did a lot to address the British trade imbalance with the Chinese (Great Britain being a major theater of operation for the tribe, too). The British and the Dutch, after some wars concerning trade and spheres of influence, had largely composed their differences, and carved things up in Asia. Sometimes wars get in the way of (((business))).

                You are mistaking the Japanese diplomatic codes (Purple), which were broken, with the Japanese Navy‚Äôs code (JN-25) which was not broken until 1942. At no point did the Japanese Navy inform the Japanese diplomats, in any code, what they were up to with respect to Pearl Harbor, because that‚Äôs not how the IJN rolled. Besides, even if that were true, the Navy, by direction of ‚ÄúWheels‚Äù Roosevelt himself, sent out a dispatch to the commanders at Pearl on November 27 that specifically said, in clear English, with no possible confusion of meaning-‚ÄúThis dispatch is to be considered a war warning negotiations with Japan looking toward stabilization of conditions in the Pacific have ceased and an aggressive move by Japan is expected within the next few days‚Ä¶Execute an appropriate defensive deployment preparatory to carrying out the tasks assigned in WPL 46‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe commanders at Pearl did not execute an appropriate defensive deployment, as they were ordered to, a week before December 7. There is no conspiracy. What there was, in abundance, was incompetence, hubris, and stupidity.

            I‚Äôve never been a ‚Äúconspiracy theorist.‚Äù I don‚Äôt believe in Bigfoot or UFOs or aliens at Area 51.However, actual conspiracies DO exist. The Treaty of London in which the British and the French secretly agreed to cede Austro-Hungarian territory to Italy in exchange for her joining the Allies is one example. The Sykes-Picot deal in which they agreed to divvy up the Levant is another example.Deep Throat turned out to be Mark Felt, who was an actual Deep Stater trying to backstab Nixon for not appointing him Director of the FBI.Governments do this kind of underhanded shit all the time. In instances where they are not directly involved in rigging things behind the scene, they are always trying to control the narrative to put themselves in the best light.The Kennedy assassination is an example of this. If Oswald was a CIA/mob/Mossad/MKULTRA patsy, they would naturally want to hide that. But if Oswald was genuinely a communist nut who acted alone and shot the president after defecting to the USSR and returning to the U.S., he would have been a high-priority security risk only one year after the Cuban missile crisis. If the FBI failed to monitor him adequately and allowed him to slip through the cracks, they would naturally want to hide their incompetence as well.Deliberate conspiracy or not, people in power almost always have something to hide.

            I looked up MBS and got Mohammed bin Salman the Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia. I guess I‚Äôm just not up on Saudi politics. Well, who knows. Our country is a hall of mirrors now.

        I can‚Äôt say I know much about the reason behind the guys trying to take out Trump, but the plandemic certainly had orders coming from the top.

            I had two doctors I saw regularly leave the profession after Covid. Both of them saw me during the ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù for unrelated concerns and spent most of the appointment time coercing me to get the jab. Both acted uncharacteristically cloying and fake, and one lost his temper and started describing in graphic terms what would happen to my lungs if I got Covid.I had the creepy feeling both times that they were acting, and that there was no purpose in arguing with them or asserting myself. I simply said no thank you, doctor. And as I say, both quit and went into ‚Äúpublic health‚Äù administrative positions in academia and no longer practice.Odd thing about both incidents was that I had the same feeling arise in me that I had as a kid a few times when an adult in a car or in a position of authority was trying to coerce me into something I didn‚Äôt want. Immediately set off some kind of instinctive alarm that they wanted something from me for their own gratification and were prepared to use psychological coercion or worse to get it.

        the utility of the Iranian assassins story is pretty straightforward: It allows them to use professionals. Currently, they have to use a collection of retards who find ways to fail at the assignment.You have to feel bad for them, they get one of their retards to within 140 yards of Trump and the loser finds a way to miss. They get another one on the exact golf course at the exact time ‚Äì this one is smart enough to camp out for 12 hours, but is stupid enough to stick the barrel of the crappiest SKS ever seen out of the bushes. Honestly, though, this is what you get when you have to use retards.The Iranians, though. Well, that‚Äôs a great idea. It allows you to use guys who are not complete retards ‚Äì who can reliably make an easy shot and then can plausibly get out of the country. Might even be able to pull off that one of them left his Iranian passport behind or some absurd shit like that.Trump dead. Iran blamed. That‚Äôs a good day for the secret police.

                If that was really his rifle, and Trump really would have been within 50 yards, iron sights would have been more than enough.

            Serious assassins probably don‚Äôt bring a GoPro on their assignment.¬†I‚Äôve speculated     n the July case) that a crucial flaw is that no professional assassin would ever take such an assignment, under the very rational fear he‚Äôd be caught and/or killed, which is precisely what the two cases this year obtained. On the other hand, there are plenty of mentally unstable nuts running around. We don‚Äôt (or at least I don‚Äôt) know much about the July Guy, who seems to have left few breadcrumbs, although the few he did are odd, like being in a BlackRock ad. On the other hand, Routh the Mouth had plenty of major and social media presence, not to mention serious criminal charges, far and wide for all to see.¬†Of course the CT aficionado will always revise his explanations to accommodate new information. I suppose that MKULTRA or other Bourne type trained killers is possible, but the supply of loose nuts is far more ample than mind controlled automatons.That the Secret Service could screw up so badly, especially in the July case, might be incompetence or is there malevolence too? The September attempt, at least, puts the SS in a better light, although how Routh got detailed information stayed off the radar etc. should invite suspicion.

        The ‚ÄúIranians are out to get Trump‚Äù stories have been fed to the media for some months now. Maybe priming the public for something?Trump gets offed and a perp ‚Äì Ali Harvegh Oswalid, an Iranian national ‚Äì is gunned down at the scene by our valiant Secret Service. Cue anti-Iran war hysteria, and all those MAGA White Boys from the South who hitherto have been reluctant to join the new woke, incompetent and homo GAE military are now thirsting to avenge their dead Fuhrer.
How convenient ‚Äì for all the parties who believe they stand to benefit.

I actually feel as though the DC Marxists are being a little too aggressive in moving against Adams at this point.
Yes he was grumbling about the invaders, but was he really getting any traction with anyone?
I get DC wants to enforce ideological conformity, but I think this move is going to backfire on them a bit with certain constituencies.

            One of Diddy‚Äôs former body guards claims that the Federal Investigations of Eric Adams and his entourage has everything to do with Diddy‚Äôs problems.
On the other hand, some have said that Diddy has kompromat recordings on Heels Up Kamala, and that the deep state is willing to throw everyone under the bus to deflect from her. Hollywood and that crap they call music hasn‚Äôt been real profitable lately, so maybe they have decided to pull the plug on it all and restart anyhow.

                                This is one of things that always struck me weird about the me too thing.  Those women did not have a gun put up to their head to do that crap with weinstein.  They had a choice and they decided money and fame was worth it to throw away dignity and self respect.  Says as much about them as him.  Also goes into what i was saying a few days back about corruption.  You can‚Äôt tolerate it, otherwise it grows like weeds.

                                    I think you are as mistaken now as you were then. Unless one is hyper-competent enough to overcome the minority set-asides and the HR preferential hires and promotions, his options are to either take advantage of whatever he can or be like the Rs, the noble losers.

                    One good thing about this Diddy Thing is that if all of the rump ranger zigaboos fall out of the tree, if may so discredit that crap that no one will ever want to listen to it again. It‚Äôs hard to be credible when about squalling about their hos if everyone knows they really like skinny snow white boys. Good things do come out of the imperial collapse of your nation, every now and then.

                That‚Äôs certainly an interesting theory. I submit that even if somebody has videos of Heels dispensing her favors freely to all of Hollywood over a period of years, on the average our moral standards have eroded to the point where I doubt the average Democrat would be dissuaded from voting for her. They would vote for Satan‚Äôs wife before they‚Äôd cast one for Big Orange.

                I was wondering about that.  Kamala was certainly moving in the same social circles at the same time as those Diddy parties.  Would not surprise me if she got extra drunk / high there and was filmed doing crazy stuff.  Makes sense for the FBI raids that took all the blackmail materials for their own purposes.

            ‚Ä¶and the Uniparty (represented here by DoJ) can sanctimoniously assert, ‚ÄúSee? We‚Äôre non-partisan‚Ä¶we go after Democrat bad actors, too.‚Äù Heck, they prosecuted and convicted a sitting President‚Äôs son for tax and firearms charges. No questions, please, about dealings in Ukraine or who knows what else.The desired message is of course that our Federal government is objective, impartial and enforces the laws impersonally.The unstated message for anyone playing the game is, of course, quite the contrary. The regime will be used to go after whomever is the political enemy of the day. For the accelerationist, that‚Äôs actually a good sign: It means that the various factions in power know that their favored (or at least, absence of disfavored) status can change with the next gust of wind.

        Great article on these very strange and confusing times.After the Biden insertion, a friend of mine was telling me about how distraught her husband had become over Trump‚Äôs loss. He had been sure Trump would win and firmly believed it was stolen. I forwarded a fantastic post from Zman about Jan 6 and Ashley Babbitt to her and asked her to share it with her husband. She couldn‚Äôt get over the fact that a pseudonym was used by the author. She kept asking me why he didn‚Äôt post under his real name, etc.  I don‚Äôt think she even shared it with him. It was so frustrating and ridiculous. It‚Äôs also really unfortunate because her husband remains lost and confused. I think there are many out there who are in the same boat.It‚Äôs got to be awful to watch all the shenanigans and craziness while still somehow believing in the system. And even worse, not fully realizing that the entire system is rigged against them and their children because of their race.

            Quite naive of her.  But really, how do you explain the reality of the Left and your exposure to their ‚Äúretaliation‚Äù for expressing a contrary view to their orthodoxy?   For every car I see with ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù-type stickers, I see perhaps 6 or more with Leftist sentiments.  The simple reason is that all my friends know that to place such bumper stickers on their vehicle is to invite vandalism.The values of the Left are not the same as of the Right.  Free speech (for Rightest views) not being one of them.  Since your friend seems to espouse a more Leftist bent of mind, you‚Äôd only insult her with my explanation.Way back when at university, the faculty and staff would pin Christmas cards outside their office walls and door.  Most were from vendors and former students and brought back memories of those interactions.  In the early 80‚Äôs, I got a ‚Äúrandom‚Äù Christmas card from President Reagan (Yep, they sent out those and any number specifically to important people‚Äîof which I am not!).  I thought it was a ‚Äúhoot‚Äù, and the card was quite beautiful with picture of Nancy and Ron, so I pinned it on the wall next to my office door with the others.  It lasted perhaps two days before it was vandalized.  So began my understanding of Leftist thinking and values.

                Twenty or so years ago I had the temerity to affix a bumper sticker saying, ‚ÄúI revere Christ and country, therefore I am not a liberal‚Äù* on my car. Less than a week later somebody busted out the drivers‚Äô side rear window. And this in a conservative West Texas city, albeit one housing a sizeable university.

        One thing that dissidents get wrong about the government is these different agencies are in lockstep. The FBI/CIA/ATF and the other ones are in constant and often bloody behind-the-scenes competition for government money, influence and attention from the carnies in the media. Look at the Branch Davidian siege where the ATF went in with guns blazing, got their asses kicked and the FBI took over command.Our armed services, despite all of this ‚Äújoint‚Äù claptrap, are much the same way. The Marines are the best at fighting battles on Capitol Hill and the services all are in competition for money and influence.The joke in WWII is that the Japanese Army and Navy wanted to fight each other more than they did the Allies and that is true for our governmental agencies.We still have no answers on the Las Vegas shooting. It‚Äôs been memory-holed. That‚Äôs one of many incidents that seem odd that are just buried by the regime water-carrying carnies  in the media.

        People tend to think of the government, or governmental departments as black boxes.   The Feds did this, or The FBI did that.But the government is a sprawling, decentralized organization of millions of people. Even small government agencies have tens of thousands of employees.  The idea that everyone inside such an organization works toward one coherent objective is pretty crazy. Especially as America has had civil service protections for the bureaucrats in this organizations for more than a century. And worse,  the culture of government has been one of unaccountability for generations.No one is ever held accountable for anything . And have not been for the entire career of the average bureaucrat at this point.   Most people will respond to that environment with sloth and inactivity.  But some will push the boundaries of behavior until they get pushback.  Absent that they‚Äôll slid into explicit criminal activity and criminal conspiracies.With the size of government, overall, those few will number in thousands.

        The lack of explanations Zman astutely recounts here is one blade of the proverbial scissors. The other ‚Äúblade‚Äù is the general public‚Äôs willingness to accept prima facie absurdities without any apparent ruckus. People have just become accustomed to it for some reason. Sixty years from the Warren Commission, through Vietnam and NAFTA/ WTO, WMD, Covid blah blah, callouses have formed. Or nearly everyone is entirely focused on trying to pay their grocery bills.

                        I used to live a mile down the road from a G.E. factory in Owensboro, Kentucky, that built transformers and other such power line equipment. I also remember when they shut it down, fired all the workers, and moved the production overseas.
I have said for sometime that the real collapse of America will be due to the lack of domestically manufactured goods and parts.

        What this suggests is that maybe there is no general conspiracy at work, but rather a breakdown of control at the top.Related but not entirely the same is the likelihood of factional division and internecine warfare, which is a hallmark of unsettled totalitarian regimes in their late stages. It certainly would explain the contrary stories planted in the Regime propaganda organs about alleged Iranian assassins. One faction obviously wants a pretext for a third and successful assassination attempt. The other or other factions want to burn the faction laying the groundwork to murder Trump. It most likely is the TLA‚Äôs and intelligence services pushing the assassination, and the few remaining sane military leaders in opposition. Given the opaque nature of who actually is in control, no one on the outside can tell who is who for certain (most on the inside likely are uncertain as to who has the upper hand).A strongman usually keeps factional divisions to a minimum in entrenched police states. There obviously are wannabe strongmen, strongwomen and strongxhers going at it in the increasingly retarded GAE. Since all elected politicians are or become puppets in the GAE, none of them are positioned to emerge as someone to give the order or to countermand the plot to murder Trump. Even stupid Americans are realizing what a fraud the Regime is even though abundance keeps them fat and happy. The kabuki opposition from the controlled GOP, to cite one example, is totally transparent now.It all will continue in a shambolic, moronic fashion until the gibs run out, at which point it implodes in a nanosecond.

            When I read the news about the Adams indictment in NYC I thought his explanation that it was payback for pushing back against getting flooded with illegals was reasonable.  Then I wondered why the Turks were bribing the mayor of New York City in the first place. Adams is on the older side and a joke of a politician, this is as high as he was going to go. What do they get out of paying him off?  The whole system makes no sense. A system breakdown could explain part of it.  I hope we are heading to an implosion, but it is tough to sort out now.

                The Adams thing is hard to understand given the timing. It could be as simple as foreign bribes are reserved for the federal level and a local apparatchik got uppity and cut into their action, but still, why now?

                            Yep.  What I noted about ‚ÄúIdiocracy‚Äù first was an acceptance/premise of genetically induced decline in intelligence due to over breeding of the ‚Äústupid‚Äù and under breeding of the ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù.  Really, in 2006, the issue of genetic determination of intelligence was still being fought vigorously in academia and such notions were considered a ‚Äúcareer ender‚Äù for young faculty.

            I read on some anonymous police blog that child porn is what they charge you with when they‚Äôve got nothing. Either they plant it, or they search your devices, find some porn, charge you with child porn and then leave it to you to prove the subject is of legal age, which is practically impossible to do.

        It‚Äôs becoming clear that the DOJ, FBI, CIA, etc. can no longer be seen as cohesive entities, but a number of fiefdoms vying for power among the general bureaucracy to the point where there are so many nodes that no one knows what‚Äôs going on anymore.Since no one can ever get fired, there‚Äôs no way to reinstall order since once someone gets a position, it‚Äôs basically a lifetime appointment for them to run wild in. It‚Äôs also why the ‚Äúhead‚Äù of these departments are empty-headed dunderheads to avoid anything that shakes the current status quo.While it‚Äôs going to create roguishness unlike anything that‚Äôs ever been seen, this is good for us. They have no cohesive base and are just a bunch of internally squabbling kingdoms that are increasingly incapable of ruling.

The plan the media is telegraphing now is to kill Trump, blame Iran, and thereby Americanize Israel‚Äôs war. The American military thinks that a Muslim-murdered Trump will reverse white flight from the uniform. A joint mission clearlyexists.

        The regime‚Äôs schemes and dishonesty are the lesser mystery. That does not mean I know all the answers to all the questions, but at least we can be assured that the regime, and/or various factions within it, are acting in what they believe to be their own interest. So in that sense it is not so mysterious.The greater mystery is all the many millions of retarded dupes who still believe, even after what we have all witnessed in the last 8 years, what is propagated in the regime‚Äôs media. Often they are otherwise seemingly intelligent people. This truly boggles the mind. I know it‚Äôs not impossible or even difficult to recognize that you‚Äôre being lied to by the regime‚Äôs media, I should know, because I used to be one of those people who believed them, and I ended up over here for this very reason.There was a time when people could be forgiven, or at least understood, for believing what they were told, but it is many years in the past, and today there is no longer any explanation or excuse for why anyone would believe one single word of it, other than willful stupidity.

            There seems to be a significant minority of folk who will always follow ‚Äúwhat the people on the TV say‚Äù even if means doublethink, holding two contradictory opinions simultaneously (e.g. ‚ÄúYou need to get the COVID vaxx to protect yourself and others even though it doesn‚Äôt protect yourself and others.‚Äù).They seem to think that by following the crowd they‚Äôll somehow be safer.But:‚ÄúEnter ye in at the strait gate: for wideisthe gate, and broadisthe way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:Because straitisthe gate, and narrowisthe way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.‚Äù(Matthew 7:13-14)

Plenty the blob want expanded war with Russia.The second shooter had all kinds of crazy stuff in his bio.  Volunteered in Ukraine, and when rejected, tried to be a recruiter for the cause?  Bizarre.  This, too, seemed to have some kind of rabbit hole narrative to distract and to force a course of action when the ‚Äútruth‚Äù was discovered.All of it seems like a poorly written made-for-tv script.

        I remember how alone I felt about this kind of thing in the dark age before the internet.  Prior generations of my family were pretty cynical and grandparents/great-uncles filled me in on things like the Pearl Harbor scam and others early in life ‚Äì but among my peers I was alone in knowing those things.  I‚Äôm glad more people who actually do give a damn about truth have a chance to put a few more pieces together.  Alas, none of us will ever see the whole rotten picture.The various extreme examples cited by other commentors are excellent, but I find value in other more mundane revealings as well.  A personal example ‚Äì during WW2 my grandmother was a pretty young woman from a good family, and someone nearly talked her into joining up with one of those ‚Äúservice‚Äù outfits. My great uncle, already in the Army, caught wind of it and immediately returned home in a rage to set her straight ‚Äì the US Army was making whores of those girls, so he was having none of it.  (She went to work in a bomber factory instead.)  Back in those better days when American males had the sense to control misguided female family members.  This anecdote helped me to see early on just how rotten the whole damn show is.   Death to ZOG.

                I would guess Jill and her staff put the meeting together so she could pretend to be President for a couple of hours. The Cabinet showed up because many of them are just as dull and deluded as Jill and those who would have objected were promised something in return for their cooperation with the photo op.

                        I had never bothered to look at who was in Biden‚Äôs Cabinet. The best could be described as mediocre, most are total dunces like Lloyd Austin. He has hardly had any turnover at all with the only two major members leaving being Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh who left to become Director of the NHL Players Association and HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge who most likely left due to extreme incompetence.  These people aren‚Äôt angling for other jobs as the administration winds down which makes me think Zman is right and they have privately been told they get to stay if Harris wins. No wonder they agreed to play along with ‚ÄúPresident Jill.‚Äù

                        ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù Jill has been LARPing her whole life.  When I was a young grad student in the PhD program, I had a major professor who brooked no ‚Äúego‚Äù. He was merciless to a recent PhD student of his who had his secretary book him a room at a conference as ‚ÄúDr. so &amp; so‚Äù!Indeed, when the hotel agent addressed him as ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù, my major professor asked loudly when he graduated from med school?  It was a classic ‚Äúdress down‚Äù and probably mostly made for the rest of us budding PhD students standing around.  As he later related to us, the title doctor was relegated to MD‚Äôs and such.  This was even the case then in the AP Style manual, but seems to have been dropped/relaxed/ignored so we can address most of our new class of minority overloads with exalted, but weakly earned titles.  I put Jill Biden into that category as well.My major professor however pulled no punches with MD‚Äôs either.  He called them the only profession so damn insecure as to address *each other* as ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù!  üôÇ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù Jill Biden holds an Ed.D (Doctor of Education), not a Ph.D, in ‚ÄúEducational Leadership‚Äù from the University of Delaware awarded in 2007. Supposedly, her ‚Äúdissertation‚Äù focused on ‚Äúretaining students in community colleges‚Äù.When I was a student, the Ed.D was awarded *without* thesis requirement at all from the College of Education.  Typically the MS thesis is a ‚Äúsummary‚Äù of a scientific area of study, whereas a PhD Dissertation was an ‚Äúoriginal contribution‚Äù to/within the area of study.The main point here is that at that time, there was a chasm of difference between students who completed the simple taking of course work, and those who could undertake the rigors of experimental design, analysis, and publication.  The ‚Äúderogatory‚Äù term for such was ABD‚Äîall but dissertation.  Those folk were legion and at the university held in low regard.  I don‚Äôt hold an Ed.D in much higher regard.

            If there is another attempt, it will probably have to be more sophisticated, necessitating the involvement of a state level actor. Hence the Iran cover story. A ‚Äúlone nut‚Äù won‚Äôt cut it.
The more interesting question is why Trump is giving it credibility. Maybe he figures it‚Äôs his best chance to stay alive. Give the Zionists their war, and pit them against the Neocon Ukraniacs. Exploiting the ancient enmity between German and Russian Jews is pretty clever, actually.

        Occam‚Äôs Razor. The Federal Government has been infiltrated and taken over by a cabal of globalist stooges that are covertly working to impose a techno-tyranny. Trump represents an existential threat to their plans and they are seriously trying to kill him before the election. CIA is in the lead and using Ukrainian assets. Iran is just distraction that serves Netanyaho‚Äôs interests. Plus, someone has to be blamed when they succeed. No plan survives contact with the enemy. When it goes hot, that will be unpredictable.

        Like I‚Äôve said for a while, we‚Äôre way under the Do Long Bridge now, and the four factions of the Regime are panicking, which is an indication that, contrary to the doom mongers, the Bad Orange Man could be elected in November regardless of the fraud built into the system. Everyone is jockeying for power regardless of who comes out on top, because that necessitates a reordering of the factions, within the factions themselves, because these people hate each other like poison, personally, in a way that transcends ideology or money.

        All of the ‚Äúpretty people‚Äù decry conspiracies supposedly because nobody can keep a secret.  Yet, these same people know we classify over a million documents a year.
Most conspiracies only ever really fall apart when the authorities start offering immunity for snitching and life imprisonment if convicted.  But when the authorities are in on it, they threaten life in prison for snitching and immunity and money for keeping your mouth shut.

            Problem with this though is there is someone who goes home, kisses his wife, throws the football with his son, goes to bbqs volunteers at the church, who tells all of the people in his life lies about serious things. He knows most of what they think is real are little movies he helped make. This is just not within the ability of humans.
the idea that there is not a small sized class of people who lie to everyone all the time is not in accord with human nature. They would be gods.

        The managerial class is united against the dirts. But yes, they have different ideas about how to immiserate the average bloke (who needs to be replaced with the joyous diversity). How to effect ‚Äúchange‚Äù in other words. That coupled with the competency crisis explains a lot.

        Watched the intro to a video called ‚ÄúHow Europe Stole the World‚Äù yesterday. Standard Lefty whining about corporations, which I agree with up to a point. Didn‚Äôt need to see more, but it got me thinking.So the English colonies at least (I‚Äôd guess Dutch too, maybe all of them) were corporations, more or less, meaning they were investors backed by the state, with employees (colonists). Massachusetts Bay Company, Virginia Company, etc. Before that, what? The Crown granted lands and titles, or something like that, meaning the Crown ultimately owned everything. Private government.So nobility, patrimony, and proprietorship are replaced with this legal person, which is a collective of sorts that you buy your way into. Sounds pretty liberal and democratic to me! Sure enough, private government is eventually replaced with public government, aristocracy (the best) gets replaced with the common majority, and the ultimate authority of God gets replaced with the Almighty Dollar.I‚Äôm sure this is all 101 stuff, but I wonder if these Lefties who bitch about money and corporations really know what they‚Äôre bitching about.Fast forward a few centuries, and the open society, i.e., idiocracy shot through with foreigners and organized crime, looks inevitable.PS Pennsylvania was a proprietorship, and Billy Penn ran it mostly as a utopian project which, oddly enough, worked pretty well. IIRC.

            William Penn could be pretty realistic, but yes, he established Quaker government in his colony, while also allowing other Christians to settle there. He believed in a balance of ‚Äúfreedom of conscience‚Äù with a government that acted severely against crimes. The Quakers in those days and for a long time afterwards were very conservative socially. They didn‚Äôt tolerate bad, antisocial, criminal behavior at all. Violent criminals were dealt with effectively, and things like gambling, fornication, and swearing were considered offenses. Fascinating stuff.Penn was only able to spend a couple of brief periods in Pennsylvania, and while he was gone, politics in the colony became very factional. Penn had grown up in royal court circles, in which he sometimes was able to skillfully navigate, but the factions which arose in the colony disappointed him. He also was friends with James II, and they worked together for religious tolerance, but when James was ousted Penn was threatened with treason, and had to lay low for a while. A sad story sometimes, but as you said, overall Pennsylvania worked well. Conflicts arose between the Quaker establishment and others, including Scots-Irish and Anglicans who wanted to fight the French and Indians, but things gradually settled down well.Sorry to go on, but it‚Äôs so interesting to me, and the colonial period offers a lot of good instruction, with successes and failures.

                Rights + discipline sounds good to me. Freedom isn‚Äôt free, as they say.Anther thing I find interesting: I‚Äôve read PA was an AnCap paradise, or at least the most capitalist (in the ideal sense) of the colonies. I don‚Äôt have an informed opinion on that, but it makes sense. I‚Äôd guess it was a consequence of a colony of mostly small freeholders. Kind of an odd spin on utopia.OTOH, by the late 19th century, the Commonwealth was deforested and degraded. The state set about purchasing large, mostly-abandoned tracts. That‚Äôs how we got our state parks, state forests, and game lands.Maybe the notion of discipline should‚Äôve extended to land ownership, too.

                    ‚ÄúRights + discipline sounds good to me. Freedom isn‚Äôt free, as they say.‚ÄùSame with me! And yes, as I recall, the Quakers were very commerce-oriented, as were some of the Pennsylvania Dutch. And both groups tended to be very good and conscientious with farming, at least in the early years, and among my ancestors. My grandfather was an organic farmer, following ideas of Louis Bromfield I believe, long before organic became hip. Those early Quakers had the philosophy of building things to last, and stewarding the land. But as you described, not everyone followed that.David Hackett Fischer wrote a good overview about this stuff in his book Albion‚Äôs Seed, if anyone is interested.

        The explanation is regime factionalism. Contra a comment down below (just disagree) factionalism always exists in every regime, and it does indeed matter. It matters if Beria or Zhukov/Khrushchev wins. It can indeed always get far worse.It seems to me that factionalism, and lack of competence due to DEI / AA  and feminist policies seems to drive the failures we see at the regime levels.Musk with Brazil was the military faction unhappy that Biden‚Äôs people installed Lula over Bolsanaro and predictably Lula allowed Chinese (and possibly Russian) spy bases in on the Brazilian Atlantic coast and ports. The Supreme Court Justice there is corrupt and sought to shut down discussion of just which bribes he had taken on behalf of big business. Likely that effort by the military faction has been written off.Eric Adams clearly is the result of a purge, directed by AOC, and the Squad and backed up by Letitia James to install the anti-police, anti-Saturday people Public Advocate so as to defund the police and go after the Saturday people. Hence friendly DOJ people going after Adams. Just as I predicted, NYC will soon be Detroit squared, contra Steve Sailer. Who overestimates money vs power. Like betting on Crassus vs. Caesar.Over at the FT, the hindu dindu has a column up calling for, in so many words, the abolition of even the facade of elections and instead permanent managerial rule by elites. A signal that if Trumps wins big enough to forestall a cheat, the managers may just abolish elections like Zelensky and rule permanently.

        I think the regime is in crisis. Blinken and Sullivan (representing the Blue Empire) are ready for Austin and the Puzzle Palace to send their guys to bleed out on the Pontic Steppe, while Austin and the boys in khaki and green who man the Red Empire are apparently having none of it.An aircraft carrier over there is without its escorts because we only sent one USNS oiler which its captain managed to run aground, and believe it or not, there is a shortage of commercial volunteers to join the party and the Merchant Marine doesn‚Äôt do that stuff.The brass at least has the sense to realize that Pooty Poot may not be kidding about the canned sunshine for NATO. Blinken doesn‚Äôt care because killing Russians honors his ancestors.

        I‚Äôm thinking, if anything, these shots on Trump are making the argument to the public, albeit unsaid, that why vote for a guy who‚Äôs just going to get shot a few months into office.  Why waste your vote?
That may be good enough to dissuade some fence-sitters

        What this suggests is that maybe there is no general conspiracy at work, but rather a breakdown of control at the topi think that Irish guy called those who thinks everything is a conspiracy and that everything is going to some clever plan, schizoids.what makes for trust? Personally it was a few things like Waco , ruby ridge, Asange, and the spy who‚Äôs in Russia now I forgot his name. But the big one for me was weapons of mass destruction.it‚Äôs a good thing to think about how we believe what we believe. What would have to happen to trust again. Sounds gay but it‚Äôs true

            All we know for certain is that the US government is at the root of it all.  Good possibility that it‚Äôs a case of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing, but ultimately it is the same body.

        Good post and good conclusion, I feel it is correct, they have lost control of their factions and the factions have lost control of their monkeys.

        The Conservative Treehouse has the best explanation. Judas goats have been sent out all over the system pushing the right buttons to make this stuff happen. These Judas goats are either working for Trump or parties friendly to Trump or using Jeffrey Epstein blackmail to make them do what they are doing. Just the lawsuits alone wouldn‚Äôt happen under ordinary circumstances. Somebody has a gun to their heads. This is a mass psyop to illustrate how ‚ÄúI was just following orders‚Äù works.Trump friendly media is also there to capture it and to fan out over social media. Don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs funny how things like a plane going down carrying Loretta Fuddy, the woman who allowed Zero‚Äôs birth certificate to get inserted into the Hawaiian birth certificate records? Have a plane goes down, she‚Äôs the only one that dies, and they‚Äôre just happened to be some video where anons, through crowdsourcing, notice a diver jump out of the water, presumably poking Fuddy was something to give her a heart attack or whatever she died from?This stuff is happening over and over again because it is being staged so that we talk about it and understand what really goes on in our government. There is no other explanation for the same thing happening over and over again.

            Hard passAn American adaptation of the Israeli show of the same name, ‚ÄúEuphoria‚Äù follows the troubled life of 17-year-old Rue, a drug addict fresh from rehab with no plans to stay clean. Circling in Rue‚Äôs orbit are Jules, a transgender girl searching for where she belongs; Nate, a jock whose anger issues mask sexual insecurities; Chris, a football star who finds the adjustment from high school to college harder than expected; Cassie, whose sexual history continues to dog her; and Kat, a body-conscious teen exploring her sexuality. As the classmates struggle to make sense of their futures, the series tackles the teenage landscape of substance-enhanced parties and anxiety-ridden day-to-day life with empathy and candor.
