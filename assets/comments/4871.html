        …I’m not as sure as Ganderson that Howie’s audience would find Pao “not guilty”.BTW, Pao is only half of a very special power couple.Pao’s husband also has his own interesting business history:Case builds against former NY hedgie ‘Buddy’ Fletcherhttp://nypost.com/2015/02/18/case-builds-against-former-ny-hedgie-buddy-fletcher/

            Only head shots are available on the web- but she seems attractive to me!

                Sorry Ganderson.No need for the exclamation point.Beauty, as they say, is in the eye of the beholder.I thought she was perhaps a 6 to 6+.I wasn’t sure if that was high enough to clear Howie’sdemanding standards.Reasonable men can of course disagree about this.No offense intended.
Anyway, it’s good to see that Howie’s fans intersect here at the Zman blog.All the Best,Nedd

                    It’s interesting that so many of my readers are also Howie Carr listeners. Maybe I should start send Howie material from my blog.

                    None taken- an honest discussion among like-minded individuals! I should also mention that I have a touch of the yellow fever, so that could be an influence as well. And … try not to let all this destroy your faith in the integrity of the mentally disturbed grifter community!

        I think the fact that Ellen Pao is “not guilty” in the Howie Carr sense has something to do with her continually being hired.

            Yeah, I’m thinking the phrase “me boom-boom long time” comes up in her interviews.

        “new employees to engage with the community”What the hell does this mean, in non-Newspeak? When I worked, we engaged with the community all the time: you either provided what they wanted at a price they were willing to pay at a cost that didn’t crush the business (and with it the people who made it happen) or you stopped doing it and, er, went bust.Doing the job was ‘engaging with the community.’ Selling the things they used was ‘engaging with the community.’ But no one said ‘engaging with the community.’ It was very much a case of  ‘Find out what they want and what they’ll pay and if we can afford it, we”ll do it.”Still, as Newspeak it is doubleplus good these days so it makes sense(?) that out of touch CEOs issue statements like this.
