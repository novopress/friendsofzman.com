        The important thing is to keep the gays away from the children.  For this reason homosexuality should be illegal, but seldom enforced – only if someone is proselytizing near the schools. Outlawing homosexuality would assure that none would ever get to adopt, too.Kids are susceptible to bad ideas, coercion by elders, easily bribed, and they are CUTER. Many end up attracted to people like their first crush, gays are all about thinking with their crotches, they likely started early with whoever they had access to.Our forced “acceptance” of homosexuality has now resulted in constant propagandizing of school children, in the name of “anti-bullying”.Notice the surge of transgendering? – be assured there’s a surge in homosexual acts amongst teens, it’s just easier to keep hidden. Kids are getting deeply traumatized for the sake of adults who want to rub societies nose in excrement.

        I think I read that article too, Vince!  It might have been in the old American Spectator.  The hippy fad for “free” and “natural” life – hair uncut, bodies unwashed, babies without diapers doing what comes naturally in the open air – had reproduced an environment out of the medieval era.

        “But, there may be downstream consequences we have not considered. There is a reason, after all, why it has never been done.”Read an article some time ago, by a doctor who worked at a free clinic in San Francisco in the late 1960’s. Their patients tended to be young, hippie types, living in communes with all that that entailed back in the day. He said they were seeing rashes, STDs, and other diseases that they had only seen in old textbooks — stuff that disappeared with the advent of indoor plumbing. His point was, “listen to your mother” — she may not know explicitly why you need to “wash behind your ears”, etc., but there is probably a good reason all those mothers have been saying it for generations, even if the reason has been forgotten.

        Marriage, so far as I know, was a Greek scheme to give every fellow a shot at regular pussy, and also that he might know  his children were actually his own. Whatever it’s many drawbacks, and I’ve experienced most of them, it seems to have been a great factor in the advance of man.
However it was advertised to attract members, marriage was always been about assigning responsibilities. Benefits came from responsibilities. Homosexuals are skipping the one and gaining the other. Is it harmful? It’s meant to be harmful.

        Never put weirdoes in charge?Have you noticed the absolute manic desperation that SOME folks will go to for an election to fulfill an “onus” of “public office”?For that matter, have you ever noticed which “tent” the weirdest ones end up poking their nose into, and finding open arms?

        We all approach this subject from different perspectives, of course. But my take on marriage is it is a union of opposites; and heterosexual marriage is such a union. Men are, in many ways, not at like women.I am sure greater minds than mine can dismiss my opposites notion easily, and such a dismissal may well have been done plenty of times in the past. However this is how I see it. Therefore, right or wrong, I see same-sex marriage as, er, not of opposites.Sure one of them may pretend to be the female (or the male, of course) but they aren’t really. Therefore to me it doesn’t work as intended.I also think that if they can freely cohabit, if they can form civil partnerships that have legal bindings to ensure the proper distribution of assists/wealth when the time comes, then the gays have everything they want. Why insist it has a different name?Perhaps Z you are right: it is all quite harmless in the great scheme of things. Or perhaps it is damaging because the intent of some is not to merely be happy — a laudable aim for us all — but to make blazing, rousing show of something that doesn’t need to be put on Broadway.Oh well, each to their own.

            I tend to assume that all human societies have a fair amount of magical thinking sloshing about. In general, we like our reality watered down as much as possible. The question is about limits. Calling two guys sharing rent and a bed married strains credulity. No one really thinks of them as married. They don’t even think they are married, if you read the literature. Pretending is, I suspect, a modern way of being polite.
But, there may be downstream consequences we have not considered. There is a reason, after all, why it has never been done.

        “People who join movements do so from self-loathing.”
This is an under appreciated truth and a key insight to how the world works.

        I’m against homosexual marriage, only for the reason that it keeps the moonbats busy with that particular cause. Homo marriage doesn’t really bother me but if it were to be legalised, they wouldn’t just go away and be happy. Oh no, there will be something new on the agenda and no doubt it will be much worse.
