        Whenever Derb replays selections from his archive, I take an unexpected trip down memory lane. When he plays an old recording, I can’t help but remember what I was doing and believed at the time.
For about half of the time that Derb has been doing podcasts, he was more radical than me. He was more conscious of race and more skeptical of immigration and military adventures.
Although I guess that he would not like the racialism that I arrived at, I want to gratefully acknowledge his thoughtful commentary over all these years and how much I learned about history and literature.
