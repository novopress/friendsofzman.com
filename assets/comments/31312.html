        Well, it‚Äôs Friday and there‚Äôs no new post, so it‚Äôs safe to assume Z slipped and fell off the roof. Sad, that his last post was a review of neurotic nebbish Woody Allen‚Äôs film. It reminds me of what Charles Bukowski once said about his own potential demise by slipping and cracking his head on the apron of his swimming pool. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not even an ignoble ending. That‚Äôs just entirely being sh*t on by the gods.‚Äù

        Am I the only one to think Keaton is a blot everywhere she is found?
No charm, no appeal, no subtlety, no looks.
What did Allen but especially Coppola see in her?

            Well, since Coppola never intended forThe Godfatherto be anything more than an Italexploitation whinge, maybe making the white woman as bland and uppity as possible was part of the desired aesthetic.

            I think that was a piss take to keep you guessing since he often doesn‚Äôt post before a holiday weekend.
If he doesn‚Äôt reappear by next week then we should probably put out an APB at that point.

                    Dude, I like Blue Velvet a lot. Lynch is probably my favorite director, even though I cannot stand 1/2 of his output. But when he does nail it, he produces unparalled Romanticism.

        Woodburning spergout incoming:The powerdrill driven ‚ÄòSooteater‚Äô devices are the tits.Woodsplitting in crisp late fall/winter air is excellent exercise and oddly mind settling but the wood  won‚Äôt be good til Spring shoulder season, at the earliest.If using a masonry chimney, an insulated metal chimney liner will draft better and maybe save your house in the case of a chimney fire.  Almost nobody installs them that way.The new hybrid stoves combine catalysts and re-burn chambers to make the most of your fuel.   Very efficient .  Much less acrid smoke.  Not that WV gets all that cold.

        A little sidelight: in the 90‚Äôs the Allman Brothers Band and side project Gov‚Äôt Mule had a bassist named Allen Woody. For years I assumed that was a stage name, a joke played by a Southern boy to parody the name of a famous New York Jew. In fact, it was his real name, full name Douglas Allen Woody. Unfortunately this Woody OD‚Äôd in 2000.

        One observation by Z-man in this column stood out to me as probably anachronistic; namely that ‚ÄúAnnie Hall feels like a professionally made film school project‚Ä¶‚ÄùCloser to the truth, I suspect, is that film school projects are the way they are‚Äîindulgent, solipsistic, meaningless‚Äîbecause Woody Allen set the tone first. In other words, the thematic ‚Äúnothingness‚Äù of today‚Äôs culture (in film and the arts generally) is an index of the *triumph* of the Woody Allen perspective over what had existed in America before.That even goes for today‚Äôs politics. What was the whole Covid fiasco if not a total capitulation to the nervous, paranoid attitudes embodied in Allen‚Äôs characters? Back in 2020, if they had replaced Drs. Fauci and Birx with Alvie Singer and Annie Hall, would there have been any difference in policy?

            The ruling Chinese Communist Party has had a practice of imposing quarantines of varying degrees whenever a new communicable disease emerged there. It‚Äôs part of a governing ideology that imagines it can solve any social problem that may attract their attention. COVID was unusual only insofar as Western countries (and eventually most of the world) decided they should emulate communist Chinese practices for some reason.

                I tend to agree.  Many dissidents assumed that the cov1d policies were primarily about advancing permanent totalitarian control.  But as damaging and threatening as those policies were, they were not permanent.
I‚Äôm sure that there is some truth there.  Elites like Bill Gates had written about how to exploit the next pandemic and Big Pharma always wants to secure permanent extraction schemes.
But my guess is that the most consequential factor was the hypochondria of our elites, chosen and female.

        Does anyone here get the deep irony of this blog post? The Zman goes to the store, buys some stuff, goes home, takes care of the cats, cooks some food, and repairs the house. Then the next day he blogs about it‚Äì what happened in the drive thru lane, what happened when he cancelled his online order, why the hardware store is better, which fast food is better, and so on.Do you get it yet? The Zman is Alvy Singer. The Zman is Leopold Bloom. Or maybe The Zman is the grown-up version of Stephen Dedalus ‚Äì the anti-hero, the white catholic educated man who is too smart to believe in religious fantasies but who still longs for a moral authority in society.Nothing happens in the movie. Nothing happens in the novel. And nothing happens in a blog.

                I may have blended some of The Zman‚Äôs Gab posts into my description of his daily routine, but the idea still holds. Blogging is generally a mind dump of someone‚Äôs inner monologue. James Joyce‚Äôs Ulysses is the archetype of this form. I just find it ironic when bloggers level the criticism that nothing happens in Ulysses when everything they do was invented by Joyce.Annie Hall is a 1970s‚Äô version of the Joycean inner monologue without the depth. Allen is primarily a comedian, and the movie should only be seen as a series of comedy sketches on film. Some of the sketches are funny, and some aren‚Äôt.

                    What isn‚Äôt a mind dump? Columns, novels, poems, songs, symphonies, paintings, blogs‚Äìall, in a very real sense, are mind dumps. Not much of a criticism of Z, then.

        Well, I‚Äôll have to dissent from Z-man here. I‚Äôm a huge Woody Allen fan, and I love Annie Hall. But I‚Äôm an art school weirdo, so‚Ä¶And no, I‚Äôm not Jewish or anything close to it. That‚Äôs the funny part. I‚Äôm an old-stock American whose ancestors fought in the Revolution. Woody Allen and his ilk probably think my people are trash. So why do I like his movies?I don‚Äôt know. Maybe for the same reason I liked reading articles about weird foreign tribes in National Geographic, back when it was still a good magazine. I find Jewish narcissism fascinating because it‚Äôs so exotic, compared to what I‚Äôm used to.

            I know what you mean, Mr. Blank. I‚Äôve gotten a lot of genuine laughs out of Allen‚Äôs films over the years (though not so much since his turn to open perversity in the early 1990s).My youthful experience, as a Christian going to his movies with Jewish friends, was that we could all enjoy the given movie in the moment. But the difference in perspective showed itself when we left the theater. My friends would be going on about how Woody was so wise and ‚Äúknows so much about relationships.‚Äù To me, on the other hand, his characters were a textbook of what NOT to do; a negative example, not a positive one to emulate. That‚Äôs what I found so funny about them.Forty years on, life experiences among us have borne out the ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù of using Allen as a positive or negative role model. I still laugh at films like Sleeper, Love and Death, and Broadway Danny Rose. But it‚Äôs tinged with bitterness over the self-destructive path on which he led some of my dear friends.

            Ha. Good point. And I think my fascination mirrors your own.
Tangentially, have you ever noticed that Jewish filmmakers, when portraying white families, very frequently project Jewish familial dysfunctionality on them? White families are almost always portrayed as squabbling, obnoxious and shrewish. The classic example is the Neary family in Spielberg‚Äôs ‚ÄúClose Encounters.‚Äù Great film, BTW.

                Yes Ostei, a solid insight. The other tactic is to portray gentile family life as emotionless, repressed, hypocritical, inhuman‚Äîwith passions of hostility, sexuality, and violence simmering just below the placid surface. This was, IIRC, the case with Annie‚Äôs family in the film under examination. (It results in some memorable bits, though, like Woody being perceived as a Hasidic Jew by Annie‚Äôs grandma, or Christopher Walken as the brother driving a nervous Woody to the airport after confessing his death wish of ramming his car into oncoming traffic.)Allen does this in most of his other films too. But never, even in his ‚Äúserious‚Äù films, shows Christian family life as wholesome, mutually supportive, sincerely loving, and capable of sustaining virtue and decency across generations.As I wrote elsewhere on this thread, this dark portrayal really has become the default setting of the way the ‚Äúintellectual‚Äù and ‚Äúartistic‚Äù class regard family life in this country. Another ‚Äútriumph‚Äù of the Woody Allen perspective over the older American culture.

                    Indeed.
And how ‚Äôbout Norman Lear‚Äôs Bunker family in All in the Family? A funny sitcom, but it‚Äôs also nothing more than 25-minute episodic shouting matches. Who could stand to live like that? Jews, I guess. And yet the family is white. Even Meathead Rob Reiner is a Polack rather than a Jew, IIRC.

                Well, people who are ‚Äúlike that‚Äù don‚Äôt really believe that normal people can exist.  So when they see a happy family they assume it‚Äôs some kind of American Beauty charade, and there must be all this seething hostility beneath the surface.

        I am Jewish but am rarely around other Jews so perhaps my impression is wrong. It seems there are less Woody Allen type Jewish men today than there were in the 70s, both in and out of Hollywood. Have Jewish men toughened up and become more like gentile men? If so this saddens me. When I saw (Jewish) Maroon 5 singer Adam Levine at a Superbowl half time show with his muscular, tattooed body it horrified me. Jewish men never used to look hypermasculine before. Hopefully he is an outlier.

            Like Woody or not, he‚Äôs an important figure in late 20th century American culture and still on the scene, so he‚Äôs very much worth discussing.

            I am not surprised this triggered many readers over here, don‚Äôt know about the Substack adult theater thing because I don‚Äôt pay for it‚Ä¶ Allen has made so many random movies, that I can always remember a few terrible ones (‚ÄúDeconstructing Harry‚Äù‚Äîso bad I wondered how he kept not only working after this, but still drawing big names) and a few eccentric enjoyable ones (‚ÄúSweet and Lowdown‚Äù‚Äîthis switching from being an NYC Judaism nerd to olde timey jazz nerd). But I haven‚Äôt seen all his major-opus movies, such as this one, and at 44 I doubt I will get around to it. When I was younger I thought I liked the earlier slapstick entries like ‚ÄúBananas‚Äù and ‚ÄúSleeper‚Äù but now I find them awkward and strange (because he somehow became Serious Filmmaker between then and some time in the 80s‚Äî this does not compute). There is such lack of compelling unity to his oeuvre, nothing to latch onto, that you can be assures normies only associate him with personal family gossip away from the camera, which admittedly was quite weird by late 20th Century standards.

        For me the worst of Woody Allen‚Äôs films, and that in itself is saying something, is one called ‚ÄúThe Front‚Äù.  When I was 20 or 21 I would occasionally hang out with an avant garde crowd of hippy wannabies who would leave the safety of Delaware Co. Pa. and cruise into center city Philly for one of the bullshit offerings of Allen (and someone calling himself Fellini who just plain sucked) of the middle nineteen seventies.Even at the inexperienced age of 21 I remember coming out of the theater after viewing ‚ÄúThe Front‚Äù and feeling the need for a stiff drink.  To my disgust, the hippies were rhapsodizing over this film and, while normally tolerant of their lunatic ideas, I exploded. ‚ÄúWhy on earth does anyone care?  Oh dear, a commie got blacklisted. He should have been expelled.  I‚Äôm GLAD he went to prison, I hope the sequel shows his rotting skeleton there!‚ÄùAnd so on.  I stopped hanging around them at that time.  Fellini was another lost cause they gushed over. As Zman might say, ‚Äúmy goodness, these people.‚Äù

            I don‚Äôt even think this is a particular thing to any given generation.  As a Xennial I went to plenty of these sorts of films with pretentious liberal friends back in the 2000s.  You had brokebutt mountain and that one film with Clooney and Dr. Bashir from Star Trek that was something about middle eastern politics.  Shitlibs just go to those movies to look fashionable.

            I‚Äôve never seen that particular abomination but there are tons of these kinds of movies. It‚Äôs a whole genre to itself in fact. The basic plot is ‚Äúwretched commie shitbag FINALLY gets arrested by the Gestapo, Franco‚Äôs men, Pinochet‚Äôs men, the Iranian religious police, or whatever local group is trying to keep their country from becoming part of the Glorious Purple Dildo Soviet Republics.‚Äù Thankfully, the arrest is usually in the first 5 minutes. Mournfully, the next 3 ‚Äì 5 hours of the movie is all faggy-noir camera angles of our Hero Shitbagsky starting at the shadows on his cell wall. Just to keep the audience awake they occasionally have an interlude to show just how not-nice the jailers are. In a final act of mercy for the audience they eventually march Shitbagsky out to the prison yard and shoot him ‚Äì Fin!The recent movie Oppenheimer is a modern take on this theme. True devotees of the genre will find that at 3 hours it‚Äôs way too short. They do a marvelous job of faggy-noir though with this weird spinning abstract atom thingie that makes a buzzing sound. Hint: that‚Äôs the highlight of the movie.

            Ulysses might be the second or third most lied about book of all time, but Joyce himself never pretended it was anything that it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs unpretentious to a fault. Its refusal to explain itself‚Äîthere aren‚Äôt even chapter titles!‚Äîis *textual* (if not authorial) humility. He left it too easy for academics, critics, and other non-readers to misrepresent.Allen‚Äôs films are often nothing like he claims them‚Äîor like sometimes they claim themselves, out loud in the middle of the damn movie‚Äîto be, because by inclination he‚Äôs a film critic/scholar/mocker, not a filmmaker.I love a few of his movies, but they‚Äôre all bullshit.

        CRIMES &amp; MISDEMEANORS (1989) is Allen‚Äôs masterpiece.  A great film, one of the best ever.
‚ÄúHannah and Her Sisters‚Äù and ‚ÄúRadio Days‚Äù are also quite excellent.
The man‚Äôs politics are of course what they are.  But I‚Äôd be dishonest if I said he weren‚Äôt intelligent or wasn‚Äôt an artist (at least for a few flicks).

        ‚ÄúAnne Hall‚Ä¶..‚ÄùDid someone reference the 70‚Äòs version of Seinfeld?  A comedy about nothing?  Well, not nothing‚Äîjust a show following the antics of a group of self-absorbed characters going about their selfish lives in the Big Apple.  Oddly enough this show was also developed by a couple of Jews.I liked Anne Hall at the time, but times change as one grows up and understands how nihilistic the entire ‚Äúplot‚Äù is.  My youthful angst has been replaced by experiential understanding, aka ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù.  To support this point, I‚Äôd point out that Allen attempted to repeat his Anne Hall success a couple of decades later with limited success.  His die hard fans welcomed the movie, but its success was limited as society had moved on from the 70‚Äôs.  Boomers grew up?On the other hand, Seinfeld seems to have found a niche.  Perhaps it was the lack of neuroticism on the part of the main Seinfeld characters wrt their behavior.  Selfishness has been normalized as an accepted value, while Christianity has been removed from center stage in our society.  Allen and (((company))) have been wildly successful.

            Seinfeld worked because the characters routinely screwed themselves over for their own selfishness, so the show actually did have a moral to it despite the complaints at the time from people used to those dull 80s sitcoms where Billy cheats on his algebra test and his dad gives him a stern talking to.

        Congratulations on getting ready for your woodstove install, Zman.  There is nothing like the warmth it puts out.  Same for the feeling of security a well-filled woodshed inspires.  I would be miserable without the a/c our mini-splits provide in the humid summers here, but I could survive without them.  Whereas I know no matter the storm or interruption in electricity or lack of propane for the Generac (Heaven forfend), I need not worry about freezing.

                cg2:  Yes, thanks, I do know to do that (excellent neighbors plus watching YT).  And we are currently using our efficient mini splits for heat because it‚Äôs just not cold enough for the wood stove.  But we did use it one night about 3-4 weeks ago and house/cabin was quickly up to an uncomfortable 72 degrees (I keep it in the 65-68 range and we don‚Äôt expect to walk around in t-shirts in the winter).

                    Have you priced a roof there, 3g?  I had an asphalt tile roof put on my upstate NY residence about 10 years ago and it was more than $10K.  In 2019 I had a metal roof put on a rental property and it was $9K.  Both jobs were done by Amish crews.  2019 was around the first time that a metal roof was no more expensive than tile, which is why I went with it.  I have no idea what the breakdown is today, though.

                        KGB:  Not yet, no.  I fully expect it to be costly.  We thought everything was in pretty good condition per the inspection we had done, and the previous owners of one year provided receipts proving they had the wood stove flue cleaned, the septic tank pumped, painted the exterior, and sold us the almost new Speed Queen washer and dryer they had installed.But we had to immediately replace the main mini-split (unexpected), the water heater (expected) the toilet (unexpected) and the kitchen sink plumbing (partially expected).  So since the roof is not leaking, it‚Äôs going to have to wait.  Just hope we can afford (and actually get material) when the need and opportunity arises. There are a lot of Mennonites in this area and Amish within a 100 mile radius.  I don‚Äôt know who people use here (when they don‚Äôt do things themselves).Lots of wants but no immediate ‚Äòneeds.‚Äô  We have a solid roof, a wood stove, a well, a propane gas cook stove, a Generac, and a 1000 gallon propane tank.  Not to mention fiber optic phone/internet way out here in the woods.  Plus all the deer and wild turkeys and a killer view at the end of a dead-end road.  We are blessed.

                        The Amish around me all put in crazy roof bids (save one, whose work I wouldn‚Äôt trust on a bet).  For the Englisher who put our roof on I think the metal came at a 20% premium of asphalt.  The main motivator though was that our place stands alone on a wind tunnel and we knew shingles would inevitably be stripped at some point.

                        When you say they put in ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù bids, do you mean they are below market rates?  Here they tend to charge average rates, but I generally like their work and they knock out their jobs quickly.  An Englisher or Hispanic is prone to leaving a half-finished job for a period of time as they work on other projects.  The Amish finish what they start.

        I must say I‚Äôve never seen anything by Mr. Allen. Then again Z, from your analysis I trust I‚Äôm not missing much. There have been so many films and series that could have been more, but in the end are just vehicles for banality.Some of the most engrossing films/series I‚Äôve ever watched include: Das Boot, The Sopranos, Band of Brothers, The Deer Hunter, Dad‚Äôs Army, and Downfall. They all give themselves full licence to develop certain characters, and have a reality about them that makes them interesting. They are a comment of the time in which they were made, but also the time in which they are set.For example, The Sopranos, whose original run was ‚Äì I believe ‚Äì from 1999 to 2007, captures a point in time where mobile phones existed and were commonplace, but smartphones did not! Think of what a tiny slice of time that really was, and I believe it significant, because the smartphones have upended things in so many ways. Changed things perhaps more drastically than even mobile phones did upon their initial arrival. It sounds daft, but it is the sort of thing I found fascinating about the series. It was also beautifully shot and very poignant at times. As a plus, it actually made an attempt to deal with the obvious racial rift between Italians and blacks in a smart and realistic way.As for Das Boot (1984), it managed to make four and a half hours of blokes in a metal tube incredibly fascinating. I could go on about it at length, but won‚Äôt; except to say that if nobody here has seen it, please do so ‚Äì but I suspect I‚Äôm preaching to the choir.Personally, Mr. Allen‚Äôs appearance always annoyed me; so it was/is doubtful I shall make the effort with his film output.

Oddly, those ‚Äúover there‚Äù in my family seem to care little about reminiscing over events in that conflict.  Celebrating the conflict in the movies and writings seems an American thing‚Äìif not Western in general.
I believe their war experience taught them the *wrong* lesson.

                    Iron Coffins: A Personal Account Of The German U-boat Battles Of World War IIby Herbert A. Werner, which was used as a source for some of the movieDas Boat.
Operation Drumbeat: Germany‚Äôs U-Boat Attacks Along the American Coast in World War IIby Michael Gannon. It tells the story of U-Boat ops off the East Coast from right after Germany declared war on the US until late 1942. The featured U-Boat, U-123 actually did have a reporter on the submarine for one of their missions, like the U-Boat inDas Boat.

The novel was written by a German submariner with firsthand experience. I believe Das Boot was written by a rider, a journalist who only spent a limited time on a U boat.

                Many years ago I used to scuba dive on the wrecks of a couple U-boats off North Carolina, namely the U-352 and U-85. What struck me was how small they were and what it must have been like to cross the Atlantic in one.

                    Back in the 60‚Äôs, the fleet would every so often dock in NYC.  They then had an open house and we once went downtown and got to tour the boats.  Those days the fleet *still* had the diesel driven American sub‚Äôs.  I got to go through one. Amazing experience even for a young boy.  Forward were the torpedoes and each one had crew bunks along the side.  Just like the movies. I remember being amazed at ‚Äúhot bunking‚Äù.  üòâThe instrument panels were the most complex I‚Äôve ever seen.  Imagine a round pillar in the middle of the path with a couple of hundred gauges around it.  What all was there to watch?

        My own viewing of old movies continues, most recently The Mission (1986). Directed by Roland Joffe, who also gave us The Killing Fields and the Demi Moore version of The Scarlet Letter. So perhaps I should have known it would be disappointing relative to the billing. Of course any movie produced in the 1980s about colonials and natives‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Other than the parts filmed at the Iguazu Falls there was little point in filming on location in South America, as the rest of it could have been done on a Hollywood backlot.But I did manage to learn a little history, Treaty of Madrid, Jesuit suppression, not really from the movie itself, but by following some links on its wikipedia page.

        Although my interest in Woody Allen in young adulthood was almost entirely detrimental, which I spent the next decade unlearning, I still say that:‚ÄúHigh Crimes and Misdemeanors‚Äù is profound in its juxtaposition of the psychology of the wicked and the ethical.  The tragedy that the wicked so often prosper.‚ÄúShadows and Fog‚Äù has stunning visuals that recall the classic early gothic horror films and has an entertaining Kafkaesque plot.  As with most of his films, it hyperventilates with fear of the goyim.‚ÄúA Midsummer Night‚Äôs Sex Comedy‚Äù is a fun exploration of the conflict between materialism and mysticism.  The funniest scene is when sexual jealousy reduces the man of reason to his primitive ancestor.

            High Crimes and Misdemeanorsis (or was) my favorite Allen film.
His best work when was he was aping Ingmar Bergman while keeping his films grounded in that fart-sniffing NYC world of white people. LikeHannah and Her Sisters.

There‚Ä¶ Fixed it for you.
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a NYC thing or a wealthy thing though. I know a lot of Jews. None of them, even ones I don‚Äôt like behave like the stereotypical Jew as reflected in films like this.
Isaac Hakkabut (Off on a Comet, Jules Verne) is a better and more accurate negative representation.
Given the popularity of Allen among Jews, they must see something they like and think it is accurate.

                    Allen wasn‚Äôt just representing (((white))) people. There were always main characters, especially women, who were Gentiles. My take on hisoeuvreis he was trying to capture the fart-sniffing world of midwit Manhattan, where Jews and whites comingled regularly.
Allen himself was popular with Jews and fart-sniffing whites because he was the everyman fantasy for the midwit demographic. Here was a character who, despite his looks and neuroses, could charm women and be successful.

        Funny you should mention it.  Just a few weeks ago I completed the digital transcription of all the VHS tapes I had in a box sitting in the garage for over twenty years.  Annie Hall was on one of them, and I watched it the other night for the first time in at least that long.  You‚Äôre right about good portrayal of mid-70s New York.  The film holds up pretty well.  Don‚Äôt forget it won the Best Picture Oscar that year as well.

        After reading today‚Äôs post, I found myself asking ‚Äúwhat did I learn from this review of a nominally useless film?‚ÄùThe easy quick answer is . . . stay away, its a waste of time. But upon reflection, the popularity of the film (and its acclaim on the Top 100 list) reveals a much more important lesson about our society. Surviving art from the ancient Greeks (statuary, architecture, pottery etc) is a window into the aesthetic of that age and its people. It says that they valued greatness and accomplishment and aspiration for perfection of the human soul and mind. It was uplifting and hopeful. In contrast, Annie Hall is a debasement of human evolution and glorifies the worst aspects of the worse exemplars of our species. It aspires to drag us down and be entertained by dysfunction, as if that was a noble goal of the gift of life.How far we have fallen. I choose otherwise. I will not settle for degradation and decline as virtues to be admired nor pursued. And you should not either.

            I agree with your general point, but I think you are being a bit hard on old Woody. Sure, he indulged his neuroses on the silver screen, but he also took the mickey out of it all too.

                Is there any indication that the ancient Greeks glorified their ‚Äúbad‚Äù art by putting on a top 100 list? My point is not that bad art is absent from other cultures, but that glorifying it is most definitely a symptom of a sick society.

                    Nobody ever had the consumer culture that AINO does. Making lists is very much an American phenomenon, Americans love lists, and the ‚Äúbest of‚Äù lists are just a way for ‚Äúexperts‚Äù on ‚Äúculture‚Äù to define what is best to consume, which is a form of status signaling, since in consumer culture you will be judged by what you consume more than by what you produce.

        In 1977, the hard-charging don‚Äôt need no man feminist was still very much a work in Progress.  Women were not in leadership everywhere, as they are now.  Girlbosses and lone wandering females were relatively rare.I remember Annie Hall.  It was an influential film and certainly had a purpose, which apparently was to further draw attention to the ‚Äòexciting‚Äô life of the pre-Sex In The City single empowered female.I mean, NYC is as noxiously feminine a city as that manjaw-faced female idol in the Harbor.  Musta been Gretch (the Wretch) Whitmer‚Äôs great-great granny.The movie isn‚Äôt titled ‚ÄòAlvy Singer‚Äô, after all.

                Brooks and Allen have dialogs to interpret on two levels.One is for the bulk of the audience.The other is for the knowing insiders who smirk at the rubes, idiots and cattle or sheep.When you see that you grow to despise both of them.

        Woody Allen‚Äôs only redeeming factor is his eye for the camera. If you watch AH in mute (really, the only acceptable way) you can really see it; every single frame of that film could stand by itself as great documentary photography.
Spike Lee has the same talent. Both make exceptionally beautiful films, but that‚Äôs all. It‚Äôs sad, as they could have had great careers as cinematographers, but they are each thoroughly obnoxious representatives of their races, so of course they must write and direct!

Jungle Fever is an exceptionally beautiful film? Spike Lee is another Black man making a (anti-White) statement in all his films.  To watch his body of work is to poison your mind.  That he has cinematic training and some talent in application thereof only makes him more dangerous to Whites.  Sigh‚Ä¶.

        If I‚Äôm right that modernity is the loss of religion, then Jews simply had a 1500-year head start on the rest of us. Hence their over representation: they‚Äôve had more practice‚Äî they‚Äôre better at it. Some JQ guys think we‚Äôre living in the world they created, but it could simply be that we‚Äôre catching up, becoming more like them. Fwiw.

            ‚Äúthe essential reality of the Jewish condition, at least as Jews see it, which is that they are always a people who dwell alone, regardless of where they find themselves.‚Äù
‚ÄúThese are two people who are alienated from themselves, so it is why they cannot have a normal human relationship.‚Äù
If postmodernity is the loss of identity following from the loss of religion. Again, fwiw. It‚Äôs not that Jews haven‚Äôt tried to integrate from time to time. Perhaps they can‚Äôt, and so they slam hard back into their Jewishness, which turns out to be alienation.

        Annie Hall, hmmm? Sounds stultifyingly boring from Z‚Äôs synopsis. I did not appreciateBananasorSleeper, and I‚Äôve always thought of Allen as the penultimate self-absorbed twat. A whiny, meek schmuck with an irresistibly punchable face. I am quite certain that I would loathe the fellow in person.Just to polish my anti-semitic bona fides a little, I find jews in toto to be uniquely uninteresting people, so wholly wrapped up in themselves and their self-imposed ‚Äústruggle‚Äù (You think it‚Äôs easy being annoying enough to get thrown out of 109 countries?) that they scarcely have time to notice the greater world about them. Glib, quick with an insult for everyone else, but the thinnest of skins when criticism is leveled at themselves.There is a running joke around chateau MG in September that goes like this:Beloved bride: The kids are off from school tomorrow for Rosh Hashanah.Moi: Rosh Hashanah‚Ä¶Rosh Hashanah‚Ä¶Isn‚Äôt that the jewish holiday where they sit around pitying themselves and whining about how persecuted they are? Oh, wait, that‚Äôseveryjewish holiday.

                Race realists always struggle with broad demographic truth and the personal truth that comes from interaction with individual members of the demographic in question. It‚Äôs the NAXALT phenomenon. With Jews, it is quite clear that, as a people, they are hostile toward the white race and use their considerable money, power and influence to harm us, even to the point of undermining our civilization. On the other hand, my personal dealings with Jews have been almost uniformly positive. Jews were instrumental, for instance, in getting me and my wife jobs on a couple of different occasions, and my current best friend is a renowned Jewish academic who is a borderline DR.Having said this, and as painful as it may be, we have to set aside the personal and accept the big picture. And that picture tells us that whites are better off without Jews in our midst.

                    Your observation is not restricted to Jews.  I happens with other races as well.  Indeed, I think the phenomena of IKAGO is the greatest impediment we have to solidarity within the White race as compared to others.

                    I draw the opposite lesson, Ostei. I know all about the malign influence of scum like Soros. However, the Jews I know are nearly all conservative (I‚Äôm in Europe) and feel the same way about the way the world is going. Meanwhile, most of the Whites around me all bent over backwards to get themselves vaxxed and go all Nazi with people like me who weren‚Äôt. I‚Äôll put the individual before the ideology if that‚Äôs okay with you.

                        In that case, Euro Jews are ideologically the opposite of American Jews, which strikes me as highly unlikely. On this side of the pond, they vote Leftist about 75 percent of the time, and this is when voting Republican doesn‚Äôt even signal one is on the Right.

Sure, I try to do so as well.  However, societal decisions are made on the typical‚Äîor group‚Äîaverage.  We build cars for average height people. Four foot 3‚Äù or six foot 4‚Äù people are in a bind for leg room and head clearance.  And so we decide whom to avoid or watch out for as sometimes the stakes are just too high if we are wrong.

                    As a kid growing up in the 70s, I loved that decade. Yes, I know the economy from 1973 through 1979 was terrible, and that the clothing and cars were hideous. What‚Äôs more, it was the first full decade in which America was in steep decline. But I would go back to the 70s in a New York minute, if I could. Compared to today, it was Xanadu.

                        As far as growing up in a decade, I‚Äôd rate the 70s just behind the 50s and the 60s, and well ahead of the 80s, 90s, and whatever the featureless decades after 2000 are called.
My rating:
1 ‚Äì the 1950s2 ‚Äì the 1960s3 ‚Äì the 1970s4-  the 1980s5 ‚Äì the 1990s6-8 the 2000s, 2010s, and the current decade.
Do you notice that after the 1980s, or at the latest the 1990s, decades cease to have ‚Äúpersonalities‚Äù. 2000 on is just a gray goo, from my perspective.

        The whole damn film reeks of Northeastern urban, neurotic smugness. If you lived in Manhattan in the seventies (I did), you remember the creeping sordidness, the changing cityscape that was becoming increasingly ugly (the newly built Javits center). It‚Äôs all so painful to recall. And these peoples‚Äô self-absorption seems to exemplify the post WWII triumphalism that masked the newly emerging silent panic that was engulfing the goyim. They didn‚Äôt want to think about what was happening. They just quietly tramped on down those increasingly ugly streets and dirty sidewalks to meet that friend over a drink at the latest trendy bar/restaurant where they could bitch about the broken subway system or praise the latest art exhibit at the Met. How did that work out, Woody?

            Epaminondas:  I have visited New York twice in my life.  Once during college to see ‚ÄúSame Time Next Year‚Äù on Broadway (I think in 1977) and once to visit a friend for a few days in 1983.  I found the place filthy, crowded, depressing, and frightening.  No desire to ever visit again, and no movie or commercial attempting to dress up the dross as gold will ever change my mind.

            A movie that really made New York look bad was the 1974 Death Wish with Charles Bronson.  The city scenes exuded a sense of menace.
In fairness, New York City improved dramatically under Guilani and Bloomberg, before declining again under Deblasio.

        Allen is nothing save superficial and fake. The anxious and neurotic pseudo-intellectual with absolutely nothing to say. If he‚Äôs considered part of the ‚Äúcultural elite‚Äù I shudder for the soul of the USA. Watched ‚ÄúAnnie Hall‚Äù and ‚ÄúInteriors‚Äù in the late ‚Äô70s. Utter tripe masquerading as cultural products. Problem for the USA is that unlike France and Germany it has never had a high culture. If it did it would have a yardstick to measure how utterly wanting this Woody Allen crud is.

        After Woody got tired of his alienated Jewish nebbish shtick, his devoir to Ingmar Bergman, Anna And Her Sisters (based on Cries And Whispers,) was pretty decent, and Midnight In Paris is worth seeing and reviewing.
The change happened when Woody jilted Mia Farrow for their stepdaughter, and the progressive media made him persona non grata for allegedly being a pedophile. The two of them, stepdad and stepdaughter, are still together. Quietly out of sight of the media.

            My, how times change. Allen‚Äôs pedophilia and perversion would be celebrated today and have boosted his career. It would be doubly so if the Korean trophy child announced a transition so she could top her stepfather.

        As someone who lived in Manhattan in the bad old Ed Koch years, I found myself deeply immersed in the nebbish culture you describe.  Every day at work I would watch as a schlimazel dropped his soup into the lab of some poor schlemiel, and cluck my tongue, calling to mind what John Murray Cuddihy had written in ‚ÄòThe Ordeal of Civility:‚Äô  ‚Äúthe ordeal is the unconsummated social courtship of Gentile and Jew.‚Äù  Framed through bizarro pedo ‚ÄúWoody Allen‚Äôs‚Äù (Allan Konigsberg) neurotic lens, you get the vapid ‚ÄòAnnie Hall,‚Äô and it‚Äôs innumerable imitations that continue to echo through the ghost alleys of our crumbling civilization.Pink Floyd did it better.  ‚ÄúJust two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl, year after yearRunning over the same old ground, what have we found?‚Äù

        I didn‚Äôt know much about Dianne Keaton, so I looked her up and got an article with excerpts of her memoir. It really goes to show how unpleasant and crazy you seem if you let your insecurities become your personality. I don‚Äôt get why these people are held in such high esteem and it‚Äôs depressing that they‚Äôre held up as examples to women.

                My go-to theory to ‚Äúwhatever happened to Actress X‚Äù in the 90‚Äôs, 00‚Äôs, and 10‚Äôs that the up and comers who left the screen right before they went major starlet is that they wouldn‚Äôt pay the Weinstein Casting Couch toll.
(Ashely Judd comes to mind)
The corollary of this is that women who DID make it big in these years were, well, open to going the ‚Äúextra mile‚Äù, with Big W or some other(s).
Hollywood is gross, and the Zman is right that actors should be considered carny trash.

        Annie is a neurotic dingbat who every man over thirty has met a thousand times.Over thirty Z? I was meeting them in mytwenties.Then again, they don‚Äôt fully ripen until their thirties, do they? üòèWoody Allen‚Äôs hang-ups and insecurities are interesting to no one but Woody Allen.I apologize for not subscribing to your reviews, but if you haven‚Äôt reviewed it already, take a gander atStardust Memories. It was at the point where Woody decided he had to be a ‚ÄúSerious Director‚Äù and move away from comedy, but I‚Äôve heard tell the movie comes across as an extended middle finger to fans who preferred his (in his words in the script) ‚Äúearlier, funnier movies‚Äù (Take The Money and Run, Bananas, Sleeper, etc.).Of course, like everything else it‚Äôs been ‚Äúreassessed‚Äù but it‚Äôs interesting at the time Woody strenuously denied it wasn‚Äôt autobiographical. Me thinks the nebbish protests too much.I takeAnnie HallandManhattanas his first steps away from being a solely comedic writer/director and more towards the ‚ÄúSerious Director‚Äù.Stardust Memoriesis the psychic break.Be careful up on the roof Z. We don‚Äôt need you crashing through to the floor and ending up in a body cast.

            You‚Äôre totally correct aboutStardust Memories.  I was actually a fan of Allen‚Äôs earlier, funny movies.  I enjoyed his stand-up too.  I actually enjoyedAnnie Halla lot too.  Since it‚Äôs actually funny, I‚Äôd argue that it too is one of his earlier, funny movies.I think it all went south withManhattan.  Given subsequent events, it‚Äôs particularly creepy with his relationship with a teen-aged girl.  Even setting that aside, it‚Äôs not the least bit funny.  All the aspects ofAnnie Hallthat the Z-man criticizes are ten thousand times more galling inManhattan.  While I watched a few of his post-Manhattanmovies, I don‚Äôt think any of them are worthwhile.

            There was no verbal requirement in my day. Just a strong back and a weak mind.

                Well I have one them. Nowadays you have to read a new service manual every other day. I had a helper once told me ‚ÄúOh I don‚Äôt like to read.‚Äù He‚Äôs doing something else now.
By the way wasn‚Äôt it awesome being up on the roof?

            I‚Äôm guessing that he‚Äôs joking about the roof.  As an acquittance once told me: get someone who knows that they‚Äôre doing, don‚Äôt put the well being of your family at risk by getting on that ladder.

                My Dad decided to put a wood stove in our three story Victorian house to save money. I have pictures of him standing at a dizzying height on the steep roof cleaning the chimney in the coldest part of February. It‚Äôs a miracle that he didn‚Äôt fall off and break his neck. A lot of wood had to be gathered and stored to last us throughout the winter and that‚Äôs what we kids spent a lot of our summer doing.
If you can hire people to do these kinds of things for you, I‚Äôd recommend it.
