        I see nothing wrong with these predictions.  I will add that each month inflation comes in hot people will expect the Fed to act, and the Fed will rattle the cage rhetorically but never really fire the gun.  Tapering at 15 billion is like giving back a penny for every dollar they‚Äôre printing.  The only thing that will tamp down the inflation would be a deflationary asset bubble collapse, and that will be temporary as the government tries to catch the falling knife with ever more spending.I will go out on a limb and say that D.C. needs a war right now.  A real war, not a Covid one, to ‚Äúbring everyone together.‚Äù  I will further go out on a limb and predict that at least one of our ships is sunk in the Black Sea (the last place we belong) because of a crossing of a Putin red-line.  Russia will be cut from SWIFT but they have a robust balance sheet and as war criminal monster Dick Cheney once said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a gas station with a country,‚Äù so they will weather it, and the world, seeing the further weaponization of the dollar, will take note.  I further predict that all my energy stocks will do well.I further predict that Biden will pass away ‚Äúpeacefully in his sleep‚Äù instead of leaving early.  DOCTOR Jill Biden is exactly where she wants to be right now, and is immovable. They will have to convince the wife to convince old Joe.  So that will be a Plan B.

        How must this name be pronounced to experience its power?
With lively faith, with steadfast, unshaken confidence, with deepest reverence and devotion, for in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth. What wickedness, then, is theirs who habitually pronounce this name carelessly and irreverently, upon every occasion! Such a habit is certainly diabolical; for the damned and the devils constantly abuse God and His holy name.

            Well, sometimes God triesto steer the wicked onto the right path, despite them not wanting to go..  Hence, it likely is not a stumble.

                    I recommend that Brian get ALL the shots and ALL the boosters. Get both shots of Pfizer and Moderna and the J&amp;J one. Then take a trip to a few other countries and get some of those exotic ones they have that you can‚Äôt get here. And you can go to Israel now and get a fourth bonus booster. Finally, make sure to get all your kids, pets, and onlyfans girlfriends vaxxed up brah! I hear some of them will get vaxxed on cam if you pay extra.

        2022 is the year Democrats regret flooding he country with illegals who fled Democrats in their home countries.Inflation is baked into the cake.  There is no avoiding it.  Social unrest is coming as a 20% increase in ribeye can be absorbed, but a 20% increase in staple foods like Mac n Cheese would throw a lot of families into poverty.  There will be a recession, which the Government Party will try to fix with spending accelerating inflation.A upper-middle member or members of the Government Party is assassinated.  Nobody will know who did it, and nobody will claim responsibility.Russian invades Ukraine in force.  A few Russian oligarchs are sanctioned.  The American People will wildly oppose military intervention, but the Government Party will do whatever it wants.A majority of people will start saying the 2020 election was rigged, and that there was no insurrection on 1/6, ‚Äúbut there should have been and I wish it had been successful.‚Äù

        I predict a major domestic terrorist attack on a social media company headquarters in the next 5 years. As it becomes clear that nothing will be done by the government about corporate censorship regardless of who has formal power, and as the problems of cancel culture accelerate, vigilantes will take matters into their own hands.

        Happy New Year everyone. I hope my predictions are dead wrong:1. Rapidly spiraling inflation and shortages, including widespread food shortages as Biden refuses to back down on the vax mandate and workers just walk out leads to wage/price controls and rationing. With a side dish of race based rationing (no limits for blacks, plenty for Whitey) and prices (blacks pay basically nothing, Whitey pays a lot). This is easy ‚Äî TX and NY already limit healthcare to Whites in preference to blacks and Hispanics.2. Because #1, a huge black market (no pun intended) springs up in everything, as blacks take advantage of no limits lower prices to buy up from retailers and sell on the black market, putting the hurt on Wal Mart, Amazon, supermarkets, etc.3. US politics becomes dominated by the struggle of the House of Clinton aided by massive buyers remorse among corporate leaders of the House of Obama (Biden and his weak regime) and the struggle to replace him, aided by fear in the military and security leadership of the Republicans coming back and someone like Rand Paul or Ted Cruz or DeSantis cleaning house of them in the environment of widespread hunger and world wide depression and weakness abroad.4. Putin will invade Ukraine and roll up to Poland‚Äôs borders in a month, possibly also taking the Baltics. At the same time China will invade Taiwan and after a rough three months conquer it, with heavy casualties and after sinking at least one US Carrier. The US will do nothing but wipe Biden‚Äôs butt.5. Crime will increase ever further, leading to widespread follow home and home invasion robberies, and then kidnapping for ransom or torture/murder. Social media will be awash with livestreams of torture/rape/murder of White victims by blacks and the response will be to ‚Ä¶ legalize all crime by blacks. Along with Cartels offering protection via death squads.6. Warren and the Squad will run wild, getting the weak Biden regime to tax and limit investment in agriculture, real estate, transportation, and more for ‚Äúgreen‚Äù goals as they‚Äôve demanded.7. There will be a Red Tidal Wave, causing panic among the security services and military; Dems will refuse to seat the new Congress and Senators, and use the DC National Guard which is now under the Police Chief‚Äôs control thanks to a bill Biden signed last month to arrest all Republicans for ‚Äúinsurrection‚Äù ‚Ä¶ leading to the coup aimed ostensibly at the Republicans by Gen. Milley and the FBI but in reality to restore the House of Clinton to the Presidency to rein in the Squad and Warren.8. Many states will stage a soft secession. They won‚Äôt make formal declarations just refuse to obey Federal Directives, issue their own money (backed by gold / silver) and institute their own migration and foreign policy with their own military. This will include Texas, Florida, OK, AL, MS, TN, KY, MS, SC, and possibly Ohio, Indiana, and PA. In particular the hated wage/price controls and racial prices and rationing will be ignored, making these places favored by the corporate class as they will be the only places they make money.9. Turkey will simply collapse and a tidal wave of Muslims and Africans will end up in Europe, at least 50 and possibly 100 million. Russia will be invited in to protect: Greece, Serbia, Hungary, Slovenia, Romania, Bulgaria, and possibly Austria. France will become an Islamic Republic with Whites made into serfs and Christianity and alcohol banned, the Louvre and all cathedrals blown up as 30 million Africans and Muslims wash ashore there. Muslims will occupy all of Southern Italy and in desperation a new Pope will accept Putin‚Äôs protection cementing his posturing as the defender of Christianity.10. In the US, mass Central American immigration coupled with out of control black crime will hand over defacto control of much of the Southwest and other areas to the Cartels which will fight deadly street battles with each other as the police sit at home.11. With the end of affordable energy and US global military protection (show in Ukraine and Taiwan to be as useless as a black studies degree) global trade will collapse, food prices will soar globally and most of Africa will march to Europe, over-running those places not defended by Russians.12. Ghislaine Maxwell will not survive January, being found dead in her cell of ‚Äúsuicide‚Äù with all the cameras turned off and the guards conveniently absent.I‚Äôm sure I am overlooking something even more stupid, self defeating, and cruel that either Biden or Hillary! will do.

You forgot to include southern Illinois in your 8th point. Everyone south of Effingham considers themselves in northern Kentucky. It truly is a different world compared to Crook County.

            Doom and gloom may be cathartic, but it isn‚Äôt actionable. And all predictions are probabilistic, but there‚Äôs enough handwriting on the wall to warrant getting up off the couch and rolling up your sleeves in the present tense.No one person is going to alter the course we‚Äôre on, so the name of the game is to focus on what you can do regardless of the Crazy enveloping the Earth. You CAN move out of the city and into a safer haven (rural small town is a good option). You CAN start eating better and exercising more (shed some pounds and add muscle). You CAN either start a personal armory or add to the one you‚Äôve already got (no such thing as too much ammunition either). You CAN plant a garden this year (even if it‚Äôs just a tomato plant in a bucket). You CAN teach &amp; train yourself to be more robust in the face of adversity (plenty of online tutorials &amp; guidance). You CAN become skilled at staying under the radar and moving about incognito. And finally, you CAN start planning for a day when personal tangible action may be the only hope for survival. Smarter, not harder. 4S and focus.

        Here is my black swan prediction for the next 5 ‚Äì 10 years.from what i read, there is a good possibility of a new ‚Äúlittle ice age‚Äù, and that the earth is already in a cooling cycle.  here is an abstract :Since 1990, the Sun has been in the declining phase of the quasi-bicentennial variation in total solar irradiance (TSI). The decrease in the portion of TSI absorbed by the Earth since 1990 has remained uncompensated by the Earth‚Äôs long-wave radiation into space at the previous high level because of the thermal inertia of the world‚Äôs oceans. As a result, the Earth has, and will continue to have, a negative average annual energy balance and a long-term adverse thermal condition. The quasi-centennial epoch of the new Little Ice Age has started at the end 2015 after the maximum phase of solar cycle 24. The start of a solar grand minimum is anticipated in solar cycle 27 ¬± 1 in 2043 ¬± 11 and the beginning of phase of deep cooling in the new Little Ice Age in 2060 ¬± 11. The gradual weakening of the Gulf Stream leads to stronger cooling in the zone of its action in western Europe and the eastern parts of the United States and Canada. Quasi-bicentennial cyclic variations of TSI together with successive very important influences of the causal feedback effects are the main fundamental causes of corresponding alternations in climate variation from warming to the Little Ice Age.=====================as this happens, world food production crashes, and the human population is greatly reduced, world wide.

        ‚ÄúThe icy hand of demographics begins to show up in formerly safe republican areas‚Äù Unfortunately, this will most likely be the most accurate prediction as the ‚Äúleadership‚Äù of the party would rather lose every last race than see another Greene, or Boebert fill the ranks. I believe McCornhole even said so earlier this year, something to the effect of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm perfectly comfortable being in the minority.‚ÄùMost of the people I know are saying the same thing, ‚ÄúWhy should we give them the majority? They won‚Äôt do anything to stop the left.‚Äù and the party itself isn‚Äôt helping it‚Äôs members. I heard a rumor that the state party in Ohio has quietly redrawn Jordan‚Äôs district (most likely at the behest of that repulsive twerp Kasich.) so he now has to run someplace else. They did the same thing to Allen West in FL, courtesy of the Bush &amp; Romney families. This was after his famous, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt come here to make friends‚Äù line in which he stated that his country was under attack from within and he would do everything to stop it.I have no predictions, although a friend of mine who is a captain in the sheriff‚Äôs office told me flat out to move out of NY, as the commies in Albany have made it their mission in life to out California, California, although I‚Äôm not sure where I‚Äôd go. I was thinking MT, possibly TN, but folks like us are running out of places to go, so there you have it. I do have a friend who is really into gardening and she did mention the possible scarcity of fertilizer next year.Z, I love what you do here and please keep it up. Everyone have a Happy New Year!

                    Well if you did come up with a plan and an organization to combat this, you would soon find that your group was made up of around 60% federal agents and/or fed informers.  You would also soon find yourself in an 8√ó8 cell for the rest of your life.So, there is really nothing we can do collectively until FedGov collapses and cannot pay its agents anymore.Until that day all you can do is move to an almost-all-white rural area, find ways to help your neighbors and make friends.  Lift weights, lose weight, grow your own food.   Quietly talk to your neighbors about how you will all respond when the cities collapse and black war bands come to your area looking for food and white pussy.

            The mRNA stuff has been around for a while. Moderna has has a number of trials go bad because of the side effects, Vaccines were seen as a promising route to market (And mRNA technology, and Moderna in particular, has never brought a drug to market) because the side effects multiplied as doses increased- in number not just in size. Vaccines with their ‚Äúone and done‚Äù history looked promising.The drive behind this is to get acceptance of the CRISPR technology that has been used in the genetic modification of crops, for use in humans.(It‚Äôs why Monsanto was snapped up by Bauer despite having a backlog of multi-billion dollar lawsuits pending.)Getting to use this on people is the dream and the end-goal of the transhumanists. Limited function serfdom for you, eternal superlife for them.The Flue panic has succeeded in getting the camel‚Äôs nose into the tent.

            Coronaviruses mutate too quickly and complexly to be thwarted by vaccines. By the time you‚Äôve made a shot, the virus it‚Äôs based on doesn‚Äôt exist anymore.
Every child used to learn this.
Also true of today‚Äôs non-vaccines. The ‚Äúboosters‚Äù being mandated now are against a virus that literally nobody on earth still carries.

            IIRC, Merck tried to make a traditional vaccine (attenuated virus or some such), but then backed out because they came to realize the virus would mutate faster than they could make large enough batches to vaccinate against it. That is, natural immunity would occur faster than induced immunity.

        Predictions:
Roe vs. Wade will hang around. Barrett is a virtue signaler and untrustworthy with her vibrant mudling. Why not adopt poor rural whites? There‚Äôs tons around here that need good families.
I‚Äôll lose my job at the Dept of Corrections. The clot shot isn‚Äôt mandatory yet, but I sense it coming.
Covid will continue but will be mocked and ignored by most. Only the zealots will keep up the charade.
A sex scandal brings down Joel Osteen. Been predicting that for years.
Scott Adams croaks. The shot destroyed his immune system. Look at him. He looks like a zombie.

            My prediction is that there is a pause on immigration.
I always held that the only ones who could ever stop it would be the democrats.  I think they sense it is going sideways for them.
Plus there could be some events that actually force us to shut the border or to get very serious about it very quick.
Less a prediction and more of a hunch.

                    Tons of whites here in rural Florida.It‚Äôs like time stood stillAnd people, still say ‚Äústill‚Äù like ‚Äústeel‚ÄùLots of blacks but they keep to themselves and don‚Äôt go to places I have been going to.Something to consider when looking at demographics in the rural south.   Yes the data show lots of blacks, but unlike Los Angeles or probably most cities they don‚Äôt get up in your business and keep to themselves mostly.  And small town or rural blacks aren‚Äôt the thugs you see in cities and are nice people.  My guess is they hate the urban thugs as much as we do.Not an ‚Äúanswer‚Äù to our dilemma, but this kind of soft segregation is something I can live with if this is going to be as good as it gets.   The landscape certainly is beautiful too.   And plenty of farms for fresh food.

                This is one of the few things that actually depresses me to think about. Let‚Äôs face some unpalatable facts here. Whites are going to be a minority in America. It‚Äôs a bit like saying ‚Äòyou have cancer.‚Äô After the shock and the intense dismay if not grief, you get to the ‚Äòso what to do?‚Äô phase. Separation and secession seem to be the only options. But they require both a complete workover of culture and mentality and a collapse of the current regime (these may be two sides of the same coin). Hell, I‚Äôm talking myself into an accelerationist position here. There is an incredible logic to accelerationism, offset only by the fact that it is a dive into the unknown. Unknown except that it will be extremely uncomfortable.

                    Frankly, a collapse of the USA and/or the West sooner rather than later may be the only thing that can save and preserve the future of our people.The darker people over here can only exist because of the surplus thrown off by white society.  A collapse that eliminates this surplus would leave the subcontinentals and muslims and Africans to fend for themselves, and they are not capable of this outside of tropical regions.  Many would either perish or migrate back to their warm shitholes.  Latinos are surprisingly resourceful and would probably carve out their own shithole region in the southwest.

                        Moreover, there is likely to be way less ethnic violence than doom-sayers predict. Many immigrants came here because they believed it was easier than staying in their home country and fighting and/or working. If they weren‚Äôt lazy or cowardly, they simply would have done what needed done at home, instead of shirking. If they have to fight or work to live here, most likely they‚Äôll just leave again, hopefully to Canada.

                I‚Äôm pretty sure whites are already a minority in this country in absolute terms, or else barely moving the needle at 50%.White on-hispanic share decreased from 63.7% to 57.8% from 2010 to 2020.Furthermore, non-hispanic white includes people from N Africa, ME, and Central Asia who are white but not in the same bio-cultural sphere. We could whittle ‚Äúwhites‚Äù down further but I‚Äôll stop there. There are about 3M MENAs (~0.9%) in this country. Central Asia‚Äôs negligible &gt;1M. And we know about 1.8% of the population are special people.Taking those out brings non-hispanic white down to about 55%. In absolute numbers 182,050,000.Remembering Z‚Äôs comments about illegal immigration being about 3x what the ‚Äòexperts‚Äô usually anticipate ‚Äì 15M ‚Äì that gives 45M illegal aliens. Gets tricky here b/c I‚Äôd have to read how the census bureau compiles their data and accounts for known low response populations. Easiest is just to add 30M onto the total.Adding 30M makes total population = 361M, so non-hispanic, non-MENA white comes out to 50.43%.(182,050,000/361,000,000)We know that whites tend to answer the census in higher numbers so there could be more blacks, hispanics, and other populations. I know we have a lot of friends among hispanics, Jews, and others, this is just a rough accounting. If we cut out the Ellis Island fraternity from the figure to find old stock white Americans the number probably falls to ~40%, and that‚Äôs including the Irish.

            My predictions re: immigration would be:
Immigration from Europe, China, and most Asian countries stops or reverses.
Immigration from Mexico stops.
Immigration from south America and middle east slows down.
A large number of ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù (((elites))) emigrate out.
The party is almost over, so the guests will begin leaving, only the dumbest party crashers will begin to start showing up now. The biggest upside of imperial decline means foreign grifters leave. If the federal government goes bankrupt and has to spend within it‚Äôs means, I‚Äôd imagine a lot of third world imports will begin to leave.

        For discussion‚Äôs sake, I‚Äôm going to be a contrarian and say 2022 is the year the Left finally realizes Hillary! is a busted flush.She has done nothing but lose, going all the way back to 1993. It took them almost 20 years to ram socialized medicine through because she screwed the pooch so egregiously with Hillarycare. Had Bill not somehow been even worse with his trouser mishaps, her shenanigans at the Rose Law Firm would‚Äôve damaged his administration almost as bad. She sent Sandy Burglar into the National Archives to smuggle documents out in his pants. She weaponized the FBI.And that‚Äôs all when she was merely First Lady! As Secretary she was an unmitigated disaster; we don‚Äôt need to rehash it all here. And worst of all, she lost to the Bad Orange Man, that ludicrous buffoon (and though the Media got high off the smell of their own farts with ‚ÄúRussian hacking,‚Äù the Party knows the truth). That‚Äôs 30 straight years of screw ups. I don‚Äôt care how many people she has buried in the Apparat, or how many shadowy assassins she has on call; she‚Äôs a disaster, stem to stern. And not a Bernie Sanders-type disaster, who is happy to get shafted every four years in order to buy another beach house. Shetries,and fails, egregiously, even though they pull out all the stops for her time and again (e.g. cutting deals with Bernie to shaft him as the nominee in 2016; he was cruising before that ‚Äúsuperdelegates‚Äù thing).And yeah, Barack Obama is far too stupid and lazy to build a political machine‚Ä¶ but yet, here we are in Barky‚Äôs third term. Even the Dems eventually figure out when to hold ‚Äôem and when to fold ‚Äôem; after 30 years, I think they finally fold ‚Äôem on Herself.(and I can‚Äôt wait to see who they pick to be Kamala‚Äôs VP. Maybe Bernie finally gets his reward‚Ä¶.?)

            Boarwild:  They‚Äôre killing primarily healthy young White people who‚Äôve been the first to line up and get jabbed.  And do you honestly expect all those devoted White mothers to admit they willingly offered their beloved solo child to Baal?  That they deliberately poisoned them out of social signaling zeal?  No way.  Already the few who‚Äôve protested have claimed they ‚Äòdidn‚Äôt know‚Äô or ‚Äòno one told me.‚Äô  And they‚Äôve still proceeded to push for everyone else to jab their children.Most White women are still firmly on the Karen train, and they won‚Äôt ever get off willingly.  They‚Äôll leave their oppressive White husbands before they‚Äôll forego getting their children vexxed.

Rather, it only seems this way because the most vocal white women are leftists and Covidians whose views are amplified by the media and social acceptance. In contrast, reasonable white women are silenced by peer pressure and social media censorship.And let‚Äôs face it. Mothers who refuse to get their kids vaxxed aren‚Äôt going to brag about it on Facebook, lest they lose their accounts, or even worse, open their front door to see Child Services on their doorstep.

                Most White women are still firmly on the Karen train, and they won‚Äôt ever get off willingly. They‚Äôll leave their oppressive White husbands before they‚Äôll forego getting their children vexxed.
It‚Äôs hard to disagree with this. Going into stores the most dutifully face-diapered demographic are white women of all ages.
Karenism is an enormous problem. I wish I had a reasonable solution to solve it.

                    Women become Karens because men arent imposing a proper moral order on society. I don‚Äôt blame them for yelling at inconsiderate d-bags or apathetic service workers; dealing with those sorts is grating and makes the common part of daily life unpleasant. A lot of men are asleep at a lot switches, which is why so many things suck.

        ‚ÄúConservative Inc. begins to show some serious problems as the decline of their donor base begins to accelerate.‚ÄùOn a somewhat related note.  Salvation Army is currently broadcasting here pleas/apologies from the top ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù that their recent website ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù was a mistake and that they don‚Äôt believe any race is guilty‚Äîor should feel guilty‚Äî for any past misconduct of their people‚Ä¶yada, yada, yada‚Ä¶  A direct refutation of CRT.Further that SA believes in equality of all and that the SA has much charitable work to do and please send them donations (OK, he didn‚Äôt quite say that exactly, but that was the essential meaning of his dribble.)So what about this?  Well, it means that the White race, when woken from it‚Äôs slumber, still has the ability to make these grifters hurt and to affect these woke organizations.  GOP, SA, whomever.I‚Äôve heard SA donations down 40% and still falling.  Their begging letters send to me are returned with a simple: ‚ÄúGo woke, go broke‚Äù scribbled on them.  Screw them.  Don‚Äôt send them a nickel.  Don‚Äôt play that game, they are simply selling ‚Äúindulgences‚Äù.

                    3g4me.  Yep, I would have elaborated, but cut the posting short.  The SA head honcho did *not* really apologize.As an old schooler, there are a number of things we were taught must be included in a sincere apology.  One, the apologist must accept complete responsibility for his actions.  This was not done.Two, the apologist must attempt to correct/redress the misdeed as much as possible. A refutation of CRT was not done, just an attempt to imply ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not what we meant.‚Äù (See item one)Three, the apologist must assure that the wrong will not be repeated. I‚Äôve yet to hear of any of the perpetrators of the woke website post being removed and fired/separated from the organization.So, 3g4me, you are absolutely correct‚Äîthere really was no apology, merely an attempt to win back the naive Whites who mindlessly send the SA organization donations in order to feel good.

                    I don‚Äôt underestimate the stupidity, but the GOP has a special knack for it. I‚Äôm going to offer another prediction here that helps explain why I think this is why Whites will abandon the Republicans rather soon. The GOP will pick up quite a few former Hispanic Democrat seats along the Rio Grande next cycle precisely because those people are hit really hard by open borders. But instead of learning anything, the Republicans will kowtow to Hispanics by throwing the border open even wider ‚Äôcause natural conservatives. They will openly fellate Mestizos and have a few going around preaching in Spanish the virtues of lower capital gains tax rates.They consequently will bleed off more Whites and their new besties will ditch them. Mark it. Something close to this will happen. It just takes losing ten percent of Whites and the GOP gets thrown on the pile with the Whigs.

Their begging letters send to me are returned with a simple: ‚ÄúGo woke, go broke‚Äù scribbled on them.‚ÄùAt one time, I might‚Äôve felt guilty for smiling at this. Not anymore.The SA donations got me thinking‚Ä¶How many of these donations help our people, anyway? My guess is very few. The setup is probably similar to the tax code, where white people pay and other groups benefit.It‚Äôs funny that so many of us never considered this question until they openly disparaged us. ‚ÄúWhy am I paying out when my people get nearly nothing in return?‚ÄùIt makes one consider the larger political picture, that white people have quietly paid their taxes and did their part without question until the powers-that-be started openly hating us. But now that the mask has slipped, it certainly gets one thinking.

                        And what will this money go for? That‚Äôs the question a friend recently asked me after receiving yet another fund-raising text.
It‚Äôs a good question, because the GOP never spends it on things that matter. Stop-the-Steal, in particular, was nothing but a grift.
Like a dumb-ass, I donated to it. Seeing what they did with it (basically nothing) made me decide that I‚Äôll never donate to these hucksters again.

                    Some of these org‚Äôs are so ridiculous in purpose, as to be apparent to any sentient being.Here‚Äôs an example.  One particular local ‚ÄúCharity‚Äù was for a number of years collecting funds and other donations for *toiletries*. Yep, toothbrushes, soap, small towels, etc. for the victims of natural disasters.  They‚Äôd then charter a plane to fly the crap to third world disaster areas.Had a friend who liked the idea.  I could never convince him of the ridiculousness of sending toothpaste to earthquake victims who no longer even have a hovel to brush their teeth in.Then came 9/11 and this organization rolled out the publicity machine and went full bore for the poor NYC ‚Äúvictims‚Äù‚Äînow all dead.  I stated plainly to him, ‚ÄúDo you really believe there is one New Yorker tonight who was involved in 9/11 and needs toiletries?‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou know that none of the ‚Äúvictims‚Äù are homeless, right?  Just dead.‚Äù

            White people are still the majority of the charitable donations, so of course they are going to still have disproportionate power when it comes to organizations like the SA. I have a feeling that if the woke liberal Christians who are currently ruining so many churches push things too far you will see a similar reaction there. I haven‚Äôt seen the numbers but I have a feeling the majority of the donations going to churches come from Whites. Would be a shame if those donations were to stop‚Ä¶With the demographic changes and Whites becoming a minority there could be a silver lining here. We are the ones who have the most to offer in a technological civilization. If White people just said screw it and stopped keeping the lights on things would collapse pretty damned quick. The power is ours if we would only realize it and then use it.

                        Most non Whites prefer to live among their own kind and not among hostile Whites who won‚Äôt allow any one to employ them or given them a dime.We‚Äôll get that universal attitude soon enoughHere  in California, though you‚Äôll never hear it our ability to do big projects is almost nil now. Sure we can build houses well enough but its becoming harder to keep utilities running and do things like rewiring schools.I know a major multinational company name redacted who has lost nearly every engineer in L.A. as they won‚Äôt pay enough and frankly the people actually good at that kind of work as vs credentialed don‚Äôt want to live in L.A.After COVID its went too ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt pay me enough.‚ÄùMass Boomer retirement and die off has gutted the skills base and there are are very few  replacements anywhereIts going to get worse everywhere and most of the US will resemble a 2nd or 3rd tier nation.Now as for demography,Not that here in Cali no one Black or Brown is having huge numbers of kids and where I live the ‚Äúhigh fertility‚Äù types are WhiteAll you need to do is  stop immigration , expel some people and create the conditions where our women have our have babies. You fix the country in a couple of generations.Its not easy but our desire for easy solutions cripples us. Its all hard ugly and cruel going forward aFuture generations will never have the easy pleasant life of say a kid from a solid middle class home in the 80‚ÄôsAt least as the collapse rolls on they‚Äôll eat and carry the future forward which is all they can ask.

            It is with great delight that I watch all the altruistic organizations that I used to support die.
Not only are these ‚Äòwoke‚Äô institutions worthless, but they spit on the ONLY people who volunteer.  The ‚ÄòNew Americans‚Äô that they are so delighted to cater to NEVER lift a finger to do anything ‚Äòfor the good of the people‚Äô.
Volunteerism disappears when Whites disappear.  And I will happily accelerate that process.  Of course I will still volunteer, but it will exclusively be for MY tribe.

        I do wonder if 2022 will be the year when the people down below begin to take over the Republican party on a grassroots level‚Ä¶.a spark to the tinder so to speak.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I have zero hopes for democracy but I wonder if the insanity via the coof, trannies and blatant anti-white propaganda is finally waking normie up.  Biggest sign of the times for me will be whether or not a stronk black womanz like gap-toothed Stacy down in Georgia managed to steal/win the governor‚Äôs race.  White people in GA will lose their fricking minds if she pulls it off and that might possibly be the grain of sand that causes sandcastle that is the state GOP to come crumbling down.A man can hope, right?

            My hope is that an Abrams governorship will fuel the drive for secession by counties contiguous with FL, AL, and TN. America was founded as a federation of European states. It‚Äôs time to ensure that as many real Americans as possible have local self rule by returning to that model. It‚Äôs also time for the Georgian financial class and their cheap labor in Atlanta (an overflowing toilet bowl of diversity) to enjoy living together without the tax base and social capital of the rest of the state to prop up their grift.

        Yesterday, I cheated a bit by giving 10-year predictions, which will never be remembered or checked, so I‚Äôll give my predictions for 2022, so I can see how I did next year.1. Biden and Harris remain in officeI‚Äôll even go so far as to say that Biden makes it through his term in office. However, Harris ‚Äúchooses‚Äù to leave in 2023 because . . .2. GOP wins ‚Äì but not huge ‚Äì in the midtermsThe GOP takes back some seats but not enough to consider it more than a blackeye for the Dems. As Z says, it doesn‚Äôt matter because the GOP actually helps pass some type of Build Back Better version, claiming victor because it‚Äôs a bit smaller than the Dems asked for. GOP voters lose even more faith and respect for the GOP as a result, and this pushes populism even more into the forefront.The Dems use the GOP midterm victory as an excuse to push out Harris but that happens in 2023.3. Inflation is feature, not a bug, to the Fed‚Äôs plan2022 is the year that everyone figures out that the Fed wants a decent amount of inflation for some time and couldn‚Äôt stop it even if the Fed wanted to. The Fed‚Äôs plan is to use inflation to bring down debt to GDP. By running inflation at 5% to 7% for several years, you get nominal GDP growth of 7% to 9%, even though the real economy is only growing at 1% to 2%.If you keep govt bond yields at ~2%, federal revenues grow much faster than interest on the debt and you presumably can grow your way out of your debt. We can already see this happening with debt to GDP falling from 135% to 122%.Which means . . .4. Fed tapers but doesn‚Äôt allow rates to rise muchThe fed will taper but will only reduce it buying of treasuries by around the same amount as the govt is expected to reduce its spending, i.e., no real change. The fed might raise rates a slight bit but will pull back immediately if the stock market starts to tank.Because inflation is here to stay, the bond market realizes that treasuries will be yielding a negative 3% to 5% for the next couple of years. Only financial institutions forced to buy bonds will do so, leaving a void in the market which will be filled by the fed and possibly stablecoins that due to regulation will be forced to hold treasuries.However, the Fed‚Äôs plan to reduce debt to GDP is thwarted by the Dems who pass yet another stimulus package which pushes up the debt despite the low interest rates. In fact, the Dems are so stupid that they think that the low interest rates mean they should borrow like crazy.But the govt has to provide stimulus because . . .5. The real economy slows considerably in 2022The economy will still grow but at a much slower rate. This will push the govt to stimulate and push up the debt, which will be paid for by more fed money printing because no one who isn‚Äôt forced to own treasuries will buy them.The printing will continue, and, as a result, the rest of the world continues laying the groundwork to move away from the dollar as the sole reserve currency.6. China/TaiwanNothing. The Chinese keep up the pressure but play the long game and just let the US slowly decline and let the Taiwanese slowly realize that reunification is going to happen someday.6. RiotsQuiet year. The Dems back off vaccine mandates. The behind-the-scenes money keeps a lid on BLM and Antifa by cutting off a lot of their money. The govt keeps sending people checks.Overall, 2022 is an erosion year. One the surface, things seem relatively calm, but the forces undermining our society and economy continue eating away at their foundation.Happy New Year!

            Hi CoSC, questions regarding predictions:
3. ‚ÄúIf you keep govt bond yields at ~2%, federal revenues grow much faster than interest on the debt and you presumably can grow your way out of your debt.‚Äù Aren‚Äôt bond rates set by market and mirror (within few percent) real inflation? So if real inflation goes to 7%, market dictates bond interest must go to 8 or 9% too?

                Not anymore. The big buyers of treasury bonds these days are the fed, foreign investors (remember, foreign yields are even lower than treasuries) and mutual funds (mostly target date funds that are cost agnostic).The fed is effectively doing yield curve control by buying bonds from the market until it achieves its desired interest rate. Now, the fed doesn‚Äôt control the yields on corporate bonds but they tend to play off of the yields on treasury bonds, so they‚Äôre pretty low too.The fed has been telling the bond market that inflation was temporary, now it has acknowledged that it wasn‚Äôt temporary as it thought, but don‚Äôt worry we‚Äôll tighten to get inflation under control. So far, the bond market has taken the fed at its word. If the fed fails to live up to its word again but not stopping inflation over the next six months or so, the bond market might decide it time to dump bonds of all flavors, which would be a mess.But the fed can‚Äôt tighten too much. It‚Äôll crash the stock market and probably the economy. But not tightening allows inflation to stay high, which pisses off the bond market.The fed is in a tough spot. I feel a bit bad for them. And, frankly, Congress and Biden keep making their job harder.There really is no good way out. If you let inflation run to drive down the debt to GDP (assuming Congress doesn‚Äôt keep spending like crazy, which isn‚Äôt a great assumption), you absolutely crush bond holders.Btw, this is exactly what the U.S. did after WWII. It held interest rates down way below inflation, the govt kept deficits low, and the country grew its way out of high debt. But it came at the cost of killing bond holders. That wasn‚Äôt too big a deal at the time because the economy was going incredibly well and the stock market soared.We don‚Äôt have any of those things in place now.

            Re 6. China/Taiwan. Agree that nothing is going to happen. But nothing will happen less because of China‚Äôs patience and more because Taiwan increasingly doesn‚Äôt want to reunify. Taiwan is richer per capita, has a better quality of life, and doesn‚Äôt want to give that up. And Taiwan now has a model for what reunification looks like in Hong Kong. The model shows that reunification was favorable to China but unfavorable to Hong Kong with its loss of wealth and autonomy. Taiwanese polling now shows increasing interest in maintaining separation from China. This lean towards maintaining status quo and/or declaring independence will increasingly be reflected in their cultural and governmental attitudes (e.g., promotion of we wuz never Chinese mindset, alliance building, military reform, continued increased investment in defense capability, etc)There are good lessens here for DR types in the US. Big rewards exist for any political entity that can reduce/break federal government power and influence. Entities that gain some measure of independence will be better off than ones bound tightest to fedgov. We see this already with demographic shift away from NY, CA towards TX and FL. Enabling policies that continue to loosen fedgov control should be a focus of the right as it begins to win elections in 2022.

Yes, Harris is worse that Hillary, barely. But Hillary is worse than almost anyone else. It just shows how bereft of ideas and talent that the Dems are.

                    The mass diversity plan backfired pretty hard on all of  the Left.The White Left, All for the Blacks , Liberal Latinos and assorted Lefty Asians are all incompatible with one another and as the perpetual 1968 crowd dies off, it breaks down into ethnic bloc votingThe last push of the establishment to hold a multi national fake country together is ‚ÄúConservative Hispanics.‚Äù weird enough. They are a real thing in my neck of the woods Trump flags, One America News, you name it . One guy was running FJB stuff long before it was a thing.They are actually pretty good Americans, staunchly anti immigration , very Right Wing in a populist way . Do not hate Whites. Alas its at most 25% of Hispanics and that‚Äôs being rather generous.It won‚Äôt work and the end result is ethnic bloc voting, White Right and Friends (a tiny number of Blacks, the Hispanics above and a few Asians) against everyone else.This will end up in dissolution of powers and once reserve currency stops being a thing or inflation stays around for a while, the union will just get weaker.Eventually some Stacy Abrams type will end up running the  Donkeys and the net result will just be a big fat no. Good chance of a collapse.Good for us.As long as the White percentage is whatever comes next is at 75% it can be shoehorned into working.This won‚Äôt be as White as  when we were founded but the odd abuela  here and there isn‚Äôt going to matter very much.If we get very lucky we can shoot the orcs and the money boys and  leave a nation that is 80% White Right  maybe a bit more and we‚Äôll do OK at managing our decline

                        A rejuvenated White America could use minorities as an imperialist export. American minorities are supposedly proud of their heritage, but they‚Äôre VERY proud to be American vis a vis their cousins in the old country. Imagine ruling Mexico through repatriated Mexican-Americans and the proverbial third sons of white families who have the impulse for adventure.
Don‚Äôt think African-Americans would do as well in Africa but I‚Äôm very willing to try.

        Happy New Years you guys!Z, I am wondering what the future holds for the real dissidents. Guys like yourselves, the folks here, the wanks and wits at Blab. I dunno if I should say this‚Ä¶ but awhile back you said something and the rotten wood between my ears began to smolder.About libertarians, you said akin to ‚Äúthey just sit on the sidelines, pretending to hold the moral high ground as they snipe at the real players out on the field.‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ but I am beginning to see the Dissidents in that light too. Do you think the dissidents can ever go beyond secret meetings and internet enclaves? Or does the system have to crash and burn first?

            if you wanted to go surfing, what would you do at the water‚Äôs edge, to make a wave appear?  that is the answer to your question.  the thing about emergent systems is‚Ä¶they take time to emerge :). noone has to wait for the great leader, or a meet up, or anything else.  every person is reacting and changing right now, not just one set or group.  live *your* life in a way that facilitates the changes you want to see in society.

                    exactly.  and even then, you have to *wait* for the wave to appear.  two seperate and necessary steps.  you cannot conjur the wave when you want it, nor can people start acting out for change (on our side) until the conditions occur organically.

        Here is my humble offering on the prediction pyre:I predict a LOT of clinical depression and real malaise in the liberal circles, as they find that the COVID hysteria will not really end. At least in the Blue Cities. These people, especially the ones in GOV/NGO/academia (and quite a few medical) really do believe in ‚Äúending,‚Äù and not the real-reality tour of neverending hotfixes, patches, mission creep (of the unstable complex system type)‚Ä¶ These are the ones that came up to me in March ‚Äô20, saying, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry! In a month or two, it will be like the Roaring Twenties! There will be so much pent-up buyer demand when this is over, you‚Äôll have trouble keeping up! There will be celebrating in the street!‚Äù ‚Ä¶ I openly guffawed at them, and they stood there in confusion. Now, I see that confusion coming back to the same people, but increased. I am seeing a lot of depression save for the real over-the-top ones.If you are in the online therapy business, get ready for a whalloping good business year.Bless you, Z, on your escape.

                    Ayn Rand, let‚Äôs see what she was all about. She marries at the fine youngish age of 24, to a guy she picks up, by obstructing some movie making or something. Later this cuck gives up his job so ‚Äòshe can focus on writing.‚Äô It will surprise no one that this marriage produced zero offspring. Later she has an affair with a boy 25 yrs her junior, with hubby knowing about it. Class act.This was a high-testo frustrated broad going through life shit-testing the cr*p out of everything and everyone. In fact, her writings are so conspicuously anti whatever the commies were doing that, speaking of Stalin, guess who she was probably shit-testing? Every American had failed her shit-tests by then. Hitler‚Äôs not only dead, he turned out to be a loser. And let‚Äôs be honest, killing 20 million, locking up God knows how many and winning a world war, that‚Äôs pretty F-ing alpha. Ayn Rand‚Äôs writings are the angry sh*t-tests of the only man who could possibly have passed her tests, Uncle Joe ‚ÄúI count my killings in millions‚Äù Stalin. She‚Äôd be pleasantly surprised if he was in hell, waiting for her.

I normally never use the stupid parentheses but ((Ayn Rand)) ugh.
A nihilistic serial killer loving Eurasian Jewess however much we share a detestation for tyranny and a supposedly love for freedom is no model for a European society.

        Okay I‚Äôm going to make a prediction, everyone else did.
Covid is going to ramp down but then another virus is going to appear and all the same measures will go in place but this time faster because everyone‚Äôs prepped and if that one fades another one will appear and this is going to be a constant ratchet action until iworldwide total control has been achieved in the name of health or total collapse. I know it sounds grim but I think total collapse is the best case scenario for white people.

                These things always burn out, usually within three years, for two very good reasons. First, by the time you notice an infectious disease is deadly, it‚Äôs too late to prevent deaths. The panic, therefore, is a delayed reaction and eventually people calm down and realize that the germ is here to stay and first round of death was inevitable.Second, economic problems rear their heads and force health concerns to take a backseat or be an individual matter. Essentially, there‚Äôs no point not risking getting the virus if that means you‚Äôll starve. Now that inflation is coming in hot and supply chains are in complete disarray, a week of the flu pales in comparison to chronic homelessness, so most people and policy-makers are going to brush off health concerns and focus on economic concerns.Hopefully, the panic at the COVID will remind people that prevention is better than treatment, and that hygiene is better than medicine. The best way to defend against infectious diseases is functioning indoor plumbing, regular trash collection, controlled borders, and consistent hand washing. Haphazard jabs and intubation are poor substitutes.

        Emmanuel Macron will win reelection in France, defeating V√©lerie P√©cresse in the second round of elections.  It is, however, possible that P√©cresse will contest the election, due to mail-in and electronic voting used because of covid restrictions.  If she does, the Constitutional Court will rule the Macron victory legitimate.  Covid vaccination will be made mandatory and there will be substantial tax hikes later in 2022.Both Biden and Harris will be in office on December 31, 2022.  2023 will be the year to watch since Harris can finish Biden‚Äôs term and still be elected to two additional terms.  She may be personally unlikeable, but there are strong forces backing her.

If he were to win (possible, especially if France has another big terror attack before the election) his would be the most right wing democratic government w/r/t immigration and cultural issues since you know who in 1933.
BTW, ignore all election polling with this guy. Zemmour will be so anathematized by the media that there will be few honest answers to polling questions prior to the election. If he is elected, it will seem to be a surprise.

The reason I am suspicious is precisely the very large amount of media coverage of the guy.Like Le Penn who got lots of coverage and did everything to undermine herself seemingly.
Real opposition without backers in most of Europe, especially given the huge number of speech crime laws, get memory holed and harassed by the police not invited on 3 hours shows.

                Macron was the choice of the elite in 2017 but his election was probably legitimate; Marine Le Pen just frightened too many people and came off poorly in the debate with Macron.  An election contest between Macron and P√©cresse will be much closer.  (The policy differences between the two are difficult to measure with a micrometer, and Macron‚Äôs image as a competent manager is tarnished.)  Because of that, Macron will be much more tempted to resort to electoral engineering (electronic and mail-in votes, in-person voting only by vaccinated people) to win, using Covid and the public health crisis, as an excuse.I like Zemmour, but the media hostility is beyond intense and he is having a difficult time getting on the ballot and holding rallies.

Now that the Establishment has given the Feebs the permission to manufacture evidence‚Ä¶ infiltration may no longer be necessary‚Ä¶Just like those poor Jan 6 ‚Äúdomestic terrorists‚Äù. Have a few beers too many, end up in an unofficial tour of the capital buildings‚Ä¶ and into the can you go with no legal rights.
I predict somebody is going to get shot and seriously deserve it. Maybe a larger version of the Kyle Rittenhouse deal but with more players and more bodies.

        ‚ÄúThe collapse of conservative talk radio will accelerate as that audience ages off and people simply stop listening to terrestrial radio in general.‚ÄùI hope not.  The nicest and most beautiful radios ever made were AM only.  Radios started turning into ugly plastic boxes right around the time FM stereo got standardized in the early-mid 60s.In Europe there is no AM radio anymore.  But conservative talk radio has helped keep AM alive in America and I get to tune into the Grand Ole Opry  every Friday night on 650 AM from more than a thousand miles from Nashville on my beautiful cathedral AM radio.  I can pick up Chicago routinely on AM, even with an el-cheapo transistor radio.

                Yeah, but they also got junkier and uglier.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I like modern technology as much as the next guy, but the styling is nothing like the old style.  They do make some ‚Äúreplica‚Äù radios of the old days, but they‚Äôre just so cheesy.
It wasn‚Äôt just transistors. By the mid 70s, 1/2 of the functions of a radio were in ICs.  Today you cannot even buy a discrete component radio.  I don‚Äôt use any modern radios in my house.  They tend to be very choppy and unless it‚Äôs high end, the AM is just horrible.

        Not a prediction, but rather my sincerest hope is that 2022 becomes the USA version of the Year of Living Dangerously. As soon as the latte shortage commences, Normie starts his descent into visceral madness and goes postal by first flopping on the floor spastically, then jumps up into a vortex of whining and wailing, and finally runs out into the street with a .357 revolver he‚Äôs been keeping in a shoebox in the closet (and has never fired before). At which point he gets gunned down by a 90 year old spinster firing a shotgun through her front window. Then the butterfly effect kicks in and it‚Äôs Katy-bar-the-door time. Before you know it, lead is flying everywhere and no one can hit a damn thing except by accident. The frenzy spreads like wildfire and entire communities erupt in an orgy of pent-up rage. Eventually the pitchforks come out and mobs form up at the doors of city hall and boardrooms everywhere. When the smoke clears and the lamp posts are full, rebirth may finally begin with the death of affluence and it‚Äôs handmaiden, the Crazy.One can dream!

        My 2022 Prediction: Biden will die some time in early spring, and, in a panicked scramble worthy of an 80s sitcom, his handlers rig him up to a series of fishing wires and manipulate his corpse while a ventriloquist reads the words from offstage, somewhere in the wings. People notice that this Biden no longer struggles with reading the teleprompter and is no longer even prone to gaffes. They also shoot Biden full of formaldehyde, which improves his complexion and smell quite a bit. His approval ratings each Obama first term levels.Meanwhile, Adam Schiff, Jerry Nadler, and Merrick Garland, reading auguries in the entrails of a disemboweled gentile baby, learn from their father, the Fallen Prince, that they must quickly arrest and imprison the meddlesome priest Ron DeSantis, the only one who could potentially thwart their unholy mission. Reading the signs correctly, they begin to seed friendly media outlets in the news with stories of DeSantis‚Äôs Russian collusion. When it comes to light, that, much like Michael Cohen, DeSantis once visited Prague and even watched ‚ÄúRocky IV‚Äù on cable, he will be imprisoned, at least until after the election. The Republicans, having no other choice, unleash their last Hail Mary, the child that Meghan McCain sired, in secret, with her father John McCain, to run against the new and improved Biden. ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äù McCain says all the right things, about being inclusive, fighting white supremacy, getting the Hispanic vote, washing Hasidic feet at the Wailing Wall, but it is not enough. Joe Biden takes the Oath a second time.Kamala Harris, after accepting a fruit basket from Hillary Clinton, dies of polonium 204 poisoning. A way is cleared for the Queen to slowly ascend her throne.Happy New Year.

        I‚Äôve already thrown my hat in with predictions yesterday so it would be unsportsmanlike to hedge. But I‚Äôll predict this:‚Äì Biden will not be replaced. B/c how do you replace Harris. Short of being impeached she can‚Äôt be forced to resign and she won‚Äôt. This is a slithering career woman willing to hand out BJs for gain. Is she gonna resign the technically second-highest perch in the federal government?? Dream on.‚Äì There will be serious, continued inflation in the US and probably the rest of the world. You can split hairs over when inflation is ‚Äòhyperinflation‚Äô and 2022 will not be the year when the $2,000,000,000 bill with George Floyd‚Äôs face, hits the street. But there will be high inflation and some will call it hyperinflation. Food prices in particular will be critical to whether this leads to serious unrest.‚Äì Gold, already at 60:1 against silver by weight, against a normal rate of 30-35:1, will get even more expensive as ppl and nations alike frantically look for safe havens for their holdings.‚Äì Israel is not going to attack Iran conventionally. If they were going to do that, they would have done so long ago. It is quite possible that the Chinese, the Russians or possibly the Indians, all of whom have reasonable relations with both Israel and Iran, will broker a behind-the-scenes deal of reassurance between Tehran and Jerusalem. It is possible this is already happening. When was the last time you heard Iran call for Israel to be wiped out? With Afghanistan under hardcore Sunni control, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia cosying up, Syria unsettled and the world generally less predicable, Tehran has more pressing things to worry about than Israel. And Israel knows they can probably only mildly retard Tehran‚Äôs program with airstrikes. Both countries are quite happy not to be the focus of world attention right now.‚Äì Ukraine, same old sh*t as last year. Some huffing and puffing, possibly flare-ups here and there and ‚Äò4th generation warfare‚Äô but no conventional war or invasion. Both Moscow and Washington understand that the other side will be pushed into a corner of ‚Äòescalate or lose face‚Äô if either pushes the envelope on the ground and both Moscow and the saner heads in DC understand that you never trap a major nuclear power with those options.‚Äì Taiwan all depends on what happens in the US. If America seems weakened China will up the ante but they will not launch a conventional war and they can‚Äôt go 4th generation in a place where 90% of the populace is against reunification. They will quite possibly try to pressure Taiwan to fold but this will only succeed if the US disappears from the scene because of domestic problems.‚Äì  Vaccine mandates across the world will be relaxed as it is increasingly clear that the vaccines don‚Äôt really work and as concerns over their safety grows. There will be growing demands for an ‚Äòimpartial‚Äô investigation into the origins of SARS-CoV-2, the Covid virus. China will vehemently resist these, augmenting the increasing negative view of China. This will ironically help protect Taiwan as China‚Äôs diplomats try to convince Xi that China does not need to exacerbate its image problem.‚Äì There will be serious riots in both America and Europe, over Covid, ethnic relations, the economy and other messes. Each riot is a roll of the dice about whether someone will open fire creating a significant body count. If this happens, domestic tranquility in the respective country could be balancing on a pinhead.‚Äì I have an unsettling sense that 2022 could be a year of high-profile assassinations. These being entirely contingent events it is impossible to predict who would be hit. But growing public anger combined with an unusually broad array of high profile targets makes this seem likely. Biden won‚Äôt be hit though, because of the Harris life insurance (against an inside job) and he‚Äôs almost never out in public.

            I think you‚Äôre right about all of these, especially the riots. I‚Äôm frankly amazed we haven‚Äôt seen Amritsar II: Electric Boogaloo somewhere in Europe (or Australia) already, and it‚Äôs all but guaranteed if the knockoff Westworld animatronic robot that the Media calls ‚ÄúJoe Biden‚Äù is forced to call out the National Guard somewhere.

                In the US things are just a tinderbox. Blacks are angry and all others are fed up with blacks. But contingent events are always hard to predict. The more riots, the more destruction, eventually someone will dump a mag then there we are.In Europe, spearheaded by Austria, they are pushing through compulsory vaccinations. Having forced jabs may just be the trick to turning the incredibly lethargic European masses into action, especially as rumors, most of them probably wildly exaggerated, about deaths from vaccines, grow exponentially. Europe also has the Muslim problem so there should be plenty of tinder for the bonfire.

                        Germany is the 3d printed gun capital of the world and despite what people think Europe caveat maybe the UK is easily armed up.  I suspect guns and ammo  are rather more common than most  think.As for riots and protests  and such, we aren‚Äôt allowed to the see them but they are huge. Problem is they are incoherent the Euros , Anglo Sphere and US to be honest have yet to be willing to understand they are governed by soulless monsters who need to go.Its understandable modern life is fragile and who the hell wants to run society who is sane?I do think that the nuclear power phase out will speed up the end. Germans ability to fund a welfare state much less put food on the table depends heavily on manufacturing  and while that is less competitive than it used to be, expensive power will cripple the economy.This will speed up the systems end but by how much I do not know.

        Why don‚Äôt we all face the music and realize that the U.S.A. and the rest of the world for all it matters, has already collapsed and the process is deepening as we go further over the event singularity.Most people just think every stupid thing going on right now is a temporary event. For example, my retired cousin is drooling over the prospects of buying one of those $90,000 pickup trucks. I said, ‚ÄúWhy? You‚Äôll never be able to get parts for it in a few years.‚Äù But those kind will keep right on rolling on until there‚Äôs weeds growing out of the cracks of every car dealership and China Big Box store as far as the eye can see.There‚Äôs lots of talk how all of the local Wal-Marts and Big Sams here in my area are supposedly going to fire half of their workers after January. It has something to do with them having too many workers to stock an ever decreasing or nonexistent amount of stock. The signs of deepening collapse are everywhere, but I suppose it won‚Äôt really sink in until the only food available will be that you have to cook. I await with great glee at the prospects of women complaining about having to cook every meal, just like they did in A.D. 1933,  if they don‚Äôt want to starve. You know, there may be some justice to come out of this after all.

My favorite is people who insist they can‚Äôt cook because they don‚Äôt have an 80,000 dollar kitchen, while their great-great-grandparents cooked far superior meals to what they could ever do on dirt floors.

                People are insane. I glanced at a few minutes of the Property Brothers on a TV at the gym and this couple was renovating their kitchen for $150k. In these parts, you could buy a decent house for cash with that kind of money.
As for me, I‚Äôve been amazed what I can do with a $70 air fryer. Those things are great. Simple, quickly, and evenly cooked as long as you leave some space and shake or flip halfway through the cycle.

I‚Äôm cooking for one. I think in most of my use cases it makes more sense to use a small appliance like that or a countertop toaster oven, rather than firing up the full-sized range.
I also have an Instapot, and it‚Äôs pretty good. I don‚Äôt really use it for meat other than making pulled pork, chuck roasts, or beef stew.

            Coalclinker:  Does anyone have any anecdotal data about restaurants having trouble sourcing reliable food supplies?  We don‚Äôt really eat out, so I can‚Äôt say.  One local grocery store bakery was out of product a few days ago (no fresh cookies or French bread) but the others were fine.  Again, no real shortages here in DFW, but prices are sky high.I updated to newer model crockpot.  I never joined the Instapot craze, although I do have a pressure cooker I‚Äôve never used tucked away somewhere.  Making lots of use of the vacuum sealer I bought 6 months ago and my new chest freezer is full (and we have ensured means to keep it running).Trying to find the line between crazy and prudent for what is certain to be an unsettling ear.

                For you (and for any who grow any of their own food, or who plan to do so):
Baker Creek heirloom seeds:https://www.rareseeds.com/
And Green Generations, as the best source for paramagnetic rock dust:https://www.greengenerations.com/products.html
because fertilizer prices are continuing to rise and, with it, food prices. And that‚Äôs chemical fertilizer. Paramagnetic rock dust re-mineralizes the soil and produces nutrient-dense food. Also, because paramagnetism converts ULF energy waves in the earth‚Äôs mantle into photons, you also get close to 100% seed germination if you use paramagnetic rock dust to germinate seeds.

                    I like the idea of heirloom seeds. Did you know that West Virginia and the Big Sandy Valley are where beefsteak tomatoes came from? The very first beefsteak plant discovered supposedly came up as a chance seedling in a pile of flood debris

                My anecdotal supply chain report is that the Hy-Vees up here in Hawkeye land are quite well-stocked with most things, though the bottled water section was a little thin, which I believe is due to people grabbing extras for the incoming blizzard.There were tons of semis on I-80 in Illinois during the ride in here. Visually, that made it hard for me to believe there is a driver or truck shortage right now. The truck depots I passed seemed to have quite a few cabs and trailers in stock, but it was hard to judge their condition from the road.

                My elderly mother loves those bacon cheese potatoes and ‚Äúsenior‚Äù coffees from Wendi‚Äôs. They have run out of both items before. I don‚Äôt eat out, but I do notice when the grocery stores don‚Äôt stock items I used to buy, for months at a time.I have an old Crockpot from the 1970‚Äôs. It actually has a heavy glass lid and the removable pottery liner that says ‚ÄúMade in U.S.A.‚Äù on the bottom of it. It does make good soup, but when I want to make that old Appalachian staple brown bean and ham soup, you can‚Äôt beat an old Revere Ware stainless steel pot with the copper bottom. I let it simmer all day.

            how do you reconcile those rumors with the very real problem of finding enough workers?  Can Walmart stay in business with half the revenue (because if you fire half your workforce, you lose sales capacity with them)?  why not wait until they actually do something, before spreading fear porn?  or if you really are shitting your britches, just keep it to yourself.

                Perhaps they are really stupid enough to not care. The family members that run that outfit today certainly aren‚Äôt as sharp as Sam Walton was. Walmart is literally a monopoly of grocery stores and low end retailing. They have run nearly every family business and American made supplier out of business in every town they set up in. All monopolies eventually die, and in the not too far off future there will be towns with no stores left at all. It will all take decades to rebuild, one family business at a time.

        My primary and secondary prediction could be reversed based on the fall-out from the former.The first is the Covid climb-down proves exceptionally difficult. The Regime really wants to declare victory and go back to traditional graft and demagoguery. Several components are in stark opposition, though. The least important of these, the Karens, also are the crazier and more vocal. They may go to their graves, possibly by mass suicide and/or the Regime taking them out, but these types are never giving up their masks, their social media rants, and bi-weekly vaccines. The most important element, the WEF, has made fortunes but not gotten their Great Reset and Feudalism 4ever. That is the wildcard: do they take their winnings or continue to sit at the table? The prospect of their inflated assets becoming worth less may force them to cash in their chips. The middling Covidian factions, Big Pharma, the medical industrial complex, and scavenger politicians, can be threatened enough to fall into line and declare we should put our hand to the television set and be healed.The secondary prediction is the one that could flip and become the most important. The Regime will conduct some sort of phony war with Russia, largely words and immediately violated sanctions. Again, the economic instability will act as a brake on anything beyond kabuki. Also, the realization that even ‚ÄòMurica! cucks are indifferent at best will penetrate their bubble. But‚Ä¶A certain Tribe of psychopaths dominate State and the military. They want to take the entire world down with them, except, of course, for their Mother Country, to avenge granny‚Äôs rape at the hands of the Cossacks. These monsters could slip up or even intentionally ignite a nuclear and/or world ward. They certainly have bribed enough political and corporate sociopaths to make this happen. It would, and likely will, be ironic to see ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù privately read the Tribe the riot act.There will be no hyperinflation, as you pointed out, but it still will be horrible. If there is one silver lining there, inflation puts a brake on the Covidians and Avenge Granny sect. The inflation also will put the federal government on the ropes because the White Devil will start to push back and god knows, no matter how half-assed, that terrifies them.

            You think Dems are the only ones importing immigrants? Bush II set up a massive amnesty during his term.

            Option B: so many Republican voters stay home in 2022 that the government loses all legitimacy, and the GOP collapses because you can‚Äôt horse trade 12 Senate votes.I happily tore up my ballot and threw it in the trash last month.  We can‚Äôt reform an illegitimate government by participating in the charade and giving it legitimacy.My vote in 2022 will only happen if the GOP runs explicitly on impeaching and removing the usurper, destroying the IC, and impeaching and removing most Federal Employees behind the Covid debacle.  Oh, and unlimited subpoenas of FBI and DOJ lots of targets there from Russiagate to USA Gymnastics non-prosecutions of FBI Agents to the 1/6 false flag.

        My Predictions:I kinda think that 2020-2021 was the step down the staircase using Z‚Äôs analogy but now it‚Äôs time for a leveling off for a couple of years.The Dems will indeed suffer loses this fall and the Republicans will all act like Lindsay Graham at a gay bar and offer themselves up to the Dems globo homo agenda.Never the less the Dems will have a hysterical fit and hold out hope for 2024 which I predict is the next step down because the republicans will somehow win the Presidency back threatening the intelligence apparatus and setting off a color revolution.I think we kinda coast for a couple more years before the next major crisis but who knows?No one does.We are fragile domestically on many fronts and we also have many matchboxes overseas.Happy New Year to all!

        I think it will be very hard to pull back on the COVID stuff, and not just because of the crazy left and the (((media))).
The entire medical-industrial complex has organized themselves around this new religion, and they have become the new high priests.  They don‚Äôt want to relinquish this status.  And COVID being minimized would call into question their self-proclaimed heroism.
This group plus the Davos-types intend to force their new sacrament on everyone multiple times (jabbing), and they won‚Äôt give up until either we‚Äôre dead or they‚Äôre dead.

            Netherlands has already announced 6 (SIX) jabs towards 2023 and are spending billions on the vaxx. Canada and other countries are going the same way. Too many people are too invested in this ‚Äì psychologically and materially.

                Ontario is now letting nursing home patients receive their 4th dose.
All 18+ are eligible for the 3rd dose, and the government is begging us that it is of utmost importance to all get our triple jab. So we can go back to normal or something.
I‚Äôm expecting the definition of ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù to change soon to only 3+ doses.

                I‚Äôm gonna go with 2022 as, oddly enough, the Year of Living Coofingly for this reason. You and I may be sick to death of Covidism, mandates, and all the rest of it. That‚Äôs because we‚Äôre sane, productive (when not being forcibly idled) and have come up with our own reasons to keep the shotgun out of our mouths. Most people aren‚Äôt so lucky.Every society needs to offer the masses two main things ‚Äì a moral order, and an economic system they can participate in. Traditional Western society had Christianity for the former and simple subsistence for the latter. At some point in the 20th century it became necessary to sort of gin up substitutes for these things. The Cold War nicely filled both roles, structuring both the moral and economic order on both sides.But now what? By about 2010 it was obvious the Islamists couldn‚Äôt fill the shoes of the Communists. Now we have the perfect thing, and like the Cold War, it solves both problems. Morally, is there anything more holy than wearing the Mask of Faith and taking the Needle of Communion? Is there any amount of money the mathematically illiterate masses won‚Äôt spend to feel a tiny bit safer from a tiny threat? Coofism is an infinite source of moral outrage and self-righteous fulmination on the one hand and an infinite jobs program for the increasing numbers of people too stupid or irrational to do useful work. Coofism can also outlive the Coof because at its core, it is a protection racket to keep people ‚Äúsafe‚Äù from insignificant threats of some kind of contagion. This can be anything from a strain of the flu to some other coronavirus to the next 15 variants of Covid.Finally, a bit of an aside on the ‚Äúmoral order‚Äù aspect: I occasionally post on Quora under my real name as basically a ‚Äúconcerned libertarianish conservative‚Äù. Quora is supposed to be the internet forum for the ‚Äúsmart people‚Äù. Of course, it‚Äôs mostly just a place where the sort of people who read Huffpo hang out to jerk each other off. One thing I‚Äôve seen lately though is a definite undercurrent of hate towards the unvaxxed. It‚Äôs not the usual anemic disdain and condescension these people have towards rednecks, fundamentalist Christians, or other ‚Äúinferiors‚Äù either. This is good ol‚Äô fashioned Klan-level hang-that-nagger-from-the-live-oak H8!The obvious thing for the ruling class to do is to mobilize these people somehow. They have no deep pool of popular approval to draw strength from so maybe a pool of hate for the evil germy unvaxxed will work. Likewise, millions of people who are really just basic grillers are suspicious of the vax and refuse to take it. This provides a radicalizing force for them and gives dissidents an opportunity to structure their rage. This would actually be my guess for the polarizing issue that leads to the Boog.

                The sickcare industrial complex is kind of terrifying.
In almost every metropolitan or micropolitan areas in the US, sickcare is always a top 5, usually top 3, and not infrequently the top employer in the area.
They know exactly why they refuse to talk about prevention, diet, exercise, and sleep.

                    It‚Äôs been obvious for a ridiculously long time that the medical innovations* that actually increased life span in the West were made generations ago and that some things that aren‚Äôt even ‚Äúmedicine‚Äù played a huge role as well. Those things being the availability of fresh food in the off season, knowledge of the value of vitamins and minerals, and the advent of modern sanitation so that shit and piss wasn‚Äôt running in the streets. That stuff was also paid off generations ago and requires maybe $500/person/year to maintain. The other 9 quadrillion dollars worth of ‚Äúmedicine‚Äù is to keep us all technically alive while we‚Äôre 300% overweight and diabetic. It‚Äôs still possible that some biochemical genius will figure out how to retard aging and change the whole game but even biomedical research is now dominated by wammen who panic at the sight of an integral.Viewed this way, the Covid panic is perfectly understandable. We‚Äôre used to the idea of spending exponentially increasing amounts of money to gain ever diminishing benefits. Pushed far enough any such process eventually moves into the part of the curve past the inflection point where you‚Äôre still spending more and more but now actually getting negative ‚Äúbenefits‚Äù. The Covid panic destroyed trillions in wealth, 10s of millions of jobs and businesses and may even have failed on its own terms since untold numbers of people have been killed now by the panic itself and its consequences.Nonetheless, Covid has certainly ‚Äúcreated jobs‚Äù too. I‚Äôm looking forward to the day when it or whatever hysteria follows it creates so many jobs and so much wealth that we‚Äôre reduced to African levels of poverty.* Early medical innovations: I‚Äôm actually going to put vaccines for things like rubella, measles, and of course polio here as well. These were developed at a time when our institutions were less corrupt and science wasn‚Äôt quite the meth-head whore she‚Äôs become today.

                        Antibiotics are a big one too.
But yeah, as you said, sanitation improvements are big.
I don‚Äôt overthink it, just stay active, don‚Äôt get fat, don‚Äôt drink excessively, don‚Äôt do drugs, don‚Äôt smoke. (80% of Americans seem to not be able to do this).
Antibiotics + better sanitation + basic health practices should be good enough to live into your 80s these days. Unhealthy people are living into their mid 70s now.

                    Everyone knows this stuff but the US population including the non Whites is aging. California is worried it will soon be a retirement aged state and that‚Äôs with massive immigration.This means a lot of sickness. Also a lot of people have bad DNA from bad breeding . I don‚Äôt think they even do basic blood tests anymore.This is why the push for immigration BTW, the migrant exporting nations are running out of people . Not India yet (its getting there) but our leader know the Indians will gladly replace them immediately as they did the Jews in Antwerp‚Äôs Diamond Industry.

            It‚Äôs very possible the Flu World Order scheme just can‚Äôt work. It requires near universal compliance from the masses so that the dissenters can be tidily rounded up or left to rot with no access to goods or services. That means everybody has to go along with getting BOOSTED every 3-6 months with something that makes them sick. I just don‚Äôt think even a bare majority of people are willing to do this. Maybe 15%, the true believers, will do this but not even 51%.I think the idiots in charge actually believe in their modeling divination and the oracle said they could successfully use their proven techniques in behaviorism to get the entire global population to sign up for this ridiculous regime. Turns out they were wrong and it‚Äôs not working. Now their models are telling them something different. There isn‚Äôt enough uptake. Something like 50% in America are double vaxxed. It should be well above 90% by now. They clearly have to change course because under these conditions they can‚Äôt predict much less steer events.My prediction is that once the Covid panic is securely on a downward trajectory they will immediately launch into a new panic. Probably a racial apocalypse or a climate emergency, either of which they could engineer with their various tools. They could do another pandemic or, hell, bring out the space alien invasion they‚Äôve clearly been planting seeds for. Whatever they do the purpose will be to continue the need for the various digital IDs, QRs, green passes, and whatnot.Probably the most likely will be a currency collapse, because the stage is already set and new digital currencies will necessitate digital IDs and UBI / social credit schemes will let us own nothing and be of great cheer.I‚Äôm certain we will go from this engineered crisis directly into another. The question is what crisis and will the NGO Kissinger types behind all this be able to effectively direct the vast global network of managers who have already burnt up their political capital these past 21 months?

                ‚ÄúSomething like 50% in America are double vaxxed.‚ÄùNo reason whatsoever to believe these figures. Or ANY of their figures.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ the stage is already set and new digital currencies will necessitate digital IDs and UBI / social credit schemes ‚Ä¶ .‚ÄùALL of those schemes rely TOTALLY on an UNFAILING supply of electricity. Which we don‚Äôt have. And aren‚Äôt going to.Nordstream II not approved by German Foreign Minister b/c ‚ÄúRussian aggression.‚Äù And Germany has gotten rid of their nuclear power supply. And JB shut down our oil pipeline. And fracking has run its course and is no longer profitable. And China has lost the great majority of its food crops for the past two years in a row. And it was already a net importer of food. And their domestic supply of coal (already of low quality) is fast dwindling. And the supply chain is getting shakier, which includes fuel deliveries. And there are already rolling blackouts on both coasts. And California is shutting down the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant. And without an UNFAILING supply of electricity, there ain‚Äôt gonna be no total-surveillance state. No digital ‚Äúcurrency.‚ÄùNorway‚Äôs coal supply is dwindling. So is their North Sea oil.France is not in bad shape and probably won‚Äôt be, but the rest of Europe has zilch in the way of fossil fuels. And without fossil fuels, there cannot be windmills and solar panels. They can‚Äôt be manufactured or transported or put in place or maintained without fossil fuels. Solar panels cannot be recycled. China controls the rare earth elements supply and is even now taking steps to tighten its grip on that essential resource. Wind-power is impossible without rare earths AND oil.There is not going to be a total-surveillance state. It‚Äôs just physically impossible. Bitcoin is on its last legs. Get out while you can.China‚Äôs oil imports have to go through the Strait of Hormuz and the Straits of Malacca.The Chinese infrastructure projects in the Panama Canal Zone were stopped by Trump, but Biden is now letting them go ahead, but where will they get the energy resources? And if they do, where will everybody else get theirs?The world is grinding to a halt. That means everything and everybody. Including Big Brother.

        What‚Äôs your prediction on the Roe v. Wade ruling?
My guess is that it is rolled back federally, and sent to the state level. Access to abortion stays more or less the same as before, with the few remaining red state clinics shutting down.
White feminists will protest and lash out but there will be no real consequence as the abortion debate is mostly a white person debate (ideological) and white feminists are no longer as relevant as they think they are.

I have always wondered how to describe that succinctly, thank you trumpton!
As for ‚Äúunable to detect‚Äù, I think it‚Äôs another learned ideal: projection.
One side projects goodwill, the other bad intent, they hear only what they want to hear.So frustrating.

        Probably as good a forecast as any.  What will make things interesting is the number of random variables is higher than ever.  A real sleeper is fertilizer prices and natgas supply in general.  One of my kids is in the LNG shipping business and the average person has no clue how disordered those markets are right now, nor the number of downstream products, like fertilizer, that are dependent on natgas feedstock.  Nor that all natgas is substitutable for any application.  There are different chemical compositions that are better or worse suited for different applications and a key problem is imbalance in supply of different mixtures. Given that the two largest cost inputs for agricultural production are diesel and fertilizer, this has the potential to be a slow motion car wreck through the economy.

            It‚Äôs a shame that nearly all of the Solvay process coke ovens have been shut down with great prejudice. I admit that the smell of phenols and sulfur are pretty stiff around any of those places, but they‚Äôre always in the old and largely uninhabited part of town anyhow.There‚Äôs lots of ammonia collected in the process of coking metallurgical coal. Since it can be turned into fertilizer production, I can see why the Govenment and PTB don‚Äôt want any of that stuff. Their cabals can make more money forcing the use of Natural Gas as a feedstock, and if they make more money selling it to someone else while we starve, then more the better for them.

Mining is the ultimate foundation of industrial tech and energy; if the cave  tunnels are to be our ultimate redoubt, resources our key chokepoint, then I know where I can go find work, start making contacts with an eye to organizing.
The rough-n-readys of the mines, oilfields, and their supply warehousers are /ourguys/, the technicals are too, and I can get in as a worker.  Heck, I know some mining people already.
Where is the time for a career networking while research- if I can‚Äôt find it, I‚Äôll make it.

        I think this is the year when somebody rolls the dice on something *really* stupid. Looking at the popular mood (insofar as one can judge these things) in the immediate run up to things like World War One and the Civil War, there‚Äôs a palpable sense of ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just get this over with.‚Äù It can‚Äôt go on like this, for whatever values of ‚Äúit‚Äù and ‚Äúthis.‚Äù So why not just push the button on (insert stupid scheme ‚Äì secession, whacking the Archduke, writing Austria-Hungary a blank check, whatever).For most people in the countries involved, the overwhelming feeling was hysterical relief. Finally!This being Clown World, of course, the precipitating event will be so much faker and gayer than anyone can imagine, but that goes without saying.

            And they got it ‚Äúgood and hard‚Äù as Mencken put it.  With rare exception, Spanish-American War as an example, wars rarely turn out the way the cheerleaders hope.

                They seem to be doing pretty well out of it thus far.
Your sons and brothers. Not so much.
Maybe one should think what the cheerleaders actually hope to get out of them, not what we project they want?

            As Bismarck used to say, that when ‚Äúit‚Äù comes ‚Äúit will be some damn thing in the Balkans‚Äù. As he also said, all of it ( Ukraine included) ‚Äúaren‚Äôy worth the bones of one Pomeranian Grenadier.‚Äù

            Used to think ‚ÄúThe Fourth Turning‚Äù guys were right up there with the evangelical ‚ÄúLeft Behind‚Äù novels.  That P. Turchin was clever but also a bit silly.
Not so sure anymore.
I‚Äôd expect there to be plenty of BLM/Antifa activity come the fall and the 2022 elections.  Plenty more if the Republican‚Äôs win, and now everything will once again be their fault.
This is a house divided.

                There won‚Äôt be any antifa activity.  The riots in 2020 were activated to make it look like the country was drowning in chaos and violence (and if you vote a change of leadership it will all go away!).Also the riots were set up as a trap for Trump.  If he lets them continue he looks weak.  If he tries to send in the Army, the traitor generals get to puff themselves up and self-righteously declare ‚ÄúNo sir, I will NOT order our troops to fire on peacefully protesting fellow Americans!‚ÄùIn such a case, even the Republicans would have ‚Äúregretfully‚Äù voted to impeach him.

                    That ‚Äú‚Ä¶drowning in chaos and violence‚Äù was excessively fake and gay, wasn‚Äôt it?
I mean, battle umbrellas?‚ÄúLet them eat Air Jordans?‚Äù
And then everybody went home to catch some sleep and come back the next night.
