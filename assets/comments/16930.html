        Minus what you saw on the tube, you could have been describing 90% of North America and 99% of Western Europe just 2 generations ago.  Did it really happen that quickly…

            It only takes one stupid generation.  The people who let them in here are checking out without really feeling what they’ve done.  Life is unfair.

        The top three immigrant groups in Finland are Russians, Estonians and Swedes.
I wish America had that immigrant influx.

            Spent a day in Helsinki several yrs ago and drove to Porvoo for lunch with another couple from the cruise ship we were on.  Our Finnish driver/tour guide, Johann, spoke perfect English.  He had a good sense of humor, too.  He would refer to “Russian time” or “Swedish time,” i. e. historic periods when Finland was ruled over by these two Baltic superpowers.  The Finns held their own throughout;-)  Advice to Zman: get a bunch of chocolate for gifts back home from Karl Fazer’s in downtown Helsinki.  Not far from the Marimekko store.  Wonderful spot!

        Water pressure is an issue across most of Europe. Primarily because the pipes are old, and often heavily lined with minerals (chalk) that reduces the interior dimension of the pipes. While annoying, it actually saved the Romans who settled in these parts from lead poisoning. It’s a typical issue for older hotels, but you shouldn’t run into it in the newer ones.The key card for the room electricity master switch has nothing to do with the security chip in your room key. You’ll find them in more and more hotels across Europe. Actually, any card will work. I use an old luggage name tag that’s the same size as the room key which I always carry in my wallet when I travel. If you don’t have one, just take the key card with you when you leave and you can use it in any hotel you visit.I always to this when the room has air conditioning so I can keep the room cool during the day while away. European house keepers are very respecting of the ‘”Do not disturb” sign so you can leave the air conditioning running and the TV on so they think someone is there. An old, but effective trick.Water on the table is a regional thing. The French do it, the Italians do it, but not the Germans. Not because they can’t, but because they’d rather sell you a bottle of mineral water. It just depends on where you go, sort of like sweet tea in America; easy to find in the south, but not up north.You’ll find crime is generally quite low everywhere in Europe, at least in the West. Violent crime is limited to marginalized people as you say, But you’d only find yourself in those neighborhoods if you intentionally went looking for them. Train stations, especially main stations, are the most risky for petty theft and pickpockets everywhere. Tourist locations are also obvious spots for petty crime since the locals can spot a tourist a mile away. If you travel by train, keep a close eye on your bag and never leave it unattended. Also, never sit near the door either. Snatch and grab is a common trick just as the train is departing the station.Keep in mind, the minute you open your mouth everyone knows you’re not from there and these days, not everyone appreciates Americans. If asked or challenged about where you’re from, and you sense it might be an issue, tell them your Canadian. The Canadian’s haven’t upset anyone lately and Europeans can’t tell the difference between an American accent or a Canadian one.Safe travels!

        I’m Australian. I soldiered with a Finn. He was a dour man, and as you Anericans say, harder than woodpecker lips. That was 30+ years ago, but I still remember the air of unstoppable stoic determination that he had about him.
I would never want to fight the Finns. Apart from the weather, I think that’s another reason the vibrants have stayed away. The Finns don’t seem like they’d put up with Trucks of Peace etc for very long at all. And lots of them still carry the Puuko.

            What do you mean “soldiered with a Finn”? Were you in the Foreign Legion? But yeah, I wouldn’t want to mess with a guy whose homeland makes the coldest parts of hell comparable to a spring vacation. Aussies aren’t anything to sneeze at either, have to be to survive on that continent!

        And I believe the Finns are the most heavily armed people in Europe after the Swiss and if you don’t count all the AKs buried in gardens (just in case) in the Balkans.   Next door neighbor in college one year was a Finnish Iron Ranger named Eskola–still the only easy to pronounce Finnish name have ever run across.  All the Finns on campus somehow found each other and would congregate for marathon poker and drinking bouts during winter quarter–first time heard Finnish spoken, but yes a cross between Klingon and something a Bushman would speak is about right.  They all looked the same, only varying in height.  My wife who is the Northern varietal of Polack could probably blend in in a heartbeat.  Lord I hope the Finns don’t fuck it up.

Close enough: it’s the Swedes. And it’s not peashooters either, but ordnance designed to drop 1,600 lbs of elk, with all the bells and whistles, of course.

                    Bought a Tikka a couple months back. Took it to the range to figure out how to hit things at 300 yards and the range safety guy says, “That thing ought to be able to put rounds in the black all by itself.”

                        All those nice Finnish, high power, scoped beauties are great fun and useful hunting/sniper equipment.  But first obtain a reasonable AR-15 with a reasonable red dot scope (and BUIS).  Keep the rifle light.  Learn to shoot and scoot.  You should (it’s not hard) be able to repeatedly hit man-sized silhouette targets at 300-400 yards, regardless of your tired old eyes and generally declining upper body strength.Bullseye shooting from a bench is good sport and a rifle with 1 MOA accuracy a dream to behold—but all that’s needed in the future conflict is a rifle capable of 1 minute of “bad guy” and the ability to move before you are spotted.  You want to join in the fun, bring this ability to the party when invited.  😉

                            @Compsci– nah, ARF-15’s are barbies for boys. Toys. Wanna really reach out and touch something, get yourself a Barret M-82.  I’m jesting, but I got to fire my nephew’s last time I was in the States. Never got to use one in the service or after, just rifles. Lots of fun. The 82 is like driving a monster truck versus a Ferrari.

        Aside from a half-sensible government, Finland has two things keeping foreigners out: appalling weather and a fiendishly difficult language. While Sweden just throws its doors open, a lot of people come to the US and UK simply because that’s where they can best use their dozen words of English. Also, Finns are an odd bunch: Scandinavians agree on very little, but they all agree the Finns are weird. I rather like them though.Interesting you met an Italian. The one thing the Finns can’t do is food: they even manage to screw up German food. But I stumbled upon a small restaurant with about 5 tables run by an Italian, which at the time felt like Michelin star.The other thing I noticed about Helsinki was how few foreign logos and shop signs I saw (this was in 2012, perhaps things have changed), which ties in with your observations about homogeneity. I remember I couldn’t even find ATMs with the Visa and Mastercard symbols on. You’ll find the same in Tallinn I expect, with most foreign businesses being – you guessed it – Finnish.Finally, all hotels in Europe do that thing with the card to turn on the power. It’s fine for the lights but if you want to charge a laptop you need to use a second key or put in a library card or something.I’m looking forward to your experience of Tallinn.

        There are still lots of places in the U.S. that are not vibrantly diverse. It is rare enough to see a black around here that I often double-take to make sure I saw correctly. I am all in favor of packing them into a handful of cities and then walling them off.
Out of curiosity I was looking at Finland’s demographics and saw that there are almost 20,000 Somalis in Finland. They are everywhere. The whole country of Somalia is like an incubator for people who have no purpose other than being refugees soaking up benefits from other nations.

            The Somalis are favoured cultural enrichers by globalists because they are the most violent, superstitious, illiterate, fanatic and plain dysfunctional people they could find. They are the nobility of the immigration-industrial complex, the elite shock troops.

                Yeah over the Powerline blog they are discussing that Somali cop that shot the Australian woman. I was talking my shit about  Visgoth and Vandal blood singing in their Minnesota veins. No upvotes, and I likely give myself too much credit, but I swear I’ve almost got them whipped up into a Lynch Mob

                        I suspect Johnson is a good guy. He keeps calling out all those sociopathic New York Jew journalists  with a apparent hate and a poison pen. He never alludes to the fact that they are his co-religionist. I would estimate that a good 30% of the commenters over there are jewish.

        The English county (Cheshire) I live in has a population of just over 1 million, 98% white with the vibrancy congregated in only one or two places. Its easy to go through life with little contact other than perhaps the odd doctor or dentist with anyone who looks different than the English population of the last couple of thousand years. All tradesmen, carers, shop assistants etc are British white and yes…..it does make me feel comfortable.

            Ireland is exactly the same way, especially along the coastal regions. Very white, very safe, and the Irish are hysterically funny by nature. They’re also keen to have any Americans back who can prove they have an Irish mother, grandmother or great grandmother. Wonderful country.

        I like being in countries where I don’t understand the language. I don’t have to get involved in their politics or petty, local squabbles. It gives you a sense of freedom to stroll along and concentrate on the strangeness of everything. Food shopping is one of my favorite things to do in European countries. I’ll try anything once and it’s fun to buy things and take them back to your little kitchen for preparation. Good restaurants and bars are always a blast. When the locals spot you as a foreigner, the deluge of questions begins. And remember, Zman: passing up the chance to go to a great museum is like turning down an offer from a beautiful woman. If you do, you’ll regret it for the rest of your life.

        The cable TV point is interesting. CNN is recently clucking about how the advertisement on Tucker Carlson is a wasteland despite his record viewership. This speaks to the necessity of Boomercons to cut the cord, which they have failed to do. My Boomer parents are still subscribing to the local leftist dead tree media.
We may be led by monsters, but their followers are people that want to “sit back and grill”. The salvation of our civilizations is for the Right to deplatform the left by cancelling its subscriptions and its Big Social memberships.

            Subtly, occasionally,  but consistently, mention the cluelessness of the media to your friends and acquaintances.  Don’t do it to the extent that you are known as ‘that weirdo.’  Don’t foam at the mouth.  Quietly, unpolitically, mention how great it is to be unplugged.  Think happy thoughts out loud about the money you save.  Encourage your like-minded friends to do the same.  Ditto social media.Some people will take the hint; others won’t.BTW, this boomer cancelled print subscriptions five years ago and has been cable-free for two.

        There are the somewhat cherubic type, with a hint of north Asia to them.I think there’s some interesting and very ancient history that explains this observation.  As I understand it, Korean is a very unusual language that doesn’t share very much in common with any other Asian language.  It does share a lot in common however with Finnish.  Did some band of North Asian horseman find their way to populate similar climes in Finland/Norway/Sweden thousands of years ago?For what it’s worth I’ve always thought that before she got her work done Renee Zellweger had a slightly Asian cast.  One of her parents had Sami ancestry and the Samis seem to be some ancient tribe of horsemen:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1mi_people

        The Finns also obsess about energy usage. In the hotel, you have to insert your key card into a slot near the door to turn on the electric. Even the sockets power off when you remove the card.
This is a “feature” in many hotels in countries I have traveled in. It can be annoying when you want to leave some piece of gear charging while you are out. I’ve bypassed by simply leaving an extra key card in the slot.
I take it as more virtue-signaling than actual sound policy.

                    There has been a move, thanks to the EU, to standardize Euro plugs to a Type-C. It’s a flat, 2-pin plug which is becoming more and more common and works just about everywhere in Europe including Switzerland.Brits still have the most annoying plug, (and the largest) but you can easily defeat it by just taking the cap off a Bic pen and push the “leg” of the cap into the center interlock. There’s no power, it’s just a safety block. Then you can plug in a regular Type-C plug.What you may have trouble finding is an electrical outlet in bathrooms, especially newer ones. And for whatever reason, the Brits are terrified of electrical outlets, especially in bathrooms. If you can’t find the hair dryer, look in the desk drawer.https://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plugs-and-sockets/

        We have decided, based upon the commercials we see, that we will never have a luxury car, a home in a seriously upmarket neighborhood.  The good news is that we are both white and our kids are, too…  unlike the people that gather around breakfast and dinner tables in the commercials.  Asian mother, black father (sometimes of the same gender), and a weird assortment of kids..
We are content in our ordinariness…

        As a young engineer I took a business trip to Copenhagen; I will never forget the hotel shower I suffered through for 4 days: The water was a trickle that alternated between scalding hot and freezing cold, with a period of about one minute. So there was a time period of maybe 10 seconds/minute when you could actually stand under the water as it transitioned from one extreme to the other. I would have sworn it was done deliberately to prevent guests from actually using the shower.

        muslims have been arrested grooming and raping children in Oulu. The somalis invade the malls during the day and yell at each other which guessing passes for conversation.
The Finns for whatever reason continue trying to integrate these savages. Despite their best efforts these so-called migrants  / refugees always fail miserably. They speak very little Finnish or English, but the one word they all know is “racism”.

        “He figured out my politics, because he then told me how important it was for Finns to keep the Muslims and blacks out of the country. He also said their rulers were trying to change Finland by importing diversity, but he was confident the Finns would not lose their country…”Was this part wishful thinking or satire?  I simply can’t imagine a cabby saying something like that!The conservationist streak you describe seems like something that could only exist in homogenous societies where there is great altruism between individuals.  You can’t have that in a situation like we are in where everyone is blaming other groups for their problems and trying to scam one another.

        Passed through Helsinki airport, nothing more.  The efficiency and competency of Northern European airports is refreshing.  (With the exception of Brussels, which seemed like North Africa rather than the heart of the EU.)  To me, it’s embarrassing that many foreigner’s first step on U.S. soil is Newark airport.  It seems almost third world.I think visiting Europe several times may have changed my beliefs a bit — there is simply higher levels of what we all call social trust now which shows up everywhere.  Don’t know how long it will last, though — lots of virtual signaling Progs over there, too.

            Big cities are the same everywhere in the world. But at least in Europe, the smaller towns and villages are very safe. Every city has it’s blight, the trick is to avoid those places and find the beauty in the countryside around it.Paris is horrible, I haven’t been there in 30-years because it’s so dreadful. But Normandy and Brittany are a very different story. I spend a few weeks every summer in either Tuscany, Italy or the south of France. Some of my favorite cities are Orange, Valence, Avignon and of course the Dordogne. If you can get away off season, Cannes, Nice and Saint Tropez are the best kept secret in winter. Shhhhh…don’t tell anyone or they’ll all want to visit!

        Maybe I’ll install thermal sensors in every room…Thermal might work, motion sensors don’t; years back at Company X the facilities gurus went to motion sensing switches to “save energy” – everyone developed “arm swing twitches” because every 10 minutes your office went black unless the switch saw motion.FYI, especially with the advent of LEDs, energy consumed by lighting is pretty minor compared to what motors consume – cooling, heating, pumping, pressurizing, etc. are the big users. Flat screen TV energies are interesting, especially the older non-OLED ones – watt consumption is dependent upon what the screen is displaying – brighter is more, darker is less; I’ve seen mine go from 35-45 watts to &gt;200 on a scene change.

        Chabad is not a cult. It’s a missionary outpost of the Lubavitch Chasidim, and about as benign a religious organization as can be. It exists to provide religious services for non-affiliated Jews all over the world. They are very kind people who have no other interests than Judaism and charity. In my town, their primary outreach, besides Judaism, is to provide social services for mentally handicapped adults. Jared Kushner is a modern orthodox Jew who has nothing to do with the Lubavitch or Chabad.  If you find all this of little or no interest, I agree with you; the fascination of non-Jews with Jews continues to amaze me.

More people die than give birth there. You lot can posture all you want about IQ, but until you are able to answer and fix the fundamental question of how people in literal warzones manage to get their peckers up and women popping sons, then decline is inevitable.

                    I’d be willing to bet that at the present time, there are roughly twice as many Finns in Finland as there were in say 1840.  It was Finland back then, and it’s Finland now.  Populations go up and down; so long as the society is properly monkey-proofed, it doesn’t matter if the birth rate dips for a generation or two.  All you have to do is keep out the rape-apes and GloboShlomo.  We’ll see if the Finns are up to the task.The big problem in the current crisis is that the invaders arrive unarmed, carrying biological weapons known as children.  It’s much easier to shoot an armed invader.  I wonder, if the Nazis had invaded Russia each with a little papoose on their back, whining that all they wanted was a better life, would the Russians have shot back?And yes, we know there are Somali rape-apes in Finland.  We see them on YouTube, ooking about and robbing Finnish convenience stores.  Another job I guess the Finns won’t do.

                        Yep. Low birth rates fix themselves. People genetically predisposed to not wanting children die out of the gene pool. People genetically predisposed to wanting children take over the gene pool
Problem solved – IF you keep out invaders.

                    I always get a kick out of this argument: the solution to declining white fertility is to encourage net loss non-white immigration. It always calls to mind the old joke about the idiot businessman who, when confronted by his CPAs with a net loss on each widget he manufactured, told them to increase production so as to make up for his losses with volume.

You sit here in the Diaspora, not building up your homeland. You troll a people betrayed by their leaders, instead of being courageous and shaming your own people out of their anti-white racism.
Ireland didn’t sit on oil, and we were colonized several times longer by the British than you were.

                    Well I have 8 white kids so I picked up some of the slack. But the truth is that the blacks are the ones who are doomed. Once whites become too small of a majority to prop up the blacks and browns, they will start dying off by the tens or hundreds of millions in short order. Better start hoarding food now because the coming famine is going to be lit!

            I realize that you’ll catch a fair amount of shit for your comment here and below, but you make a reasonable point. By almost every measure Europeans and their disapora are laughably superior to Sub-Saharan Africans. I mean, we’re barely the same species. (Come to think about it, this is true of almost all non Sub-Saharan races/ethnicities.)We’ve managed to conquer space, unravel our DNA and created some of the most beautiful art and architecture the world has ever seen, while Africans before the arrival of Europeans were one step above chimps and, despite being given all of our knowledge, remain ever on the edge of returning to their neolithic squalor.Yet, amazingly, in this technological age created by Europeans, Africans’ primitive minds, their stunningly low IQ and inability to think past 10 minutes from now has become a huge evolutionary advantage.Africans are highly adapted to be European pets. Of course, that advantage relies on Europeans continuing to provide food and shelter, but as long as the gravy train continues, Africans will take advantage of it like no other race. Good for you.And, naturally, you have to wonder why Europeans would breed and fill their house with particularly low IQ, vicious pit bulls. We’re obviously not well adapted to this environment; ironically, an environment that we created.But this environment that Sub-Saharan Africans are so well suited is artificial and ephemeral (that means lasting a short time). Africans have found a wonderful niche as a parasite on Europeans, but those Europeans willing and able to host the African parasite are – as you correctly point out – dying out. In a few generations, either Europeans and their diaspora will be gone, in which case, Africans are screwed, or they will developed an immunity to the African parasite, in which case, Africans are screwed.So enjoy the golden age of the African parasite. It’s coming to an end.

                To be fair, the indigenous Native Americans were functioning at stone age level when the colonists arrived. The basic requirement for any functioning civilization is an alphabet, the wheel and knowledge of metal working.
And of course fire comes in handy too –

                    There was a small city known as Cahokia, in the St. Louis, MO region. It was the largest part of what was known as the Mississippian Mound Builder Culture. They collapsed during the 15th century IIRC, before colonization. Large amounts of human sacrifice occurred at Cahokia, which the school textbooks don’t mention. Lots of human sacrifice still occurs among Africans in St. Louis and East St Louis IL.

                    True. However, having lived around a fair number of American Indians, I can tell you that they don’t compare to Africans. Dumb, yes. Drunk, oh yeah. Prone to violence, yep. But American Indians can kind of, sort of, barely, function at the lowest level of society with a bit of watching over.
The only way to keep Africans from chimping out and destroying everything is a massive police state watching every minute of every day.

                Citizen, you seem to be drawing a picture of a gradual extinction.  Gradual is where we are *now*, but I fear that rate will exponentially increase as the percentage of non-whites increases above a critical mass point, or conversely, Whites dip below a critical mass.  At some point, the engine of the country, Whites, will fail to provide the “Danegeld”, i.e., welfare, to our vibrancy.  At that point I suspect we’ll be in for the fight of our lives.  The end of a distinctive category of population described as White might be very sudden and precipitous.

                    Possibly, or that critical mass of non-whites will awaken a latent tribalism in a fair number of whites, leading to serious push-back.
Hard to say which way it will go. However, I’m a pretty average guy, and I went from libtard cuckservative to wanting a white homeland over the past decade or so. And that was when the warning signs were fairly faint. They’re flashing now.
My point is that if Mr. Average here made the journey, you get bet there are a lot more like me coming around.
