        The big fiefdoms were the corporate behemoths of the 50s, 60s, and 70s.  The engineers were the serfs.  I worked for a bit with one of these guys whose every pore oozed yankee ingenuity.  He was the basic patent holder for two of technologies that are intrinsic to semiconductor packaging.  He never saw a dime for either, beside whatever bounty the conglomerate paid him (I seem to remember it was around $150 each) and the value of the plaques he got.The big companies mostly held the patents in reserve and pulled them out when a competitor gained some competitive advantage and threatened to upset the oligopoly.  You slowed the other guy down until you caught up or intimidated him into making some compromise so you could keep your share of the market pie.Now with IT pushing the cost of documenting and processing a patent down to next to nothing and big data allowing any simpleton of a lawyer to find, bend, spindle, and mutilate GBs of intellectual property documentation in a few milliseconds, it’s getting ugly.  Any perceived exponential growth eventually reaches some asymptotic limit (Moore’s Law is quietly being buried as I write).  Lawyers plus technology will always produce an s-curve of near-meaningless but very expensive legal activity.  When the legal eagles finish befouling this field, they will move on to the next growth opportunity and IP law will either transform (insert Hegelian dialectic here) or settle down into a stable energy band until the next crisis.
