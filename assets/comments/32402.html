        For months much of the world literally stopped going to work and yet the economy did not collapse. Everything we thought we knew about the workings of a modern economy said such a thing would plunge the world into a dark age, yet nothing changed all that much. Food got more expensive, but it somehow managed to get on the shelves.
All that proves is that most people are effectively useless.

            Yep, all the people I know working in jobs that keep the lights on didn’t miss a single day of work. New Jorkers though, they’re pretty much useless so them all locking down didn’t hurt much. Keep in mind the lockdowns were most strict in the blue states. Which goes to show just how useless they really are.

        I enjoy the Matrix and other Sci fi stories, but I’m 99% sure the World is real, and as we perceive it is also real, true the human senses only see a small spectrum of what’s possible, but that doesn’t make it all fake
BTW the great thing about the Matrix, is they only made one film, and resisted the urge to do any sequels, I admire that

                    the inability for an individual to discern reality is a definition of insanity.
when an entire culture can no longer discern reality …. well, there are historical examples.

                Yeah, I missed that (sarcasm).  Thanks.  Seems the “rule” applies, “Any popular and profitable film will continue to spawn more and more sequels until the last sequel loses money!”

                Yes. I made a comment here once that the UFO (or UAP if you prefer) thing is an attempt by the superbeings who have created the phenomenological world to apply local patches to tie up the loose ends. But I kinda wasn’t being serious. The truth is that this is a cope people who tend to unbelief employ to address the problem of God’s seeming indifference to human suffering. Just like our selective news media ignore the things they prefer not to talk about, these Believe in the Science people selectively ignore that this problem was solved two thousand years ago when Jesus suffered for us.You can choose to believe that there are ‘simulations all the way down’ or you can choose to believe in a Christian God. That is the real Great Divide, Zman. There have been attempts to undermine this transcendent truth since the beginnings of Christianity with a watered-down ‘social gospel’ but it cannot be entirely extinguished by our decadent age.I hesitate to post this because I’m a lackluster Christian at best — for example I haven’t taken communion in years — but there it is fwiw.

                    This, a perfect example of what I’m talkin’ bout.The short-circuit caused by monotheism.One will start out Merton and then go full Icke in the worst cases.By “short-circuit”, I mean the search for a Source, a First Mover, a magician outside the aquarium. Even ‘simulation’, like ‘intelligent design’, is a viewpoint and order centered around an alpha male. Its first axiom is that everything fell together all at once, rather than note by note. One of the questions is how to explain such a magical beginning.It’s natural, a part of primate neural processing. I get that, it works.I verified through disaster that no, the spiritual ecology doesn’t work like that; to see it so, as Mind, is an aspect of information processing at our level. That doesn’t matter, it doesn’t change the process of the ecology of the biosphere greenhouse. An organic formative and composting layer, a recycling and electromagnetic formative layer, building to a seeding layer as a node in a much larger cosmic skein and engine.It is our existence in a greenhouse, I say, that leaves us looking for the outside of the aquarium. After all, to exceed that greenhouse’s bounds is the why, the function, of the greenhouse’s formation.That is, to accomplish the Seeding. This must be why monotheistic thought and messianism are intertwined, that the face of function and direction satisfy a primate’s emotional question of the “Why”.

                        Frankly, I understood virtually nothing of that. It really gets back tochoosingwhat you believe.The genius of Christianity is that it does offer the believer a bit of relief from suffering. Whether Christianity is a cultural adaptation to a hardwired human need, I don’t know. No other religion offers this path though. (Maybe Buddhism to a lesser degree but on a more intellectual level which isn’t satisfying to most.)There is physical suffering and there is emotional suffering. Both can be either temporary or chronic. Temporary pain/suffering is an adaptive response necessary to life itself. Christianity doesn’t offer relief from that. Fortunately for us, biochemistry has addressed that problem to some extent. But biochemistry — or the marketing of biochemistry — has also led us down a false path to relieve chronic suffering, both physical and emotional, relying on drugs alone. This is self-evident.Now there is some evidence that a combination of psychotropic drugs plus therapy may relieve a lot of chronic emotional suffering as well. That’s all to the good. But for hundreds of years only Christianity promised to relieve that kind of suffering.That still leaves chronic physical suffering. Powerful non-addictive drugs may be developed that relieve that kind of suffering too. But then that raises the problem of gatekeeping. What kind of gatekeepers do we want? Ordained priests or licensed physicians?There’s another kind of suffering I haven’t mentioned because I’m not sure of how it differs from the emotional. I believe it does exist distinctly however and that’s spiritual suffering although maybe spiritual isn’t quite the right word. Maybe in the end that’s the only thing Christianity will be good for.. but it’s not a small thing.

                            I don’t buy therapy one bit.  To the extent talking with someone can alleviate suffering, we have friends and family.  We’ve been so atomized and isolated that people resort to a paid “friend.”

                            I call this vague spiritual suffering of today, materialist horror. I picked that up from Michel Houellebecq’s The Elementary Particles and although the guy is a typical French freak, he really nails the ennui in his descriptions of modern life.

                The part of the Matrix that makes the least sense is of course the whole “humans as bio-batteries” trope. It’s a brazen violation of the laws of physics (humansconsumeenergy, not generate it). What it did for the movies though, is provide a reason for the AIs to refrain from just slaughtering the humans. It’s too bad they didn’t put more thought into working out a reason for that.

                    Nah, it can work. It does violate the conservation of energy, but we break that all the time.  Coal and NG have double (or triple) the energy the electricity generated from coal and NG has.  Electricity is more convenient than coal or natural gas if we want to watch TV, for example. The majority of the energy is lost to waste heat in coal fired generating stations, though it can be better in a modern gas fired power plant.Humans can turn corn and other vegetation into usable energy.  Now, it would probably be more efficent to just burn it than to feed it to a human to somehow harness energy from the human, but it’s for the story.

                    The analogy works if you assume people can be split into two groups:
host and parasite. For parasites, the host works as a battery, even if the host has to find energy themselves through e.g. food.

                Amusingly enough in the Matrix most  people would actively fight the unplugged as indeed for them the Matrix is real.
Most people are better off assuming the cosmos is real. There is only a small minority that personally benefits from being able to unplug.
Those types are referred to the Meek and they are the human equivalent of black holes, i.e. complete rejection and destruction of the cosmos.

        The problem they have with pretending these things never happened is that some of the people they broke keep reminding everyone about them.  Hillary still runs around claiming Russia and Doug Mackey stole the election from her.  Once every few days you still see a lunatic wearing a mask in public sometimes even outdoors.I am really curious to see if they can keep this astroturfed enthusiasm for Kamala going through November.  Clips from her rally last night were comically bad, and the VP talk is all about finding a bland white guy to reassure whites it is ok to vote for her.

            Word is Kamala-lala-dingdong hasn’t even filed the paperwork to run. She’s smoke ( no pun intended) and a placeholder until the dem convention. The plan is to keep the pubs guessing and wasting money and foist their actual candidate upon us with little time left to expose him / her / it / them before November.

                “Now, all of a sudden, she is anointed as the favorite to win the November election. As with Obama, we are seeing a violation of rules that have been predictive for many generations. Perhaps what we are really seeing is one of those shortcuts used by the programmers.”No, all you are really seeing is more of the schemes and machinations of the Jews.  The reason that it all seems to keep getting crazier and crazier is that they keep consolidating more and more full-spectrum power; that, and their Operation Destroy America plan is gaining momentum as it rolls faster and faster downhill, like a giant snowball.

                        I’d be interested in hearing a rational analysis of how nearly all of America’s systemic problems don’t have a Jewish origin.  One that doesn’t involve paranoia and special pleading.  For instance, you do realize that the worse-than-worthless Obama was not some surreal historic aberration as the OP implies, but rather an entirely Jewish creation, a high-end version of that notorious Jewish creation, the weaponized negro.Armenians are market-dominant minorities too but they don’t mastermind the destruction of American cities and they don’t manipulate the government to start wars with Turkey.  As a result people don’t go around blaming their troubles on Armenians.  Jews cause every problem in the book, have their fingers in every god-damned pie, and then when someone rationally points this out, they shriek Anti-semitism!  Oh, sure, go ahead and blame the Jews!It’s like prying open a vampire’s coffin at high noon: watch how the vampire reacts: which proves, it’s a vampire.

                        I think it was only maybe a 1% chance initially, right up until Trump got shot. Then it went to maybe 25%. Once Brandon got overthrown, it went to 50%. The attempted assassination, followed by Brandon’s political assassination, pretty much removed the last trace of normality and lawfulness. At this point the US, politically, is an unstable Latin country with everyone trying to start their own death squad and revolution.Blue state ideologues usually think some group of hillbillies will kick off CW 2.0. It could just as easily be a bunch of ruling elite factions going “kinetic” on each other. I believe this is how the French Revolution worked out.

        Trying to manufacture reality only goes so far. Heels-up-Harris is even in the polls (only if you massively over sample Democrats). Ukraine is winning the war (Ghost of Kyiv). $35,000,000,000,000.00 in debt is not a problem as a % of GDP (only if you redefine the “P” in GDP). “You can avoid reality, but you cannot avoid the consequences of avoiding reality”.

        Remember Covid? Of course not, as it never happened, and only crazy people think otherwise.
I have met people in real life, who told me with straight faces that there were no covid lockdowns and that I am a conspiracy theorist if I think otherwise.
Then there is a second, slightly milder, group of retarded people, who claim that covid is ancient history and nobody cares anymore, so why don’t I just forget about it and move on…

            I know someone who told me that the idea that anyone lost their job for refusing the shot was nonsense and didn’t happen.  This same person also told me that there is no crisis at the border and it’s all made up by Fox News.

                As short a time ago as February, the Ministry of Plenty had issued a promise (a ‘categorical pledge’ were the official words) that there would be no reduction of the chocolate ration during 1984. Actually, as Winston was aware, the chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at the end of the present week.For the moment he had shut his ears to the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out of the telescreen. It appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank Big Brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week. And only yesterday, he reflected, it had been announced that the ration was to be REDUCED to twenty grammes a week. Was it possible that they could swallow that, after only twenty-four hours?Yes, they swallowed it. Parsons swallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal. The eyeless creature at the other table swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a furious desire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone who should suggest that last week the ration had been thirty grammes. Syme, too-in some more complex way, involving doublethink, Syme swallowed it.Was he, then, alone in the possession of a memory? — 1984, George Orwell

            I once went to a therapist to see if stress was the cause of my health problem. We had a conversation in which that did not seem to be an issue but I asked a general question out of curiosity. “how many of your clients are here because they fell down a rabbit hole of finding meaning from religions?” He told me it was the majority, most of which were lost in the eastern religions. I often wonder if it was the “challenging of your deepest fears and demons” that trapped them.Knowing yourself is a requirement to freedom but the resulting and dramatic lowering your opinion of yourself is a bitter (red v blue?) pill.

                LikeThe Matrix, The Truman Showis Gnostic heresy in movie form. Somebody, maybe Vigilant Citizen, made an in-depth study of the symbolism. Cristof is the Demiurge, and the Truman Show itself is the false ‘reality’ that imprisons the souls of Mankind (Truman=True Man) denying them spiritual enlightenment.Truman’s first real clue of his condition occurs when a light used to create the “stars” on the set falls, nearly striking him as he leaves for work. The light is clearly labeled “Sirius”– the Dog Star. Sirius is strongly linked to occult knowledge across multiple civilizations, and here it represents the sacred knowledge of the Divine that will allow Truman to escape his prison.Sirius pops up surprisingly often in our pop culture. Sirius radio, The Alan Parsons Project had a hit song called Sirius; somewhat obscure 70s band  Klaatu had a song called Dog Star. Everybody thinks Ozzy and his pals in Black Sabbath are the biggest Satanic band in rock, but they were lightweights next to Blue Oyster Cult. From their lyrics to their logo, BOC was absolutely soaking in occultism.  They make reference to Sirius as well in their song Astronomy:Call me Desdinova,The eternal Light,These gravely digs of mine,Will surely prove a sight,And don’t forget my dog,Fixed and consequent,Astronomy–A star!I mention all this to demonstrate how these Gnostic themes and ideas are hidden in plain sight.InThe Matrix, Neo is humanity trapped within a false construct just like Truman.Agent Smith is the Demiurge, or perhaps the Machines as a whole, but Neo follows the White Rabbit of occult knowledge to find liberation from his spiritual blindness. Its all very Promethean, or Lucifer/Sirius as Lightbringer, if you will.I’m working from memory here, but Vigilant Citizen established the premise pretty much beyond argument. See also Manly P. Hall for the esoteric teachings around Sirius and Saturn (BOC’s logo is a direct reference to Saturn, by the way).I’m not saying itstrue. I’m just sayingtheybelieve these things.

                        I consulted all the sagesI could find in Yellow Pages butThere aren’t many of them….And the Mayan panoramasOn my pyramid pajamas haven’tHelped my little brother…Maybe I called the BOC thing too soon. The Alan Parsons Project was possibly even more occultic; they were just much more quiet about it.Hard to miss the Oroboros on the Vulture Culture album cover once you understand what it means, and they had a song called Oroboros on their 2022 album called…you guessed it…From The New World. I would bet vast sums that the Eye In The Sky is a reference to the All-Seeing one peculiar to Osiris.Tell you ’bout a dream that I have every night,It’s on Dolby stereo but I never hear it rightEDIT: Actually just looked it up and yeah, it’s right there on the album cover so…herp-a-derp! My Google Fu is…weak.

                    Bloody excellent. Blackrock also directly refers to the Black Rock or Black Cube, themselves esoteric Saturn messaging.Many examples, from the tephilim on a rabbi’s head to the Kaaba in Mecca, or to the devil’s own equity fund itself.
For the unfamiliar, Saturn is Judaic, Apollo/Mercury is Aryan.

                            If you enjoy deep dives, I strongly recommend Salt Radio Ministries on YouTube.  Her website is gone but all her vids are there.  Brilliant, very well edited and researched and proof positive that these weird beliefs are threaded throughout the culture, from movies to TV to CERN to the UN.  This one is pertinent to today’s essay(CERN, the Simulation and Many Worlds)

        Speaking of Kamala Harris and her inexplicable rise, am I the only one who found it strange that as a childless woman at the age of 50 she marries Doug Emhoff? Probably one of her donors told her that if she had ambitions for higher office she had to have a spouse. OK, but why Emhoff? What’s in it for him? He’s a previously marries, affluent entertainment lawyer in L.A. who presumably could have his pick of younger, more attractive, not to mention more pleasant women. Was he offered some kind of deal, e.g. he could cheat as he pleased, so long as he showed up for fundraising events and the like?

When I’ve heard him speak he sounds to me like a homo trying to sound masculine. There’s a shakiness in his voice as if he’s trying to suppress something. Could just be my imagination.

I disagree. The first question is always “So, what do you see in this guy/this gal?” Watch if they equivocate in their answer. 😏
Whether this is a beard situation or not, marriages of convenience probably date back to the age of the Pharaohs. He’s getting SOMETHING out of this we aren’t seeing, money slushing in, access to power, etc.

            A new royal tradition. American politicians (and their families) are increasingly marrying their “minders.” The lucky ones get a dragon-lady spy, but typically it’s just some Jew. Public-image marriages—Obama wearing Mike as blackface, the Weiner/Abedin Abraham Accord, etc.—are on the way out, as the public is more openly defied/ruled.Vance shows typical GOP clumsiness. On the traditional PR side his marriage signals “outbreeder” against his obvious faggotry—but also he’s submitting to a race designated for rule,à lathe Biden kids all marrying Jews. So he disgusts everybody but it’s on an instinctive level they can’t or aren’t allowed to explain, so they make stuff up.

            I would guess that maybe 30% of “marriages” among the rich and famous are totally fake and were created purely for careerist or political reasons. It’s not a new phenomenon. European royalty used to marry just to cement alliances between nations.

        Rather than a simulation, I tend to attribute the events mentioned in Z-man’s post to the influence of television–the human mind has not evolved to distinguish the ‘reality’ seen on television from the reality of everyday life.  Add in the demographic changes in the US population and you have a reasonably good explanation for present events.

            Beat me to it, except I would add that the influence of television is waning that’s why everything seems so obviously contrived and fake.

                    The smallest screen, your cell phone, has pushed its way into competition for the TV screen, where you can now see things like blacks fighting and twerking, Israelis destroying Gaza, and the WWII history you never learned previously.

            Close, but “television” simply is shorthand for an overabundance of information and a limited ability to process it. This can be exploited, and it most certainly is, but can it be managed? I suspect not. Even the propagandists themselves lose the plot as The Next Big Thing sprouts up and people including them forget about The Last Big Thing. Fearmongers and strategists, to the degree they differ, dwell on the perils of EMP’s, but the idea they would limit the availability of information is in small part based on the false premise that what is available now is fully utilized. It is not and could not be. Yes, an EMP would be catastrophic as far as finance, travel, and so forth, but it also would reveal the great mental damage of trying futilely to process all the information that bombards our sensory perceptions constantly. Reality indeed does not go away when you no longer believe in it, but how can it be perceived amid the noises and flashes?

“We’re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you’re studying that reality — judiciously, as you will — we’ll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that’s how things will sort out. We’re history’s actors . . . and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.” Karl Rove

                “The interactions with the Mandela Effect, which is quite real,…”I watched Billy Graham’s funeral on TV in early spring of 2007. Nothing will shake this very clear memory. I absolutely, unequivocally saw it.Then Billy Graham died in 2018. Again. Pretty sure Christopher Loyd pulled the same trick; he was dead for awhile (Blockbuster tears!) but he is currently back. By popular demand, no doubt.My personal theory is that “They” (Dum-Dum-DUUUUUM!) are running experiemnts to see just how thoroughly their media tentacles control the things people “know”.Covid was another test.I’d say they’re running at better than 98% Efficacy now.

            I’ve always found that a quite penetrating observation. What he’s referring to is that nobody is able to see the future, no matter your academic credentials or your years of experience as a reporter. To be a stateman you must be able to act in the dark, without the light that hindsight gives you. Once you’ve acted, it’s the academics’ job to come in and explain why you did it, why you won or why you failed.
It ties in to the other Rove quote about known unknowns and unknown unknowns. Statesmen must be able to navigate unknown unknowns.

        A very interesting essay. However, rather than explain away The Great Derangement as a grand simulation on the fritz, my explanation is that the West–which basically rules humanity–sometime in the second half of the 1960s, succumbed to the irrationalist philosophy known as poststructuralism or postmodernism. Postmodernist philosophers, almost all of them explicitly anti-white racists, set about thoroughly undermining the epistemological precepts of Western civilization, which, in turn, allowed for what we often call the Satanic Inversion. Poststructuralism is effectively intellectual Satanism. And we are now living in its corresponding Hell where nothing makes sense.

                Being a born atheist- I can’t imagine Someone In Charge, nor the need for any such thing, I see only process- that statement was why I disagreed with our good David C. Wright long ago.
It made no sense to me.  It still strikes me as some jew shouting, “Believe in our god or else!!”
But, I see the sense of it now.  To center oneself around an alpha male is the deepest of primate instinct, of social organization.  To ignore what we are- primates, that is- and our troupe loses all sense of direction.

            I look at one possibility as being a little like the broadcast spectrum. We may have different realities coexisting at the same time in the same space. We may be on Channel 6, while other realities may exist on Channels 4, 10, 28, 34 and 53. (Those are the major channels in my area.)

                I have thought of that before too. It is all very interestingYet what I have found is the only plausible way to eternity is to have children.  At least some piece of you goes on forever.  And if it were meant to be any other way, then I doubt we’d be programmed to breed.Another issue I take with the simulation talk, and this is more of a necessary observation that should be at least in the forefront of the conversation, is that man is always using tech to explain existence and man himself.  In the early 20th century it was robots, for example.  Then electricity, a la Frankenstein.  Ghost in the machine, etc.  Now it is computers.  Yet I dont think computers make for a great analog only because, yes the mind and instincts may be “hardwired” into us, and CPUs provide a reasonable analog for that, but then we have the software side.  It’s not like we can plug in new software to change the way we think.  An old man cannot get a software update and then start thinking like a 20 year old.But more important imo is that whoever made us did so millions of years ago.  Not a computer in sight for a seeming eternity.  So that makes us about as low tech as you can get.  And which begs all sorts of additional questions.

        The real power structures in the West are: the Security Services, Intel people, various permanent bureaucrats who like in Patrick McGoohan’s “the Prisoner” converged with the Soviet model (the in-show riddle was that his character could not figure out if he was being held by his own government or the Soviets and concluded it did not matter).They are falling apart in the chaos they have themselves instigated through mass third world immigration and personal immiseration via neo-feudalism. No one is inspired by the rainbow dildo, nor drag queen story hour. Still less by having random muslims stabbing White girls and women to death every week. While they get poorer and poorer every day.TV is a gay/female ghetto, Star Wars is for black lesbian space witches (not kidding either), and it is coming up against in its ability to make people feel, and act, very hard limits as a result of its gay/female ghettoization. Mass media is literally for black lesbians now. Not a joke, look at broadcast TV or big cable shows. Amazon’s “Rings of Power” S2 will feature “a hot romance” (no, not kidding) between Sauron and “Guy-ladriel.” With lots of Alphabet + stuff as well. Innate disgust reflex engaged.Harris is falling predictably apart, the Trump Assassination attempt is now focused on how coordinated it was with the Secret Service and the firm with ties to Hunter that shorted Truth Social a day before the attempt. Whitmer and the North Carolina guy both have refused to be Harris’s VP, which is telling.Even the Intel/Color Revolution/FBI people have to produce results. Now dudes with money and power looking at Oct 7 and the Intel/Color Revolution/FBI people’s reaction to the Hamasistan reaction in the US are figuring the OMB is their best bet. How inept do the string pullers have to be to convert Elon Musk and Jaime Dimon and Bill Ackman to MAGA?

            No one is inspired by the rainbow dildohere’s a quote I am really picking out almost at random from Livys war with Hannibal. The context really is not important:Thus a great deal of money was made out of these cattle,  and from the profits a column of solid gold was dedicated to the goddess (Juno).is there anything that could be done like this in America that the people would all say with pride, that’s us, thats a symbol of us? Or even in a small town, every nook and cranny of the west is under the supervision of diversity and diversity could flood that town at any time. So there is nothing permanent that could represent “a people”.ive been playing around with this but im becoming convinced America is not a country. I don’t know what it is, it’s certainly an empire. But the principles of this thing called America are anti anthropological.humans come in make and female, and the come in a race. You don’t have like a blank human. But America says that that man or woman or a certain race has no place here we are a place for individuals with no ability to identify with anything g beyond that.it’s not human.

        The Trump administration (simulation) was the canary in the coal mine. There are too many bugs in this society at every level: bureaucratic, military, political establishment, entertainment, religious institutions, educational, and medical. It can’t be fixed as a whole. Any short term reforms in one sector will soon be overwhelmed and wiped out within a matter of a few years. I was listening to David Freiheit just recently, and I believe he was right. The wheels have to come off and then the areas that are willing to do what is necessary for their freedom will emerge from the red state territories. And there will be a heavy price to pay.

        Why fret over macro-issues over which you have no influence? At best, this creates anxiety and at worst, despair. Neither of those enhance your life. Better is to focus your time and energy on becoming robust such that you may weather the coming storm (whenever it arrives) and thereby persevere to live another day. There will come a time when each of us can make a difference. Know what you will do when that time comes. Make that your lodestar.

            i tend to agree.  especially when accounting for infinity.  men are not mentally capable to perceive the “secrets of the universe” by design.  if man had access to the information requested, the infinity of the universe would be at stake.  at least this way, we are limited to one world of seclusion for containment purposes.further, i lean toward the idea of “man creator”,  not in god like quality’s, but in his image.   any man is capable of creating his own reality.  the plasticity of the mind allows for any configuration.  it becomes even more interesting when considering the thoughts of one man and the infinite other thoughts that occurred or could have occurred at that identical time.  gives me reason to suspect the purpose is for higher learning, to inject infinite scenarios.religiously, two plans were presented.  every soul would be saved by force, the other freedom of choice.  freedom plan is complimentary to purpose driven higher learning and the inevitable failure.

                    sure.  the level of creating reality is not as important as the act of doing so.  the sub-Saharan may pray for rain and …. eventually it rains. this supports prayer.    the process comes into play as well.  a westerner may find it silly to pray for rain, because the westerner is aware of drought.  the westerner has moved on from praying for rain and plans to build dams to store water for droughts, displacing the sub-Saharan people.   paying no mind to the culture lost or wisdom gained.  the reality is constantly evolving for every individual with limitations.  i believe man has done well to curb nature, but failed in the humanity aspect.  the sub-Saharan may have some wisdom of humanity for the westerner.  the best i can tell the real problem lies with how we visualize and interact with each other, this is the purpose i refer to for higher learning in gods freedom plan.on the infinity scale we know the chance of existence for sub-Saharan and all mankind is near nil.  yet we consistently kill each other off like we don’t know what we are doing.  mankind suffers from cognitive dissonance.  purposefully failing to recognize the cosmic treasure of each and every soul on earth.  yes, man has made strides in humanity but always reverts to his natural state of incivility, killing each other, only to begin the process of civility again.this is the dilemma.  thinking its like finding the cure for mankind short of  enslavement and without polluting the infinite creation.   the purpose of existence is to contribute to the humanity of mankind, until a cure is found.

                    Somebody web just pondered that Guatemalans or Ethiopians won’t go to heaven as Guatemalans or Ethiopians, will they? The Christians assume they’ll be remade, recast, as having different qualities from what they are now.
Conversely, thinkers like pie also speculate that the Universe needs to know what it’s like to be a broken-down addicted bum in a cardboard box, just as much as being a king, seeing a Universal Mind that records all information, all modes of existence.

                        i will not speculate who meets the requirement for entry to heaven.  i do want to point out the fact that the broken-down addicted bum in a cardboard box is a cosmic treasure, just as the king.  this is a proven fact.  we walk around like we don’t know any better.  there is no end to the universe, with barely a glimmer of anything living as far we have ventured.  how many light years must we travel to find another broken-down addicted bum in a cardboard box?  don’t get me wrong, I’m not some bleeding heart, just a realist of sorts.

        Whoever wrote the base code had a sense of humor. Most of us have empathy and could very happily live peacefully within our respective tribes. But some of our simulated people have a sociopathic desire for power and take great pleasure in ruling and or destroying others.

        This simulation stuff kind of ties into your discussion of atheists yesterday.  I think you hear a lot about it today because it’s kind of a pseudo-religion that’s palatable to the same ‘spergies that tend to be loudly atheistic.  They wouldn’t be caught dead saying something positive about people who believe in Long-Bearded Sky Man, but they’re willing to believe and seriously boost the idea that they’re just non-material playthings of some otherworldly superbeings.  The fact that they themselves are believing in adifferentkind of Sky Man is lost on them.The physics/math ‘spergs are particularly susceptible to this stuff because they’re convinced their big brains understand it all.  Your cosmological theory doesn’t quite conform to observations.  That doesn’t mean that maybe there’s something you don’t quite understand.  It just means that 80+% of the universe is made up of some kind of invisible, non-reactive matter that’s impossible to detect!  The anthropic principle is a particularly silly thing the scientism-ists are fond of.  Your theories don’t really explain anything about why particular things have the numerical properties they do and in fact predict that these numerical properties could be just about anything.  Do you pause to consider once again that maybe you’re just missing something or lacking in hard data?  No!  The values you see in nature are necessary because otherwise the universe wouldn’t have evolved my big brain to understand everything!

            Well the anthropic principle is really just that we only have a sample size of one observable universe.  Like folks saying God must exist because electrons have just the right amount of charge for molecules to work, but we don’t have any examples of bad universes where the physical constants are different so we can’t really say whether or not the physical constants never vary, are totally random, or God tuned it.

                So you’re a physicist and you make up some overly complicated convoluted theory that not only doesn’t predict anything new that hasn’t been know for 100 years but also requires scores and scores of parameters that you just have to make up values for because they can’t be measured in any way.  If you futz and f@rt around making up a bunch of values for them, you can get something that kind of makes the same predictions as the accurate standard physics model that has been in use for 50+ years now.  When someone asks you what possible meaning all these numbers you made up have, your response is that the numbers have to be the ones you made up because if they weren’t then the universe wouldn’t exist for you to make them up!  The whole thing is pure solipsism – “Things are the way they are, because I’m here to tell you that’s the way they are!” – and completely unscientific.

                Also, ploppy, forget not the unstated axiom that all those physical constants had to happen or fall into placeall at once.I say no, there have been unguessable cycles of Creation, of the Big Diesel, each one proving and adding another physical constant, like a note in a symphony. The constants that didn’t prove didn’t pass to the next Cycle.I heard from a thermodynamics guy that he felt the beginning of the beginning was when all was forces, without form; then a tiny whirlpool formed, just as gravity is actually a whirlpool of time dilation, one “end” infitesimally slower than the other, causing form; matter and energy separated out of the same coin, each working against the other to cause further whirlpools of formation.(The “branes” conjecture of gravity is that gravity is a force from outside the universe, an echo of the simulation or God model.)

        The craziness is more basic than all this simulation nonsense:  The rules and laws no longer apply to the elites, so they can do and say what they want:2015:  The constitution says two dudes can marry.  Bruce Jenner is a girl.Trayvon Martin was a winsome teen out to buy skittles.  What are you going to do about it?2020:  George Floyd was murdered.  So was the Jogger.  Covid will kill ya’.  Vaccines are safe.  Ashli Babbitt was an insurrectionist.  Joe Biden won the election.  What are you going to do about it?2024:  Donald Trump is guilty of 100 felonies.  Joe Biden is an honest hard working man, Kamala Harris is kind, smart and popular, Ukraine is going to WIN!  What are you going to do about it?The non-elites are trapped by the digital surveillance state, the police (paid by the elites) and a mortgage.  All we can do is go along for the ride.

            We could do what Mr man has proposed many times: drop out. Certainly stop voting But I wonder if there is more that could (not) be done. The fantasy that whites are somehow a part of this would begin to crumble.I guess I do it by saying I’m not really a citizen of this country and proposing a secession in certain interactions.i also suggest to others that the us is really not a country at all certainly not a nation, because there needs to be some homogeneous aspect to it. The definition of the modern us is that there is only individuals cooped up together. You can’t say diversity is our anything because diversity screws up the definition of the word “our”.undermine the very existence of the us as a real thing and mock it.or not things are just gonna have to play out

            Ukraine is going to WIN!
The other examples you give do apply, but this one is just wishful thinking.  On the others, the elites control the outcomes, so they can manipulate as they see fit.  On Ukraine, a just as powerful outside entity has a huge say so in the outcome.  When Ukies lose, the resort will be to gaslighting and memory holing (What war in Ukraine?  What are you talking about, we always said it was lost cause?).

        “This idea is not new. In fact, it may be one of our oldest weird ideas, if you think of Plato’s allegory of the cave as a stab at simulation theory.”
All of Western philosophy is just a series of footnotes on Plato.﻿–Alfred North Whitehead

        ” I have known many gods. He who denies them is as blind as he trusts them too deeply. I seek not death. It may be the blackness averred by the Nemedian skeptics, or Crom’s realm of ice and cloud, or the snowy plains and vaulted halls of the Nordheimer’s Valhalla. I know not, nor do I care. Let me live deep while I live. . .Let the teachers and priests and philosophers brood over questions of reality and illusion. I know this: if life is illusion, then I am no less an illusion, and being thus, the illusion is real to me. I live, I burn with life, I love, I slay, and am content. “Conan The Barbarian

        “The Covid event is rather good evidence of one of those systemic shortcuts that point to this being a simulation. For months much of the world literally stopped going to work and yet the economy did not collapse.”
This did not prove the world was a simulation, it only proved that the managerial class was not necessary. Or in the parlance of the time, essential.

        The simulation hypothesis is fun but I think the more realistic explanation of people being NPCs is that brains only evolve as complex as is adaptive to the environment so the most well-adapted humans are only intelligent enough to be able to function in society without thinking about anything in depth.  High IQ is just an individually maladaptive mutation that keeps popping up because it benefits the group occasionally with a Newton or a Mozart.

        The “rules” don’t make sense because the game is different now.Your “rules” make sense in a majority white society, with Anglo-Saxon Christian morality, and an IQ average of 100.Society is now no longer majority white. Culturally it is even further from what it used to be than brown Christian countries are today. Morally, it is the opposite of a Christian nation, at least at the elite levels.The game has changed and nobody knows how it will play out. But it might not make sense that Kamala is in first place to YOU , but look at America. It is a mostly brown country.

            So very this.  Country’s populace is low iq, brain addled from porn, media, and drugs.  Increasingly non-white who are just waiting to stick it to whites because of (not inspite of) endless welfare and open borders.  They will wear America as a skinsuit then discard it eventually for their true skins.  They hated us when they were minorities and will hate whites still when whites are a minority.At the top are soulless globalist who only care about dollars and cents in their pocket and are willing to play every machivelian game that exists, tell any lie, perpetrate any hoax or atrocity.  Every lever of power is firmly held.Mustnt forget the  vindictive female functionaries of the elite who will crucify anyone with a wrong thought.  Trump just today had to grovel before a hostile POC woman at some POC organization to prove he’s not racist, which they will not ever accept.  Do these POCs or leftwing freaks ever come to us for approval?  Do we have any organization other than internet comments?Kamala winning (cheating or not) would not be terribly surprising.

        The Trump “disappearing assassination” psyop is real, and you all should be very, very concerned about it. Give it another month and you’ll be able to talk to people who’ll deny it to your face, and you’ll be off to the conflict races.Whether this is a simulation or not, it should now be clear to any man of this time with adequate intelligence that he and his family are in danger in the years ahead. It will take some time before all of this technology is flushed out of human life, by hook or by crook. Most people simply have no resistance to it; it is indeed a smallpox blanket.The fella’ at the Woodpile Report — RIP several years now — had it right. Really, really right.

        Often overlooked as a reason for all of this speculation is the idea that the human brain, beliefs, and “what we know to be true” are much more elastic and open for manipulation than most people are aware of.  The trickery, from within one’s own head, and from the outside, is pervasive and never ends.  The mind bending from outside is getting ever more targeted and more capably done.The trick is to constantly check your own thinking, and also everything you see and hear.  Don’t let the questioning push you into paralysis, but be careful to blindly accept that anything you think of or witness is true (For example, did the Venezuelan opposition really score a 70% victory?  On the surface, it seems likely to be true.  But is it?).There are a ton of vested interests that are not inclined to let you know how plastic your own thinking, or that of your neighbors, actually is.  Instead, they want to exploit that plasticity without you being aware of it.  Train your brain to be aware of it, and guard it against both their manipulations and your own stray thoughts and ideas.

        Hypnosis is realTV announcers/anchors all speak with a nearly identical cadence/rhythm which would be considered odd if used in normal everyday conversationPeople who watch a lot of TV tend to believe the messages thereby propagatedConclusion: There is some kind of mass hypnosis going on. No doubt there is a visual aspect to it as well as the stated auditory one.Changing the subject: Now that we know the economy doesn’t work like we’d been taught it does, and that many jobs are really just fake makework jobs which produce nothing but emails, what about the stock market? What if it’s as fake as the “real” economy? After a century or more of practice, perhaps they are much better at faking it than they used to be. How would we know the difference? What if the share price of AAPL or NVDA was supported by direct injections of “money” from the central bank? If this was what they wished to do, who could stop them? Or even know?

            Remember the “Plunge Protection Team?” Turned out, it’s real. Having said that, the reason stocks like AAPL and NVDA trade at such elevated levels is due to several factors. For one thing, the need for liquidity among the big index funds who manage everyone’s 401Ks and retirement savings. There are only a few companies that can offer the market caps needed for this. Also, the few real investing opportunities anymore for that size of company means they do stock buybacks. Those mega tech giants that can do stock buybacks with their hoards of cash win out and and it becomes a crowded trade, i.e. elevated prices. The smaller companies in the “value” pool were never able to borrow at the same near zero interest rates that the big tech companies were. This almost unlimited borrowing ability by the big tech companies is the reason they can do stock buybacks. What it boils down to is the finance markets today operate structurally in a different way than how finance capitalism was supposed to work back in the day. (But you’re a smart guy, I know you knew all that, I’m just writing something to a screen.)

                No, thank you, that’s a fine example of why capital accumulation without bounds will turn its efforts to tipping the game table instead of seeking a better mousetrap.  That’s the same question as a government unencumbered by a higher authority.

That is not just a hypothesis, that is literally true.  A lot of mental illness, like schizophrenia, is the result of people who due to a brain disorder, lack the necessary filters and limiting interface to screen out the parts of reality which are not relevant to their need to navigate their situation in a healthy or normative way.

            Immanuel Kant laid this out 250 years ago in hisCritique of Pure Reason. It’s become almost a cliche today but how did some guy figure this out initially?

                What amazes me is how we, our people and their direct ancestors, were to do this again and again, remembering and rebuilding using the shards of our shattered civilizations, as a response to unimaginable catastrophes, monotheism being the latest.
What terrifies me is that so much of our way of knowing is being lost, what thrills me is that we are recovering so much of it.   In our blood and bones, we stillremember.

            I’m pretty sure it’s a different plot, but I recall an amusing short story, title and author forgotten. Brief plot summary: Man manages an office building. One day someone comes and wants to lease the 13th floor. There’s only one problem, the building doesn’thavea 13th floor. Yet the would-be lessor persists. Finally, the manager is convinced somehow into drawing up a lease for the 13th floor, which the new tenant signs. (Perhaps he sees an easy opportunity to make some money off an obvious lunatic is the – wait for it – lessor of two evils. )Mr. Manager is bemused as the new tenant enters the elevator, goes up and vanishes for entire work days, leaving at the end of the day. The manager attempts to discover where he’s gone, but never can. Finally he finds a way: the tenant plans to vacate, and the manager notes by the terms of the lease, that landlord has the right to inspect the premises. Sure enough, he enters the elevator, and there’s a button “13” which he presses, and he exits onto the thirteenth floor, but ends up trapped there, because it doesn’t exist.

                As an aside, many Chicago highrises do not have a nominal thirteenth floor. They skip from twelve to fourteen. I am posting from a tall building which does not have floor thirteen, say what you will about superstition. And so there is that.

                Ben.  Reminds me of a cute movie worth seeing, “Being John Malkovich”.
A 1999 film directed by Spike Jonze and written by Charlie Kaufman. The plot follows Craig Schwartz, a struggling puppeteer who takes a job as a file clerk. One day, he discovers a hidden door in his office that leads into the mind of actor John Malkovich. For 15 minutes, Craig can experience life as Malkovich before being ejected onto the side of the New Jersey Turnpike…
Totally bizarre, but an interesting flick.  Worth streaming.

        As an undergraduate, I took a summer Philosophy course at Villanova and we read as part of the course Summa contra Gentiles (St. Thomas Aquinas).  In it, he demonstrates the existence of God while simultaneously discussing the opposing arguments.  I’m not a theologian, but that course and that particular book stuck with me over the years as my mental armor supporting my faith in God.Much as I’ve grown to distrust the modern Catholic Church (big C) for obvious and very temporal reasons, I have not abandoned my basic Christian faith.  I have struggled to find expression in a world that has monetized it to death and transmogrified it into an unrecognizable social justice political weapon.If you’re looking for a model to argue whether we live in a giant computer simulation, I would recommend a spin through Summa contra Gentiles (https://isidore.co/aquinas/ContraGentiles1.htm#11).  There’s nothing Z writes about today that Aquinas doesn’t discuss.The giant computer simulation argument is not new.  The concept has merely been updated to today’s technological terminology.  But the idea is very old.I reject the giant computer simulation because it assumes that the simulation is being actively controlled by “someone”, but if the simulation is always being patched and updated due to bugs and faults, then that “someone” is ALSO changing along with the simulation.  You haven’t reached perfection yet, and so you have not reached God.The computer simulation idea is a cheatintended to distract us from working towards God…to cut corners for ourselves rather than aspire to reach the astounding heights of God.  In effect, the computer simulation concept is an attempt to make God a little more like us because we are lazy and imperfect and why not just cheat a bit?  It is completely backwards.Godseemsindifferent to the suffering of Man because Man is indifferent to the Will of God.  He has made this quite clear on many occasions.  He even gave us a simple list of rules to follow and yet we complain, “But, but, but, I had a good reason for that!”One last point.  We are told that God created Man in His image.  But is that meant to be taken literally?  Almost none of the stories in the Bible are, outside the historical events.  Have you ever noticed how our maps of the stars and galaxies in the universe – the superstructures – look a lot like the neurons and connective pathways of our brains?  You would not be alone in noticing this.I’ve always found it fascinating.  Almost like some perfect being created our brains to look just so.  To look like God so we could think about Him and aspire to be more than our fat, lazy, imperfect, selves.

            I’m like you. I left the Catholic church (and several protestant ones) but didn’t leave Jesus. However, I have no belief whatsoever that God intervenes in his creation. All around I see evil men prospering and good people being martyred. As for your statement “Godseemsindifferent to the suffering of Man because Man is indifferent to the Will of God”, I’m not convinced. Many people are good and ARE aware of the will of God, yet God does still not intervene to help them when they are suffering. I guess this makes me all a Deist rather than a Christian.

        We are all a bunch of separate consciousnesses piloting fairly long-lived extremely complex meat robots through a shared reality. Whether you want to attribute this experience to God or the Great Programmer makes very little difference at the end of the day, doesn’t it? It could actually very well be both simultaneously and it would not alter the belief system of either group whatsoever. God CAN be a programmer too, and visa-versa.You are trapped in this place same as me and everyone else. So the delineation between creators is totally meaningless &amp; arbitrary. We have not figured out anyway to break the barrier of reality or even really bend it much, so until that happens there is little distinction. I’m not up nights about it as the “big reveal” will happen upon my expiration. Religion does not have all the answers, but neither does science. Go find a very religious and very scientific person and say to this them and you will get a similar negative reaction in both cases which is the part I find comical. The faithful will always push back against the man who knows that he doesn’t really know anything and doesn’t claim to.

        “For months much of the world literally stopped going to work and yet the economy did not collapse. Everything we thought we knew about the workings of a modern economy said such a thing would plunge the world into a dark age,”I guess I’m not smart enough (or dumb enough) to contemplate (un)living in a simulation.  The example above seems not convincing.  The world did *not* stop working—not my world anyway.  There were many, many “exempt” categories of workers.  Many more worked from home. Never were “jobs of the mind” therefore affected.   Meanwhile the government simply sent out checks to everyone for thousands of dollars—tax free, while at the same time suspending these same folk from paying their rents and other bills.Yes, schools were suspended, or forced to go online, but really how long has it been that we here have been discussing that schools teach little to nothing, and students learn little to nothing in the best of times.  Store shelves empty, yes, but that had little to do with weirdness in the economy, but rather folks buying everything and anything they could—“just in case”.  Such artificial shortages are easily predicted in a well run economy.  They happen before natural disasters and such all-the-time.  Toilet paper manufactures simply took a couple of months to catch up (with their “exempt employees”) while their product was rationed.All the “after effects” of the scamdemic were predictable and many even discussed in this group *before* they occurred.  Never did I hear we’d plunge into a “dark age”, but rather more like what we are experiencing now.  Two of the most important—and predicted—effects: inflation and unknown vaccine effects leading to deaths in excess of disease mortality.  That we don’t quite know where these two things will end and how does not need to be explained by “simulation theory”.

        Thomist Etienne Gilson solved this problem at the start of “Methodical Realism.” He was responding to the idealists, beginning with Descartes; and Descartes’ “Demon,” which is like the simulation theory. Gilson: “The first step on the realist path is to recognize that one has always been a realist; the second is to recognize that, however hard one tries to think differently, one will never manage to; the third is to realize that those who claim they think differently, think as realists as soon as they forget to act a part. If one then asks oneself why, one’s conversion to realism is all but complete.” The rest of the book elaborates on that.https://www.amazon.com/Methodical-Realism-Etienne-Gilson/dp/1586173049/On the economy, it recovered quickly because no permanent damage was done except for the deficit spending. Taxes, including tariff-taxes, remained relatively low. (Trump’s tariff-taxes would work because they would be compensated for by tax cuts in other areas.) The $35 trillion deficit is a real threat, but could be dealt with the way a similar debt was after World War II: prudent spending for 20 years. Although this time that won’t happen. And the drop in the dollar vs. gold, 30% the past year, guarantees future inflation unless curbed.The inability to find decent leaders is what happens at the end of empires.

        Other glitches in the Matrix. Charles NGO noticed the Zoom call fundraiser for Harris featuring White women only had a transgender individual who targeted him, and makes Pennywise the Clown feel uncomfortable and scared.Likewise James O’Keefe, who had a sting featuring a DNC drone who is of course, transgender. Like the Zoom call person, both transgenders are men pretending to be women.This triggers innate disgust and fear. Hollywood used to know this, with say Michael Caine featured as a transgender cross-dresser in “Dressed to Kill” (1980). Or Silence of the Lambs. Or even a Steven Segal movie: “Under Siege” — when a cross dresser or transgender showed up, it automatically triggered fear and disgust, effectively.Comedians from Uncle Milton, Milton Berle, to Monty Python, used drag to invoke that disgust/fear reflex to get a cheap laugh. See every black comedian: Martin Lawrence (Big Momma’s House), Eddie Murphy (Norbet), Tyler Perry (Madea moves ad infinitum), and of course Dave Chapelle.The more and more the various AWFLs and pet non-Whites supplant Cigarette Smoking Man behind the scenes, the more discontinuity appears in the narrative. The bigger the glitches. Because stuff like the above happens, and people innately get disgusted.

        his total lack of qualifications to do anything,this is a theme for Mr man of late. BO has talents. He may not have written a book, he may not have been a great law professor, he may not have been a great president, but I’m skeptical that he’s not talented at all, it could be said to be good with the right people, so he knows how to work with people.in a way this is perhaps the most important skill you can have. The silly meritocracy argument that only the qualified are hired , is not true, the likable are hired. There’s a spectrum of this but if you are not liked, you won’t be at the job long.BO is likable to the people that he needs to be likable to. Very few people can get away with being completely weird and antisocial and keep any job.similarly with the chad guy in the conservative podcast. The guy is good with relationships and fundraising, sales if you would. That’s a skill I’d like to have.

I have known, and even hired very likable people who were complete duds at their jobs.  They didn’t last long.  On the other hand I have worked and continue to work with some completely miserable SOBs who we keep on staff because they have real skills and can get things done.

I’ve dealt with some really arrogant a-holes in my career but my view was always “If they’re arrogant but can get the job done, I’ll keep them around.”Now if you’re arrogant AND hopeless at your job, well, the door is that way pal, here’s some cardboard boxes to carry your stuff. 👉🚪Jugears struck me as “prissy”  but you’re correct, he advanced because he didn’t come across like the other Diverse pols I saw in Chicago.

        I kinda still think if we get rid of the revolutionaries programing our media which feeds the brains of millions of people, a return to a normal stable simulation is possible. We just have too much chatter from the revolutionaries causing the population to go mad.We need a Walter Cronkite simulation where every day he calmly says ” and that is the way it is” and the people believe him.

        There is a great VR movie titled, “Viverium.” I warn you that it is extremely disturbing.We live in a world where we call anything that is a painting, drawing, rendering of music, film, play, book a, “piece or work of art.”No. Very little is a work of art, for very little is made by someone who has something deep and meaningful to say and some great lesson in ugliness and some great triumph in human beauty used to move us to internalize some deep human and/or folkish truth.Viverium is such a film. Again, I warn you that it is extremely unsettling. That warning should help you not stay up for two days afterwards as I did. I was expecting to see a nice little diddy about VR. There are a lot of lessons in her and possibly a premonition about the end that those who have constructed this VR we live have planned for us.

                There is no accounting for taste Vizzini. I can see the tedious interpretation or reaction. It was VR in the sense that they lived in an artificially constructed reality in which they were stuck.

            The whole “creativity” thing is a bit of a sham anyway, because every has already been created. Artists just move around the pieces in new ways. Of course, some do that with supreme genius like Rembrandt, but most modern artists don’t. Look at how Jackson Pollack is still revered today, yet his work looks like something my dog brought up.

        I am reluctant to get into IRL discussions of simulation theory because of the people in my acquaintance  who would go straight to Jean Baudrillard and “Simulacra and Simulation.”  But I have a natural disgust response to Baudrillard that has prevented me from reading more than a paragraph.

        I think it all comes down to idealism and people getting trapped in their minds. You end up with weird mysticism and secret knowledge and all of that, eventually insanity imo. Looked into Buddhism a lifetime ago, iirc there’s the idea that all is mind and mind is empty, or something like that. Hermeticism, gnosticism (Sophia lol) etc.— all smacks of the East to me.Much better to stay a little rough and tethered, to labor and ache a little imo. Greeks needed slaves so they had the leisure to philosophize, didn’t Aristotle say something to that effect? Maybe I’m getting mixed up. Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face, everybody drifts into the clouds until reality smacks them.

            Only if you watch it…and I mean that in all seriousness. The media “matrix” is only effective on people actively participate in it.I don’t watch that crap. I don’t watch the “news”. I don’t watch crappy TV shows. If I watch something at all, it’s commercial free. When the woke stuff inevitably appears, I skip over it or just switch the show off. My family has figured this out and it’s dawning on my Mrs. that all these shows she likes have suddenly been inundated with gay “couples” and gay this and gay that. I’m not sure when she threw the switch, but it was sometime after I pointed out that all Netflix-produced shows have a MANDATORY GAY PERSON. Just wait for it.  They’ll drop it in there 3-4 episodes in. It became a joke for us.  “Oh! There it is! Gay guy!” Then she started to notice it on her cooking and home shows. I reminded her that she’s being propagandized, and boom, one day she just stopped watching a bunch of stuff.It only has power over you if you choose to participate in it. It’s like any other form of emotional abuse. You’re a victim of it right up to the point when you decide you’re not going to participate anymore.

                Participation is crucial. But, as you intimate, ignorance is important, too. Ergo, if you watch or listen and are not aware of the propagandistic aspects, then you’re vulnerable. Once the light comes on, and you realize what the cultural zealots are doing, then their incantations have no power over you.

        Would it be possible to prove one way or the other that (in today’s context) that we live in a Matrix style simulation? I vote “probably not.” The same philosophical question has probably been pondered in many variants, such as Plato’s Cave. I’m familiar with the idea of “brain in a vat,” which term you may google if you care.I claim no particular expertise beyond a smattering of philosophy (yes, another Nietzsche quote coming, but patience dear reader) as well as extensive fiction, especially science fiction reading. It’s worth noting that literary genre likely has zero correlation with the quality, or lack thereof, of philosophical ideas hatched by the author. In other words, perhaps it’s just as possible to find a nugget of truth in an old B-Movie or pulp fiction as it’d be to find a patently absurd claim in a text written by a famous philosopher.Anyway, here’s the obligatory Nietzsche quote. This fromBeyond Good and Evil(I, 15). One must forgive Herr Fritz for his prolixity; even so, his style was, reportedly a vast improvement over the even more prolific printed pontifications of his predecessors as anyone who’s ever attempted to slog his way through Kant, or even Hume may attest.“[O]ne must insist on the fact that the sense-organs are not phenomena in the sense of the idealistic philosophy; as such they certainly could not be causes! Sensualism, therefore, at least as regulative hypothesis, if not as heuristic principle. What? And others say even that the external world is the work of our organs? But then our body, as a part of this external world, would be the work of our organs! But then our organs themselves would be the work of our organs! It seems to me that this is a complete REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM, if the conception CAUSA SUI is something fundamentally absurd. Consequently, the external world is NOT the work of our organs—?”As an interesting contrast, I would present a Buddhist teaching, one of the few concepts I kinda-sort grasp, is the doctrine ofanatta(not-self). Buddha doesn’t say what the self is, but rather what itis not! These are called the fiveskandras, which are: one’s physical form, one’s senses (the five normal ones, plus the mind in Buddhist belief), perceptions based on sensory input (e.g. color), choices, and consciousness.

            It’s impossible that this is a simulation
anyone who has ever programmed knows how impossible it would be to recreate existence
and like I always say, to truly know something means being able to make it. A guy who can make a car knows cars at a deeper level than even an ace mechanic. When we can actually make a dog, say, let me know.  Or even a flower
point being, the fact that we can’t make anything like this, let alone a galaxy, means we can’t really know these things beyond a certain depth.

        On the other hand, maybe there is evidence all around us,Particle theory is interesting like that.  Scientists would love a grand unified theory because then all the forces in the universe would have a rational structure, and yet all the pieces just sit separate, like tools in a toolbox (for example, knowing more about Higgs particles means you just know more about Higgs particles because their behavior is not related to, or like, anything else).Some people suggest that the drive toward creating artificial intelligence and virtual reality is evidence that we live in a simulation.Big “if” of course, but all simulations cannot exceed the limits of the container in which they’re run

Abject terror.What can be called Hell, the organo-formative layer, has no off switch. Any more than black mold crawling up the walls of an old house. It cannot stop itself, that is what the Whites are for. We are the white blood cells.Now that the Signal has been compromised by the strange accidents that led to the you-know-who and their role in Hell’s awakening, yes, there was a reason for our desperate panic. It’s very function is to reassemble new lifeforms from old parts; something strange and terrible is trying to be born.

        Occam’s Razor says the simplest explanation is probably correct. Maybe in this case. Couple this with the fact that an increasing majority of the planet’s inhabitants lack the imaginative capacity to grasp the concept of living in a simulation and you see the limitations of its utility as an explanation. OTOH, computer chips suddenly seem to be getting worse and airplane crashes are increasing in frequency. The simulation hitting programmed limits? Maybe.

        “To this day no one can say with confidence that he was born in the United States.”Sure they can. At least with the confidence with which they know they were themselves born in the US.Look, I’m a long time reader, listener and subscriber but I’m also close enough to Obama in age that in the course of my life I have known several people who knew him well growing up. People who knew him before his teens.  I have one friend who met his father during his lone return trip to HI. Barry’s story is believable because it was consistent: his dad returned to Africa when Barry was young and came back to visit his son Barry only once that I know of. That Barry idolized the father he never saw was clear but that was because he never saw him. Barry was raised by his White grandparents and longed to know more about the Black world. This is hardly surprising. There’s a reason you are living in West Virginia.There are prominent people who knew both of his parents in HI, and who remember the parents separating and also remember when Barry was born. Barry’s birth was published in the local paper as was the custom at the time.  The paper even named the hospital.There is absolutely nothing about Barry’s history that is remarkable with regard to the question of his birth aside from his decision to let his political enemies (Easterners mostly it would appear) embarrass themselves by refusing to cater to their demands to produce a birth certificate until after they had ruined their own credibility peddling the Kenya story over a course of years.  That Barry longed to go to Kenya in HS was obvious to his friends.  That he had never been there was just as obvious. In fact, had he ever been there it is a certainty he would have talked about it endlessly.  He wasn’t a recluse.I say all of the above because I respect your work which is why I’m a subscriber. But, in this matter I’m confident you are wrong.One of the oddities of the whole birther controversy to me was that the energy for it seemed to originate on the East Coast where Obama was least well known and Punahou’s reach wasn’t so significant. Remember, if you ever knew, Punahou was the largest private school west of the Mississippi River when Obama was a student (approx 400 per class), and the graduates spread out across the west coast. As a west coaster he was not an alien to folks like me. I live in a comparably modest sized west coast city but I know at least three people in my city alone, and one at my place of employment, who have known Obama since Punahou and some since childhood. If you go to California those numbers grow exponentially. None of these people doubt he was born in HI.I’ve been happy never posting and I doubt I will ever do so again. And I’m not using my subscriber email for this comment. But, I think it important for your own reputation that you abandon this dead end sooner rather than later.

        Quantum entanglement is when two subatomic particles are forced to interact with each other such that their state of being is dependent on the other. Then they are moved to opposite ends of the cosmos. When one of the two particles changes its state, the other changes its state in response, instantenously.In other words, with quantum entanglement, information moves instantenously, i.e. faster than speed of light.This is one instance indicating our cosmos might be a simulation. Which would mean God is an architect/hacker. That would explain why he had to rape an underage girl (Mary) while she was asleep. Those type of men tend to be pervy that way.

That America is a nation built on an idea, the idea that all men are equal.That fighting injustice is the way to salvation.
Of, course, the terms “equal” and “injustice” are a bit fuzzy to a herdmind.

            addendum: I forgot to add, “injustice” is defined as white racism- so maybe not so fuzzy on that one, at least. “Equal”, mostly used to mean the material gibs, makes Marxism an appropriate term.
Their moral basis (their religion) really is as shallow as a spoiled brat or sociopath’s, innit?
