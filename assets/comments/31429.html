        Evangelical Christians must be the most masochistic group in the world. They are diehard supporters of the nation that loathes them and their religion the most (Israel) and also diehard supporters of Trump, who spent his four years in office greasing The Swamp, which also loathes them.

            Must be the swamp that’s the really psychologically-messed-up group. So PDT “greases” them for four years, and they still spend their time 24/7 in 2024 trying to take them out? Wow.

        Nikki Haley gratuitously insulted me, so, I’ve got a grudge against her. If she needs my vote to become president; she ain’t getting it.
The South shall rise again!

        The AfD party continues to grow in popularity, and now voices are getting louder that it should be banned as they, like Trump, are a “threat to democracy”.
Democracy as they see it anyway.

        Z the courts and the Parties can do their worst , it’s probably not enough.You’re watching DC and it’s system slowly dissolving, the results will be worse than 1989 in Eastern Europe as there’s no succession, and no one to catch us – the FRG caught the DDR, America caught Poland and the rest… for good or ill they did not descend into chaos.
The dissolution of DC is closer to the fall of the Manchu in 1911 China.    Somewhat mitigated by our natural Federation in North America.

        I was talking with my mom, who is a Haley supporter. She’s roughly the same age as 3g4me. I told her that anyone who comes here from a nonwestern country should wait a few generations to run for president.As a counterexample, she brought up the story of how her late dad (my grandpa) converted to Catholicism when he was in his 30s and was a devoted member of the church for the rest of his life and how a convert often knows more than your run-of-the-mill person.The question then is – how do you argue against that? That kind of transactionalism can be accepted on one-on-one situations, but can’t be scaled up.

            I wouldn’t try to argue against that. Your mother is right, as far as it goes. I would just stick to the issues and patiently explain that Haley does not represent your position on things.

            The bubble that is going to pop Nikki Haley is that she is a forever-war Republican.  There are a lot of DEMOCRATS who hate this forever-war stuff.  Trump has a great message for those Democrats coming over to NH to vote in the GOP Primary: You want MORE war?  Vote Neocon Nikki.
500,000 Dead Ukranians?  That’s nothing.  American kids and grandkids are next.

                I’d say Nikki is a forever Dhimmirat in GOPe clothing.   She just wants to feed at the trough like Ryan, Romney, McCain, McConnell, and Chenney.   She has all the charm of Schiff, the intelligence of Biden, the honesty of Obama, the allure of Moooochelle, the integrity of the Hildabeast, and the courage of Pence.

            “The question then is – how do you argue against that?”
I typically argue the general case that, for most non-whites, most of the time, racial tribalism commands greater loyalty than the values that they profess to share with you.  OJ trial, black conservatives voting for Obama, mestizo GOP congressmen that are for open borders, ….
Of course, there are exceptions to the general statement, but how much time and energy is required to authenticate the exceptions?  Would allowing for some exceptions lead to accepting them all?

            Catholicism is a universal religion, open to all, but implicit and explicit in that is that you enter in full knowledge that you are accepting the Catholic hierarchy, the Magisterium’s teachings, etc. Speaking as someone who was baptized Catholic in the not-so-distant past, yes I do know more than the average person sitting in the pews on an average Sunday, but we all believe the same things.The American nation was built by people of European descent, people who have been of European descent since time immemorial. The people built America in their own image and it is a reflection of all those cultures. Problem is, you cannot just teach someone to build Europe – they just build it. After all, the Indians proved this without a doubt as the British spent centuries trying to teach them how to build it.

                Agree.  One would only convert to Catholicism after a spiritual and intellectual struggle in one’s eternal soul.
Coming to America to get out of a sh*t hole country doesn’t take any thought at all by comparison.

                    Yeah, universal religion. If you want the Pope’s permission to live on his planet; you have to be baptised into his religion.

                        You’re pretty ignorant and blast it forth – perhaps get a clue b4 going on about something you have no idea about? Just a thought….Luther came up with the Prot “religion” sitting on the crapper arguing with the Devil = Historical Fact. They still have the crapper he sat upon set up in a museum to him in Germany – Jesus Christ founded the Catholic (means UNIVERSAL) religion – bad Popes come and go like we are seeing right now – no one gets into Heaven who is not part of the Catholic/Universal Church whether that happens in the very last moments or whenever – perhaps do some real open minded research especially as to various Mystic Saints? Might help you….

        The Orange Cloud of Death descended on Iowa …(that was my favorite description in this blog in recent weeks) Just hilarious 😀

        I think many are missing the two big issues here shown in Iowa.First, some elites are moving Trumpwards. There are only two choices: Biden and not-Biden and Trump is the only not-Biden choice. Disasters abound: Ukraine and the coming big defeat there, outside of massive drafts of White people in Europe and the US; the Red Sea blockade done on the cheap with cheap drones and cheap missiles that the US Navy cannot beat; the flooding of the border with welfare obligations that will crowd out military spending (big Defense is not down with the open border, that spells doom for Raytheon, Boeing, etc. that have programs that run decades). None of this definitive and conclusive, but some elites do see that Biden has been a disaster and the only safe bet is Trump retrenchment cutting loose the Middle East, Ukraine, home-fracking, reshoring, kicking illegals and dependents and descendants out.Key takeaway: the people already here will crowd out nearly all military spending in five years. Even with Money Printer Go BRRRR.Next, most White Professional class people are moving Trump. Not because they love him but because he is again, the only not-Biden choice. They know inflation, Houthi-supply chain issues, Beer Flu supply issues lingering, AI, and above all DEI will cause massive firings of (White professional class) people. Already over 50,000 retail store closings are supposedly in the works this year, even Blackrock is laying people off. Now even the War Karens are getting let go. And they cannot find another job. Their uniform is their skin color even on their resume. Per Bloomberg only 6% of new hires post Summer of George (Floyd) were White. And approximately 100% of those were Rainbow Alphabet+.White professionals are looking at layoffs, with no hope of a job that pays even close to what they get now, and no opportunities: those go to vibrant “immigrants” and DEI-versity people.Haley has money, The support of those comfortably retired, the Democratic billionaires pumping money into her campaign (the founder of LinkedIn). That’s it. She has no solution at all to either terrified White professionals facing massive downward mobility as basically gig day labor or significant elements within the elite who don’t want the full Pol Pot road.According to Exit Polls (disclaimer: likely poorly run) Trump picked up a LOT of White professionals. They are terrified of being fired for AI/DEI and having no new job to go to; in today’s economy they will be last in line for everything.

            The irony is that Trump wasn’t at all capable of putting the brakes on DIE and most likely won’t be in the future either, even if re-elected.
We’re going to find out real soon in NH and SC if the GOP can rig primaries for their favorite. The polls in SC say it’s probably impossible.

            Good points, and don’t be surprised when the media can’t figure out why Trump is picking up a lot of anti-war Democrats.The Permanent War Party is roundly despised in this country these days.  I’m always asking “How many more wars do you people have to lose before you realize you’re incompetent and stupid?”I think a LOT of people are realizing the Permanent War Party is incompetent and stupid, even PWP members haven’t come to this conclusion yet.Yeah, there’s a lot of Trump haters out there.  But I think Trump will hammer home the message that things were not this f**ked up when he was President.  Most of what they hate him for?  Fake.  All the stuff they said he would cause (inflation, economic malaise, World War III)?  Biden has accomplished these, and more.Trump will be seen as a return to normalcy.

            Raytheon in particular has to be beside themselves regarding the open border.
This is because one of their key production facilities is located in Tuscon, just a stone’s throw from what was the southern border.

        Seeing the DeSantis marks on Twitter meltdown last night was enjoyable.  Pedro gonzalez, Steve deace, and Jenna Ellis come to mind.  Ann coulter said nothing last night, probably because her mouth was full of crow.  I am not a Trump fan boy, but I don’t have TDS, either.It just amuses me to see the Mitt Romney and Ted Cruz marks from past years continue to embarrass themselves.

            Jenna Ellis, who turned on Trump  is another good example of Trump’s foolish appointments.  She is a twat.  Pure and simple.  She smiled like a twat in her mug shot in Georgia and then folded like a cheap suit on the felony charge.  Trump’s attorney.  Put her on the list with Cohen and so many other bad choices.  It also shows you that no woman is going to go into the trenches to battle it out.  It’s not in their DNA.

        Are people even becoming aware of the ground shifting beneath their feet? Over the past week National Review ran articles praising Nikki Haley for wanting to gut Social Security alongside articles praising Joe Biden for illegally and unconstitutionally starting another war. Who could realistically call themselves a conservative today? This is pure farce. What the national parties (yes, plural, as the Dems are obviously coordinating with Ronna and co.) are doing is so obvious that even the most blinkered griller could see it. I watched most of the debates (albeit in a stream) and this party just has no future. It’s dead.Only Vivek was bringing anything to the table, and he saw, correctly, that there is too much overlap between his supporters and Trump’s for him to be viable in 2024. I give him a lot of credit for that, as unlike Meatball Ron he didn’t let his ego and delusions of grandeur ruin his political future.

            Mycale:  A subcon born to two non-citizen parents ought not to have ANY political future in what used to be America.  In AINO, however, he will do well as the representative of the next market-dominant minority waiting and working to take over from the juice.  His pose as a champion for Whites too timid to speak up for themselves, their forbearers, or their progeny is a clever ploy which will assuredly net him a seat ta the table next to Sunak and Varadkar etc.

            Trump is going to be able to use Vivek to his advantage.  He needs somebody else preaching MAGA and harassing Neocon Nikki.I don’t know if Trump is running ads in NH, but the ad I would run is “There are now over 500,000 dead Ukranian young men.  Neocon Nikki wants to give the women and children survivors weapons and send them on a suicide mission.  What do we have to show for Joe Biden’s incompetent war?  Democrat Party officials telling you to vote for Neocon Forever War Nikki.  That’s it.  That’s all we got to show for it.  That, and half a million dead Ukrainians.”I’d run that 24/7 in Massachusetts and NH.

                    Sure, absolutely.  Pols in DC are running scared on Ukraine because everyone – massive majorities – oppose going to war with Russia directly.  They’ve gotten by this far by hiding the mercenaries we’ve been sending.
Ukraine is the rope we use to hang them.

        I read that King Cobra has dropped out.  Perhaps he’s deemed that he’s accomplished enough in “this year’s cycle” to prepare for 2028.  Also, since the Republican’ts now won’t include him in their “debates,” he has no stage and mic access any more, or at least he can’t count on it.  Any stand up comedian denied access to a venue will simply move on from that venue, and this remains true even when the comedy venue is “the process” of “Our Democracy.”The downside to this is that what little amount of comic relief and entertainment was formerly present in this particular performance tent within Clown World is now gone.  Going forward, following this ongoing performance is going to be hella painful for whomever chooses to do so, chinese water torture type agony.

            I thought Biden would die of natural causes 2 years ago. Or maybe he did? Maybe “they” have technology that can realistically preserve and move a dead corpse for several years.
As for Trump, if he dies, it will be by a crazy lone wolf, a right-wing antisemitic extremist and white supremacist, who leaves behind a manifesto explaining that MAGA wasn’t fascist enough. He will do it with an AR-15. Media whores will discuss how it is all very ironic.

            If he has this wrapped up by Super Tuesday, expect there to be widespread calls in Democrat/Government Party media for him to be assassinated.  The Lawfare stuff seems to be in real trouble mainly because it is making Trump more, not less, popular.  And it’s proving his point that a) these prosecutions are fake and b) they’re doing it because they can’t beat him.
In short, they’re convincing people that there wasn’t an insurrection on 1/6/21.  But there should have been.

I have thought very long and hard about who my vice-president is going to be, Trump announces before the cameras. He has to be someone loyal, someone I can trust implicitly. He has to be someone from outside the system, as we saw what happens when I appoint someone like Pence. He has to be smart and charismatic, bold and unusual …
Therefore, I am selecting my own son, Don Jr., as my Vice-Presidential running mate. Thank you everyone, ladies and gentlemen. No questions please …

        Wall St’s emissary, Paul Krugman said it point blank on television. “In the end, the power that they, (Heritage, European Conservative Americans) have, is going to go away.” He said that in 2012, 2017? It was a while ago.Of course it isn’t going to evaporate, they are going to take it away. It is in broad daylight. Take away Trump, flood the country with 24+ million colonizers in 4 years, get them to vote and let natural demographics take the course. They have to get Trump now to eliminate the possibility of immigration being halted and deportations starting. Another four years and another 30, 40 million voters spread throughout every town and city in every state, and Krugman’s backers get what they want.It is that simple.

                “This is why we have to move on from the system. Those days are over. We create our own communities. That is our system.”Agree 100%.And that there encapsulates the entire future approach, in our lifetime. My parents moved out of the big city, “schools” and all that. No, they won’t be getting ‘reparations’ for what was lost to the new population(s) that now reside in their once beautiful neighborhoods.It’s a big country, so thinking in terms of the where and among the whom is the only realistic alternative. At least for middle aged adults. Then there is the issue of your children, grandchildren — not leaving them behind in the shitholes. That points up the need to save, avoid the debt serfdom, same for them and theirs.I watch these vidyas about ‘dead’ towns all over the country. Is it pure fantasy to think in terms of giving new life to such places? What is the alternative?

Where?
And–at least as far as I know–we don’t even have an agreed-upon means of communicating with each other when we can no longer use the internet, assuming that there will continue to be one accessible to us or anybody else.

            Trump’s latest on immigration isn’t “I’m going to build the wall and make Mexico pay for it.”  It’s, “We’re going to have the largest deportation program in world history.”That is a massive, massive, threat to a lot of people and he’s not saying he’ll get Mexico to pay for it.  The only way he carries that out is to deploy the US Military to round people up and put them on planes, ships, and buses back to their country of origin.And his “deportations” statement isn’t just aimed at whites.  It’s aimed at blacks and “Hispanics” in the most urban of urban enclaves…the sanctuary cities.  He doesn’t have to “win” in those cities.  He just needs to get them from 100% Biden to 95% Biden and he’ll win with 400 EV.

                One thing he may have power to do is to sour the milk.  The milk which attracts IA’s—employment and benefits.  Sour the milk to slow IA’s and then offer cash for self deportation.  Of course, sanctuary States will posture and protest, but let them then foot the bill for those IA’s flooding in.

                    Agreed, but simply being able to say the obvious out loud – deport them! – is a sea change in this country.  I think a lot of people feel resigned to 20% of their kids school populated with people who can’t speak English.
Deportations will be a popular theme.

        Z-man’s conspiracy theory is pretty good:  Haley is the Republican nominee by hook and crook, and Biden is such a disaster, Haley gets in.  One embarrassing compliant stooge replaced by a respectable compliant stooge.  It’s a great plan.
Watch South Carolina.  It seems to be a weird state (Lindsey Graham, really?), that is the Establishment’s fire-break.  They used it, in my life time to off Buchanan, foist McCain onto the ticket, and deep-six Bernie.  I am sure they’ll use it to finish-off Desantis.  There is just the remaining problem of the Orange Inferno, who jumped the fire-break in 2016.

            Trump won SC in 2016, in part because the Government Party “ticket splitter” strategy blew up in their faces.If Desantis does well enough in NH to stay in the race, Trump wins SC with 40-50% and Haley/Desantis each get 20% apiece like in Iowa.The problem the Government Party has right now is that Desantis is a goofball who hasn’t figured out yet how much people dislike him.  He’s not running to “stop Trump” or anything highbrow like that.  There is a distinct difference between the “stop Trump” people (Pence, Christie, Haley, etc.) and everyone else.  The “stop Trump” people will endorse Joe Biden if it means stopping Trump.  That’s what Nikki Romney is doing by endorsing Biden policies and talking nicely about Hillary Clinton.  Desantis is willing to benefit from the “stop Trump” efforts, but is not a Never Trumper.  His entire campaign is MAGA-lite.  The “stop Trump” people are running as Government Party apparatchiks – pro war, pro illegals, pro globalism.The “stop Trump” people are going to make a huge push to shove Desantis out of the race, but he’s not a stop Trump at any cost Republican.  He may actually believe the goofball things he is saying…in which case he gives SC voters two non-Trump candidates and they split and lose.

        As evidence that the Republican party is begrudgingly coming to terms with Trump as a candidate and possibly a President, gatekeepers Kurt Schlicter and Hugh Hewitt have each published articles demanding that the candidates name their nominees for their administration ASAP. Being helpful types, they offer their suggestions all of which are straight out of GOPe central casting. Schlicter offering Pompeo as a nominee for FBI Director is risible, but offering Nikki Haley as VP takes him off the charts of ridiculousness.
Link to Schlicter at Townhall. There’s a link to Hewitt in Schlicter’s article.

            It’s really amazing how the Trump tsunami is still taking down Con., Inc. poseurs 8+ years after his run in 2016.  I really thought for a time that Schlicter was at least dissident adjacent, but he’s gone all-out neocon/cuck recently.  I’ve been wondering lately whether the monetary support for cucks has dwindled so much recently that they’re just basically on call at this point to parrot a handful of Establishment talking points.

                I too used to like Schlichter, but he’s unzipped his rubber skin suit and revealed the weasel inside. Well, he is a lawyer after all.  Like that other weasel, Hewitt. There’s a guy who hasn’t been right about anything in decades. Plus he has a homosexual obsession with Romney. That “book” he wrote (A Mormon in The White House) was so embarrassing, probably 98% of the copies went straight into the pulping machines.

                Trump will need to make vigorous use of Acting cabinet members to bypass Senate confirmation. The political class will scream, but there’s little they can do about it. The Acting member gets 300 days, plus two additional terms of 210 days each for a total of 720 days.Trump’s biggest mistake in his first term was his failure to purge the government, starting with the military. His second biggest mistake was being duped into nominating Jeff Sessions for Attorney General. His third biggest mistake was being duped into nominating Bill Barr for Attorney General. Had he simply left Matt Whitaker in place he would likely have been able to shut down the election rigging that allowed Biden to steal the 2020 election.Trump should take his guidance from Caesar. Tell the corrupt and incompetent Senate to pound sand.

                    Sessions was a strong anti-immigration voice in the Senate.  I’m not sure why he was a problem for Trump except he cucked and recused himself because had actually had a dinner party conversation with a Russian and in confirmation hearings he didn’t admit or remember it.  That allowed for the rat faced Rod Rosenstein to take over and appoint Mueller. All that aside, I thought Sessions a good man.

            I think Schlichter’s main problem is that he’s never expanded beyond TownHall.com. Without that venue, where’s he going to go? AnnCoulter.com? With that weakness in mind, he has to toe the line with Katie Pavlich, and, to a lesser extent, the likes of Big Guys in that arena like Guy Benson.
True, he might just be another weasel. But he did make a valiant effort at trying to fight the steal. Lord knows, better than Trump did…

            Truly amazing that Schlicter paints himself as the establishment’s worst enemy, w/ his blue/red lit series — and then suggests Hailey, of all people, for VP? Does he have no understanding of what happened J-6 and what role Pence played in it?
Sure, let’s put another “e” candidate in, kurt. Duh.

        Your American elections are very interesting to us West Europeans, seeing that we are clearly vasall states at this point. So like the Illyrians, Gauls or Greeks of old, we hope that a somewhat agreeable emperor comes out on top in Rome. (“Nero is a lunatic but also a stay-at-home, so maybe he’s better for us than that brat Britannicus, who is an unknown quanitity.”) From the outside looking in, it seems impossible that Trump will be allowed to win. He seems to be really quite helpless against both the lawfare and the vote counting tricks. And if all else fails, the public has been endlessly pre-conditioned for his assasination. I hope that in early 2025 he is still alive, free and also President, but this time I won’t bet on it.

            From afar, at least, it seems to me that the EU is a far bigger problem for Europeans than the US.  The EU is probably far more responsible for the war and green BS than either the US or the individual member states.  The EU is the new Soviet Union, only far worse in some very important ways.  At least in the Soviet Union, a bunch of Poles couldn’t move to East Germany and create a bunch of trouble.  The Soviet blocks were never invaded by Africans and Middle Easterners and then allowed to victimize the population.The EU is by far the biggest danger to Europeans, by a very wide margin.

                Correct, Tars.
The commenter above mentions that West European states are ‘vassal’ states of the US (I assumed he meant this); but I don’t really see it that way. If the power of the US is waning – and it is – there are many other countries now who could construct alliances to rival it: Germany, France and the UK, for example; or, further afield, Russia and China.
Put simply, in the EU, I don’t believe US influence is the-be-all-and-end-all, it is strong – but there are stronger forces at home. One of which is the intensely demonic European Union.

                I get more of the vibe that the United States has morphed into the USSR and the EU simply is a new version of the East Bloc.
Relatedly, the GAE is toppling Central and South American governments and installing sodomy-compliant client states that in many ways do resemble the old communist dictatorships. As we know from the USSR, that’s all good fun until the cash runs out.

                Right, in and of itself the EU as an institution is a huge problem. But – at least – since 2019, when the current commission headed by Ms van der Leyen (our version of Kamala Harris, only not so pretty, not so smart) took over, the EU has been a transmission belt for whatever lunacy has been cooked up in Washington. 2004 is only 20 years back. Then, the EU would have never, ever followed the US into the Ukraine debacle. Back than, a large chunk of Europe actively resisted taking part in the Iraq war. Such independence would never happen today.

                    Yes. There still are a few cracks in the relationship that appear now and then*, but the relationship is totally different than twenty years ago. I think the United States blew up Nordstream II to try to cement that power dynamic, and short term it worked. Longer term the EU again will distance itself, in no small part due to the economic and military diminution of the United States. I suspect the EU itself doesn’t hold together much longer after that point, either.
*Israel’s ethnic cleansing of Palestine may widen those cracks in the near term.

        “but even a regime as evil and sterile as this one has some fear of the peasant revolt”I have come to believe the 2020 election indeed was rigged over fear of a bourgeois Leftist revolt–a completely justified fear, too. The Regime and its propaganda organs had jacked up these bizarre religious fanatics to the point where California, at a minimum, might have left the union, at least in a de facto fashion. The Regime knew full well the “Right” (for want of a better word) was full of hot air and would not lift a finger. This calculation was correct in the moment, but my guess is the Regime has done enough ham-handed bullshit since November 2020 that it no longer can assume the “Right”‘s compliance, either.  The white exit from the military and its near-collapse is Exhibit A in this phenomenon.Voting for Trump, then, is a no-confidence vote in the Regime (even more so than in the past). His removal would/will signal to the rest of the world that the Regime is too fragile to do much more than Ukraine-style clusterfucks in the future. Much was made of the sell-off in the Chinese stock market last night after Trump won, but that indicates a justified, wider belief that the consumer market here is not stable long term regardless of how the election plays out.” The regime is debating with itself whether now is the time to close the door entirely on the white voter.”The open border was supposed to act as insurance. Just a few days ago the grifter extraordinaire McConnell sent his cuck Judas goat Lankford to begin getting those illegal aliens registered. Two things have happened to throw all that into disarray. First, Texas (unbelievably) finally stepped up to stop the flow. This is reminiscent of Covid, which ended as soon as state resistance became too troublesome to the Regime. Secondly, the colored folks who are the backbone of the Coalition of the Fringes are pissed off that Juan and Pe and Raj are dipping their beaks into dey gibs.The Regime’s selected puppets–the third-party beneficiaries of the ongoing oppression–are screwing up bigly, and this crap is falling apart at breakneck speed. Until the economic collapse, whenever that occurs, localities will continue to peel away, society will fragment and the dissolution will accelerate.The pooch is screwed for all of us, and the shockingly inept election shenanigans simply reflect a much deeper rot.They couldn’t keep a Banana Republic, either.

            I do not see a peasant revolt on the “right,” at least not with the level of overt violence there would be with one from the left.  I do see a right “revolt” in the form of drop out – in particular wrt military participation, perhaps other public service type activities.  An economic drop out might occur, but more from circumstance than deliberate choice.  That is a big danger for a consumer based economy.  I could see a death spiral as loss of purchasing power becomes loss of consumption.

                I agree and that’s largely what I meant by “compliance.” I would not discount some aping of the Left’s misconduct, either, even though that is not permitted. The primary reaction is and will continue to be the “no-confidence vote” and detachment. That’s a solid point about consumerism, and part of the reason the Chinese stock market is reacting in the way it is (unstable shipping lanes loom large, too, thanks to Our Greatest Ally).

                I agree strongly, no one I know is spending any money on anything except food and gas and electricity. I moved a while ago to books and dvd’s, and now only watch the local weather on an antenna tv. No cell phone, just a landline, and just a low level laptop. Still wearing clothes from 10 years ago, buying bulk foods and doing the “one big pan of something to pick away at all week” cooking. We have a good woodstove and a big firewood pile, and a manual pump for our well. It is surprising how fast the money builds up once I gave up extraneous frivolities. Now I am saving for my cremation. This website and zerohedge and theburningplatform are my way of keeping in touch with world events. The comments here are most enlightening and encouraging. Please keep up the good work and thank you.

            Jack Dodson:  One quibble, if I may.  While Texas has taken what appears to be a stand against the feds, it is still a toothless pantomime of genuine ‘action.’  The National Guard soldiers in Eagle Pass are using plastic ‘riot shields’ to defend themselves against rock-throwing mestizos and han, and are not actually stopping anyone who makes it through the wire.When the National Guardsmen are issued weapons with orders to shoot to kill, then one may say Texas has taken a genuine step to counter  invasion and demographic replacement.  But until that highly unlikely event, don’t hold your breath – it’s still all kabuki theater.

                I may have misinterpreted what is happening, but it appeared the Texas Guard actually blocked the Border Guard from at least one area and took control of it. I think we agree the demographic ship has sailed, but if I understood this point correctly, it is a flex against the feds we haven’t seen previously even if the end result is kabuki. Anything that increases the antagonism is good albeit for a different reason.

But they’ve just replaced one “welcome wagon committee” with another that’s perhaps more neutral than welcoming.  What we need – and will not get –  are people who are actively hostile to the invasion and willing to use deadly force to stop it.

                        No disagreement as to what we need, of course, but widening the state and federal rift is not to be discounted as a net benefit. One of the white pills from Covid was how much it fueled that antagonism in a few significant jurisdictions.

                The China CSI Index has fallen almost by one half over the last three years, so not cutting rates certainly would have played a role. As to the point about American consumerism, that inevitable collapse has been baked into the cake a long time and Beijing explicitly made increasing domestic consumption a top goal with that in mind. The China Daily announced the inevitability of Trump’s return, which I still don’t think would be permitted even though signs are pointing to the Regime possibly allowing it, as a message to its bank(s) to get ready to juice the domestic markets just in case.As an aside, I that last also indicates once again that there are pro-China (Puritan/Han) and anti-China (Jewish/Subcon, uneasy as that it) factions at odds in the GAE. I don’t think  we appreciate how unstable this all is. Z once described the current situation as a “pirate’s cove” and that’s pretty apt.

        Trump is the establishment. He has 136 congressional endorsements, half of the GOP. He is a former president and has a unique advantage due to his cult of personality.However,the guy is a clown in a larger circus that is MAGA world. His legal troubles are in part due to his inability to get good people. Trump is lazy, he prefers to watch TV, tweet and play goft. The man never reads reports and advisors often complained he was disinterested during meetings.The United States is no longer a serious. Hence we have two corrupt octogenarians battling for who the country hates the least.

            I think you are the first person I have ever heard call Trump “lazy.”
He’s “disinterested” in government reports and daily briefings?  Say it isn’t so!!!  I read them for fun!  Some people read fiction for entertainment. Not me, I curl up with a good report.
The only realistic complaint you have about Trump is his propensity to surround himself with cucks and traitors.

            His “legal troubles” are the result of fabrications.  They arrested him for documents the government delivered to his house.  They arrested him for telling people to march peacefully and go home after offering the Wicked Witch of Congress military protection.  In GA, the AG paid her lover $1M to arrest Trump and they coordinated their indictment at the White House.  And that thing in NY is a complete joke…they’re prosecuting a borrower using a law meant to prosecute lenders.It’s all FAKE.  Because he’s not “establishment”.The most anti-establishment people in America today are straight, married, have more than 2 kids, attend church semi-regularly or regularly, don’t do drugs, own guns, and have honest jobs.

        The really odd thing about all this Trump hate is:
1) Trump never actually did anything that should scare the establishment
2) More importantly, the Dems are probably a decade – at most – away from locking in the presidency (and thus the Supreme Court over time) due to the passing of the Boomer generations and the decline of whites as a percent of voters.
The establishment could just wait this out, but, instead, they’re going to the mat and pissing off a lot of Normie whites. It’s another sign of the loss of competency in the ruling class.

                        It’s not the blacks and browns running the show. But the usual suspects seem to be getting tired of pretending not to run the show.
That said, as Hate Whitey coalition tightens its grip on power, the black and brown members along with the true believer whites will start demanding much harsher treatment of the “evil” whites who are preventing their utopia from emerging.
The usual suspects will have a harder and harder time keeping them under control. That’s when the fun begins.

                Agreed. The extreme ineptitude in dealing with the White Problem probably is pushing that timeline closer to the present, too.
@Citizen: The Regime may not believe it (I think they do, but still), but it certainly has to realize its third-party beneficiaries are making a hash of things. The incompetence is undeniable.

                    The old guard of the Dems is clinging to power and trying to keep the blacks, browns and true-believer whites in check, but it’s getting harder and harder.Competent whites and more pliable blacks and browns are slowly retiring from politics. The same thing is happening in the various regime agencies – FBI, CIA, state, etc. You’re already seeing the effects.The old guard can’t rely on it minions to get the job done without making a hash of it. But the real fun begins with the old guard finally submits to nature and leaves the seen. The old guard is the only thing holding back the Hate Whitey coalition from really taking it to whites.I know that it sounds weird, but I do believe that people like Schumer, who hate us as much as anybody, are smart enough to know that you can only take things so far. His replacement won’t understand this.The incompetency is showing up right now and will get worse. But it’s when the leadership at top finally gets replaced that the fun begins. When they go, you’ll have full incompetency at the top, bottom and middle – all directed at yours truly.

                We conflate the collective with the individuals.  The actual people moving forward the Establishment’s anti-White genocide have finite life spans. They want their glory and rewards now, not some honorarium for their committee in 20 years after they have been dead for 10.  See eg Pelosi.

                    (also @Citizen) Yes, it is very important to distinguish between the Regime and its foot soldiers. The accelerated pace of the looting indicates the Regime thinks the window is closing on its ability to do so; the ferocious lunacy of the foot soldiers indicates they think victory and utopia are just over the hill. Those two factions might come to loggerheads given their different time perceptions.The Usual Suspects have a rich history of taking everything not nailed down as they make for the exits. Their golem has no literal conception of time and no capacity to share in the spoils.

                        The problem for the usual suspects – a problem that most don’t seem to get – is that they’re got nowhere to go.Europe is filling with Muslims.

            It seems as if, at some point, “narrative fatigue” (is that the right term?) would set in. There’s only so long you can keep up the ruse that Donald Trump is some kind of existential threat to “democracy” before you admit to yourself that clearly, he is not. And tire of propagating it.

                It is unraveling now. The “present configuration” bit is key. And, no, the dissolution is not by design either, but the direct result of hatred, incompetence, malice, ignorance, hubris and greed, quite a toxic mix. The best-case scenario is the de facto fragmentation underway yields to, as they say now, a mostly peaceful resolution. Given those involved I wouldn’t bet the farm on it but hope springs eternal.

                @Infant, “The country doesn’t have ten years left in its present configuration.”
I don’t know. My money is on that they can keep the shitshow going on a while yet. There’s way too much wealth to be made still to allow it to collapse.
Look to things likeconfiscation, erm, transfer of 401(k)s and 403(b)s to bail out SS and CMS. As boomers die off, that will become much easier, since while most boomers have jack in savings, GenX has vastly less.

            He did something that terrified them more than any single policy or executive order:  he showed EVERYONE that the Republicans are completely fake, that Conservative Inc. is paid opposition, and that damn near everything people believed about their country is a damn lie.  The wars were a damn lie.  The economy, climate change, energy policy, all of it is a damn lie.You will never see a human being flip out more aggressively and hysterically than when they are caught repeatedly lying to their supposed friends.  The great value of Trump is that we no longer have to believe the lie.The entire system we are forced to live under is based on an agreed level of pretending.  What happens when people decide to stop pretending?  When they laugh at you and your lies?  When they call out – often within minutes or seconds – the latest b.s. from the regime and can “bring the receipts”?That complete collapse terrifies the Government Party.  Their entire business model relies on all of us pretending that there is an opposition party.There isn’t.  Their business model is in serious, serious, jeopardy.

            Oh they know that, and soon they will come up with a scheme to “deal” with their problem. There will come a day you’ll turn on a TV or radio to get their message that you must turn them all in TODAY.
The people (Democrats and RINOS) in your town who they’ll already have selected to do the dirty work will be the first ones to be purged. If they’re all dead or have gotten TF out to delay their early demise, then that problem will be solved. Your Democrat neighbors will be the next problem.

                “There will come a day you’ll turn on a TV or radio to get their message that you must turn them all in TODAY.”The so-called “border crisis” is nothing of the kind. Rather, it is the importation of an army–the enforcers–who are being imported to disarm the civilian population. And there won’t be an announcement; the enforcers will come when you are not at home and take whatever they find. You won’t get an appointment.And if by some unfortunate chance you happen to be at home when they come, they’ll make short work of it. That’s why they are being brought in.IMHO.

                    What you say may be one of their wet dreams, but they won’t have the time to organize it. The country is collapsing too fast and once the dollar loses reserve status, no one will want it anyhow.
BTW, if they send dark foreign people to Eastern Kentucky to collect the arms, how long do you think they would last here? And their collaborators who live here would receive a treatment so horrible, you’d need to read about the Sepoy Rebellion to get a good idea of what that would be like.

        The ongoing election shenanigans are a sideshow and distraction that is intended to keep the savages on hopium via voting harder. Meanwhile, in the backroom, there is serious talk about disease “X” and the technology required to internally tag every person with a RFID microchip that codes for identity and location tracking. Whomever gets selected as the figurehead president next year is not the real threat. Its the ensuing manufactured collapse and cacophony of violence that enables fast transition into high-tech tyranny.There will be fog that begets opportunity. Leave your neighbor alone. He is not the  problem. They want bottom tier alphas killing alphas. But they do not have a countermeasure for the bolt from the blue. Creative thinking is our birthright. So think outside the box.

I wonder how the Deagel predictions line up with the subsequent V@xxination percentages for each nation?
Likely to be eerily similar,I’d guess.

            ”  Leave your neighbor alone. He is not the problem.”
Ah, but your Democrat neighbor isn’t your problem yet. That doesn’t change the fact that he already wants you dead, but you won’t wake up to this fact. When the Democrats decide to start going after anyone against them with intent to exterminate YOU, that neighbor will be the one who will turn you in.

            The running bet is the regime either starts WWIII or works with a foreign power to unleash COVID 2.0…something with a mortality rate closer to 5%.  They need a way to cancel the elections or throw everything to “mail in voting” which is easy to rig.It’s just too hard to conceal election rigging on the scale that it looks like they are going to need to stop Trump.  If these prosecutions continue along with continued waves of illegals, they’re going to need to manufacture 15M-20M ballots in swing states.  In 2020 in all those swing states, they generated “just enough” ballots to overtake Trump.  They were able to do that because the margins were small and they could explain away the overnight jumps.  If he’s winning by 5-10% thanks to the “vote harder” brigades, they can’t overcome that because it would require semi trucks pulling up with preprinted ballots.  Ain’t no “election observers” falling for the “go home and we’ll continue counting tomorrow” lies this time around.

        So the main conclusion from last night is what I think we can call “Griller Collapse”.The actions of the Regime since the 2008 GFC have really collapsed the number of Grillers who will support old GOP. Many have been purged from the (minor in Iowa) corporate ranks and other “aspirational” Grillers who survived the GFC (small business people etc) got destroyed and/or disillusioned in Covid. The Iowa Farmers see a border invasion and no new Farm Bill for the last two years.It’s really just a numbers game. Middle Class/Griller shrinkage has reduced the democratic oxygen available to Haley and DeSantis. There’s really only enough oxygen for one of them. So the Media/MIC cabal will have to jettison one of them quickly. This should have been obvious from the jump, but here we are. Things will move faster now.

            A good point.The scale of DeSantis’s failure has been a surprise, even to those of us who’ve always rejected him. Respectable “verbal IQ”-type Republicans don’t care at all that he’s exposed himself as the anti-American neocon scumbag we always said he is. That’s who they are too, and, cozying ever closer to the regime, they increasingly revel in it. For them Ron’s humiliation is a social and psychological growth opportunity. They’re all-in for the whole run.But it turns out the plot to destroy the griller/worker middle class and the native petit bourgeois has already succeeded, so their standard-issue GOP avatars have no constituencies—not as a matter of ideology, but as a numerical fact. There are too few establishmentarian Republican voters to *do anything* in a national election.(Vivek got essentially zero support, too, despite being a neat TV character. So his campaign’s last act was to send his wife out to accuse “Iowa”—we know what that means—of racism and, in an impressive reach, Islamophobia. They just can’t stop themselves.)

I also suspect the plan is to have DeSantis exit and endorse Haley, but those two have such execrable supporters and handlers they easily may create circumstances too toxic for it to go off without a hitch. It will be fun to watch.

                The DeSantis meltdown is truly baffling.  He seemed to have such great potential if he endorsed Trump, sat out four years, and then ran as a more effective Trump 2.0.  He also seemed too smart to take the bait of being the last man standing after Trump is removed, especially given the number of R voters that would then sit on their hands in the general election.  And what is with the Israel crush?  I get that Jews are major donors and political insiders, but he dropped to his knees so fast and hard, it was like he was in the desert and Jew dick was a garden hose.

The ‘look’ was clearly designed to draw attention to the large Christian cross necklace she was wearing.
Maybe the first report was wrong. Everything is fake and gay in the Empire of Lies and Usury.

                I have a feeling Desantis has been drinking his own bath water for too long to endorse Nikki Romney.  His statement after getting trounced last night was straight out of Crazyland.The thing to remember about Desantis is that he was willing to benefit from the “stop Trump” movement, but is not actually running as a “stop Trump” Republican.  Nikki is, as were Pence, Christie, and the others.  Desantis ran as MAGA-lite – Trump without the baggage.Although I don’t discount it, I would be surprised if Desantis threw in with Nikki Romney.  If for no other reason than CASEY Desantis.  Hell hath no fury.  If Nikki had dropped out, her man would be mano-e-mano with Trump and Casey could be picking out WH curtains by now.  While Nikki is clearly running as the Democrat-Republican, Desantis still thinks he is Trump without the baggage.Anyway, Desantis didn’t get into the race as a “stop Trump” Republican.  The others did.

            Thus far in my prepping activity, the rodents seem to have no interest whatsoever in dried goods, such as the pasta or the legumes.In fact, even the cockroaches &amp; the ants don’t seem to be interested in the dried goods.I’ve been trying to wrap might head around it.It seems like the pests vastly prefer moist foodstuffs with abundant protein &amp; fat.And maybe sugars?I remember when I was a kid, the mice would get in the closet and eat the leather goods [leather buttons, leather belts, leather shoes, etc].But we don’t wear much leather anymore, and I haven’t noticed any gnawed leather in the last few years.Not sure what to make of it.

        Those last two paragraphs were exceptionally strong, Zman. You wouldn’t go wrong repeating them after every “election,” or even every week, as a reminder of the reality behind the theater of contemporary politics.Stylistically, I think you could further develop the thread of the analogy laid down in the opening paragraph, of a home combatting rodent infestation. It’s an inexact analogy, because in a normal home the rodents are an alien invader, while the problem with our political vermin is that they are in charge.However, in both cases the goal is to expel the rodents. Homeowners accomplish this by fortifying the home against rodent entry; disincentivizing the invaders (i.e. not leaving food around); outright extermination; or empowering a predator (like a cat) to hunt and eliminate the vermin. The first three strategies seem like lost causes in our politics. But that last one shows promise. What would be the analogue to a rodent-killing cat in our politics?

                We just lack the will, and the right person to terrify the courts into complying, largely by worry that they will just be ignored and look like fools.
People underestimate how little it takes to create a preference cascade with the right incentives. People are also far more malleable about their so-called principles than commonly thought.

                True, and good points all along this reply thread, to the effect that sufficient Will is the first step to addressing the immigration problem—and that Will is what’s lacking today. I share this assessment completely.But in Zman’s column, the rodent infestation he referred to was NOT about immigration, but about an infestation of grifters, phonies, and losers into the political arena. That’s the question I was asking about the “killer cat”—namely: What kind of factor, if introduced into the political arena, would so terrify and abuse the grifters that they would flee from that arena completely, and never enter it again?I have felt for a long time that a “balance of terror” is the only sure foundation for a sane and responsive political class. That’s when opponents know that if they transgress certain lines, they will have their transgressions turned back on them and be destroyed. The Republicans gave up terrorizing their opponents long ago, and so the left has been free to unleash its worst actors without cost or even opposition. Republicans can’t be relied on to be the “cat” among vermin—they ARE vermin—but what factor could take up that predatory role?

                    Two problems: 1) Our system of governance selects for rodents, and 2) It’s too difficult for a “balance of terror” to remain stable.  One side wins and becomes Putin.  What type of Putin we will get is the only question.

        A clue as to the utter delusion is the Regime is how easy, still, it would be to get Trump to play ball. Give him his hardline Immigration policy and they could easily get him to sign off on a massive Health Care upheaval, military boondoggles, and probably even reparations. The pigs would have a field day in the trough.

            D.T. is an Eighties-era liberal billionaire with old and deep ties to the mob, and thus to various sectors of intel.  Also, he is mucho megalomaniacal.  Everything is about The Donald.Donnie had his shot and first thing he did was ‘pardon’ Hillary, fill his admin with deep state stooges, and place his prog/feminist daughter in charge of the WH (adios Steve Bannon!).He claims Christianity but his ‘spiritual advisor’ is a New Age feminist/witch who — likewise — pretends she is a Christian.Not exactly my guy, to say the least.Before he vamoosed he ‘gifted’ us the poison vax, then he encouraged supporters to protest the ripoff election and when they did, the Regime locked them up and eff your ‘due process’.  Then he tipped on out to Mar-a-Lago.The progs (organized female power) hate him mostly because he is male.  The white thing runs a distant second, but is a factor.You ain’t getting out of this via politics.

            “Give him his hardline Immigration policy and they could easily get him to sign off…”  They wouldn’t even need to do that.  Just change all the illegal immigration at the border to legal immigration with visas and a “process”.  Same exact result, but now the normies would be on board, undercutting any attempt to stop our replacement.  But the Left can’t do that because they have a pathological need to spike the football and dance around in the endzone.

                Si, Projecto Muy Rapido!Grease it with an infrastructure 2.0 Bill that “pays” for the development of the physical pipeline of people, shortcuts regulatory barriers for housing and development, special financing vehicles and tax treatments, and keeps the “religious” NGOs in cake for another decade.The donor class gets a buffet. That’s what counts.As long as it is part of a New Deal Muh Economy is Who We Are “pathway”, the civnats and churchian Republican crypto progressives slink back beneath their anti-racisms, the bootstrappers and vampire capitalists get paid like with Covid or wars, and the bleeding hearts bathe in their moral primacy.The coming economic “insecurity” cascade will present only two options for the normie. Get poor or buy into the new deal. (And get poor. But it’s better than racist),Win win.

        Agree with the analysis but this is occurring against the backdrop of a collapsing empire. The regime is fiddling while Rome burns.
By the way, I can’t help but wonder: if Trump is removed from the ballot and Haley becomes the nominee, will the regime apparatus (aka deep state) back Haley rather than the senile old coot? In their position I would.

            That would actually be brilliant on their part.  You get the same governing results, and given that voters like to rotate Rs and Ds every 4-8 years, you would cleanse the palate and set up for another leftward run down the road.  Alas, they are too impatient and stupid, and sense they don’t need to play this game anymore.

                The primary function of the outwardly visible current_regime is to give its constituencies “the feeling that power is increasing”—to *minimally* drip-feed their madness so they don’t rush us into Total Civilization Death in a way that thwarts it as a longer-term, sustainable goal.No Republican can become President. The *average* Democratic voter—the “good people, but…” in your family—would be enraged to the point of open bloodlust, and the “activist base” would go full Rwanda. The propaganda/brainwashing has worked too well, gotten out ahead of practical plans.Hence the hurry at the border, the suicidal-seeming precipitation of global war, etc. The killers have to *catch up* to “Karen.” She demands collapse now. They want collapse forever. They’re not perfectly compatible.

            If the economy crashes, it would be great for them if a Republican was in office to take the blame…

        The idea the turd republican money is backing a freaking pajeet, let alone a female, let further alone one who technically isn’t even eligible to hold the office is disgusting.  Apparently there are no eligible White wymynzs available to at least try and appeal to White voters.  I still think the lawfare machinations will likely come to naught if Trump continues to run the table in the upcoming primaries – no one is going to buy that s***.  So, unless they actually bump him off, the reaction to that I doubt they’d like, they may just have to accept the results and figure Trump will be thwarted by the bureaucratic blob and toady media, just like last time.  I can’t believe they think Trump could pull off the swamp draining he’s blabbing about.  Something else is going to have to happen to upend the current system.

        I’m going to briefly relay a conversation I had yesterday with a intelligent conservative white man.We did both agree that the transgender movement was evil and then after that he started talking about how the chosen people were maligned and how his friend told him about going to visit Germany and the immigration person begged him to stay longer because they don’t have any of the chosen in Germany anymore and they really want some. I just said that’s a lie. That never happened. He was a little shocked at my bluntness. Then we got around to the borders being flooded and all he wanted to talk about was syrians walking into Europe. Didn’t even want to think about our border. I just kind of ended it with saying the great replacement is real and he knew it was. He did soberly say there is no place to go anymore. Probably thinking about his first white grandchild that’s about to be born. But I got to say I was flabbergasted by the whole conversation. This is a smart guy.

            I suspect the problem with most intelligent people is that they simplydon’t believe Evil exists. It is like a childish fiction to them; I mean, sure, the fellow says the transagenda is evil, but many say things are evil, without pausing to think: what is Evil? Who drives Evil?And that’s another beef I have with many smart people – they’re so invested in their intelligence, that they’d do anything to avoidbeing seen as unintelligent!Pride.Evil is real; and it’s increasing everyday because people let themselves be taken over by their own desires and whims. And when that happens, old Satan steps in and makes his plans.

            Completely agree that evil exists, and the denial is a huge flaw. I would also focus on your point that the friend is smart. I would apply Dunning-Kruger here. Yes, I know it is about self-efficacy and competency in a task. The implication, however, is that stupid people can never understand a smart person, nor can a smart person understand a stupid person. Your friend has to recognize that most of the world is so dumb that they would permit this behavior – that is the other half of this coin. This is quite difficult for a normal, smart person.

            It is worth pointing out, Johnson county, the county Haley won, is the home of the University of Iowa and the most liberal county in the state.  She won by one vote, if what I am seeing is up to date.  While I would say even the Republicans there would be more likely to be GOPe types, I would if some Democrats changed registration thinking they were going to stop Trump.I may be reading too much into this, the vote totals are really low, about 60% of the votes cast in the 2016 caucus.  Part of that may have been the weather as it was below zero in almost the entire state of Iowa yesterday.  I have to wonder if it also represents a growing dissatisfaction with playing along with the system.

                Registration? For a caucus? Let’s not overthink this. My experience with caucusing is you show up at the location (Republican or Democrat), get with the people who support your preferred candidate, and based on your relative numbers figure how many of the quota for your precinct or township you can get elected to the next, County level caucus. That caucus then selects for the state level, where the delegates for the national convention are finally chosen. The published poll results are likely a straw poll taken of attendees’ stated candidate preferences at the local level. It may just about approximate the final breakdown of delegates. Not an Iowan, but that’s my understanding of how it works.Of course, with no voter ID in many states and same-day registration, I don’t know how any partisan or other requirements are enforced even in primary states. American elections probably worked pretty well in 1789, and subsequently in rural townships across the country. They probably go alright in Iowa, where the illegal immigrant laborers working for farmers and slaughterhouses haven’t yet begun turning up at election events in overwhelming numbers. But as soon as waves of 19th-Century immigrants began arriving on the Eastern seaboard and were able to be organized politically, American elections, at least in the large urban areas, have always been a joke. Gradually, this has come to impact national politics to the point where we are today. The laws are still on the books to occupy the minds of conservatives; but they are becoming increasingly irrelevant in practice.

                    The people I know in Iowa have told me they have to sign in and register when the get to the caucus site and their name is checked against a registered voter list.  I don’t think it is easy to illegally vote at the Iowa Caucuses, at least on the Republican side.  Especially not in rural areas where the people checking in voters know most of the people when they see them.

                        True, American elections work in townships where people know each other. But within the urban populations of Des Moines or a university town with a transient population (or any place with undocumenteds) you are free to register/sign in as anyone you please. The “rules” may keep conservatives happy, but they really only work with specific populations like, for instance, that of 1789.

            The kids are home from school today and my daughter was watching fox and friends for a class project.The way they are fawning all over Nimrava was beyond sickening. Anyway, she asks me, “Dad, Trump won last night, right?” “Yes.”And Haley came in last pretty much right?” “Yes.” “So why have they interviewed her twice in the  last hour, why aren’t they interviewing DeSantis or Trump?”I explained that the owners of fox news hate Trump, don’t like DeSantis and want Haley to win, that’s why they keep her front and center.I also pointed something out that Nimrava said during one of her interviews, she said, “The American people want new blood, the two front runners are both in their eighties AND THE PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS, they’re ready to move on.”That one line jumped out at me and my daughter noticed it as well. “They’re illegally trying to throw Trump in jail and she doesn’t want an investigation into that?” She asked.I told her no. She then asked how I knew all of this and I sent her a few links to a number of sites, this being the first one. I hope I moved the needle in our direction.

                Mike,
Good to see you steer the lass in the right direction; when surrounded by Evil, it is all we can do to point it out. Doubly so when a child enquires and has legitimate questions.
Excellent job explaining the practicalities of MSM coverage of politics: they have their horse, and they back it; everything else is thrown under the rug.

        “There is a permanent majority called Democrats, a ceremonial opposition called Republican and the goal is to prevent the majority of citizens from getting any say. The results last night suggest they still have some work to do.”But even if the citizens do get their say via voting for their chosen figurehead, it does all really seem in vain. And probably has been for a couple of decades.When Trump succeeded in 2016, he pointed out a few bits, and as many here will agree, showed The System up for what it is; but, on-the-whole, the whole System still continued its lurch toward ever-growing-Evil.From a voting perspective, in the UK as well as the US, I just do not believe that any individual politician will take seriously actual concerns of the run-of-the-mill type of person (whatever that is anymore). The entire System is just so compromised by demonic forces, that it seems daft to hope.For example, if I were to vote now, I can give you a list of things I simplydo not care about:1. Islamic vs. Jew Desert War.2. Weird US triggered proxy war with Russia via Ukraine.3. “Equality” and “Equity”.4. Climate change.5. “Civil Rights”.6. “The cost of living crisis”.Not trying to rattle your cage, just seems like your last sentence admits that The System “has a way to go” – and I don’t believe it does. It is Evil enough, and getting more Evil – on-the-whole – by the day.

            You should have stopped at 5.  Because the cost of living crisis is very real and will likely get far worse.  This is something people genuinely care about.
Fighting climate change hysteria is probably something people should care about too. It is being used as an excuse to further impoverish us.

        All of this is amusing, but it does not change this: The United States is in the process of collapsing worse than that of the Soviet Union. For example, even their steel production never dropped to the same level of production it had in 1902, and their industrial products weren’t made from cheap, third rate parts MADE IN RED CHINA. Case in point- has anyone been to a Harley Davidson dealership lately and seen ANYTHING not made in China or Vietnam?Now don’t think that for one second these people who control this country and who destroyed it will go quietly into the night. They will get mad dog killing mean and your life and future existence will be in grave peril. On the other hand, at least the dirt people may have the change to liquidate or exile the half of the country who causes all of our problems.  Joseph Stalin was very right about one thing- there’s not a problem that death can’t solve.

            Yes, America is in the latter stages of collapse, with all-out looting by the in crowd, a catastrophic spiraling on debt, a fake President, and a weak military trying to fight wars all over the planet…Sauve qui peut….

            The US is actively supporting the Zionists in Israel with money, infinite weapons, targeting data, communication intercepts, etc to commit genocide.
“The Democrats don’t have foreign enemies.  They have foreigners who remind them of their domestic enemies.”
Make you think, as we see hordes of young men are encouraged to flood our borders by the millions.

            At the very least bet Francis Fukuyama is getting a little embarrassed.  I’m of two minds about an imminent collapse.  Lot of ruin in a nation.  We have plenty of food and energy resources if push comes to shove.  It could well stagger on.  On the other hand if supply chains get disrupted or the electrical grid goes down…  Americans are fat and lazy, but a couple of missed meals and a frosty ass could get ugly.  The blood tends to tell.

                I comfort myself a little remembering there are about 15MM hunters in the US, which is probably 10X the number of fighting forces the Feds could assemble.  Throw in other armed citizens and we are easily 100X larger.  But yes, it would take missed meals for them to engage.

                We make very few power grid parts in America anymore, as well as parts for about anything else. When this sucker goes down there will be very little getting repaired, and old “heritage” items will go for top dollar. The old stuff that can be repaired easily is what will keep on working.
I advise people to buy a few old style center draft kerosene lamps and keep them fixed up. I suspect when The Unraveling hits full speed, there will be many blackouts lasting long periods.
