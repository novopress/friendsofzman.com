        Years ago, when I was still a liberal and watched Chelsea Handler’s first show they would have a round table of comedians and I vividly remember Chelsea saying something about the space program and the black woman comedian saying “you white people and wanting to go to space” like it was a bunch of nonsense.  I think the average person doesn’t realize the amount of technology that’s come from the space program that they use in their everyday life .  But the main takeaway  is the ‘diverse’ people view this is a white person thing.

            Technological progress is pretty much a white thing. East Asians will adopt technology, just as long as it reinforces their cultural structures. The Japanese are the exception, as they are island people. Otherwise, it is a white thing to try things just to see if it can be done.

                I agree 100% Zman.  My wife is Korean and she told me “if you want something to get done all you need to do is tell and American it’s impossible”.    I guess those were the good old days.  I still don’t understand why after landing on the moon, building the Space Shuttle and doing a space station why we quit going to the moon and didn’t build a moon base there for future exploration.   Actually I do understand why: because it showed American Exceptionalism and it could lead to American world dominance and the leftists in America will have no part of either.

                    We never went to the moon, silly. NASA already admitted a human could not survive the Van Allen belt unless 14 inches of lead surrounded them. The moon lander was sheet aluminum. (Then NASA realized their mistake in saying that and tried to fix it with lies.)
A little more research next time. First time I’ve been disappointed in Zman. Most humans don’t know physics or their planet, shameful.

                I don’t believe this statement is true anymore. I’ve disclosed before that I work in the tech field and much of my work involves cutting edge technology with some of the top tech companies in the world. By my estimate engineering positions in the tech sector are now less than 10% white. It’s 90% Indian and Asian.I am in the Bay area this week for meetings that will be attended by engineering leaders from top tech companies in the Valley. I will likely be the only white guy in the room.The sad reality is that the tech sector simply cannot function without the influx of engineering talent from Asia.

                    I would argue this a result of West’s degenerate cultural shift and the systemic eradication of white men from the tech and science fields, starting in education and ending in the professional employment ranks.
My father is an electrical engineer and was fired 6 months from his retirement in the ‘economic downturn’ of 2008.  He got a new job shortly after at roughly 1/2 the pay.  I just learned he was let go yesterday and his replacement’s first language isn’t English.  They aren’t just driving the young men away, they are replacing the old ones with foreign models.

                        I meant this post to go to Guest, not Roulf, as poignant as his post was.
Do you really mean “can’t function?”  I operate in a similar environment but I believe we can function without Asian talent.  Do you agree that some major factors in the relative lack of whites are the bias of the HR departments and the anti-white preferences of top executives?

                    I dunno. I’ve worked with a lot of leading tech companies over the past 20 years either as an employee or a vendor, and what I see is that in the most agile, core engineering groups, there are still lots of White guys. I saw Asians move in first as part of off-shoring and other cost reduction efforts (cheap visa workers) and then as a deliberate program of nepotism by Asians that had their foot in the door. I have not noted that Asians are particularly better engineers, nor that there is a shortage of White guys. It’s just a foreign invasion on the high end, like the Hispanic invasion on the low end.

                        That sums up my experience as well.   We had some great visa engineers, and quite a few duds too.  Once one of them led a team it was bye-bye whitey.   Only some people are allowed to openly express in-group preference.

                    We did quite well for a long time without importing Bombay specials and Chinese grinders.  Things like the space program, the transistor, the microprocessor, microwave ovens, etc. This was all done by white men with side rules.
What changed was corporate leadership and the fact that a lot of geek leaders are nothing but cheap labor – sweat shop operators at heart.
If the Chinese were so good they wouldn’t steal everything bit of tech IP they can find. Their space program and much of their military aircraft advances were from stolen American tech designs.

                        I wonder how many cultures have sacrificed themselves on the altar of “Cheap Labor”? I can think of the Greeks, the Romans, the Confederates, the Rhodesians, the South Africans, the Spanish, and the Israelis just barely pulled back from the brink. I may be missing a few.
If history has any lessons, they are “There’s no such thing as cheap labor!” and “Pick your own damned cotton!” Those Americans who don’t realize this soon will, and good and hard.

                            I’ll agree to that. Anytime I’ve heard the words “cheap labor”, it was only cheap for the immediate consumer. For everyone else, including their descendants, “cheap labor” has turned out to be very, very expensive indeed.

                    To the extent anyone cares, it was me and one other white guy. Everyone else was Indian or Asian. All great people, fwiw. I can’t fault any of them for immigrating and attempting to make their way here.
I’m not passing any judgments here, just reporting facts. Something is very wrong in our culture.

                    Velcro and  Tang predate the US space program by several years and neither were developed for it.Com Sats are nice but they also facilitate globalism and oppression so its a two edged swordAs awful to consider the non White people are right to ask “How does NASA benefit me?” because for many of them, it really doesn’tEven White people get little out of space exploration, its a luxury for the geek elite mostly and it makes perfect sense why we stopped itIn the end most of the money we take in taxes is either used for endless warfare or retirement expenses and welfareAnd note too that Social Security exists for a reason , it reduces capital in circulation which is important. If we didn’t have it, we’d be so awash in capital that the economy would not function wellThe same technology automation and computers that make space travel possible also increase the size of the State.Basically more machines, wages down, jobs pay less, welfare goes up to keep the system working , rinse repeatThat same tech is also responsible in part for the abysmal birth rate and the lack of risk taking.In essence the space age was a product of a narrow window just before technology put society into a tail spinI doubt even if the Left is rendered utterly powerless in the political sphere we’ll have another space age and frankly for the bulk of us who get little from it, that’s fine.

        If a person could reasonably assume a working career that started in the mid-20’s and goes strong to 100, with a slight decline at the end, that’s roughly a 60 year prime working life. With twice the time, you take more risks and you take on different career objectives.I wonder if that’s how it would play out. For those driven geniuses who are passionately engaged in a project it might, and I suppose that’s what really counts, but I wonder what a 60 year prime working life would do for others.I’ve been working pretty much solid for 33-36 years depending on whether you count college (college is hard work if you’re taking it seriously). I’m about done.I’m successful and future-oriented enough that I am close to being able to retire and live essentially indefinitely off my investments. Because of that, I might chase new interests simply to keep active, but I doubt I will be as productive in my retirement as someone whose livelihood depends on it.For most people, though, life extension takes a ~50-year grind on the old hamster wheel and turns it into an ~80-year grind. That’s got to have some negative consequences.Psychologically, I’m not sure how well most of us are suited to living much longer than we already do.

            As I approach 60, I find I have lost some of the physical and mental nimbleness and strength, and I am frankly less interested in getting out there and making things happen—not that I would not like to see some of them done.  The joke is that old folks basically care about their last meal, their next meal, and the state of their health and health care.  It seems our broader culture has adopted that attitude over the last few decades.  And it doesn’t look like the multi-culti, diverse younger generation has much capability or interest either—specific individual exceptions certainly exist, but the broader movement and capability is gonzo.

                I’m pretty fit, but I have my age-related complaints. I wonder if we’d feel different in our perspectives if we felt like 30-year-olds. Life extension that increases the youthful and “healthy middle age” portions of the scale would be desirable. But I still wonder about the desirability of much longer careers. I have a really nice, intellectually stimulating job, with lots of opportunities to learn and push boundaries, but I just find myself psychologically not interested in doing that as much as when I was 30 or even 40.I’m also pretty disillusioned with corporate life. I’ve been around long enough to understand very well that companies today only pretend to care about you to the extent that they can get sufficient value out of you (and why should they care any more than that?), and that they’ll drop you like a hot potato if the perceive a change in their cost-benefit ratio. I’m no longer interested in being a “human resource.”

        Here’s the thing about space travel/colonization of the stars, we’re a species that has evolved through our ancestors) over millions of years to exist on this one planet with a singular environment (air breathing, 1G feeling, protected from hardcore cosmic radiation by the geomagnetic field…). This environment is near impossible to recreate in space, barring building another planet.The genetic and physical changes have been recently documented by those twin astronauts, one of whom stayed in space for a year. The changes to the space twin were not advantageous to his long term health and included a change of approximately 7% of his DNA now expresses itself differently than it did before.I’ll go with Carl Sagan on this one, we’re on spaceship Earth whether we like it or not. I for one am not interested in finding the next Xenomorph…

        Part of the stall was the bureaucratic take-over of the program and their intolerance for risk.  The Space Shuttle could have done far more – send it up to meet more fuel tanks, and it easily makes moon trips.  Instead it was turned into a transport to low orbit that was easily replaced by unmanned rockets.

            It’s also tied with the expansion of the nanny state. To go to space one has to able and willing to take risks. Not just career and financial risks, but actual put your life on the line risks. And those risk takers need to be celebrated for their risk taking.
Contrast that with the college in Pennsylvania which recently cancelled outdoor activities because they could be…too risky.

        I live near Cape Canaveral and go up to the space center from time to time. The thing that most impresses me is the Saturn V/ Apollo display they have hanging from the ceiling. The first time I looked up there at the Apollo capsule and Lunar Lander, I was like; “Holy Shit! those guys had giant brass balls to go to the moon (and hope to come back) in that tiny, cobbled together beer can.” I don’t think the West produces many men with testes of that size and composition these days. I’ve been in combat and have spent a career at sea, including deep-diving research submersibles and a long stint working in Antarctica, but just thinking about rolling the dice the way those guys did gives me the heebie-jeebies. If I had a son I’d try to instill that kind of fortitude, but since I am blessed with a brace of daughters, well…

        If our understanding of physics is correct (a big if I know), then while there may be billions and billions of habitable planets out there (in my best Sagan voice) humans can never reach them. We may be able to detect some of the nearer planets, but even those would take generations of travel time even with a life span of a couple hundred years. Good luck with that.And don’t get me started on Mars, the only other planet in our solar system that is even remotely habitable. It’s horrible. Maybe with a few thousand years of intense terraforming it could be made livable, but given human reproduction rates we’d fill it up PDG.If humans can’t get off this planet to expand into the galaxy, then it may be that intelligence is an evolutionary dead-end. It’s the ultimate absurdity of an absurd universe: a veritable feast of frontiers more vast than anybody can imagine, all hanging out there in the night sky right in front of us forever out of reach.

            Energy is the biggest problem. It takes a tremendous amount just to place even small objects into orbit. Until a form is developed that allows much larger objects to be placed, without bankrupting a country, probes are the best method of space exploration.

        I think the biggest problem for American’s and their quest for space is the lack of Nationalism for a common goal. America, like much of Europe, is fragmented into various groups and factions that are all about themselves, and not about the greater goal for the country as a whole. There is no vision of a future beyond the next election.Add to that a massive decline in STEM graduates, those who do graduate are not career bound to an industry. Global corporations have made it abundantly clear there is no such thing as corporate loyalty, at least not until they have determined whether or not they have met their quarterly financial goals.Technologically, speaking, we’re at a plateau in transportation. Air line travel won’t get exponentially faster (The Concorde put and end to that question). The speed of cars and trains is limited only by government regulations, not technology. As our grandfathers saw us go from horses to rocket ships in their own lifetime, we’d have to see teleportation for it to be an equivalent leap in technological advancement.With declining brain power around the world, the future is not that bright. Western Europeans brought us into the age of enlightenment. The duksy fellows still haven’t developed or fully grasped the most basic technology, with the exceptions of those things western civilization gave to them. And in most cases, they used it against themselves or their neighbors as they always have for thousands of years.Today’s information age does not raise all ships on a common tide as the industrial age once did. Where rail and steel made life better for everyone, everywhere, access to information is useless without the means to access or use it effectively. Railroads made life better for everyone through the distribution of goods and access to services, Easy access to porn and Twitter do very little to make a society better.

            Karl;You raise a number of important points about technological flowering, aerospace technological progress in particular, maybe indirectly.  If one looks at a number of exceptionally productive periods in particular countries it seems that they have in common:– strong nationalism,– a technological knowledge base created and maintained,– foreign pressure on the national elite (to maintain focus and provide funds, etc.),– a goldilocks amount of technological management focus.*All of these factors are lacking now.  So it may be that little will happen about going into space for quite some time.For example, there is no disputing that these factors applied to Germany, which made exceptional contributions to aeronautical engineering from the 1920’s through the 1940’s.**  And AFIK, Nazism, per se, had little to do with it.It was apparently true of Russia in the same period for the same reasons.  But since it was all highly compartmentalized and super secret, they derived much less benefit from their efforts.  France mostly lacked focus and urgency.  The English lacked funds for most of the period.The US in the same period was all about commercial aviation and so in 1940, our fighters sucked and our transports (and bombers_?) were second to none.  Were it not for UK goading and tech transfer we might not have caught up in fighters.After WWII, the above factors applied to the US during the Cold War Space Race.  When the USSR collapsed our national spring break kicked off and devolution set in.BTW, this analysis can be applied to the Age of (European) Discovery starting in the mid-1400s.  Islamic aggression both cut off trade in the Med and focused the elites in Spain and Portugal.  There was an Atlantic shipping knowledge base.  Prince John of Portugal and Queen Isabella of Spain applied funds and direction, etc.____________________________*Not too narrow, not too tight.** Germany invented, demonstrated and put into production: The ICBM, the cruse missile, the jet fighter, guided stand-off anti-ship weapons, etc.

        Earth is surrounded by a magnetic field called the Van Allen Belts.  They protect us from the radiation that permeates outer space.  Human travel outside the magnetic field is treated like work in a nuclear power plant.  You get a radiation badge, once the badge has filled up you don’t go back into a nuclear plant or back outside the Van Allen Belts.  There is at present no practicable solution to this problem when it comes to human space travel.But whatever, we just send robots.  That’s the career to pursue: building the spacecraft that can travel to the asteroid belts and drag one back into geosynchronous orbit around Earth.  From there you can start cutting off 2 trillion dollar chunks of Platinum and landing them in the Mojave.  Eventually you use the asteroid to anchor the first space elevator.  The outer space economy grows from there.

            Of course there is. A water jacket around the crew spaces. Since there is a need to bring lots of water anyways (even with cleaning/recycling) the water tanks will just wrap the crew spaces. In a nuclear submarine, a huge water tank sits right in front of the reactor to absorb any radiation that would go forward to (most) of the crew spaces, and all sleeping areas are forward of the tank.

        I think another thing you have to consider besides length of career is length of terms in office. Kennedy had intended that the moon shot would occur while he was still in office (if he hadn’t gotten shot and the Apollo 1 disaster hadn’t happened, he might have made it).The first thing every president does with regard to the space program is cancel his predecessor’s program. So I think you’re stuck with defining goals that can be accomplished within 8 years. So while a trip to Mars may be technically doable, it’s not yet technically doable within our current political constraints.This is why i think it was wise of Trump to refocus the manned space program on the moon. Mars may be preferable from a scientific perspective, but at this point it’s not likely to be accomplished within the 8 year limit, making it a non-starter.Given the political constraints, it’s probably better to focus on the moon and continue to develop our technology until it’s evolved to a point where a future president can commit to a Mars mission with a degree of certainty that it can be accomplished while he’s still in office.However, I note that China doesn’t share our political constraints. They’re in a position where they can commit to a 20+ year program with a high degree of confidence that it will be executed. Perhaps Mars will belong to the Chinese.

        Humans, if they don’t destroy technology, will eventually have a strong grasp of genetic engineering. That will lead to what we now think of as immortality, and improved intelligence.If I had to guess the fate of humans, I’d guess the solar system will eventually be colonized, and Earth will only be a part of a larger political entity. Whether it is benevolent will be seen, but the colonists will probably have escaping the tyranny of Earth as one of their reasons to leave.

        Will we have a big technological breakthrough that makes space travel easy – i.e. a gravity drive?  If we had a drive that could push a ship at 1G, anywhere in the galaxy is reachable in less than a lifetime. (for the passengers, not outside observers)
If not, going to even a near star is a giant engineering challenge.  An improved nuclear rocket design or solar sail still makes for a long trip.  Maybe multi-generational unless we can figure out hibernation techniques.

Some moral questions are interesting, but moot.
Barring safe, reliable hibernation technology, multi-generational ships would be the only way. The offspring would simply have to deal with it, like kids born in any new frontier.

                In the Expanse series, the Mormons had commissioned a multi-generation ship to travel to a different start.  Basically a giant spinning farm.

            Given that the particle physicists haven’t yet been able to detect gravitons, let alone generate anti-gravitons, I don’t think a gravity drive is in our near future.
Humans visiting other planets in our lifetimes using conventional rocket technologies is probably doable, but being able to travel to stars is still probably centuries away, if it’s even doable at all.

        I don’t think a fairly safe, spacious and comfortable moon base would be all that hard to build.  You know those inflatable tennis court structures, around an acre in size?  Well find a suitable size crater for one of these.  Plop one down and slightly inflate it with low pressure.  Now start back filling regolith (moon dirt) on top of it and gradually increase the air pressure as you do it.  With an internal air pressure of 15 PSI you will need ~40′ of dirt piled on top (assuming 5g/cc and moon gravity) to balance the air pressure.   Reinforce the interior and outfit at your leisure.  The 40′ of dirt above provides protection from cosmic radiation, protection from micrometeorites, thermal insulation, and relieves you of needing a strong pressure vessel.  A long while back another poster elsewhere suggested a design modified from a nuclear submarine as a manned construction shack.

            I hope so. Experiments with sealed environments on Earth haven’t gone well. There’s just a million things we’ve never even realized we haven’t thought about with regard to creating an enduring self-contained ecosystem in a vacuum. I’m sure it can be done, if we have the tolerance for some horrific catastrophes along the way. The vacuum of space doesn’t give many second chances.

                Not only that, there are things we don’t know about our own biology that may be show-stoppers. We didn’t know until recently that we were reliant on bacteria in our own digestive systems which are necessary for digesting food. We may be in for some other surprises regarding our dependancies when they become unavailable during long space trips.

            All the astronauts believe in the little green (or gray) men.  Personally, I think it’s bullsh*t, but sometimes when I look up at the night sky into the immense stillness, I sense a presence…oh, nevermind, it was just God or angels or the souls of my ancestors.  Or maybe the rabbit in the moon.

        To get anywhere in our galaxy requires immense periods of time. Genetics and robotics will lead the way. Why send up living humans? Send Human DNA from selected individuals and combine it 20 years from the place of interest. Grow it in an artificial womb and nurture it via a robotic nurse. Teach it the same way.Of course you can’t actually tell anyone this is what you’re doing, I can hear the howling about it. I would suggest the DNA would be selected from the people working on the project, thus they would have the ultimate incentive to devote their lives to it.

        My guess is the space program would require a lot more money to make that next leap. Sadly as we’ve seen lately the Washington DC corruption is so intense who knows when we’ll ever get off this rock ?
Agree with a couple of other posters that genetic engineering would need to happen to make more robust examples of ourselves to handle the rigors of space travel.
Right now our main concern seems to be who gets to use the bathroom at Starbucks. God help us.

        If there are really aliens wouldn’t it be much easier for us to figure out how they got here and  reverse engineer that?Now as for the more likely “rocket age” its maybe possible to explore the solar system but its essentially impossible to explore even near starsIf we could travel to  the planet with best chance of earth like conditions Ross 128 b at 1/10 lightspeed something that would require anti matter rockets which are unimaginably dangerous , a basic mission would take 220 years or so.  Its not gonna happenAlso even solar system travel fails cost benefit analysis other than to stroke the ego of the elite anyway.

        Well as many boomers have always lamented, where are our flying cars?Space exploration really will be limited to this solar system. What a waste for humans to do it and the effects of it will be quite harmful to them no matter what artificial gravity and radiation shielding they come up with. Terraform Venus, there is a project I can get behind.Suppose we can make a long hibernated journey to the nearest stars, so what? Is it supposed to be habitable? What if they find it nothing more than a bunch of gas planets. Generations to wait and much money to see basically nothing.Yeah, they naysayed …. name your scientific progress story here.
