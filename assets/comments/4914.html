            I will straight up sock someone straight in their nose if they ever utter the phrase, “that’s not who we are,” in my presence. I don’t care who they are, or where we are at the time.I’m old, and I’m willing to do jail time over it.

                “Wrong side of history” is one of the most important ones because it reveals how they see themselves as always-right Marty Stu characters in a Hegelian dialectic moving towards eternal progress.  They’re trying to tell a story and you’re rudely interrupting them.  It literally is a narrative.  Think of that diagram we’ve all seen where: monkeys -&gt; cavemen -&gt; humans.  When you realize they see you as obstructing that, you can understand why they could exterminate you and feel good doing it.As much as I’ve loved games like Sid Meier’s Civilization, the liberal notions of righteous progress are all too plainly baked in.

        Sustainable … a poor bedraggled word that the enviro crowd got a hold of which now means absolutely nothing and everything. generally refers to whatever new scheme theyre cooking up to get more money for their NGO
Carbon is another word that has been rendered meaningless

            What about gay, or rainbow? They don’t mean the same thing anymore. They used to mean, gay used to mean happy, or jovial, a rainbow used to mean a colorful scene usually after a storm. Those two words alone have basically stopped being used for thir original meanings! Sad.

        “As soon as you hear Official Conservatives™ talking about their principles, it means they are either about to throw in with the Left against you or they are preparing to surrender on some cultural issue.”
I recall a certain Conservative™ publication devoting an entire issue to the Case™ for throwing the election to Hillary Clinton. Principles! Without them we would lack a reason to keep losing, as Conservatives™ were born to do.

        This is one of your best posts.  I found the following phrases particularly grin-inducing:..dealing with HR..Having a conversation always means sitting through a lecture...fashionable mental disorders..thousands of jobs for liberal arts majors..Professional barnacles..attacking straight white males..No white men..the sound a white woman makesDoes the entry of women (in large numbers) into the workforce in the 70s thru the 90s explain nearly all of this?  🙂It seems like a mass phenomenon of make work is the root of it all.If you took all the air and froth out of the work place we would all be working 3-day weeks making about the same money.

            “Does the entry of women…in the work force explain this?”
Yes. They had to give us something to do besides making graphs, filing, making schedules, spreadsheets, &amp; coffee, and no one had the balls to send us back home.

        If white males were to use the term “unity”, it would not mean mass suicide.  It would mean Hitler is back.  Therefore, the term “unity” shall never be allowed to cross the white male’s lips.  Because Hitler.  Which is another loaded term.

            Welp, I’m a white woman, and I’m saying it. I’m ready for lots and lots of white male “unity.”I’ve long been of the mindset that things have to get much worse, before there’s any hope they will get any better, &amp; do not remotely believe in incremental changes and/or improvements happening or even helping, if they did occur.As you might have guessed, people revere me for 24/7 optimism, and funny, sunny outlook on life.

        I’m going to try to add to the list:
Problematic: A contradiction in the One True Faith that does not have an easy resolution, or a minor sin against the Faith by one of the faithful that can be forgiven if corrected.
Safe Space: A gathering of the faithful and nothing but the faithful.  Also no white guys, even if faithful.
Hate Speech: Heresy.
[Whatever] Rights: Special privileges.
Critical Theory: Theology.

        The progs even have their policing tribunals.This week John McEnroe commited heresy by saying that Serena Williams was the best female tennis player in the world. When pushed to remove female he said no, that their were probably 700 or so men that could beat her.The tribunal part comes when he goes on CBS’s morning show and facing those air heads where they push him to recant. You really have to see it to believe it.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qelAJA0AkH0

In other words they’re about to throw one of their own under the bus.
Excellent list. I see you have avoided listing managerial-speak as that is another Pandora’s Box altogether.

        Politically correct speech  is a euphemism for propaganda.  Propaganda is always a prelude to genocide, mokita protected as reflected in black-on-black violence and a disproportionate presence of planned parenthood clinics in minority neighborhoods.
The bellowing asses brandishing their battered Alinsky toolboxes are not our future.  They have not noticed their get-out-of jail free passes have expired.

        Wow_!  I cannot believe that TROUBLING is not yet on the list.  Used to be Tom Daschle’s favorite way of saying something like, “I can’t directly refute what you say/propose, but dealing directly with it does not advance my hidden plans for creating the path to utopia.”
Alternative meaning: “If you’re halfway serious about this, you better bring a lot of lobbyist money.”

        Controlling the language has always been important to the left. I think it may have been the realization of this that drove the Tory Dr. Johnson to write his dictionary. One thing I find interesting is that when the Soviet union fell it became more apparent to them that They were much less likely to be able to impose their attempts at utopia via a political solution, so they moved into the corporate world en masse. It was almost with a sense of relief that they did this. As if God had given them permission to be materialistically possessive while saving the world. Maybe this is why they like Reagan. Many of them got rich under his policies and they did a pretty good job of infiltrating everything that matters with social justice bullshit.The first changes were almost imperceptible. During those years I was reading a variety of magazines and newspapers, business and medicine oriented, as well as the conservative mags. The conservatives would complain about what was happening now and then, but the sense of inevitability was there from the get go. The idea of creating an alternative culture never occured to them. Once in a while I would find myself in conversation with people who could influence quite a bit of resources and would suggest things like creating a huge conservative data base that could be used for reference in political battles and get blank looks, now we have infogalactic. Another was having newspapers that weren’t just political commentary, but would want to be bought by the average Joe. Even suggested taking over classified advertising. Jeez. There are times I wish I’d been into computers rather than a surgeon.

            Join the discussionGood points all.I first became aware of conservatism in the US [I’m in Canada so we had weak imitations at most if that] in the 80s so my knowledge of the history is all retrospective. You can see ways in which it had the character of an insurgency, with the innovative use of direct mail and other things, the building of a policy infrastructure through alternative think tanks, etc.But in the end, they got coopted through such power as they had in the Reagan era. They were either soft-prog wonks, ‘compassionate conservatives’, or basically into cutting their own taxes and no other context, well before 2000.The death of National Review in the late 90s was emblematic. At minimum, they tossed religious, traditionalist, and nationalist interests overboard in favour of mainly Randian, class war, technocratic interests.I haven’t quite figured out if it’s just that they changed their idea of what could or would be conservable, if they were out of their depth when the old liberal foe morphed into the new and more all-encompassing progressive ideology, if they just didn’t understand the scale or depth of the new threat, how different the world could become, or if they never cared to begin with.Maybe, as Z has suggested on several occasions, they were never more than the slightly more anti-communist, slightly low tax wing of the progressive coalition and all the rest was 40 years of maskirovka.I know I’m pretty tired of David Frum at this point. Apropos of nothing.But you’re right. Whatever the goals, I recall conservatives making some innovations [that direct mail thing by Richard Viguerie was at least famous enough among conservatives that they were still writing about it in the 80s as a one of their great plays]. There were the think tanks, at the time a great new way of keeping wonks in the field which is not an unnecessary thing even now, and was critical in the influence battle then. But mass influence always eluded and seemed, as you say, to command little interest. Hard to fathom now.And it’s probably a mistake whatever form the new right takes will repeat, if it gets that far.

                The first signs of decline at NR we’re when people like Whittaker Chambers and Russell Kirk left. Then later on you had the ones we are more familiar with pushed out: Buchanan, Steyn, Derbyshire, Coulter, O’Sullivan. Earlier on you could say that the breaks were over points of emphasis and a desire to seem more mainstream. Later on it was more obvious that they cared more about what the left thought than their base of support or others on the right. They turned into Saul holding the coats of the Pharisees while they stoned Stephen. That’s where they remain.

        The destruction of language also makes civility impossible because it sows confusion and uncertainty (and by extension, loss of trust). This raises the level of societal anxiety because people don’t know what to believe anymore and must be on-guard against potential danger all the time. Most importantly, this means that we are not going to talk our way out of this mess. Best be prepared for when things go hot, because that course is becoming inevitable.

        Diversity: No white men!Remember when that hatred was directed only at the WASP in the US the last 40 years? In the last 5-10 years it’s morphed in general disdain of whites. It odd to watch the left try to identify who is actually white in America. Are Italians white – or Greeks, Poles, Arabs, French? Do they have some special advantage over the rest of society and should be blamed for being white. I don’t think many of the sub groups I mentioned are at the top 2%. That’s why this white man shit will backfire on the left. But challenge them on this and they sound like the racists – because it’s racism against the majority of the nation.

        “Human Resources”
This has replaced the old “Personnel Department” in companies. It started appearing in the seventies. Basically, it was an Orwellian phrase that meant “all humans are equal and valuable,” even if some were a drag on the company. In order for management to discover the error of their ways, their employees were now to be referred to as “human” and “resources”…not as “valuable” or “deadbeats.” Employees are no longer “personnel,” with all the variability which this implies. They are now “resources” which can either be squandered or nurtured.

        Great list.  All the magical words and phrases they use are based on group-think.  They are ways to make sure everyone in the cult has perfectly synchronized meaningless thoughts.
Normals who think for themselves, assess ideas and others’ opinions, and reach their own conclusions often don’t understand or even register these words.  They flow past our ears without registering like a fat girl passing across our field of vision.

        Great Post.  I suppose that it’s too trivial to plump for a general default rule to use  in the event of encountering a new/revised ProgSpeak term.  This rule needs to be source-based.Proposed Rule: If a term/phrase is from a communicant of the Prog religion, then, in the absence of more concrete information, one should assume that it is deliberately intended to deceive the normies.*The default form of deception is that the term effectively means the opposite of the surface words, either singly or in combination.   But usually one of the words in the string is anchored just enough to lend a surface plausibility.Examples abound: The Affordable Care Act is not affordable and is not about health _care_ at all (rather about its finance).  It is, however, most definitely an act.Or: The Reality Based Community is not a community in the usual organic sense of the word.  But regardless, their relationship to reality is tenuous at best.  ‘Based’ is deceptively used to _imply_  reality without actually establishing the fact of it.  Etc.* You did say this in effect, just not in so many words.

        Z- I’ve taken a web sanity break for a few weeks and just returned to these parts. So I’ve been reading back to June 12. A continued outpouring of good, bracing stuff. Makes me feel better and worse about things.Your posts on the PT Barnum Economy and Douchebag Society were especially good.The latter made me belatedly tweet Bret Stephens at some moderate length. I was admittedly only dimly aware of him. What an appalling post-national snot.Although, I concede he may have come up with a new variation on statehood and post national identity which for lack of a better summary I’m calling the mission-state or project-state. Citizenship contingent on being part of the mission and a full on team player. It’s a step beyond the market-state Philip Bobbitt imagined or the propositional- or values-state of leftists dreams. Imagine nationhood as a continent-spanning segment from “The Right Stuff”.I would rather return to feudal monarchy.

                Don’t forget the Democratic People’s Republic of Whatever.  It’s a joke now, but a great piece of propaganda back then.  Not to mention “base and superstructure” and all that — when they pretended to “fucking love science,” they really went all-out.  It’s so much easier to pretend to be smart when your propositions take a few Intro Philosophy courses to parse.  Nowadays, you can defeat pretty much any Leftist “idea” by saying “boys have a penis, girls have a vagina.”

            I think it has two meanings.  One is a contradiction in the One True Faith that doesn’t have a readily available resolution.  The second is a minor sin against the Faith by one of the faithful, which can be forgiven if remedied.

        “Badass” (noun) — an expression of admiration, used by a woman or a feminized man to describe another woman who has done something stupid, which required no bravery, for which the woman will never face consequences, and which reinforces and affirms the feminist sense of victimhood. Mattress Girl was frequently referred to as a badass.

Don’t even THINK about crossing this line in the sand, because we have many, many vested interests at stake and if you pull one single brick out of this government edifice, the whole thing will come crashing down. Plus we will fight you on the beaches and in the streets to keep this program running, no matter how worthless it is. Our very political existence is at stake here!!!!

        “The great misfortune of the twentieth Century is to have been the one in which the ideal of liberty was harnessed to the service of tyranny, the ideal of equality to the service of privilege, and all the aspirations and social forces included under the label of the “Left” enrolled in the service of impoverishment and enslavement. This immense imposture has falsified most of this century, partly through the faults of some of its greatest intellectuals. It has corrupted the language and action of politics down to tiny details of vocabulary, it has inverted the sense of morality and enthroned falsehood in the very center of human thought.”The Flight From Truth: The Reign of Deceit in the Age of Information1991, Random House Jean-Francois Revel

        I didn’t realize that “woke” was a Prog term.  I’ve read it on alt-right sites, and since I don’t read Prog sites, I haven’t encountered it in its natural habitat.  Are Alt-Righters using it ironically, or are they just picking up the enemy’s weapon and using it against him?

            “Woke” is a black term, (and also used by their leftist pets)sometimes used ironically by the alt-right or the youths,any other whites who do not understand how to meme it, probably should not use it.Non-degenerate white people can only become “red pilled,” they cannot become “woke.”My advice-never say you are “woke.”
