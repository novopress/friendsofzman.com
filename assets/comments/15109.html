        &gt;There’s no reason why Jews in America could not simply throw in with the white majority.
Might want to cut that line when you publish this otherwise decent essay in your book.

        Not sure if this is a common suspicion on our side.  But I started wondering when reading this thread, could the passionately anti-Jew guys be government plants intending to cause discord within our movement?

            Crabs in a bucket. There’s always an element in outsider politics that strives to keep it small and fringe. It’s like the fans of a new restaurant. Instead of being flattered by the sudden popularity of the place, the early fans are insulted and say it has gone commercial. They strive to keep it their “secret place.” Meanwhile, the owner wants to pay his rent and turn a profit.In politics, this results in endless demands for purity and the adoption of ever more fringe positions. The extreme antisemites are simply staking out a position that is the far extreme possible in order to maintain the illusion that they are the truest of true believers. It’s why they insist that they are the most red-pilled.

                Elitism’s not so bad. 300 years of leftist takeover have essentially been vanguarded by purists (or Puritans…)What the right lacks is perspective – the willingness to accept impure leaders in the spirit of gradual change. But I’m also sympathetic to the aggressive purity-spiraling (toxic as it is) because the right has been blatantly betrayed so many times in the past century.The left has very few outright traitors. While there are different degrees of fanaticism, I think the average voter understands intuitively that any Democrat is going to work for Team Left. With “thought leaders” like Bill Kristol and Ben Shapiro, the right has good reason to be paranoid.

        I have a more parsimonious prediction:
Liberal Jews will disappear almost entirely within a few generations due to low fertility and intermarriage. Orthodox Jews, who are much more conservative, will outcompete them, as they have done in Israel.
So you will indeed see a rightward shift in the Jewish population from Gen Z onward, provided that America doesn’t import another army of Bolsheviks like it retardedly did after WWII.
Of course, these will mostly be cuckservative/civnat types, which are only marginally more useful than liberals. The Stephen Millers are black swans.

            Lance, the rightward shift of which you speak could make a big diff.The Steve Miller types will have a much better shot at the others, than he has now.This esp. applies to the civnats, from whom I emerged a few years ago.Trump is largely civnat, and is a huge improvement from his predecessors, esp. in moving the Overton window..

                A lot of actual liberals (white and Jew) will convert too, if the overton window moves that far. The normie is more concerned with staying inside the window than any deep principles. Civ nats are just a little more sensible and patriotic than left-liberals.
But keep in mind we are talking about a generational shift. We may not see this until we’re old and gray, assuming any of us live that long.

                    I think the Overton window will eventually crack wide open, w room for things we could hardly imagine, the way things are going. The left is hardly even bothering to hide that they simply hate whitey. That’s gotta focus some attentions here and there.

And likewise with the Pussy-haters, esp. in this Kavanaugh affair, which was presaged by the diatribe in the 8 June WaPo, “Why can’t we hate men?”, by Suzanna Danuta Walters.

        Reading Z’s post in a Bing Crosby voice comes easy.  He was perfectly reasonable, subtle, and calm.  Reading the hot-head retorts you’d think he’d written something controversial.   You can read those in a Howard Dean voice.

            I don’t have the link right now, but there’s a guy who does YouTube videos on old warplane tech who sounds exactly like Z. So much so that I seriously wonder if it’s him. But, damn, where would he find the time?

        “it will certainly be hostile to the sort of cosmopolitanism Jews have historically preferred. Jews could be left without a home.”
Interesting post. I think cosmopolitan people would always be left homeless if the mood turns more tribal. I am personally happy to have patriotic Jews join our ranks. But I also think issues arising between Jews and traditionally patriotic white westerners must not be made taboo. B/c starting w a taboo is not the way to build trust.

            “I am personally happy to have patriotic Jews join our ranks.”Therein lies the rub. Do you mean “our” patriotic, or (their) patriotic. If it’s the former then they would already be part of our ranks.  If it’s the latter then we’d just be welcoming hordes of dispossessed Jews looking to slime their way into a new society.  We all know what happens from there: “In the 60’s and 70’s some disaffected Jewish intellectuals made the journey to the Right”

                I mean ‘OUR patriotic’. And perhaps they already are in our ranks?? If so good. My point is that being Jewish is not in and of itself a disqualifier to me.

                “If it’s the former then they would already be part of our ranks.”Not necessarily.Plenty of Gentiles aren’t in our ranks, but still may deserve to be seen as patriotic.We have a case to make, but very many folks have heard at most a fraction of it, and then often only in the most misleading of ways.

                    I forget if it was Z’s podcast or I heard it somewhere else but, Jew or Gentile, no one can persuade as many of them to wake up as reality itself. They need to see the situation deteriorate. All our efforts cant persuade many, only society tanking can, unfortunately.

                You mean that’s how most Mainline Protestants vote. And that’s how a fair number of Catholics like, say, NJ’s governor Phil Murphy vote. Fans of Pope Francis. There’s a lot of ’em, e.g, my sister-in-law, who refuses now to talk to me for obvious reasons. My take is that there’s a lot of Jews who’d be surprised to learn that they’re somehow different from other white ethnics like, say, Poles, Greeks, and Irish. A lot of ’em eat bacon and give their children Christmas presents. And what about guys like Stephen Miller, without whom I’d probably have given up on the Trump administration?

        The situation for neoconservatives is vastly worse than for liberal Jews. The neocons went all in on opposition to Trump’s primary run, launching the NeverTrump movement and then worked to undermine Trump in the general. It was a disastrous miscalculation as it probably helped Trump tap into the deep well of resentment among whites toward the neocon elite that captured the party in the Bush years. Rather than remaining in the coalition debating policy, they have placed themselves at odds with the Trump coalition.———-Given that neocons have ruled the ‘right’ since the early 80’s at least and still control Congress and much of everything else, a four  hiatus from the oval office is not exactly the end of the world for them.

        If there is one single thing I sense is most lacking in the small Jewish plantation of dissident thinkers, it is an unapologetic, continuous, firm, and vocal disparagement of the Jewish political culture. It would need be in quite the same vein as Glenn Filthie took with his own family. A complete break. The price is what it is. Absent that commitment, may they find their latest advantage anywhere else. The Right does not seek an advantage, it seeks a home.

        I know this is a bit out of context but …… within the last couple of weeks, Ben Shapiro has replaced John Bachelor on WMAL’s 8-10 pm time slot. That pisses me off to some degree. John Bachelor has a very interesting show discussing history, books, big events, etc. and it is free from the shrill talking points of the day and focuses on longer term and issues from a historical perspective. I know Ben Shapiro is supposed to be the voice of modern conservatism or something, but, he sounds like a guy posturing for something, and after listening to him a couple of times I just do not really like hearing him talk. He will never be the 2nd coming of Mark Levine or something.

        Michael Medved, writing in Commentary magazine:https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/why-are-jews-liberals-a-symposium/“For most American Jews, the core of their Jewish identity isn’t solidarity with Israel; it’s rejection of Christianity. …. Jewish voters don’t embrace candidates based on their support for the state of Israel as much as they passionately oppose candidates based on their identification with Christianity—especially the fervent evangelicalism of the dreaded ‘Christian Right.’ This political pattern reflects the fact that opposition to Christianity—not love for Judaism, Jews, or Israel—remains the sole unifying element in an increasingly fractious and secularized community…“The anti-Christian obsessions of American Jews lead not only to skewed perceptions of our true friends and enemies but also to anomalous definitions of “Jewish issues.” Much of the communal establishment insists, for instance, that their support of same-sex marriage and “abortion rights” expresses timeless Jewish values. Why and how? In 3,000 years of well-documented tradition prior to, say, 1970, there was not the slightest hint of any sort of endorsement of homosexual coupling. Moreover, Jewish law has always frowned upon abortion, authorizing the procedure only in extreme cases where the welfare of the mother is profoundly threatened. The liberal belief that Jews should be pro-choice and pro–gay marriage has nothing to do with connecting to Jewish tradition and everything to do with disassociating from Christian conservatives.”

        “Still, the bulk of of Jews fit neatly into the stereotype of cosmopolitan Jew.”The one thing that you could say unifies almost all Jews is being an urban people. Being almost entirely city folk does explain a lot of Jewish positions and outlook on most issues. (This actually was one of the positions Zionism was trying to fix, the argument being that the Jews were not a healthy people because they were overly urban and needed to return to the land to become normal as a people.)“Another complication is that Team Brown is not all that fond of Jews.”Liberal Jews have been glossing over this for years; they can get away with the illusion because they live pretty isolated lives, just like Whites who share the same class. Most of them would go nuts if you mention that they mostly live more segregated lives than anything that ever existed anywhere else in the history of this country but that’s the reality. Meanwhile a Hasid in Crown Heights doesn’t have the same luxury to play pretend.“The situation for neoconservatives is vastly worse than for liberal Jews. The neocons went all in on opposition to Trump’s primary run, launching the NeverTrump movement and then worked to undermine Trump in the general.”NeverTrump didn’t make sense to me at first; after all Trump was a pretty blank slate to work with and it wouldn’t have taken much effort to say nice things and get a stranglehold on positions in his administration. But thinking on it, NeverTrump makes perfect sense as a straight New York class issue. Basically Bill Kristol and the rest of his crowd are Manhattan snobs and it absolutely galls them that an Outer Borough ethnic like Trump (not physically but definitely culturally) managed to get the ultimate prize while they waste their lives on the outer rim talk show circuit.On the whole though, NeverTrump was a good thing; it helped to flush the system a little faster. The problem we have is that we could use new blood but the people in power don’t want to retire. The neoconservative movement, like a lot of organizations, was built for a specific time and place; it outlasted that moment but instead of closing up shop, it lumbered on like a movie monster, waiting to be put down. Maybe this way, without a political home, it can go the natural way of all movements and be replaced by something else that is more of a fit for the times.“Taken together, what’s shaping up for Jews in America is a political arrangement where they have no natural home.”Part of the problem with all these analysis is that it never really touches on the fact that Jews are as much in transition as every other group. Liberal Jewish identity is mostly hollowed out; assimilation and intermarriage is at an extremely high point, mainstream Jewish institutions are morbid and lumbering, and the demographic engine for Jews is mostly in what were considered unpopular, fringe groups in the Jewish world even just 50 years ago. Whatever American Jewry is developing into, its not going to resemble the people and positions that have been holding sway the past 40 years. I don’t think that the “Urban Amish” Jewish population of the future is going to hang onto the same political arrangement that exists today.“Liberal Jews are increasingly at risk in the Left coalition due to looking a bit too pale for Team Brown.”You can already see the outlines of where Liberal Jews are going to go; the old crowd that was leadership (or at least powerful) will be hustled off stage one way or another (Harvey Weinstein isn’t being prosecuted for rape as much as for not quietly retiring when he hit old age…), and the rest will be allowed to remain as window dressing or for funding purposes as long as they follow the strict party line – basically #Metoo/BLM/JFP (last one is Justice for Palestine) and not a peep about anything else. Smile wide when Louis Farrakhan takes the stage or else… (If you want a glimpse at the Democrats in 15 years, take a look across the pond at the UK Labor Party…)“While it is not explicitly antisemitic, despite what some claim, it will certainly be hostile to the sort of cosmopolitanism Jews have historically preferred. Jews could be left without a home.”I’m not so sure; short of a bloody revolution that wipes out existing elites, what we might end up with is something like a line of Trumps. That’s bad news for Liberal Jews but that segment of Jewry is dying off. What remains will probably be much more in line with a populist figure like Trump. Populism isn’t unpopular among Orthodox Jews. The future might be less Bill Kristol and Marc Mezvinsky and more Stephen Miller and a lot of Chabadniks in the spotlight instead.“It is beginning to look as if the Jewish century is curdling into a Jewish disaster for Jews in America.”Jews only really came to prominence in the West in the last 200 years; before that they were as much on the fringe as the Amish are today. I think that this is where demographics is taking us back to. The Jewish population is changing and the Jews of the future will be more likely to be more locally powerful than nationally so. (NY/NJ/Pennsylvania is likely to have a strong Jewish base; that is where the Orthodox are having children and also spreading out to as they are being priced out of NYC.)  I also think that the future is likely to be less centralized internally in the United States; we may be heading back to sectionalism or federalism after a certain point.“That said, Jews are the most adaptive people in human history. There’s no reason why Jews in America could not simply throw in with the white majority. Just as the neocons broke with the Left over opposition to the Soviets, perhaps liberal Jews will break with the Left over the issue of identity politics. ”Liberal Jews are not going to just thrown in with the white majority unless their class does as well. Those Liberal Jews are mainly Liberal and mostly assimilated into the Liberal class; if Liberal Whites switch over, the Liberal Jews (or whats left of them when it happens) will follow. In the meantime, they’ll throw over absolutely everything they can to stay where they are. Israel is already going under the bus in their circles and they’ll throw everything else out too before they get there.(If you don’t believe me, check out Michael Chabon’s commencement speech to the graduating class of Hebrew Union College this year. HUC is the main home of Reform Judaism and these graduates are supposed to be the future leaders of that branch of Jewry.  He spent an hour lecturing them on the evils of Israel, how borders are wicked, that endogamous marriage is a ghetto, and how he regrets everything he has to do with Judaism (including marrying his wife) except his command over a half dozen words in Yiddish. Again this was in a speech to a graduating class that is supposed to keep the Reform Jewish movement going. And the school basically praised him for it afterwards. I believe that the Jewish community of the future will eventually end up throwing in with the white majority but it will be less HUC graduates and more Lubavitchers setting up in Jersey and Central Pennsylvania. You can’t escape demographics.)

            Super stuff, Brooklyn, esp. on the urban and intermarriage aspects, and on “Liberal Jewish identity is mostly hollowed out”.
One of the things most irritating things about most JQ-ers is that, they’re stuck fighting the last war.Maybe they just don’t actually know any Jews well enough, to see what’s quite obvious to those of us who do.

        If (or when) the time comes to fight for our lives, evolutionary history teaches that (over the long run) it will be the strong and smart that tend to persist and endure. It really won’t matter much how you came by those attributes (e.g. parent’s genes, inherited identity, absorbed cultural biases, or personal dedication, etc.), you will either prevail or expire based upon the best you can put forth. Lots of study/analysis has gone into forecasting what a future conflict might look like, and fealty to esoteric group affiliations is unlikely to be determinative. Our species is not a hive organism.

        Jews are around thousands of years. Why not ask people, who crossed them in history? Like Russian Tsar family, some peasants in Europe or they neighbors in Middle East…. Because there are not killing fields in America as results of Jewish policies, you should probably align with them. Some people complaint about opioid deaths, but there is no connection to Jews 🙂 This time it will sure work well with goys .

        Whites on the left are starting to be displaced by Cortez-like and other POC candidates. There are more and more calls to replace the old whites like Pelosi and Feinstein. Feinstein is a good one to watch. It’ll be interesting to see how she tries to navigate. She has held some (relatively) conservative views, but always knew to toe the liberal line in order to get re-elected. Other old white lefties are going with the flow, trying to stay relevant as their party lurches to the left of Che. They may indeed be left out all alone (a very dangerous place to be) or wind up weaseling their way into the right, relying on magnanimity.

        Genetic evidence indicates that ashkenazi men intermarried with goyische women in Poland, Silesia, Germany about 600-800 years ago, and thus…who’s Jewish?Not to mention they are tribe of Japheth, not Shem.  Japheth who begat Gomer who begat Ashkenaz.Who’s Jewish?Whatever.Letting an alien elite, whatever they want to call themselves as, take control of our currency (and all Western nation’s currencies) and then use the monopoly power of wealth creation to come into possession of all major media, in an age of technological advancement that makes media the most powerful propaganda tool in human history, was probably not a great idea.They have succeeded in casting upon all the West a spell, like the Witch placed on Puddleglum, causing the West to forget about the sky and sun, to see only darkness, and to embrace a death wish.It was Puddleglum’s foot in the fire that woke him from his torpor.  What will it take for Western man to awaken?  Already we see the first fruits in leaders such as Victor Orban, who now finds himself fully in the glare of Sauron, in the form of the death-embracing EU prostitutes.  The childless witches, such as Merkel, May and Macron, see no reason to protect their people, their posterity.  They have none!  And even Zman sees the majority of whites fit for nothing but…SLAVERY!Choose your next step carefully, Western Man.  Door No. 1, you win, possibly, a chance at existence.Behind Door No. 2 lies only extermination.

        Zman, just wanted to let you know I appreciate all your efforts in sharing your observations, perspective and opinion. I also tend to agree with you on this matter. It’s a pity that so many here reflexively flip out at the mere mention of Jews. Yes, they have wrought a level of destruction but have also contributed greatly. Here’s a question to the frothing Jew-loon: was the Frankfurt Schoolentirelymade up of Jews? You sure they didn’t get their orders directly from the temple in Jerusalem?

            Tax, the Jews’ main trouble is that they’re so damn vivid.When a Jew ruins something, everyone notices that he’s a Jew.Similarly with the Irish, but at least they’re Christians, so some fellow Christians sort of stick up for them.But if, say, we Bohunks ruin something, virtually no one (at least since Hitler) uses it to tee off on us as a group.  We’re just better at laying low.

            Okay, I’ll bite.was the Frankfurt School entirely made up of Jews?No, of course not. Ever heard of the Pareto Principle?  When the bulk of a problem comes from a single source, that’s where you direct your attention first.You sure they didn’t get their orders directly from the temple in Jerusalem?Yes, I’m sure. Just like I’m sure the British don’t have to be told directly by the queen to be stoic, and sub Saharan Africans don’t have to be told to have tons of children despite malnutrition and poverty. People have natures, and the different nations have different natures.  You can believe that God created the different nations, or you can believe that different proto-human ancestors and different environmental selection pressures caused divergent evolution, but you can’t think we’re all the same without telling yourself a lot of comfortable lies.

A 30 point difference in IQ between Icelanders and Somalis explains a lot. But Icelanders too were once tribal. And probably had lots of kids when early death was more common.

        A few years ago I took a world religions class in college. We had guest speakers and field trips: we visited the local mosque and Hindu temples. We spoke with Muslims, Hindus, witches, evangelical Christians. They all discussed their faith and what it means to be a follower of their religion.Except the rabbi…  He spent the entire time discussing the Holocaust, how gun control is good, and how Israel has to defend itself from its enemies. Not one word about what it means to be a Jew (unless being a Jew means lecturing everyone on the Holocaust and gun control).The temple Judaism where the priests sacrifice animals disappeared when the   Temple fell. Then came rabbinic Judaism with synagogues instead of a central    temple (distributed Judaism?). It’s almost like the Holocaust destroyed rabbinicJudaism and gave birth to what? Holocaust Judaism?

            I’ve heard that is what reformed synagogues are like – not the scripture (Old Testament) reading and preaching I would have expected.
Is it the same in an Orthodox or Conservative synagogue?  Or do they actually practice the religion?

                I think that falls under the heading “Israel has a right to defend itself.” Oh there was one more topic he discussed: money. He explained that Hannukah services are really expensive if you want to attend.
The entire field trip was a breeding ground for anti-Semitism. Whereas the other religious speakers were kind and compassionate in their own way, the rabbi was wound up, strident, and verbally aggressive. Really unpleasant man.

                    Strictly speaking, it wasn’t a breeding ground for “anti-Semitism,” which doesn’t exist as a separate category (viz., we already have a word for bigotry, and that word is “bigotry”).Based on your description, what your experience was, was the basis for beginning to form an unfavorable opinion of a particular human type, based on your observation and personal interaction.  If you were to meet three more rabbis, and two gave you a favorable impression and one did not, then your judgment would simply grow more varied and complex.But “antisemitism” is effectively a racist term and concept, as it implies that bigotry directed against a particular group is somehow more worthy of notice and analysis than the sufferings of other persecuted groups.  It also sows confusion and misunderstanding, as it tends to conflate irrational hatred against the Other merely qua Other, with potentially legitimate grievances and criticisms of an identifiable market-dominant minority who exhibit observable behavior patterns which are the cause of legitimate grievances.Jews use this word as a kind of get-out-of-jail-free card, to which other parties can should forcefully object.

        I have nothing against Jews, and admire many of their accomplishments. And, as noted above, a significant number of Jews (although far from a majority) are on our side and wish us well. But this knee-jerk hostility that a good many Jews display towards Christianity really does have to be addressed. For example, David Cole over at Taki’s mag is about as based a Jew as you’ll find; he’s even questioned some aspects of Holocaust Industry mythology, at great, great  cost to himself. And yet, in a recent column, he goes off on a tirade against the late Lawrence Auster, calling him an “Honorary Aryan” and implying all sorts of nastiness, even though Auster was a firm supporter of Israel. And why? Because Auster, born a (secular) Jew, converted to Christianity!Jews are rightly wary of anti-Semitism. Anti-Christianism is just as ugly.

            Toddy, my sense of this is that Cole is an eccentric outlier, and that most Righty Jews have very respectful, if not outright warm, attitudes toward Christians (particularly really serious ones), esp. since 9/11 rubbed all of our noses into the degeneracy of most of Islam.See e.g. the writings of Kalman Kaplan, and other Jews who write for the Journal of Psychology and Christianity.

                    Well, Toddy, my sense of things is that, a certain number of far Lefty Jews (esp. the pro-Arab ones!) do indeed despise the Righty Jews’ warmth toward Christians.
This gap among Jews, between those with warm attitudes toward Christians, vs. the pro-Arab ones, is a far bigger deal than most Americans (incl. righties) understand.I’ll *guess* that Europeans have a rather better feel for this.

        That said, Jews are the most adaptive people in human history. There’s no reason why Jews in America could not simply throw in with the white majority.
That would have worked 20 years ago, even 10 years ago. Maybe even 5 years ago.

        The constant in elite Jewish politics isn’t left or right, it’s revolution vs accepting the status quo, with Jews always on the side of revolution.That’s why Trotskyites were able to transition so quickly to becoming neocons, because the neocon idea is to make the US the engine of worldwide revolution rather than the USSR.  Trotskyism was actually reactionary as it looked back on the day before Stalin when it appeared possible that the USSR could be the base for revolution (when Stalin took over he consolidated power and eventually turned the tables upside down on the Jews).  This is why the neocons attracted conservative types.  When the 6 day war happened in Israel the Trotskyites realized that the revolution was going to be happening elsewhere.

        IMHO jewish voters will never leave the leftist socialist / progressive ideology and will vote accordingly; excepting the Hasidim, who are held in contempt by reform and/or Ashkenazi jews.If the left becomes even more blatantly anti-Semitic watch as jewish “leaders” bend ever greater backwards to remain within that ideological fold.Notice that neither Chuckie Schumer nor Diane Feinstein have uttered one word expressing any concern of the anti-semitic rhetoric emanating from their party  nor have they said anything about the influence that Linda Sarsour (who should be deported to Syria to join what remains of ISIS)  has gained within the “democrat” party, or of Obama’s friendship with that all around nice guy,  civil libertarian, and jew hater, Louis Farrakhan.You know, if somebody was good pals with Hitler, you could surmise that that individual shared and endorsed Hitler’s ideas and policies.Funny how Schumer, Feinstein, et. al., keep their mouth shut despite Obama’s – as well as the entire Congressional black caucuses –  friendship with Farrakhan.And if I recall, Obama’s other good pal, “Reverend” Wright, was also no fan of the chosen people.Nope, there is no way that jewish folks will ever leave the neo-communist, progressive/socialist religion.

        It seems like the Tribe’s in an impossible dilemma.  Even if they wanted to join Team White — I mean 100%, all the way, everyone changes his name to Slade Jackington van Pelt IV — half of Team White wouldn’t let them.  “Once a Jew, always a Jew” seems to be the rule — Karl Marx was antisemitic enough to give the Stormfront guys wood, but as his father was Jewish, Marxism is forever a “Jewish movement.”  (Ditto Lenin).  Every other white group in America gets a pass — nobody seriously suspects you of being a Vatican double agent if your name’s Seamus O’Connor and you follow Notre Dame football, but “we” all know that Slade Jackington van Pelt IV was once Schlomo Goldstein, and we’ll never ever ever let him forget it.  Which, I assume, is why Z Man wrote “if the option is even open.”  What if it isn’t?  Seriously: What then?  Deport ’em all to Madagascar?  This kind of thing is why Our Thing will never be more than a few guys grousing on the Internet.

        I have a great admiration for you, but:1. Please do not fall into the group rationality fallacy. It is the fundamental flaw of the MacDonald thesis. Group rationality is a very poor concept to predict behavior. Elementary Nash equilibrium analysis shows that when the effect on the outcomes of the group of individual actions is small (infinitesimal) group interest is sacrificed in the computation of the optimal strategy of the individual. A group from this point of view is large when the number is larger than 10, imagine when it is in the millions.2. As an example, the group interest of people of African descent in South Africa is to keep a small group (10 per cent) of whites and milk them to the point at which they are inidifferent between staying and leaving. It would be a wonderful situation for them: but they will not follow that route, because it would mean admitting that whites can do something better than they can. So they will go for the small individual pride reward of feeling “we don’t need anything from them”, and will then proceed into starvation in a few years.3. In a multiethnic society spite is widespread. The group with highest spite for West African in the USA is probably the Somalis, and in fact they have started gang wars where they live together. Second group in the ranking is Hispanics, non-white ones. Does it mean that the coalition will break? No, because they have a common interest in milking the privileged minority. However, no, they will not stop at an optimal point, as I argued already in point 2.4. Groups do not learn. A group can give a substantial contribution to the creation of the Soviet regime, end up being discriminated (or worse, ice picks in the head or Siberia), then manage to escape to the USA, and…. create Google.5. Neocons: there is nothing new under the sun of LDB Trotsky. In a former life I had to deal with Trotskyists, their defining philosophical principle is entryism.6, The Frankfurt School 2 that is flourishing today is even more vicious and extreme than the 1.0 version. I predict that it will continue in the same direction. At some point, maybe, there is going to be a breakup of someone that will object, and there will be an interesting contribution from them (Leo Strauss was not, or was not only a neo-con). But it will be (and it is) a small minority.

            Given that I’ve compared McDonald’s theory to intelligent design, you can be sure I will never be promoting group evolutionary strategy. That said, it does not mean groups don’t have interests. They obviously do and they obviously work to advance them.

        Why do the Jews have to go anywhere? As long as they are willing to take a back seat in the Democrat Party, and to allow the Keith Ellison and Roy Perez’s to be the Party’s front, they can control it and them via funding. They also have a great deal of actual control on non-Jewish individuals in Congress, the Executive and the Courts. Witness our absurd and fundamentally anti-American policies in the Middle East, Africa, Central Asia and Eastern Europe. These policies are generated, controlled and imposed on the US by Jewish neocons. Even Trump has been forced to kneel before the neocons. Add to that their control of the MSM, Hollywood and much of the banking sector, and they need not change anything, especially their party affiliation. They have won. It’s over.

            It is a fair point and something I should have mentioned. It is entirely possible that Jews simply withdraw from conventional politics entirely. There’s also a collapse of Jewish cultural identity going on so what it means to be a Jew in 25 years will be nothing like what it means today.

                    @jaqship:  “See my post above, at 10:53 am, about the kids of Jews who marry Gentiles.”Wishful thinking at best, misdirection more likely.  The vast majority of such inter-religious marriages result in kids raised with a heightened sense of Jewish cultural identity.  Tons of half and quarter Jews boast that particular part of their identity – even though, in most cases, the Jewish parent (often male but sometimes female) will claim to have no sense of Jewish identity or claim not to care what religion any future children might be raised believing.Jews have been warning about “collapsing” Jewish  identity and massive rates of mixed marriages for decades now.  Still waiting . . .

Still waiting.”Nobody is “waiting” for the  massive rates of mixed marriages, it’s happening, not only to Jews, but to all white ethnic etc. groups.I fear that many Alt-righters still don’t understand the power of a MSM-saturated culture to overwhelm traditional identities, and replace them with new ones, *esp.* SJW-ism.The good news from this, such as it is, is that social media are enabling the emergence of the Counter-identity of Whiteness, to replace the old hyphenated-Americanism of the Poles, Germans, etc.Too bad so many JQers just have to use *ad hominems*, like charging me with “misdirection”.With such conduct, such folks figure to remain enmeshed in their echo-chamber.Such stuff makes me quite sympathize with Zman’s reluctance to write about the JQ.

        Hey, OT sort of, except with regard to the JQ, my comments about Paulism vs libertarianism and the flow of talent from libertarianism to the alt right.  There is a great short essay by Jared Howe in the new book A Fair Hearing from arktos media.  Many great essays in this book, but in that essay he discusses the “libertarian to alt right pipeline,” and what is driving the alt right conversions at the high levels is a sort of buckleyite purge of anyone who dares to discuss closed borders in a positive light.  Yes, he fingers exactly the same people…

            Libertarianism makes sense when you believe that there is one correct value hierarchy, which everyone will come to if they think about it.  Once you accept that biology and culture shape your values, it’s a nice, slow roll to the fourteen words.

        I dunno enough about Joos either. Historically they’ve been kicked out of every country they ever settled in, and to be honest, American politics would be better tomorrow if every Joo politico were turned into soap today. But the same could be said of pretty much all the liberals too.
When we start hanging the traitors and internal enemies of our nation it won’t matter to me one whit what flavour of vibrant they are. As long as they die hard and serve as a warning to the others, I am good with it.

        Good article Zman, but I believe your projecting what you want to happen or what you believe should happen. The best current example of the JQ is the bloodbath in the Middle East, I believe we’re at over 1 million dead and untold numbers of refugees. Who is responsible for this ‘Mexicans’? You let them in any organization and it will be corrupted, let team brown have them. Better on the outside then inside putting it in your back.

        I’m actually not quite sure what Zman is saying in this article.But trying to get the Jews on our side is the same kind of wishful thinking as Conservative Inc. trying to get the Latinos on their side. It’s simply not going to happen.After thousands of years of being on nobody’s side but their own, they’re suddenly going to be on OUR side? Ah, castles in the sky.If we want our history to last as long as theirs, if we want our children to stand in the shade of that tree that the Zman is always talking about, we will have to be completely separate from them.

            “After thousands of years of being on nobody’s side but their own, they’re suddenly going to be on OUR side?”
Nobody’s said this. Everyone’s on their own side. If Jews being on their own side is incompatible with membership in what’s becoming Team Brown, then what?

Who GAF?  The Jews can figure it out for themselves; their future is their own concern.  My concern is solely with Western Civilization a/k/a Christendom.   Everyone being on his own side means White Europeans of Christian heritage looking out for other White Europeans of Christian heritage, not wondering where Schlomo will find his next political home.

        This sounds like wishful thinking to me.  The neocons are still having their way.  We are still in Syria, the Middle East wars are still expanding, only in a cryptic way.  If the left mishandled the Jews, I’ll bet you the army would be there to correct it.  Just look at the mass media and the weird symbolic/esoteric stuff we are aware of, which has grown utterly pervasive.  That’s an indicator of hegemony in my opinion.
This was the protocols of Zion stance 😉

            Whenever a synagogue is attacked by over-eager South African blacks, the ANC quickly cracks down and arrests the perpetrators. This is despite their official anti-Israel stance. FWIW, the same also happens when a mob attacks a mosque. Now compare that with the Boers, and you see who truly has power. Also consider the argument from silence, I’ve read of Indians being attacked by SA blacks, but never the Chinese.

                    The Indian government doesn’t care about its diaspora to the same degree that the PRC does. Attack a Chinese company and you probably get a death squad sent after you. Indians have also been the biggest beneficiaries of BEE, which blacks feel should be theirs alone.

        “There’s no reason why Jews in America could not simply throw in with the white majority.”
Except for the fact that elite Jewish interests mandate the destruction ofWhite civilization, of what Belloc called ‘Christendom.’
Gore Vidal said back in the 80’s in the pages of The Nation that Jews have always served as a Fifth Column in America.  He caught substantial fire for that bit of truthiness.  Jonah Blobberg is to NR as elite Jews are to America; a force of vitiation.

        The breakdown of the post WW2 narrative that this country has been riding on for 80 years is now going into overdrive.As a country of diverse regions and peoples we need an over arching national pageant to serve as the glue to create cohesion. A replacement has not been forthcoming.War has served as a backdrop 3 times, the American Revolution, the Civil War, WW2,War is inevitable, the Jews soured Whites on foreign endeavors with the Gulf War, so now unless China or Russia can be cornered into starting a war, the chances of a domestic one are pretty good. The Jewish century is closing. Of course they know this, all of their media power structures are declining, along with Academia. What a terribly great time to be Alive!

        It has always been interesting to me how many of the older generation “race realists” are so hard on blacks and so easy on jews. Here in the rural South, we have always been realistic about black/white differences, and have more or less lived in peace together. Both as Christian tribes, in a pretty idyllic way. Until the revolutionaries came to help us out….

            I find it interesting that anti-Semites always say this. It’s like a strange form of Tourettes. Anything short of bellowing epithets at Jews elicits the “Why are you so hard on blacks, yet so easy on Jews?” Perhaps it fits in with the anti-Semitic mythology that they have arrived at some super-aware place. It’s like Hindus reaching nirvana.

                    btw there’s no such thing as anti-Semitism, it’s not a thing.  If Jews experience bigotry directed at them solely because of their religion or ethnicity, then what they are experiencing is called “bigotry.”  There is no special little chosen niche that makes one form of prejudicial hatred more valuable than another.  For centuries the Irish were subjected to brutal persecution and outrageous prejudice.  They did not experience “anti-Hibernianism”, they experienced old-fashioned bigotry and race-hatred.
Same difference.

        Read it thrice, still not sure I get it. Is this article a troll, or a very subtle “ironic piece” celebrating the coming political homelessness of the j-men?For example:“The new opposition that is forming up in opposition to Team Brown is explicitly white, as well as nationalist and populist. While it is not explicitly antisemitic…”Oh yes it is.Or:“In a balkanized country, the only way for a tiny minority to survive is to attach to the most powerful tribe. Given the options on Team Brown, Team White is going to look like a better option, assuming the option is open.”“Assuming the option is open.” So is it just a subtle celebration of a coming 110, or is he recommending that attachment?And if he’s recommending that attachment, from whose point of view? He mentioned in a broadcast his grandparents are from Russia. Zman = Zimmerman, Zuckerberg?I just can’t get a read on this one.As for myself, I was a brainwashed junior bugman in high school, and because of the standard pozz-ucation and one Jewish buddy, was probably either philo-semitic or at least semito-neutral.But later I lived in Manhattan for a number of years–and that was the end of that.

        I used to be an rah-rah Israel sort of guy. Crossed US and Israeli flags as avatar, for the pleasure of making the pro-terrorist leftist explode with anger. Then I got a job in finance, where I quickly learned about Jewish attitudes toward whites… Let’s just say that Hillary’s “deplorables” and Biden’s “dregs” are tender and caring compared what your average Wall Street kippa’ed manager feels. A few years of that, and I’m firmly in the “lets add another country to the long list” mode. I have never seen more obnoxious, sociopathic bunch of ingrates. They make the average ghetto black look positively cultivated and thoughtful in comparison. I also keep another list – a list of Jews who have, by their actions and words, distanced themselves from their tribals and sided firmly with civilization, who should be allowed to stay if they so wish (people like Ezra Levant and Robert Spencer). The list is depressingly short.

        “Their embrace of cultural conservatism was a matter of necessity, in order to fit into the Republican coalition.”Exactly.  Neocon Jews and liberal Jews are operating from the same basic premise – further the interests of Jews and Israel. There is no dichotomy.There’s also no real problem in the current situation for Jews.  Rich people are insulated from the wider societal problems, they live in their gated communities and behind the armed guards (and in their 5 *+ hotels and first class+ travel).The Jews will adopt whatever spectrum of political stances are required to keep funnelling money and arms to Israel and to keep other middle east nations weak and divided. Being able to whine about genuine anti-semitism is a feature not a bug.

        A list of Jewish US nationalists here:http://www.xoxohth.com/thread.php?thread_id=4049776&amp;mc=60&amp;forum_id=2Good post by Z Man but I agree with one of the above posters that Jewish hatred of white Christians will prevent them from ever joining a white alliance.The unjust thing is the 20-30% of Jews that are not this way (such as myself) are lumped into the rabidly far leftist majority, and I’d strongly prefer not to be judged in relation to them.If there’s a way – and maybe there is today, with current technology – to judge a person on their individual merits (or leftist demerits), that would be best.

Just like I don’t become Jewish by not being an anti-semite, Jews don’t become Europeans by not hating us. Even if every Jew in the world started working for the salvation of Western civilization, they’d still be Jews.The 21th C. will be the century of the tribes, which is to say the century where white people rediscover their tribal identity, and Jews can only integrate when whites have no tribe.I commiserate with your dilemma, but there you have it. I assume you’re white, so if you really wanted, you could raise your children to become American, but they’d have to renounce their Jewish identity.

                Felix, the Jews who marry Gentiles generally have such a minimal Jewish identity, that, in their raising of the kids, their American identity is utterly dominant, and the Jewish part is at *most* an afterthought, *unless* Grandma is really into Jewish identity.
In the raising of kids (at least within intact families), the role of Grandmas is a factor apparently much overlooked by most analysts.

            My guess is that J*ws who say, “Please let me stay with the whites, I’m not like those crazy left wing J#ws” would often just start up the whole subversive drama over again.  But maybe I’m wrong.M, you ask if there is a way to judge a person on their individual merits.  Here are a few tests of assimilability.  Will an individual J#w accept:• That almost none of their people should be allowed to immigrate here, because most are ethnocentric and anti-white?• The repeal of laws that punish questioning the Holocaust?• The dismantling of the Holocaust studies that poison and traumatize our youth?

                Regression to the mean. If the 20-30% “based” members of various ethnic groups could be discerned from the rest and allowed to stay, 70-80% of their offspring would be indistinguishable from the 70-80% that were expatriated the first time. Outlier’s children are rarely ever outliers themselves, you see this in IQ, athleticism, and political preferences.

        Thoughtful article.Jews are indeed painting themselves into a proverbial corner. We can see it in Europe where they are already looking for new homes.   Not all, just the more perceptive ones who see storm clouds forming on the horizon.In regards to switching sides, It all depends on WHEN they side with us. If it’s early on, then it’s not a issue. If they continue to ride the progressive crazy train to the point it derails and we end up in a civil war and blood is spilled. Well it won’t be pretty for them or anyone else.I am not sanguine about many of them switching,  it’s not because of them being Jewish.  But it may depend on how much of the Po-Mo/Cult Marx kool aid they have drank. If they drank as much as many white progtards have, then they will be hell bent on bringing the apocalypse.And they really don’t care if they get strung up, shot or burned to death as long as they can bring down the house.

        If the left/democrats really do scare the Jews away/kick them out, great. But it means they’re not just crazy, but incredibly stupid, as almost all of their funding comes from a small group of incredibly powerful Jews. I was reading some of  White House staffer Ben Rhodes’ book about his time with Obama, and Obama was butting heads with Rahm Emanuel and David Axelrod about the Palestinians, and someone finally blurted out, “The Arabs are not going to pay for your presidential library!” I also have to respectfully disagree with Dr. Gottfried about the main division among Jews being between Ost/Pale and Western/Hellinized. The real divide is between the Sephardim and Mizrahi on the one hand, and the Ashkenazim on the other. I read a book awhile back by an older Jewish man who talked about how his neighborhood in New York changed when the Ashkenazim drove out the Sephardic and Mizrahi: “There used to be men with great beards in the synagogues who looked like Spanish kings talking about Moses, and now all the rabbis do is talk about sexual hygiene and socialism.” The problem isn’t religious Jews for me; the problem comes with people who just happen to be Jewish or are culturally Jewish (like Jon Stewart) or even just half-Jewish (Tim Wise or Bill Maher).

Yeah, going by what I see in the media and interwebs the most zany leftist Jews are secular Jews or maybe Reform Jews.  Orthodox Jews seem to be sensibly centrist or even conservative.

                RE Orthodox/UltraOrthodox: they are not allies, but not threats either. They hew to Jesus’ teaching to render unto Caesar that which is Caesar’s, and unto God that which is His.Interesting post Zman. I am conflicted on this issue b/c I grew up in an integrated (w/ Jews) environment, and some of my oldest and closest friends are Jewish. They are seeing things turn in ways not to their liking (aka Team Brown) but seem unable to cross the divide, even as they change their once Liberal mindset on things like the 2nd Amendment.This is a very challenging issue. On one hand you have a relatively small but influential group that could very well break our way (and bring the influence they have in the media and finance worlds), but on the other hand if brought this way they could revert back to undermining the effort due to an innate fear/dislike of Heritage America. Time will tell.

                And this was despite the fact that many of the Bolsheviks’ most important leaders were Jews—though Jews who viewed their Jewishness as an incidental artifact of their birth, with no meaning for them either religiously (as they were atheists) or nationally (as they regarded themselves as internationalists). Most famously, when Leon Trotsky was asked what his nationality was, he replied “socialist.”

        Everytime an Alt Boomer like you writes about dark-skinned non-whites (be they Blacks, Hispanis, Arabs, etc) you always do it with ostensible scorn, hostility and even hate. But when it comes to Jews… nothing. (Actually, you morons see them, unironically!, as your fellow whites LOL). You speak about them in neutral, dispassionate terms, coaching your text with inanities and empty cliches (“Jews are not a monolith” is a typical boilerplate). Gosh, this is all so tedious. I’m surprised you didn’t finish tour text with #NotAllJewsAreCommies or #JewsCanBeOurAlliesToo 😂

                    Hey, how do you think it makes women feel?  Jews can vote 80% incorrectly, you say, and that’s fine.  But just let less than 50% women vote wrongly and all women have to be smacked back into the 19th C.  Plus we even give birth to you!  Talk about ingrates, sniff.

                        Slight problem here, Jenny: Jews are 2% of the voting population while women are 50% of the voting population. 100% of Jews and Blacks voting for the left would still be less effective than just 35% of women.

        There’s far more intelligent things to be said in discussion of this highly astute post (Zman, though always astute, has really been on a roll lately), but instead I’ll trot out an old joke, for the benefit of those youngsters who may never have heard it before…“First they came for the blacks, but I didn’t speak out because I wasn’t black.  Then they came for the Jews, but I didn’t speak out, because I wasn’t a Jew.  Then they came for… well actually, now that I think of it, once they got rid of the blacks and the Jews, there were no more problems, so they stopped coming for people.”

        “Jews are the most adaptive people in human history”—- ZMan
That’s been noticed before…
“When Jewish Communism begins to get too ‘hot’, as it has here in the U.S., because of the millions who saw the parade of Jew Communist spies, they slide out of that skin and become Zionists. And when this also gets too hot, then they molt and become ‘anti-communists’ or something else. In the excitement, nobody ever seems tonotice that it is always the same snake.“—- George Lincoln Rockwell

        &gt;”There’s no reason why Jews in America could not simply throw in with the white majority.”Yes, what you suggest that they do is rational, but their hatred for Christianity and for Europeans is far beyond rationality. They’d sooner die, literally, than genuinely embrace us. And if they were going to do that, they’d have done it before one of the other 110 times they got kicked out of white Christian countries. Believe me, I don’t say this because I want it to be true – just the opposite. But we are the fox and they are the scorpion. They can’t help it – it’s their nature.

            I’m afraid so…The other problem is that Jews in America are  becoming dumber, which has been noticed by people like Cochran and Harpending, perhaps too many shiksas…While others, like Vox Day, have noticed that their purported intelligence has been exaggerated, while their clannishness and nepotism accounts for most of their success.My life long experiences with Jews and Jewish business confirms VD’s work…

                Vox’s analysis was a misrepresentation (perhaps unintentional) based on Israeli IQ statistics. It’s generally understood that when discussing Jewish IQ, people mean Ashkenazi IQ – but Vox (perhaps unintentionally) ignored the fact that the majority of the Israeli Jewish population is NOT Ashkenazi, and therefore not comparable to the 90+% Ashkenazi Jewish population in the USA and western Europe.This may also explain why Israeli Jews are much less cucked on race and borders than American/European Jews. Lower IQ, but higher negative ethnocentrism.Of course, I don’t dispute that Jews in America are getting dumber – but everyone in America is getting dumber.

        The problem is that Jewish culture has curdled into a hatred of white christians. Every once and a while, the Ben Shapiro/Daily Wire Crew drop some red pills about how Jewishness is explicitly anti-christian. Andrew Klavan’s biography mentions how his Father would’ve disowned him had he become a christian. A centuries long cultural adaption doesn’t just stop.

            While I’m sure you could apply this to a nontrivial segment of the Jewish population, the astoundingly high intermarriage rate between Jews and white Christians suggests that this isn’t really “Jewish culture”, it’s progressive culture.
In fact, people on the alt-right who like to Name the Jew, actually end up naming half-Jews with surprising regularity. I understand why this is hard for many non-WASP Europeans to grasp, but the Jewish elite and the WASP elite are the same thing.

        I’ve told you this before, but it bears repeating – you were one of the major forces that helped me come over from the conservative/libertarian right to whatever the dissident right is currently calling itself. I’m Jewish, and the guys who fancy themselves Nazis don’t especially bother me. I’m well aware there may be no place for me in the future of the American right, but I’ll support it anyway, in whatever capacity I can.

            They’re not making Nazis like they used to. The two main groups of antisemites today are the internet loudmouth and the alt-right types. The former is harmless, as they are afraid of their own shadow in real life. The latter is really not all that hostile to Jews, just tribal in their own way. Of course, Jews were fine allies with blacks, despite never being able to be black. Politics makes for all sorts of strange alliances.

                Yeah, in online interactions with anti-semites, I find they’re either raving lunatics, which gets dull fast, or very reasonable folks who make points that, even when I disagree, I understand and sympathize. It’s all good. I support Christendom and Whites, online and in real life, in every way I can. I’ve got nothing but contempt for Jews who don’t.

                    Max, I wouldn’t have nothing but contempt for Jews who don’t, seeing as there must be many Jews, and Gentiles, who are ambivalent about such things.I urge handling these ambivalent ones with much *firm* TLC.Generally, you get more with honey than vinegar, unless you’re dealing with real pricks.

                        I had a couple dear Gentile friends IRL who did the heavy lifting moving me over from the right to the alt-right. I’ve managed to pay it forward a few times as well. It’s a delicate, often slow, process. It was for me, and it is for anyone making the leap. I guess I’m using a harsh and broad description here, but I don’t just dismiss people. The Jews I have contempt for are the obnoxious, anti-White leftists – I mean, I have contempt for non-Jewish leftists too, but it *really* grates when it’s Jews.

                    I used to yell, jew, jew, jew, with the best of them, but I realize that was lazy and incorrect  thinking.  I am Anglo Saxon to the bone, but my folk handed over the country without a peep, so who’s fault is that?    The patronizing, busybody New England bluenoses (of impeccable Old Stock) have done more damage to us whites intellectually than the jews ever did.If we want to truly know what went wrong, self-examination is in order instead of looking for scapegoats.  As far as I”m concerned,  jews are welcome in the white coalition, as long as they will accept their place as another European ethnicity, which they overwhelmingly are.  Their internal customs, religion and traditions are their own business.  However, they MUST extend the same courtesy to the other European ethnicities and tendencies.  Let’s be neither pro jewish nor anti jewish, simply jew neutral.  .I refuse to believe that jews have some sort of supernatural power over the rest of us.   Are we Euro Americans nothing more than clueless waifs who happen to be good with tools?   If so, then screw it, I guess we can make a living building stuff for the Third World Johnnies.

It’s like the GOP promoting “conservative” blacks, most of whom voted for Obama, due to tribalism.
You want the Jews to like you, but they care more about their tribe than your values.

                    I completely understand. The problem is a corrupted communication channel. You can’t trust any communication coming through the channel because the channel itself is suspect. Nothing can be done to undo this. My analysis is that, when it comes down to it, what will need to be done, if Whites accept the support of Jews, is that Jewish allies not be entrusted with anything critical, nor with leadership positions. Let the Jews prove themselves useful with works that will not prove fatal to the cause in the case of betrayal. And if they earn some trust, fine, but let Whites keep up defenses against the subversion you identify for a long, long time.

            Go all in.  Алиса Зиновьевна Розенбаум, interestingly anti-conservative / anti-libertarian, has done more for “the right”, whatever that is, than perhaps anyone in the Twentieth Century.  Although  labelled “to the right of Barry Goldwater”, she laid the artistic foundation for liberty and individualism, and the most powerful attack on tyranny … ever.  Both “The Tribe” and Conservative Inc, are fundamentally social metaphysicians and “second handers”, and will not defend a vocal supporter of liberty.  We’re on our own.

            I’m also Jewish. Female. Husband is Jewish. Kids are being raised Jewish.Like you, I have always supported Christendom and Whites, both online and in real life (my beloved father is 100% Anglo-Saxon, so maybe that explains some of my thinking on the issue).Anyway, shortly after reading Zman’s post a couple of days ago, I found myself in the dentist’s chair. The post-appointment conversation, which is invariably political in nature, covered the following topics: Brexit (my husband is English), Brett Kavanaugh, overturning Roe v. Wade, abortion in general, quotas for women and Trump. The dentist took all the approved Leftist positions (#Remain, #believeallsurviviors, #prochoice, #quotas, #impeachtrump) while I firmly but politely advanced the ideals of the Dissident Right on each and every score.As we parted ways, the thought occurred to me (and I couldn’t help but laugh inwardly at the irony of it all) that this blonde-haired Christian dentist from Germany, whose Weltanschauung is completely antithetical to that of anti-Semites like Ed who post here, will gain automatic entry to his team – Team White. I, on the other hand, may or may not find myself homeless.

                Hang in there, Simone.The fact, that such a respected figure as Zman is so tired of these hotheads, should lead you to expect that they’re going about burning key bridges fast enough.

                Ed and those who feel like he does are a cancer. The rest of us should be more vocal about this, I agree.

            I tried to post this last night, but my comment got killed due to an internet outage: there is absolutely a place for you in the Dissident Right. From Lawrence Auster to Paul Gottfried to Ilana Mercer to Nicholas Stix, there have always been Dissident Right Jewish writers. While the restoration of Western Civ must be built around Christianity as the dominant moral code, there is no reason that Jews cannot live as a prosperous minority within our system. The Jews have been a part of the West for over 1000 years now and have made important contributions. Israel is a natural ally in our fight against the Islamic horde, and presents a good example of a country with a border wall and a clear sense of its ethno-cultural identity. I’ve often posed the following questions to the Kevin MacDonald crowd: 1) if Jews are so ethno-centric, then why do they outmarry so often and why do they support Muslim immigration? and 2) if our wars in the ME are due to Israel, then why did we overthrow the only Arab government to have a peace treaty with Israel (Egypt) in favor of the Muslim Brotherhood? I also occasionally point out that Israel was a faithful ally to white-run South Africa long after the US and Europe left that country to the wolves.Keep your head up, you have more friends than you think.

                Thanks – and I love your screen name. Totally agreed re Christianity as the core of the West. Not only because it must be, but because it deserves to be. It is a profound system of morality and faith that has done more good for humanity than virtually any other doctrine.
