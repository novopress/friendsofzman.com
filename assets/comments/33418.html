        If Trump back burners foreign policy ‚Äì good.  Actually DAMN good.  US foreign policy has been an unmitigated disaster for decades.  Rollback regulations, incentivize repatriation of industry, robustly secure and enforce the border and start rounding up and deporting illegals.  That would be a decent start.  Probably a pipe dream though‚Ä¶

            Absolutely‚Ä¶Trump would be very wise to get out of all of these foreign entanglements, for nothing good can come of them for him‚Ä¶The problem is that Trump wasn‚Äôt a wise man last time, so where did this new found wisdom come from?!

            Someone please tell me why ‚Äúincentivize‚Äù?
Where did this come from, the people that start every sentence with ‚ÄúSo..‚Äù, or throw in a random ‚ÄúI know right?‚Äù or ‚Äúif you have any questions just ask myself‚Äù.
WTF??
Previously, it was simply INCENT.  In other words, ‚ÄúWe can incent better performance through profit sharing‚Äù.
Good grief.

                I agree.  To turn the noun ‚Äúincentive‚Äù into a transitive verb ‚Äúincentivize‚Äù sounds just ghastly to people of finer sensibilities and grammar Nazis.
The proper usage for ‚Äúincentivize repatriation of industry‚Äù  would have been ‚Äúprovide incentives for the repatriation of industry‚Äù

                I was in Italy a few months ago, and they use the word ‚Äúallora‚Äù as their version of ‚Äúso‚Äù to start a sentence.  ‚ÄúSo‚Äù, I guess annoying word fillers are universal.
Recently, I have heard ‚Äúcomfortability‚Äù.  Why use one syllable when six will do.
Whenever someone would say ‚Äúright?‚Äù at the end of a sentence, I used to say, ‚ÄúHow would I know if it‚Äôs right, you‚Äôre the one saying it.‚Äù  But I got exhausted from volume.

                    Since we‚Äôre riffing on the street defecators, best begin every sentence with‡§Ö‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§æ(‚Äúaccha‚Äù, the universal filler / agreement word in Hindi) and a sinuous head/neck wiggle. Never fails to charm the ladies.
Derogatory slang for Indian in Hong Kong Cantonese is =ÈòøÂèâ(= ‚ÄúAh Cha‚Äù) because that‚Äôs the regular sound pattern which jumps out from otherwise unintelligible blather. Sadly the younger generation are becoming ever more PC and averse to this kind of usage.

        I hope you are right. Israel and Ukraine are evil, troubled hellholes best left alone. I find troublesome the imperial ambitions over Greenland and to the degree they are real Canada, though. No one voted for Manifest Destiny The Sequel, and suspect these are to divert attention over the promised mass deportations, which are the whole ball of wax. Last go round Trump wasted time on tax cuts, so maybe he learned his capital is limited despite his history of bankruptcies.

            In purely pragmatic terms, there are potential natural resource advantages to pursuing deals with Canada and Greenland.
The main thrust is probably Greenland, because it is a potential vehicle for skirting China‚Äôs dominance in rare earth reserves and processing as well as sidestepping the environmental lunatics in the US that will block renewed rare earth recovery and processing efforts.
The advantage of no international border between Canada and the US with regard to tar sands is pretty obvious. The problem is that most Canadians have the political outlook of Californians.

                    The Canada thing only makes sense if you‚Äôre breaking it up first. We take the oil provinces and let the various tribes of homosexuals and Frenchmen (I repeat myself) carve up the rest into a sort of sex-tourism version of the Balkans.I had never given any thought to Greenland. As someone else pointed out, if we‚Äôre buying it, we don‚Äôt have the money. That‚Äôs like the price of 10 or 12 Ukraine adventures. Maybe the idea is to base the dollar on mineral wealth in a sort of modernized return to the gold standard? Every dollar can be redeemed in a certain amount of rare earth elements?

            Just stopping the flow of money and weapons to Ukraine and Israel would be a great plenty of action. That‚Äôs not a do-nothing. He will be fighting nominal Republicans all the way, plus Democrats wanting to make Trump fail.
Greenland is an awesome idea. Anyone who won‚Äôt self-deport is dropped off in an orange jumpsuit on some ice field in the middle of the island. He‚Äôll have plenty of company ‚Äî that‚Äôs where we will exile all the Democrats.

            I remember when I was a kid the television saying (over maudlin music) that America was obligated to take in and nurse Greenland, like a terminally ill orphan, because we‚Äôd ruined it forever when a bomber crashed at Thule and low-level nuked the place. It was PBS, so Greenland annexation was the official government line, circa 1980.Coverage of Trump‚Äôs Greenland bit‚Äîwhich he‚Äôs been running for many years now‚Äîhasn‚Äôt mentioned this, maybe because media ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know anything‚Äù as Ben Rhodes famously said (but someone could tell them), maybe for the usual partisan reasons (Trump is not allowed to be understood), or maybe because they‚Äôre not free to speak negatively of nuclear things right now and remind the people of the old official line(s).

        I frequently reflect on the situation that Lyndon Johnson found himself in after his landslide win in 1964.  Johnson‚Äôs priority was his Great Society domestic program, but his administration bogged down and eventually collapsed over Vietnam.  (I think that the Great Society programs were, by and large, badly conceived, but theywereJohnson‚Äôspriority.)  Johnson could have pretty much walked away from Vietnam in 1965, blamed the mess on the Kennedy advisors whom he despised, and permit Vietnamese unification.  By 1968 no one would have remembered.If Trump is  smart, he‚Äôll follow the Z-man‚Äôs counsel concentrate on his domestic priorities, and delegate the foreign policy stuff to competent people, which probably means excluding the ‚Äúintelligence community.‚Äù  My concern is that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is easily manipulable and will keep getting into messes that Trump will have to put right.

            Vietnam was supposed to be easy. No American soldier would have set foot there had the regime had any idea what it was in for. I think some folks felt the same way about Ukraine a few short years ago. Perhaps the LBJ analogy is more appropriate for Biden. And in other ways too.

                They expected that the Russian economy would collapse due to sanctions at the same time the Russian military collapsed due to the Ukrainian resistance (which was indeed very formidable in the beginning). Neither happened, and once they did not, which we knew in the first six months or so, it became obvious that this was yet another quagmire for the neocons and others holding 300 year old grudges against the Romanovs.

                    It has been a quagmire for the Russians too. Putin sent in a token force and expected capitulation within days of the SMO. Here we are 3 years later, probably over 100k dead or wounded, the storage yards near empty, parts of Russia being occupied.
The benefits Russia has gained are largely totally unseen, at least if you take their rationale seriously.  The rationale was having NATO on their border and the risk of a NATO invasion.  But if successful, the Ukraine war only prevents that risk. So it will appear to the average Russian that absolutely nothing changed.

Wars almost never work out the way the ruling class hopes or at least what they say publicly.  Given the opening stages of the war (SMO), Putin really believed it. Britain was ruined by a war it started and was on the winning side.

                                    Poland would not have been invaded if not for British (and French) interference.  Britain wanted a war and they got it.Regardless of the relative shape of Britain after 1945 vs America today, Britain would have been in much better shape in 1945 had the war not happened.  They didn‚Äôt even end rationing until well into the 1950s.
Hitler‚Äôs demands for Poland were absolutely reasonable and any other leader would have made the same demands.

Demanding a sovereign country bifurcate itself for the sake of a community on it‚Äôs Eastern border is not reasonable. Hilter was open that he wanted a greater self sufficient Germany that had enough farmland. The plan was always looking East, to conquering and removal of the European peoples that he considered to be non-people.

By that logic neither Poland nor any of the former constituents of the Austro-Hungarian Empire should ever have been granted sovereignty.

                        Had BoJo the Clown (acting on GAE‚Äôs behalf) not disrupted the deal that they had established in Istanbul in March 2022, Russia‚Äôs token force would have led to an acceptable resolution. Since that didn‚Äôt happen, they had to go back to the drawing board, retool and apply the lessons learned to improve their military and it‚Äôs industrial base. Sure they‚Äôve had losses, but look at them rolling now. The most battle hardened military force in the world.Why does no one talk about the debacle this has been for NATO? 8 years they spent building and training the Ukraine army for this conflict only to get completely destroyed in the first 6 months. Their military industrial base has been shown to be wildly inadequate especially after the US destroyed Nordstream exacerbating production issues in the most important EU country. Member states are increasingly divided, rejecting any more money/weapons for the Ukraine project, claiming that it‚Äôs a lost cause. Trump‚Äôs now asking them to increase NATO spending to ridiculous levels, which most won‚Äôt be able to afford. The alliance is on the way out and people still want us to think Russia is the big loser here. No, Europe is the biggest loser by far.

                        Yes. It was the things we discussed, and a number of other elements besides. But threatening to ‚Äòshatter the CIA into a thousand pieces‚Äô, well, things happened quickly after that.
JFK knew it was, and is, a spiritual war. And he knew that the intel establishment ‚Äî mostly Ivy League secret-society types ‚Äî was neither on the side of God nor of traditional America.
The America imposed since ‚Äô63 has been Their America. That was the year of the real coup, and nothing has been the same since.
You had to have been alive back then to appreciate it fully.

        I predict Trump‚Äôs fan club will get the same Trump they had during his original term as grand poohbah ‚Äî a largely ineffectual fella who, at best, barely moves the ball in the direction his supporters would prefer to see it go. The teeth have been removed from the office of the presidency. The technocratic oligarchs at the top have rigged things so well that one guy (ceremoniously dubbed ‚Äúpresident‚Äù) cannot possibly interfere with their machinations. It often feels as if the entire Trump phenomenon is an expertly orchestrated distraction.

        There‚Äôs a video of Trump‚ÄîI think first circulated by Jimmy Dore‚Äîshowing him talking off the cuff, on a stage, about Israel. In the video he expresses his surprise that Netanyahu, despite his assertions, doesn‚Äôt want a deal, while the Palestinians were desperate to take any deal. It really shows how innocent Trump is in some ways.Someone as aggressively online as him is bound to eventually stumble onto one of *those* videos that jump containment at Telegram and end up in compilations on YouTube. You know the ones: IDF soldiers beating up Palestinians in wheelchairs or confused kids with Downs-Syndrome; telling people to come out with their hands up, then shooting them down and laughing after they fall; there‚Äôs even a trend with Israeli soldiers where they time buildings to explode in the background while they propose marriage to their girls back home, a sort of ‚Äúfireworks‚Äù display.The craziest part of all this is that same Jewish-Americans who go nuts over the Proud Boys or the Klan (do they even still exist?) refuse to see the irony. The other day I saw a movie about the white separatist group,The Order, starring Jude Law. It was a relatively good, evenhanded picture, but when I left the theater I could only shake my head. ‚ÄúThese guys were basically pikers compared to the Mossad or Irgun. They killed like five people over the course of several years in their quest to create an ethnostate. Israel‚Äôs killed forty-thousand not to get an ethnostate, but just because they can‚Äôt stand the stink of their neighbors.‚ÄùThe best strategy to turn Trump on the issue is the same one as always: go for the ego. Someone in media is obviously seeding the news with ‚Äúreports‚Äù (re: made-up b.s.) about Musk being the decisionmaker behind the scenes. The goal is obviously to drive a wedge between Trump and Musk (which, incidentally is fine with me.) Someone should try getting ‚ÄúBibi‚Äôs Bitch,‚Äù out there into the public sphere, since not only does it have that plosive alliteration, but it‚Äôs a wedge that definitely needs to be driven.

        Hrrrrmmmmm‚Ä¶.There‚Äôs a lot of truth there‚Ä¶ and not disagreeing with any of it‚Ä¶ but one has to look beyond Blumpf when making predictions about this kind of stuff. You have to look at what the bad guys are doing too. While it is true that they are going to continue to call the shots on some things‚Ä¶ they are in very, very deep trouble. Right now all they can do is continue to throw sand and monkey wrenches into the works in hopes of turning the Dirt People against Trump. They are doing that with gay abandon because it always worked in the past. The problem is that people are seeing that too.The times have changed. The left has now gone unstable and everyone knows it. Biden alienated the shite out of the electorate by pardoning his son and every mass murderer on death row. He did it again when he handed out presidential medals to his fart suckers like Soros, Hillary, Satan and I think Cornelius Rye got one too. The billions for the Kraine and Israel stuck in the craw of people caught in the floods and fires. Gavin Newsom is as popular as Justin Turdo in his own shitlib state. He has to try to appear statesmanlike while his vibrant and diverse cohorts in the fire department give the finger to the people that rely on them and voted for them.No salesman can succeed if the team supporting him are all clowns. We are reaching an inflection point in the west. As we slide into the abyss ‚Äì the people responsible are going to be driven out and slowly replaced ‚Äì or there will be a bloody, nasty revolution and then they will be replaced. Trump‚Äôs team has already ‚Äòset the tone‚Äô promising oversight, hirings, firings and replacement of the defective cogs in the establishment regime. Turdo has been turfed in Canada. Macron, Starmer, and whoever the current goof in Germany is ‚Äì are all on the verge of being swept away too. The cloud people are ALL on very, very thin ice. We saw this when Elon said he will so replace you with street shitting pajeets and f*** you if you don‚Äôt like it.Afghanistan and its disastrous conclusion went away. The argument that the Kraine and the Israeli war need to go away too is an incredibly powerful one. I am seeing growing evidence that parties are starting to matter less and less ‚Äì people are in so much trouble now that they have to actually look at the problems, see results ‚Äì or else. The media no longer controls public opinion and all they can do is push retarded narratives.The pendulum is starting to swing. I don‚Äôt see Trump in front of it‚Ä¶ I see him positioning himself behind it. Some good things may start to happen soon.

        Mass deportations and confirmations are the focus.  Trump has zero leverage on Russia short of a deal that creates a team-up with them to hang the people responsible for that debacle.  There is value in getting some daylight between Russia and China.  On Israel, the public has voted: stay out of it.  I would not be surprised to hear he wants an Egypt-Israel styled peace treaty with Iran.  Those take time, but it would largely end the fighting over there.Greenland is Alaska-east.  Odds are good that it sits on massive energy deposits.  We‚Äôre not buying Greenland for the views.  Trump is after the liquid gold.He‚Äôs been very quiet about Lawfare.  Something is being planned, I think.Getting the military out of the ditch is important, too.On the economy: tariffs! Tariffs for everybody!

            ‚ÄúOn the economy: tariffs! Tariffs for everybody!‚Äù
I was with you right up until your last sentence. Calling for tariffs is worse than calling for pirates. At least  the pirates will spend the booty on piratey things. Give the money to government, they will import more foreigners, and entangle us further in foreign affairs.
Ya gotta starve the beast. Feeding him is a terrible idea.

                The purpose of tariffs is not raising revenue.  The purpose is to make our producers competitive with foreign producers.  Sadly, I don‚Äôt think it will work. We‚Äôve had 55 years of pogroms on the productive economy.  Undoing it will not be easy or accomplished in 4 years.

                    Tariffs can‚Äôt do that. All it can do is impoverish Americans, and at the same time, raise money for the guys who import our replacements and interfere globally.
If your goal is to make American products competitive, a far better idea would be decriminalizing the stealing of foreign goods. Won‚Äôt take merchants very long to stop carrying anything foreign, and we haven‚Äôt enriched our oppressor

                        Legalizing stealing might have some unexpected consequences, don‚Äôt you think?
Americans have been brainwashed on tariffs, in part because that Walmart cheap gene we seem to have installed. All sane countries who value their sovereignty and economy have tariffs. And yes, people have to pay more money for stuff. It‚Äôs okay, we just need to take deep breaths. They also have jobs with which to the pay the money.

                            Of course there will be consequences. There are no solutions, only tradeoffs.
Walmart will stop selling foreign goods, so before long there won‚Äôt be anything to steal. Amazon would have to quit importing, since employees could just have friends back up to the dock doors. Etc.
The tradeoff is a temporary, self-correcting boon to Jonquarius vs. a permanent wealth transfer to the guys persecuting the J6ers. and hiring another 86,000 IRS agents, andbuilding fusion centers to track our every move and expense.

        Trump wasted his political capital on tax cuts as well the last time around. I think that he realizes that was a mistake as tax cuts weren‚Äôt a big issue. Trump wants to go down in the history books. That‚Äôs not going to happen with another tax cut.
Immigration reform and Greenland would do the trick.

                    Nope. We‚Äôre screwed with the debt. If you raise taxes or cut spending enough to really dent the deficit, you‚Äôd cause a recession, which would lower GDP and thus, ironically, make the debt to GDP situation even worse.
We‚Äôve seen this before. At some point, there‚Äôs no normal way out. You have to have inflation combined with low rates.

                        Exactly.  I expect more circular adjustments to make the official inflation lies even greater.  In the 1990s they installed three into the formulas: substitution effect, calling part of inflation technological improvement, and substituting housing costs with rent estimates.  Coincidentally, these all lower the official inflation figures.  If we were still using the formulas from Carter‚Äôs era, Biden would have much higher figures, as anyone who goes to the grocery store already knows.

                            I have no idea how they‚Äôll do it, but inflation combined with very low interest rates is the easiest way out of this.
Theoretically, Congress could come up with a deal where the US very slowly raises taxes and cuts spending to address the deficits w/o tanking the economy. It would take a decade or more of sound policy and everyone working together.
That won‚Äôt happen. Defaulting on the debt is simply impossible, so you‚Äôre left with inflation and financial repression. It‚Äôs been done before. It‚Äôs not anything new. It can ‚Äì and will be ‚Äì done.

                            Don‚Äôt forget hedonic adjustment and geometric weighting.  That substitution is a killer too.  It turns a measure of inflation into a measure of surviving.  Actual examples of substitution in the inflation numbers are steak and hotdogs.  If you have to buy hotdogs because steak went up too much, you are experiencing a large drop in standard of living.Hedonic adjustments have been used to take an item that has gone up and price and adjusted to that over at the BLS, the price actually fell.It‚Äôs not just inflation. It‚Äôs GDP. It‚Äôs unemployment. It‚Äôs productivity.  Every number the BLS comes out with is pure fantasy.  It‚Äôs more of a psyop than meaningful statistics. All are used to manage expectations.

                        It could be avoided but I don‚Äôt expect it to. Shutting down government offices wholesale would be a short-term disruption, but not nearly as deep as most think. Overpaid government workers are a major cause of high-priced housing. Government office buildings are a major cause of high-priced commercial RE. And economically speaking, most produce not goods, but bads.
So long as they didn‚Äôt do something stupid to extend the amount of time the ex-government workers could afford to stay home on the couch, those people will have to get jobs producing something of value to society, for a change.

                            Unfortunately, when you cut a government bureaucracy, they will then concentrate the cuts in the most public facing way.
Like if your school board gets a cut, they aren‚Äôt going to clean out the local BOE, they‚Äôre going to fire teachers, cut or eliminate extracurricular activities, not buy new books and other supplies etc.
Whatever public-facing benefits any bureaucracy happens to create are the very first things that bureaucracy will cut.  The primary purpose of any bureaucracy, be it public or private is to protect itself from cuts and expand its budget and scope.

            Tax cuts will happen because republicans are in power and that‚Äôs what republicans do. However, it‚Äôs probably not going to involve the expenditure of much political capital. More likely (if Trump has any sense at all), he‚Äôll make the country club republicans expend capital with him to get those cuts. I imagine that deal has already been made. I‚Äôm sure the legislation is already teed up and ready to go.

            The real problem with tax cuts is they almost never impact the base very much. They tend to be tarted up with giveaways to rich people who are overpaying their local political games, and refundable credits to encourage welfare people to pop out more kids.
And while corporate cuts on paper would be good for Americans, supply/demand won‚Äôt readjust with all the current barriers to entry. You need new, entrepreneurial producers, which the admin state will not allow. And the existing corps like Disney will keep working around the rules with their foreign workers programs.

                America had a much better economy under ‚Äúdraconian‚Äù tax rates.  I‚Äôm not saying those high tax rates caused the better economy, but it falsifies the idea that taxes cripple the economy.A lot of money was spent on plant and equipment in that era because it was all tax deductible.  Nobody actually paid the high rates.  We were the most economically powerful country in the world. In many categories we produced more than 50% of the world‚Äôs production.    We were also the largest creditor nation ever (we‚Äôre now the biggest debtor ever) earning vast income streams from that credit extended to foreigners.There were other reasons, especially in the post war era, but the idea that taxes burden an economy and makes you less productive is poppycock, at least in comparison to neoliberalism.  All the people who drone on about giving more tax cuts to the rich completely ignore just how damaging the MIC/Empire is to the US economy.  They entirely ignore the horrific cost of maintaining the bureaucratic state and all the laws in employment which make employing somebody so risky.  They ignore that it takes 10 years to build a new factory in most locales in America or 10 years to open a mine.Of course, they will never name a tax rate. It‚Äôs always just ‚Äúlower!‚Äù  If the taxes were 1/2 the rate they are now, they‚Äôd still be claiming the taxes are too high and they need to be lowered.

                    I‚Äôm not saying lower is always better. Obviously, the ‚Äúcapital gains‚Äù crap came along to deal with changes to tax law. While it used to be a good investment strategy was to buy blue chips and cash (or reinvest) the dividends, tax policy gave us the ephemeral and usually imaginary valuations that pumped up stock options.
But the other thing to keep in  mind is that when taxes go up, that money goes to the guys who are keeping the wars going and importing our replacements. That‚Äôs not a winning strategy for our side.

        With regards to Israel, anything Trump tries to not do will be met with instant resistance, not just from Dems, not just from the media, not just from his own party (ahem), but from his cabinet as well. We all know the tail wags the dog here. We just saw how Congress shamefully jumped into action to shame the ICC for calling a war criminal a war criminal. Nothing has changed on that front. He can‚Äôt just punt on this.He also, obviously, cannot focus on fairy tales from the media (Russiagate, piss tape), sob stories (kids in cages, Muslim people stranded at airport), and tax cuts. The fact that he went to social media last night to whine about the ineffectual loser Jack Smith and his fake, vindicative, irrelevant report tells me that he is still far too concerned about what the Establishment thinks and says about him. Of course, he‚Äôs Trump. He is 78. He‚Äôs not going to change.

        Is it correct that Trump can do nothing on Ukraine for 100 days?  I would see that as ideal, but the Clown Prince of Kiev is going to be asking for another handout before then. A large percentage of Congressional Republicans are going to want to give him another blank check.  Hopefully this has already been worked out with the leadership and they have been told they have to put him off for now.  Would he veto an aid bill after a neocon created media crisis?  Let‚Äôs hope so.

            The American bankers and military contractors got paid last year, so the pressure for new money will be far less now. Unless Trump asks Congress for Ukraine money, Johnson will not do anything. Biden sent billions in the last month, so that works in Trump‚Äôs favor, oddly enough. He can just point to that money when Zelensky demands more money.My sense is Kellogg made the rounds and learned that Ukraine is in deep trouble and there is nothing that can be done to change it. He also seems to have learned that Zelensky will never do a deal with Russia and Russia is not interested in talking to him anyway. The neocons created an situation that cannot be resolved at the bargaining table. They did this on purpose, on the assumption that it would force NATO to enter the war. That turned out to be a false assumption.The only good option for Trump is to blame Biden and the Europeans for creating this mess and simply refuse to participate in it further.

                Yeah, I saw the 100 days as a way to simply let the situation unfold. The Russians are obviously in the final stage of grinding down the Ukranian military. Waiting 100 days allows the outcome to be even more clear.
The Trump team offers to negotiate. The Ukrainians refuse. Trump says, ‚ÄúWell, I tried, but the Ukrainians won‚Äôt come to the table. Europe, you handle this.‚Äù

                    If Trump tells the Ukes and Euros the jig is up and the money/weapons supply is done, they can take it from there and get the best deal from Russia they can (it won‚Äôt be much). It is the US money and weapons that are keeping this fiasco going.

                Reports are emerging that the Ukrainians are selling Western weapons on the open market, including to the Latin American narcotics cartels. I suspect this has been the case from the start, but the significance of the stories becoming more prominent is to lay the groundwork for cutting off funds. Propaganda has to be understood and appreciated in our Soviet-style system, and as a guide for what is planned. Watch in the days ahead for more reports of distinctly European weapon systems recovered from firefights on the southern border.

        No matter how much he wishes to avoid, the events will draw him to the international front. If missives start flying over us bases in ME thanks to netanyahoo, he will have to either have to start shooting or bring them home. In Ukraine, he will be shocked to find how many us soldiers are directly involved in the war and will need to make a decision to shut down operation and that will make the front collapse. Then there is this Houthi business of shutting down all ocean trade, ‚Äúchina-china-china‚Äù aligned with ‚ÄúRussia-Russia-Russia‚Äù, and whichever other pot Biden is leaving broken.

We have been shooting for the last thirty-five years.  Let‚Äôs try something different.
If we can let the Somalis get away with dragging Ranger corpses through Mogidishu, and let the Taliban humiliate us in Afghanistan, I don‚Äôt think removing troops from Syria and Ukraine will be any worse.  It will probably be salubrious to remove the troops of our own volition rather than withdraw them things have become untenable [again].

        Reading Sundance‚Äôs analysis of Trump‚Äôs Cabinet picks at Conservative Treehouse, I‚Äôm going to disagree with all the naysayers declaring this iteration as another marionette show.
I think Trump is gearing up to do exactly as the Zman predicts: he‚Äôll merely make noise towards the neocon agenda while attempting a major shakeup of our ossified domestic DC bureaus.

        Trump‚Äôs instincts are to stay out of foreign entanglements, but he has made commitments. His natsec appointments are generally very hawkish, and it remains to be seen how resolute he will be in the face of the ‚Äúprovocations‚Äù which are certain to come.
Trump dislikes both Netanyahu and Zelenskyy on a personal level, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean he disagrees on policy. Again, we shall see.

        Ukraine has been designed as a forever war. That bunch of neocon lunatics will simply wait Trump out.
I think there is a significant chance Trump can be duped into an Iran war by the usual suspects. I suspect we will see a big push for this from Bibi.
He probably figures his time is getting short since he is nearly as old as Trump and he does have his own legal issues at home.
