        I completely agree that Cofnas is a sophist who cares nothing for the truth and keeps making the same arguments while ignoring my counterarguments. But re group selection: My perspective is cultural group selection. It’s not important to get into how it works genetically. From my review of Joseph Henrich’s WEIRDest People in the world: Without mentioning cultural group selection, Henrich describes social norms as “arising directly from cultural learning and social interaction, that is via culturalevolution” (p. 69). Within the group, reputation is important; people with a badreputation may be penalized, exiled, or even murdered — essentiallyacknowledging that human groups become, like a military unit, vehicles ofselection because they are able to police group membership by expellingcheaters who accept the benefits of group membership without paying the costs.Groups with better norms, especially the ability to inculcate high levels ofintragroup dependence and cooperation, are able to prosper by growing faster,and this has genetic consequences. “Wherever we look, from the Arctic toAustralia, hunter-gatherer populations compete, and those with the bestcombinations of institutions and technologies expand and gradually replace orassimilate those with less effective cultural packages”; e.g., the Inuit replaced the“fragmented and isolated communities that had lived there for millennia” (p. 80).The relevance to the expansion of the West after 1500 is obvious.http://www.kevinmacdonald.net/HenrichReview.pdfThis is my approach to Judaism, as presented in my first book: The culture of ethnic separation, promoting marriages of high IQ people, within-group altruism, enforcing penalties for Jews who violated community norms (which likely selected for ethnocentrism), etc. They developed a culture that had evolutionary advantages (at times Jewish population growth has far exceeded non-Jewish, as in 19th-century Russia; but, as the history of anti-Semitism shows, there are serious disadvantages as well).  There are obviously genetic payoffs for groups with successful strategies, as Henrich’s comment shows. But Jews are also highly ethnocentric, as you seem to agree.I rather doubt that my use of the word ‘strategy’ was a trigger. The first book got good reviews. What triggered people is that I discussed conflicts of interest between Jews and Europeans, Jews as a substantial part of the post-WWII elite in America, Jewish influence on culture, immigration, multiculturalism, etc. Anyone who takes a less than positive view of Jewish influence will certainly trigger a lot of people. And yes, Jewish cultural influence has been an evolutionary (genetic) disaster for European peoples.

        —Max Planck famously said, “Science advances one funeral at a time”
Given the era that Planck lived in, this was astute. But at some point, I’d say that “Science regresses one funeral at a time” is a better statement since about the 1960s. When biological science is anchored by equality and equity, it can’t advance any further, and it corrupts other field of science in its wake.

        This very contentious topic again. I will start by admitting that I may be biased. I have had quite close contact with members from this community over the years, and had/continue to have many strong relationships.Of course, there are always individuals, but there are group dynamics too. It is hard to argue against what one sees going down the list of the Biden White House cabinet. Or looking at the credits on Hollywood films (or TV shows). Or the influence of the ADL. It’s likely that the people I’m acquainted with are already pre-disposed to be more “like us”, and not representative of the larger community whom we may not interact with (and may not interact with us).It’s good to be aware of other groups, but I also don’t think that we should simply be blaming others for all of our own issues. Even if somebody tells you to drink poison, you still have to be aware enough to say no. We need to be aware enough of the influences being pushed on us from society, to at least recognize and reject them. I believe this is starting to happen in some corners of “the right”. This will be a decades long project, though.Regardless of what other groups do, I stay focused on my own. Our people have adopted a hyper individualistic mindset with no in-group preference. Our people have rejected their own religious heritage. I don’t claim to know all the answers to our problems, but we can start by taking control of the things we can control. Children, friends, business, etc. Just be aware of who is part of your group and who is not.

            “We need to be aware enough of the influences being pushed on us from society, to at least recognize and reject them. I believe this is starting to happen in some corners of “the right”. This will be a decades long project, though.”I am mildly white-pilled on the long game.  Ultimately, those who easily succumb and are most bought-in to the degeneracy being peddled will have few or no children.I think of my oldest son, 11 years old, and his buddies at his Catholic school.  They are far more sheltered and naive about things than I was 30 years ago at the same age in public school.  There aren’t subversive “family” sitcoms and other tv shows widely watched like there were 30 years ago.  His media consumption focuses on fishing videos, not pop culture garbage.  It wasn’t an option 30 years ago to select media narrowly focused on your interests, which has the effect of avoiding the mass media programming.  Just about all the families he associates with are traditional nuclear families, with probably an average family size of 3 kids.  30 years ago in public school, I was in the minority not having divorced parents.And not that Catholic schools are perfect, there are some shitlib teachers and the admins can be lacking, but perhaps by selection bias, the types of families that put their kids in those schools force minimized pozzing.To summarize, the whites actually having many children are typically shielding them from the poz, and living as traditional nuclear families.  They’ll inherit the future.  Those embracing degeneracy are facing an evolutionary dead-end.

I am too, reasonably, but my gut feeling is like a weight is off of me. At the risk of sounding woo-woo, the spirit moves before its effects are seen, and it’s been a long time since I had a good feeling like this. Give it a few years.

                I share your optimism. There are lots of positive trends going on. I also agree that the worst cultural damage (90s as you mentioned) is behind us.The circumcision rate is apparently dropping alot in Canada (now below 30% of babies), and hopefully the same is happening in the States. Another positive trend 🙂That said, it’s not as simple as outbreeding the libs. Your kid may have a nice time growing up, but the left wing brainwashing is certainly going to be shoved at him in university. Maybe your son withstands it, but does your daughter? That is just one of many challenges.

        It’s my understanding that— having evolved for hundreds of thousands of years in hunter-gatherer groups consisting of our extended family and their spouses— that *all humans* have ethnocentrism and a special affinity for the members our particular tribe encoded in our genes.Only in the past 10-15,000 years have we lived in cities composed of various unrelated groups. So the necessity of learning to co-exist with unrelated others— and the selection for the genes which make that possible— is a relatively recent phenomenon.And of course evolution— which can be understood to as humans’ ongoing ability to adapt to our ever-more-rapidly changing environment— is still happening.And it makes sense that while most human groups have reacted to modernity by becoming less ethnocentric and more open to the presence and ideas of other groups, and thus ‘watering down’ of their identities which thid process entails— Jews as a group have adopted a different strategy; that of substituting the physical proximity of their fellow tribesmen by cultivating an increased sense of tribal identity;  which includes all the factors MacDonald points out.And in woke George Floyd America, where every other human group is encouraged to celebrate their particular identity, whites are expressly forbidden from doing so: a condition which the mainstream media— in which Jews are disproportionately represented— clearly both encourages and enforces.Could it be that Jews see this trend of diminishing white identity as one which weakens their competitors for predominance in society— straight white male WASPs— and are therefore deliberately promulgating it?

            The models are pretty clear. Jews cannot be the engine of the world by themselves (not enough of them and they lack important traits necessary to make things work at the most basic levels). Therefore, stalling out the world’s engine is a death sentence ultimately. A parasite cannot persist if it kills off the host. But nothing will really change until a serious collapse forces normie off the couch. And until that occurs, its best to focus on yourself (and family/friends) in order to survive the interregnum following collapse. That is no easy task. You can’t freelance it at the last second and hope to make to the other side.

        I think MacDonald’s thesis is at least approximately true, but it’s unnecessary. It doesn’t take a three-volume evolutionary-psychological treatise to understand how the Jews became all that they are. Just have a glance at them through the lens of the great Jewish miracle: compound interest.
Even the smallest IQ advantage combined with the slightest in-group preference will, over time, produce great “overrepresentation”—or, as it’s traditionally called, victory.
Most cultures throughout recorded history have understood usury to be a crime, an injustice, or an outright evil.
That’s enough.

        It is not about genetic group evolution, but about cultural group evolution. This happens for every group that has survived, but it’s especially extreme for Jews, because of having lived in the middle of hostile populations.So the Jews have developed cultural adaptations, like being hostile to Christianity and traditional European culture. Every Jew that was not hostile has ended up mixing with gentiles and disappearing among the general population. The ancestors of Saint Therese and Saint John of the Cross were Jews that converted and it doesn’t get more Catholic than that.People that stay Jews are the ones that have an individual genetic predisposition to ethnocentrism (and other behaviors) and a cultural group predisposition against Christianity (and other behaviors)

            This is why so many people, particularly in Eastern Europe, have a small percentage of Jewish genes. The Jews who enjoyed being around the locals peeled off and blended in, adding a small bit to the larger gene pool.

            By and large, the populations were not hostile, at least initially. The script played out repeatedly in the olden times. Jews would be welcomed into a Kingdom or Emirate, usually to play their role in banking because both Christianity and Islam banned usury, while Judaism did not. Later, for reasons that are impossible to explain, they would be expelled. Must be antisemitism.

            ” having lived in the middle of hostile populations.”
Might be better written as
” having inserted themselves into the middle of hostile populations.”
because that raises the question of “Why do they do that?”

        It’s an unmooring. Apollonians and Mercurians, as Z has mentioned before, is a useful way of looking at it.Jews are a diaspora, so they’re exemplary of the unmooring, and because they’re powerful and successful, they draw ire. If gypsies or Bedouins were as successful and powerful, they’d take the heat instead.The ire isn’t mere jealousy or scapegoating, either. Unsettled people are disruptive to settled societies. It’s a rightful ire.Speaking as an American, the worst part is watching Americans being scattered, becoming Mercurians after so much effort and bloodshed establishing ourselves, to the point where few question the ‘nation of immigrants’ garbage rhetoric.

            From what I can tell, the Irish use “Tommy” as a slur of the English.Ironically enough, the most important story about the Irish in forever just snuck under the radar this weekend [it was dumped on a Friday afternoon, when no one was paying any attention]:Mobster Whitey Bulger’s nephew visited the WHITE HOUSE while Biden was vice president: Hunter’s associate who concocted China deals met with top aidehttps://freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/4144212/posts===============It turns out that, all along, Hunter Biden had been in bed with the Bulger family Irish Crime Syndicate.For those of you who are cinephiles, the role of Whitey Bulger was played by Jack Nicholson in Martin Scorcese’s “The Departed”, and the role of Robert Mueller was played by Matt Damon.I had always thought that Whitey Bulger was assassinated in 2018 by the federal Bureau of Prisons because the Deep State needed to prevent Bulger from testifying against them in the Russiagate psy-op [Robert Mueller having been Bulger’s boss throughout the 1980s in Massachusetts].It never dawned on me that the Deep State also needed to protect Joe Biden for the 2020 election.So by assassinating Bulger, the Deep State killed two birds with one stone: They preserved the Russiagate hoax, and they preserved the Biden presidential candidacy hoax.===============!!! SPOILER ALERT !!!I also continue to be fascinated as to how much of our recent political history comes straight out of cinema; e.g. the MRNA v@xxine-apocalypse perfectly mirroring the “Aschen” episodes of Stargate SG1, and the assassination of Whitey Bulger [Jack Nicholson] by the Deep State perfectly mirroring Matt Damon’s onscreen execution of Jack Nicholson.===============BTW, Biden’s leprechaun roots are back in the news again today.Joe Biden’s Ballina cousin Joe Blewitt ‘buzzing’ for US President’s visit next weekhttps://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/4145033/posts“Joe Biden’s cousin Joe Blewitt from Mayo said the family is ‘thrilled’ that the US President has finally confirmed he will be coming ‘home’ to Mayo next week.”===============If you look at Mayo on the map, it’s way the heck out on the West Coast of Ireland, just about exactly where those ship-wrecked Spaniards would have been swimming ashore after the armada sank.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_MayoDo you suppose Tater Joe is simply projecting when he casts aspersions upon the Black Irish?

        Cofnas’ BS is particularly infuriating, because he almost certainly knows better, and better men than him, even many Jews, have admitted that Jews are at least partially responsible for anti-Semitic attitudes. Stephen Steinlight has written eloquently about the anti-gentile attitudes he imbibed from his family and friends, and how that he believes this adversely affects relations between Jews and others. Jerome Weidman, the author and Broadway playwright, talked about Jewish arrogance and “Anti-Gentilism” in his book “I can get it for you Wholesale”, and how this was bad for both Jews and Gentiles, and the country as a whole. Mordecai Richler, in his book “The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz” painted a picture of a young Jew on the make that would have elicited shrieks about Anti-Semitism, had it not been written by a Jew. And of course, there’s always Norm Finklestein. But to listen to Cofnas, Jews, alone, utter alone among races or ethnic groups, never did anything that might have pissed anyone off, never favored their own, never discriminated or exploited or harmed, never held a grudge,  dindu nuffin, in fact.The most hardcore 14/88 Whitopia TRS KKK Daily Stormer white nationalist never held a more unrealistic view of his race than Cofnas has of his. What a crock.

            Z: “His use of the word “strategy” to describe his theory may be technically accurate…”
If 1500 years or more of Hebrew Day School [in foreign nations] spent studying &amp; memorizing the dictates of the Talmud are NOT a “strategy”, then the word “strategy” is meaningless.
The Talmud is the UR-STRATEGY.
To the best of muh knowledge, no other race of humans ever had anything even remotely resembling the Talmud.
[I supose it’s possible that e.g. the Brahmin of the Hindu race might have something akin to a “Talmud”, but, if so, they’re been very quiet about it.]

                    The Talmud was written by the worst elements amongst the Jews — those who remained in Babylon when Zerubbabel, Joshua and Co. headed back to Jerusalem to build the second temple . . . the temple in which Christ the King taught and preached.
So, the most cowardly, materialistic, and anti-God elements are the folks who began to write the Talmud, along with their Babylonian buddies who doubtless put their own stamp of occultism on the documents.
Didn’t need Jevovah nupe, all us rabbis are far more clever and will make up a Pentateuch for ourselves!  Won’t that be convenient!

                He got laughed at for his assertion.  Then he made a horse’s ass of himself by complaining about the laughter.

One should really hunt that video up and watch it if they haven’t seen.The jewish concentration in finance plays a huge role in the huge role of Jews in tech and science.  Finding themselves sitting on big piles of money they eagerly buy up promising technology.  I find myself looking into the  owners or CEOs of key communication nodes or tech.  Google, Duckduckgo, 23andMe…  JJJ and more Js.  Bill Gates and Elon? Only God knows what they got on them. It’s presumably vile.  Not sure how Elon found the time to design rockets.

It was so hot Whitney Webb just dumped the entire call on the internet.  As i listened I could feel the psychic wince emanating from Jews around the world.  Not gonna lie, it sorta aroused me.

        Just yesterday, a story about something Bill Maher was saying, with a picture of him, showed up in my homepage feed. And I got to looking at his nose. Never really noticed before. So I did an Early Life check, and what to do you knowSomething that’s been in the back of my mind for longer is that the last 4 US treasury secretaries (not counting the acting ones who held the job for a week or two) were all members of the tribe. Counting the acting ones, it’s 6 or 7 out of the last 8. Looking at Democrats only, their last 6 treasury secretaries in a row. Until recently, they held the Fed chair for 31 consecutive years, 3 different occupants.2.4% of the population, wiki tells me. Figure the odds.

        It is hard to account for the over- representation (verging on  complete dominance) in media, in particular, without a “strategy”. Is control of information choke points coincidence or cohencidence? Nepotism is the method, certainly, but is it the motive?
I approach MacDonald’s theory the same way I do quantum physics. I may not understand exactly why it works, but it does.
At least it accounts for the appearances. Then again, so does Ptolemaic astronomy.

        It’s all in the Bible. Jacob (renamed Israel) means “supplanter”:Genesis 27:34And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.35 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.36 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?37 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?38 And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.39 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.

        “Blazingly obvious.” Many of us here read a frequent contributor’s blog where he’s prone to employ a much more colorful adverbial phrase. 😎[European] Jewry are among the most intelligent. Going back centuries if not millienia too, they developed skills to survive and, when possible, to prosper as guests in host countries/cultures that were alien. They surely have no claims to being an insular group. Gypsies and Travelers exit, as do probably many more I’ve never heard of. What sets the Jew apart was (is) that, even as a hated outsider, he often had skills essential to his hosts: banker, negotiator, skilled craftsman, educator, and so forth. As to their tendency to “take over,” maybe deliberate, maybe not. From my vantage point, in-group preference explains a lot. For example, let’s accept that they seem to dominate non-cognitive niches whether it be pornography or owning sportsball teams. A lot of that would seem to be explciable simply the need to send the less-talented children somewhere. Not every Hebrew is cut out to be a doctor, a lawyer or a top political scientist. Better to set up Shmuel or Heidi with a business he/she can manage, even one that doesn’t confer the highest social status. And the fact that they gravitate to being insiders with close ties to the powers that be (when they AREN’T the very powers themselves) greatly facilitates setting up the less talented relatives in their prospective niches.None of the above is to say that conspiracies never exist; only to say that rational clan behavior, survival mechanisms if you will, explains a lot.

        Having read the Culture of Critique trilogy with an open mind, I don’t think KMac is arguing in good faith.  There may be holes in Cofnas’s arguments(I wouldn’t know) but MacDonald is the most brazen intellectual base-stealer of them all. His general argumentation tactic is to take a reasonable and obviously true claim – “Jews practice ingroup favoritism(who doesn’t?)”, or “Group identity is important” and prove it.  Then, he uses this reasonable claim to leapfrog to an extreme and unsupported assertion, like “Jews intentionally tricked Europeans into committing racial suicide”.  Then, when criticized or challenged, he retreats to the less extreme claim and pretends that was all he was saying.I recently reread CofC’s chapter in Jewish involvement in immigration and it’s a good example of this. Kmac spends around two thirds of the chapter talking about Jewish opposition to the 1924 restriction act(obviously true) and then he claims that Jews were responsible for the 1965 act. Here is the only paragraph I could find in a 60 page chapter that directly discusses the passage of the 1965 act.“Handlin wrote that the McCarran-Walter law was only a temporary setback, and he was right. Thirty years after the triumph of restrictionism, only Jewish groups remained as persistent and tenacious advocates of a multicultural America. Forty-one years after the 1924 triumph of restrictionism and the national origins provision and only 13 years after its reaffirmation with the McCarran-Walter Act of 1952, Jewish organizations successfully supported ending the geographically based national origins basis of immigration intended to result in an ethnic status quo in what was now a radically altered intellectual and political climate.”What a curious choice of language. He doesn’t say “Jewish groups were the only ones in favor of increased immigration”, he says they were “advocates of a multicultural America”.  He doesn’t say they “ended” the national origins quotas, but that they “successfully supported ending” them.  It’s almost like Jewish activism had very little to do with substantive changes in American immigration policy, and MacDonald knows this but is trying to mislead the reader without explicitly lying. (In fact, the USA started easing up racial quotas in the 1940s and this continued for over two decades before the 65 act). I say that any claim MacDonald makes should be taken with a grain of salt – you can never be sure if he’s being forthright or not.

            And this, my friends, is why you don’t debate with Jews. Thank you for proving my point.
Let’s all just agree that we need to separate. Jews can have their society, and we’ll have ours. No hard feelings and best of luck to you.

                    100% concur. When Shmuel, Moche, Binyamin, Rachel, Sarah, and Ruth came over on the Mayflower, blazed a centuries long trail through the wilderness, and tamed the vast wilds of the continent they surely only wanted other Hebes here. Oh wait… that was Europeans, my bad.We made the same mistake that Russia made in centuries prior. Kindness and naivete and it got us subsumed and degraded over the same long timeline. I’ll give you all credit, you play the long game VERY well so take a bow for getting one over on Europeans -again- but don’t act like you were in any way part of the people who lay ‘claim’ to the United States as it was. You are an interloper, period.

                    What a mouth on this kid. Your overbearing mother would disapprove.Unlike Jews, I have no homeland, so I’ll stick around and try to build a community for my people within the larger society, just as Jews do.Regardless, your antagonism is telling. Many whites just want to separate ourselves from Jews and Jewish influence. Nothing more. We wish you no harm and are more than happy for you to have your own communities.Indeed, this is what we’re witnessing around the world. China, Russia, India, Saudi Arabia, etc., they are all trying to break away from Jewish financial control and a foreign culture/morality imposed by Jews.We don’t hate you. We just don’t want you in our lives, businesses or culture. You have your society, and we’ll have ours. It’s fascinating that this idea upsets Jews.

                        You’re the one with the big mouth. I posted an honest assessment of Kevin MacDonald’s body of work based on what I’ve read of him. This evidently went over your head as you failed to address a single point I made, and indeed told me the entire site that debating with me is a waste of time, only to top it all off by implying that I and my family and my loved ones should be forcibly expelled from America.  And because you say “no hard feelings”, I’m supposed to smile back?  You’re a coward. You don’t even have the courage to flame someone over the internet without erecting a veneer of plausibile deniability.  If you want me to leave my home, you’ll have to do it the hard way. Meanwhile, prove me wrong about MacDonald – if you can.

                        Why does some whites (or other groups) not wanting to include Jews in their own communities make you so angry?Whites and other groups don’t care if you include us in your community. What about being on your own so disturbs Jews?Regardless, I never said anything about Jews having to leave. You’re (not surprisingly) lying. Separate communities is all that I suggested.As to your critique (see what I did there) of MacDonald, I don’t care. Just as I don’t care about what really happened in the Holocaust.   Just as I don’t care about long-ago events in China or India or Africa.I and many other whites simply want to exclude you from our lives. No violence. You live in your community with your people and culture, and we’ll live in ours. Separation, nothing more.

                Finkels do have their own society–and country–Israel. Oddly enough, a very significant percentage of them prefer to dwell among their erstwhile gentile oppressors. Odd that. And it tracks with nuggras who, for all their kvetching about whitey’s racism, have never shown much inclination to move to Africa or even to carve their own seperate nation out of AINO’s hide. I’m left to conclude that, as much as the Finkels and nuggras hate us, they simply can’t live as well as they feel they’re entitled to, without us. The term parasite springs unbidden to mind.

                    Nil has already made the point that he is a jew first. Not an American. He gives comments like who doesn’t and obviously true when jews favor things like mass immigration against their “fellow” countrymen which he admits aren’t. Jews are a stereotype because they favor Middle men professions and nepotism which favors their coethnics. Don’t give a shit about America except exploiting for short term gain before moving on. Maybe it’s just their leaders like sorts but jews never criticize other jews no matter how poor they act. Yes jews act in their own interest against their countrymen but it’s OK because they are super duper smart.

            It has been too long since I read COC, but MacDonald does some Motte-and-Bailey in his most recent book. This is a common rhetorical trick for some reason. Cofnas is a sophist, so his writing is littered with a variety of logical fallacies. In the case of MacDonald, I think the issue is the subject he is covering is too broad. That was what I said in my review of his latest book.

                    Citizen: “He has no desire to actually debate and find the truth.”The j00z are the children of the father of lies; the j00z have no interest in Truth.The j00ish race is an utterly meta-darwinistic phenomenon.The j00ish race cares not a whit about Truth, nor about lies for that matter.The j00ish race cares only about WINNING.If the j00z can win by speaking truthfully, then the j00z will speak truthfully.Whereas if the j00z can win by lying, then the j00z will lie.[Although my guess is that there are a significant number of sadistic j00z who experience something akin a licentious/lascivious perversion when successfully pulling off a grand fraudulence of Chutzpah.]But concepts such as “Truths” and “Lies” are meaningless to the j00.The j00 is interested solely in expediency.To the j00, a concept is truthful if and only if the concept propels the j00 to VICTORY.Whereas a concept is false if and only if the concept lures the j00 into DEFEAT.Until you start analyzing the j00 as a thoroughly meta-darwinian phenomenon, you won’t be able to understand the j00.[BTW, precisely the same is true of kneegr0ws, and likely myriad other races with whom we are not familiar. Allegiance to Truth and Truth alone is a purely White European Christian trait.]===============John 8:44 – “Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do: he was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the TRUTH, because there is no TRUTH in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.”John 14:16 – “And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of TRUTH; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.”John 16:7 – “Nevertheless I tell you the TRUTH; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:of sin, because they believe not on me; of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged. I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. 	Howbeit when he, the Spirit of TRUTH, is come, he will guide you into all TRUTH: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you.”

                Well, I’d dispute that the defects in KMac’s arguments are solely or primarily due to his having bitten off more than he can chew. I’ve read many of the books he cites and there’s a huge difference between what they state and what MacDonald reports.  Here’s one example, from Separation and its Discontents:“In recent times Jewish strategy has often included attempts to mold personal beliefs via the mass media. The Dreyfus Affair in fin de siècle France “saw the emergence, for the first time, of a distinct class of intellectuals . . . as a major power in European society and among whom emancipated Jews were an important, sometimes a dominant, element. A new issue was raised, not just for France: Who controls our culture?” (Johnson 1988, 387). “The young Jewish intellectuals, and their growing band of radical allies, began by asking for Justice and ended by seeking total victory and revenge. In doing so, they gave their enemies an awesome demonstration of Jewish and philosemitic intellectual power” (Johnson 1988, 388). While at the beginning of the affair the media was controlled by the anti-Semites, by the end of it, fully 90 percent of the literature on the subject was pro-Dreyfus. This campaign involved newspapers, photogra-phy, and cinema and gradually it tilted public opinion in favor of Dreyfus.[12]”MacDonald is obviously trying to lead the reader on – you’re intended to think that the Dreyfus affair was some instance where ethnocentric Jews brainwashed the masses into getting their way.  Yet how conveniently does he omit the fact that Dreyfus was innocent!  No shit, people are not going to approve of imprisoning a man for a crime he didn’t commit. No brainwashing necessary.Does this single quote prove that MacDonald is a fraud?  of course not, but as I dug into his citations I noticed that these errors formed a pattern – always in favor of Europeans, always against Jews. Mind you, I have no issue with KMac’s anti semitism as such.  It doesn’t endear him to me, but he’s free to assert that Jews are waging a generations long war of extermination against the whiterace. He just needs to show his work rather than bullshitting about it.

                    If the conclusion was truly that Jews are mindfully attempting to exterminate Europeans, then yes that makes no sense.  If tomorrow all the Europeans went up into heaven and you guys were left behind for being mean to God’s son, well, now you’ve got 14 million Jews versus 2 billion Muslims.The actual argument is that Jews compulsively attempt to weaken and undermine the dominant culture wherever their diaspora settles. The reason is that historically once the Jews had positioned themselves so that everyone owes them money and they’re bleeding the peasants and nobility alike, then suddenly the king finds Jesus and orders a pogrom, moneylenders out of the temple and such.  This didn’t happen in the more cosmopolitan places where you had lots of ethnic groups competing.The more interesting question is to what degree is this behavior conscious?  I highly doubt that Jews spend their time tenting their fingers thinking about how they can defeat Christianity, more likely that repeat instances of selection pressure have evolved Jews to intrinsically favor living in places with weak nationalism.  Which Jew produced more offspring: the one who migrated to the New York in 1900 or the one that kept living in Linz next door to that mediocre painter?

                        First off, thank you for the intellectually honest reply. Second, I try not to say things I can’t back up.  From the preface to Culture of Critique:“The best strategy for a collectivist group like the Jews for destroying Europeans therefore is to convince the Europeans of their own moral bankruptcy. A major theme of CofC is that this is exactly what Jewish intellectual movements have done. They have presented Judaism as morally superior to European civilization and European civilization as morally bankrupt and the proper target of altruistic punishment. The consequence is that once Europeans are convinced of their own moral depravity, they will destroy their own people in a fit of altruistic punishment. The general dismantling of the culture of the West and eventually its demise as anything resembling an ethnic entity will occur as a result of a moral onslaught triggering a paroxysm of altruistic punishment.”This is KMac’s strategy – he keeps his tone very reasonable and scholarly in the hopes that readers will take him on good faith and not notice the absolute whoppers he likes to cram into his essays. So yeah, an intentional decentralized Jewish plot to genocide whites is exactly what KMac has asserted behind his Motte-Bailey tricks.Anyhow, it’s obviously untrue that the leaders of the west are importing muds as an act of altruistic punishment – they’re acting in what they believe to be their short term self interest and they’re too damn stupid to think of the long term.  They don’t see the whites they rule over as their own people anymore which is one of the many places where the pathological altruism theory breaks down.Regarding the rest of your post, I think you’re projecting post emancipation conditions too far backwards.  Jews are always trying to attack the host society?  I beg to differ.  We usually had rather limited legal rights compared to gentile aristocrats, and any privileges granted to us could be easily revoked by a whim of the king. Contrary to the accusations of medieval anti semites we were mostly trying to keep our heads down and go about our business, because that’s all you can afford to do when your life and livelihood rest upon a razor’s edge. Why do you think so many towns and countries were able to expel us in the first place?  Power, real power, is physical force.  The peasantry had numbers, the nobility had arms and training, we had neither.  We mostly had to play the middleman between various factions and suck up to the ruling the class. An undignified existence, sure, but it’s a living.

                    It’s not extermination. It’s parasitism. Exploiting the work of the host population and extracting their work in multiple ways including the theft of Edison’s invention and fleeing to California at the turn of the 20th century. The only things jews know is to exploit. Be middle men without any loyalty to the “nation” other than the ability to extract money and labor. Which is why the leaders pursue objectives at odds with fellow coutrymen that aren’t their countrymen. That was the biggest shock to me was the realization that melting pot idea was believed by nobody outside of European Christians. The sooner the put that idea and other bullshit to rest and focus like jews, blacks and asians do, the better off they’ll be against the exploitation and the promotion of degeneracy and robbery, especially from the two cities on the coasts.

Everyone everywhere knows exactly what they think about everything already.What is gained from him coming here and garbaging up this little corner of the internet with more of the universal narrative?Because dissidents talking together about issues that matter scares them, it lead to trouble the last 109 times the locals started noticing.The point isnt to convince anyone, obviously everyone here knows better.  To the extent truth is a mental category in his mind, he knows the truth too.  The only point is to cripple productive talk between noticers with bothersome talmudry.  Maybe push off 110 a little longer.

            That’s a bit disingenuous. The “easing up of racial quotas” between the end of WWII and Hart-Celler didn’t address the populations limited by the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and Johnson-Reed (1924). Hart-Celler did. Now we *could* discuss why strict quotas were put on East European immigration, but I think most people understood why anarchist bombings, organized crime, etc., were undesirable.

                I think that would reinforce my point – if the USA opened the gates to Asians before readmitting EE Jews(which they did, in the fifties), then that implies that Jewish interests were not the primary driver behind immigration reform. In fact, it seems that the loosening of racial restrictions begun because the Anglo-American elite wanted to use immigration to America as a sort of diplomatic weapon in the cold war -get people in, have them Americanized and let them spread this to their home countries so they wouldn’t go communist.  Of course, the immigrants themselves had other ideas.

                    The problem you have here is that you are telling people that they should believe you rather than their lying eyes and that leads people to think MacDonald is on to something. Jews are now and always have been disproportionately in favor of open immigration, not just here but everywhere, except Israel. The question is why?A “good” answer is that minorities will always favor openness in all things. Otherwise, the majority will craft rules to exclude minorities. The principle of openness serves the interests of minority groups. Open borders is just one example. Logic dictates that you focus on that aspect of the immigration question.Denying what everyone thinks is obvious is a bad strategy.

                        Well, this is another example of motte-bailey(not that I’m accusing you of disingenousness). I mean, I fully agree that Jews tend to be irrationally pro immigration but I don’t think this really makes them different from other Ellis Islanders like Italians or Irish, who came at a time when America’s ethnic character was already too diluted to completely assimilate large numbers of immigrants.I’m really more against the KMac formulation where we tricked an innocent country into suiciding itself for shits and giggles. That isn’t remotely true. This is a common response when I discuss the scholarship in the CofC trilogy – people treat it like I’m trying to police any sort of discussion on Jews or immigration when I’m mostly critiquing the micro-level assertions of one specific guy. Even I tend to lose my train of thought. Motte and bailey.(Incidentally, I would dispute that “Jews favor immigration everywhere expect Israel”. That dual morality thing only exists for a small number of neocons.  Liberal Jews in the US might like Israel but they also think the country should be nicer to Palestinians and more accommodating of African refugees)

        The most obvious, and most low hanging fruit is the genetic basis for IQ.  It was commonly accepted until WW2, which is why so many Malthusian groups existed over a hundred years ago.  You can see it with every animal and the human animal is no exception.  I have a friend with a border collie that knows how to turn the door knobs to get into off-limits rooms in the house.  I have another friend with a mostly Chow dog that would consider something like that to be nuclear physics.This brings us back to humans.  If we admit that a human IQ pyramid exists, and a certain group sits on top, as The Bell Curve suggests, who is sitting on the bottom?  What group of people would fail the “human” door-knob test.  It would possibly be seen in credit reporting, or unexpectedly lashing out in violence at a Target….etc…..  It would be a group that’s pretty incapable of handling the modern world without all kinds of interlocking subsidies and free navigation from legions of social services….Then we would wonder who else is near the bottom of the period.   Perhaps a group of people who are far overrepresented as gardeners and custodians.  Etc.This would lead us all to the immigration question.  All of our leaders would consider the question of human migration patterns, and who is allowed to settle where to be of vital importance for the well being of society.  It’s a slippery slope that leads directly to strict immigration controls and possibly family planning incentives for certain groups.

            We used to use proxies for IQ in admission to the US for residency.  We had—as do many other countries currently—quotas for those with skills useful/needed to a technological society.  That would still be enough to solve the IQ diminishment problem of minorities if it were now in practice.  This is how my father came over after WWII at a time of closure to immigration.  He hit the ground running when he got,off the the boat (literally).

        Anyone who has spent a lot of time around our small-hatted friends (such as I have) will know just how important being small hats is to people who are small hats. They talk about it incessantly.  It is one of the first things they will tell you about themselves when meeting them for the first time (in a friend setting, like being introduced to your friend’s friend), even if they aren’t religious in the slightest.  Being a minority is probably part of it, but just going by my own experiences, I’d say there is definitely some group stuff going on.

            I’ve noticed this, too. Particularly in intellectual settings. They want you to know they’re part of the smart set. Nothing wrong with that, really. In fact, it’s slightly amusing in a sympathetic way. But it does make quite clear that Finkels are extremely proud of their ethnicity. And they expect you to be impressed.

        I don’t want to be “that guy”, but as Z would say, I can’t help but to chase after the stick. I hope I can be taken seriously in this comment, and not merely cause many sets of eyes to roll…The “high Jewish IQ” claim is a cultural meme that has no basis in reality. The video below thoroughly debunks the meme, I highly suggest every one watches is it who believes in this claim. It is very erudite and professional.In short, the meme originates from a few misapplied sources. Basically the original claim comes from an old study of IQ between groups, but for whatever reason, people began to reference an isolated high Jewish score in the verbal intelligence section without accounting for their total score. Once all the sections are factored in the total results, the total Jewish IQ score is the same give or take as whites. There are a few other sources each as false or misleading as the first.Mainly, once a meme gets culturally embedded it becomes very hard to extricate, especially if there is seemingly enough floating variables to support it.https://youtu.be/stLCurXu0fc

            The high IQ is real, but not to the extent that is widely believed.  The 115 number is based on a study whose own author says it’s not a representative sample.  The 105 or 106, I’m willing to believe though.  After all, it’s not like small hats invading fields cause it to collapse.
But even if it was true and the number was 115 and they are not over-represented even after  adjusting for IQ, that doesn’t mean we have no legitimate interest in keeping them out or in much lower numbers in certain fields.

                I could create a study which boosts Western European scores up to 125 as long as its not “representative.” In one of the studies most often referenced for “high Jewish IQ”, the tests was given to small subset of Jewish children attending high-priced private schools in New York… Children’s IQ is graded on a very inaccurate curve, and of course the sample of high end private schools will skew things further.If you haven’t watched the video, I highly suggest it. I’m not saying they are dumb. I’m not saying they can’t handle anything Whites can’t handle in terms of societal complexity; I do agree they do tend to have higher verbal IQ etc.

                    Doesn’t explain the over representation among Nobel laureates does it?  Jewish ethnocentrism among the nomination and selection committees?You are running contrary to just about every mainstream HBD scientist I’ve read.  YT videos are no substitute for scientific journal articles and reputation in the field.Now I agree that an SD above the mean is a ridiculous over estimation, but an average IQ for the *past* population around 105-108, coupled with a culture that prized higher education to achieve group status would do it.  Such would produce enough outlier geniuses as shown by the list of Noble laureates.Now as to direction of *current* population IQ, Peter Frost cites some studies and provides musings on a precipitous population IQ decline for Ashkenazi Jews:https://peterfrost.substack.com/p/ashkenazi-jews-and-recent-cognitiveSeems the Jewish immigrants have picked up the “American Disease” and the resulting decline in their average IQ.  I suspect in a generation, they’ll be no discernible space between our positions on Jewish IQ.

                        Genetic studies are estimating Ashkenazi IQ around 108, but the consensus is that it will settle in around 110-112, but that does not account for the current decline in Jewish IQ. As someone said, 1974 was peak Jewish guy in America. In 2074, when people think of Jews, they will think of those weird guys with the fur cylinders on their heads that live separate from everyone else.

                        I could see 108 IQ with verbal being even higher.I also agree that Ashkenazis are a disappearing breed. The birthrate is low and out marriage is very high. Granted, when Jews marry goys, they marry pretty smart goys, so their kids are pretty smart.That said, the kids lose a lot of personality traits that I wrote about somewhere else, and those personality traits are just as important to Jewish over-success as IQ. Smart half-Jews act a lot like smart gentiles, i.e., they do well at school but they’re not on the make. They just want a good job and to have some fun.

            I’d be surprised if Jews didn’t have a slightly higher IQ than whites and even Asians at least for verbal. However, I’ve maintained for a very long time that the big genetic advantage of Jews isn’t raw IQ; it’s personality traits.The obvious trait of ethnocentrism is well known and, certainly, accounts for a large part of their success, but I’d argue that there are several others just as important.To start, Jews are dramatically more likely to push for business success than whites. Many white guys start a business, but once it reaches a certain size, they’re happy and stop. Jews don’t think that like that. Jews will push to make that business as large as possible, even if it means not seeing their family much.Knowing that there’s more money to be made just kills them. They can’t let it go.Second, Jews have an amazing amount of self-confidence when it comes to business or professional life. They far, far more likely than whites roll the dice on a business venture or to take on larger roles in a business. Jews are cocky as hell.Often times, those gamble fail, but sometimes, they don’t. And when they succeed, the Jew becomes very rich. The Jew then takes that money and starts to 1) look to make more money and 2) give a portion of that money to Jewish groups to promote Jewish interests.So, sure, Jews might be a bit smarter on average than whites, but it’s those personality traits that seem to account for most of their success.Again, it’s genetics, but it’s not the genetics that people think about.

I can’t speak for Koreans or Japanese – maybe they’re as avaricious, I dunno – but the Chinese hold doing business and having a financial safety net, and “face” as a result of financial success – in the highest regard.They also lie and cheat whenever possible. Then when caught, they lash out or grovel in a most unappealing way. Ask anyone who’s ever done business in China. The older ones who came of age in the 1990s are most likely to worship the yuan, because when the CCP outlawed Chinese spiritualism, and then the CCP turned into a mercantilist gang after Mao, what filled the void was raw materialism.That being said, many of them see the rapaciousness and are trying to end it. There is an enormous and growing Christian community among the Chinese. The non-Christian leadership seems to be putting nationalism and dignity above materialism. Funny that you see the same thing in Israel…Tel Aviv besides, there is a growing number of traditionalists in the Jewish heartland.In summary: money corrupts, but absolute money-loving people corrupts absolutely.

                Also, as both foreigners and infidels, Jews have no moral obligations towards their host nations.
Whites mostly study law to help build a just society because we think of society as “ours”, Jews mostly study law so they can screw government and neighbors out of money because it’s not their country.
In their own country they have race laws such as I fervently pray my government would copy, and a 100′ border wall with barbed wire on top and a sign saying “Refugees Fuck Off Or We Open Fire!”

                    Yeah, I forgot to mention that. Jews have an advantage over their host populations that’s similar to the advantage that sociopaths have over everyone else: they don’t feel emotion toward that other person.In college, I tangentially knew this one guy who scored with women at will. What was odd was that he wasn’t particularly good-looking nor particularly a fast talker. But what he had was a (terrifying) ability to not care about the women that he was talking to.He’d just tell them what they wanted to hear, no fear or remorse. Insane but effective.Jews are similar. It’s not their country or their people, so they can be much more clinical in their behavior. It’s a big advantage.

                The highest IQ religious sect are the presbyterians.  We dont see them overrepresented in any corporate industry, probably because Jesus said “its easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.”  Whereas the talmud encourages manipulation for financial gain.  Even the inventor of the fleshlite is jewish.  No shame, these people. It could be genetic or religious, because both influence each other over time.

            Even nepotism requires some minimum intelligence. Look at those with rock bottom intelligence — the blacks. They don’t even have enough brains to realise that a system of reciprocal favorsibased on trust and goodwill is win-win.
The Patels start with one run-down motel. The whole family pitches in and those working are not paid even minimum wage. This allows for the family to save and buy a second motel, then a third. And it’s a sector of the economy — run-down and cheap motels — that the corporates are not interested in. Likewise for convenience stores in run-down areas.

                Of course, which is why you don’t let outsiders into your society.
I don’t give two farts if the Patels are hard workers or smart. They’re not my people. Let them open hotels in India.
Israel wouldn’t let in a million 140 IQ, industrious Chinese even if it meant improving their economy and raising the living standard of Jews. You know why? Because those smart Chinese aren’t Jews!

As hired hands. Not the same thing. There are Indian business houses that have access to global finance capital — Tata, Birla, Reliance, Adani, and maybe a dozen other major Indian houses. But these are the exceptions. However, the situation will be different twenty or thirty years down the road.

        The heritability of behavioral traits is extremely well established in biology via countless laboratory and field studies that are highly repeatable. And it is demonstrated in a wide array of species spanning from bacteria to Homo sapiens. Denying this documented reality is the equivalent of denying gravity.For example, some behaviors are automatic (think breathing or eye blinking). Others are more discretionary (think flight or fight response to perceived danger). What muddies the water is that some behaviors are soft drivers (think proclivity) versus hard imperatives. Ethnocentrism (which is really just tribalism at the root) is a soft motivator that largely operates at the subliminal level of cognition. Various cohorts of Homo sapiens will evolve and express these soft (but generic) group behaviors which typically are adaptations to environmental conditions. For example, Scandinavians tend to be communitarian-oriented because that was a necessary social trait to sustain group survival through long winters of deprivation.No one gets to choose their parents, so blaming a Jew for being Jewish is asinine. But if a specific Jew is doing something harmful to others, then that must be redressed regardless of religion or affiliation. And this principle applies across the board and is a necessary component of group survival strategy.

            “No one gets to choose their parents, so blaming a Jew for being Jewish is asinine. But if a specific Jew is doing something harmful to others, then that must be redressed regardless of religion or affiliation.”I disagree. In a multi-racial society, group behavior counts. You are both an individual and a member of a tribe. You will be judged both on your own behavior and the behavior of your tribe. If a particular tribe is causing trouble, every member of that tribe should be held accountable.Your reasoning only works in a homogenous society. That’s gone. Time to start playing by the rules of a multi-racial society.

                Ancient texts are rife with tribes killing a random member of another tribe as retribution for some injustice.
Jews are notorious for locking shields with their own, no matter how odious the person.  See Leo Frank for instance.

                    There’s a larger reason for holding every member of a tribe responsible for the larger actions of tribe members: it forces members of that tribe to police their own people.
Jews are quite obviously not very good at policing their own. That or they approve of those actions. Either way, we know what Jews do to every society that allows them in and that all that we need to know.

                        Prior to the conclusion of the so-called “Civil Rights Movement,” white people held the black race accountable for individual instances of black pathology. Now that rarely meant execution of a random negro in recompense for another negro murdering a white person. What it did mean was that blacks, en bloc, were segregated and suppressed. In theory, if blacks desired a better lot for their people, they would have to behave in an increasingly civilized manner.Now this social system did not turn Harlem into 18th-century Vienna, but it did result in negroes behaving in semi-civilized fashion around whites, and it allowed them to produce some respectable cultural artefacts, particularly in the realm of jazz. After white America took its boot off the black neck in the second half of the 60s, all hell broke loose, and we’re now beset by African savagery, both physical and cultural.

I for one would rather not have to look at Leo. And while one can debate what percentage of the folks in question have ‘higher IQ’, my feeling based on extensive experience is that 98% are hard on the eyes,  and 100% have traits that rhyme with ‘gooey’.

                There are many ways to deal with a diverse society in which each grouping possesses both favorable and harmful behaviors. Voluntary segregation is the most common (and natural) solution, and it is found all over the planet. Where things problematic is when “governments” subvert this natural process in service to some “stated” altruistic goal, thereby imposing involuntary proximity and attendant strife. At the root therefore, the source of this problem is government and not the unique traits of any particular population cohort. Stated another way, you cannot force Jewishness out of Jews by either government fiat or societal coercion. Its in the genes and not going to change anytime soon. If you want a peaceful and diverse community, you have to allow people to segregate as they so desire.

                    True. But groups by their nature will seek to dominate other groups. And the group that controls the government will attempt to use government force to gain even more power.
This is why multiracial societies are always dominated by one of the tribes. Our society is run by Jews for the benefit of Jews.
The dominate tribe will never allow the other tribes to peacefully separate.

                        I agree with your thinking. It is unlikely for the government of a multiracial society to be “neural”. Michael Anton is as clueless and delusional as 1960s communists in this respect.I recommended The Ethnic Phenomenon by Pierre L. van den Berghe.It discusses for example the idea of consociational democracy aka giving each group proportional or some representation in the government and has the effect of reducing focus on class and more on ethnic spoils.This explains why class politics has died since 1960s as US govt began distributing ethnic spoils

        Cofnas had better be careful. Anyone who talks about those who operate in the shadows and run everything, is liable to cut off his nose despite his face. The Name Changers do not like any attention at all, unless it involves their public relation outfits like the SPLC decrying any research into their activities as antisemitism.Try taking a look into what banks really own the Federal Reserve Bank. They are foreign, everyone of them has names that would be considered normal names if you are an Israeli citizen or business, and it is nearly impossible to do a search on the subject. They have done a very good job of scrubbing out the names of our real owners on the internet.One thing they can’t scratch out are the facts about FJ Biden’s first cabinet. Of the 15 members, 10 were indeed Hebrews. Considering they are about 1.6% of our population, it can safely be said they hold the keys of power in the Executive Branch.Sometimes their public relations scam is not conducted that well. For example, Ukraine is full of Nazis, and if you point that out on Facebook with pictures to prove it, they will put you in Facebook Jail for a month. Guaranteed.Israel has aided the Ukie Nazis, and that creates the public relations problem. Aren’t Nazis and Jews supposed to be mortal enemies? On the other hand, something like 70% of the Ukrainian Government is Hebrew, and that makes the contradictions even more muddled.Maybe the narrative we’re told isn’t quite right. The question is, how long have we been fed a line?

        I would think it can generally be agreed upon that Jews have substantial over representation with respect to the levers of power and influence in AINO.  I would also think it can generally agreed upon that over representation has further produced many negative cultural and societal outcomes.  Of course not all blame for these ills can be placed at the feet of the small hats, as substantial numbers of goyim have been complicit as well.  However, can they be highlighted as the root cause in many cases?  Probably.

        To be honest, I’m pretty Jewed out. Everyone knows what Jews do to every society in which they are allowed to enter and to have any degree of free rein. We have 109 recorded examples. Yes, there are plenty of individual Jews who are fine, but the Jewish community will do what it has always done, so those individuals Jews don’t matter.The exact reasons for what they do can be debated, but the outcome of letting Jews into your society cannot. So, frankly, I don’t care about “why” they do what they do because I already know the “what” they’re going to do.I don’t know the evolutionary process that created ticks, but I know that I don’t want one attached to my body. I also know that I can’t argue with a tick and make act like another animal.Debating with Jews is a fool’s game. There’s one way to deal with Jews: Exclude them from your community. The second that you start to debate with a Jew, you’ve lost, so don’t fall into that trap.

        When Cofnas uses the phrase “anti-Jewish narrative,” that indicates his strong self-serving bias and reveals he can’t be trusted to seek truth dispassionately. “Enthnocentrism” is a fine word, yet I prefer the term ETHNIC NEPOTISM. It’s impossible for me to believe that there isn’t a ton of ethnic nepotism going on with the Tribe. Sure, a lot of their people are smart, but that can’t explain the full extent of their often shocking overrepresentation in certain fields. Are you trying to tell me there’s no ethnic nepotism in Hollywood? Get out of here. That’s just silly.

            Cofnas, like most Jews, doesn’t debate in good faith when the subject has any possible way of connecting to the Jewish people.
He’ll say whatever he needs to say to protect his people. You’re never really “debating” with a Jew. For them, it’s always a fight to the death, so finding the truth doesn’t matter. Winning the debate matters.
Whites can’t seem to figure this out.

                Ironic – his display of inability to debate this issue honestly confirms the ethnocentrism of his tribe, the exact thing he set out to refute.
“Not that there’s anything wrong with that” to quote one of his better known tribesman.  Whites could use some ethnocentrism of their own.  For some reason Whites seem particularly vulnerable to the Hollow Cost card when trying to counter the tribe’s shenanigans which adversely impact White’s interests.

I’ve been estranged from mainstream politics so long—and bludgeoned with the maudlin Schindler’s List, whiny violin stuff since grade school—and confess to having had nothing but dark thoughts. “If the Sacklers’ forebears had been liquidated, think of how many people wouldn’t have overdosed on pain pills after that bunk ‘less than one percent become addicted’ study. If Larry Fink’s people had gotten it in World War II, we wouldn’t have to worry about him trying to gobble up every house in North America for his ‘land of renters’ dream. I started thinking about all the old Asian ladies beaten or robbed and young girls pushed onto train tracks by sociopaths and thought, ‘If Soros hadn’t gotten out, then he wouldn’t have funded these crazy bail initiatives, and all those people might still be alive.’I’m pretty sure those aren’t the kinds of conclusions I was supposed to draw from that Holocaust exhibit. That said, Jews aren’t totally immune to the deracinating effects of living in America. They don’t seem to get fat—usually—but their rates of exogamy are off the charts, and most care more about seeing Trump drawn and quartered than doing anything for Israel. You saw this when Trump was president, and he squandered his political capital doing things for Jews (and blacks) who were never going to vote for him.MacDonald may be wrong in evolutionary terms, but he’s right about the Frankfurt School for Social Research, and Theodore Adorno’s fatal conflation of authority with authoritarianism. Every time you hear someone blathering about patriarchy, it’s because ole Adolf swung and missed that time at bat. Actually, if we’d just refused these guys entry to America—especially Marcuse—that might’ve been enough to keep them for laying their eggs in the eyes of our children in the nests they call colleges. Eggs, incidentally, which are still hatching.

        Another issue is cultural practices also have an evolutionary path, as practices that worked in one time become suicidal in another, and the ability to select different social norms becomes as crucial to survival as one’s genes. The Jews have obviously developed very powerful cultural practices that have allowed them to punch way above their weight while being very outnumbered. Those same cultural practices are also why they were continuously kicked out of countries.Culture is still downstream from genetics, but let’s not understate there is still a lot of room to maneuver to instill genetic survival mechanisms through social engineering.

            I think we should look at culture as a model of reality. There is a lot of overlap in these models, but there are important differences. These models aid in our fitness, so they are subject to the fitness test. Jewish cultural models in the east evolved under different conditions than in the West, the result is clear differences between the two. Paul Gottfried has talked about this when you were allowed to discuss it.

                So, it’s possible that East European Jews are genetically slightly different from West European Jews.
Happens all the time. In Germany, there a many genetic difference both in appearance and personality among the Germans living in various locations.

        “That is the real problem with MacDonald’s theory. Evolutionary biology is gene-centered, so something like group selection gets little support.”
What am I missing? How are these two stances at odds with each other? I am going to be more partial towards someone who has more genes in common with me. Genetic proximity matters, and it is a synonym for group survival strategy. I want genes like mine to survive.

                Not sure that I understand what you’re saying.
Sure, evolution is at the gene level, but those genes will eventually spread throughout the group and survive or those genes won’t and will die out.
What’s the difference?

                    There is no difference.  Indeed, ethno-centrism is studied/talked about widely as potentially at the gene level.  Behavioral tendencies are at least partially associated genetically.  There are for example genes identified as being more common in Blacks associated with violent proclivities.  When that gene is in Whites, we see similar behavior.
Not sure this is ground not already covered.

                Try to explain the beagle phenotype.  They chase rabbits exclusively. Kill a rabbit, they don’t try to eat it, but rather lose interest and wonder off .  Occasionally, a beagle will start chasing deer.  My Dad would unceremoniously shoot these dogs.  Of course we also bred good dog with good dog.  In fact, brother with sister/cousin (like the Rothchilds).  Several generations in, we produced some neurotic specimens.  Still remember one, Crazy Daisy.  Took a high school buddy hunting with us once.  Dad got pissed on that particular hunt and killed a dog.  Kid shit himself.  Still lol remembering it.

            If the 21st century will be defined by “the battle between collectivists of all stripes and individualists,” then I’ll tell you right now that the individualists will lose.
Doesn’t the history of failure of conservatism demonstrate this truth?

                    The needle that people who feel a strong affinity for individualism, like me, must thread is that we must act tribally with other groups while allowing personal liberty to members within the tribe.
For me, the goal is fascism facing outward and the American frontier within.  When there is conflict between what’s good for the group and personal liberty, personal liberty is second.

                        Exactly.
Ironically, the only way to treat people as individuals is to think of the tribe first. Once you create a community – almost assuredly based on ancestry – and protect that community from outsiders, you can treat the members of that community as individuals.

        Minor point. From du Lion’s post:
“In 1927 Alekhine defeated Capablanca to become the first Soviet world champion.”
Alekhine was never Soviet. He was a White Russian who lived in exile in Western Europe. Later the Soviets appropriated Alekhine for their own propadandistic purposes. Also, in passing, Alekhine was not Jewish (nor does du Lion say he was). In the 1930s, at the behest of the Nazis, he wrote a number of journalistic pieces contrasting Jewish chess with Aryan chess.

        Z-man’s really risking drawing in a bunch of pro-Mustache Man LARPers today. I commend him for taking that risk.“Ethnocentrism” is a perfectly fine word, yet I prefer the term ETHNIC NEPOTISM. Though I have no proof of its occurrence, I find it hard to believe that there isn’t a lot of ethnic nepotism going on in an industry such as Hollywood. I also consider it ludicrous to deny that 1. members of the Tribe often have interests specific to the Tribe and 2. those particular interests are often in conflict with the interests of the majority population. That said, anyone who thinks that the Tribe is solely responsible for every evil under the sun is grossly oversimplifying matters. The White goyim have engaged in too much self-destructive idiocy to blame their problems even on an out-group that admittedly enjoys a disproportionate amount of power and influence.
