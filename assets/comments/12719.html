        Awhile back I remember reading an article about how it was a really dark harbinger of things to come that multiple politicians (including I believe Obama) admitted that they were big fans of the Netflix series “House of Cards.” The thinking was, Yes, we know politicians in D.C. are corrupt and soulless and sociopathic, but as long as they sort of try to conceal it and maintain some kind of theatrical conceit of humanity in public, some semblance of decorum or sanity is not lost. Well, I don’t think heads will roll/anyone will go to jail for the Worse-than-Watergate scandal involving Hillary, Obama, the FBI, and Fusion GPS. This doing away with the conceit of democracy or the rule-of-law will probably not lead to a revolt by the people or a decay in public trust (it can’t decay any further). It will just serve as proof of the invulnerability/Teflon status of the Deep State. I think they’re deliberately being sloppy and open in their corruption in order to demoralize us and rub it in our faces.

            +100.They are strutting, they know we can’t beat them. I’m more likely to be killed by an asteroid than any of these f*ckers will go to prison or even lose their pensions.One hope though, albeit romantic… it has been said that well-fed, comfortable people never revolt. Locked in this polyglot empire of some 330 million there must be 100 million of us who still live according to principles consistent with national wealth, morality and integrity, “normal people”, as Zman calls them. Well, the American Revolution was fought by such people. The instigators of this movement were not hoi polloi suffering under the whip of some crazed foreign dictator. They were people like us, who saw things like the tea tax and the Stamp Act as violations of their natural right to autonomy.The Clinton presidency was to my mind the alarum; oh sure, the media had been anti-conservative, anti-GOP, since at least 1964; but they were still independent enough to acknowledge the obvious, which is why Carter failed to win re-election, why Gary Hart was tossed aside after a sex scandal, why the McGovern ticket was doomed after revelations concerning the sanity of his choice for running mate, why powerful congressmen like Dan Rostonkowski had to go in light of known details of his corruption.With the emergence of Clinton, the media went from sympathetic yet professional, to committed and fawning tools of one of the two major parties. Clintonism rules us now; everything foul in the branches of the government all seem to have a Clinton connection.In 1956, in the USSR, the vast personal system of control that Stalin built over decades had to be “exposed” by Khrushchev, the Trump of his time and place. The rise of Brezhnev in 1964 was the Soviet deep state’s reply to this unmasking, which had revealed too much, which had yielded too much ‘truth’ to the subjects of that unhappy Empire that Bernie Sanders loved so well.My guess is that once all this blows over, the “Deep State” will convene at a “secret speech” like Khruschev’s, contemplate its errors, and tighten up their system of illusion so essential to the subjugation of a people.

                http://sultanknish.blogspot.com/2018/01/this-civil-war-my-south-carolina-tea.html?m=1Yup, it’s war.The question that confronts us is the same one posed at the Revolution:“Who runs this country?”“Whether it’s Federal or State, Executive, Legislative or Judiciary, the left moves power around to run the country. If it controls an institution, then that institution is suddenly the supreme power in the land.…The left’s system is that any part of government that it runs gets total and unlimited power over the country.…Parts of the Shadow Government aren’t even in the government. They are wherever the left holds power. It can be in the non-profit sector and among major corporations. Power gets moved around like a New York City shell game. Where’s the quarter? Nope, it’s not there anymore.The shadow government is an ideological network. These days it calls itself by a hashtag #Resistance. Under any name, it runs the country.”—–My word, your statement about the post-Stalin ‘Truth and Reconciliation Commissions’ is excellent.  A deep vein in a few words.

        I’ve known some of these Africans with college degrees quite well. They often come here on various international and domestic programs to do graduate work at US universities.In engineering, at least, they are much more often than not substandard. But that doesn’t matter. US universities need “black bodies” to satisfy diversity requirements, and if they  have to import them, well, that is fine.Of course, US companies and government entities need “black bodies” too, to occupy technical positions. Let’s be blunt. We have a hard time scrounging up any domestically produced “black bodies” containing black brains that can cut it technically, even with all sorts of help and special giveaways. So the imports fill these needs.These “black bodies” bring their culture with them. I cannot say for sure what portion of it is genetic, and what portion is learned, but suffice it to say that these “black bodies” fulfill every stereotype you’ve ever read in any essay on the African mindset.

            I worked at a law firm one summer in 1967 with two African Harvard graduate students–Kenya and Uganda. I was only 19 but astonished by how lazy and stupid they were. Not African stupid I grant you, but normal stupid.

                I had the privilege of spending time with Africans long before race realism was a thing that was recognized by most – in the pre-internet era.But reflecting back on my experiences then I’m astounded at how much correspondence there is between the experiences I had with those guys, and the summaries of the African character expressed in essays like “What I Learned in the Peace Corps in Africa: Trump Is Right” and similar works, that are now available to all online.I’ve since encountered Africans working with consulting firms, and they pretty much check all the boxes on the stereotypes as well. One thing has been left out though.These guys may be idiots, but put them in a position with a little authority, and they become miniature tin pot dictators full of themselves. They’re insufferable assholes, and of course everyone just has to tolerate them because, well because they’re “black bodies,” and all right-thinking firms who wish to continue to receive federal contracts must employ a certain number of black bodies.

        This was your best podcast ever. Your summary of the basic relationship between blacks and whites (which, sadly, cannot be shared in polite company, since it is too harsh and real) cannot be refuted except with the charge of racism, which is an “argument” as effective as a kneel-down at the end of lost football game.What irritates me about charlatans like Ta-Nehisi Coates is how inferior their literary product is to the occasional black of the real America (the old, weird America that Bob Dylan says he admires) such as WEB Dubois, Ralph Ellison, or James Baldwin. These were sharp men who wrote well and were in all likelihood smarter than many of us. But under the iron heel of the modern Leftism – that force that enriches a subliterate jackass like Coates – these writers are “awkward”.Ellison was especially aware of this fact: White liberals don’t want you to be a human being, they want you to be a ‘black man.’ Thus the title of his masterpiece: Invisible Man. If you’re black, everything you do or say is only interesting to us as it relates to your blackness. Elllison found this to be the fate of living among blacks and whites… it’s a great novel and my bet is that no black people read it today.Ellison’s favorite American novel was Huck Finn. That’s a fact. Modern SWPL ideology requires that blacks in America hate the land of their birth. It’s a pity for them. Say what you will about native-born black people, they – like us legacy whites – have a right to be here. This is their country; they are no more African than I am English or French or Dutch. The Left plays fast and loose with racial concepts: If I don’t want an invasion of Somalis in my town, it means “I hate blacks”. And the native blacks, my fellow countrymen, whose ancestry in this country may very well precede mine, being the simple and easily manipulated souls they are, and whose interests are probably more at risk by the invasion of Somalis than mine, seem to agree. Zman is right – hatred of whitey is the thing. Thus relatively affluent and civilized indigenous blacks root for the invasion of their own land by savages from primitive parts of Africa, to stick it to whitey.As always in the genesis of ideas, this is a cultural Marxist idea absorbed from white leftists. Blacks are not people – they are tools in a greater project.Ta-Nehisi Coates is the spawn of white leftists; my guess is that he knows this, in some corner of his mind, but the money and privilege that goes with being a “magic negro” makes it all worthwhile – the way 19-year-old hotties do porn to rake in the money for a year or two, despite their lingering qualms as to personal integrity.

        Title IX is the blueprint for a Marxist thought experiment becoming lawfare, forcing men into the Zumbeck suit of the feminine imperative, thus polarizing the alphas and betas.  Generation Zyklon is the child of this polarization.  The war rages on.

        “Jug-eared clodhopper” puts a big smile on my face each time I hear it. Beautiful turn of phrase. Outstanding, award winning ring of truth. One of your best podcasts, ever. Factual. Insightful. Truth filled even. On time and under budget. IF only you’d speak more slowly…. that way my depressed/ down-clocked hitler phone could keep up!

        I was catching up on your podcasts and in Ep. 28:http://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=12620in the ”sportsball” section you mention Jalen Brown of the Boston Celtics whining about ”I’ve had people come to basketball games dressed in monkey suits with a jersey on.”. Perhaps he’s confusing thehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns#Suns_mascotwith a fan (he’s a team employee, at least he’s indoors and in air conditioning, think about those poor mascots for baseball, football and those costumed Disney characters – that IS hell). For those who don’t know, the Suns furry, err, mascot, is a guy in a gorilla suit – wearing a Suns player uniform. From Wiki:”Nowadays, the Suns Gorilla is one of the most famous mascots in the NBA.Affectionately nicknamed “Go” and towering at a whopping five-foot “ape”, the Gorilla is the Phoenix Suns favorite primate. Most notably, fans are familiar with the Gorilla for his on the court antics where he raises the Phoenix Suns flag in the name of team-pride, performs notorious slam dunk routines and fires up the crowd. From his early days in the Banana Republic to his education at Fur-man University, the Gorilla has always had a passion for basketball.” But then again, what do you expect from an African. At least he ain’t looting and burning…

        You mention that modern Greeks do not resemble ancient Greeks because of the lack of different eye colors and hair colors. That is not true. I recently visited Greece and was surprised to see the vast assortment of red-heads and blondes, many with blue eyes, green eyes, etc.

            Modern Greeks share 75% of the ancient’s DNA, which may have mainly been the deposit of invading northern Teutonic tribes– blond, red, and blue as well as brown and brown. Except for the Attics, who were olive skinned and dark haired. 75% seems pretty good for 2k years, but maybe not for blonde and blue. Also, modern Greeks (91) do not likely share IQ with the oldsters.

                Ancient Greeks revered blondes and redheads, with frequent depictions in writings and common art (urns, murals).
