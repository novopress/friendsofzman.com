        I‚Äôve started asking the goodthinkers, with a sincerely bewildered and ignorant expression, ‚ÄúI wonder why Japan has so few Muslim attacks.‚Äù
It‚Äôs priceless to see the expressions on their little faces as they scan their minds for a good answer for me, the hillbilly and naif, and then suddenly realize that they are thinking obvious but forbidden thoughts.

        It won‚Äôt end well because the rock, which is muslims‚Äô perpetual (more than 1400 years) use of violence to inflict their ways on any society, will meet the hard place of Americans, and maybe Britons, who don‚Äôt have a history of tolerating conquest by 3d world savages‚Ä¶..But the cloud people think they can retreat to their private islands and heavily guarded enclaves and lecture us from there. If they can, because Americans have been too pacified by their propaganda, America loses everything. If they can‚Äôt, there will be no mercy extended by those who have done the fighting‚Ä¶.

        We are the victims of Munchausen by proxy committed by the cloud. They need a reason to feel important so they poison society and then set about prescribing solutions for us. They call us the patient when they are the ones who are sick.

        Story One: Build It and They Will Come ‚Ä¶ and come.Sometimes doing something about the bum problem only makes it worse.  I live in a small city near a big city.  The big city gives bums free bus tickets to our small city where they congregate along a river in makeshift campsites.  Occasionally, a bum will drown if the river rises fast, or a hapless jogger will be raped, but for the most part, the bums panhandled all day and slept by the river all  night.‚Ä¶ until the do-gooders got power.  The do-gooders, armed with tax dollars, decided to build a fancy shelter.  Next to the fancy shelter is a Catholic feeding place and a Lutheran illegal immigrant ‚Äúresettlement‚Äù house.  Also, there are a few cheap hotels, where, I‚Äôve heard, larger families are ‚Äúresettled.‚ÄùInstead of tens of homeless, we now have hundreds.  They roam the streets and many have no desire to sleep in the shelter.  They LIKE their tent city by the river.  They don‚Äôt want to work ‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt want to move.  And so, the expensive shelter is mostly unused, night after night.Story Two: The Homeless Guy in Boulder who runs a Homeless Shelter.I met, in a coffee shop in Boulder, an articulate though troubled-looking young man.  In conversation he told me he runs a homeless shelter in town.  We spoke at length about the homeless ‚Äúproblem‚Äù in Boulder until he blurted out that he didn‚Äôt think there was a homeless problem at all, that some people in Boulder ‚Äî this is not my hometown, by the way ‚Äî simply choose to be homeless.  I was flummoxed.  Why, I asked, would anyone choose to be homeless, particularly in the winter?He told me he was one of those homeless people who lived in a park by the Boulder library.  For him, the park was home.I said, ‚Äù But you RUN a shelter, no?‚ÄùHe shrugged his shoulders and said,  ‚ÄúSome homeless people want a shelter.‚Äù‚ÄúMost don‚Äôt.‚Äù

            Most don‚Äôt want to work. Most want three hots and a cot but without the gray bars. After that they want to be indulged in their many vices. Alcohol, drugs, sloth, porn and sex etc. All want society to provide for them while being left alone.Back when I was a cop you could stop their most egregious behavior, public defecation, drunken panhandling, theft, sex crimes, etc. Now they stop you from doing anything. About seven years ago they made an effort to bus in bums from the big city to the small town I worked at. Where before we had normal drug alcohol and sex crimes problems now we look like downtown Seattle or Portland with aggressive panhandlers bums blocking traffic, and filling the parks with needles and used condoms.When the break comes it will look like the vigilance committee days. The tar and feathers don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre rich or poor.

                I don‚Äôt know a lot about the program, but I believe the Mormons have come up with a decent way to deal with the homeless. They do expect them to work of course.
I‚Äôve never understood the term ‚Äúhomeless community‚Äù. They are homeless! By definition, they don‚Äôt have a community.

                    There are some you can help if you are willing to police their behavior. Even big cities used to have work camps for hobos and bums. They‚Äôd get dried out while they were there, do some outdoor labor and have nutritional food and a bed at night.That‚Äôs not possible any more. You can have work camps but only the most trustworthy can function without serious supervision. All of it is better than living on the streets or in the jungle camps but many want to live in those camps. The community isn‚Äôt what most of us would call a community but it is one. The rules are much more like ‚ÄòLord of the Flies‚Äô combined with Huck and Tom‚Äôs river adventures than anything civilized but they like that. They‚Äôre like Gypsies. They‚Äôve learned hownotto work for their daily bread and for most of them that‚Äôs all they want. Theft, drug dealing, panhandling, prostitution, are much easier in some ways than punching a time clock.

                    I forgot to mention I saw the first street walking prostitute in our town today by our hospital. She looked just like Moldylocks in a black leather miniskirt. Same shanky look same rail thin build same long nasty dreds.This is exactly what I left behind twenty five years ago. Now the great and good have ordained we need drug dealers, panhandlers, and crazy people. We have only twelve rooms for homeless people so they have to stuff them in hotels that used to cater to sportsmen and tourists. The locals started a neighborhood watch and taping the dirt bags as they stole, trespassed, and sold drugs. The authority‚Äôs response? Build fences so the drug dealers couldn‚Äôt be taped and threaten the locals with privacy laws. They‚Äôve brought Indians (dot not feather, we already have plenty of feathers) in but they are zero problem. No Muslims yet. This bunch of Indians hate Muslims like poison so that might be a factor.We‚Äôve gone from a nice quiet town with mills and lumberjacks to a scuzzy ghetto the only thriving businesses are selling pot, cigarettes and alcohol.

            I live in the Denver metro area. This area, including Boulder, has always had a fairly high homeless population, in no small part because drifters tend to go West. But the homeless population has exploded in the past 10 years for two reasons.First, legalized MJ draws young homeless drifters (they call themselves Urban Wanderers) like moths to a flame. There are more dispensaries in Denver than Starbucks. These kids panhandle aggressively‚Äìit‚Äôs no longer safe for a woman to walk alone in downtown Denver, even during the day.Second, Denver, a solidly blue city, has adopted the approach outlined in this article. Social Services organizations, paid for by government grants, provide food and medical services to the homeless in various locations near downtown, so the bums congregate there. Much of downtown Denver reeks of stale piss and shit, and that was *before* Denver announced they will no longer penalize people for relieving themselves in public in order to avoid tagging illegals for ICE.In fairness, soaring real estate prices and rents have driven some of those on the margin out of their homes and gentrification/redevelopment has claimed many of the seedy hotels that are often the last resort for people on the margin. Denver, once a town for cowboys and ski bums, has become a city of Cloud People from California. I‚Äôm leaving soon.

                You could say the same about Salt Lake City. It‚Äôs hard to believe that town where self-reliant Mormons once dominated the conservative political landscape has sunk into this condition. Bums everywhere.

                    Amen to that one brother.  There‚Äôs a whole homeless industry in SLC around the old train station, which is now a downtown mall.  But the whole thing smells like a good old fashioned Mormon property war.  ‚ÄúNice Mall you got there.    Be a shame if something happened to it.  Might be interested in being your partner.  Say by the way, did I mention our church is thinking about opening up a nice homeless shelter right next to it.‚Äù
Place has gone from upscale mall in prime real estate area to Bum City Bum Scene in about 3 years.

        The main arguments the left uses regarding Muslim violence (or any violence they endorse) are straight from the Soviet playbook. They‚Äôre all variations on Tu Quoque, but to be more specific, you have1) Whataboutism- Asking about some vaguely comparable act of violence from the right. For a long time, the go-to for people like Rachel Maddow was to say, ‚ÄúTimothy McVeigh.‚Äù He killed 168 people, and even though he wasn‚Äôt religious or racist, he was a white guy with a Johnny Unitas flat-top so for all intents and purposes for the left he was a white supremacist Christian fundamentalist. Of course, Muslims have killed far more people in their combined attacks just in the last decade or so, but I think Maddow and co. can squeeze a few more bits of pulp from this orange. The guy who shot up the Republican baseball game was a big fan of hers, so maybe she‚Äôll mention Timothy McVeigh again if someone points out this loony loved her as well as Bernie.2) The other preferred Tu Quoque tactic is an oldie-but-goodie called ‚ÄúAnd you are lynching negroes.‚Äù This is also of Soviet provenance (what on the left isn‚Äôt?), and while it is better used to deflect attention from commie rights abuses, it can also be used to take attention away from the fact that Muslims practice human rights abuses (either in no-go zones in Europe or in their homelands) against the people progressives claim they want to protect (gays, women, etc.). If you mention that right now Muslims are doing these things, the Leftists (with their folding timeline, as I think you‚Äôve called it) can get in their time machine (maybe a hybrid instead of a DeLorean) and they can travel back to the crusades or to the confederacy in order to try to make the argument that because conservative people once did violent things they don‚Äôt approve of, you have no right to talk about the horrible things their Muslim pets are doing right now.I frankly am not interested in arguing with these people or trying to convert them (they waved ‚Äúbye-bye‚Äù to reality a long time ago). These ‚ÄúHow to win an argument with a liberal‚Äù books by Frank Rich and Ben Shapiro sell well, so good on them, but I‚Äôm past the dialogue stage.

        At some point we have to face the very real probability that the political class (both in the US and Europe) is deliberately working to destroy social cohesion and the normal bonds of trust that enable representative government. What we are seeing is too pervasive, consistent, and sustained to be mere incompetence or corruption. Just because reality is abhorrent does mean it stops being reality.

                No, this time is characteristically different. There is an actual coup d etat in progress at the moment and the near-term goal is to foment a war of attrition between law enforcement personnel and patriotic Americans who won‚Äôt stand idly by. Once the pool of good guys is sufficiently depleted, the serious tyrants will surface as would-be messiahs. They are playing chess, and they are good at it.

                I was being sarcastic about TomA saying that ‚Äúat some point we have to face the very real possibility ‚Ä¶‚Äù as if that hasn‚Äôt already become apparent.  That has been quite apparent for some time now and has been at work since the end of WW2.  Many authors have noted such, especially those who had histories in the communist sector prior to finding their way to the U.S. as Americans of good repute.  Others have come here as communist agents to infiltrate and bring down America.

        Ten or so years ago I had significant familiarity with the San Francisco social services department.  One minor part of that department was a table manned by two retired cops, located at the central welfare office, whose job it was to provide ‚Äúfree‚Äù bus trips to homeless bums claiming they wanted to go back from whereven they said they came from.  Part of the sport was gaming this system in various ways in order to garner taxpayer funded travel.Oddly other cities were practicing the same racket, with the end result that they were shipping their bums in about twice as fast as SF could ship theirs out.The reason for this was that SF was offering at the time (and likely still is) the best benefit package for homelessness in America.  The Cloud Princes who rule the city found it extremely puzzling that their homeless ‚Äúproblem‚Äù keeps growing by leaps and bounds.  As, of course, does the myriad of heavily staffed programs designed to service that problem.From their point of view, it was a win-win.  And SF continues to turn into a public toilet with an outdoor population of dangerous lunatics.

            Serious question:  Can a ‚Äòflood the zone‚Äô strategy work in the case of ‚Äòweaponizing‚Äô bums against Denver, Boston, San Francisco, etc. as well as it is working for Qatar and the Moslem Brotherhood using ‚Äòweaponized moslem migrants‚Äô against the UK_?  IOW, every red state to give every bum a free one-way bus ticket to the same regional urban bum magnet on an orchestrated basis so as to serially bankrupt them_?Of course, it would be necessary to neutralize the obvious counter-tactic already in use, mentioned above, of SF giving the bums a ticket out.  It should prove easy enough to make any bum‚Äôs boomerang arrival unpleasant enough that they‚Äôd refuse the offer to return from SF.  I‚Äôm not talking human rights abuse here.  Just a night or two in an under-heated, drug-free, bologna-sandwich-on-wonderbread menu detention center should do the trick. This should be followed by a one-way return ticket to the bum in question‚Äôs point of origin.Hey, this just might work for the malignant moslem migrants too_!  The morons in charge of the UK have just admitted that their zone has been well and truly flooded such that their forces using conventional quasi-police state tactics are overwhelmed.  Maybe they could figure this out_!  Nah, who am I kidding,

                    Other Al;My possibly poorly stated idea was to focus the pain of homeless policy stupidity exclusively on its blue-metro advocates via a concerted strategy of making them deal with its bad results exclusively.  Right now they are being allowed to  disperse said bad/sad consequences throughout red-land.  And, it turns out that the strategic dialectic leads straight to what ought to be a viable approach to the malignant moslem migrant threat: Take the fun and profit out of it for the individual migrant as well as for their sending location.And such an approach is well short of the sort of ethnic cleansing that characterized the end of WWII in E Europe and in the Balkans in the 1990‚Äôs.  But we know the Cloud folk won‚Äôt do the former, actually workable and relatively humane (albeit partial) solution now and so will end up with the latter ‚Äòsolution‚Äô later, if only to stay a step ahead of the mob baying for their blood.As far as keeping undesirables constantly on the move as the solution (one that I wasn‚Äôt advocating), I can‚Äôt help thinking of the old joke about the chicken farmer on his way to market who thought he could beat the truck weight scale by banging on the side of the truck so the chickens would be flying about inside and their weight wouldn‚Äôt register.

            Atlanta did the same thing prior to the ‚Äô96 Olympics. A bus ticket to whatever destination and $100 to get on it.The move to close mental asylums began in the late 60‚Äôs in California, from a combination of Psychiatrists claiming that the then-new drugs could treat even the worst of the mentally ill and ‚Äùreintroduce‚Äù them into society. As another commenter noted, Republicans were on board due to the perceived cost savings. Of course, all it did was shift them problem to the streets and the criminal justice system.

            And you would be right. I moved to SF from Boston ten years ago and in that time have seen the homeless/bum situation go from bad to worse. I recently saw a post on my Gab feed that attached a poop map to the city. As expected, the downtown area had it the worst, but even out here at the beach, we‚Äôre not immune.Two things have had an especially large effect on the situation: the tech boom and huge construction projects. All those Google and Fakebook techies don‚Äôt want the suburban sprawl of the peninsula, they want bars and restaurants that are frequented by their own, in trendy neighborhoods. Luxury high rises are being built South of Market, near a new public transportation terminal and the ballpark. The new Financial District has drifted south to match.One of the major movers and shakers in the homeless racket doesn‚Äôt even live in the City. She gets to go home to Sausalito and leave us holding the bag. But any discussion of the current situation and this person is out and attacking, chewing on your leg like a wolverine for even suggesting that the whole thing is thoroughly intolerable. Meanwhile we who commute on MUNI have to put up with smelly, ranting, mentally ill people, hoping you‚Äôre not their next victim du jour. At least Boston‚Äôs crappy winter weather would give folks a respite from the homeless. Here, not so much.

        Back in the seventies our illustrious Governor Mike Dukakis decreed that mental institutions were inhumane. They would close all these terrible state-run institutions and then place the mentally ill in group homes sprinkled about the Commonwealth.Case workers would be hired to help these mentally deficient individuals back into normal society. Trouble was they only implemented part one. They closed all the mental institutions , but never relocated those individuals to group homes or hired any case workers to monitor them.The mentally insane relocated underneath bridges and self-medicated with cheap alcohol. Of course insanity and alcohol is a bad mix. Most find their way to the prison system.Recently one of the lunatics went berserk and the correction officers were forced to restrain him. He coded out during the struggle and dropped dead. Immediately the do-gooders blame the officers and not the bum‚Äôs lifetime use of drugs and alcohol.They‚Äôve now removed the officers and the criminally insane will be monitored by case workers. Can‚Äôt wait to see how this is going to work out.Really wish the cloud people were only adhering to their politically correct beliefs with the muslim invasion, but it‚Äôs a global crisis and looks a little too carefully orchestrated.Despite attack after attack from these murderous savages ( 9/11 anyone ? ) world leaders are steadfast with the continuing insanity.Replacing white‚Äôs with a low IQ workforce ?  How do they plan on keeping the country running with all these exploding Mohameds ?Do the elites really want to model the country after the Middle East ? Just mind baffling üôÅ

        ‚ÄúThis one is all on the Cloud People, but they can‚Äôt bring themselves to face the cause of the problem.‚ÄùThey continue to bring in Muslims because it serves two purposes:1) It will breed out the Whites that the ((in group)) hates.2) It is a money maker for the contractors who import and resettle these Muslims (and the Exploding Mohammeds) in a home near you.Those contractors are largely religious organizations like Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services, Episcopal Migration Ministries, Hebrew Immigration Aid Society (HIAS), Chruch World Service, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and four secular ones: Ehiopian Community Development Council, International Rescue Committee, and US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants.It is darkly amusing that the so called ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù churches are working hard against its traditional congregants in order to make the almighty dollar. All of the above organizations are funded by the US State Department and ultimately, by tax payers like us.The Cloud People will not have to worry about the exploding Mohammeds because the Muslims are resettled near the dirt people. The exploding Mohammeds will not be allowed into the Cloud People‚Äôs gated communities. Cloud People can afford armed security. The rest of us don‚Äôt matter.

Clever or not, I find it very hard to believe that senior people in the security services are unaware that more Mohammed means more security services.
I agree that the religious explanation is a good one for the chattering classes and ordinary liberals. Listen to any NPR story on immigration and you‚Äôll hear it clear as day.

We read a lot about how what we see happening in the western world is all part of elaborate leftist (globalist, satanist, cthulhu, whatever) plots to undermine society and take over. Nope‚Ä¶they‚Äôre not that clever.IMHO most of what ails us is the inevitable result of the Peter Principle run amok. Like a herd of deer no longer kept in check by the wolf, we are busting out all over and subgroups that would never proliferate in a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù world are busy expanding their numbers. If you know anything about population dynamics, Zman‚Äôs admonition that this will not end well takes on a rather depressing connotation. The big question is: are humans uniquely immune from the forces which drive all the other populations of critters on Earth? Guess we‚Äôll see.

                Actually I consider all those ‚Äúconspiracies‚Äù you raised more evidence to my point. The only reason those are even considered as serious social issues is because our scum has risen to the top, and instead of seeing reality they exist in some bizarro-world alternate universe.

                I generally agree.  The inner party, the true cloud people (who I once heard described as the ‚Äúout of sight rich‚Äù), are driven by reason and will to power.

                        There is strong evidence that NRO is mired deep in financial quicksand.  They could probably solve their problems rather quickly by encouraging the return of Steyn and Derb, along with some of the other pariahs they created.  But they won‚Äôt, because what they are smoking is of a religious nature as well.

                            More accurately: They won‚Äôt because their is a choice between meager pay and no pay. The option does not exist for any presently situated ‚Äúestablishment,‚Äù rag to defect. The act of defection is itself an act of professional suicide because having a presence in the monetizable mainstream requires loyalty to the Cloud (or loyalty to the Tribe, as the case may be).This rubs up against what I consider to be the most recurrent theme in the dissident right. Why are the cucks so unabashedly servile? We even know that some of them had more ‚Äúedgy,‚Äù opinions in the not-too-distant past. Where have all the brave quasi-elites gone?The answer is that the same centralization process that gave us six media conglomerates running the whole mainstream show also gave us the de facto irreversability of political correctness. Once an idea is sold to the Cloud People, so long as said idea remains in good standing, it cannot be walked back without reprisal. Allowing as much would be tantamount to the ultimate reversal of that centralization.You get one media outlet, an add agency, and a payment processor working independently of the herd and like wildfire the new ideas will find their market and begin to replicate out of control. Look at the kind of ad traffic revenues denied to the alt-right websites. There are untold millions in those fertile fields, but the Cloud demands they lay fallow lest a blight spread to their own crops.Herein lies the conundrum. One can try as they might to end-run the system with small donations and other cooperative funding measures, but in the intervening years that matter (one to two decades time, at which point new demographics become cemented in the west) the Cloud either becomes aware of the problems in their system or they do not.Without some buy-in from the Cloud, at least from some qasi-powerful allies in the outer-rim, I suspect the trajectory of the West will not improve.

                            In the US it seems the opposite, Libertarians, to me, seem to have an early infatuation with Rand and go to their present philosophy. Not that they ever really shed the Randian part.

                    Libertarianism was a an appeal to return to Constitutional liberties under federalism, before the rise of the American Soviet.The libertarian mistake- my own- was Universalism, and nostalgia.Like assuming such high trust values are possible without a dominant White population and all that implies, such as a Christian tradition, local autonomy and production, etc.If libertarians combine the appeal to liberty within the natural virtues of civilized homogenous populations, the marketing will be unbeatable.Right now it‚Äôs effectively dividing natural allies, as Conservative Inc. was designed to do.(Plus, it‚Äôs boring to read the same thing over and over and over.All theory, little examination of why and how criminals rule us.‚ÄúBe nice!

                        I‚Äôm afraid I have to disagree, I get the appeal of leave m,e alone but it doesn‚Äôt workLibertarian thinking  requires a homogeneous  moral probably religious population to work otherwise its just oligarchy and the vast majority of people end up withe the company store taking all their liberty instead of the state. Tyranny is tyranny no matter who does itOn top of that there is a ton of profit, or was at least in moral degeneracy . Pimping ain‚Äôt easy but its good money and so is slinging legal dope , smut, exploiting the poor, tons of pure bottom feeder crap we don‚Äôt needNow of course we can get the a an ethnically homogeneous  by mass deportation or less humane means but you can‚Äôt make the USA into a moral country or a culturally homogeneous one   by means of force and have anything approaching a Libertarian societyAlso Libertarianism is at its core the ethos of chiselers , its another dodge to avoid the high cost of paying for a functional developed civilizationThis chiseling while far from optimum can work when the technological development level is low when most people are small business owners and small hold farmers , it worked after a fashion till the late 19th century but only to a fashionThe immigration crisis and slavery were essentially caused by the grifters wanting cheap labor and of course crisis after crisis, the consonant cyclic depressions and panics  of the 19th century were part and parcel of this ethos.However once a society reaches a certain level of development, costs go up and they have to be born by people who have money or society can stop working or both as we are starting to see.This means either pay good wages and tax everyone a fiat amount or eat the rich, choose wisely.The thing is automation while it makes goods cheaper also means people have  less means to actually purchase all that productionMarx was an idiot but  his crisis theory isn‚Äôt entirely wrong and every Craigslist (employs 35 people, laid off 35000) or automated truck venture is essentially a vote for ‚ÄúRed or Unfed‚ÄùAnd no you can‚Äôt opt out, essentially  too much automation is going to mandate either collapse  or socialism unless its regulatedIts already got us huge numbers of people unemployed, on benefits or underemployed.On top of that leftism is ultimately always subversiveThis means an authoritarian populism which we aren‚Äôt ready for and it probably means the Ayn Rand Jihad will have to be dealt with tooDo it right and you can have some freedom and prosperity but you can never have a Libertarian society.Sorry.

How then to predict this brave new world?  Many models, but none fit modern conditions.And more, the Great Stories that move us are most often great lies.
What surprises me is that all we know is wrong, yet we try our best regardless, and still achieve miraculous good.

        Either they are mindless drones following the principles of their religion, or they are carrying out an elaborate plan to keep the bums away from CoffeeBucks and flood the suburbs with low income HUD housing to destroy property values and ethnically cleanse white working class citizens.
It‚Äôs not either-or, it‚Äôs both.

        I think it would be worth mentioning that the mental institutions were closed primarily BECAUSE they had become a taxpayer-funded hangout for bums who wanted to be fed and housed but didn‚Äôt want to work (and many still there who wanted to evade the drafts a decade prior, re: Cuckoo‚Äôs Nest.  Kesey didn‚Äôt just make that crap up.  He hated the institutions but also noted that they were FILLED with people who were avoiding the draft, avoiding real-life issues, or had destroyed themselves with acid-trips.).

                        I always forget I shouldn‚Äôt start a battle of wits with an unarmed kid.  I have work, I‚Äôm sure Karl that your mommy will make you go to grade school at some point today, unless she‚Äôs too busy sucking for crack.  I‚Äôm sure if you run to HuffPo and DailyKos for your info, libs like yourself will read how mean-ol‚Äô Reagan the Lionhearted closed mental institutions because he hated mentally ill people.  Institutions were closed for three reasons:  1.) A new development in anti-depressants.  Most ‚Äúinsane‚Äù people were simply overdiagnosed.  2.) A horrific legacy of abuse at taxpayer expense, with few people being ‚Äúcured.‚Äù  3.)  Most important, and constantly hidden by the media, the hospitals were filled with bums, drug-addicts, and draft-dodgers.  Now, your beloved liberal media might drop hints at number 2 if they can find a way to pin it on conservatives, but will completely and ‚Äúconveniently‚Äù forget to mention 1 and 3.  My post was to remind people that the media narrative of ‚Äúmean ol‚Äô Reagan‚Äù is not the whole story.  Kesey actually wrote SOME of the truth into his story, a broken clock is right twice a day and a liberal can‚Äôt push lies without an occasional grain of truth.

        Millennia of inbreeding guarantees the assimilation of Habib in a culture such as ours.  They are an  evolutionary dead end.  They are merely an element in the culture crucible, consumed as a new paradigm emerges.  The boomerang of unintended consequences is the curse of cultural marxism.

        So Vortigern, hires a bunch of Saxon mercy. One boat load of Hengist and Horsas later and we‚Äôre speaking a Germanic language instead of a Celtic one of Latin.
So our modern day Vortigerns have brought them in by the boatload. Obama et al knew the Muslims were going to have us speaking Arabic. Does our new god emperor?

        It is the aspect of anarcho-tyranny that most people don‚Äôt get right away.
The term ‚Äúanarcho-tyranny‚Äù is oxymoronic at best. I respectfully recommend ‚Äúchaotic tyranny‚Äù as a direct substitute ‚Äî or just ‚Äútyranny‚Äù, perhaps, as the modifier is superfluous, to begin with.
