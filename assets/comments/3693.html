        I’ve read everything quoted in this post, and more from the War Nerd, or on Gary Brecher / John Dolan. It’s quite plausible that Dolan’s wife influenced some of his ideas (my current one does and my previous relations did, too), but other than that, I fail to see the relation between the textual evidence and the argument. Indeed, I’m not sure it’s very clear, other than ‘oh, the guy uses a pseudonym’ (duh) or ‘I don’t believe he lived in Kuwait’ (why not?) and ‘his wife wrote this stuff’ (maybe, if we were in the 19th Century – no woman writing this stuff nowadays would accept that her husband sign it himself). Isn’t it much more probable than a smart misfit got serially fired from precarious Academic jobs – in my experience, a common occurrence – and made a mild success of what was initially a fun blog?Btw, who are YOU, thezman? Can we assume that you actually exist, or are you a figment of your own imagination?

        SqtBob,
“Right out of the shoot …” is a gag I regularly employ just to have some fun. I’ll also spell “guerrilla war” as “gorilla war.” It makes people crazy, but I find it entertaining. If you keep reading, you’ll find other little gags like that from me. I have a lot of them.

        “Right out of the shoot …” As a pun, it fails. “Chute,” as in a rodeo cowboy on a horse or bull.

        Real warriors have an air of authenticity about them that is hard to co-opt.  They rarely brag about heroic deeds if they mention any deeds at all. Z and K – as usual your B.S. detectors are properly calibrated.

        Plus, look at the guy. He looks like Michael Moore raped the lead character from Confederacy of Dunces.
I always figured he was a basement geek who’d read hundreds of war books and had an above average IQ but zero military training or combat experience. He wrote with false bravado, like a PUA but about war.

        Thanks Kathy. It is so good to know everyone has a “BS detector” of full charge and us poor saps who just think people are people are soooo easily duped. And thanks for being OK about it. Wow, I can feel the love from here.

        Thank God a _dude_ finally said it, because when I used to complain about this guy going back almost 10 years, well… anyhow…
My b.s. detector isn’t 100% but there was something phoney about him.  A lot of anti-war libertarians had man-crushes on him, because he validated their existing beliefs.
(And not sure why anyone would be “grateful” for fakery and having been conned, but ok. See above I guess.)

            The other thing that sent my BS meter off was “I’m guessing the woman and her fighters are Tajik, from the north side of the big watershed…” It’s vague enough to avoid a fact checker, but implies a first hand knowledge. There’s simply no way this guy could know that. It just reminds me of listening to fake war stories from guys who flew a desk, but like to bore the hell out of people with tales from their days in the service.As I said, I could be wrong, but the more I look at his writing, the less inclined I am to take it at face value.Kathy’s point about antiwar libertarians is a good one. A whole lot of otherwise sensible people were driven mad by the Muslim Wars of the last 15 years.

        If War Nerd is a fake — and nothing should surprise me these days on tinterwebz –then I am sorry to hear it. I used to like some of his columns about what war was. Not the glorified, prettied version dished out by Pollywood but the fact that there were (and are) some awful and brutal things going on in the wide world.
But, if he be a fake, all I can say is he did it well for a time. For that alone I am grateful.
