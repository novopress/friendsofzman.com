        I am old enough to remember the dire warnings of the ’70s that we were sinking (sliding?) into a new ice age. But then Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace and all the other assorted cookies and nut cases began instead to blather about global heating (and with it, alter ‘scientific’ information to suit their cause) and panic the hard-of-thinking lefties into galloping round in their private jets screaming we were all going to die from the heat.Of course, we all know that warmth allows things to grow but the cold kills. That is as in ‘kills stone dead.’ Still, as each year we must be treated to propaganda of ‘the warmest week/month/year on record’ perhaps any data on the forthcoming cold weather will be smoothly doctored to prove that what we are getting will be the warmest blizzards known to man and hottest pack ice on record.Oh yes, and we can have unlimited immigration of polar bears in the UK!

            That’s why they went from using global warming to “climate change”.
And like the war on un-equality, the war on change can go on forever!

        Off topic, did you seethe latest on Neil Tyson? He fabricated quotes and now wikipedia is covering it up, deleting all references to the matter, even defending it:“Ok, he slightly misquoted a moron (GWB), doesn’t matter, science is still real!”And another:“At this point I don’t have a problem with *any* slandering of GWB.”It’s like when El Rushbo is intentionally “misquoted” almost every week, and when called out the response is yeah but still… we know he is evil in our hearts!But i guess those editors need something to do until the mother-ship arrives.You were spot on calling him a clown.And rememberClimategate &amp; the corruption of Wikipedia?The featured wikipedia editor and green party member, who created or rewrote 5000 unique wikipedia articles on global warming, is still fully going at it!Undoing things in the “Climate change denial” entry even as of today!What a joke.
