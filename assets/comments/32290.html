        This is the West all over: No reason to exist. What is America? What is Germany? What is Britain?No one has a concrete answer. Sure, there’s talk of democracy and Western values such as freedom of speech, but these are just words that no one believes anymore. We live in societies that have lost their purpose. We are not bound by ancestry, culture or history; indeed, our leaders work tirelessly to break us from those things.The West must find enemies because, otherwise, we have no reason to exist, which is why our leaders will never stop poking Russia, China and everyone else. They have no choice. To look inward would be to see the emptiness of what the West has become.

                i’m thinking they must’ve been forced(by their zio-overlords) to have anal intercourse with blackies to get their positions, that’s why they’re pushing rainbow flag and negro worship on us.
They’re spiteful we didn’t degrade ourselves like they did.

                The Rainbow flag crap is just a symptom of our theocracy’s emphasis on inclusion – which, itself, is a very feminine and Jewish way of thinking. Both women and Jews are terrified of being excluded so they made inclusion the focus of the subversion of white societies.
Other races aren’t so stupid or as easily tricked on this issue as whites. We either reject inclusion or we (correctly) get thrown into the dustbin of history.

                    Whites, especially Northern European Whites, rank as the lowest in ethnocentrism and are the most welcoming people in the world.  Jews really found their sweet spot to conduct their plans to import foreigners.

                    Kind of ironic, that “inclusion” would be considered a jewish hangup when jews are the most exclusive of all others. Or is it a case of inclusion of me, but not of thee?

                Communities with a purpose – their people and culture – will emerge from the pointless multi-everything bazaar that is the West. It’s inevitable. The West offers nothing for the soul and, certainly, nothing for whites.Trust in the system is falling, faster than even I expected. That’s Stage 1. Stage 2 is whites trying to save the system, which is what we’re watching now. People like Rufo and Anton are trying to convince non-whites and Jews to embrace colorblind civic nationalism and to stop beating on whites. It won’t work.At that point, whites will face a choice. Live in a soulless society that offers nothing but materialism and hatred for you or spend your time and live your life with people who matter to you and with whom you feel comfortable. The country will become more regional and within those regions, more focused on local communities. They won’t be openly “whites only,” but that’s what they’ll end up being.

                The past is what got us to this point. We should honor what’s good from our past and condemn what brought us here. One thing for sure, the future won’t be colorblind.

            The Russians have an ancient theory that Moscow is the Third Rome, meaning it is the third and final home of true Christianity. Rome and Constantinople both fell to the barbarians, and with Mehmet’s conquest in 1453, the mantle of the Holy See was translated to Moscow.That theory is debatable, of course. But what is less contestible is that western civilization itself has found a resting place in Russia. Over the millennia, western civilization has been battered and bruised, subjugated and weakened, but always managed to survive. The latest, and perhaps most mortal threat, comes from postmodern fascism and is instantiated in anti-white racism and copious non-white immigrantion into the traditional homeland of western civilization, Europe. The barbarians hordes of the past–Germanic tribes, Avars, Huns, Mongols, Turks–are now followed up by African and south Asian savages. Meanwhile, the white ruling class daily spits upon western traditions, customs, culture and history, fairly inviting the savages to stable their goats and camels in cathedrals and concert halls. As a result, western civilization, for all intents and purposes, is dead in Europe.But just as Irish monks in the Dark Ages kept the flame of Western civilization alive until propitious conditions arrived that would allow it to burn once again, so Russia continues to nourish the remnants of our civilization. And that is why it is marked for destruction.Moscow may or may not be the third Rome, but Russia is undoubtedly the successor to Greece, and the empires of Rome and Great Britain. Let us pray Russian leaders fully understand their role and the awesome responsibility that has been vouchsafed to them.

                Putin has grown increasingly open about what your write about. It’s quite clear that the Russians understand what they face. This is why the West and our foreign rulers are so terrified of Russia.
Putin is offering an alternative, a country based on a people, culture, history and religion. The West offers materialism. Much as the Soviet Union couldn’t last if their people could see how people lived in the West. The West can’t survive if whites can see how people live in a country that whites and our culture.

                        From the standpoint of Christendom and European identity, I think it’s probably when they were strongest. On either side is globalism. Pax Romana, Pax Americana, commerce, learning. Less Roman, less American, less who you are.  The top is fleeting and soon collapses. The momentum has already shifted. The way up is rough, but it’s up. Depends on your preference, I guess.

                            Hm. A very tendentious interpretation of the early middle ages, but I’m not going to hassle you about it. This is a blog, after all, not a grad school history seminar.

                                Tendentious— granted. I think Greeks, Romans, and Hebrews are given too much credit for a civ they influenced but didn’t build, and I think the timing of the Renaissance isn’t coincidental, nor that the Reformation soon followed.Yes, I’m just a guy with an interest in history, but it seems to me that Western Civ is usually portrayed as almost ad hoc, a mishmash of influences, borrowings, and thefts— as if its people didn’t bring something solid, of themselves, to it. And it sticks out to me that the period when Classical influences were at their lowest, and when the Church was probably least Judeo-Christian, used to be commonly called the Dark Ages.I think this is probably related to the problem of white identity, why it’s a mess, and why it can’t be allowed to develop beyond whiteness.

                                    But the Greeks and the Romans/Italians “are” our people. You simply don’t have western civ without the classical world. Now you may prefer the primitivity of 600 AD to glories of 100 or 1500 AD, but the fact of the matter is that the stupendous achievements of the West almost all occurred outside of the early middle ages (500-1000 AD).

                                        They were European, yes, but a different age and a different civ. And they had a lot of contact with Asia (Near East today) and Africa. I’m not sure if it’s intentional, but even the name Western Civ could imply separation from the East, and I’m very pro-Western. We seem to lose ourselves every time we go east.

                Then consider that the Russians were subject of 75 years of comprehensive, Marxist brainwashing, and an internal migration policy that had exactly the same intention as mass migration has today: destroy the tribes.
If the Russians came back as The Third Rome thirty years after the yoke came off, I’d say we’re looking pretty good too. Our history and cultural heritage is a lot cooler than Russia’s.

                        Americans will be the plurality ethnicity in the US this century out, and a spiritual revival fostering racial consciousness, will render the brown hordes insignificant, an annoying but hardly existential problem.People of European descent might be deracinated and decultured, but we have a deep, immortal roots, an almost inexhaustible fount of cultural power ready to be rediscovered and deployed at any moment.James Baldwin understood this when he stayed at a Swiss village somewhere in the fifties: he lamented that these semi-illiterate, superstitious peasants could claim ownership toa vast and rich cultural heritage that was entirely inaccessible to Baldwin.https://www.janvaneyck.nl/site/assets/files/2312/baldwin.pdf

                How is injecting frigging Chinese Communist atheist troops into frigging Belarus supposed to help Moscow become the final bastion of Christianity?

Are the Chinese Communists supposed to be Crypto-Christians?
I can’t believe that the presence of Chinese Communist troops, directly in the heart of Northern Europe, isn’t the sole thing that anyone is talking about right now.
This is how you get Attila the Hun attacking Rome, and the Mongol invasion of Persia and Mesopotamia.

As for it being in the name of the ruling party, you think the Episcopalians actually have ‘real’ Bishops. It’s just a ceremonial skin suit.Yeah, I’m a bit of a China Shill. But you’r just being a nutter when you start off on the Mongolensturm stuff.Digression: If you knew anything about the Taiping Rebellion (body count 5-10% of China’s then population and up there with the Great Leap Forward if not worse) you’d grok that Abrahamic religions are more trouble than they’re worth Out East.

            Looking inward would also shine a light on the real enemies of the West: the people currently in control of the governments and financial systems of the entire West. Nobody gets fired, de-platformed, smeared, loses their job, gets SWATed multiple times per day, or sent to pay homage to a stack of shoes for blaming runaway inflation and a declining quality of life on Russia or China.

                “Nobody gets fired, de-platformed, smeared, loses their job, gets SWATed multiple times per day, or sent to pay homage to a stack of shoes for blaming runaway inflation and a declining quality of life on Russia or China.”Which is exactly why we blame Russia and China.  It is the corporate MO.  Look at how Disney and other corporations react when they release a bad product:  You’re all bigots and hate us not because we lack talent, but because of the garbage we try to shove down your throats.  What we have is some people who realize the corporate state gravy train is ending, and others who realize they have no talent or skillz and must keep the corporate state going no matter what.  So they believe absurdities if they must.  Its why collapse is the cure.  Don’t let them Ft. Sumter you 😉

                Actually it applies to everything:American moves to the Soviet Union, comes back, nobody asks him any questions, then he kills the president……. Thinking persons response: This is BS that isn’t what happened.  Establishment response: You’re a conspiracy theorist!America runs a bubble from the late 70’s until current day, it pops for the first time in at the end of the .com “boom”.  Suddenly two towers in NYC are rammed by airplanes, most of the hijackers are from SA.  So we invade Iraq (they gots oil) and afghanistan (drugs for the CIA to move and right on Russias border)  Thinking person: i don’t buy your story.Tech bubble gets reflated due to an entirely new department being created at the federal level (DHS) and unjustified wars in two countries.  Bubble then moves to real estate and pops again in 2008.  Thinking person response:  Mass fraud occurred in the real estate industry and some of the largest corporations were massive beneficiary.  No bailouts and jailtime is just the ticket!  Response from government, pay out 100 cents on the dollar for all the bad bets, fire no one who matters and nobody goes to jail.  Point this out:  You’re a conspiracy theorist!2019 reflated bubble begins to burst (ten year car loans, student debt, and housing have all been over saturated again)  Trouble pops up in the treasury repo market in the fall.  ( this was after the markets started crashing again in December of 2018, rates start to get cut again thruout 2019, QT stops, and by september of 2019 they’re QE’ing again, they just didn’t announce it)  Suddenly we have a virus where everything must be shut down and everyone is helicopter dropped money, student loans are put on pause for over two years, morgates and rentals don’t have to pay anymore (even though if you got laid off you were being paid in the range of 50k in unemployment benefits!?!?!?).  Thinking person: you want me to believe all our problems are because of a virus i got and never felt worried i was going to die because of?  The one my 95 year old grandma caught and didn’t miss a beat?  Jesus christ, i know alot of us are stupid and they just figure they can pull anything over on us but god damn.It’s all been the same bubble, since the 80’s.  When this sucker goes we all go with it, make sure the finger is pointed at the right people.  Its going to suck, but lets at least blame those who deserve it.  AI is hype and is not going to save your investments.

            could the bear be the savior of europe?  with unchecked migration throughout europe it is inevitable white christian civil citizens seek relief from the star and crescent.  i wonder does russia suffer from the same social upset we see in europe and west?  sure, it is upsetting to think overall russian quality of life has surpassed europe.  seems to me russia is maintaining some semblance of civility.  am i wrong?

            Citizen:  Spot on.Rewrite a people’s history, denigrate their customs and traditions, flood and overwhelm them with aliens, destroy theirreligious faith, and shatter their communities.  All the ties that bind a people – slashed and discarded.  And suddenly they have no purpose in life as individuals or as a nation.  Why work or accumulate wealth if it will be taken and given to strangers?  Why hold to norms of behavior if there are no benefits to doing good and no consequences to evil?

        Well done Z – but this loops us back to the popular dissident stance that the system is producing slugs like Biden, the neocons and other turd brained rackateers when it’s exactly the opposite. There is nothing wrong with the system that can’t be fixed with the replacement of the Cloud People – and some legislative tweaks to prevent them from gaining access to the levers of power and gubbimint. There simply is no ‘system’ that can possibly work with people like these at the helm, or having a say in how things are run. People forget that this system was put in place by serious men to be run by serious men. The guys running it now are clowns, perverts, and cretins.We also need some objectivity about the old Soviet Union. In their day, they were hellbent on expansionism too. That is why half the world is using their weapons and tactics when they attack western states and interests. Stalin, Kruschev and their ilk were not nice people and the west was entirely correct to oppose them in the early stages of the Cold War. It is a matter of historical fact that the old soviet countries – and indeed, Russia itself – only became prosperous once they started emulating portions of the American economic model.This is also cause for my optimism about the future. Yes, short term, things look bad. Yes, we are in for a collapse, a period of dire economic times, and possibly a pitched war with the leaders and adherents of the old regime. The good news is that they are not capable of producing any state of long term prosperity or productivity. We saw this in the Soviet Union when it collapsed. But they rallied after the old guard was removed,and a generation of instability and economic depression. Say what you want about Putler – he kicked the jews out of his nation’s finances, he took good economic gambles, and simply put his own people and interests first. Now he has the world’s third largest economy and third strongest currency – all while in a pitched, costly war with NATO. In a space of – wat? 5 or 10 years?There was nothing he did that we ourselves can’t do. Neoliberalism has failed, not us. Already the cracks are widening. This shite will stop when we put an end to it.

            “he kicked the jews out of his nation’s finances, he took good economic gambles, and simply put his own people and interests first.”And they have never forgiven him for it which is why they are willing to start nuclear conflagration because of the levels of sociopathy and long term grudge holding these tribal parasites possess. The current Ukraine setup with the lefty Kagan, Nuland, etc. joining forces with the Neocon right warhawks tells you that at the end of the day, it willalwaysbe Team J first before any other consideration.Be certain they will bring the entire house down on their own heads as well here in the West before they give upanypower.

            “We also need some objectivity about the old Soviet Union…”I don’t see anyone saying different. The old USSR repressed Christianity in favor of the false religion of Marxism and it was Marxism fighting for hearts and minds that went around the world competing with Capitalism–whose inherent failures at the time were not apparent.  They are now.  Ironically, both the USSR and USA systems have similar failures, the overwhelming one being pathological egalitarianism, and its bastard step child—equity.Back to the point however, Putin seems to recognize such.  He is no Marxist.  One of his first efforts upon taking office way back was to seek a relationship with the Orthodox Christian Church of Russia.  In the West, the church has been absorbed into the prevailing Leftist agenda and in doing so, their pews lay empty.

                Perhaps I misunderstood our esteemed blog host, C. There is a reason for slow kids like me to sit at the back of the class.Off topic but maybe tangential to our adversarial relationship with Russia is that in today’s world, the might of the superpowers is largely measured by economics rather than militarily. I am personally convinced that this is the only reason NATO is still around: it exists to provide a workaround to deal with Russia economically as well as militarily. The NATO countries have banded together to sanction Russia and kneecap their potential and ever growing market influence in the west. We saw this when the Nordstream pipelines were mined. Were it not for economics I strongly suspect NATO would cease to exist. The current Ukrainian gong show is largely an effort on the part of Clown World to convince everyone of the need for and the expansion of NATO.I will not be surprised one bit if NATO ceases to exist after the war in ‘Kraine is resolved. Further, I will expect our former allies to break with us and go with Russia.

                    No argument Filthie.  I’m perhaps overreacting to (possibly) comparing Putin and the new Russia to the old USSR.  My general thinking is—as has been mentioned—Russia may indeed be hated because it perhaps remains the embodiment of the last, or at least largest, White, Christian nation of the West.  In that it is to be hated and must be destroyed.

            It should be Z’s Law: Libertarians are wrong.In the gaps where government fails to fund immigration via welfare or charity cutouts, businesses and churches step in and fund it directly.To all Western institutions—state, military, industry, and religion—the destruction of the West has infinite value.Economics explains nothing (except petty crime).Or, current_West exists in a temporary extra-economic bubble because [insert story], but reality (libertarianism) will reassert itself once Thiel and his pals become so rich and powerful that the rest of us, starving on bug rations in bug-hive prison cities policed by racial enemies who outnumber us by orders of magnitude, must rise up and restore civilization—as is our destiny! (as men already so defeated we don’t bother breeding)Could be either.

            And in that pithy statement you’ve pointed out the major flaw in Libertarian ideology.  Just about every major Libertarian tenet leads back to the “welfare state” where it fails the test of reality.

            If you have a mercantile ruling class, as we have always had, then they see it as their prerogative to rape their working class as much as they can under law, and change the law to facilitate it. (very Jewish sensibility, it is the transnational point of view: right and wrong have no meaning outside of the tribe, only the law matters and have it changed as much as possible) [1] If the working class is getting raped, then they will support either a welfare state or communism. Our degenerate WASP ruling class, in a magnificent example of kicking the can down the road, gave them a welfare state. It didn’t save them from being dethroned.Pres. Putin and his Russian civilizationists have the right of it: power must reside in a ethnocentric national security state constrained by an ethnocentric republican legislature.  Merchants can never be allowed to rule, directly or indirectly.[1] Thomas Jefferson “Merchants have no country. The mere spot they stand on does not constitute so strong an attachment as that from which they draw their gains.”

        NATO is a geriatric brand like Metamucil or Dr. Scholl’s. The younger people have no idea about it. They just know they have no good jobs, rent is through-the-roof expensive and all the pretty girls are on OnlyFans. Oh, and don’t go downtown unless you want to be jacked up by some migrant or vagrant. So this whole charade will end with the Boomers. There’s just not enough money to pay for it all and domestic concerns will prevail.

        Maybe this is just the end stage of white guilt. People can throw around interesting essays and theories about why western Europe and the Anglosphere is destroying itself, but perhaps it’s simply white guilt, and a perverse reaction to what Joe Sobran captured so well in his great quote about “baffled good will”. When a people so thoroughly conquer the world, there is probably a bit of crying and boredom involved (like Alexander the Great) and then a wondering if we even deserve this good fortune, or put another way, whether we deserve to live apart in prosperity while others struggle. Whether a white man answers “we do” or “we don’t” reveals everything about his politics.

            There does seem to be a deep nihilism, close to a mindless death cult, that has gripped our country. I’ve thought that it might be a reaction to a loss of religion, and a deep self hatred that took its place.

                There are a large minority of self-hating whites for sure, but I think widespread and vague collective guilt (exaggerated by the usual suspects) paired with the white (Christian) tendency toward charity and justice has made whites unusually susceptible to cultural suicide.

                Most whites don’t think that race exists, sort of. I’ve heaa as rd this from their mouths, conservatives. They think western civilization can exist in any human.  A woman I know conservative brand of Protestant, is running a “Christian” classical school. I actually got her to admit the white race does not have a moral right to survive. She thinks the white race will be annihilated through miscegenation and that’s fine cause there are no races.

                It’s innate to European peoples, and when they flourish, it gets meta real fast. Basically, whites think too much. We have some molecule that allows us to think laterally and ignore contradiction. It causes supreme advancement but terrible, civilization-destroying mistakes as well.

                    Nonsense. There’s nothing innate about it. It is learned behavior specifically arising in Western Europe from the political results of Europe’s internecine bloodbath of 1914-1945. It has nothing to do with genetics or war dead, and everything to do with Western Europe’s neuroses.

                        Sense. Compare European civ’s writings starting from 2500 BC. They are autistic compared to the next-best, which is China’s. Look at Roman law…did the Sumerians or Persians or Chinese have anything like it? Nope. Then we took The Way and turned it into a fabulously overwrought thing called Christianity which ended up creating awesome structures, geopolitical frameworks, and even whole new languages. Did Islam do this? Nope. Then all the documents and writings that have been preserved and handed down for 2500 years because whites love to think and be challenged. Have the Chinese preserved their ancient shit? Indians just preserved some trippy crap and their lewd sexual practices. Can’t even find anything about Mohenjo-Daro.Then comes the Renaissance and Enlightenment. Europeans in overdrive. Every wacky idea and curiosity is entertained. Kings beholden to landed gentry. Women in charge of things. Making Aztecs Christian. Putting markets above rulers. Egalitarianism. Slavery is bad. Before long we were giving women the right to vote and the right of the Irish to rule themselves. Then whites figure they’re smarter than God and now we worship something called Democracy and diversity and could start a nuclear war because some whites looked at a piece of metal 100 years ago and thought, “I’ll bet there’s microscopic things in here that we can’t see.”

                            Nah, because nations that did not participate in the wars and had zero or near zero dead men also went Clown World, and others that were totally decimated of men did not. Sweden was neutral in both world wars, had no men killed, yet is busily killing itself, as is Ireland, which was not subject to conscription in WWI and lost no men in WWII, while the Russians and various Slavs had tens of millions of men die, but Russia surely has not lost its mind even after “losing” the cold war. Germany is utterly gelded, but Hungary is not. Same with respect to Japan and China-both nations suffered huge losses, yet only Japan is facing extinction and a crisis of masculinity. The difference is simply this, those nations occupied by and under the hegemony of the United States, another nation that was barely scratched by both world wars demographically, became self loathing cultural suicides.

Lincoln was a Railroad lawyer, backed by those same interests, and their investment in railroads and large-scale industry made it possible and necessary.
The same as Ukraine.The same as the “natural asset tokenization” that comes after the “digital dollar” being prepared.

                    Oddly enough, it did not seem to widely take hold until after the events of 1945. A certain White group was demonized for alleged atrocities against a “white” group and all Whites have been fed a steady diet of guilt ever since.
I don’t recall Vikings or Crusaders being particularly guilt stricken.

                Is it true that Alexander went native to some extent, became Eastern and feminized, wore makeup and such?
Maybe my memory fails me at the moment, but I want to say the future Europeans saw Asia as feminine and decadent.

        99 luftballons comes to mind. During the eighties, it was easy to be a German who was just a frickin’ leaf on a river going wherever the tides took them. The Americans and the Soviets were in charge and the Germans were a passive operation. In the late eighties, we got SNL and ‘sprockets’. Here we are now. Last week, I had done some reflection on what a trillion means. I think about numbers. UK, France, Germany, love them or not, there are still over 50 million people in each of those countries. 50 million limeys rolling over and showing their bellies is not gonna happen. The world is ripe for conflict.

                In every single town where the where “grooming gangs” operate—you can’t say “rape gangs” or Twitter will mark and suppress you, so now there’s no such thing as rape anymore—the police protect their criminal colleagues and arrest white parents and sometimes even the child victims, for not being part of the gang.Crime—offenders, police, and politicians—finallycame outas an alliance, a unified front against the people. It’s always been that, but a pretense was dropped. Because the systematic sexual abuse of native children by foreign invaders is simply too important to mess around with, publicity be damned! [Anthem plays.]That’s notnothing.

                I think it was easy. Germans at the end of the 20th century were a punchline. From the Simpsons (Hellfish) to rewriting Tom Clancy movies. I’m not Nostradamus, I’m not in the habit of predicting. I have witnessed two idiots in an old Caprice paralyze DC and I saw two other blockheads scare the crap out of the greater Boston metro area with a bomb inside of a pressure cooker. There will be ‘cells’ in Europe. Since the continent is on edge, it’ll take a small push. A lot of us discuss ‘normie’ Americans. What of the normie Europeans?

The senile old coot currently in office is reckless and feckless.“The fact that it was highly unlikely that the Soviets would move into Europe was never considered”Absolutely. The Soviets wanted a buffer zone. Operation Barbarossa was traumatic for the Soviets. Never again. Controlling Eastern Europe as a buffer zone was a prophylactic and defensive action. Just as the operation in Ukraine now is. But the West wants to portray a revanchist Russia.Biden, Scholz, Macron, Starmer, and Stoltenberg are creatures of this era and reflect its zeitgeist.

            The only time Russians invade Western Europe is when they go there to finish off their enemies who invaded them first like in 1812 or 1945. Other than that, Russian expansionism has always been directed East, as in 1904, or South, as in 1876 or 1914.

                The Warsaw Pact was created several years after, and in reaction to, the creation of NATO in 1949-50.
I think the Pact was 1954, the East German Iron Curtain was started in 1961. In 1954, the Orient had seen us nuke Japan and attack North Korea, with the French getting pushback in IndoChina, the Dutch in Indonesia, the British in India. The West is seen as colonialists, that is, imperialists. The Communist sales pitch was liberation from the Western imperialist pig-dog capitalists.

After the Washington Examiner reported on it they dropped it after a few months.  The writer thought it sounded like the theme from F-Troop.

                    I wonder what goes through Biden’s mind during a freeze episode. Does he realize he can’t move? Black out? Or not even notice—just a blip?There is a phenomenon of “sleep paralysis”—basically where one “wakes” up, but cannot move. One can see (move eyes) and hear, but is completely paralyzed. It’s happened to me twice in my life and was the most horrifying experience imaginable. It most likely lasted a few seconds, but seemed like a lifetime. The terror is indescribable, so much so I even discussed it with my doctor during end of life instructions. Being “locked in” is not for me—but could be for someone like Biden?

        Two big problems. First, Uncle Sam is stretched too thin. He can’t be everywhere.
Second, the “I” word again, immigration. Back when NATO was first fashioned, this is predominantly a European country. Maybe it still is, but with so many others in this country who have no connection to Europe, it’s a hard sell that they should put their lives on the line to protect alien peoples.
More unintended consequences from dumping the third world into this country.

                It’s all about grubbing about in the money trough. Regional geography, sadly, is now totally irrelevant in college sports. And with it, the vast majority of traditional rivalries have been destroyed. When tradition butts up against greed, greed wins every time. But, hey, the free market…

Funny thing, NATO has the UK in it, so he has them as an ally. That should be real popular at home, they still want the Malvinas back. He’ll end up getting them in a war that they will lose fast.

            The managerial State and Climate Change were made for each other.  The essence of CC is to blame a harmless man made gas produced by just about everything man does to make his life bearable.  This of course needs “management”, regulation, and rationing.

                        Never,of course. There is emerging evidence that our climate is directly effected by solar system and galactic level energy forces causing patterns and events we are just beginning to recognize.

        I don’t know if this anecdote matters, but I live in a place where most people are well armed and reticent about their personal affairs. And it’s a generally rural setting far from the big cities. Very unlikely to see much of the initial wave of chaos should things fall apart quickly. There is no “group” plan for what to do if things go hot. I think people will just follow their instincts. Our host now lives in rural West Virginia, so I imagine he has a sense of what would happen if the revenuers showed up in the hollers of Appalachia. The Israeli military is now learning this lesson in Gaza.

        Europe has become an idea, kind of like America. But unlike America, it doesn’t have the magic words on the holy paper to define it. The European idea is more like porn, not defined but known when seen. Politically, there was no such thing as Europe prior to the wars of the 20th century; it was purely a geographical and perhaps racial distinction. Europe as a political entity was created by the GAE to serve GAE purposes, which it continues to do today.I’ve long held the view that the decline of the west began no later than 1914, but one could say that decline happened more rapidly in Europe (from that point) than it did in AINO, and would have long ago been more evident in Europe if not for the GAE propping it up and subsidizing it. So that now we’ve got a situation in which “Europe” is already spiritually dead, long dead, but physically still appearing to function, thanks largely to GAE life support measures.It jumped out at me that after his trip, Orban said the next two or three months will be more brutal than people expect. Between Ukraine and the political situation in AINO, I was already expecting fireworks.

Striking right at the heart of the matter.The “leaders” of three continents funding invasion to replace their own people have no business talking about militarily defending them.Someone give them the flavor aid before Biden goes from talking about wives to talking about their daughters. It would be appropriate for the New Rainbow Empire, though the monumental and catastrophic disgrace in our name and the memory of our ancestors is too great a crime to be tolerated.It isn’t funny anymore.

        I can’t help but wonder how much of EU behavior involves blackmail by the Chosen. Sure there is a lot of good idea boss, female style virtue signaling and general stupidity but if that special tribe was to give marching orders to the EU it would look much like it does now

        I can’t get over how the NATO SG reminded me of the actor who played Oppenheimer in the recent movie, and how appropriate that is considering they may get us all nuked.
And old perv power-moves Joe was pressed against him way too long. Weird.

            Ackshually, if you remember and bring up any of the names from the period, gen x music journalists arestillmad about the turn-of-the-century underground hiphop scene—”backpack rap”—because it was dominated by white literature nerds.
Rap being anything other than the dumbest garbage imaginable = media outrage. How strange!
(Conservatives are actually right about this, but…not quite.)
