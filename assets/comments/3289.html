        It is a fact that Bradshaw wasn’t accepted into LSU and ended up at La Tech. That was all the evidence than many needed to conclude that he wasn’t the sharpest tack in the factory.

        Steve Sailer has an interesting post on this issue. There have been very few black quarterbacks ranked above average in the NFL.

        Remember that to be a successful quarterback in the NFL, you have to have been a QB your entire life.  So, in youth football, the RG3’s and such were QBs, but they weren’t in a ‘pro style’ offense.  They ran the ball all the time.  Then, they get to college, and still play in a run-all-the-time offense.  Yeah, maybe they can throw a little (RG3 at Baylor, for example), but they aren’t taught a drop back approach the way the successful QBs like Brady, Manning, or Rivers were. They don’t know how to be a drop back passer, because it isn’t what they were taught.Intelligence?  Probably a factor, but to me, the main thing was the style of offense they ran as a kid.  Oh, and that is a function of their coaches – if the coach can’t teach it (like in most of the black youth programs), they won’t learn it.

        I think Warren Moon was a successful black QB with the old Houston Oilers. He predated McNabb by at least 20 years. Of course, your observation of the modern era “cult” thing is correct.
Bradshaw, as pointed out, loves to play the hick because he is a smart and clever hick that became one of the best to ever play QB. He, along with other Steelers, helped forge the modern ‘sacred’ image the NFL finds so useful in fleecing fans of their cash.

        Bradshaw may have enjoyed playing the hick all his life, but  there is no reason to think his IQ does not fit into the Caucasian average, 95-105. That may or may not be at the lower end of what is required to understand an NFL offense under great pressure but we can assume that 85 is not going to make it, which cuts out six of seven blacks from that pool. No doubt in my mind that black NFL players are aware of what’s what.  They are challenged and berated six days a week along with every one else to understand their assignments. They know why it is that the bolts holding together the QB come undone the quickest.
