        Check the comments section on nearly any article or news report in which Moslems have been behaving as Moslems are wont to do. The people are overwhelming Awake and Aware of the threat that the “Religion of Peace” represents. Only the political Elites and their sycophants deny reality. It’s already too late for Sweden. If France has enough men with balls left in its population, they can turn this around but it’ll have to get ugly. Germany has been showing signs the past month or so, through the PEGIDA rallies, that they are done tolerating the intolerable. Here in the US we still have time to muster the strength to deal with the problem but not as much as we think. And we probably can’t even start until Dear Leader and His Merry Band of Progressive/Communist/Islamists leaves the building.

        There are papers in the US which close down the comment section when the readers get the upper hand. Are the European papers really using the readers to say what they can’t? That would be good news of a sort.
