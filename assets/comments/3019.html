        Let the arguments about ala carte happen. While the cable companies bitch and moan and whine, Netflix et al will be steadily skimming off users. One day the cable companies will wake up and all they will have left are that 20% who want sports.My Roku gives me access to Huluplus, Netflix, Amazon Prime. The cable cord is being cut next month for me.

        a la carte cable would be great, assuming you include satellite providers in the word “cable” – I don’t even know how many channels I have on my Dish Network provider, just like most cable users, I only use about 10% of them, if that much. But a politician championing the idea? Way too sensible for most of them.

            I have DTV for sports. I dropped it last winter, but re-upped for football season. On a bet I could not find channels like CNN and MSNBC. There’s a channel on there called LOGO. It is for homosexuals. No kidding. How can it possible exist without subsidies?
If I could just buy the games I wanted, I’d do that in a heartbeat. I simply have no interest in the rest of it.

        Let free markets reign! In the FREE marketplace of ideas, there is not much of a desire for Leftist ideas. Example: talk radio. Conservatives dominate for a reason. Leftists cry and whine about some ridiculous “fairness doctrine” because they know that their ideas are out of step with the majority of Americans. I’m sure there must be one or two Lib radio shows that limp along. I’m betting their audience share is not in the same ballpark as any conservative’s radio show.Example: Fox News. Number one cable news for years now. Snarky, jealous Leftists enjoy referring to FN as Faux News. But they are still also enjoying their Kool-Aid, whilst watching Madcow and Melissa Pary-Hairy foam at the mouth.I’ve thought for years that ala carte Cable is the way to go. At least for the consumer. Getting the communication conglomerates to offer it, though, is another matter. Maybe some smarty pants will have the $ to start a new company that releases us from Cable Bondage.

            In most communities, cable is a monopoly. I really have no qualms about treating them like any other utility. Comcast is not exactly the same as your power company, but they are similar. Telling the cable operators they must offer unbundled service is not Marxism.
