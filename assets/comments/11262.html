        What the elites fear most is an intelligent, motivated, and armed underclass; because they will be extremely difficult to subjugate. Even a tyrannical government cannot implement overt firearm confiscation without tipping their hand, so the next best thing is to dilute the population with needy sheeple and gum up the works. The false-flag operations have now begun. Phase II is to instigate blue-on-green conflict and decimation. These guys are playing chess; we need to be thinking several moves ahead too.

        Obama is the Robert Mugabe of American presidents and is still working toward the Zimbabwean vision.  The police stand down and allow the lefties to attack the righties without consequence at the behest of liberal governors via liberal mayors.
Why flood the country with immigrants who will never assimilate and freely state their intention to kill us?  Our extinction is clearly part of the battle plan.

        The escalation of removal of Confederate statues and plaques after Charlottesville is stunning. Almost like our betters were just waiting for the right moment, or maybe the rally was a complete set up from the beginning.Serious and open discussion all over the mainstream media outlets of not just Confederate statues, but the Founding Fathers as well. open discussion is a tell that they are waiting for the next manufactured ‚Äúevent‚Äù by the right to rip everything down.Or maybe they won‚Äôt even wait for that.

            It feels like it is operating from a playbook, doesn‚Äôt it?They also seem to be calibrating their activities and messaging to zero in on Trump‚Äôs weak point, which is to take a logical, if controversial stand, and then encourage him to double down on it.  He could have ignored the press questioning a couple of days ago, but his nature would not allow it.  If he is operating by the seat of his pants, which it really looks like he is doing, he needs to be much quicker to recalibrate his messaging on the fly.  I am not sure he is up to it.

                At the height of the media hate storm that followed Charlottesville, Trump stood up for the Dirt People. I don‚Äôt think he needs to recalibrate his message, which basically was that Antifa and White Supremacists are both scum. I think people like Kessler need to rethink their tactics. And their imagery.

                    Given what has been just learned about Kessler‚Äôs recent background (i.e. before 11/16 he was evidently part of Occupy, a CNN stringer and an Obama supporter), the first question that needs to be answered is who he is actually working for.
If he is a not-so-deep cover provocateur, his tactics are perfect, as is is imagery.

                        This will sound strange, but obama voters and Occupy protesters joining the alt-right isn‚Äôt unheard of. Rare, but I know a couple people like that.  Today‚Äôs Leftism is very unpalatable to true liberals.
I don‚Äôt know anything about Kessler either way, just saying his conversion isn‚Äôt as screwy as it might seem.

                Once you have clearly and publicly made your point, and someone (the press, in this case) gets in your face to argue the point, respond with the Breitbart ‚Äúso?‚Äù, then move on.

                As long as Trump positions himself as ‚Äúdisciplined‚Äù in his thinking and not ‚Äúangry‚Äù and ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù, in the eyes of the vast middle swath of voters who don‚Äôt think rationally, but just go with their gut.  They will tolerate only so much drama, anger, and crazy.  The press and most of Washington are working 24/7 to paint him as a loon.  The CEOs are, in part, a good proxy for that middle voter, who are their employees and customers.  Trump needs to pick his fights and know when not to double down.  His supporters will forgive him that.  He has time and room to make things right (and I don‚Äôt mean backing off by one iota, but by dropping the argument for now, having made his point).  Let the left go crazy trying to bait him from here, it works against them when he doesn‚Äôt take the bait every time, right away.

        What you wrote describes the mentality of the university, too: ‚ÄúPart of what you see with the open borders people is their belief that their unique situation can scale up to the stars. The UN is a heavily guarded playpen for the rich brats of the world‚Äôs political elite. These brats look around and see a rainbow of colors getting along like old chums. They jump from there to assuming that this can be done everywhere, not realizing the global elite can only get along when there are men with guns keeping the peace. They live in a fortified compound and they want that for everyone.‚ÄùOne other thought about Europeans not being willing to fight for their countries. It was policy in the late Roman Empire to assign soldiers to frontiers where they had no national or family ties, and thus would be less inclined to rebellion spurred on by love of country or people. This in turn fed some of the apathy toward fighting against barbarians who crossed those frontiers, which then led to the emperors having to pay off the barbarians in hopes of keeping them out. Our current circumstance involves a similar psychology. The Roman soldier was an alien where he served, and this alienation inhibited his desire to act like a soldier would act in defending his own country. Unlimited immigration makes people aliens in their own countries. When ones culture reaches a critical point of deracination motivational ties are severed.This may be why we see mercenary armies almost exclusively in the developed world today. It‚Äôs a bad sign.

        By the way, VDare has been shut out by PayPal, as have a whole slew of lesser known sites. CounterCurrents is getting the same treatment.Major credit card companies are also jumping on the bandwagon and refusing to process payments from ‚Äúwhite nationalist‚Äù sites.The removal of monuments is going into overdrive.Charlottesville was definitely a set up, top to bottom.

        Looks like another murder by vehicle in Barcelona, at least 13 dead.I‚Äôm sure the national hissyfits will be in full force by the likes of Kimmel, Colbert and the usual suspects. We have to get to the bottom of this hatred and stop it now.

            Things won‚Äôt become very interesting until a few white males give up on their own kind and coordinate a world war on all premenopausal white females. Then little white SJ rats in high schools, colleges, HR departments, and elsewhere will learn the hard way how foolish they and their predecessors have been.

                I understand where you are coming from. I‚Äôd say that many if not most white females are basically race traitors. I married my wife because of her personal attributes, but thinking back on things I think something that may have been an unconscious motivation was the fact that despite the fact that she wasn‚Äôt American her values and cultural proclivities made her more white and Western than the girls I went to school with.

            The very rich, very white people see no threat from the seat-shitters.  They don‚Äôt have the resources, intelligence, or social organization to threaten them.  Their only threat is to multiply and ultimately overrun them.  But an armed, organized, and aware underclass (see TomA‚Äôs comment above) is a huge threat to them.  Perversely, the seat-shitters are a tool to be used against the underclass.
The left loves mankind, it‚Äôs people they can‚Äôt stand.  Supporting the seat-shitters allows them to intellectually cover both halves of that old chestnut.

        From Eric Hoffer‚Äôs True Believer:‚ÄúThe radical and the reactionary loath the present.‚Äù Thus, by regarding the modern world as vile and worthless, mass movements inspire a perpetual battle against the present. Now they are trying to erase the past which reminds them of what they are not or could ever be.
This doesn‚Äôt explain everything but a large part of what is going on is just hatred for their pathetic lives. The rich and influential, well your take on them is spot on.

            Excellent reference, David. I‚Äôll offer this quote from Chantal Delsol to continue the line of thought:Twentieth Century Totalitarianism ‚Äì Delsol‚ÄúTwentieth century totalitarianism treated those it ruled as a multitude of faceless individuals. They were not considered persons, but were denied their dignity and forbidden from developing true relationships with others. Admonitions against close family ties or close friendships were the essence of this particular form of dehumanization. Nor were individuals considered subjects. They were deprived of freedom of thought and the freedom to shape their own destinies.‚Äù‚ÄúWestern society in late modernity is reminiscent of holism in its effacement of the subject: the individual confirms the common conscience and avoids personal responsibility. It is reminiscent of totalitarianism in that it has in common the construction of collectives or masses and its weakening of the person-subject, who has trouble dealing with difference and participating in heterogeneous groups. Neither communitarian nor totalitarian, yet sharing common characteristics with both, the society of late-modern individuals is one of spontaneous gregariousness. It is merely a renewed form of the age-old phenomenon of involuntary servitude.‚ÄùChantal Delsol, ‚ÄúUnlearned Lessons of the Twentieth Century ‚Äì An essay on Late Modernity‚Äù, pp.135

        Busy today so not a lot of time for a considered comment, so here are my quick thoughts:The move from the Democrats to remove Confederate statues is clearly a political wedge move. Democrats have little white constituency South of the Mason-Dixon line, and it will play well with their core voters of blacks and Northern liberals. I suspect Hispanics and Asians could care less.Normies and moderates aren‚Äôt going to object to obliterating the history of the Confederacy. The best response to this is to agree and amplify (H/T Vox Popoli). Most of the Founding Fathers were slaveowners and white supremacists. They need to be erased from History. Washington &amp; Jefferson Monuments need to go. Lincoln did not own slaves but was a white supremacist. Lincoln Monument needs to go. Ditto Mt. Rushmore. If we‚Äôre going to impose a purity test on our history let‚Äôs do it right.The time is coming when Normies and moderates will have to pick sides. Let‚Äôs make it clear to them what‚Äôs at stake here.

        The Kalergi Plan‚Ä¶The Globalist/Communist/Marxists are doing exactly what they said they were going to do‚Ä¶. Richard Kalergi and the Kalergi Plan‚Ä¶He was the founding father of the Europena Union.. In 1923 Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi wrote his Kalergi Plan (Manifesto) to form a European Union and get rid of the white race through the Multiculturalism of Europe‚Ä¶ But Hitler understood perfectly what these Communist globalists (Jews) wanted to do and it wasn‚Äôt until 1925 that Hitler wrote his Mein Kampf as a means to preserve the white race from the agendas of the Jewish led Communist Globalists global planners,‚Ä¶,Kalergi described his dreams for a One World Government with its foundations in the European Union. He states that the peoples of Europe should interbreed with Asians and other ‚Ä¶ to the Ancient Egyptians, will replace the current diversity of peoples and ‚Ä¶ The belief that the peoples of Europe should be mixed with Africans and AsiansHe hoped that the European project would go on to become the blueprint for a society run entirely by the global elite over a completely powerless population. He wrote that he wished to see the end of national sovereignty and self-determination and he believed that nationalism, and indeed the very concept of nations, could be demolished through multi-culturalism. He wrote that a society that was racially and ethnically diverse was one which was easily controllable by the political elite. According to Kalegri, a diverse and multi-cultural people were easy to control as they had no common identity to rally behind in the event of a political crisis. In addition to that, a diverse population would be easy to conquer by the means of divide and rule. The newly arrived immigrants would be pitted against the native people with both sides believing that they were a persecuted minority languishing under a system of law that was rigged against their favour. Over the years, the European Union has gradually eroded aspects of national sovereignty for nation states, often making national law subordinate to that decided by unelected figures at the head of the international organization. There has also been a concerted attempt to chip away at nationalist sentiments and nation-orientated social projects by such policy decisions as freedom of movement and Angela Merkel‚Äôs open door policy towards Syrian refugees. While Kalergi‚Äôs text might seem to be a relic of a more authoritarian and intellectually warped era, it is notable that he is still celebrated and honored among key members of the European Union today. The Kalergi prize, otherwise known as the Charlemagne Prize, was created in his honor to be awarded to European figures who have helped to promote his plan. Among those awarded this prize in recent years are Angela Merkel, Herman Van Rompuy (the former Prime Minister of Belgium and first President of the European Council) and Pope Francis, Bill Clinton. The fact that Kalergis Plan is still apparently alive in the minds of many prominent Europeans has led to the suggestion that this is what lies at the obvious antipathy towards the president-elect Donald Trump by European leaders. Kalergi hoped that the United States would be the next region to fall under the One World Government.

        I live in Denmark and read some post from Sweden. A journalist, Jens Gaman who works at swedish radio did a post on FB a few days ago about the ending of Sweden and how it will hit the wall.He thought that the state would collapse and run out of money. People who worked in the privat sector had no idea how close to a collapse the public sector. People who works there have reached their limits. The swedish society would go into a state where people who can flee would do it and those who can would stay. The country would end in city zones with chaos and people would go to the country side. But, even there the anarchy would come. Politicians would say that they have been naive. The country would balkanise into a war zone. He quotes Hobbes in the end for‚ÄúHell is truth seen too late.‚Äù and says Hobbes was right. It is interesting that he can make the post because a year ago he would have been shame out. I see as a symptom of not being loyal to this utopia anymore. His post can be read here in swedish and a autotranslate to english is in the bottom;https://www.facebook.com/jens.ganman/posts/10154982063948251

            These pathetic nimrods can‚Äôt run fast enough to the comfort of the anti-racist narrative.  The  anti-racist meme has been broached by the President.  But I ask you what is the ‚Äòevil‚Äô of racism?  That some people  get their feelings hurt?  Is that what it all comes down too?

        The UN wants us to take in more immigrants. Perhaps the money we spend on the UN should be earmarked for these immigrants instead.

            The UN is a neo-colonial organisation kept alive by western funding. All conventions within the UN are non-binding and they are only ratified by western countries unilateral. Refugees in camps in the near area are not funded by that country but by the west though the UN. So, all refugees in the world is funded by the west.Humaniterian aid is also something that is only given by the west. The humanitarian idea is post-modern from of christianity in the west. It is our theocracy.  Many African ‚Äúcountries‚Äù are only on the map due to funding by western states. So, de-colonisation never happened. It just got another framework with ‚Äúindependence‚Äù. The west are on the moral level still imperies and we see imperial stretch is now inside the western countries do to importation of people that come form ‚Äúcountries‚Äù that is illegitimate according to the normative imperie of the west.

            Mugabe is a logical man. If he opens up prosecution for those who killed white farmers, he opens it up for his entire government.  Same reason the left can‚Äôt tolerate free speech.

        Feel free to educate me if you must üôÇ but didn‚Äôt the elites of the late 19th Century do exactly this with the Middle East (the remnants of the Ottoman Empire) and then have to go back in and impose arbitrary ‚Äúnational borders‚Äù on the warring tribes? I‚Äôve read that Iraq, for example, was essentially a shape drawn around three tribes that didn‚Äôt get along, who were then told that they were now part of the new nation and had to get along. :-/ So the powerful idiots would be re-enacting the same disaster, only on Europe and America.

            I think the mistake our side too often makes is to assume the other side is thinking this stuff through. They are not thinking at all. It is pure emotion. They are in a full blown purity spiral now. It how they went from controlling the narrative on Sunday to scaring the hell out of middle America by Wednesday. It‚Äôs the same with open borders. First immigration became a totem and then the race was one to see who could stake out the most extreme position.Regardless, the 21st century will make the 20th look like a time of peace and tranquility.

                The leftists and globalists are running into a problem, which is that the man in the street just won‚Äôt quite play along.  So their new strategy is to divide and conquer.  Force people to take sides, and turn those sides against each other.  Last weekend‚Äôs set-up job was masterful, and Trump fell into the trap.  DJT is now positioning himself on one side of the issue instead of being a disinterested and disgusted person caught in the middle.  Big mistake, whether or not he is actually correct in his statements.  The globalists got what they wanted out of last weekend, more than they ever could have expected.In 1789 France, was any ‚Äúside‚Äù the good guys?  The people in the middle were persecuted by all sides.The new marching orders for the left, and the globalists, is to politicize everything and force everyone to take a side.  It was always part of the plan, now it is front and center.  We need leadership to stand up against all of this (the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, borders, language, culture), and to do so in a way that earns the support of the person caught in the middle.  Trump has been that guy, but his vanity and his ‚Äúin your face‚Äù New York style is killing him on this.

                    Read Art. VII of the Constitution. The one clause there pretends to state, before ‚ÄúEstablishment‚Äù, the law about how to convert A7 and the other articles into law. The illicit presupposition could not be more obvious, and we should count its presence there as more evidence that modern republicanism is a great, rickety house constructed with frauds. Other frauds of our republicanism include superstition about a ‚ÄúCreator‚Äù and some egalitarian pabulum entangled with it in the Declaration of Independence.

                I know I sound like a broken record, but the implication that the ‚Äúother side‚Äù isn‚Äôt thinking this stuff through is not true at the top level. Admittedly, their foot soldiers don‚Äôt, but the (((elite))) doesn‚Äôt want or need them to. No, the upper echelons of the ‚Äúother side‚Äù have their strategy based on taking advantage of human nature and have it down to a mathematically based science. You don‚Äôt gain control of finance, government, education, media, and religion without a plan. Nothing that happens in politics happens by accident, as FDR pointed out. This does not assume omnipotence or omniscience by our enemies. It is no more impossible than harnessing electricity once was. This is why the (((elite))) have always groomed and rewarded the most talented scientists, engineers, and inventors. However, I think they see that they will be able to ‚Äúgrow‚Äù the humans they need via genetic engineering at this point. Then, they can truly do away with the White family.No, by having contempt for the masses and using logic and an understanding of human nature, while forcing the majority of the population to make decisions on emotion, you control the field. I have given up on expecting the average person to achieve enlightenment and then begin to base their actions on rational decisions that benefit themselves and the social organism they exist within. In any given situation, a minority will look at it and think, ‚ÄúIs that really true? Quo bono?‚Äù The majority will look around for someone to tell them what to think. This is why you have Republicrats and Demopublicans. This is why you have corporate religions. These are just groups with a prefab ideology built in. It allows a sense of certainty and security for those that have never been taught to trust their own thought processes. Maybe because they are genetically incapable of it, I don‚Äôt know. Regardless, the elite will be happy to provide all the pre-digested philosophies and religions for those that will not think for themselves. And they do!

                    Don‚Äôt read too much into them. The thing you fail to understand it wasn‚Äôt the current crop of elites who took  control things. It goes back to Carnegie, Rockefeller and Morgan who started controlling finance, heavy industry, mining, banking, news, controlling politicians and even education in this country. Over time it extended to our very culture itself.The current crop of elites just inherited the great machine that others built.  Most of them are mental and moral pipsqueaks compared to the founders. of this oligarchic system.  This is why they are making mistake after mistake. The system is ready to blow up and take them out and they don‚Äôt even notice.They aren‚Äôt even self-serving pragmatists because if they were they wouldn‚Äôt let the system go straight to hell.And if the economy doesn‚Äôt go, it will be the legions of Maoists they‚Äôve created that are plain ass crazies that have placed us at the precipice of a civil/class war.

                    Great post. The 1 thing I‚Äôd add is that Trump + alt-right is a black swan event.  Combined with the masses finally waking up to the MSMs complete lack of trustworthiness, they see dangerous possibilities of defeat.  They have control of the money, of the institutions‚Ä¶ but they are losing control of a large segment of the population. The most dangerous segment, at that.

                The reason the Civil War came to such an abrupt conclusion was the agreement that there would be no war crimes / treason trials for the Confederates.  Grant went to the mat for them.http://www.civilwarprofiles.com/grant-protects-lee-from-treason-trial/What we‚Äôre seeing with these statues is an attempt to convict the South of treason 150 years after the war ended.  And these lunatics on the Left are risking the kinds of reprisals and violence that Grant and others so skillfully avoided after Appomattox.Flash forward to the news today where I saw Hillary Clinton gave $800K to ‚Äúthe Resistance‚Äù.  I also recently saw in the NYT pictures of ‚Äúthe Resistance‚Äù members of Antifa carrying semiautomatic weapons at the so called counter protests.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/14/us/who-were-the-counterprotesters-in-charlottesville.html?mcubz=3That means Hillary Clinton is financing the arming of a terrorist/extremist group.  It is not going to take people long to put that shit together.People forget that in the 20‚Äôs and 30‚Äôs the biggest blood feuds were between the Marxists and the Fascists.  In fact, the term ‚Äúanti-fascist‚Äù (ie. Antifa) has always been closely associated with Communism and Marxism (Franco‚Äôs enemies in Spain, for example).Your average American has no idea what Antifa is, and that they‚Äôre every bit as bad as the fascists they purport to oppose.

There are a small number of people that get into the whole nazi aesthetic, but for the most part its just a defense against the Left.  Traditionally, the Left calls the other side a ‚Äòbad word‚Äô then the other side spends the whole time defending itself from that word while the Left makes points and accomplishes things. You‚Äôve seen this play out with Republicans of the past few decades.

                    Hokoda, you give today‚Äôs younger generation way too much credit for history knowledge.  Most don‚Äôt even know what the Civil War was about much less that there were no war crime consequences for the South.What I see is idiots replaying what they saw as children, tearing down a statue, ala Saddam Hussein, and the spitting and stomping on them without a clue as to the cultural significance of such actions to the Iraqi‚Äôs.  They are ‚Äúplaying‚Äù like they are ‚Äúvictors.‚Äù  But they are a bunch of pussies.

            After WWI, a new type of thinking emerged. Because that war came out of a small conflict in the Balkans, it was of the utmost importance to not make the same mistakes. As is par for the course, the world decided to make brand new mistakes instead! The thought process was that if you put warring factions in a country together, they would learn to get along, rather than invade each other. That‚Äôs where Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia came from.This thinking came from a good place, but didn‚Äôt work. The Brits tried it not just in Eastern Europe, but in the Middle East and later in India.

From bones we saw significant improvement in the health  of large swathes of the population of Europe once Rome was gone.I suspect after the violence is done and new tribe lands form out, mental and physical health will improve for future generationsNo more sterile cat ladies, no more SLJW‚Äôs , cell phone zombies or any of the other puerile ills that plague the countryLife will be harder on the material level but tribalism and tradition for all its flaws nourishes the human spirit and its needs very well.The trick though is going t be surviving the collapse and not being an anonymous skull on the skull pile

        I‚Äôm reading Robert Greene‚Äôs The 48 Laws of Power.
One of the 48 Chapters deals with revolutions.Those who commence them most rarely are those who bring them to completion, he says.
He also says‚Ä¶ that the unavoidable outcome is a return to the past ‚Äî of course with new symbols, new names, newly named institutions (that have the same functions and functioning of the apparently replaced ones)‚Ä¶
This is to say: it‚Äôs a possibility the pressure to end ethnocentrism will lead to a state of as high ethnocentrism as in the past, after a while.

            When the institutions of the center cannot hold, bad things happen.  The model for the left is the Russian Revolution, or possibly the rise of the German Fascists (but with, you know, ‚Äúbetter leaders‚Äù).
What they are likely to get is the French Revolution, which was followed by Napoleon.  Not a good game plan.

                France, at the time of the revolution, was the center of culture and Western life.  Well, Paris was, and the wealth and power of the upper class in Paris dominated the rest of a rural and agrarian country, in which the Rural French dirt people and the Parisian cloud people had almost nothing in common.  The revolution started as a move to improve mankind.  Law, culture, and all the institutions were to be ripped down and remade in the name of equality and in order to elevate Man over God, Nature, and History.  This movement gave us conscription, the beginnings of Communist thought, and the Metric System.  Decimalizing the traditional calendar failed.  It resulted in deadly purges and counter purges.  Lists were created of ‚Äúenemies of the state‚Äù, and these people were hunted down and executed.  People disinterested in taking sides were considered the enemy of all, and were slaughtered by all sides.Does any of this sound ominously analogous?

        Z Man;I don‚Äôt get why nobody is looking at the multi-ethnic empire gambit as the misty moonlight Cloud-dream plan.  Just like Europe before nation states became a thing during the French Revolution.  Likewise in the Moslem Lands until 1914.Not only were the pre-revolutionary elite able to live like kings, as during the Baroque Era, many of them *were* kings, just small ones who had a suzerain over them.  Hell, apparently most of the world was organized like that dating back beyond biblical times.  Certainly this is the basic polity earlier than the era of The Iliad and The Odyssey, which clearly reflect this structure.In this vision, the UN would then be the Vatican or The Grand Mosque, adjudicating questions of interpretation of the one true faith.  Instead of the right to rule being decided by scheming backed up by war (as in the bad old days), they‚Äôd have op-ed volleys in the NYT and WaPo backed up by a Twitter storm or a street demonstration or two‚Ä¶Could our elite really be so stupid_?  Why, yes, yes they could.  Is that not one of the true existential questions of our day_?

            Just as a hypothetical, I wonder would what would be the result if D.C., NYC, Chicago, LA, San Francisco, Boston, and maybe Philadelphia and Atlanta were vaporized by aliens. What would arise to fill the vacuum?

                    Pithy, but not terribly descriptive. I‚Äôm thinking more along the lines of would the U.S. break apart into  5-6 regional super-states? How many working people would become destitute overnight because the federal government is their actual employer though they work for private entities (healthcare comes to mind).  Or would local economies actually improve if the current national distribution model was eradicated by trade borders between the new regional entities?

                        the thing is the leftists in this country have to be expelled or eliminated, otherwise they eventually take over and do same to us.
once that is done, there is plenty of land and work for everyone; after  population drops by 30 ‚Äì 40 percent.  no need for partitioning.

                        Most people would. Government at every level is (according to the Heritage I think) 40% of so of the GDPThis is not caused by excess taxes or regulation or the usual Republican shibboleths though those contribute.Its actually automation and immigration.Functionally efficiency is growing government by eliminating private sector jobs, first in agriculture, than in manufacturing, now in well paid service. jobsThe logical medium term solution would be closed borders and repatriation but it won‚Äôt fix thingsTo do that wages  measured as percent GDP must roughly double  economies of scale be  limited and the work week loweredOn top of that large amounts of inequality cannot be tolerated , personal incomes and wealth also must be limitedAnd yeah I can hear the screams of Socialism , its not. Its actually Distributism since the private sector is to be cherished not destroyedContinuing on the path we are on is basically leading to Socialism basically the way Marx suggested , people don‚Äôt have work, they vote for a bigger stateThe state grows, efficiency grows cutting off consumers , the businesses vote for a bigger state and pretty soon. Boom SocialismIts not classic ‚Äúgovernment owns means of production‚Äù  or ‚Äústateless socialism‚Äù like AntiFa is on about but something like where there is no functional difference between corporation and government and say Google serves as the Bureau  of censorsIts still a Totalitarian State in the end if you can‚Äôt communicate freely. can‚Äôt get benefits if you aren‚Äôt subject to regular search and unless you do exactly as your boss say, believe what he wants, you starve

                The military is not going to ‚Äúnuke‚Äù any American cities.  First of all, military leadership is part of the elite ‚Ä¶ they have been carefully selected.

                    Nope, don‚Äôt think that would happen.  Our enemies learned a lot of lessons from the Vietnam War and that was the benefits to be had from getting public support.  Support for the ‚Äúunderdog‚Äù commies, the Left being against any war for whatever purpose and protesting; support from a liberal media that would call for defeat by withdrawal of troops and funding, and of course reparations for all the evils we have done.  No, a Leftist city is an ally to the commies.

        This is not a new strategy. If only the American education system actually had the goal of educating Americans. In a post-9/11 world, it‚Äôs inexcusable that a person can graduate from high school without knowing the definition of the word, ‚ÄúHijrah‚Äù.In the 620‚Äôs, Mohammed sent moderate Muslims away from Mecca. Their instructions were to find a new place to live and to be peaceful. They found such a place in the city if Yathrib. Slowly, Mohammed sent more Muslims, and then more Muslims. Once the Muslim presence his about 10%, they started demanding special treatment. As it hit 15%, they demanded Muslim laws begin to be enforced, blasphemy laws, for example. By the time the terrorism started, there were already too many Muslims inside the city to keep order.The tactic worked. The city of Yathrib still exists today, but under the name it‚Äôs held since the 630‚Äôs: Medina.The story of Yathrib will become the story of Malmo, Paris, London, and Minneapolis.

        The Kalergi Plan‚Ä¶The Globalist/Communist/Marxists are doing exactly what they said they were going to do‚Ä¶. Richard Kalergi and the Kalergi Plan‚Ä¶He was the founding father of the Europena Union.. In 1923 Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi wrote his Kalergi Plan (Manifesto) to form a European Union and get rid of the white race through the Multiculturalism of Europe‚Ä¶ But Hitler understood perfectly what these Communist globalists (Jews) wanted to do and it wasn‚Äôt until 1925 that Hitler wrote his Mein Kampf as a means to preserve the white race from the agendas of the Jewish led Communist Globalists global planners,‚Ä¶,Kalergi described his dreams for a One World Government with its foundations in the European Union. He states that the peoples of Europe should interbreed with Asians and other ‚Ä¶ to the Ancient Egyptians, will replace the current diversity of peoples and ‚Ä¶ The belief that the peoples of Europe should be mixed with Africans and AsiansHe hoped that the European project would go on to become the blueprint for a society run entirely by the global elite over a completely powerless population. He wrote that he wished to see the end of national sovereignty and self-determination and he believed that nationalism, and indeed the very concept of nations, could be demolished through multi-culturalism. He wrote that a society that was racially and ethnically diverse was one which was easily controllable by the political elite. According to Kalegri, a diverse and multi-cultural people were easy to control as they had no common identity to rally behind in the event of a political crisis. In addition to that, a diverse population would be easy to conquer by the means of divide and rule. The newly arrived immigrants would be pitted against the native people with both sides believing that they were a persecuted minority languishing under a system of law that was rigged against their favour. Over the years, the European Union has gradually eroded aspects of national sovereignty for nation states, often making national law subordinate to that decided by unelected figures at the head of the international organization. There has also been a concerted attempt to chip away at nationalist sentiments and nation-orientated social projects by such policy decisions as freedom of movement and Angela Merkel‚Äôs open door policy towards Syrian refugees. While Kalergi‚Äôs text might seem to be a relic of a more authoritarian and intellectually warped era, it is notable that he is still celebrated and honored among key members of the European Union today. The Kalergi prize, otherwise known as the Charlemagne Prize, was created in his honor to be awarded to European figures who have helped to promote his plan. Among those awarded this prize in recent years are Angela Merkel, Herman Van Rompuy (the former Prime Minister of Belgium and first President of the European Council) and Pope Francis, Bill Clinton. The fact that Kalergis Plan is still apparently alive in the minds of many prominent Europeans has led to the suggestion that this is what lies at the obvious antipathy towards the president-elect Donald Trump by European leaders. Kalergi hoped that the United States would be the next region to fall under the One World Government.

            I agree Trent Denton, white people are horrible and can‚Äôt be trusted.

Somehow we white folk will have to muddle along without the sterling cultural and intellectual contributions from our dusky brothers and sisters.‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†ÄOr if you‚Äôd prefer, Trent Denton, perhaps all the white people could leave, say, five southern states and carve out a separate black nation, which I‚Äôm sure would prosper beyond imagining once Whitey gets outta the way.‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†ÄAfter all, one billion starving Africans can‚Äôt be wrong.

You are still a threat to invade other lands and break the peace and prosperity.
We need to examine all solutions to facilitate an outcome where all can treated with due deference

                    LOL.You just admitted there IS white supremacy.  Otherwise the invasion you‚Äôre referring to ‚Äì would not be such a threat ‚Äì because it would be going the other way.The reason why there‚Äôs a race problem here in this country ‚Äì is because the problem was imported.  The problem didn‚Äôt get here by itself.  The problem being imported into Europe right now ‚Äì is also getting there with a LOT of help.  Absent that it would not be bringing itself there all on it‚Äôs own.The solution ‚Äì at least here in this country ‚Äì is to start running the boats and the planes ‚Äì back the other way.What Trent Denton is advocating for is a Kenyansian economics.  Grass huts for everybody.

            I agree we need to end white privilege and white supremacy, and the only way to end the tyranny is to separate whites from everyone else. Everyone else leaves the USA, and then builds a wall around it to keep our pasty evilness inside.
