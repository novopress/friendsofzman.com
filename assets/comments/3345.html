        […] I’m not interested enough to research it further. It’s just another reminder that you never put weirdos in charge and you’re best off keeping them out on the fringe where they can’t break anything […]

        The trouble is with the Leftoids is that they regard normal people as weird. As they live in a bubble designed by mental minnows, reinforced by dogma and populated with prancing ponies sporting clown noses, they look out and see people with reasonable expectations as acting odd.I know some lefties (by marriage, not choice) who made the journey to Margaret Thatcher’s funeral so they could turn their backs on the passing cortege. They were barely born when she was in power and their lunatic views have been stained by hypocrisy, but to me that was simply weird behaviour.As I said to one of the slightly more reasonable ones afterwards, I wouldn’t go anywhere near a socialist’s funeral because that would be just plain crazy. I’d just be glad they are gone and leave it at that.

        Here’s a hint, look for non sequitur hyphens in folks name/ self descriptions, and remember the words attributed to the Jedi Yoda.“There is no TRY. There is DO, or there is do NOT.”(para-too lazy to “look it up”)

        The British made over the middle-east back in the day with the understanding that recently invented  Arab-Muslim states could only be ruled by a minority. A majority cannot rule there because it will happily exterminate the minorities. Then George Bush and his merry band of neocons proved them right. Democracy! We added that poisonous brew to their sewer just as our own was circling the drain. Which makes perfect sense.I don’t see the One as Negro. He’s more a fit for the joke of my youth–what’s black and white and re(a)d all over? This is a method of operation Bill Ayers would approve of. The object has always been to destroy a self-sustaining society.  The black pawns contribute little to that effort but theatre.

        Of course. Any member of an “out” group who obtains power will tend to reward members of his group… which is ok when group identity is a tiebreaker. The problems start when it isn’t a tie, and isn’t even close. And therein lies the problem with what’s going on now: nature or nurture, for whatever reason there are not a lot of blacks who have the skills and the level of morality involved to govern in a democratic republic, so the choice becomes between a white guy who would be good at it, and a black guy who wouldn’t, and the black guy in power is choosing his own, who in turn are choosing their own, right down the line, so the whole “level” of government has slipped a notch or two. Add in the Democratic Party’s fascination with government as the be-all and end-all of *everything*, and we have a toxic brew that is driving *everything* down a notch or two.I understand it. I don’t like it, and I’m afraid that our country may not survive it.
