            Putzker is so horrid that his family sent him to school at the opposite side of the country — both secondary and undergrad. “Don’t come home.” (Atherton, California.)They kept him away from the family business except as a passive shareholder. I represented Marmon Group et al. Putzker had zero apprehension of business, just a total dunce regarding the real world.Putzker looks at flesh and blood people as a child would view chess pawns. He was a totally unrestrained hedonist at 1871. Phones were always collected at the entrance of “children’s hour,” which was the “tech” (cough) party scene.He truly has deluded himself that he will be installed as U.S. President. Putzker’s child-like mind is that of a lazy obese dictator. I’d poo poo the installation but given the Machine, Putzker’s billions and Biden’s political ascendancy, I genuinely believe there is a non-zero chance that Putzker could become President of the United States of North America.The possibility is nothing to laugh at.

        Never more true.   It is mostly the same everywhere except in a very few cases.   Our congress critters in Idaho hold all of the elite views.  They are all warmongers and if Israel nuked every Arab capitol they would say it was the fault of those Arabs and God’s will.   Their narrative on Ukraine is the old “Russian aggression”  tripe that almost everyone abandoned in the last three years.
They all abhor illegal immigration but never offer any solution to curb said immigration.   It is all tiresome and the reason I no longer bother to vote.

            It seems like Idahoans will support the politician who repeats the most Reagan cliches about freedom and cutting government waste. Like the Southerners, Idahoans never follow up on what their politicians actually do and punish them for transgressions.
You mentioned the best example of illegal immigration. Idaho politicians campaign against it but then when in office protect big agriculture by resisting the adoption of E-Verify.

                    A notable thing about the Reagan era was that even tho he won 49 states, the press and media still hated him and it is their caricatures of the man as stupid and evil which have FAR outlived the man himself.  The President really has very little power compared to the cathedral aka the cool kids.

        My present state has a weaselly-eyed Jew and a corrupt black “preacher” in the Senate, thanks to the purplish and growing Atlanta suburbs contaminated with unwelcome Yankee transplants and annoying foreigners who are busy turning our state into a version of the dystopian hell they left. Like locusts, they’ll flee again, maybe to Alabama or Mississippi, to start the process all over again when Georgia is a failed state like California or New York.I like our host’s idea that you vote in your state of birth and can’t vote in your new state for 10 years or perhaps longer.As for the GOP, they’re the fink party. I ceased voting because what difference does it make? The GOP House members and senators will come home every two or six years, bleat some talking points about “controlling the border” and “getting tough on crime” and then they go back to D.C. and go back to being cogs in the great Borg collective in Sodom and Gomorrah on the Potomac.As RamzPaul says, Tom Cotton is not the senator for Arkansas, a deep red state. He’s the senator for Israel because that’s who signs the back of the checks to his campaign fund and various bribes.The one thing I will say about the South is it might be the future for state legislatures. Here, the white party is the GOP and the non-white party of envy and hedonism is the Democrats. Hardly any whites are shit libs are here, except in bigger cities like Atlanta and Nashville and college towns like Asheville, Chapel Hill and Athens. The blacks vote in a bloc for the Democrats thanks to bribes paid to the black preachers, who can sink a Democrat if the rings aren’t kissed.A reckoning is coming. We can’t spend like drunken sailors on liberty in a foreign port any longer. We can’t afford to be the world’s greatest instigator of war with a trillion-dollar defense outlay that even I, who works in the military-industrial complex, think is outrageous. Our population is becoming dumber and more non-white by the day. Civilization is a thin veneer, as Hurricane Katrina taught us.

            The tension between Republican-dominated legislatures and Democrat-dominated cities is very pronounced in the region, perhaps more so than anywhere else. Some of those legislatures are even exercising raw power (Tennessee, Arkansas), which makes them quite different from what we expect from the corrupt, cowardly Republicans.

            Husband and I made a point NOT toregister to vote or check out any local political organizations when we moved.  Meanwhile, the Illinois immigrants (mostly retirees) about an hour away have tried pushing a 55 million dollar bond for a high school (which none of their kids would attend) in an economically poor region with 1600 high school students.  How long the local voters will be able to outnumber and prevail over the invaders is questionable.

                    Even if you had won, there’s precedent in Texas for cities just going through with things anyway, as well as for Abbott telling them they have to.

        The same process was at work in the Raj. “Postcolonialists” are always pretending to be baffled as to how 100K Whites, max, managed to rule the entire Subcontinent (or maybe they’re not pretending; Post-Colonial Studies people are profoundly stupid; but that’s a question for another day).The point is, it worked the same way. The problem, for Our Thing, is that the Gandhi-type solution won’t work in AINO. George Orwell pointed it out in the 1930s — there’s no Nazi or Soviet Gandhi, because while even a large segment of the British ruling class was horrified by e.g. Amritsar, the Nazi and Soviet ruling classes would’ve called it “a decent start.” The Nazi or Soviet Gandhi would’ve disappeared into a basement somewhere in very short order. AINO’s ruling class seems quite willing to give us the Full Amritsar… and if they think the current security forces might balk at opening fire, well, we’ve got their replacements pouring in by the millions.

            300K whites ruling over 300m Indians, mostly by keeping the caste system in place and working through local rulers (the “brown sahibs”) The Gandhi solution was bollocks and never worked. It was a combination of factors that pushed the Brits out of India — the humiliating defeat in Southeast Asia at the hands of the Japanese, bankruptcy of the empire by the end of WW2, arm-twisting by Roosevelt and then Truman who wanted to dismantle the British empire, and in any case dominion status (which is all Gandhi was asking for, and which Canada and Australia had) had been promised to India towards the end of WW1. The people the Brits were afraid of was not the “half-naked beggar” (as Churchill described Gandhi) but the firebrand Subash Chandra Bose, who spent a year as the guest of Ribbentrop, was made an honorary SS brigadefuhrer by Himmler, met with the Fuhrer himself, and persuaded thousands of Indian POWs to fight for the Third Reich. Gandhi is promoted in the West because he supposedly shows the virtue and effectiveness of non-violent protest, which is a complete lie.

                    It must be noted, the Canadian trucker protest worked. We were headed into full bore covid tyranny when it happened, but that was when the  regime backed down. The organizers are still paying for it. Perhaps this is only the exception that proves the rule, I dunno, cause I’m not saying you are wrong.

                        No doubt the Canadian trucker protest, which we in the States were constantly told failed even though it was quite the opposite, along with a few uppity Southern governors, brought about the beginning of the end of the Covid Tyranny. I actually think there were even more ominous plans to build off of it and they were outright cancelled. Someone earlier suggested Project Ukraine was pushed to the fore and that was the reason it was ended, but I think that was only a part. The Covid Tyranny showed there remains a hard limit to how far the Regime can go even if so-called “rights” do not in fact exist.Still, the trucker protest was very much the exception. Unapproved protests remain an effective death sentence for the time being even if tyranny continues to have hard limits.

                Among the tens of thousands of Empire soldiers captured during the overrunning of Malaya and the fall of Singapore were those of the Indian Army, who were inexperienced, not well trained and angry at reports of senior officers trying to abandon the island. Their massive losses created a good deal of anger within India and fear among the Raj. There was a fair amount of that among the Indian POWs, and the Japanese tried to take advantage of that. There were probably many reasons that Indian soldiers were open to joining the Japanese effort, if only for the reason of avoiding the stigma of being a prisoner, or the likelihood of being treated as slave labor. Among the Muslim and Sikh troops. The chance for mostly apolitical Sikhs and Muslims to fight again was probably another factor. The Nazis were not very successful in “rallying” those who were captured in North Africa; BOSNIAN Muslims were more motivated than those of the British Indian Army. The Japanese were initially more successful, forming the so-called Indian National Army under former Capt. Mohan Singh. Singh fell out of favor with the Japanese when he realized that his forces were merely serving another colonizer, so he was replaced by Chandra Bose, said to have died in an air crash in 1945. The INA’s baptism of fire came when the Japanese attacked Assam in early 1944. Ill-equipped, still undertrained and unmotivated, their contribution to the offensive was negligible. When the British and Indian forces advanced into Burma in late 1944 and 1945, the remaining INA forces were usually quick to surrender. Nationalist passions, a mostly Hindu movement,  rose again after the war and public sentiment was against harsh penalties for INA prisoners. Even Singh got off with being cashiered from the Army; he later entered into politics. He died in 1989.

                I knew you’d be triggered by a sympathetic remark about the British.Ruling through proxies and being respectful of the local culture is called politics,Arshad.When the Mughal Empire does it it’s smart but when whites do it ,well, it doesn’t count.The British were not concerned by Bose who failed at every turn, and the Gandhi method literally worked .The British were planning on dumping India in the 1920s much to Churchill’s annoyance.Didn’t the British end up humiliating the Japanese in South East Asia? General Slim with Operation Vampire inflicted the largest land defeat of the Japanese in WW2.Keep seething ,Arshad.

                You seem to use Leftist framing for the British. You cannot acknowledge that they ruled India well. You cannot acknowledge that their reaction to Indian nationalism was moderate and that they could have been much more violent.Even Mr.Mustache said that the British should have been  more violent with Indian rebels. What does it say when you are more hostile to the British than the leader of Germany from 1933 to 1945? My understanding is that Bose was a failure and that his troops were considered by the Japanese to be close to useless.

        As a proud Confederate American, born in Atlanta which was burned by Lincoln’s terrorist army, I hate the hell out of the politicians we send to Washington. The upcoming Georgia Senate race is an example. Brian Kemp, one of “them”, has taken his name out of contention. One Left is Raffensperger, who as Secretary of State was a leader in the 2020 election scam. How he was re-elected is a mystery to me. Not really. MTG has withdrawn her name. It was thought that she is too much of a bomb thrower to be elected statewide. That’s probably true. Atlanta and all the larger cities in Georgia would be against her.

            As a former resident who lived outside the Perimeter, I can sympathize. The suburbs are now either infested with blacks or foreigners, especially Indians. Maybe I should put the blue-voting lunatics who fled their ruined states up north for “cheaper” Atlanta homes.
Glad I fled north a few years ago and live in a mountain valley with good land, great views and accessible water and neighbors who aren’t fond of outsiders.

        Strangely, I think the same applies to many Democrat states. Up here in CT, the Dems have a razor-thin majority in the State House and Senate. There’s no way we would be saddled with ultra-left douches like Murphy and (DaNang Dick) Blumenthal if there weren’t direct election of Senators. The same is likely true in Michigan and New Hampshire, just to pick a few, where they have Senators way to the left of the state-wide political center of gravity. Zman has described the folly of direct election of Senators on many occasions and it was perhaps the greatest mistake of the last century.

        How truly “conservative” is the South any more, though? Just got back from spending some time in North Carolina (with its Jewish Democrat governor) and it was more full of queers and hippies and nonwhites than my frozen little 100% white corner of Yankeedom.Now, granted, I was near Chapel Hill, which is not exactly Lumberton. Lumberton probably votes more conservative, but it is also a poor shithole where you don’t exactly want to move to.I would argue that the same pattern is repeating itself in Tennessee, Atlanta, parts of Arizona, Virginia, etc. The people with money and education and sophistication who are moving in are mostly not conservatives. Yes, there are still white NRA-type peckerwoods down there (who vote for black guys like Mark Robinson) but I do not see many of them in positions of influence.I would guess that the GOP politicians in the South are go-along-to-get-along types who are products of the 1980s-era Republican machines, but over time their influence is going to wane.Right now I think they’re playing a flim-flam game where they’re just trying to tell everyone what they want to hear to get donations but they’re totally insincere. McCain was the archetype of this kind of Red State politician.

            I’ve noted a big outmigration to North Carolina from “blue” states (specifically Illinois, as we have family who ditched Silly-nois and moved there). A big part of that is tech jobs around places like Charlotte and Raleigh Durham. How many of those people moving there are squishy headed liberals priced out of Ill-annoy and moving to less expensive digs? Which means of course they’ll turn NC Purple, then Blue if demographic changes continue. Because of course we’ll need this, and that, and the other thing and taxes will rise and liberals will take over local government.One worries the “Solid South” will be taken over demographically.

            The pleasant part of Chapel Hill is that it’s so near to North Carolina. It is an aberration, including in demographics.That said, it absolutely is an issue with people moving to the South and changing it. However, it’s still the South enough that it contains a fair amount of immunity.South Florida houses a lot northeast transplants. However, there are enough people from especially the governing elite that stumble enough Florida men/women to not want to live there. California Disney creatives were quite clear that Florida was a no go, despite plenty of Yankees flooding in.Also Yankees are not universally off the charts the liberal, and their native liberalism is not always of the California/Jew variety. They are much more likely to agree in theory and then live like a conservative.

                Southeast Florida and the rest of Florida are, both culturally and politically, two different states. You could also say that there are, culturally, 3 states of Florida. 2 or 3, either is true. A couple of things have transpired to turn Florida the reddest it has probably ever been. One, eliminating the voter fraud. Two, the recent transplants have turned out to be mostly rightward leaning, often fleeing bluer areas.To clarify on the 3 states of Florida. One, the southeast area, Miami, Fort Laud, West Palm. Two, everything west and north of there up to about The Villages. Three, everything else north of that. Or you could just combine the latter two into one and that wouldn’t be inaccurate.

            As you well know, college towns and megaslopolises, regardless of the state they’re in, are bastions of Leftism. North Carolina, alas, has Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham, Chapel Hill, Greensboro, Wilmington, Asheville and Winston-Salem. It’s a minor miracle that it hasn’t yet morphed completely into a southern Massachusetts.

                The banks weren’t the only frauds to get bailed out in 08. The private market for student loans dried up, so the federal government took them over and has been running it ever since. Obamacare wasn’t about getting everyone affordable health insurance. It was to force those refusing to play into the cashflow of the industry or pay a fine to .gov (at this point though, what is the difference?). And covid was most certainly not about preserving your health, but to bail themselves out again and see how much of the population believes their bullshit (and maybe kill off some useless old people that .gov over promised to, to buy themselves a bit more time).

            Lots of Jews moved to North Carolina over the past 20 years.  Lots of ‘yankee’ liberals moving to Tennessee and South Carolina.  They suddenly discovered that White southerners occupy some beautiful real estate and built livable and functional places.  So now they are taking over.  There’s an overabudance of Chicagoans and Californians in my patch of the Ozarks.  But rich or poor, the local repukes anywhere have accepted the left’s morality on race since the 1960s.  John Cornyn of Texas should have been lynched years ago.  The GOP in Ohio is pushing ramaswarthy as governor.  AINO has been colonized from one end to the other but people just refuse to see it.

            Here in the midwest we’re getting absolutely inundated with blue freaks from new york, its gone into overdrive since covid.Between them &amp; blackrock the only refuge going forward will be extremely rural areas where there is no access to starbucks or an RTA bus line.With the demographics being what they are they won’t be able to build any new infrastructure to densely black &amp; blue those areas.An old timer I know who still works part time for our state run electricity company told me the new diversity hires are illiterate &amp; don’t understand how to use a ruler. That’s who’s going to maintain our electrical grid going forward. No chance in hell they’ll be able to build sewers, roads &amp; everything else necessary to maintain section 8 project buildings &amp; bugmen amenities out in the boondocks.Speaking of, Trump can’t stop the states DIE programs which are still going strong. All those conservatives who think that ended with him are going to be in for a rude awakening in the days ahead. At least we’re going to have natural selection again but boy is it going to be a brutal correction.

            Dunno. When you hand a man his first real paycheck and he sees how much gets taken out, usually you can see the light come on in his eyes. Tax and spend mentality only really survives when one is getting free shit. Stop spending a penny of tax money on the colleges, and most of the college town problem @Ostei talks about disappears.

                Yeah. The only viable way to subjugate academia is to starve it of cash. Difficult to do, of course, but one sure way is to refrain from donating to your alma mater, cease attending its supporting events, and no longer buy its apparel and paraphernalia.

            A very large number of people, after the Ukraine war started and everyone was talking about nuclear war with Russia, posted pictures of major American cities with large red X’s on them as “suggested targets”.  Largest X of all?  DC.
I think everyone understands there’s only one way to solve this problem, but nobody has the will to see it through.

        Yes. Power is followed and kneeled to by the status seeker. The striver is our worst enemy. The striver is up on the hill pretending to be surveying the battlefield on our behalf while cutting off the supply lines, and doing advance scouting for the opposing army.It won’t be until things get so bad that the striver can be supplanted by those with some virile energy and principle. These strivers are everywhere; political office, corner offices, cubicles … … It is the freeze frame, lady-in-the-red-dress simulation scene in The Matrix.There are guys in Nashville leading shitlib protests against “Nazis” trying to ruin the nascent redoubts two hours away. I see as many naqibs and kurtis in the Nashville airport and as many supercilious strivers in fancy cafes as in the larger conquered metro hellscapes.The American Striver is quite a paradox; a low-life who will do anything and sell anything to get status. The best we can do is not be that guy and to start with a small group of cultured and ascendent men and find small openings to insert ourselves.

            As Alzaebo noted the other day, it’s a lot simpler to sell one’s acreage for big bucks to newcomers than to fight the encroaching suburbanization, developers, and big finance.  And many of the locals’ children want the money rather than the land, because they’ve been nurtured in the same government schools and on the same media diet as the kids in LA.  It was White people who sold the land bought by the Han.

                Jefferson wrote about the farmer reading books and educating himself. His children do better than him, etc. It’s the American Dream.

        I am a native of South Carolina whose lines go back to the Antebellum period and can verify what you say. I know my history, that from the archival data as well as family stories, and there is only so much a people will take. SC threw off Reconstruction rule only when the citizens held alternative elections, 1876. A newsman was there and left a book. It’s an amazing read. Until a strong leader arose, people felt hopeless. Graham, Scott are not of that caliber. Most of us remember Lindsey when he was a boy and he is a disappointment to us. But so was Thurmond, Hollings, and the rest of the political gang who emerged exchanging the will of the people for a lifetime career.

        Off topic, but I must make note of this:  The Episcopal Church has withdrawn from its refugee resettlement deal with the US government – Praise God.  Settling White South Africans was a ‘moral line’ it would not cross.  There you have it, folks.  Whites are not humans worthy of being offeredrefuge and comfort from these ‘Christians.’https://religionnews.com/2025/05/12/episcopal-church-ends-refugee-resettlement-citing-moral-opposition-to-resettling-white-afrikaners/

            Episcopalians abandoned reason decades ago.  I saw this same report today, and I just laughed and wondered why anybody in the Trump Administration thought it was a good idea to ask the Episcopal Church for help.  They should have just terminated the grant and walked away and never asked the question.  Fortunately, it appears the EC has done it for them.

                We happily attended a conservative and mostly traditional Episcopal church for about 15 years in Texas.  But it eventually fell to leftism and we left that church.  Today the Episcopal Church is anathema to anyone but woke leftists.

                    You probably know about this already, but an interesting Texas Episcopal story is the tale of Bishop Jack Iker and the Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth (which, despite its name, is actually no longer part of The Episcopal Church).  Some Episcopalians kept the faith, but they couldn’t stay with the national church.

        This isn’t just an issue with the South. You see this elsewhere in pockets where Republicans have an overwhelming majority. Essentially it is this:Areas of Democrat one party rule: voters consistently elect the most leftists of candidatesAreas of Republican one party rule: voters often elect moderate or even leftwing candidatesThe reason for this is actually quite simple: conservatives are honest and leftists are not. In places like California where Republicans have no hope of winning, conservatives still run as Republicans (and then lose.) While in overwhelmingly Republican places like the Deep South, Texas, or Utah, leftists outright lie about being conservative and run as Republicans because they know that is the only way into power.It has nothing to do with cultural heritage and everything to do with the fact that commies are evil, dysgenic, and dangerous creatures.

        For half a century after the CRA, the primary activity of southerners, in their relations with people from the rest of the country, was demonstrating that they weren’t their evil raycist forebearers. The dumber and more corrupt ones, who for some reason care about currying favor with demented, perverted baizuo, are still at it, and the smarter ones are beginning (alas only beginning) to see the fat lot of good it did them. The lesson to be learned is never apologize for who you are and where you come from. As it earns you no favor, only scorn. But even before they were co-opted by Sodom on the Potomac, the south’s elected reps were products of this mindset. Which we are only now at the cusp of shaking off. One can hope. If we aren’t swamped by the GR first.That makes it sound like I’m hopeful we can vote our way out, and if the regime didn’t have its finger so heavily on the elections I might be. But we saw in Moore vs Jones how it works when an unapproved candidate makes it to the general election. Or how every time someone tries to primary Graham, the regime puts half a dozen ringers in the primary to dilute the vote. The brazenness of their election rigging will rise to meet the need, but most of the time it won’t have to, as the people on the ballot will usually be pre-approved. As for the ones who still vote for Graham regardless, well, there’s a reason we so regularly complain about Civnat G. Normiecon. He’s alive and well in the south.

It took a long time to get there, maybe too long. Have you noticed that there is nowhere near the hesitation of the past to voice openly disgust with Yankees? I think that was required before the shaking off could start.

            Speaking of Ohio. I seem to remember learning that a big reason for enacting the 17th Amendment (direct election of US Senators instead of the original Constitutional way by each state’s legislatures) was because there was outsized corporate influence aka money from corporations like The Standard Oil Co.,founded in Cleveland, that had their owned politicians in the legislature carrying their water to elect a sympathetic US Senator. Showering money on specific state legislators, who were at least elected in their state’s districts, closer to the people, is a little more complicated than dumping cash from outside interests onto a single candidate, regardless of which state the dude supposedly represents..

        In the 2000s it was often referred to as the cocktail party circuit. Ed Martin was spit on by some random shitlib, which was a show that he was singled out by the DC crowd. It doesn’t matter what he was going to do or not do (and I highly doubt he would do anything, see how Kash Patel has turned into the consumnate FBI man within weeks of confirmation), he was the Enemy and Tillis had to act that way if he wanted to stay welcome in the DC social circuit. I really think it is that simple.The DC social scene hated Clinton when he got there but he fixed the problem by bringing in his own cadre of freaks and ghouls. Dubya did that to a limited extent (I remember reading articles bemoaning the “Texas” culture that swooped into DC) but Trump absolutely has not and will not. Which is a point in his favor, but it also makes it more difficult for him to curry favor from the locals.

                This is correct. By early March you started seeing all these assets get activated. The job of these Democrat politicians is to defend the crazies and create an environment where they can do what they do. Even if Ocasio-Cortez is not actually as nuts or degenerate as the mean Portland antifa protestor, her job is to let them operate and defend them. FFS the VP of the USA worked on a fund to bail out BLM rioters (and these bailout funds were backdoor payments, they’d give the rioter the money, they would get bail, skip the court case, keep the money, and the case would get dropped).

Graham might be a loyal house nogger but is he really popular in these cultural centres? I doubt it. He could never pass for one of them — his accent, his cultural background, his lack of polish, his general dimwittedness.

        Having moved to the South as a Catholic Yankee, there’s another reason for that fink, too.Modern Southern Protestantism and therefore it’s culture is held together by the thinnest of social glue. What keeps groups together is in essence a bunch of polite lies that everyone believes or pretends to. Agreeing that the Bible is God’s Word that we all get to interpret for ourselves* and we’re the best is no agreement at all.It’s hardly surprising that Southern elites go to Washington and absorb every bit of the culture. The social pressure to conform at any expense, because there will be no group, is paradoxically intense. Thus the people who love freedom are bound in the chains of the group. When they find themselves in a new group, they know what to do, and it won’t be conscious objection.Elite Catholics who go to Washington DC have different problems for the record. Catholicism is not a panacea when it comes to backbone. It’s just an outsider’s view of what appears to be a pretty fragile culture.*Also that all Catholics are going to Hell if they are fundamentalists.

                After I retired from the Telephone Company, I contracted for a while in Kansas City. There was a Black woman across the aisle from me, and me being from the South, we had many conversations. Turned out that she was Catholic and said there were many Black Catholics. Maybe it was a mid-western thing, but I thought that Blacks were Baptist or AME, or an ad hoc assemblage formed around some charismatic con man. Well, Whites do that too.

                Catholics and Baptists were pretty focused on black slaves. There are small pockets, particularly around Baltimore/Maryland of Catholic blacks. I live near a traditionally black parish.That said, also traditionally, each ethnic group had it’s own parishes, with it’s own unique Catholic culture. Anyone can show up to any Mass in theory. In practice, individual parishes have their own culture.

                The decay of Protestantism and it’s social consequences are very much wrapped up in the state of modern America, North and South.I’m observing a point of Protestant culture. I believe that most Protestants would agree if I rephrased “polite lies” to “dogmas”, but it does appear that most groups do seem to be oddly open about either outright confusion or needing to tolerate a level of dishonesty on certain topics. I’ve been in and around Protestant groups/churches enough to get a sense of the social workings. I also mentioned that Catholic is not a magic wand on the subject of fink. In many ways fink might be more pardonable in the Protestant than the Catholic.

                    IME, many Catholics have a tough time seeing Protestants other than through the lens of Catholicism. Thinking one could replace “pleasant lies” with “dogma” and it would be met with thunderous applause, for example, when, in reality, most Protestants (Lutherans and Anglicans aside) don’t think in terms of dogma at all.
With most Protestants, unless you can cite chapter and verse, you are not getting anywhere. That your pope invented some doctrine carries no more weight with them than if Jim-Bob invented some doctrine.

                        To be crass, Catholics and Protestants have very different understandings of “Papal Bull.” If support for some theological point requires 20 pages of legalese, and not a single Bible verse, we think you are just making it up.

                            An educated Catholic understands that Catholic teaching is complex because that’s like life. There’s nothing to discuss with a preference for 2-3 sentences, quite often taken out of their context. Yes, if someone wants simple, it can’t be supplied by the Catholic faith. The Catholic faith does however answer questions that most Protestant groups can’t agree on or even cover at times.

                                See, from this I can see you have no experience with a protestant Bible study. It’s never just the 2-3 sentences. Someone will bring up a different set of verses, and the search is on to make both statements true. Repeat. Then there’s possible lived experiences and real science that also has to part of the Truth.
It’s the difference between a real education and what it has become. In a real education, you can explain why you think what you think, instead of just writing down whatever the teacher said.

                        “E, many Catholics have a tough time seeing Protestants other than through the lens of Catholicism”﻿In my experience this is largely about Protestantism. Protestants can only see a group definitely or probably going to Hell because they are idiots or actively idol worshippers. If they understood the complexity or the history, they might think again. I can imagine their view, but they can’t imagine mine.“With most Protestants, unless you can cite chapter and verse, you are not getting anywhere. That your pope invented some doctrine carries no more weight with them than if Jim-Bob invented some doctrine.”I CAN quote chapter and verse, including to where Jesus instituted the Peterine office/papacy. They don’t care.I can’t get their pastor out of their head, so there it sits.

                            I can understand that. Like the other way around, you rarely hear from those who are less… strident. So I get that it’s given you a jaundiced view of protestants in general. That’s the risk of overgeneralizing.
“I CAN quote chapter and verse, including to where Jesus instituted the Peterine office/papacy.”
Sort of. What you can’t do is quote chapter and verse for Bergoglio having been your Fearless Leader.

Yet they have many of them and are quite clear on them. Baptists avoid alcohol, etc, etc. Believing that everything is in the Bible is a dogma in and of itself. Believing you don’t have a dogma is also a dogma.

                            Right. Lutherans and Anglicans are much better described as Catholic Lite than protestant.
“Baptists avoid alcohol,”
That barely rises to the level of doctrine. It is frowned upon as a common stumbling block, not inherently sinful of and by itself.
SBC is intensely decentralized The dogma of the church is best summarized as:
What you need to be saved:
Nothing about confession or baptism or any of the other gazillion dogmas various sects have. Indeed, to baptists, baptism itself is just symbolic, a public affirmation that you have accepted Jesus as your Lord and Savior.

        I am a native Southerner and from the stock that settled the region and can confirm. A bit of a quibble is that this is a somewhat recent trend among politicians. Not so long ago they would stand firm on segregation and other issues like school prayer. Yes, they would go along to get along on other issues, particularly pork barrel spending, which they loved, but they did not dare go against the grain of the region’s core values.There is an odd dynamic with this, too. There is a sharp split emerging among Southern states where some produce only the fink types you mention–Texas and Georgia loom large–and a minority of others produce firebreathers unseen in many decades. In fact, those that produce the former had the firebreathers in the past and the ones who produce more based types now never did. Make of that what you will. It isn’t necessarily urban vs. rural, either, as Graham exemplifies, although that divide is otherwise quite prominent. I think–think–it has something to do with the Southern Baptist Church and the areas where it is dying are becoming more based and the areas where it remains strong are going in the other direction. The latter is the majority.

            The South was brought into the wider American economic zone starting in the 1990s. It probably coincided with Clinton’s arrival in the White House. The fact that BoA formed in 1998 in Charlotte after a Charlotte bank merged with a San Francisco bank is telling. If this happened in 1978 I can’t help but think they would have chosen SF instead. The massive migration, in the past decade, to Southern cities from Northern ones like NYC and Chicago includes both well-to-do Whites and working class blacks attracted to the lower COL and taxes, but that was not on the table until relatively recently because the opportunities weren’t there in the same way. And of course this massive migration is going to change both the South and the North (the fact that Northern cities are replacing them with illiterate migrants is certainly transformative).Nobody really cares about school prayer anymore. They care about making money. In that way they’re not so different from the rest of the USA. Scott Greer wrote an article in his Substack about this last week.

                I included school prayer along with segregation for that very reason. The migration is exacerbating the rural/urban dynamic, of course. There is truth that most Southern states are becoming “redder” because of the migration into the suburbs, but that highlights the distinction between Republican and conservative/right-of-center. The Northeastern Republicans relocating to a Charleston suburb probably are less conservative than the handful of native white Democrats still there. Additionally, Southern natives still remain overwhelmingly dominant and generally hate Yankees and their culture although that is not voiced openly. That disgust, which is returning quickly among the young, is more social than political to the degree those two can be separated.I read the Greer piece and found it somewhat lacking and almost a Chamber of Commerce advert, btw. He was extolling Nashville and that city is well on its way downward now. The point he made about money was true but he downplayed culture way too much to make it.

                    I can’t speak to the cultural south as I am not from there, but I found Greer’s arguments compelling. I don’t think younger southerners see themselves as distinct from the wider USA in a way previous generations did, and the cultural/political divide is similar everywhere. I think that people across the country are becoming disgusted with the literal and figurative filth the feds and the left has imposed upon us, and that was reflected in the county-by-county election results last year.Nashville has quickly become one of the country’s big “party cities” alongside Miami, Las Vegas, and New York. They did that because it is making them money and giving them cachet across the country – a lot of Yankees travel to Nashville to have fun, which was previously unheard of. This is the point. They had no problem shedding their “southern identity” if it meant integrating with the broader USA. The fact that this integration means that Nashville now has similar problems as other American cities is a downside that they are comfortable with.

                        Unless it has changed recently, Nashville is in one of the handful of Tennessee counties that has been losing population. I do agree that was not seen as a reason to resist becoming part of the Pos. Greer glossed over the deep dysfunction in the place, though.  And, yes, nationwide the young are revolting against the Pos but it really is pronounced among younger Southerners.

                            I live 30 miles south of Nashville and agree that the Nashville Metro (Davidson Co) is losing people. It’s tired and the schools suck. From what I can see they are moving here and a couple of counties to the east, near the airport. These are among the fastest growing counties in the country. We also have a very good state university nearby with all sorts of good innovative programs, like aeronautical engineering; recording industry, med.training operating jointly with a med school in Nashville, and one of the best veterans/military family support centers in the country.In the Kroger parking lot near me I just saw cars with California plates (Torrance LA car dealer bracket),Nevada, Illinois, Michigan. Nashville is due south of Chicago on I-65, also Central Time Zone; I-75 runs thru Knoxville then to Chattanooga before entering GA.Also, a biggie: There is no state income tax in Tennessee.

                                Some family lived there and moved to the mountains to the east. While I absolutely trust their accounts, others also have confirmed the place is an absolute trainwreck. The best-case scenario is something like Portland but with the state riding herd on it, which Oregon certainly doesn’t do to its biggest city. The more likely result will be Detroit South.

                    “The Northeastern Republicans relocating to a Charleston suburb probably are less conservative than the handful of native white Democrats still there. “Generally speaking, the boil off from the North to the South is moderate liberal to conservative. The super liberals can’t stand the thought of rubbing shoulders with Southerners. South does have a pretty long tradition of some pretty liberal elites, too, which should be considered. Woodrow Wilson, as I recall was a Southerner.“Southern natives still remain overwhelmingly dominant and generally hate Yankees and their culture although that is not voiced openly.”Bless your heart. It does come out, though,  when they least expect it.

        You have to be a boomer like me to remember when the South was represented by Republicans like Jesse Helms and Strom Thurmond. Helms was succeeded in 2003 by Libby Dole, Bob’s wife, who at least was from the state.The same year Lady G succeeded Thurmond. Wikipedia: “In 1942, at age 39, after the U.S. formally entered World War II, Judge Thurmond resigned from the bench to serve in the U.S. Army, rising to lieutenant colonel. In the Battle of Normandy, he landed in a glider attached to the 82nd Airborne Division.” It’s impossible to think of a greater drop in masculinity.

        Fight fire with fire. Time to start having a price to pay for finking on us. Perhaps a concerted effort to make everybody think this Tom Tillis guy is a pedo might be what makes the next fink think twice. Who is that woman who claimed Trump raped her in an Bergdorf Goodman fitting room? Time to scrounge up similar minded people who can claim people like Tillis diddled them when they were kids.Yeah, it’s dirty, but I have no respect for these people. Ruin these MF’ers who always, always, always, always stab us in the back. Whatever happened to repealing and replacing Obamacare? Yeah, sure. Jerks.Roger Stone are you up to it?

        A big part of the problem is also the combo of the exorbitant cost of running for a federal office (or even mayor) and the controlled media. Trump was able to win in 2016 in no small part to his being a celebrity, use of Twitter, experience playing the media and ability to self fund enough to get the ball rolling.That is a rare combo. The system guarantees 99 percent who win won’t have that combo. Then you have the bribes of groups like AIPAC to directly pay off the grifters who get elected combined with all the other perks to keep them in line and at the trough.

        Usually, when you talk about “conquerers” you have people who have grabbed power by force in mind. A variation, conquest by invitation, is underway in Britain. The conquerers – mostly second generation Asian immigrants who were invited as settlers – have their elite feet under the top table in many high offices of state. In the Home Office, they can be depended on to scupper any proposal that threatens to close the open border through which hundreds of Afro and Asian illegal immigrants are arriving every day.

        Much has been said and written, most of it silly and quite irrelevant, about Obama’s African genes, as if they make him “black,” when of course they don’t. His speech, manners, polish, intelligence, and so on — these are the things that count, not his crude demographic profile, which is no more than a curiosity. As Joe Biden once observed (so explosively!), he is “clean.” Yes, he may be literally “African-American,” as I suppose a man born in Cairo, Tunis, or Capetown would be, but why make a big deal of that?Has everyone forgotten the most basic things? In this country the government is supposed to be confined to the few powers and functions specified in its Constitution — such concrete things as coining (not printing) money and punishing counterfeiters.The hysterical democratic flattery with which the news media constantly assure hoi polloi that “you decide” (as if the individual vote could make any difference now) can only demoralize anyone who grasps what is really going on. Despite the plausibility of his surface, Obama is no more genuine than the others. He believes in the falsehoods as gullibly as anyone. Pitiful fact!joe s

                        I thought Obama was a child of a Jewess/elite African. The children IRL of “Look Whose Coming to Dinner” is why our future is supposed to be some light shade of brown.  In any event, Obama completely failed the natural born citizen test for President which we’ve totally ignored for decades. People were groping around for that concept when they were busy looking for flaws in birth certificate.But if anyone in power brought up natural born citizen, we’d have to think that ethnicity is not controlled by pieces of paper.

                    Kenya is a wide continent’s distance from the origins of American blacks. That’s why Obama couldn’t “pass” in Chicago politics, why he married down and becameaboutbeing black, and when it was time to sell him the national media spoke of him in no other terms, then as president he spoke and ruled “as a black man,” to the absurd length of claiming his genes could produce a Trayvon Martin. He simplyisn’tblack, not as we know it, not really. But he’s not anything else either.

        Born and raised in central IL farm country, have now lived in SC &gt; 40 yrs and I still don’t understand how Graham keeps getting elected.  Perhaps the divide between the more conservative upstate SC (where I am) and the moderate midlands / lefty low country.  Or, mama’s taught their children to just be nice and that little Lindsey is just so nice so’s we should all vote fer him.
What worries me is now that Tillis has out slimed Graham, he’s going to have to one up Tillis and do something even more extraordinarily slimy.

        I am not sure if this will be true going forward anymore. The dynamic is that the true power and riches lay in the social network of DC, the blob. Like Macron, Merz, and Starmer caught doing blow on camera, the jig is up. Because the merchant class, the Oligarchs, are in full on war with the DC social network that wants their money and power.Bernie Sanders is threatening Shari Redstone over the CBS proposed settlement with Trump ($20 billion) and is working with 60 Minutes to torpedo the Skydance / Paramount sale for Redstone’s cash-out. She is also not happy about 60 Minutes pro-Hamas interview with a released hostage. Musk is now being threatened with jail by Democrats. There is just no going back. There is an ever-expanding group of would be DC bureaucrats who want more money and power. Many of them diverse and vibrant like the leaders of the Ivy League pro Hamas rallies aimed directly at people like Bill Ackman. [He knows it, Oct 7 and the spontaneous Hamas anti-Sat People reaction on the Ivies was a direct threat by the mostly non-Muslim, wealthy foreign young women looking to make their power play against the Saturday people Hedge fund owners hence President Trump.]Bezos, Musk, Redstone, Ellison (the hidden target of Sander’s ire), Zuck etc. have no way forward but with MAGA. DOGE and the rest is the reaction of the Merchant Class to the ever expanding appetite of the bureaucratic class. In this there is an alliance with the Military Industrial Complex which wants manufacturing here at home and mass conscription. Counter-elites seeking to destroy the Blob which is a direct threat to both the Merchant Class and the MiC. Graham is not going to change his ways, but JD Vance did. Note that Pharma is Trump’s cross-hairs, both with RFK Jr. and the new prescription drug prices cutting into their profits.Meanwhile the Blob is turning hard left. Fetterman is being purged, AOC seems to be Party boss now, Michelle Obama is “transitioning” along with “getting therapy” (no really, she said it), for the next phase of her life quote. David Hogg is going hog wild purging incumbents, and Dems are all in for MS-13 and higher Prescription Drug Prices. Trump’s political mastery is baiting Dems into stuff that now not just alienates 80% of the population but counter-elites. Will a Judge over-rule his lower prescription prices? Betting says yes. I think power is shifting now, as the China threat, failure of the Luxury Boutique Military, and ever growing appetite of the blob has rich guys fearful and angry.Bernie Sanders is telling Shari Redstone and Larry Ellison what to do. That’s your MAGA revolution right there.

        Let me add, that Joe Biden is BACK! Baby. It is truly hilarious. In an obvious shakedown move, Dr. Jill is trotting out mumbling Joe in news outlet to news outlet and will continue to do so until the Bidens get PAID! They need at least $200 million each to go away, so donors will have to dig deep to make that happen.

        What happened to Scalise has long been forgotten, probably because some deranged leftist was the shooter. Wait until one of our guys gets fed up, snaps and goes off on some Republican we all despise, like Luigi did to the healthcare guy.I don’t think any normal person was cheering about what happened to Scalise, but plenty of normal people were chortling over what happened to the healthcare executive. I’m pretty sure that normal people laughing at them was pretty sobering.Same thing would happen if these Rinos started getting taken out.I’m not the one who’s going to do it, but I’ll be one of the ones laughing if it happens.

            We’re already at the point where heavy majorities, on both sides, approve of their political opposition being imprisoned. It’s not a big jump from there to approving of something worse being done to them. As long as somebody else does the dirty work.

        Shots fired.  Justified.Don’t overlook however this is the GOP almost nationwide, the reason is the ground and county level GOP state organizations are women and matrons and screen out the masculine, the man, the Alpha, the leader.  A man would be a threat to the money and bourgeoisie status of Mrs GOP.  Certainly their Beta Cuck provider husbands shan’t get in the way, nothing must disturb the sacred bourgeois McMansion.   Look the GOP is the party for where you live not the nation and certainly not the Empire.   The Party of National government and the Empire has always been the Democratic Party going back to Jefferson, Polk, then Wilson and FDR.The World Wars and the Cold War were Democratic.The GOP even under Lincoln was all about where Americans live and improving their lot by internal infrastructure, technical state level colleges, the Homestead Act, Tariffs. Lincoln was all about these Whig Economic issues, he got sucked into containment of slavery because the Democratic policy was to expand slavery and crush utterly any free white labor (to this day labor among some genteel Southerners is “nigger work”).  From being mildly anti slavery as the new Republican Party was free labor and free soil workers Lincoln fell backwards into Civil War.In our time Crime and a reasonable, calm LOCAL environment and sane schools and balanced budgets, low taxes are GOP issues.  The Empire has always been Democratic.  In fairness that’s how we got the Louisiana purchase and to the Pacific Ocean, as well as the 20th century victories.Trump could have NEVER risen in the GOP, a man and leader is a threat to any American wife’s nest, women must have stability- and are only capable of knowing what is around them or immediately in sight.   The GOP is local or at best state level competence, no Man can rise.  We can have MTG or Ann Coulter, we cannot have a real leader.Real Leader’s shake things up, the Tea might spill on the carpet.  Mustn’t happen.  Nor will it.

        ‘Booshie’? There’s a perfectly good standard English word the shines corrupted to make that one and none of them spell it like that anyway. Taking ‘bourgeois’ as a pejorative away from and turning it back onto the left is also something that should be done on principle.

        If the Confederacy had managed to win the Civil War, we would be living in a remarkably different world. It’s hard to imagine a fractured America taking it’s rightful place on the world stage. Likely, without the U.S. to intervene, Germany wins the Twentieth Century, and world power stays in Europe rather than migrating to North America as in our timeline. With slavery a going affair in the South in the 21st Century, who knows, there might even be a call to permit slaves in the North.
