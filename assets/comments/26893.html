        Just here to gloat.I voted for Donald Trump because I knew worse wasn’t better. Thanks to all the people who sat out the election or voted for Joe Biden because they were mad about some trivial BS. Great call. I supported secession because I knew this kind of situation in Ukraine would eventually happen — endless hysteria and mismanagement as the Empire collapsed, then disaster. Yep; disaster incoming thanks to Twitter &amp; Reddit. I committed to never voting republican again after their response to the 2020 George Floyd Riots and then Juneteeth. Now they want WWIII!All great calls on my part — incredible batting average.If I had gotten my way, none of this would be happening now; and the terrible things that may be in store would have been averted. But no, we had to “have babies” (but live in tyranny for decades), instead. We had to “get tuff” by watching Jordan Peterson videos and working out and going on a diet. We had to flee to the countryside and wait for the apocalypse. We had to grill and do nothing because other people would get some guns or something and fight “if x line is crossed” far away in a future that doesn’t inconvenience us in the present.Good calls. Thanks guys.In reality, all these things were excuses to do nothing. It didn’t have to be this way. Yet another reminder that the vast majority of the population, even on the “dissident right”, are worthless simpletons and cowards. I don’t endorse the things to come, but it’s hard for me to feel sorry for anyone in this country either because this was the obvious outcome easily visible to all of us who aren’t knuckle-dragging troglodytes. We told you and we were ignored because you thought you knew better. Nope.

        It needs to be said – Part 3, the slaughter begins.Plebs from Russia are now killing plebs from Ukraine and vice versa, in very large numbers; and neither of these combatants hate each other or want to play along. Yet here we are. And it’s coming to a theater near you very soon.This was all organized and implemented by the Cloud People for the sole purpose of “keeping them dancing so they don’t notice that we have been raping them blind for years now and especially don’t want them to turn on us as a form of accountability.”That is why the US State Department fomented this crisis by egging on the Zelensky government with talk of EU/NATO membership and rearming with nukes. And if that wasn’t enough motivation for Putin to attack, then toss in the fact that US DoD was operating unsafe bioweapon labs in Ukraine with the mission of developing customized pathogens targeted at their backyard.And now the US and Europe are flooding the zone with sophisticated conventional weapons (think Javelins and stingers) that are guaranteed to prolong the slaughter and ensure an escalation rather than quick resolution.And the MSM/internet meme campaign has the rest of the planet believing Putin is Hitler and unjustified in thinking that Ukraine is a real threat to their security (bioweapons, move along, nothing to see here!). And the hypocrisy of this is galactic (hello Iraq War).If you don’t want to be slaughtering your neighbors soon in another manufactured crisis/internecine war, you may want to consider focusing some attention on who is pulling the strings.

                Most of the victim plebs are unsuited to fight back against the Borg, but there are, still to this day, hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of alphas among us. They generally keep a low profile because its in the genes, but they represent a formidable threat if (or when) riled to action. Consequently, a primary purpose of manufactured war is to kill off as many alphas as possible on both sides.I don’t think we are going to defeat the Borg using a Braveheart campaign of massed masculinity charging forth into battle, but rather a highly focused use of precision. In this mode, even the meek can be an extraordinary factor when employed as a bolt from the blue. Nothing is more decisive than surprise.

                        “They lost.”
That is my point. Fighting the Borg head-on via a grassroots rebellion is a losing proposition. There is a better way, and it doesn’t involve surrender or acquiescing to tyranny. Nor is standing on the sidelines with your fingers crossed an acceptable reaction. The future belongs to those who will fight for it, and smart is much more effective than brave.

            I’m gonna hate it when the results of our leadership over the decadent decades hits home, and it is coming soon. Sadly, as an honest man, I cannot say that as whole, we can’t separated from the ‘leadership’ that brought us here. And when we get what we deserve for the horror we have inflicted upon many upon the globe, it will be horrendous, terrifying, and sad as all hell, but I can’t believe in my heart then when you back people into a corner you kind of get what you have coming.

            The Russians have made good on their threats to disrupt importation of weaponry from outside,  and influxes of foreign fighters or mercenaries for Ukraine by launching a major rocket attack on an entrepot for such weapons and fighters, as well as a major training center of long-standing near Lviv in western Ukraine. Looks as if the Kalibr missiles likely employed can really ruin your day. This report is from Reuters, a western news agency (from my experience with their reporting) to be in lockstep with US/NATO. I detect an atmosphere of shock underlying this post, something that tends to happen when shit gets real.https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-warns-desolation-if-russia-tries-take-kyiv-2022-03-13/This is what all rear echelons of NATO forces would look like if it came to a fight. Destruction of logistical supply chains in detail is now possible to those possessing such weapon systems, and would be a primary objective in their war-fighting strategy.Another link to a site run by a poster of Russian ethnicity resident for a long time in the US. Was a Soviet military man, and a current observer of military technology. Post covers several topics, ending with this missile attack, as well as a brief reflection on another hypersonic mussile system just coming online for the Russian aerospatial services. He did a post on this a day or so back with more details.http://smoothiex12.blogspot.com/2022/03/good-ol-truisms.html?m=1

                The Russians have been executing their plan with relentless effectiveness and have now encircled the main body of Ukrainian forces located in the eastern provinces. Nearly 60,000 of their best men and equipment are now isolated from resupply or an easy escape corridor. My guess is that they will be given an opportunity to surrender and disarm or be destroyed in detail. That will likely be the tipping point for Zelensky to reenter negotiations with a more accommodating attitude.With each passing day, Zelensky’s hand gets weaker and his options fewer. Putin will likely offer a deal that includes Ukrainian independence west of the Dnieper River in exchange for a no NATO/no nukes commitment and coming clean on the US funded bioweapons program. The latter is necessary in order to rehabilitate Russia’s world image and justify its actions. But this puts Zelensky in a tough spot. Not sure Potato Head will allow him to live long enough to cut that deal.

                If Martyanov’s comments about Zircon missiles being invulnerable to current Western air defenses are correct, that system is indeed a game changer.
There are also some interesting remarks in the comments about Russia just shooting captured Western mercs.

        The conclusion that Z articulated can be summed up as follows.
Compelling other countries to find/create/use an alternative to the dollar, thereby eliminating it as the reserve currency for the globe, will be the biggest unforced error in the history of unforced errors.
And to belabor Thomas Sowells’ observation, a bunch of Harvard men will be behind it.

        OT but a very good analysis of the Canadian truckers, what happened, mistakes made, how they organized on the fly and some lessons learned. This full-spectrum insurgency, from the court room to, probably eventually, the two-way range, will be very long. The Canadian trucker campaign was an important early stage confrontation and we must learn from it. The obstruction level on the ‘peaceful protest – obstruction – armed resistance’ scale is very important. Because peaceful protests will be ignored or suppressed or both.https://americanmind.org/salvo/for-whom-the-horns-honk/

        My advice is simple and applies to the individual. It’s time to put to rest any belief that your rulers really live according to principles. They make, break, reinterpret or simply ignore them at their convenience. Draconian punishments lie in wait when they wish to “make an example” of someone. That’s why a man who put his shoes up on Nancy Pelosi’s desk faces years, if not decades, in prison. A thousand other men who committed rape, robbery or murder in the Imperial City will serve less time. They did not present an in-your-face challenge to the plutocracy. Do whatever it takes to satisfy yourself that your government exists solely to advance its own power and agenda. You are at best a dupe to be manipulated, at worst a nuisance to be swept aside or killed.Think for yourself. Do what benefits you and those you love. Your new standard should not be “is it legal or moral?” It should be the colder calculation: “What will I gain? What will it cost? Can I get away with it?” Live by your own code. If you are in a position to dispense justice, be it small or great, perhaps it is time that you become a law unto yourself. The existing “Law” is certainly not going to uphold you. In fact, it is still powerful enough to punish you so keep that in mind as the potentially huge risk it is. But as the situation deteriorates, you have more to gain and less to lose by becoming your own law.In sum: I am not saying you can do anything you like and be free of the consequences. Of course not. If you’re caught, you risk penalties, dire ones perhaps. What I’m saying is that there is little to be gained, and much to be lost, by pretending to be a good citizen of a rules-based society that died long ago. It’s time to stop being your own jailer.You are a chump if you blindly and faithfully follow the rules. Nietzsche’s ideal of the Übermensch may not be exactly this, but it approaches the ideal of the hero who lives by his own code. Perhaps it’s time to stop being a sheep and instead become that “blond beast of prey.”

            Your new standard should not be amoral, as that will quickly begin to harm your cause as well as, more importantly, your soul.
You should ask, “What can I do that is moral and at the same time benefits me and mine?” As to strict legality, well, that’s certainly a different matter by now.

                Save your morality for you and yours.  For others, not so much.  This is basically the rules of the game as has been taught to us time and again, but we are slow learners it seems.  Don’t let your virtues be used against you.

            @Ben.  Well said.   Even if one doesn’t agree with you fully.“Perhaps it’s time to stop being a sheep and instead become that “blond beast of prey.”  Cool.  Never heard the “blond beast of prey” line.But yeah, we do live among sheep.  We’ve got to insinuate ourselves within them.   Caring about them, so as to change their minds.  We can’t do that from a cabin in the woods.  They are mostly innocently ignorant.  Give them the right story, images and myth, and they will turn.95% of these turnable white sheep Americans are those people in funny street interviews who just 4 weeks ago didn’t know what a ukraine was.  Prolly a kind of big bird.They think Ohio and Idaho are the same thing. Just pronounced differently.  I’m from the former.  So I’ve heard it my whole life.Girl: “So Frip, you like potatoes then, hah”   “No, I said Ohio. I like the Mud Hens.”  “Oh Ohio, where’s that?”  “You know, up by the Great Lakes.  Michigan, Toronto.”  “Sorry, I don’t know where those are either, hehee.”  “It’s ok.  It’s way up by the North Pole.  Over by New York.  You know, the Statue of Liberty and all that.”  “Oh OKAY. We took a school trip there once. Cool.”To be fair, whoever named the states of Idaho, Iowa, and Ohio were some real dullards.  Those are stupid names that sound more like a yawn than a state.  And they DO sound alike.  Not one of the founding hayseeds of Iowa stood up at the meeting and said, “Kinda sounds like Ohio don’t it?”(Yeah I know, probably Indian names.  Still. So we wipe out a people, then name our states after them?  Was that some kind of prank?)

                Name of the area was called after Indians while they were still occupying the land.  It was later that the Indians were moved out, but by that time, the land was named after the predominant (now gone) tribe.  Perhaps cities might be a better example.

        We are rapidly heading toward parallel institutions being formed – blocs of technology stacks. Russia, China, and perhaps a half-dozen other boogie men nations we have spats with.SWIFT is just the start.The US has had 30 years to get its foreign policy act together in moving from two superpowers to a multi-polar world. Our ruling class was not up to the tasks of both defining America’s role (as what euphemistically used to be termed as “the world’s policeman”) and carrying out that role … without being tempted by the pull of Empire.It’s not that the role was even ours to have, but we still had sufficient moral capital to lay claim to it at that time — provided we could carry through.No matter what happened in world affairs, ALL American politicians (no matter the stripe) understood that Job One of all American institutions was to protect the goose that lays the golden eggs – the reserve currency status. That goal was the single undergirding of the entire galaxy of international institutions that America built post WWII.We notice there is a slight disconnect here … the nation that wants to defund its own police still thinks it has divine right to policing the world. (Not to mention your every thought!) Kamala’s performances on the world stage this week are not just symbolic, they are the reality. Even our allies are starting to notice.

            Need further evidence that we do not live in a real  democracy?
Item. #947. Our leaders, the top 4.
1. A corrupt, stupid, demented old man
2. A affirmative action clown
3. A corrupt, stupid old lady, top House rodent
4. A corrupt, stupid old man, top Senate rodent
Would the ppl living in a real democracy choose such leaders?
We are manipulated, controlled by stupid, corrupt anti-American Americans and foreign globalists who want to replace western civilization and the ppl responsible for it with a mongrel population and a new global civilization.

We should be so lucky… not sure we are quite there yet which is why they are so egregious &amp; arrogant with their diktats to ‘bow &amp; submit’.
I would be MORE than happy to engage with the ‘parallel institutions’ but they are not even close yet unfortunately. Wishful thinking though and let’s hope this gets the ball rolling.

            I’d say we had and lost the opportunity to shift to a unipolar world that attempted to live up to the lofty rhetoric around America.
We couldn’t do that because it would take hard work, attention to detail, and a virtuous people.
Why bother putting in all that effort when you can just grift off the effort to sell the US to the Chinese in exchange for shopping carts full of savings?

        Oh, and “Good News … ” Mitt Romney is calling for sending Ukraine MiGs and is going to run for President as an Independent ala Egg McMuffin last time. The aim is to siphon off enough votes to allow Brandon or Hillary! to “plausibly” win and destroy Trump and Deplorables forever.Hillary is now calling for a Russian hunt — against anyone who ever (besides her of course or her husband) ever said nice things about Putin ever. Yep that’s the sort of too clever by half kind of way the Clintons and Romney roll.They can probably get what they want — but Putin and China won’t play and have their own ways of making life very, very difficult for them. These people have no limits (Romney / Clinton / Brandon) and view themselves again as living gods. Their highest ambition is to pull some clever trick to destroy the deplorables over and over again — it is the only thing that motivates their otherwise utterly empty lives.

        FWIW, Facebook is now allowing people to call for killing Putin, his inner circle, and Russian soldiers and civilians.I guess Zuck, his management team, board members, and major investors like Larry Fink figure Putin is on the ropes, that the media portrayals of him being ousted any day are true, and that there will be absolutely no comeback at all ever for them because their security and screening is just that good. They certainly have not really faced much threats, perhaps they are correct. Yes Putin sent polonium tea to one enemy, nerve gas to another, and lots of others ended up dead somehow. In a continuation of the Soviet Era killings of emigres and defectors. And maybe yes their security is just that good, aided by technology just not able to be defeated …Ed Calderone, a former Mexican Narcotics Enforcement Officer, noted that if someone really wants to get to you its possible, no matter how good the security detail. Perhaps Putin is really beaten and will be in some ICC court next Tuesday. Or perhaps not. At any rate I get the feeling that Western Leaders take Cancel Culture to heart and view it as their primary weapon. And view themselves as living gods, untouchable by anything.

            Putin did none of those things.  Since 1993, there has been an ongoing power struggle in Russia between nationalists such as Putin, versus globalists in the form of Russian oligarchs put in place by the CIA when they came in after the fall of the USSR to “advise” the newly forming state.  Putin has done a fairly decent job of keeping the oligarchs under control, but it is impossible to do it 100%, especially outside Russia.  So every once in a while, the oligarchs get together with their tribal brethren overseas and cook up something that can be pinned on Putin in order to make him look bad.  All the incidents you mentioned were planned and financed by the oligarchs, not Putin.

        Z’s theme today is about America being exposed as major rule breaker over Russia/Ukraine, illegal sanctions, Ukraine bio-lab, etc.  However I think our cover isn’t as blown as he makes it out to be.   Z says a few times that (paraphrasing), “The world sees how brazenly we throw out the rules just because we’re unhappy with Russia.  Just because we’re mad.”But we’ve made it well known that we’re not doing all this just because we’re a bit unhappy.  Rather we’re shocked and outraged.  Putin made is easy for (the Western world at least) to play along with our moral outrage charade…to help us keep the virtue mask on…because Putin really did invade a country.In other words, America STILL gets to keep up its moral standing because of the optics Russia handed it on a silver platter.  He gave us the concrete to build our Godlike statue ever higher.  We’re so boldly moral that we tore up the freakin’ rulebrook in order to save a small country from harm.   This is the Western public perception of it.Until recently I thought Putin played it right from the beginning.  The invasion etc.   I’m not so sure now.  Perhaps he didn’t count on how crazy and stupid we are.  We’re an unpredictable entity even to ourselves.  How do you play chess against that?As far a Z saying this fiasco has made the East trust the U.S. a full level worse than ever.  Dangerously untrusting.  Totally agree with him.

            The idea that the United States of America has any sort of moral standing at all at this point proves just how rigged the whole game is. The USA has invaded dozens of countries. We bomb random third world countries on a daily basis at this point. Hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians have died or been maimed by our hands the past twenty years. The Iraq War wasnt that long ago. A lot of people boldly waving the Ukraine flag and declaring the US to now be in the “fight for freedom” against Russia were rightly outraged by that crime against humanity. Water under the bridge I guess?I really do wonder what will happen to the random American once the globohomo empire finally crumbles for good. Turnabout is fair play after all.

                        Yes, the “Protocols” are likely fiction or even satire. But speaking as one who has studied literature as an academic disciple: Consider that just because something is a work of fiction does not mean that it may not, in places speak truths, sometimes very important ones.It’s also worth calling out your “Jew hater.” remark. Ad hominem is one of the most common, elementary logical fallacies. A person may indeed be an Anti-Semite. But does that have any bearing upon the truth or falsehood of his claims? Calling someone an epithet is the oldest trick in the book, often but not always an implicit admission that one has been defeated in argument.

        No kidding. Have had people Russian hunting the last two days at work.  And of course since we’re subject to both OFAC and UK listings, the incompetents in government can’t even put a coordinated “purge” list together. Some on one list, some on the other.

        Cartels are very low IQ, despite how they’re depicted in the media. They would have difficulty using sophisticated weapons, and would use less sophisticated weapons (rifles) to kill each other. If Putin does fund terrorists, it would be more reliable ones.

                    This is the hell of modern weapons. You can teach your average tard how to use a Javelin in half an hour. Those things are so advanced they do the thinking rather than leaving it to the tard that fired it.So effective are they, that the face of modern warfare has probably changed forever. With a 93% kill ratio – the guy in the tank is a sitting duck. The only counter I see to it is the modern drone – and even they have problems with man-portable shoulder fired weapons.We really, REALLY need to be cognizant of who we are giving these things to. I am not convinced we are allied with the right guys in this conflict, and may well regret arming them in the future.

                        That crash appears to be Third World problems.  It’s a case of the retard POCs.“Pilot Martín Olíva and co-pilot Álvaro Sánchez,[13] were not certified to operate the Learjet 45. The investigation concluded that both pilots had received fraudulent certifications: Captain Olíva lied about the number of training flights he had made, and had issues on the few training flights he did complete, while Captain Sánchez lied about being a Learjet 45 instructor. Both men had taken advantage of a corrupt system to get false training documents and some unsigned Learjet 45 certification forms from their flight schools. These revelations led Mexican authorities to suspend the licences of both flight schools.The descent profile showed that the improperly trained pilots approached the airport with an inconsistent descent angle. The plane descended rapidly and then leveled off in a stepped approach to the airport. The plane did not slow down to the required speed dictated by the air traffic controller, which brought the plane closer to the Mexicana 767-300.Conversation among the flight crew further indicates that they had little familiarity with the operation of the plane; they voiced confusion on several occasions about the cockpit instruments and failed to enter the proper information into the flight computers, did not follow a proper flight plan, and had navigational difficulties, missing their original arrival to San Luis Potosí by over 250 nautical miles (460 km). Further, their in-flight conversations were more of the nature of people driving a car, not of trained pilots following a proper flight plan.The flight crew waited over a minute to follow the order from air traffic control to reduce their speed. The Learjet had been traveling at 262 knots (485 km/h), while the Mexicana 767-300 was flying at 185 knots (343 km/h); this caused the Learjet to get too close to the 767-300.”If true, the above demostrates stunning incompetence that’s on even a different plane than the Atlas Air Jogger who flew the 767 into a swamp.

            That’s true. That was true of Pablo Escobar in Columbia. It still did not stop him from creating havoc. Indeed, the low iq “just for kicks” stuff that was totally counter-productive (blowing up lots of people just to make a point to the powers that be in Columbia) makes such people dangerous. Mexico and Central America do not lack young men with low IQs who would like to very much kill and torture people. Its reversion to the Aztec and Mayan means. One of the many reasons they were conquered so quickly by far outnumber Spaniards was their relative low IQs, and taste for sadistic torture, murder and eating people that created a vast sea of enemies.Just look at the stuff the Mayans and Aztecs created. Can anyone say its beautiful, as opposed to stuff the Greeks created in 500 BC? I’ve seen both in museums. The Greeks created beautiful things that still amaze. Everything the Mayans and Aztecs created was ugly. So there you are. And their very stupidity makes them dangerous in a way that higher IQ people mostly are not (until of course very suddenly they are at much higher scale).

You know that one uses the word “beautiful” to describe ruins.
And the Temple of the Warrior is pretty amazing.  Calamul is kick ass too.   These were smart people.   I live in SoCal.  They’re intelligent.  (When freed from utter poverty.)

                I would tend to agree that Greece and Rome at their best were superior to the indigenous cultures of the Americas. Despite their barbarity I think you unfairly denigrate some of their accomplishments.
While they weren’t on your list, it remains a fact that the Inca created some marvels of architecture whose methods of construction to this day defy reasonable explanation. (e.g. Machu Picchu) Or perhaps you think moving large stones, each weighing many tons, down and up mountains thousands of feet high is something that any primitive society can do?

                    Let’s not go overboard.  The level of advancement was constructing pyramids out of large stones.  Something done 4000 years before in Egypt.  When Greeks were building the Acropolis and launching sea fairing ships, when the Romans built 100 mile aqueducts and perfected the arch and cement and built the Pantheon, the Incas and Aztec were still building pyramids.  They were only a bit more advanced than Blacks—and both had a taste for human flesh.

            A “goof” eh?Is that how we choose to describe prominent figures that mysteriously escaped prosecution and lawsuits that smashed the people following their lead?  So goofy he can be the official public face of evil white people on mainstream magazines… precisely when it was most useful to the regime to associate the new right with evil natsocs.  Although he continues doing his thing completely unmolested by the authorities somehow.Anglin’s boss Weev is a big goof too he goofs around the synagogue with his cousins.Mike Enoch is an extreme goof who was also mysteriously dismissed from the same cases.  He also collects identifying info for concerned white people through the very goofy NJP he founded with some goofy friends.  This was after C-ville showed how viable this sort of thing is.It’s funny that these goofy guys constantly make the right look absurd and eliminate any possible appeal it might organically have for enormous numbers of disaffected decent white people.

        I said a while back that a serious body blow to the American empire was Tapioca Joe’s unilateral cancellation of the Keystone Pipeline.It established with a big, ugly exclamation point that productive businesses can no longer trust in procedure and the rule of law. Any enterprise they attempt to engage in may be shut down unilaterally (or greenlit unilaterally) based on the whims of the Emperor (er, I mean “President”). That’s some serious banana Republic stuff there: what’s important is who you know and who you can bribe. The fact that you dotted all your i’s and crossed all your t’s and adhered to the rules doesn’t matter. We see that sort of stuff in Latin American countries and it’s a nation-destroying cancer.Hernando de Solo wrote all about it in “The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else”https://www.amazon.com/Mystery-Capital-Capitalism-Triumphs-Everywhere/dp/0465016154De Soto, writing in 2003, hoped that he could persuade the developing world to be more like the West in respecting property rights, contracts and the rule of law.In what Severian would call an Alannis-level irony, instead the West has deteriorated to Latin American governance. Rapidly sinking toward Africa-level.Now trying to apply that to global geopolitics is insane. It simply means that Russia, China and whoever decides to side with them can simply say — and rightly so — “Your system is untrustworthy. We are therefore starting our own system in which we can trust. Nations who wish for an alternative the global Western dictatorship should consider joining us. Bye.”

                    This may be true, but the mud people are terrific weapons for the elites. In fact, without the mud people, the elites wouldn’t have nearly the power they have now.Using these dusky weapons, the elites have ethnically cleansed our cities, made white children hate themselves, lowered academic standards, toppled our statues, and made grown men and women cower, lest they be accused of racism. Hell, even election integrity is now considered racist, especially when our largest cities are controlled by people not like us.I could go on, but the point remains, much of this wouldn’t be possible without the endless sea of black and brown bodies.

                        American white youth seem to be far more self hating than Canadian, Brazilian, British, Australian, or any other nation – from what I’ve seen online anyways.Is this due to the presence of violent African savages that makes white boys feel weaker growing up? Is the media push that much stronger there, being the seat of the Globohomo empire? Is it because most white kids growing up in America have loser fathers who are obsessed with African sportsball players instead of their own families?Younger white guys in Canada seem fine in general, lots of well dressed and good looking guys. Definitely lacking enough racial conscience and too liberal, but who isn’t these days. Our problem is seems to be mass immigration moreso than complete moral and social collapse amongst the White population.

            “Now trying to apply that to global geopolitics is insane.”Great post.I think what we are watching is the next stage in their Great Reset and in their Climate-Change (from what?) religion.The Western plutocrats *must* take possession of Russia’s fabulous wealth in untapped natural resources, or they are finished. Washed up. Done for. And they know it.We have known this since August of 2019, when the Fed Chairman (Jerome Powell) held a press conference to announce that the Fed was opening “a special Repo market window for foreign central banks. That told us that the US Federal Reserve System had become–by default–the world’s lender of last resort because banks around the world had become too unstable and frightened to lend money even to other banks–even overnight.It was an unofficial announcement of the death of Socialism. But Socialism wasn’t going to go quietly.In January 2020, the Bank of Japan announced that they would by Japanese gov’t debt “without limit.”Immediately after that, the Chinkypox Pandemic was proclaimed.NOW it’s Climate Change,, resource wars, and the Great Reset because super-low interest rates–and in some places even negative rates–have destroyed the pension funds of the world–Socialism’s progeny.What’s a Justin Trudeau or an Angela Merkel to do? Tell the truth and be torn to pieces in the streets?Well, no! Never. Instead, we can proclaim a pandemic killing millions and deliberately destroy the world economy. And later on we can proclaim ourselves the saviours of mankind!But people got tired of the Chinkypox. So they got the Ministry of Truth to tell the imbeciles of the world that “the bully Putin” had invaded the Ukraine *unprovoked.* The Ministry of Truth then told the imbeciles to tie yellow ribbons around things and talk tough and stop drinking vodka, because those actions have never failed to strike terror into the hearts of all bullies and tyrants throughout history, as those who know history will tell you, even if you don’t ask them (for they are a generous lot).And those weapons in Afghanistan–the ones that the Ministry of Truth tells us were “abandoned” there–well, gosh, it turns out are a lot closer to Russia and the Ukraine than they would have been had anybody thought to pack them when they were barging OUT of Afghanistan. Instead of packing the weapons, though, they packed tens of thousands of “translators” whom they delivered under cover of “darkness” (!) to “red” districts around AINO.This war is just getting started. It is not going to wind down. There will not be a “settlement.” It’s the next phase of the Great Reset.Keep your eyes and ears open for the subject of digital “currency.”There is already a *declared* shortage of cash–not coins (that was the chinkypox narrative)–but a shortage *now* of paper money.The Great Reset is alive and well.

                Have you not considered that its a war to wall off the west from hydrocarbon energy and Gaia’s resources?
They don’t want Russian energy or material. Instead we are going to be a gulag archipelago of energy poverty countries in a great experiment to see if society can actually exist in that manner.
While Russia and China stays as a hydrocarbon energy block.
The great reset may be more an attempt to  reverse  the industrial revolution than you think.

                    The Great Resetters mean to take full possession and ownership of Russia’s incredible natural resources. And Russia and China are to be *forced* to go along with the Great Reset/Green New Deal.The plutocrats don’t mean to wall anybody off from anything. They intend to redistribute the (remaining) populations of the whole world according to their land-use maps, which are all online. Everyone is to be “housed” in stack-em-and-pack-em apartment blocks in “walkable” and “sustainable” cities.It’s UN Agenda 21 and UN Agenda 2030.But the *timing* was to save themselves from being torn to pieces after wrecking the whole world, which was the only possible end of Socialism. Which is why the pension fund crisis has produced the greatest danger to them. Therefore–universal basic income paid out in the form a digital “currency.” More accurately described as a credit at the company store.

            Demographics are destiny. You can pull off 3rd world shit as a leader without blowback… But you also get 3rd world level competency. That means as a rich person you can’t do things like make your country fight a war, maintain weapons systems, extract resources efficiently, step outside your gated compound safely… When the value of the dollar is worthless what are you going to pay your security detail with?What are our elites planning to do once they destroy North America and Europe? They can’t flee to South America, most of the rich have already left those places for the North. Flee to China? That seems to be the only option for them if they want to live in a reasonably developed nation where they can actually enjoy their lifestyle.I used to think it was some grand conspiracy but now I’m not really sure. They might actually just be really stupid, hateful, scared, and inbred.

                I’m sure that’s an important part of it. Remember, de Soto is a Peruvian and wants to believe that it is possible for his people to advance, so he probably has strong personal interest in not believing that his people are inherently less able to develop those institutions.

        Mindless rule following is a large part of what drives the COVID hysteria. Whether vaccines, masks, or distancing, actually work is secondary – you aren’t doing as you’re told (by your superiors), and thus you are a Bad Person.For these people non compliance is scary. It means you might not act in a predictable way, and that could threaten the Good Person’s delusional, make believe worldview and material comfort. Their whole world order. They are willing to do anything to stay peacefully deluded – look at how Trudeau nearly wrecked the entire Canadian banking system just to punish some Bad People truckers who parked in an improper location.Rule following is not necessarily a bad thing. It allowed the prosperity of the Anglo-Germanic world to develop and increase significantly. The problem is that the people handing down the orders are a) insane &amp; hateful b) often no longer actually our people (and if they are it’s soy males and females) and c) weaponizing these instincts against our own societies.Today not giving a f*** about the rules is a far more advantageous trait, that’s why I’m not a depressed, frail, drug addled wreck locked in my basement over a flu virus

            I raised a few eyebrows today at work. We were talking about all the silly rules (mostly covid-related). I said that management can make and enforce all the rules they want, and I would comply only enough to keep my job, but it was NOT my job to make their job easier.
I believe that is called, “Malicious Compliance”.

        The demonization of German culture never stopped after WW2. Instead, after a few decades, it became a systematic campaign to wipe out German society by cultural genocide and demographic replacement. What then happened was, these chicken came home to roost with the victors of that war. Britain, a country with a glorious history almost unique, is now the most self-loathing society after the Germans. And in America, we are only 2-3 steps away from making it outright illegal to be white.This genocide by denigrating everything about Western culture, promoting everything that history says is extremely dysgenic and by demographic replacement in EVERY WESTERN COUNTRY, is very probably the greatest crime in all of history. It even manages to combine genocide with the pinnacle of high treason. This is the true face of Globohomo. This is our ultimate enemy. And they want your grandchildren dead!

            “And they want your grandchildren dead!”
Well, if your grandchildren are already born, then yes, they want them dead. But what is even nearer and dearer to their black hearts is that your grandchildren should never even be conceived and, if they are, that they should be aborted. “They don’t want your grandchildren in their world” is the bottom line, and the methods for accomplishing that are immaterial.
(Of course, I meant “African-American hearts” not “black” hearts.)

Of course there’s no obvious way to GET there now and unless you speak with a native accent you’re now a visible member of a deservedly hated national enemy so…
But a couple white guys did this in North Korea and that seemed to have worked out okay.  I think they even got state pensions and acting roles in propaganda movies

                I also fear the worst about the vaxx but am not nailing my colors to the mast on it being a deliberate act of genocide; I remain agnostic/open minded about how bad it is, from worst to relatively innocuous. Imagine future developments will show how bad it is. For now I would just recommend that people NOT take the jab, or more jabs.

                    You can see it leaking out everywhere despite the attempts to deny and smother the reports.
All the data and VERY large numbers of heart/menstrual/immune system reports in young people suggest a massively shortened life expectancy and fertility which is only going to get worse as people age.
I expect they thought the increasing deaths would get rolled into a dispersed set of illnesses over time which would make it impossible for cause and effect to be proven.

                        Agree, VERY disturbing data and signs appear to be seeping through the MSM veil of denial. The really dark ‘conspiracy theories’ about the jab COULD be real (not assigning/gauging a probability of that for now but it is on the chart). Keep away from the jab and I guess the pattern will become clearer with time.

        “What this war has done is bring us to the winter phase of the Global American Empire.”And now the GAE is promoting the possibility of a “nuclear winter phase” to keep the normies in line. I, for one, am not even sure that nukes exist in numbers sufficient to achieve this. It always was a scam to fatten the wallets of the military-industrial complex. “Well, guys, we’ve got 100 nukes now. Let’s just tell the peasants we have a thousand and the Russkies have 800 so they’ll support our goals.” You even have to ask, how many of those nukes work anymore.

            Intel community rumors say that significant numbers of American nukes are now duds whereas the Russian ones are shiny new. For example, America has had major problems producing tritium, a hydrogen isotope necessary for thermonuclear war heads that needs to be replaced regularly. Russia has no such problems. America’s only deployed land-based ICBM is the Minuteman III, a 1960s design. Russia’s latest are three generations newer. America still flies the B-52 in numbers. When the last B-52 rolled out of Boeings factory, Dealey Plaza was just a random place in Dallas… This COULD be rather one-sided…..

                What I’d also heard, and am willing to be corrected of course, is that the material on nukes carried by the submarines isn;’t as “hot”, so the crew doesn’t get cooked, and thus more stable for a longer period of time.  Probably not the same payload but I’d imagine a boomer full of nukes is still enough to ruin any country’s day.  (Extending that rumor even further, that was supposedly why the GAE never put any more effort into their land based nukes.  First because “effort” and second because the subs were always the real deterrent anyway).

                    Didn’t know that SLBMs had less ‘hot’ loads but that is certainly possible. And I agree with you that the US boomer subs are America’s strongest nuclear card and genuinely terrifying weapons. Moscow, or Beijing, would be completely insane to bank on what may work or may not work in the American inventory. I don’t think they want to find out anymore than anyone else. Perhaps my point above was just to say that even the strategic nuclear forces have not been kept free from the general incompetence promotion in society.

                    You are correct the subs are the real deterrent. Mass recognition of this is whyThe Hunt for Red Octoberbecame a cultural phenomenon. That is also one of the rare situations where the film does a good job honoring the source novel.The theory behind the ground-based nukes in fixed silos is that they are really there to soak up a certain percentage of the enemy’s nuclear warheads in an exchange.It makes sense, I mean, you can’t really afford to ignore those facilities and leave them operational for a counterstrike.I feel sorry for the folks in the beautiful states of  Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, etc. that are stuck living next to those facilities.

                The other thing the Russians allegedly have, that the US does not are tactical nukes. The numbers thrown around are something like 2000 to 200 in favor of Russia.
This kind of nuke would be in the kiloton yield range and be fired as an artillery shell or air-to-ground missile.
Then again, after looking into all the thermobaric munitions the Russians have, I’m not sure they need the tac nukes.
Well, except when they need something to fire in the rain, which seriously impedes the thermobaric effect.

Of course Russia is aware of this and specializes in bunker busters . They also have no issue with “You harbor my enemies, you are a target.” So N-Zed is a valid target in such cases.

                Tritium is being reprocessed from the old nukes being decommissioned.  Tritium is an “exciter” which increases yield.  Our standard nukes are “dial a yield”.  That’s a convenience, not a necessity.  The nukes dropped on Japan had no such mechanism.  I doubt we have any shortage of viable nukes on hand. Obama in his first term authorized a $1T nuke upgrade program.  The results/progress are secret of course, but I doubt we have a bunch of faulty/obsolete weapons classified as operational sitting around.  Sort of like we don’t have any biological weapons either.

Two of the airmen at Minot told McClatchy the facility’s missile guidance system often needs parts or attention because of constant wear and tear. “You can only do that so many times until the system fails,” said Lt. Col. Steve Bonin, commander of the 91st Operations Support Squadron at Minot.And note our people would absolutely lie about the nukes working. So would I  if I was in charge and inherited that problem.My guess is the land based will go but the  sub nukes will work for some time until the tritium is gone but after that its anyone’s guess.

                “This COULD be rather one-sided…..”
Moreover, Russia has never stopped civil defense drills and preparations.
We stopped that decades ago.
They are ready for anything.
We have grief counselors for everything.

        Heads up.
Russia is now in the process of dropping a nuke at the UN in regard to documentation of biological weapons research funded directly by DoD in Ukraine and focused on using migrating birds and invasive insect vectors for dispersing pandemic-scale contagions into European and Asian landmasses. The US government is countering by placing Potato Head at news conference podium later today. Faith in the USA is about to tank big-time. And Putin is now trying to “flip” Zelensky in exchange for peace. How far we have fallen.

            (To TomA) I think that your comments are well stated and get right to the point. However, I have essentially reached the point of despair when it comes to these matters. What I mean is that the Russians can SAY that the US has bio-labs in the Ukraine, and the Russians can PROVE that these bio-labs were being used to develop “weapons” that could be dispersed all over the place, in a variety of ways.But the US will simply say, “No, we don’t have any labs there.” When the Russians then say, “But, Vicky Nuland has admitted that the US has labs in Ukraine” the US will counter with, “Yes, we have labs there. But they are for the purpose of countering the biological warfare of the Russians.”In other words, they will simply lie. They lie all the time. And surely the US knows that the American people are now fully united against the evil Putler. Whatever proof the Russians have of our malfeasance in Ukrainian bio-labs, we will counter their proof with, “We dindu nuffin.” And we’ll get away with it.

            It is hard to know what to make of the bioweapons lab. We know two things now:1. They exist.2. They were put in a dangerous, unstable place.What we do not know is why and for what purpose. Do the Russians know these things? Do the Chinese?To belabor the obvious, the UN preceded Clown World as Clown World, but this is going to be difficult to keep under wraps if things spill out that make the United States a further pariah. If the United States boycotts or demands a secret session, it is game, set, match. At a minimum, we are about to enter a new phase of the propaganda war. If the Russians have the goods, and we do not know yet, this could be devastating, particularly if the United States was responsible for Covid (I have no clue but have seen pretty strong cases made for it).

Yeah, a German newspaper man named Udo or Uwe Something-of-other wrote a book about it when he retired. Said point blank that the enntire Germany journalism profession/business was controlled outright by the CIA and they published anything they were told to publish. That’s been maybe 10 yrs of so ago. Most of you will remember that.

        We are living under something akin to the Nuremberg laws/trials.  The law is whatever they say the law is at the time that they say it.  There is no rule of law.  The law, like big-social TOS has been weaponized.We’re seeing this both as victims and perpetrators.  There are a few stories floating around right now about a 25 yo bm beating a 70 something year old wm to death getting house arrest and another story of a group of men who gang raped a 14 yo girl they got drunk getting no jail time.

            The young Black that beat the old White did so because the old White called the young Black a “jogger”.  The judge in sentencing said that he took this into consideration in sentence.I leave it to this group’s imagination to consider what would happen to you if you beat an old Black to death for calling you a “cracker”.  🙁In all fairness however, the young Black only hit the old White once and the old White hit the floor with the back of his head.  It would be a lessor type of murder.  However for example, a drunk driver than kills will get 4-10 years in prison—pretty standard.

                I respectfully disagree with that.  Getting drunk and killing someone is criminally negligent.  IMHO, 2nd degree murder or manslaughter rises well above negligence.  I would think justice was served if he got manslaughter and 10 years.People die in fist-fights a lot.  Fist fights where both combatants are young and healthy and mutual combatants, and they usually get prison time.  This was a man punching a man 3 times his age allegedly because of words.  He either knew or should have known that punching an old man like that could cause serious bodily injury or death.  The ONLY mitigating circumstances I can think of is the legal concept of “fighting words,” but I don’t what the white man said rises to that level.If some older African American called me a cracker or something, that last thing that would cross my mind is to punch him in the face.

Oh, it wouldn’t be nearly the last thing that *crossed my mind*, but it would be the last thing I’d *do*.

                    Tars, don’t know where you live, but in my State it’s murder if you kill with a car while drunk.   As I said, there are levels of murder, but it’s homicide all the same.  Vehicular manslaughter to be exact.  Same as assaulting someone that your fists who then dies.  Also, here the sentence would be “enhanced” as an adult over 65 is considered a “vulnerable adult” and is basically given the same “special” protection in law as a child would be given.

        I just read a book on the Nuremberg trials, never realized that the men on trial weren’t allowed to wear their uniforms adorned with medals and patches during the proceedings. A new rule, Against the rule of international trials. The Russian judges on the the other hand wore their medals in all their shining glory. Take that Herman!

            ” … weren’t allowed to wear their uniforms … .”The convicted were denied the honorable death of a soldier (firing squad) and instead were hanged, suffering the ignominious death of a common criminal.Yankee Puritanism in action. The presiding judge was a New England Yankee.The trials were for the purpose of humiliation and demoralization, not for anything like justice. The accused were charged with extra-legal “Crimes.” Things against which there was no law at that time or even before the war.The whole thing was a travesty, and it ought to have been a permanent shame to the people whose government and army had stooped to such low-down, vengeful, and lawless antics.But those things were the product of a different (((mentality))) just as were the ridiculously childish and physically impossible (((stories))) of lampshades made of human skin.

                It was not “lawless”, but it was major hypocrisy.  The victor in all previous wars always did what they willed to the defeated.  That’s war—and war is an existential matter.  We just decided to dress it up and parade around as if we were not as blood thirsty (revengeful) as the defeated would have been had the shoe been on the other foot.

                    Point taken, but I’m still going to use the word “lawless” to describe the “trials” b/c they prosecuted people on charges based upon laws that didn’t exist at the time of the “trials” and had *never* existed, and *that* is lawless. Our own constitution protects us against ex post facto laws, but that was tossed aside in favor of (((propaganda))) and (((vengeance))).
Major hypocrisy, yes, but also lawless.

        “What the Russo-Ukrainian war is testing is whether Karen culture can become a ruling ideology of the Global American Empire. Russia is unhappy with NATO and Ukraine, so Washington demanded to speak to Russia’s manager. When that failed, they launched a de-platforming campaign on social media. Millions of American zombies have joined in on the campaign to destroy Russia.”Aside from making sense that was genuinely good comedy. The Western reaction to the Ukraine war is extremely Karen. Neither rulers nor the 80 (90?)% sheep realize how completely ridiculous their boycott of all things Russian, looks. Youporn, a porn channel as the name suggests, cutting out Russia was possibly the high point; “If you’re going to be anti-degeneracy, no more of our prime decadence products for you!” Leaves me wondering what I need to invade to be spared the flood of decadence lol

            That’s something we all need to ask every Ukraine flag pin wearer in our lives, every single day: “Who do we have to invade to get OnlyFans and Netflix and Facebook banned here?” It comes at them obliquely.

True, unfortunately. These cretins will clap along, possibly masked and properly socially distanced, as the ICBM’s race toward us. Lord knows I resisted it, but we share a continent with people who want us dead and people who don’t think people want us dead.

                Indeed it is. Forcing sexual deviancy into everyone’s face and then forcing everyone to smile at it, is central to their nihilistic, genocidal impulses. Globohomo know they are FAR beyond what people were historically executed for. And they are getting desperate as they realize the hoi polloi are catching onto them. They may conceivably prefer nuclear war to the guillotine they subconsciously know they deserve and this may be the real danger soon.

Why do I love MSNBC Morning Joe?
Because, as Saml says–They have a wolf by the ears.
One thing is odd, though- the Highest IQ People people rule Kiev, but they don’t seem to do any of their own fighting.
******
p.s.– today: “Stop saying military aid, and start saying Declaration of War.”
The appetizer was “(the 350,00 J**s of) Ukraine threatened by a nuclear holocaust” (ashes, drifting down like snow…)–
But the threat between the lines was “Putin” pulling a 9/11, using biological weapons…!!

        I am interested in something I heard sometime ago (and it might be fake news, so I reserve the right to be wrong). I’d heard that Putin had decided to put the rumble back on the gold standard. I am not an economist – but I assume that comes as a response to defend against currency manipulation by hostile countries like the US?And why is this all happening? People are going nuts out there. I can’t believe Biden and Turdo are still in office after what they’ve done. I can’t speak for Biden… but in the last month, Turdo should have triggered AT LEAST six votes of non-confidence that should have swept him and his pikers out of office… and there’s crickets.On a slightly positive note…I am seeing some of the mass media rag sheets starting to run the odd objective articles. It’s far too little and far to late… but they are beginning to see their problems more clearly. Maybe our rulers will too…

            “And why is this all happening?”
Because everything is cyclical, and it’s time for war now.
But if you don’t buy that, ask yourself how the war started? Who forced it to happen? How? Using what?
(And yes, it *was* the usual suspects.)
Did you follow the Munich Security Conference (last month) at all?
What happened there? And what happened later that same week?
Zelinsky announced that the Ukraine was going to acquire nuclear weapons. Putin began his police action later that same week.
But that’s just the proximate cause. The “whys” are more complicated and of longer standing.

        Kudos to acknowledging Putin is being deplatformed. Yes, these people–and there is a lot of them–believe Twitter is real life. Wonder what will happen to them when electricity and ISP’s fail and “real life” disappears?The hypocrisy the United States embraces has rendered it a joke. A few days ago ideas were being digitally floated about trying Putin for war crimes. How that would happen was never explained, but as casualty lists from Iraq and Libya and Syria were compared to the number of dead in the Ukraine, that meme disappeared for some reason. The Iraq War really rendered the United States a nullity.

            It’s our first war where diplomatic postures (and possibly actual military decisions) are based on “social media metrics”—as Western domestic policy has been for years.During that time they’ve censored all real dissenters from the measured entities. (Keep a list of “our” guys who haven’t seen any trouble on mainstream social media. It won’t be a perfect list, but it won’t be far from it.) So the metrics have gone full GIGO.That’s not why US election cheating happens, but it’s why it has to be massive and last-minute. It’s not why Canada declared martial law, but it is why its leadership was shocked that calling protestors transphobes three times didn’t make them run home crying. Etc., etc.They always meet the world *stunned*.

Tik Tok is a venture of two Chinese companies. Interesting to see whether this is permitted or not by the Chinese authorities, won’t it?

Same thing will happen to most of them as will happen to most of us.  They’ll die.
Knowing why this is happening or even predicting it makes no difference.  A garage full of MREs and some boxes of 22lr will make no diference.  If the global economic and logistic system crashes we’d be unbelievably fortunate if the death toll was in the millions, billions seems more probable.
A lot of us are far too cavalier about that sort of outcome.

                Middle aged people which is like nearly everyone on this blog is are fair closer to death than youth.All of us are dying just some slower than others so a little callousness makes the losses cultural and personal  easier to bear.Still even if globo-homo somehow wins its still doomed. No one that ascribes to its views or to modernity in general has children. They don’t get a future period.All those billions will die in time and no one will follow them.Over that period the damage we’ve done to land and water will catch up with us and the people that do reproduce, will be in smaller numbers.Futurism is just as doomed while the suffering would suck as the Viking said Cattle die kinsmen die all men are mortal

                    And further to that point (and something I posted yesterday) there is yet another BBC story on how Putin is “setting the stage to use chemical weapons”.
The false flag prep is strong, narratised and so clumsy it seems certain they have decided to go this route to kick off NATO action in Europe.
They have exhausted sanctions so it looks like they are going to carry through on the full on suicide.

                        I’m afraid a full on suicide is quite possible. Some of the recent recklessness indicates as much. You do have to wonder if Putin and Xi truly appreciated how batshit crazy the United States/GAE had become.

                        “They have exhausted sanctions so it looks like they are going to carry through on the full on suicide.”Yes, but I don’t think they mean to do it next week,Their move is already underway. They are going to “sponsor” in “insurgency” in the Ukraine in hopes of bleeding Russia white, and then managing to get their hands on Russia’s natural resources, which is what this is all about.They will use mercenaries in the Ukraine. They have a huge cache of modern weaponry in Afghanistan. That’s why they left it there. It obviates an otherwise difficult logistical problem, and war is logistics.Things are just getting started. There’s a long way to go yet.

                It will be much worse than that. Mexico is filled with ever splintering cartels and no shortage of young men who really, really like killing people. A bit of money and direction (Putin has both) and the sort of stuff that Mexico calls Tuesday will happen here all the time. And once started it cannot be turned off save wholesale ethnic cleansing ala Yugoslavia.Social Media is also a two edged sword. The Japanese military in the 1930s heavily funded the Moorish Temple then Nation of Islam. For obvious reasons. Multiply that by 100 and you get another easy strike. Putin has been generous and merciful so far by historical standards.

                    “A bit of money and direction (Putin has both) and the sort of stuff that Mexico calls Tuesday will happen here all the time.”Good thinking. I hadn’t thought of that, but I have wondered by Putin hasn’t already activated Russian assets here in the States. Fifty years of no border control plus multiple murderous adventures overseas is a recipe for disaster here at home.Drop the Wilkinson Bridge at Baton Rouge into the Mississippi and shut down the entire Mississippi-Platte-Ohio-Allagheney-Muskingum drainage system–nearly the whole continent.Shut down the power grid. That can be done by small groups without an EMP.There are many options. But *all* of them fit hand-in-glove into the plans for the Great Reset.

                Good God, I hope not. For one thing, I believe that this volunteering impulse is more rhetorical than anything else. If RT is to be believed, there were Americans and other Westerners who sympathized with the…let’s just call them Novorosiyans for reasons of brevity. For another, I just hope this thing ends  ASAP. A more definitively Ukrainian nation will emerge, but the longer the war lasts, the less chivalrous Moscow will be in regards to the boundaries and degree of autonomy of this newly-fashioned nation-state.

C’Mon down to Crazy Ivan’s House of Warplanes Comrade!
I’ve got MiGs, Sukhois, Tupolevs, all waiting to “fly” off the lot Comrade!
Take this Sukhoi SU-27. All original, low flight hours, only used to bomb Afghan tribesmen.
Or this MiG-29 two seater. Perfect for family man, extra room.
I’ve got deals for low credit, no credit, nobody walks from Crazy Ivan’s!

        Talk about “rules.”  Poland and Hungary have taken in more refugees from Ukraine than any other EU nation, close to two million altogether. And what did the EU just do to them, under the fig leaf of these nations violating “rule-of-law?” Sanction them. Why? Insufficient obeisance at the altar of LGBTQ degeneracy.I give you the backstory then the news today:https://www.politico.eu/article/meps-protection-lgbtq-families-sanctions-poland-hungary/https://www.outono.net/elentir/2022/03/10/the-parties-that-supported-sanctions-on-poland-and-hungary-in-the-midst-of-a-wave-of-refugees/

The actions of US embassies around the world with regard to the alphabet soup flag should make it abundantly clear that they have made it into ade factosymbol of GAE.
It’s instructive that their main object of pride during the completely disastrous Afghanistan pullout was flying the alphabet soup flag over Kabul.

        I think it is important to remember that this is a controlled demolition. Our government is doing everything it can to force the rest of the world out of our orbit of control.I believe the destruction of the American empire is a good thing and a forgone conclusion, but the fact that they are doing so much to hasten things along tells me that this is all part of the great reset.Get ready for hard times and never submit.

            I agree with you, but ask for one clarification: Who is “our government”? If you say the miasmic bog of international bankers, IMF, UN, BIS, WEF, etc., I would completely agree. I think people see the idiots like Biden and Rubio and assume they call the shots. In this instance, yes, they are incompetent buffoons. However, they are buffoons in employ of much more competent people. Was PT Barnum a buffoon? He employed them. The crowd in the circus may believe he is a buffoon through association. However, they fail to pierce the veil that separates the puppet from the puppeteer, and thus they assume it is all clown play. He got his money from them (a sucker born every minute – whether he said it or not). Our overlords are getting what they want through a perceived veil of stupidity.Allow me to illustrate another way. I think we can all agree that these people are acolytes of the new world religion. However, who is the messiah who taught them? Even if a religion does not require a singular Jim Jones/ messiah type, it still requires a ruling council to organize it. Who are the people running this Council of Nicaea? If you propose some person form a 100 years ago and it has snowballed, I would argue that even the most superstitious voodoo Haitian has a high priestess that keeps the flock in order. Who of the buffoons we see on TV is competent enough to keep these morons enlivened?

                In the current iteration of GAE, I believe the most important governing bodies are Blackrock, Vanguard, and State Street.
The not quite secret king is Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock. He continues to be an enormous driver of ESG and DIE in the GAE.

                    Wild Geese Howard nails it, except perhaps for one thing: Larry Fink. The guy is too visible. I admit to the possibility of being wrong about this, but I strongly suspect that Fink is merely a front man. The people with serious power are smart enough to stay in the shadows. For instance, it’s very difficult to even find out who exactly owns Vanguard. Again, I could be wrong about this. Fink may well be a major driver of these destructive phenomena. I simply doubt we would even know his name if that was the case.

                        The visibility of Fink is curious. The same with Soros, who is calling for regime change in both CHINA and Russia. Let me state that calling for Xi to be deposed and replaced–which Soros has done–shows these people are on the ropes and dangerous to us all. Having a seeming front man like Soros do so shows his puppeteers have gone to ground already.

                        I agree with both of you. Geese is dead on about those Vanguard. And Wkathman is right on about Fink as a probably frontman, even Fink’s name is a hint at this. Names have power, and elite group could never really share the power or glory with a frontman.I would add that the membership of Vanguard and Blackrock are opaque, they are all probably mixed together with many of those other organizations. IMF has been great for breaking countries outside the direct flow of western/ global economics, UN is great for governance and military forces, BIS for domestic central banks, etc., and so I tend to view them all as heads of the same hydra because their membership lists at the top strata are probably identical.

I think that will be the moment of maximum danger. And they will have calculated and gamed outresistance of all kinds. So they might say that their digidollar is the only way to pay your taxes. Or the penalty for refusing the digidollar is death. Whatever–they will have their clubs and cudgels at the ready *before* they roll it out.

                One of the strengths of the corporatist model of rule is that just about everyone in that model is fungible, making them easily replaced. This is especially true in bureaucratic fields that specialize in paper pushing.
Based on that, I don’t hold out much hope that people will be able to distinguish key players among the grey goo of corporate personnel pools.

                    The key to dealing with this sort of an entity is to make staffing the critical role impossible. You don’t need to kill CEOs, you need to kill people who are a step or two above bottom rung. In a bank, that would be loan officer; in retail, inventory manager. Effectively, law enforcement can’t protect all these people, but if the jobs go unstaffed, the organization will be referred effectively impotent. So, you can pretty much be guaranteed to take out a large number of these people easily, and be guaranteed that no one wants to be promoted.

            Linh Dinh (who used to write for Unz Review–I don’t know where he is these days) recently wrote that “No real change will occur in this world until the first significant assassinations take place.”
An interesting take on things, don’t you think?

                No. Many more kings have been assassinated than kingdoms destroyed in the annals of history. Changing the system is only possible when there’s a parallel organization to take it’s place, already existing.

        An axiom of the modern era will become “no rules means no rules”, and even more importantly, it means “no rules” eventually becomes a two-way street. But there is an essential difference between the two camps when “no rules” dominates all social interactions. The Cloud People, due to their positioning of power and ostentatious display of wealth, are easily identifiable and relatively few in numbers. Whereas, the Dirt People are diffuse, indistinguishable, and omnipresent. As such, focus is a liability for the Cloud People and effectively useless on the Dirt People. The former must be constantly looking over their shoulder, whereas the latter is like the atmosphere, it’s rarely noticed at all except in the aggregate or when a storm arises. A lion is king when the jackals are few, but easily trampled by a herd of stampeding water buffalo.

            They mostly fly in a different universe to everyone else. Not everyone is Bezos, but enough of them at the moment have few touch points with the rest of the world.
They will bring the entire resources and force of the govt and your tax base to protect themselves and make sure you don’t interfere with them.
It mostly depends on how long they can keep that racket going.
Its a long way from there to a French style revolt.

                The over-class is largely invisible to us. I’ve pointed out in the past that foreign policy, as an example, is controlled by maybe fifty people. There are maybe three dozen people in Washington and an equal amount outside, but with strong ties to the system. None of these people are known to the typical American. Until thus week, few people had ever heard of Victoria Nuland, who is running Russia policy. Robert Kagan is known only to people who study this stuff.This is repeated across all sectors of the managerial class. Each area has an elite that control the administrative layer, which runs policy for their area. It is why elections have no consequence. Regardless of the party or president, the same cabal of neocons control foreign policy. The same bankers control monetary policy. The same regulators control regulatory policy.

                    All true, but can the self-anointed leadership hold and remain cohesive as the international pie gets smaller and the slices get smaller? All revolutions start when the elites turn on one another. This will be no different.
Prediction: some of the leadership will become pro-China/Russia/Iran (this is the case now) and some will become strident opponents based on who gets spoils from where. That will be the great fracture.

                    I agree 100%.
The unity of the supra-national orgs combined with media circus on minion personalities, and a lack of examination as to the relationships in the top tier means nearly everyone has no idea who the movers actually are (including me).
Its why you get clowns like Schwabb in his Ming outfits as a narrative fulcrum.

                    true for the very top layer.  but all of the supporting layers are very visible.  and they will be easily dismantled.  the fundamental problem with the cloud people is they have concentrated too many resources in too few hands.  the system is wildly unbalanced.now they have created  a classic pincer situation; one “arm” is their war internally, on us; the other is the new war they just started externally, on the rest of the world.   the pozzed corporations will be cleansed or crushed, the pozzed institutions likewise.   who will protect harvard when it is being torched?  or the WHO?and that top layer is as helpless as a baby deer, in reality, because no one likes them, no one will follow them into battle, and lots of people are envious of what they have.

                    The anonymity of the power-players with respect to the masses is a reality of human nature. Most common folk don’t give a damn about the machinations of DC and have more important things to do with their time than read the pages of the Washington Post or New York Times. And that only matters if you still think we can talk or vote our way out of the mess we’re in.

Do you think they would tie together the same people are responsible for both?
Seems pretty easy they could say “look evil pfizer” and then would carry on providing more “solutions” to the problems they created.
As we see now with inflation. Most people can’t even join together it is the lockdowns worldwide  that caused most of it.

                As the pie gets smaller, as it must as the empire contracts, the revolution will start among the elites, as it always does, over spoils.
