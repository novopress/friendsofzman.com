        Next week NY Times will be more interesting with follow up columns by the other editorial writers. Gail Collins will try Crystal Meth, David Brooks will drop acid, Charles Blow will participate in a Hopi peyote ritual and Ross Douthat will drink a bottle of absinthe.

        Don’t be silly, TV(SOME music, “social” networks, public school “policy”) doesn’t CAUSE “children” (no age limit) to misbehave, it merely promotes, enables, “justifies”, excuses,  and inspires them to do so.

        Medical marijuana is very different from old school pot. Most of it is bred for people with pain issues. It tends to pretty much knock you out. And, if smoked, it’s not wise to deeply inhale. It doesn’t take much. (I had a paraplegic friend that raised his own medical marijuana. It is the only thing that works for his leg spasms. He spent a year in the local jail for growing it, before he was able to get the license.)Having said that, I just don’t buy that she had hallucinations. I’m sure she overdosed and panicked. The question is, should she go to jail for something like that? I don’t think so.
