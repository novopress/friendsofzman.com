        While not impossible, is it not apparent that there’s no “someone else’s” money-for-nothing  to be had without “current victim” status, in tomorrows “civil” class action suit? Let the fighting over who’s the more “authentic” victim, once the zero sum of limited “restitution” amount is revealed, commence. At LEAST until the common  vocabulary has been disingenuously altered by a NEW generation of  rent seeker “activists”.Is Dickens’ “Bleak House” required reading any more in mandatory, union supervised, with gub’mint funding “common core considerations”, PreK-12 public “education”?Is Atlas Shrugged?Aesop’s Fables?

        “That is, how do you get to the promised land. Pagans believed a noble death was the ticket. Christians believed a noble life was the answer. Modern liberals believe amnesia is the solution.”Well put….progressive minds always attempting the impossible, readjusting the now to what they want it to be.
thanks for the post Dave
