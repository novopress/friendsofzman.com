        Couple little data points that give hope.  First, in our little burg, despite Republicans been being the minority, we actually had Democrats secretly asking us to get a slate together for the local elections.  Bizarre?  Well apparently the leftist cat ladies have so dominated and intimidated the remainder‚Ä¶and nominated their pet leftist slate that the normies over there desperately wanted an alternative.  So badly that they were willing to approach the other side.  Second, big red pill discussions with my high school daughters. Both have been fairly apolitical, but now are beginning to understand as we‚Äôve had to do reviews for various AP history and economics classes, just how much they have NOT been taught.  And they instinctively get it.  The youngest has now had the experience of being the academic #1 in her private school class + a top athlete, yet kids who are minorities, ranking far below are applying and getting full scholarships at private schools.  That is a sobering discussion to have.

            Well, perhaps there is a valid reason for your few remaining lib‚Äôs to gin up opposition to their leftist majority.  Here, a very minority, blue population seems to care less, and a lot of the pleas for an opposition party candidate seems more to promote the illusion of choice among the voters.  This illusion requires a Washington Generals team be fielded against the Harlem Globe Trotters, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to require that the Generals win any of the games played.  üòâ

                What‚Äôs interesting and I‚Äôve noted it here before, is that the ‚Äúnormie‚Äù Democrats are scared crapless of the Jacobins in their midst.  I‚Äôm a couple districts north of Mini-Maduro down in the Bronx.  The operatives that work for my ‚Äútraditional‚Äù Democrat congress critter are terrified of them too‚Ä¶  We‚Äôre deep in a Thompson-esque ‚Äúwhen the going gets weird, the weird turn pro‚Äù moment.

                    The Starbucks guy is probably sensing this, too.  He says he‚Äôs an ‚Äúindependent‚Äù, but I suspect he wants to capture the Dem nomination, as the Dem normies run screaming from the rest of the field.

                        Schultz has picked a good year to try the ‚Äúthird party‚Äù gambit.
Given the widespread disgust likely to be felt toward both Trump, and whichever huckster emerges from the Democrat field, he has a significant opportunity.

            Where I live certain posts are reserved for Republicans to run as Democrats because the Dems are so crazy their leadership realizes they can‚Äôt leave control in the hands of their base. So some guy runs in the primary as a democrat for sheriff and all the republicans vote in the dem primary, or enough anyway, to overwhelm the crazy dem vote.

        With my kids this weekend, I watched Peter Jackson‚Äôs director‚Äôs cut of The Return of the King (the last of the LOTR trilogy) which was released about 15 years ago. It struck me almost how anachronistic it looks now because the various tribes of men do not have PoCs sprinkled throughout maddeningly as if the diversity fairy was on set demanding appropriate representation.The Rohan looked like they were all related, as did every other group. This includes the forces aligned with Mordor (the bad guys) who had Middle-eastern looking tribes (again all homogeneous) and the others were the same. There is no way that the movie trilogy would be made today without ‚Äúinclusive policies‚Äù from Wakanda or the Subcontinent or Latin America.Hopefully in a decade‚Äôs time we‚Äôll all look back at the current urge to turn every piece of popular culture into a living Colors of Benetton advertisement and laugh. I am still hopeful.

            I saw the recent movie about Mary Queen of Scots. Seems sixteenth-century England and Scotland were crawling with blacks, including the English ambassador to Scotland! WTF? So if a historical reality that lacked negroes has to be larded up with them, you can be sure a fictional one has to have black hero too nowadays.As for LotR itself, I noticed how ‚Äúold-fashioned‚Äù the overall story is, revolving around honor, duty and self-sacrifice. I think there‚Äôs a natural yearning for such virtues in the human soul, but you‚Äôll never see it any modern movie or television show unless it‚Äôs either firmly set in a mythical setting or treated in a sneering urban-hipster fashion. Everything about the modern world is the exaltation of degeneracy and the disparagement of all that is good and beautiful.

                I stopped watching Doctor Who when the doctor and his black companion were in London in the Victorian era and it was half black. And the companion said I wasn‚Äôt expecting so many black people. And the doctor said history has been whitewashed. It‚Äôs disgusting. And the know-nothings that see it believe that that is true.My own sister thinks there were no white people in the Mediterranean 2000 years ago. This is the line I heard growing up. When the brown people were building great civilizations, white people were still in their caves in Europe. I heard that over and over and over again. I‚Äôm 50. This is been going on for a while

                If it hasn‚Äôt happened already ‚Äî most likely in the London theater ‚Äî a production of Romeo and Juliet with black/white star-cross‚Äôd lovers is inevitable. Take that, you leukonormatives!The theater can absorb a certain amount of racial casting against type; it‚Äôs a genre where you automatically accept certain absurd conventions for the sake of voice and acting. We‚Äôve long had black opera singers playing ‚Äúwhite‚Äù characters, and nobody‚Äôs bothered. You don‚Äôt expect to run into Wotan or Manon Lescaut at the CVS, so there‚Äôs no naturalistic ideal for opera.That‚Äôs less true in movies, which by their nature are a pseudo-realistic   form of entertainment. You have to kind of believe what you‚Äôre seeing, even if the plot line is ridiculous or fantastic. The same is true in spades (no pun) for TV commercials. They portray scenes adapted from daily life, and a steady stream of black bankers, research scientists, etc. just set themselves up for mockery. You‚Äôll know the tide has turned, if it does, when the onscreen negrification begins to look like an outdated parody.

                    By now, black/white Romeo and Juliet is old as the hills, to be edgy now you‚Äôd need Juliet to be a White nine-year old and Romeo to be a steer‚Ä¶ Or maybe Romeo is collectively played by an entire gang of middle-aged Pakistani rapists.The new hideous thing I‚Äôm starting to see in the annals of multiracial TV couplings in advertising (not enough to trend yet, but it‚Äôs coming) is White Soyboy male and homely mystery meat female.  The really worrisome one, the death blow that I‚Äôve seen the tip of, is studly White alpha male paired with homely obese Goblina of Color.  The semiotic message is, LOL goyim, the black men took all your women and now all that even the best of you can aspire to is this shit-colored she-thing!The Jews will use this as a covering defense against the charge that all depicted couples are BM/WF.  See that, goyim?  We paired up Bradley Cooper with Jennifer Hudson?  Now quit complaining!Of course all interracial genetic math leads to White extinction since, whether M or F, the basic equation is, White plus non-White equals Non-White.  There is no such thing as a ‚Äúmixed race‚Äù person.  Barack Obama‚Äôs father simply negated and erased his mother‚Äôs line, for good.The marriage of British royalty to Mud Queen was a master-stroke for (((Our Bestest Friends Ever))).  Don‚Äôt tell me there wasn‚Äôt team of nuclear-powered super-yentas working like mad to cobble that one together.  The message was perfect: Even for the richest most powerful White men, the best you get is the leftovers.  It‚Äôs one of the many reasons (((they))) hate Melania Trump so much.  Can‚Äôt have an Alpha White scoring an Ice Queen.

                YOU are GUILTY of the sin of NOTICING! You are not supposed to notice the race of the English ambassador. Well, of course, you ARE supposed to notice because that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs black. But you‚Äôre not supposed to notice because noticing is a sin.

                Hollywood is not our friend, so it behooves us almost to signal boost non-white complaints about ‚Äúappropriation‚Äù. Fewer white actors in Hollywood is a good thing, and if whites are only allowed to practice Eurocentric culture that‚Äôs about as good as it ever gets for us.

            I can easily picture a time very soon where older movies that are deemed ‚Äúproblematic,‚Äù are banned from airing on television or on-demand services.  Someone‚Äôs probably already made a list of those movies that they‚Äôd like to send down the memory hole.  Edit: Of course someone‚Äôs made a list.  I just googled, ‚Äúproblematic movies‚Äù and there‚Äôs a lot of SJW outrage out there.

                Oh, yes. In ‚ÄúDambusters‚Äù, one of the protagonists has a black Labrador called ‚ÄòNigger‚Äô. At one point there a scene where‚Äôs he coolly tells his staff that ‚ÄúNigger got run over by a car. The guy didn‚Äôt even stop‚Äù.

            The LOTR trilogy is universally reviled by SJWs because of that very thing. It is also not hard to see the allusion / allegory in that story with our present situation which is why I recommend playing it on repeat and showing it to anyone and everyone.Hordes of jet black large violent murderous orcs (Uruk-Hai) led by pasty white wizard telling them ‚ÄúMan Bad, orc good‚Äù. Low IQ savage murder machines wound up by big nosed ‚Äúwhite‚Äù wizard.Elves- comically Nordic looking with the extremely fair hair, skin, light colored eyes. Considered the master race old when the world was young, now retreating because they cannot stand to see the world burn under the dusky hordes.Men- The men fighting to save the world are your salt of the earth caucasians to a man. The light brown men from the south decide to join the jet black orcs and devils of Mordor to subjugate the world under them.The One Ring- needs no metaphor. It is Power unadulterated. Which is why it so thoroughly corrupts anyone it touches all but the strongest willed can resist the call to use it to bend other beings to their will.So you have a coalition of the damned. Black orcs, middle eastern dusky men, shifty manipulative wizards and ‚Äòadvisors‚Äô (Grima) who are behind the throne puppeting it all. On the other side, the men, elves, dwarves, and their dwindling sense of good, right, honor, and sacrifice (h/t Saurons Lazy Eye) who seem to be fighting a hopeless battle against a world thoroughly corrupted with amorality and evil. Sound familiar?The question is thusly‚Äì where is our Frodo, our Gandalf, our Aragorn? Because the story doesn‚Äôt end well without their presence‚Ä¶

                ‚Äúuniversally reviled by SJWs‚Äù
Must explain why I‚Äôve always really liked the LTR trilogy.
I really liked it when I read the books as a teenager 40 years ago ‚Äì and when Peter Jackson did the movies they were some of the few that have ever made my ‚Äù I HAVE TO see this‚Äù list.

            And Peter Jackson was suggested to be a racist for this.  (Such as the appearance of the Orcs.)  Don‚Äôt forget that‚Ä¶even though he was bringing the source material to life.I do love the LOTR extended edition.  Once you watch it, if you even still remember the theatrical release, you can‚Äôt go back.  It‚Äôs like a whole other film.A good rule of thumb I use regarding ‚Äúrepresentation‚Äù is that any score on Rotten Tomatoes is 15% higher if the film displays appropriate ‚Äúrepresentation‚Äù.  That‚Äôs why, for example, Wonder Woman gets 93% when it‚Äôs really more of a 78% (and the % of people who liked it is lower than the critical reviews).  It‚Äôs why Star Wars: The Last Jedi, which 2 years later is just awful dreck, got such high scores.  It was all about ‚Äúrepresentation‚Äù.  My kids asked me to take them to the new Spiderman flick (Spiderverse), so I did.  I noted that it is something like 97%.  It‚Äôs also more of an 82%, but it gets +15% for ‚Äúrepresentation‚Äù.  It‚Äôs pretty good, but it‚Äôs not 97% good.  Nor was Zootopia‚Ä¶another 99% movie that was at best a B+ if you take out the ‚Äúrepresentation‚Äù.The backlash against that stuff is coming, and it is coming in a big way for Hollywood.  They are actively pissing people off with constant preaching.  People will stop going to the movies, and many already have.

                    Zootopia is a strange movie.  It tries very hard to present itself as your standard Liberal PC pap.

            Similarly, the whole appeal of Game of Thrones is to give white people a fake history they can immerse themselves in because they‚Äôre not allowed to enjoy their real history.(Also, Daenerys‚Äô storyline is instructive ‚Äî she has a short-lived marriage to a vibrant PoC that‚Äôs pretty rapey but she convinces herself it was real love; she plays her hand at being a white savior for a while but it turns out that MENA will always be a shithole anyway; then finally she returns to her Northwest European homeland to attend to her real duties to her own people that she‚Äôs been putting off, with a few minutes left on her biological clock.)

            Why do you think LOTR was such a smash hit? We tend to forget that before Jackson, stuff featuring dwarves and elves was not normie-friendly, it was strictly nerd territory. Same with GoT and Vikings: nice ethnostates with lots of white people, like those Victorian period series cat ladies love.
The reason BBC wants to poz up British history, is because they dread that historical dramas will become popular due to the inherent whiteness, and thereby awaken an awareness of Europe‚Äôs cultural roots. Never mind the vibrancy, but if Euros re-discover their roots, globohomo will be in dire trouble.

        Full sleeve tattoos can‚Äôt be taken off.  Maybe they can be zapped off over a thousand hours and tens of thousands of dollars.  What people are doing today is like stapling powder blue leisure suits to their bodies, never to be taken off.  Including women.  There‚Äôs no such thing as a tattoo that complements femininity.  In the last couple years I‚Äôve noticed people‚Äôs full sleeve tattoos getting darker and darker, as old tattoos do.  Since this trend started in the oughts, it‚Äôs been 10+ years of this now, and wow is it aging poorly on people.  They‚Äôll be a sad reminder even if society begins mocking tattoos, which is certainly will.

The first generation is full of zeal and insanity. The second generation sees things calm down, as the revolution seeks stability in order to rule. Rot sets in.

That‚Äôs probably what the Catholic Church thought of themselves, when the first typeset press was introduced in Europe.
Of course the nature of technology may see this cycle accelerated.
More like kicking over the chessboard and lunging at the opponent, teeth first.The internet is far more revolutionary than the typeset press, and we‚Äôve only just seen the beginning.

            Arthur, I believe you are basically correct.  I remember distinctly when low pants (waist below belly button and open midsection) became popular.  It was anything, but spontaneous‚Äîunless you define spontaneous as occurring/spreading with rapidity.  Rather, the TV ad space was saturated with pictures of young women/girls walking along wearing these new cut of jeans and the voice over announcer stating that this was the new cool thing all the women were now wearing.  Even stating that if you were not wearing such, you were out of it. Blatant‚Äîand it was obvious to everyone I knew.  Prior to seeing such on TV, I had never seen anyone wearing such on the street.  And I was not in a small town, but rather an large city.  Within a year, everyone was wearing such pants.  Other than fat people wearing such, the result was fine with me‚Äîuntil the ‚Äústyle‚Äù drifted into men‚Äôs wear.  Still plagues me today.

                Any violence by fringe elements of the right will be swiftly put down and be used to convict all of us by consanguinity. The farm murder campaign in South Africa is a direct consequence of a fringe Afrikaner terrorist group in the 1990s.

                    ‚ÄúThe farm murder campaign in South Africa is a direct consequence of a fringe Afrikaner terrorist group in the 1990s.‚Äù
I‚Äôm sure that this didn‚Äôt help, but given the track record of the rest of Africa, persecution of the white minority was only a matter of time. At most, Afrikaner extremism speeded things up a bit.

                        It didn‚Äôt help that the trial went on for 11 years, presumably either due to incompetence or the need to publicly beat a dead horse. Much like the Reconstruction era GOP, the ANC needs the ‚Äúbloody shirt‚Äù to keep winning elections.

        I think that history will not help. All fashion stuff changed when US was 90% white and industrial powerhouse. Of course, revolution and war can be also called a ‚Äúchange‚Äù but this is very gullible hope that current madness with Global Elite and 100 million of POC will just go away like Disco or something. I think this fashion will go away like French revolution or Russian revolution.

        I‚Äôll step up to the plate with the black pill and will assert that for most of us reading this blog the multiculti pc poz will, for all intents and purposes, last forever. Whites in America have a TFR that is below replacment rate and are dying faster than they are reproducing. Meanwhile, the family reunification policy of immigration guarantees that immigration quotas into the US will come from overwhelmingly non-white countries.The white demographic holds a vastly disproportionate amount of assets in the US and is transistioning from a working economic source that generates income and tax revenue to a retired economic sink that sucks assets out of the Social Security and Medicare system. This is inherently unstable. The younger, browner population of Americans is not going to work themselves into the ground to support the lavish retirement of aging, white boomers.AOC and her socialist cohorts are just the tip of the iceberg, or more aptly the pointy end of the spear. Asset confiscation is coming. It will be preceded by the villification of whites as a class to justify the confiscation.

            The thing is (with all respect to Wolfgang Pauli) ‚Äì ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not even wrong.‚Äù But neither are you totally right.What you said is all true, but your own theory invalidates the final hypothesis. The multi-culti CAN‚ÄôT last forever because the model is inherently unsustainable. So my point of contention is this part ‚Äúlast forever‚Äù. It can‚Äôt and will actually burn out rapidly one way or another.So the present trajectory will take a hard turn one way or another. Either the orcs will finally drop all pretense of civility (likely given current events) and start outright stealing retirement / SS / etc. as well as basically writing edicts that criminalize white skin. Reverse Jim Crow and europeans will go quietly into the night. (You alluded to this at the end)ORBacks pushed against the wall with little left to lose Europeans find their collective consciousness / balls again and the thing turns sporty very quickly. This can happen much faster than I think some people anticipate. Single incidents, historically, have sometimes spawned sweeping world events. As the acidity, hatefulness, and outright calls for violence for basically nothing increase the likelihood of this increases as well.The future is not a straight line on our current trajectory and is almost guaranteed to do a hard pivot one way or another.

                I shouldn‚Äôt have to spell this out explicitly, but I guess I do. The phrase ‚Äúfor all intents and purposes‚Äù was meant to convey that the word ‚Äúforever‚Äù means ‚Äúwithin our lifetimes.‚Äù I thought that was pretty evident to any decent reader.Also, I did not refer to the multi-cult model that as unstable. I referred to the situation in which the younger, browner cohort of Americans are working to finance the lavish retirement of an older, whiter cohort of retirees. The politics of AOC sharpen into focus when viewed through that lens.The notion that whites are going to push back is laughable. Whites are soon to be a minority of the population, and an old minority at that. Even within the population pool of whites it is difficult to find majority support for imposing significant limitations on legal immigration, much less an overtly pro-white immigration policy This simply is not going to happen in our lifetimes.

            Black and Hispanic fertility is 1.8 right now.  ,White and Asians fertility at about 1.6 maybe a bit high here or thereThe culture is  so bad no one is having kids and every single group is below replacement . The national TFR is  well below replacement and there is room for it to fall further. I‚Äôve heard speculation of German (1.5) or Polish (1.3) level low being fully possibleThe only groups with significant fertility are the Amish, welfare Somalis and a smattering of very devout Christians and JewsThe headlong rush into automation combined with the POZ basically means there will be as much immigration as can be canned down without a revolt and within a few years, those groups will stop having children, as wellOver time this should shift the culture hard right as the only people left will be religious people who take the faith seriouslyThis may take a lot longer than any of us like but with nearly fifty years of constant below replacement fertility that is as clear a trend as can be hadThe only way this can be reversed and the better parts  of modernity preserved is for a Right Wing authoritarian state  to gain power but that is another scenario entirely

        The thing I‚Äôve never been able to understand about this kind of SJW virtue signaling is the hypocrisy. I mean, rich white parents are usually liberal but they also tend to have have extremely normal values and morals about divorce and education and thrift and (usually) abortion and 99% of them would be devastated if one of their kids decided he was gay and wasn‚Äôt going to procreate. But heaven help us if any of them ever preached the superiority of their own values. This is why I‚Äôve always thought it was just a fad. They say these things and vote this way because it‚Äôs what they think they are SUPPOSED to do, not because they actually believe it.‚ÄúLove is love! Two dudes kidding is beautiful!

                That‚Äôs been frustrating as f@#$ to me is the number of women I know who preach feminism, but their personal life is practically medieval levels of traditionalism (marry masculine man of same background, maintain feminine appearance, no children before marriage,  etc.).

            Yes, Oscar Wilde‚Äôs parents must have been devastated by their lack of grandchildren‚Ä¶not. In fact, he did more to reproduce the White race than, oh, 90%of ‚Äúalt right‚Äù keyboard warriors. In terms of reproduction, Hitler was the homo.

            (Epistemic status: speculative)This was always the weakness of Anonymous Conservative‚Äôs shtick. High-status progressivism advocates r-selected behaviors in the catechisms of its faith, sure, but high-status progressives still adhere to k-selected life scripts in the long term ‚Äî perhaps more now than ever, with assortative mating of the kind Charles Murray describes in Coming Apart.To the extent that these people do flirt with drugs, with slumming it, with living as ‚Äúlesbians until graduation‚Äù, it‚Äôs almost a way of showing off that they can come away from it all with minimal lasting damage. Some people can handle being surrounded by easy access to vice, and some people can‚Äôt. To willingly subject yourself to all that in your youth and still seamlessly transition into a stable career and a life of yoga and bourgy hobbies is a strong fitness signal to your mating prospects that your children will have genetic safeguards against the very degeneracy you champion in your Facebook posts. Some upper-caste Brahmin kids here and there will still fall into a downward spiral to their doom (or at least fail to get the joke while they‚Äôre still fertile), but that‚Äôs just making up for the lack of childhood mortality that historically protected the gene pool.

        Changing clothing fashions is usually harmless, changing fashions in public morality is usually not.  Public morality performed important social functions.  It was there throughout all history in all cultures for a reason.  It remains a fact that there are permanent, real physical and psychic consequences for violating it.  Just ask those killed by the opioid epidemic or living with a permanent STD.To begin with, public morality set up a marker for what kinds misfortunes (always a combination of bad decisions and ‚Äòbad luck‚Äô) you could expect your society to help you with and which not.  It provided a curb on the bad decisions of the those with less intelligence and impulse control.  At the very least it gave cover from peer pressure to fainthearted proles on the bad-decision bubble.It is the natural fallen human inclination to want to privatize pleasures and socialize their costs.  So public morality is always a nuisance to adventurous elite who could afford and avoid the consequences of bad decisions much better than Dirt People.  But it was one of their duties to pretend adherence to public morality, even if hypocritically.  But that‚Äôs all gone now.We have apparently decided to subsidize any and all avoidable ‚Äòbad luck‚Äô with taxpayer funds.  This cannot survive the coming fiscal collapse, any other considerations of morality aside.

            As I predicted, Cernovich and other alt-lite grifters are migrating back toward the left. His recent shilling for Islam is only the beginning. On balance his comments weren‚Äôt wrong though. Our fear-mongering about Islam for 20 years has only once gotten us a reduction in immigration, via the Trump cut in refugee resettlement. Praising Muslims for their family values is a better tactic, it also annoys the secular Zionists. Never use Judeo-Christian, always use Abrahamic.

The volume of polling data indicates that Islam is consistently the most unpopular religion in the US, but this hasn‚Äôt done anything to shut down immigration from their lands. Muslim societies have always had internal mechanisms to contain their fanatics, the rise of jihad in modern times is the fruit of Western and Israeli interventions.

I‚Äôm not the one arguing in bad faith here, I dislike Islam and desire their repatriation. But I must also bow to reality rather than engage in wish fulfillment.

                        My previous answer to you vanished.  Must have stepped on tender toes.   Stating the canonical facts about Islam, what Islam says for itself, is not ‚Äúhatespeech.‚Äù   Sociological explanations for 1400 years of Jihad satisfy those who can‚Äôt take religion seriously as a motivator.  Therefore, in their ‚Äúerudition,‚Äù they posit that nobody takes it seriously.How arrogant of them.  There are several ways of doing Jihad.  By speech, by the pen, by using money as well as violence.  If one heaves a sigh of relief that ‚Äúwe‚Äôve solved the jihad problem‚Äù by curtailing the violent few, the PEACEFUL jihadi continues to operate right under your noses.  You cannot remain smugly ignorant about Islam and think you can effectively curtail creeping Shari‚Äôa.   Cultural marxism loves Islam so much because they both hate the West.   I have no intention of letting them frame the debate.  If you want to get into what motivates the JIhadi you cite your secular sources and I‚Äôll cite canonical Islam.

                    Islam is the knife, but it is a Judaic hand that wields that knife.
The two Abrahamic religions are both Semitic, as Christianity, the merger of Mediterranean and Northern Europa, was solidified by Constantine and Eusebius.
Both Islam and Christianity took 300 years to finalise.We are taught that Islam is the invention of ignorant Bedouin, but they were merely the shaped vessel to gain revenge for the lost kingdom of Israel.  Lost by their own obstinate perfidy, but that doesn‚Äôt matter.

                        alzaebo, whether or not Islam had ‚Äúhelp‚Äù, the conditions on the ground in the ME appeared fertile for a ‚Äúcut and paste‚Äù of Jewish and Christian canon, along with a street gang orientation to religious observance, demonstrations of fealty, and penalties for trying to leave the gang.  Islam may have had (((help))), but I am unwilling to let Islam off the hook that easily.  They have had 1400 years to figure it out, and, by and large, they have stayed with the gang mentality all the way through.

        The Dark Ages may not be a real thing, but there was a long period of time where mass migration destroyed the ability of the Roman State to do anything. The new rulers never stopped pretending they were Roman. Charlemagne was crowned Roman Emperor almost 400 years after the Western Roman Empire collapsed.
In four hundred years, it will be the fashion for howling African tribal chiefs to wear American flag pins in the ruins of Capital Hill.

        One of the aspects of western fashion I have always found fascinating is the rapidity with which it changes. You can go back to ancient Greece and watch the progression among Europeans over the centuries. It‚Äôs quite remarkable. It really began to speed up around the time of the Renaissance. There is nothing like this among other cultures. Their fashion plates are frozen in time for centuries. Not ours. We change our clothing styles and philosophies at a dizzying pace.

            I don‚Äôt know if technology will progress very much in the West, owed to the increased vibrancy, but certainly the multicultural system creates it‚Äôs own demand in a way that Disco did not.
When diversity becomes untenable, demographics will have already made it inescapable. The end goal is likely to make the post-diversity monoculture a re-badge Sunni Islam, as the Sunni fanatics are the tip of the imperial spear in Asia.

                I‚Äôd also add that:  inducing beatings from the political system, is a time honored method of gaining allies.I remember reading something quite a while back about commies turn young college kids to their cause.  They fill the kid‚Äôs heads with all of the usual leftist drivel ‚Äì and then they get them to come to the next protest or rally.At the protest ‚Äì they make sure all the wide eyed youngsters are out in front of the mob.  That way when the riot police show up ‚Äì all those young kids get their heads knocked around ‚Äì and arrested.  Now they‚Äôve got a record ‚Äì and they think ‚Äúthe man‚Äù is their enemy.Congratulations ‚Äì you just gained a convert to your cause.One of the tests of right wing seriousness ‚Äì should be to watch to see if they gain converts by manipulating the left wing psychos into attacking people who aren‚Äôt down with current day leftist lunacy.All of this ‚Äù they want you dead white man‚Äù stuff I see lately ‚Äì is a good start at that.

        Waiting for a anti-white, genocidal movement like multiculturalism to blow over is just sill. It‚Äôs driven by ethnics whose hate for whites is hardwired and it‚Äôs not a trend, i  Blacks never stopped hating whitey after  the CRA or even after they were elevated to a protected class in society.Yes college educated whites promote whites promote it to prove their moral superiority.   But multiculturalism has a life of iit‚Äôs own since ihe population of brownskins is rapidly increasing. and pushing whites into minority status.It won‚Äôt change until whites are either killed off or we fight back.Waiting around like a bunch of schmoos in the hopes we don‚Äôt end up in a cannibals stewpot or a ditch.

        Horny juveniles always want to get laid, and in our modern culture (as in many other species), outrageous appearance can help draw attention, which is what drove the Saturday Night Fever dress habits of the 70s. By the 80s, cocaine became the new lubricant, and no one could afford the ridiculous clothes (plus disco mercifully died). Current social insanity is a function of the death of hardship, and parasitic people have nothing better to do with their time, so they opt for passive/aggressive attacks on others. A return to smash-mouth feedback will put a quick end to that.

After all, in its heterosexual manifestation, it involved men and women getting dressed up in what, at the time, were considered nice clothes, going out to nightclubs (just like in those racist 1940‚Äôs ‚Äì 1950‚Äôs!) and dancing dances that had actual steps, instead of just gyrating around, usually to music that had no social subtext, other than a vague sexual hedonism. I can well remember Lefty movie reviewers at the time growling about ‚ÄúSaturday Night Fever‚Äù for these very reasons, along with the fact that the movie had a view of abortion and racial tensions that were not very liberal at all. The ‚ÄúDisco Sucks!‚Äù movement of 1979-1980 mostly consisted of drunk guys who couldn‚Äôt learn the dance steps and thought that the whole thing was faggy, and fat chicks who couldn‚Äôt fit into the dresses, but there was also a distinct Lefty component to it as well.The late 1970‚Äôs were a really bizarre moment in history, in lots of ways.

            They are already starting the push for pedos as attraction to children they are just ‚Äúborn that way‚Äù like trannies. And as for the toes out abortion, that just passed in NY state. You can abort up to the moment of birth now.So once again, we are behind the far left prog curve. I‚Äôm thinking bestiality and post-term abortion up to 6 months will be next. Don‚Äôt like being a mom? You can still murder the child up to 6 mos later, no regrets. It sounds like absurd parody and fiction until you consider where we are at this very moment. We make Sodom &amp; Gomorrah look like Disneyland, hopefully righteous fire will ensue like last time.

            Wolf, one can hope.  I used to compare our current situation to the history of the Salem Witch Trials.  They got worse and worse and accusations more and more ridiculous that finally the Governor stepped in (to protect the few condemned left unexecuted) and the populous no longer listened to the hysterical girls making such accusations.
However, I‚Äôm still waiting and it seems such nonsense increases in intensity and frequency.  If this is a prelude to a final flare out, it is the longest super nova ever recorded.

                    That‚Äôs for sure.  At the ESPN award show a few years ago, when Jenner received the Most Courageous Award, Brett Favre was in the audience and the camera panned the crowd and caught Favre half-heartedly clapping, and being the first in the audience to stop clapping. The look on Favre‚Äôs face was like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm clapping for an old man in a dress.‚Äù The New York Times scolded Favre for his less-than-enthusiastic behavior the next day.

        Fashion is an interesting cultural artifact.  There is an inherent tension between utility and aesthetics.  I have worn uniforms at several stages of my life.  They can evoke esprit de corps in one moment and stifling conformity in another.  Consider how an SS officer‚Äôs garb can be both more stylish that those of other military outfits and at the same time a symbol of appalling evil.  There do seem to be some deep cycles to fashion.  Ties, or any neckwear, are almost out; while hats and beards are becoming ubiquitous.  And the rules change, too.  Young men never remove their hats or caps upon entering a house or sitting at table.  Their indignation at being told to remove it by the bailiff in a courtroom is palpable.  As Hericlitus  put it, change is the only constant and you cannot step into the same river twice.

        Classical mens‚Äô style is timeless.   The highest ideals, the best material.  Flawlessly executed.  Proportion, balance.  Built to last upon a sound foundation. Fashion may change every seventeen seconds but neither my style nor my principles do.  Trendy for its own sake has never been part of my life.

        Hearing the seattle public morality of adults, and then talking to their kids, it has become clear to me that when the adults are scolding about social justice issues, all the kids hear is Nancy Reagan saying ‚Äújust say no.‚Äù It‚Äôs not that they openly disagree with the parents, it‚Äôs just that they don‚Äôt care at all what religious principles loser adults are spouting, they are doing their own kid thing. I‚Äôve tried to explain this to the adults but they don‚Äôt seem to get it.

            Every generation needs to be ‚Äúsold‚Äù.The problem with truly ‚Äúforceful‚Äù ideologies that never explain why is that the minute you‚Äôre out from under you rebel. Spartans were badasses around other Spartans. On their own, they completely collapsed.Give someone a why and don‚Äôt lie to them. Never ‚Äújust because‚Äù, defend, show the connections between virtuous behavior and the real benefits that accrue. Our ancestors knew virtue needed to be shown to be beautiful, that‚Äôs what all the art and architecture was in aid of. Don‚Äôt lie about virtue either, you can wind up getting it in the neck even if you do everything right. But truth be told, while it‚Äôs not easy, it‚Äôs always easier on you.Don‚Äôt lie about the wages of vice either. The minute they see one kid light a joint and not die, the scaremongering goes out the window as a lie. Vice is bad enough without gilding the lily. You may ‚Äúget away with it‚Äù, for a while, but eventually the game of russian roulette hits a live chamber.

        ‚ÄúThen all of a sudden, the trend reversed and people quickly abandoned those goofy styles and got back to dressing like sane people.‚Äù
True to a large degree but we still have some fashions that will be viewed as hideous in the future.  I hope the current business suit look of short jackets and too short straight-leg pants, with blue cloth against brown shoes, dies a quick and painful death.  I work with a lot of millennials and notice that mom jeans are making a comeback.  ecchhh.  I also can say that capri pants never looked good, and still don‚Äôt.

                Yes, and the shoes are usually that pale dog-doo tan color, scuffed-up lace-ups.  I‚Äôve even seen a sockless look with these. The suit‚Äôs blue color is a medium blue, not a Trumpian navy.  Mostly younger men, under 40, I think wear this ‚Äúlook‚Äù.  I no longer live in an urban area, so I don‚Äôt see commuters on a train going in to work any more.

        Sorry, don‚Äôt agree about the fashion thingee.. I was teener in the fifties. For us guys, we wore straight casual pants. But the trendy got to be what we called ‚Äúdrapes.‚Äù That was dress slacks, or even pants suits, where the knee was wide, narrowing to a narrow cuff. We compared each others slacks to see whose had the most ‚Äúdrape.‚Äù It was fun. Did not hurt a damn soul.Today, I see all girls/ women dressed in stupid looking togs looking like men wore in ancient Britain.. Skin tight from top to bottom-no style at all. And the boys/men? UGH! Wearing sports or beach wear that looks like what once a ladies skirt. Of course that is a deliberate plan to change the guys from toxic masculine displaying physical masculinity to emulate effeminate women.The seventies. I had a beautiful tall blonde lady who dressed with style. And that included not skin tight shit boring pants like today, for EVERYONE THE SAME EXACTLY,  but was slacks that had a marvelous straight cut, or slightly wider at the bottom. What a beauty. You would still be drooling.

            There‚Äôs been too much emphasis here on the clothes fashion of the 70‚Äôs.  I personally thought it was far out cool and daring. The point is, that the spirit of the 70‚Äôs was great.  The music was great.  The women were never sexier.  The tv shows and movies took chances and were more experimental than ever.  I was just a kid, but man, it was such as sweet time.  If we‚Äôre going to pinpoint a time when things actually got bitchy weird, it‚Äôd be around 1997.

                        In my experience, the ‚Äô70‚Äôs were a very odd mix of good and bad. Probably true of any decade, but it was more stark then. It was the decade of hippies but also hard-hat riots, ‚ÄúBilly Jack‚Äù but also ‚ÄúDirty Harry‚Äù, peaceniks and vigilantes, Disco and Punk, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan almost winning the 1976 nomination, psychic spoon bending and Skylab, Soviet Expansionism and Detante. Public policy was a catastrophe then, but there was a lot going on under the surface, and speech was utterly free, for both good and ill. It was both exhilarating and frightening. A very odd time to be alive.

        If you look at an early 90s rock video, the fashion worn there is exactly what teenage suburban boys are still wearing today. Basketball shorts, ill-fitting t-shirts and skate boarding shoes. Hipsters fled to the city where they can escape the beatings but once you get out into shopping mall and family restaurant territory, the only difference with boys between now and 1992 is that they are checking their phones every 14 seconds. That would be like boys from the 90s dressing like the late 60s‚Ä¶.

        Read a really good piece over the weekend about how now that we‚Äôve become ‚Äúpost-Christian‚Äù society is reverting back to pre-Christian paganism: sexual deviancy, euthanasia and abortion, imperialism, bread and circuses. Basically, Judeo-Christianity served as a constraint on our animalistic urges and now that it‚Äôs gone we are simply reverting back to our natural selves, even when the consensus thinks we‚Äôre ‚Äúevolving‚Äù towards the ‚Äúright side of history‚Äù.And the irony is that a lot what passes for morality these days is based on a very dumbed down concept of Christianity: ‚ÄúBe nice to everyone no matter what. Only mean people judge others.‚Äù

            No, the new morality is, ‚ÄúBe nice to everyone, no matter what, except those who you disagree with in any way, shape, or form, and hound them and unperson them, and destroy them any way you can.

            Judeo urges are materialistic, destructive, animalistic, and sociopathic when it comes to anyone outside of the tribe. Christianity promotes love, responsibility, industriousness, tolerance. There is no such thing as ‚ÄúJudeo-Christian.‚Äù Christians follow Christ. Jews are of the Pharisees, the original separatists, with their sick Talmud.

            ‚Äújudeo-christianity‚Äù is a phrase that would have had no meaning to any Christian minister 100 years ago.It did not exist to all intents and purposes and became widely promoted during and since the attempt to achieve the  vomiting of the state of Israel on the people of Palestine in an attempt to graft their barbaric religion into the Greco-Roman origins of the Wests civilization.

        There is a great book by chuck klosterman ‚Äòbut what if we are wrong‚Äô on this topic.
It is more general of course but takes the same view that social norms or cultural figures that are deemed significant now will likely change through the ages.
One particular nugget was that Melville wasnt regarded as the ‚Äògreat american novelist‚Äô at all, only 50 years after his death was he regarded as such, while more successful and celebrated contempories have been forgotten.

        ‚ÄúMost likely, some famous person was talked into wearing a velour track suit on television and all of a sudden everyone had to have one.‚ÄùI believe the TV show you are trying to remember is ‚ÄúThree‚Äôs Company‚Äù.  (Another of many that could really never air today with the same characters.)Fashion is economics.  Fashions change when the revenues decline‚Ä¶people get all stocked up on blue suits that last a long time‚Ä¶so to sell more suits the styles must change.  The 70‚Äôs were like a great reset button on 20th Century fashion.  In the 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs (and a bit of the 00‚Äôs) your basic black suit, red/blue tie, wingtips, etc. came back into vogue ‚Äì minus the hats.  That has since run its course for now, and to some extent the skinny-wear of the 80‚Äôs is back, albiet in less 80‚Äôs colors.  I don‚Äôt think we ever go back to the 70‚Äôs because those are just ugly versions of the suits that are currently not so much in style.The 00‚Äôs will be remembered as Casual Friday fashion.  Jeans at work.  A sportcoat‚Ä¶with jeans.  Maybe you tuck your shirt in, maybe you don‚Äôt.  Yeah the brown shoes with the blue jeans is odd, but the brown leather wingtips are a mighty fine looking shoe with the patina they get.  Thank Gen-Xers like me for casual Friday fashion going all week long now.  I still have my grey/black suits, white shirts and ties though.  Toxic masculinity be damned.  Sometimes you just want to look damn fine.  But the general trend today is ‚Äúcasual‚Ä¶that matches‚Äù‚Ä¶and the rise of mail-order fashion boxes.   You can be casual without dressing like you picked your clothes off the rack at Goodwill while blindfolded.A lot of companies have a ‚Äúdress your day‚Äù type of policy.  No client/customer meetings?  Just in the cubicle/office on the computer all day?  Jeans and a tshirt.  Meeting the CEO?  Wear what the CEO is wearing.  That makes a lot more sense to me.I think the trend will be back towards suits and ties at some point, and people will generally start shaving again.  The duckbeards are hopelessly ridiculous.  A guy with a Ross Geller haircut and a 6‚Ä≥ grey beard just looks like a moron.  It‚Äôs like somebody thought ‚ÄúHey, that Civil War general had the right idea, but just from the ears down.‚Äù  I have a friend I tease him he looks like Joshua Chamberlain at Gettysburg.The duck beard thing for sure is one people will look back on and laugh about unless they live south of a certain latitude where such things are more normal.

            I had to look on Google Images to see what a duck beard is. Ewww. Not many people in my ‚Äòhood go for this, but among those who do I particularly detest the grotesque full beard/shaven skull look. It‚Äôs like one of those novelty drawings you turn upside down to see the hidden face.

                Maybe you didn‚Äôt understand my point:Derbyshire considers both, the victims of Jewish overrepresentation in US media and the victims of Jewish Bolshevik terror ‚Äúfools‚Äù, because they let themselves dominate by such a minority. Read his ‚ÄúThe Marx of the Anti-Semites‚Äù.I am just astonished that he could reach the heights of Zman‚Äôs admiration.And wonder why this astonishment makes me an agent‚Ä¶

                    The problem with antisemitism is it easily turns into a cult for many people. You either subscribe to every article of faith among the antisemites or you are the sworn enemy of the antisemites.
I prefer to think for myself and prefer others who do the same, even if they get some things wrong now and then.

                        That‚Äôs true. But if JD is so scared ‚Äúto get the Jew thing‚Äù as he apparently is, an honest attitude would have been to stay out of that minefield. Instead he jumps into the fray and attacks Kevin McDonald with incoherent arguments of the kind cited, loosing intellectual credibility.
