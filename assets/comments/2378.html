        Going topless is passé.  Showing the cheeks of your pert (or not so pert) derriere is all the rage these days. The tinier the thong and the bigger the booty the better. And women say—with a straight face—that men objectify them!  Thank you Brazil, thank you Kim Kardashian, thank you A-A hip hop music, thank you all you feminists for liberating those nubile young teen-age girls and matronly ladies who dare to flash their ass.
