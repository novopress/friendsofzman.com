        Apparently gender confusion is not confined just to the young, re: Bruce Jenner. I am so horrified by this whole drama. He was such a sports hero back in the day! And now he’s a she.

        Irrational or not, I think you miscalculate the determination of the gays to force our sloppy politicians to grant male/male or female/female pairings all sorts of laws and powers. That means  they can get a child and declare it ‘all theirs’ as if it was born to a heterosexual couple.But I also go with Bud here: people are people and while this fact alone drive the Left nuts, the reality is people will do what people always have done and once out of the searchlight aimed by the ‘overseers’ they quietly return to what may be considered normal behaviour. It may take time and few missteps along the way, but the basic human condition always asserts itself eventually.

        Don’t lose hope for the race.I have a friend whose daughter, deflowered at 16 by a 17 year old boyfriend (both a poor lover and selfish prick) who bailed after a couple of months.At that point, she declared herself a lesbian, and went through 3 female lovers over the next 5 years. Each affair was filled with drama, and each breakup was spectacular. After the third, I think she finally figured out that assholedness was not confined to the male of the species, and she started dating men. She found a good one.She’s been married for 3 years now with 2 cute kids.
