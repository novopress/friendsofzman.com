        “The point is not to sway or trick a skeptical public, but to enforce conformity of opinion inside Washington”
I think this is directed outside DC too. Mimesis is a feature of any aristocracy. All the agitprop is directed at letting the provincials know what opinions are officially sanctioned in the Imperial Capital so they can be aped in salons across America.
Everyone here has experienced cocktail conversations with normies who parrot Regime talking points. Challenging them either makes heads explode or assures a lonely cocktail hour as you’re marked as a dangerous dissident with unapproved opinions.

            Yeah I’m going to one of those parties tonight, will be quite a few AWFL’s and their defeated husbands there.  I’m looking forward to telling people I don’t give a pigs ass about Israel, Gaza, The Ukraine, trannys…I won’t bring these topics up, its the opening night of the town carnival but if asked I’ll be honest.  Life’s too short.

                    Specifying restrictions on poisoning or mutilating minors gives away the store, BECAUSE – if it is really possible to be “born in the wrong body”, then it follows that restricting corrective action in minors is doing them an injustice.
This is one practice that must be opposed 100% of the time, because making exceptions admits the possibility that the whole mental illness has some validity – that 2+2 sometimes can equal 3, or 5, as O’Brien would have it.

                The role of the public is to implement and carry out and conform to the policies, so they are told what they are. TPTB sets the policies. There is no public input in deciding and formulating public policy at this stage, but it requires the public to be aware of what they are and to carry them out. The propaganda for the public is a to-do list. Captain is right here.

                            The two aren’t mutually exclusive. It took me a long time to accept, but the Help and Ho’s of the Ruling Class, and maybe the Ruling Class itself, were terrified over J6, which in fact was partially engineered by the State. I’ve thought for a long time that if the “Right,” for want of a term, ever reciprocates with violence, the Regime will curl into a fetal position and cry immediately. The problem is history is replete with such a counterpunch never being thrown and the ones who could have stopped it easily failing to do so. We are seeing that unfold.

                                You might be right. I can’t get my brain to wherever it is the DC brains are. They might have been truly terrified, but I don’t know, it could have been acting.
The revelation of the Pelosi documentary and what we now know about all the GIagents provocateurin the crowd puts a big question mark on the whole narrative. To me, anyway.

                                And terrified for no good reason. You’d think Tiglath-Pileser’s hosts were descending upon DC rather than a load of selfie-taking fatties in goofy costumes. I wonder how they would have responded to a real insurrection–you know, one with actual violence, maybe a few gun shots from the interlopers, and a burning building or two.

                I think that they still care about managing public opinion because, although conservatives are effectively repressed, the activist left can still obstruct some of their plans.  The Gaza protests are a good example.
I expect to see the day when they don’t even have to pretend to care about public opinion at all anymore.

                    Public “approval” is important to the regime because a) they’re insecure and b) it confirms their goodness.  Look what happens when the public rejects received wisdom, ie Trump over Clinton and Brexit.  The regime flips out, and their adherents get the signal to also flip out.

                Because totalitarian regimes (and we are, no doubt, neck deep in one now) are absolutely obsessed with public opinion, for reasons stemming from simple narcissism -to be worshiped as the Dear Leader or part of the New Elite, to validate the rightness of themselves and their policies and actions. They just don’t want to be feared and obeyed. They want to be loved and adored, and if it takes the Secret Police to make their “citizens” love them through repression, that’s also part of the fun.

                        Kinda like that. All explained in Orwell’s magnum opus. Because obedience by itself can be reluctant, grudging, half-hearted, and ready to turn into disobedience. And this obedience at the point of a gun can be expensive to elicit. But none of this if the helots  love their oppressor, their  tyrant. They have then internalised obedience and are incapable of ‘thought crime.’ That’s why Orwell’s Oceania has ‘thought police’ — because independent thought is the precursor, the sine qua non, of independent and radical action.

                Absolutely. The amount of trivial and distracting ‘news’ in media space is staggering. It’s literally impossible to build a coherent worldview on the basis of such. Plus it develops the inability to concentrate on anything for any length of time — call it ADHD if you wish.

            Agreed. While “serious” media is directed at insiders, low-brow media (Morning Joe, The View, Fox News, Daily Wire) exists to ensure that the masses internalize The Narrative. Not that the elites give a flying farq about public opinion when it comes to making policy (obviously), but managing AINO is easier if the cattle don’t raise a ruckus. The best form of censorship is encouraging self-censorship.It’s a little different with rightwing media.  Their mission is to (a) divert dissent down harmless dead-ends that lets normie blow off steam impotently. And (b) exploit normie’s patriotism so he’ll get rah-rah over the latest neocon adventure.  Like when the 27-year-old Fox News blonde “writes” the umpteenth book glorifying an all-black unit that liberated a Nazi death camp.

                        In BNW, the proles actually got something — a soma ration, easy work, casual sex with no consequences, and the ‘feelies.’ And this was available regardless of whether you were an Alpha or an Epsilon. In 1984 life is hard and getting harder, and mindless fanaticism is all that makes life tolerable.

                            It seems like the current plan is to offer everyone a choice of things drawn from both BNW and 1984. From BNW we have the choice of legal super-weed, porn and casual sex (though fewer and fewer people actually look like anyone would want to f00k them. From 1984 we get mindless fanaticism (TDS, Covidism, anti-White pogroms). If some of the globalists get their way with pushing bugs-as-food we will also have reduced or just plain disgusting food choices that will be very 1984-ish.

            They think I’m a kook and I have fun with it and keep playing it up just to get their reactions. That’s okay. Just like with Ukraine, I will be proven right again in the end.Interestingly, my cousin’s husband, former Marine (through the ROTC) and I were talking about this stuff. I gave him my line about how we may be under some sort of a military government right now expecting him to groan, but he actually said it wasn’t that outlandish.(Think about two things that happened. 1) Obama being forced to exit the airplane in China through the rear. The Chinese wouldn’t do that on their own. Somebody told them to shame Zero; 2) I think most people here know the talk about DARPA being responsible for Google and Facebook. In other words, it was a project of the alphabet agencies. Who forced Google to change their name to Alphabet in 2015? The weirdness fits in with everything else that has happened since 2016.)

            The point is not to sway or trick a skeptical public, but to enforce conformity of opinion inside WashingtonWhat’s encouraging is that we are finally starting to rectify an existentially horrifying categorical error which we [ostensible patriots] had been making, back circa the three decades of the Rush Limbaugh era.For years upon years upon years, Rush was very fond of talking about how the Democrat Party was sending the marching orders to the media, and how the media was dutifully parroting whatever line it was that the Democrat Party needed to have parroted at any particular point in time.[ Democrats &gt;&gt;&gt; Media ]But the truth of the matter was that it had always been the MEDIA [to include the various behavioral psychologists of the Frankfurt School and the Council of the Sanhedrin] which sat at the very pinnacle of the sociological structure, creating the mesmerization &amp; hypnotization aspects of the various psychological warfare campaigns du jour, and ordering the Democrat Party what to do with each new set of Psy-Ops.[ Behavioral Psychologists &gt;&gt;&gt; Media&gt;&gt;&gt; Democrat Party ]Accidentally inverting your understanding of the true power structure of your enemy is one of the worst mistakes anyone can possibly make in a war.Heck, let’s be quite honest with ourselves; until relatively recently, most of us didn’t even realize that we were in not just a war, but an existential meta-darwinian crisis concerning our very survival.And, to his credit, towards the very end of his life, Rush Limbaugh started wondering aloud, on the air, about the people who actually do run the affairs of Washington DC, and Rush confessed that he didn’t know who they were.So even as he was dying of cancer, Rush was smart enough to realize that his three-decade-old conception of the DC power structure [Democrat Party &gt;&gt;&gt; Media] had internal inconsistencies which were simply irreconcilable.

        So-called “democracy” is simply an oligarchy which owns the propaganda apparatus to manage public opinion. As Anglin writes, “in a democracy there is no one to petition for grievances.”  The conservatives have always been toothless losers, nipping at the heels of liberals as Robert Lewis Dabney, chief of staff to Stonewall Jackson,famously said.What we are seeing is a transition of globohomo from a soft power model of rule to a hard power model of rule, which is more costly to our elites but necessary given the way information flows on the internet.  They can’t keep their fake narratives going without hard coercion.  And it will get much worse as globohomo unleashes upcoming programmable CBDCs and social credit scores to force population behavioral changes.One should note theethnic changing of the guard of our elites.  Before attaining dominance in the United States, most American Jews emphasized freedom of speech, tolerance, plurality, and individual rights, as they did through much of the 20th century, even going as far as theACLU defending the KKKin court to demonstrate their commitment to individual rights. After attaining total dominance in the early 21st century, as we are currently seeing, theyabout-faced and demanded censorship, total control, and promoted vicious anti-white, anti-Christian group-based hatred. Flexibility is key, and whatever is useful at any given time, irrespective of any previously stated values or positions, will be used to further power accumulation. Howard Stern is a good example of this concept, riding a wave of anti-establishment free speech in his early career to wealth and fame and then, once established, turned around and becameextremely and viciously anti-populist(i.e. “pulling the ladder up”). Frank Herbert wrote of this principle. “When I am weaker than you, I ask you for freedom because that is according to your principles; when I am stronger than you, I take away your freedom because that is according to my principles.”

            I believe a fundamental vulnerability of whites is gullibility relative to other races.  This is probably a result of evolving in environments where high trust was adaptive.The Herbert quote you mention:“When I am weaker than you, I ask you for freedom because that is according to your principles; when I am stronger than you, I take away your freedom because that is according to my principles.”is a perfect example of the trick that whites fall for over and over.The depth of this trait is shown in that whites never learn to recognize when their principles are not being reciprocated.

        The thought bubble surrounds DC and adjacent areas so effectively that no one can even notice actual problems or propose anything that might resolve them effectively…Head Start was the idea of a Yale professor, but by 1974 he concluded it didn’t work, and was basically baby sitting..Nevertheless, Head Start continued to grow larger every year since…As counsel for our local Head Start, it became mainly about a food fight, and occasional brawl, between blacks and hispanics for the jobs and food involved…But the appropriation is never cut..

        As Robert Dahl pointed out, one necessary condition of functioning democracy is the ability of the people to set the agenda. After all, before we can decide what to do about the important issues of the day, we must first decide what the important issues of the day actually are. Outside of the Acela Corridor, and its attendant Twittersphere, does anyone actually care about Ukraine? Or Gaza? I think I might have gone the entire year of 2006 without ever once wondering what transgenders are up to, and I seemed to get along fine, but someone decided this was one of the most important issues in the world, that everyone has to think about constantly. As ZMan has asked many times: “Says who?”Increasingly, the Acela Corridor turns into a Versailles, a Forbidden City, a Winter Palace, where those inside and those outside have no idea what issues the other is concerned about, much less what to do about them. How did that work out for those on the inside?

        The media was always crooked, but now, it’s not even a factor. Who reads the WaPo or NYT. Who watches regular news? Boomers, I suppose.The media is now like an inhouse newsletter for a company or a college station. The people in the company or school might watch to see who’s up or down, but no one else cares.This is a good sign. The managerial class and the rest of the world are moving apart. You can see it in how the doxxing is no longer effective. Calling someone a racist is now laughed at. The cultures and values are moving apart. This is good.

                    Yes, but the WaPo is owned by the richest man in the world, and I doubt that it was purchased by him to make money. So a better way to judge whether it “is good for us” might be in loss of readership/influence, rather than just revenue.

            Ironically, in Regime-speak, “the news”, is also for the bugwomen to use to confirm their, “confirmation bias”, and to do their, “fact-checking.”That is in fact how they use it. It is an inner hive signaling mechanism so they can understand the priority of the day. It also signals the outer-hive and allows them to confirm and re-affirm the moral code and the, “facts”, that support it. Of course, that outer hive is college educated but totally incapable of seeing that there are no facts in those reports – only opinion and often emotionally and cognitively manipulative statements. It is transparent to people who end up on sites like this, but bought hook line and sinker by the college educated drone class.

            It’s examples like the one you cite that caused me to conclude, sadly, that the ability to think independently is quite rare, even among smart people.Our leaders are openly “Israel first” while decrying the relatively minor influences that Russia or China may have.  They demand that Israel remain an ethnostate while anathematizing any white gathering.The fact that most people, even very smart ones, don’t even perceive the inconsistency is still striking to me.My favorite example is, during the height of the c0vi1d hysteria, when most liberals said that people who wouldn’t wear masks should have their lives ruined, the BLM protesters were burning down cities without masks on.  Few people even noticedthis glaring inconsistencyand fewer mentioned it at all.If most people, even smart ones, have their beliefs dictated to them by authority, then we should be that authority.

        “…people inside them lack the perspective and self-awareness to see themselves as being in a cult. No one ever says “I decided to join a cult” because no one in a cult thinks they are in a cult.”Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it.At the end of 2020 (after the Biden coup and in the hight of my blue-stage Covidian tyranny) I joined a cult.  In blatant violation of recommended mandatory guidelines, members gathered in large groups, refused to wear ceremonial face coverings and took communion on the tongue.  Most adult, male, members carried firearms and all of their sons carried knives (including all of the altar servers).When the jabs were mandated, the municipal workers who attended attempted to get waivers and then either lied, retired, sued or lost their jobs.  Out of hundreds of parishioners, only one father of five took the jab, in order to keep his suburban government job.  None of the priests/ brothers took the jab, despite being “required” by the archbishop.Like many who read Mr. Z-Man’s missives and comment here, I am a bit of a misanthrope and do not blindly follow orders.  Belonging to a group, however, is essential for human flourishing.

                    Could be. So, which has larger numbers? AINO’s power structure or the dissident sphere? Of course, I suppose both could be cults, if one goes strictly by the numbers.

        I am going to white pill here. It’s not all bad. “The Cult” hates Trump, but there are a lot of R-congresspeople (including my huge cuck of a congressman) lining up with him and going to the podium for him.Then there’s people like JD Vance, Thomas Massie, and Matt Gaetz, who appear to have a clue. And they are the symptom of a larger, underground movement of New Right people. I know these are just a handful of congressmen, but it’s a start, and it shows that not all of Washington is stuffed affirmation-seeking retards.But I suppose we can hope it all gets burned down, which is cathartic. But there is a sea-change in attitudes I’m seeing here and there, green shoots appearing here and there. Maybe there’s still a chance to right the ship. We’ll never get /ourguys/ in congress but I’ll settle for JD Vance leading our Republic if it means I don’t have to fight alongside the Proud Boys in a civil war.

            It is doubtful that the system is salvageable by any means, let alone politically, but I do find Gaetz fascinating. The police state apparatus pulled out all stops to destroy him and force him out of Congress and failed. Maybe he struck a deal–it wouldn’t surprise me, but if not that means something. What, I don’t know, but it is a green shoot.

                Yeah who knows what happened. I imagine anyone who is identified as principled in some way gets a talking-to by strange men in suits.
I like to think that there is a counter-elite forming up which has support by some rich men or big influencers, enough that Gaetz can’t be squashed like a bug and Massie can openly question the FBI. Or there are more people in Washington that have a conscience than we think. Who knows.

        The emergence of “conspiracy theory” to describe anything that runs counter to the official narrative is the tell. Some claim the Soviet Union was unable to survive the rudimentary internet and the information that became widely available to some of its people despite years of broadcast jamming. I don’t know whether that’s really true, but the concept certainly is.Westerners in general and Americans in particular are the most propagandized people on earth precisely because there are so many outlets available to provide official information labeled as “news” or “entertainment” or whatever. Now that outside outlets provide actual information or dissent regardless of accuracy, it is problematic for TPTB. That’s not to say the current Chinese or former Soviets did not try, but total immersion in a sea of noise is not or was not as pervasive in their societies. The cliche of propaganda blasting from a North Korean loudspeaker pales in comparison to the cacophony of noise and images bombarding Westerners…so when you get outside of the Managerial Class, the others who believe the propaganda fall into two camps: those who want to do so, and those who are unaware/ignorant. The former always will be a permanent feature, the latter is where alternative unofficial information presents as a problem in the long run.Someone, I think maybe Sev at his site, once wrote that the purpose of Western media is to update the firmware of the NPC’s. Z today wrote that it is to update the firmware of the Managerial Class. Both are accurate, but the primary purpose is to reiterate/update the official narrative, which even if contradictory to yesterday’s official narrative is the only one that matters (the prophetic powers of Orwell win again!).And as commenters here like Citizen and others elsewhere frequently remind us, the dollars remains the standard and its replacement is in the distance, how far, YMMV. So we may experience the collapse of a system even with relatively strong economy due to a proliferation of truthful information that cannot be suppressed despite furious attempts to do so. I’ve always thought economic collapse would be the precursor to systemic change, but that may not be true and my own firmware may need updating. I still tend to think that’s true but the daily information, official propaganda and otherwise, indicates it is not necessarily so.

        The media does a pretty good job of setting the agenda.  You’ll see a certain phrase show up in the media and then all of the sudden everyone is using that same phrase.  “Keeve” is a great example of this.  One day the capital of Ukraine was known as Kiev. But then the message got, the capital of Ukraine is now pronounced “Keeve” and everyone got the message inside of a day.They not only decide what the terminology will be, but what is talked about and what is ignored.  This trickles down as well.  It’s not just the big guys.  It goes all the way down to bloggers, “influencers” and the annoying progressive old hag in your office.

                The Keeve Conformity is illustrative, but the real brainwashing propaganda there was the idea that the Ukrainian pronunciation of Kiev was distinct from the Russian. Except in heavily accented marginal cases, the difference was inaudible. Now it exists—andit always has. We knew there was no difference. Now we don’t know that anymore.

            That’s a great example. But it’s not just the pronunciation, it’s also the spelling. I got my doctorate in Rooskii history in 2005 and all of us Russian history slobs, from the God-like panjandrum in the Harvard History Department to the lowliest first-semester grad student at Yazoo A&amp;M spelled Kiev, well, Kiev. But, oh no. Turns out we were all oh so wrong. Proper spelling all this time was really Kyiv.

                My general perception in life is that small minds dwell over insignificant distinctions.  So in your example, only a “midwit” would quibble about spelling Kiev, as Keev, or Kyiv—when at point we all agree—and understand—we are discussing the same thing, the capital of Ukraine.  Why is this done?  Because the low level intellect has nothing of importance to relate on the topic at hand and it makes him think he’s “smarter” than you with such a comment.I usually let one of these quibbles by in polite discussion, but then react quite savagely upon the next one.  This usually ends the discussion quickly if nothing else, and that’s fine with me.  I really have little spare time to spend with these individuals and certainly nothing to learn from them.

            Language is important.  That’s why I always say and write “The Ukraine” which was also universally used before this latest great derangement.  My understanding is that parallels the Russian term, in English  “The Borderlands”.  But then I might have been the only person cheering Putin on as he gave Tucker Carlson that backgrounder covering 800+ years of history.  Just because America is a silly country doesn’t mean that real nations don’t have old but vital origin stories.

                Right. I do the same. And one reason is because “The Border” is a name for a territory, not a true nation. And that accurately describes The Ukraine for the vast majority of its history.

            The Keeve nonsense actually offers an insight into how the regime thinks. They clearly believe in using Pavlovian “patterning” to control people. The idea is to create a recognizable trigger which is supposed to give the target person a signal to shut off his brain and accept whatever garbage follows. This process was famously illustrated in the movie The Manchurian Candidate. In the film the trigger was a sequence of playing cards so it can really be almost anything. Of course, people like me heard “Keeeeeve” and were instantly antagonistic to whatever narrative followed.

He dared say it.in doing so he accomplished something more important than his proposed policy initiatives.He forced the ruling class, the media and the alphabet agencies to drop all pretense and fully expose themselves and the game.

        The “deep state” is in full control of DC, as it was designed.  Elected politicians are few in number (537 out of like 2 million plus) and come and go, while bureaucrats, agents, aides and lobbyists and the like spend entire careers in any one of the numerous agencies and bureaus of the federal government and the NGOs and lobbying groups.  They are designed to not change.  Things not changing is “stability” and “predictability.”I would think the people just below the appointed people in the bureaucracies are the real people in charge.  The new president can appoint whoever he wants to be the nominal head of the EPA, but inside the EPA, nothing ever changes other than getting larger and more complex and with more rules for the rubes.

        Inertia and the manufacturing of ‘consent’ for lack of a better term.
Most normies never question the nature of their reality; especially if there’s 24/7, all encompassing messaging bombarding them. It’s the repetition method of brainwashing to constantly hyper focus on the pre-chosen path.
So, offer a thesis and an anti-thesis that have the same outcome and you have the straight line of policy from the end of the cold war.
Left wing pressure for hate speech laws peter out, so we’ll use right wing pressure for hate speech laws. Drumroll please; now the toehold is secure for antisemitism laws…

        Much agree. The parallel culture and economy of the ruling class are speaking to themselves. The speech outside that culture is as incomprehensible to them as speaking Swahili to an English bulldog.
Said speech is religious speech. Like Islam, the culture is racially diverse.  Like Islam, largely illiterate, conducting themselves by rote.
The axioms, mores, and values contained in the religious speech that the ruling class and their media clergy use make no sense to us barbarians. Accuracy is important to a carpenter, but not to a community organizer.

        In current year AINO I continue to be struck by how easily and efficiently, in ordinary conversation, on any of a very broad array of topics, it has become so automatic and unavoidable for anyone and everyone to signal their status with respect to the regime. Ingroup or outgroup, cloud or dirt, boomercon or DR, wokerati or sane person, wannabe cloud or ignoramus (some overlap there). It’s as if the conversational template has been laid down for us and all we have to do is check the boxes to show our allegiance.And there’s no avoiding it. Even by refusing to give an opinion, you still check a box and signal your status. Like the guy who doesn’t applaud for dear leader. That’s everywhere now, not just in the parliamentary chamber of the Supreme Soviet.

        This is a fine explanation of the psychology of the Managerial State: it really is a cult. Most cults do not last, nor do they end well. Arguing with a madman who is waving a pistol around is never a good idea. So don’t do it.

        I think most of the world looks at the Western elites, with the US as its head, and view all as similar to orderlies in insane asylum dealing with a very large, strong lunatic who can just pop off at any time. You don’t know what they’re going to do, they’re really crazy and they’re super strong and you need a bunch of orderlies to take this guy down! But you know without doubt that you might be bruised and battered but you’re going to win because you have to.

                    But both Russia and China have decent relations with that certain entity.  For crying out loud Putin has been moaning about Nazis for 2 plus years (although Nazi has a different meaning in Russia) and claimed in the Tucker interview that he called Zelensky and asked him why he’s supporting Nazis even as a Jew.  Something about his father being a good anti-Nazi.Both have not claimed Iran to be enemy number 1 in the Middle East and have partnered with Iran, but both have normal relationships with Israel.  Hamas has been caught with a lot of made in China weapons, but this is just China being China. It’s not that they are ideologically joined with Hamas, it’s that the criminal class in China is huge.  The same types of people sending weapons to Hamas are sending fentanyl precursors to Mexico to flood over the US border and nitazenes to the UK.
