        I’m continually surprised at people who have rejected the propaganda on covid, the 2020 election, and all the other stuff – but completely buy into Israel being the victim while they Pearl Harbor a country they aren’t at war with.  The zionist propaganda is second to none.

            Very nauseating  when Trump directly lies and says we were not involved in the attack.   They had our satellite data and at least mid air refueling  to make the attack.
Of course he lied to Putin as well when he said we were not involved in the attack on Russia’s strategic bomber fleet.
So much for the peace president.

                        From the start, I never believed his concern with illegal immigration was genuine–I mean, just look at the demographics of the typical hotel housekeeping staff. All he had to do to make that issue a winner for him was talk the talk, because no one else was doing even that much.

            Who bombed Syria? IsraelWho bombed Lebanon? IsraelWho bombed Palestine? Israel
Who is the greatest threat to the region? IRAN
Netty is painting himself as the liberator of Iran. That I kind of like, they want to make Persia the Ukraine of the Mideast. A pirate den and a Belt Road gateway. Smart move, actually. Logical, if you’re a gangster, and fk the mullahs.  This is imperial colonization, updated.
(p.s.- those precision bombing coordinates came from the US base in Baghdad, but we had nothing to do with the targeting.)

            Israel and Iran have been at war since 1979. There was just no formal declaration. That is a 19th/20th Century conceit. Iran aims to destroy Israel as part of its desire to recreate the Persian Empire in Islamic Form. Iran is an expansionist power, as is Turkey also which seeks to recreate the Ottoman Empire.For its part Israel seeks to overthrow the regime or otherwise destroy it and create a large-ish buffer increase and sympathetic buffer states, understandable from their point of view given their thin territory and experience in 1974. It is also expansionist but more limited due to limited manpower and no appeal of Judaism in a Muslim region.There is no “deal” to be made here. Iran will never stop trying to recreate the Persian Empire as that is the moral basis for their regime. Jihad is the foundation on which the mullahs base their legitimacy. Israel will never stop trying to destroy what they view is the most dangerous of their enemies.Is this America’s fight? Maybe not, or maybe yes. It depends on what we can get out of it, what the fight would be like (hybrid war with missiles, close in sabeteur drone attacks making the case for mass deportations) or mass casualty inducing mass assaults like the Gulf War but with a competent, dug in opponent?I am not sure that Iran does not indeed already have some nukes. Neither Israel nor the US can be sure. Which likely makes a “limited” hybrid war on both sides more likely.Finally, assuming war is hybrid not total industrial, the presence of Jews as potentially big Republican donors and organizers is important. Yes, most ordinary Jews being mid-level managers will vote hard left Dem; but Jews with lots of money and organizational skill are like Tank Divisions and Close Air support in WWII. Not the main force but decisive in political outcomes.

                Huh. No idea why the downvotes. As if people have never heard of the muslim yearning for a global caliphate.
Maybe it was just the suggestion that the ME might be an American interest? Not that I think it is, or at least an essential interest, but still…

                Hey f#cktard, Iran hasn’t invaded a country in 400 years. America has, and has killed 20,000,000 since 1945. And if you want to talk about morality, America is a nation full of whores, and Iran kills theirs. And your precious Jews have every pedophile American politician in their pocket. We will never know nothing of the details of the Epstein Files, so that tells you where Trump is on that. All you got to do is see if there’s a pic of any leader wearing The Little Black Cap kissing the Wailing Wall, and that tells you if Israel owns them or not.

        It’s pretty easy to predict what will spell our doom: debt and demographics. White women march in the streets for the right to kill unborn babies rather than reproduce the white race. The white birthrate is below replacement level in every Western nation.The U.S. is also $37 trillion in debt. To put that in perspective, the national debt was only $5 trillion in 2000. Even a Trump administration and a Republican Congress cannot avoid adding trillions to the debt, DOGE notwithstanding.The aging and feminized population will demand a high level of government services and the maintenance of a high standard of living in the face of this debt.It’s simply unsustainable.

            Millennial childless women will put the finishing touches on the US. They have already begun, in that they occupy so many political positions and executive positions now (mayor of Boston, for example), but as they age, they will simply take what they want from the cash drawer of government out of spite and anger at life. No children, no real reason for them to care about the future by their nature…

                        Near where I live there’s a local airport and for years there have been lots of these young Chinese men in the area who are supposedly studying at the local flight schools to become pilots. They seem to live together in groups and will be seen shopping in groups at the local supermarkets buying thousands of dollars of groceries all at once. They get around on bicycles for the most part. Everything about them seems highly coordinated and efficient. I’m sure they have no connection to the CCP or the PLA at all.The fact is that, thanks to the massive greed and treasonous behavior of the ruling class, our country’s corporations and society is massively infested at all levels with thinly disguised foreign agents. This may actually be a good thing to some degree since it means that if there are still some sane and fairly rational people in the State Dept and the MIC, they will know that the moment the lunatic neocons get their WWIII with China, Russia, or both, lots of stuff all across the country will start mysteriously blowing up and lots of our super high-tech planes with start flying into rock-filled clouds.

                    It’s not even debatable anymore. We are a conquered, subordinate people. The majority of our major cities are now ruled by individuals who openly and proudly reject America as traditionally understood.What I don’t get is why only the bad guys get to burn American flags. Can we do it too? America is (as Lawrence Auster correctly wrote in 2012, after Soetero was re-elected), “their country now.” I don’t get why burning the flag during the Bidenreich would not be “insurrection”. Of course we all know what burning the rainbow flag will get you; S&amp;M dungeon time in the cellars of DC…Seriously, that would be a real mind-rape of the enemy, our team burning American flags while wearing tricorn hats, carrying banners with Jefferson’s reminder about watering the tree of liberty.

For anyone who hasn’t yet seen the paper, it’s now been proved that v@xxine-induced multi-generational sterilization is very very real.
This was the original dire warning, at /pol/, way back in December of 2020:

And this is the new study, at Pub-Med, demonstrating multi-generational collapse of the ovaries [the keywords being “Follicular Atresia”]:

            The migrant housing and real estate in general is a good illustration of this. There are multiple forces intent on not letting the bubble of real estate value collapse. Some of these are investment firms, but a lot of it is elderly people who have vested their equity in property value. The reason property is expensive is because we have a supply/demand problem. We’re importing people faster than we can build houses. There will be insane demands that we relocate 1/5 of India to our shores before these groups tolerate the fact that the real value of their property will diminish by 60%.The problem is that every group we bring over to keep real estate prices high aren’t actually using their own money to prop up the system. Every Haitian migrant gets tax money to pay rent or, God forbid, purchase a house. That tax money is coming from the productive class. We give the Haitian money so he can give it to the property owners. There’s a very finite amount of that level of grift that a country can survive. You can’t pay people to buy things indefinitely, particularly when these people generate nothing of value and instead create more costs. Indians and Chinese are the same way but have other ways of looting the wealth of those around them. We can only tolerate a small amount of this parasitism. The middle class (if it truly still exists) is paying through the nose to subsidize the equity of property for the elderly and property investors. And this is just one example of the economic raiding going on. We’re losing unfathomable amounts of money into nothing which is what enrages me when cuckservatives grandstand about how infrastructure projects are “fraud waste and abuse.” At least Americans would see a large quality of life increase if we built 20 nuclear power plants across the Continental US and decreased power costs by 85% for 40% or more of the population (and allowing businesses that can monopolize on cheap power to have more incentives to stay in America). Instead we’re paying violent and scheming people to live among us.

                As the Boomers die off, the housing supply at least in theory will increase, no? And those with assets outside of real estate should be able to acquire it. I think you make a very good point here about the motivations behind keeping real estate inflated to an insane degree but importing savages to maintain prices seems unsustainable.

                    The people who are importing the migrants to pay them rent are short-sighted and either don’t believe that their efforts to loot wealth will lead to the US becoming Brazil or that they’ll be insulated enough from the consequences. The boomer sunset is why many nations like Canada and Australia are taking in “safer” migrant populations like Indians and Chinese. Their economic scheming is a little less noticeable than a Haitian welfare town in Ohio.

                    The entire system is hooked on endless mass migration and population increases. There won’t be any housing shortages or even any significant change of policy – see NYC where hundreds of thousands of people, mostly wage-earning, law-abiding, taxpaying citizens, left and were replaced by illiterate migrants. What do I see in NYC publications a year later – “NYC’s population back to pre-coof levels”, “migration saves NYC schools with increased funding”, etc.

At best the Donald will be a temporary slow down in the pace of importation.

                        NYC is on the verge of going to a very dark place. I don’t doubt that the propaganda will reflect what you describe, but I suspect the financial houses are just waiting for the opportunity to split.

                            Jack Dodson:NYC is on the verge of going to a very dark place.
The big question is when will the j00z decide to take off the gloves and go all “Gaza Strip” on the new denizens of J00 York City?
The j00z are existentially incapable of sustaining astablesocio-political situation for themselves precisely because j00ry necessarily DESTROYS rather than creates; anywhere and everywhere the j00 sets up shop is a locale which is doomed to be obliterated in the not-too-distant future.

                            Smaller and boutique ones already have, they moved to Florida. Yet NYC, in spite of all its problems, and the disastrous and spiteful management of it, and the fact that it is much degraded in the past 5 years, still has a lot to offer the upwardly mobile and wealthy. You walk around midtown on a nice day and it’s still quite pleasant and the art, restaurant, cultural scene is still there. So it continues to draw people in. Rents are still going up. It’s not collapsing yet.

Politics is power and patronage, same as it ever was per David Byrne. The Drone revolution will likely have far reaching effects to mitigate against it.

                Certainly we are importing people faster than we build housing.  However that’s only one factor.  Housing building costs have risen as well.  Well beyond the corresponding rise in wages.  All part of the increasing “haves and have nots” and the hollowing out of the once vaunted middle class.So we have increased inflation, increased mortgage rates, flat wages—failure to keep up with inflation, student debt repayment, and stricter mortgage loan requirements.  Here’s a statistic I recently read.  The average age of a first time home buyer in the early 80’s was 29.  The average age of first time home purchase in the 2020’s (2022), 36.36 is an all time record and indicates that the process of family (pro)creation, which used to be centered around settling down in a home and community is being pushed off into the future.  However, biology can *not* be postponed.  36 is at the absolute limits for a female and even if children can be had, the numbers quite limited at that age.  The “one and done” phenomenon.If you want “White” children, then make the traditional environment in which such were produced viable once again.

                    I commented similarly below to karl von hungus. Fertility windows were never generous and seem to have been artificially closing due to several factors. There are a lot of boomers with no grandchildren. My father is one of the few of his friends and coworkers who has grandchildren (my personal contribution in the war against attrition). Women don’t want kids until it’s too late, generally. I believe a lot of that is hormonal due to birth control and suppresses natural family-creation urges. After all, most common birth control measures trick a woman’s body into thinkingit already ispregnant. Why would they develop the urge to get pregnant if their body thinks they already are?I’ve been trying to do my small part and take my kids (who are adorable and well behaved) in public as often as possible to promote baby rabies in young white women. Kids are challenging and definitely limit one’s personal freedom and ability to live stress-free and enjoy life, but my wife and I take every pain to ensure that the young white women who see us out and about as a family don’t see that part. Raising kids is also a lot easier if you’re near extended family and can hand them off to Grandma and Grandpa for a weekend while you and your spouse enjoy some time together and get to engage in some liberties you don’t have with young kids, possibly leading to more young kids. Unfortunately, atomization in the US has led to a lot of extended family networks being spread across the country.

Place was packed, when in walked a White family of *7*—five children and two parents. Mother was nursing a baby that could not have been more than three months old. The oldest child could not have been more than eight. Best behaved children I’ve ever seen. Even the new born did not cry once.Wife and I kept staring at them. We could not help it. For one, such a family is never seen these days. Not here anyway. For two, we noticed how frugal the meals were for all. Children are children so they share a plate or two, but it seemed the parents could only order for themselves a hamburger and a coke, while I was on my third beer and boxing up what was left of my steak after paying the check. 😉Wife looked at me and I looked at her. She said, “Let’s get the waitress and pay their bill.” Did I tell you she’s a keeper? Anyway, turns out this mother of five and family was celebrating her birthday. (If you tell the waitress, the birthday girl gets a free dessert.)Check came out to $130. Not even a blip in the budget for this Boomer, but I suspect that family could put the money saved to good use elsewhere given their family size.Wife and I left quietly so as not to embarrass or interrupt the family event. Best money I spent all week. Not many benefits to being old, this is one of the few.

Families like that were the norm when I grew up in the Mesozoic.  My maternal grandparents had seven kids, closely space, that how ya worked the farm back then.
‘She said, “Let’s get the waitress and pay their bill.’
I was gonna suggest that to you for future incidents, but your wife was on the job.
Next time, make sure you beat her to noble impulses. Careful generosity pays dividends.

                                        Might be, but I thought Mormons didn’t drink caffeinated drinks either?As I’ve related previously, our son resides in a Mormon neighborhood.  There’s one mother who has a child sized electric “train” that she drives up and down the street on weekends to give the neighborhood children rides.  Such is the family life in a neighborhood where children are the entire point of marriage and church plays a dominate role in their lives.One also notices that there is more than one home with an army surplus “deuce and a half“ in the driveway or front yard.  These folk don’t screw around.It’s a neighborhood where the neighbors know your dog and when he gets out will walk him with theirs and then bring him home.  True story.As Ray points out, a time long past in the USA.

                        The atomization in this country is a huge problem.  When we visit our son in Spain, you see the opposite – grandparents, parents and kids hanging out or participating in some activities.  Something you rarely see in America, unfortunately.

                            Even though my parents are deep into their 70s and have endured knee replacements, they still get around pretty well and we love spending time with them. My youngest children (all teenagers who aren’t constantly plugged into their phones) still sleep over at their house any chance they can get.
It’s sad other families aren’t the same way.

                        I did my part with five children and my oldest son has met a wonderful, devout girl at college (they go to a strong Catholic institution that stresses the Catholic part) and they intend to marry once he graduates. Her parents are wonderful Catholic people too.I told him that children are a gift and material things are fleeting. I also told him God wants us to be fruitful and multiply. My hope is he has so many grandchildren that I have to rent a party bus to pick them all up at once.I wish I would’ve spent more time with my children and not been overseas fighting stupid wars. The best time of my life was raising my children and teaching them to be good Christian men and women. I wouldn’t trade it for all of the riches of this world.

                            Most girls have the emotional maturity to handle the beginnings of marriage and babies around 18-20 or so. We started our family at 25 and it was a good time to do so, although it felt a little late. Sentencing people to 16 years of school plus overall on every angle, including children.

                    Building houses has indeed become vastly more expensive. The permitting process is awful, the Canadian softwood tariffs and US environmental policies have driven materials through the roof, and I was dumbfounded to learn that a kid fresh out of high school with 3 years of shop class can get $50/hr. Yep, $100k plus OT.
But the demand side is also a problem. I thought my age group (born ’64) were perpetual children, but turns out we were pikers. Unlike today’s youth, we had that crazy uncle who asked, “What kind of job will that degree get you?”

                    A small landowner in upstate New York is pointing out that solar farm companies are scheming to snap up every available scrap of viable farm and pasture land in the US.
She mentions something we didn’t know: those toxic solar panels, when they quickly turn to junk,leave the land unarable.
How many of them will be left in place like defunct windmills?
Not placement on commercial buildings, shopping malls, hospitals, or solar canopies over highways.  Oh no.  Not even marginal land, it has to be good land.

                    This country no longer takes a rational problem solving approach to anything except the “problem” of how to funnel more money into the pockets of the oligarchs and their corporations. The need for additional nuclear power and the futility of the “Green New Deal” is obvious from the physics of power generation and the diffuse nature of solar energy inputs. Until recently though this was ignored and screaming numerically illiterate women and soyboys were allowed to dominate the discussion of energy policy. Now it’s OK to look at reality because it benefits the insiders.I wouldn’t get too hopeful though. Power will get cheaper because they need it to replace you at your job. Maybe there will be a window of cheap energy while you can still afford it.

                “The problem is that every group we bring over to keep real estate prices high aren’t actually using their own money to prop up the system.”That seems a bit of a jump in logic, or needs more qualifying/elaboration for my limited understanding.  The influx of “immigrants” we typically decry are precisely the type that cannot afford most of the single family residential housing stock.  Here in my burg for example, the median housing price is now at an all time high of $340k. But the median household income is around $60k, which falls short of such a purchase in today’s market and mortgage rates.I am not aware of simply giving “immigrants” money to buy houses, albeit there *are* programs of very limited amounts that will fund down payments for mortgages.  These usually have a short time for application and limited funds.  They are announced every year or so when the new fiscal years begins.  Still doesn’t handle the problem monthly mortgage payment vs income mismatch.What has that to do in my neighborhood where housing costs now commonly approaches/exceeds $1M?  Heretofore, such housing was predominantly paid for in cash, not by mortgage.  Why?  Well, we are told by realtors these buyers are CA “refugees”.  So technically migrants, but not I think as you describe.  I suppose Vancouver is a good example of foreigners (Chinese) buying up available housing as “investment” and driving prices up, but is that importing “immigrants”, rather than selling off parts of the country of Canada to foreign investors.My answer to housing shortage—which is predominantly on the low end—is to examine and reduce regulation imposed by many States on housing developments which are a huge part of costs.

                    First, code compliance is a small and marginal cost increase in SFH construction. R19 batts in 2×6 walls increases the cost of a $300,000 build by like $2000 over r13 and 2x4s. ive seen 2×6 studs cheaper than 2×4 doug firs. Zoning, imho, is a tenuous hold on slowing development, and is often woefully insufficent of a barrier to excessive expansion beyond the reasonable resources of existing communities (public works/utilities as well as transportation infrastructure).Housing cost insanity results from a displacement “push” mechanism.  Poors are pushed into working class accommodations and working class whites are pushed out of cheap housing by S8 and the pet-eaters, who push lower middle class into moving as fast as they can into middle/umc housing, which pushes umc out faster and further. Everyone has to move up and out as fast as their credit score will let them, or else their kids end up getting enriched. Everyone flees the diversity as far and fast as they can, making ripples much bigger than the pebble that started the movement.  Thus, housing of every and all types rides a rocket to the moon.

                        I don’t disagree with your analysis of push/pull to get away from rif-raf and the resulting effect on housing prices.  I do disagree on your slighting regulation costs.Of course, much variation exists across the country, but a vague question posed to ChatGPT yields the following:”Regulations—including zoning, building codes, permits, impact fees, energy mandates, and delays—are widely estimated to add 20–30% to the cost of a new single-family home in the U.S.”That’s not trivial, and in my example from my burg would easily account for the mismatch between median home price and median household income not being able to afford their own home.

                There are lots of places like around here in Oregon, where the land use laws make the idea of “market forces” in housing totally absurd. The only forces that matter are the various insiders who decide just how big the housing shortage will be and where a few token new homes will be allowed to be built. Once you add in the totally politically controlled influx of foreign trash you can see that the local housing market is just a crooked casino where the only way to win at the card tables is to know the dealer.

                Abortions are for women too stupid or too insouciant to take birth control. Most white women are more or less intelligent enough to take birth control, so from a demographic perspective the problem is not abortion, it’s birth control.
I’ve never bought into the dissident-right argument that abortion is good because it’s mostly Negroes and Democrats having abortions. Personally I think it’s a moral outrage, but completely aside from that, even white women who do not have abortions do not produce enough white babies.

                            Right. Not everyone’s Catholic. The Jews, for instance,  are big proponents of abortion.Around here there was a big Jewish abortionist who also ran a fertility clinic. Anything for a shekel, I guess.When people started doing 23 and Me they discovered that, strangely enough, they had like 30 brothers and sisters. All the mothers were his patients. Turns out he was jacking off and inseminating his IVF patients with his own Jew jiz.He died in a plane crash when the wings literally fell off (LOL)  so maybe there is Divine Providence after all.But yeah, if you’re not hip to Catholic ethics, the Jews will step right up to the plate and pinch hit with THEIR ethics.

                                We totally can impose Catholic values and make them the law of the land without making everyone Catholic or have to go to Mass on Sunday. That’s what modern Catholic state would look like. It would be outlawing stuff like abortion while leaving people free to choose the Church, rather be coerced into it.

                                    So 30% get to impose their Sharia Law on the rest? And you think that’s going to fly? Is it any wonder people hate you conservatives?
Actually, it’s far less than 30%. My Roman Catholic family members aren’t too far off from what I believe.

                                        I’m not a conservative, I’m a reactionary. I genuinely don’t care what your (probably) American averse family thinks. The Catholic moral code has no equal, because it comes from God. If your family were serious Catholics, they’d agree with me. Catholicism isn’t just a set of rituals handed down between generations.

                            It’s an offense to your god, not to mine. My God is Jesus and he said absolutely nothing about it in the Bible. The anti-abortion stance is an invention of fanatics. The same brain as the Sharia Law types.

                                There’s a commandment about not making someone unalive. Babies count and perhaps even more so. I’m sorry if the issues is somehow personal, but I suggest that Confession would be in order, rather than attempts to argue over it.

                                        This argument is genuinely hoping that God isn’t clear on this point. The Old Testament is beside itself regarding child sacrifice. Jesus is quite clear on God’s love for children. Go to Confession, if that’s the issue. “What about ism” doesn’t change it.

            Demographics are a problem of our own making. There is this terrible idea that we need a continuously expanding population.When is the last time you were driving on any American road and thought to yourself, “You know what this road needs? MORE CARS! MORE PEOPLE!”We have an economic system which requires never ending growth. Growth is our national religion. It is most likely the primary reason for all the invasions of White countries.We don’t need more people or hostile foreigners to save us, we need a system that does not require more of us or more of them.We are already well past the natural carrying capacity of Earth. Natural systems are breaking down all over the place. Yet we want to continue to have an ever expanding population?

                    Sure, but we are beyond the food production limits without tons and tons of fertilizer, artificial watering and mechanized agriculture.  Soil salination and depletion are expanding. Ground water is also depleting. A lot of fishing areas are depleted of fish. Without fish farming, fish would probably be too expensive to eat.
All these maniacs want to cover what is left of nature with solar panels because they fear the weather.

            At last count, there will be 1,800 “No Kings” rallies tomorrow across the fruited plain. Local news channels are helpfully providing locations and scheduling. You have to credit the enemy: they can organize, mobilize, and actualize entirely synthetic “events” like this. The only similar “movement” to preserve and protect a moribund system that I know of is the “Black Hundreds” op of the Russian secret police in late imperial Russia. In large empires it isn’t difficult to find enough people whose qualifications are just ignorance, hatred and lots of free time.We (by “we” I mean more or less normal people) might outnumber these lunatics and their sponsors by 4 or 5 to 1, But that isn’t sufficient. If you live in a village of 2500 people, as I do, I am not comforted by the knowledge that there are “only” 500 lunatics in town. Especially as said lunatics are networked, committed to the “cause”, and could well be impeding traffic, chanting slogans and waving their signs, tomorrow, in my little town. And if I give one of them the finger, I could end up on their hit list. You cannot confront them, you can only avoid them. Which means they own the streets.And this is the reason that we are doomed. Thoughtful, civic-minded, family-oriented people must now stand by, silent, as freaks and weirdos, and of course their unseen puppeteers, assume control of the public square. A healthy society cannot exist without normal people, but normal people lack the militant and single-minded focus on conquest and power our enemies have. I see no way out of this, short of a Carrington Event that disrupts the organizational techniques of the enemy.And throws us all back into the early 19th century… but hey, they managed.

            Huma Abedin, once the plaything of the j00, Anthony Wiener, is now the plaything of an entirely different j00, Alex Soros [son of the über-j00, George Soros].

I wonder how long it will be before we goyim are finally informed that the Abedin family was never Muslim in the first place; that in fact they had always been crypto-Mizrahic j00z, working for the Council of the Sanhedrin and the Mossad?
Huma Abedin’s ostensible father, Zainul Abedin, was an heap big figure in Islamic studies; he has a very lengthy Wikipedia entry:

                There was an interesting post on X that was attributed to this person. It was allegedly an email from Abedin to either her brother, or someone she called her brother.
It related to The Shrew, and described her state during her run for President.
Apparently, it was much worse than we were led to believe.

Israel clearly can do what it wants and no one in the region can, or will stop it.   They have nukes, they have a superpower who will back it in the UN, and have no hesitation killing anyone of any military or political rank anywhere without warning.

In the best tradition of pro wrestling, it’s all kayfabe.This is confirmed by the revelation Trump’s spat with Bibi was fake, as were the negotiations. It was all designed to get Iran to lower its guard in preparation for the strike.

But if Iran “lowered it’s guard” to talk to Trump, they deserve what’s coming.
America is not to be trusted.
Nor, is Israel. (who has the Epstein files, nukes, sophisticated cyber offensive capabilities and ICBMs capable of hitting the continental US.)

                How many times does MacGregor have to be wrong for him to qualfy his prognostications?
He’s predicted Israel’s destruction,an Israel Turkey war, Russia occupying Kiev in 2023…
He seems to believe that he never made general because he was too talented and a threat to the perfumed Pentagon princes but it might be due to  his catastrophic and aggressively wrong judgements. Calm down, Douglas!

        “but we know Trump is powerless to do anything about it”
Particularly as Trump’s pecker is in Israel’s back pocket. But the more general point is that the country is controlled by various special interests. Probably always has been. Ours not to wonder why. I agree entirely that the financlal and energy situation is very wobbly and precarious.

            Seriously, it’s getting kind of tiresome listening to endless refrain that Trump is trying to do the right thing and he just keeps getting hoodwinked by all those blob people, or the “guys we just have to let Trump do a little bit of what the Js want then Trump will be able to save us from the Mexicans and bathroom trannies.What I’ve seen so far isn’t any different than any other Republican president if not worse.  The campaign promises to the dirt people are largely performative and superficial (we’ll put a few dozen creepy looking tattooed Mexicans in white underpants and frog march them around for the camera while importing another half a million Pajeet H1-Bs).The reality is that Trump has been sucking the c*ck of earlobes Hitler the whole time, he is going to keep sucking that c*ck his entire presidency, and he WANTS to suck that c*ck, he craves that c*ck above all things, his daddy trained him to suck circumcised c*ck and take the load with a smile like Harvey Weinstein’s ficus.  I’m sorry to all the people who hoped they’d get some manner of political representation this time around but to anyone who still thinks that’s the case I’ve got some $TRUMP and a bridge to sell you.

        Demographics will change quickly. They already have, but it will accelerate. The reality of this will precede the perception. Just as boomers still think it’s 1985, while in fact demographics have made us a different country than we were then, in 10-20 years millennials will still think it’s 2025, but it won’t be. An ethnically homogenous country can endure all kinds of crises and come out the other side, but a dieverse one will fracture under stress. The nature of the stress is not so important. It’s like terrain theory in medicine. A healthy body can resist pathogens, but a weak one can’t. The only possible remedy is mass deportation, but that looks like kind of a moonshot right now.The competence crisis is real. It means the schism will be that much more retarded.

And do they take hours getting ready for a big night, such as an anniversary? Do any of them have the equivalent of a beauty shop or a manicure salon? I didn’t think so…

        there are myriad possible reasons for population collapse, and they have different implications (re: Dennis Reynolds).
what it comes down to, are people being prevented in some way, or are they choosing no kids for some reason.
and of course all the enumerated reasons can be in effect simultaneously.
if the vaxx damaging human eggs is widespread, then there is not much anyone can do about it.

            A common saying since at least 2014 is that white people don’t breed in captivity. A lot of people blame affluence for the dearth of young families, but that doesn’t track based off historical data. Coming hot off WWII, America was at one of its most affluent periods. What did we get? A baby boom. During Trump’s first term there was a baby boom. This one will likely result in one as well. Most people don’t want to start a family during uncertain times. That’s compounded with the talking points about it being “irresponsible” to have kids before your life is in order. Unfortunately, from at least the 90s until recently, “in order” meant both parents with degrees and upwardly-mobile white-collar jobs and a house. Those two things were getting scarcer.Biden’s job program resulted in a net gain of jobs for every group except white men, who experienced a net loss. Housing has suffered under the supply/demand problem. Real estate investors and the elderly are unwilling to see home values drop so they lobby aggressively to maintain the artificial inflation of their homes by generating infinite demand, even if they have to use tax payer money to hand to the Haitians to hand back to themselves. Younger generations are getting taxed into oblivion to pay the undeserving to compete against them.As for infertility, it’s certainly on the rise. The amount of plastic you interact with every day is obscene. People leach plastics from the clothes they wear more often than they think. Vaccines are almost certainly a means of promoting infertility. Bill Gates once smirked as he told an audience they’d control population in Africa through sex education, contraceptives, and vaccines. One of those things is not (or isn’t supposed to be) like the others. Giving the game away, aren’t we? Diet also has a lot to do with fertility. Our food is generally trash. People go go to Europe tell me how they come back and eat American food and feel awful for about a week until they readjust to the slop. People are also trying to have kids later, after they’ve attained the aforementioned conditions. Female fertility declines sharply after 30. I read 1 in 10 women are infertile by age 30 about 10 years ago. With compounding factors, it’s probably worse. Hormonal birth control is also probably responsible for a lot of ills. There were never any longitudinal studies on lifetime use for birth control as the indication of use was for short-term management of irregular cycles. The data now is almost impossible to obtain because there’s almost no control group and nobody with money (FDA, drug companies) will conduct a study because they suspect that the results will be catastrophic.

Why, because they’d have the largest number of native speakers after they absorbAztlán?

                    One can pull an endless parade of horribles from the (unknown) future.  That is not a rebuttal, just contradiction.  The fracturing of the nation I assume has a purpose and my assumptions is that it will be from internal forces and designed to reduce internal problems.  If one of those is race, then there will be no more imports of differing races as that was the problem in the first place and the “new” nation will center itself around laws and custom to prevent recurrence.

            Why would splitting up be catastrophic? Would think that a secure Honkyland but with less GDP and no amazon deliveries, but without all the vibrancy, would be a double plus good. But yes, some people certainly need to be banned from entry, much less positions of power.

                That’s my point. We had a secure honkyland and they pissed in the water and made it undrinkable. Do you think they’re going to let us have our own place? Our worst enemies are from within. You know, the do-gooders who think letting the browns in and sharing our blessings would be the Christian thing to do.

                Some of the numbers once needed I recall seeing commentary wrt structural internal changes causing those numbers needed to be revised “downward”, thus the ability to claim the (new) personnel target numbers were now being met.  I have not pursued this.

        I didn’t even realize it was Friday the 13th. Fitting. Knowing the aggressors’ obsession with numerology and magic, I wouldn’t be surprised if the date was chosen on purpose.Taking Trump at face value, it is obvious Israel undermined his ability to forge a peace with Iran. Not just in this attack, but the way they worked to ensure that the Republicans would not support any realistic or possible deal. The only option Trump has at this point if he wants to be a leader is to cut Israel loose. Of course this would immediately put another target on his head and cause major issues, but this is what leadership is. I don’t expect him to do it because he’s not that man, but that is what is necessary now.

        So I enjoyed the experience of driving through and around a large anti-Trump event here in one of the inner suburbs of my city at around nine this morning. It was big, 2-3 thousand people, at a guess. Traffic backed up. swarms of pedestrians flowing back and forth through the intersections, madly waiving placards and flags and such at me and every other motorist stuck there, chanting really clever stuff like “hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go!!” It’s a heavily-Jewish neighborhood, and among the varied impedimenta were a few Israeli flags, lots of upside-down American flags, and of course no end of rainbow flags.It got me to thinking. This particular suburb probably has a higher average household income than any other jurisdiction in the metro area… this FNG “revolution” is not of the poor and the powerless, but of the bored and the irrelevant. People without any “core”. Pampered, overfed, systemically taught to conform to the most naked lies and distortions.This crisis – and it is a no-shit crisis – is one of pointlessness, These people simply don’t know why they’re alive. OK, I am just spitballing here. I really fail to grasp the motivation behind all this stupid behavior; I can do no better than conclude that all these people are just… bored. They remind me more of a home crowd at a college basketball game, than the swarms of protesters carrying guns and red flags through Moscow as in a Sergei Eisenstein film.I despise them, but part of me pities them. At some level, the 75-year old hippie in his Che t-shirt, waving a cardboard placard in a mass rally, and the 55-year old griller in his Josh Allen jersey mowing his lawn, are kin. They’ve erased themselves, somehow, from the book of life.

        If surplus people are a danger with the advent of AI and the likelihood of a bright, disgruntled and large unemployed contingent, isn’t a population collapse a good thing in that narrow regard? Maybe there aren’t as many people around to pay off the debt, but there are also fewer useless eaters to ravage the public weal. As you point out, civilizations tend to emerge stronger from population declines. I don’t see population collapse necessarily as a paramount problem, with one major exception: the lack of manpower to fight back invasions from places without population collapse, almost exclusively Sub-Saharan Africa. I don’t discount mass migration could be much worse with that disparity.There also is so much overlap between the various Doom scenarios that they are all but impossible to isolate from one another. Demographic changes and population collapse, for example, exacerbate one another–Race X reproduces at a lower rate than Race Y, and Race Y over time becomes more powerful even if overall it also shrinks in raw numbers (white and Hispanic, which I agree is a somewhat phony category). Secession, which is happening even now in the form of political fragmentation and mass internal migration and sorting, has the same effect of civil war and certainly can lead to it. When we look at the gestalt, which is composed of the individual crises/potential crises you cite, the picture overall is bleak and each problem melds into the other.

            Evolution is fast. Yes, change through breeding, mutation, and genetics is mathematically too slow to work, but genetics don’t happen in a controlled environment.
That’s what Darwin saw off the collapsed coast of Chile- it was that theenvironmentchanges, often quickly or even catatrophically. Evolution’s markers measure the change in the physical conditions, and the adaptation to those changes.
Genetics are memory in the flesh, the surviving remembrance of past places.Each face shows the climate conditions of 10,000 years ago; this tells us that souls, too, are long-lasting memory embedded in a different substrate.

            American political time scale condensed down to internet speeds.The kids on Twitter have a “Nothing ever happens” club because their time reference is a month or less. Taking down Syria took a decade. Spinning up Ukraine to fight Russia for NATO also a decade. Israel has been running wars against her neighbors in a bid for domination for over a quarter century – Qaddafi, Iraq, Afghanistan, Iraq – Iran, etc.But it is also understandable. America has no capital reserves of any kind. Every cloudy days means something new has broken that can never be fixed. Living in that world means that you can only be happy when the sun is shining, and these are cloudy days.Putin is the most powerful man in the world right now. A lot can change, slowly or quickly, depending on what he decides.NATO is run by the intel agencies, Mossad included, and the Russians will not have missed that NATO ran cover under civilian vehicles to attack strategic assets in Russia and Iran.Putin may talk big about UN treaties and law, but it amounts to nothing if he refuses to start shooting people attached to those intel agencies. Like every other liberal institution to include the US Constitution, they are psyops that allow defectors to murder millions in the name of wealth and power while the rubes cry about the rules.That is the hinge of history at the moment.

        I have long argued that the collapse is the cure, and therefore is not to be feared but embraced. Nothing changes until the environment changes, and the models clearly predict that only a world war or global societal collapse can bring about the necessary macro-motivation for serious remedy to commerce. World war means nuclear war and that equates with a colony collapse scenario; not good! The alternative is a return of real hardship and competition-based culling; only the smart and strong shall prevail. Be the latter.

        For the past three months the price of oil has moved very little, hovering around 58 or 61 dollars a barrel.  All during that time gas in my area was 3.40 to 3.50 a gallon.  In the last three weeks its dropped from 3.40 to around 2.94.  First time its been under 3 here since covid.  Meanwhile, in the past an action like the one that happened last night would drop the rates on .gov debt a fair amount, the “flight to safety” as they used to call it.  As i type this oil is up 5 bucks to 73 and rates are actually going up.  interesting

        Is peace even desireable for our side? Perhaps we should sing, “all we are saying is, give war a chance. Peace is over, if you want it.”As the nature of War has changed a great deal. It is often hybrid. The CIA/Ukraine putting all those containers thousands of miles from the front lines in Russia to attack their nuclear bombers, and doing the same thing with Israel to attack Iran’s missile system from short range where nothing can really be done, is not just a Western trick.Iran, Russia, China can all do it too. And even the most sophisticated police states cannot prevent this, as the flood of container shipping and all sorts of foreigners makes this kind of attack impossible to stop under the current system.So how does a nation under attack by this method respond?EXPEL all foreigners. Dudes waving Mexican or Honduran flags are a security risk, one day they are buning down a Waymo, the next launching a drone attack for money on parked bombers, or Hoover Dam, or something else.Radically reduce trade and ban container shipping. Unless it is by rail, and then require non-container trucks to connect to rail. Aim being to move containers away from any high value target.Even a police state cannot stop attacks, so MOTIVATE loyalists (White American men) and arm them, and reward them for stopping attacks.Basically a War Time Hybrid War coming to America means defense in depth. The last point, #3, is likely to be the most effective and would require doing things some elites want: crushing feminism, METOO, DEI, all the rest that smarter elites know will come for them eventually.Nukes have not gone away. The relative peace of the proxy-war Cold War, with far away wars: Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan has given way to Hybrid Wars with deniable direct attacks on Russia (soon China and the US) by other super powers. Even more so as demographic decline makes mass casualty mass assaults internally non-sustainable. Hybrid War can be good for us if we push hard on this. Emmanuel is right, never let a crisis go to waste.

        Fear not, the Sun won’t simply wink out and take all life on Earth in an instant. G2V stars, as they enter their terminal phase, expand into a red giant. Our particular star is projected to slowly expand to eclipse the orbit of Mars. As it does that, it will begin tossing lethal doses of radiation that will poison all life in the inner solar system.

                Yeah, the end of mankind due to the end of the sun is a quaint, but meaningless observation.  Such changes in the sun are millions and millions of years in the future.  How long have “humans” in a form we recognize as human been here?  Certainly less than a million years.
Odds are we will vanish of our own accord long before the Sun puts an end to things, or more optimistically, we’ll travel out of this solar system and continue to evolve on other planets while watching the sun collapse light years away.

                    This is literally billions of years in the future.I am not a techno-optimist, especially in the near and medium term.  I believe there is no chance of colonizing the Moon or Mars in the near to medium term.  The problems we cannot solve now or likely to solve in the near to medium term future, are near endless.  We cannot create a large domed city here, let alone on the Moon or Mars. Not just the city either, but the many square kilometer which would be required for self sufficiency just in agriculture. Mining in a near vacuum sounds like fun too.  That is assuming it could ever work at all.Even if we could throw a few people (5-10 at the most) on either body, they would be entirely dependent on Earth and continuing support.  We’re never going to farm in lava tubes, even if they were a viable option to live in.  While the Moon is easier to get to, it’s even worse than Mars in terms of trying to live there independently. If it is not self supporting and independent, it’s pointless.Both the Moon and Mars are trivially easy in comparison to trying to start a civilization on a planet around another sun.  Just getting people there is a much, much harder proposition and would take longer to get there than a human lifespan.It’s all wishful thinking by dreamers.

                        Certainly, technological progress has to be made before we are able to “jump ship”.  But you extend a rather limited time table to where our technology is today and how long it took, to a future that, if we are not foolish, could extend millennia.
What we see about us was unimaginable 200-300 years ago.  That’s all the time it took to get here today.  300 year from now…?

            Ok, I’ll reply to myself. The murders in Minnesota. All I can find is reference to “state lawmakers”. So, what are we talking about? Senators, state senators, village board members? Why can’t I find a basic news account answering these primary-level questions? Ok, so now I am watching a presser by Walz, dressed in his warmup jacket or whatever that is, and still no details. Why do we live in a world where basic information isn’t available?At a guess, riots will be on the menu next week after this “event” – if that what it is – when the media has sculpted an anti-Trump narrative from it.Oh, and by the way, has anyone heard news of the proceedings against the would-be assassin #2? Ha ha, joke question. Of course no one has. For all we know he might be living somewhere in the Caribbean, with a federal stipend.

        Mr Z man
Excellent show. I think you are spot on with the demographics being the number one risk. The loss of the smart fraction from the capable culture that built western society is disappearing. It only seems logical the civilization they built will disappear with them.
My only question is how far will civilization have to regress to match the capabilities of the new group?

                    Brazil is much whiter than South Africa, especially in the south of the country. But it has sufficient diversity to insure a fair level of crime.

        The West, Sunnis, and Israel want to belatedly erase one of their bad decisions, the overthrow of the Shah. The hard part will be getting Russia to accept an undefended southern flank, vulnerable to further depradations.Israel is trying to manage optics gone terribly wrong, but as old hands at this game of calculated murder, they anticipated and were prepared for it.* Who dares, wins.If the mullahs are overthrown by someone just as bad as they are, well they should’ve consolidated their gains at home and played ball instead of wasting Persian people’s scarce economy on arming the Shia Crescent.Khomeini wasn’t supposed to go rogue. No, you Ali retards, Tehran is not going to replace Mecca as the capitol of the Caliphate. It’s not a new Baghdad, Damascus, or Cordoba.*(That’s why the Palestine protests are funded by Jewish and Israeli NGOs, to paint Jews as victims under attack. Optics.)

        For those disappointed with Trump, or angry over his antics, this sort of kayfabe is who and what he is as a politician. He is not a fox like Gavin Newsom, but a hedgehog who has one great talent: baiting his opponents into taking the opposite of a 80/20 split not just with the public but powerful elites. It is why he is President and Kamala Harris is not.As entirely predictable attacks on Jews in the US, and US military bases here in the US by various immigrant Muslims cascade and Dems rush to defend them, again not just public opinion (which is meaningless) but powerful elite opinion (which actually means something), Trump gets more freedom of action. More freedom from Judges, more freedom from the media, more freedom from obstructionism with the “magic” of “National Security” and the reality of powerful elites moving on their own to crush Lawfare and obstructionism.Just imagine the “Resistance” spilling over into attacks on Synagoges or other stuff on Saturday. Now their best plans roll into an anti-Elite jihad that gains Trump support. And all Newsom’s clever positioning as the leader of the illegal alien resistance, BLM Latino style, gets overwhelmed by Iran’s counter-attack by jihad in the US.Trump is Trump: in the WWE Hall of Fame, as a dude who baits the opposition into taking the losing stance. Trump was never going to make peace with his limited powers and the “Resistance” constantly fighting him. Unlike his first term he’s turned that reflexive opposition into ANYTHING he does into a strength.

        After October 7th, Israel has been progressively DONE with all its enemies, finally realizing that none of them – Hamas, Assad, Iran, Hezbollah, etc. – have the slightest interest in peace and serious negotiations. So they’re going to the mattresses. Former enemies like Egypt and Jordan have negotiated peace, and it has lasted. There are still around 20 living Israeli hostages still held in Gaza, coming up to 2 years after October 7. Why should this be borne, by anyone?Logic for attacking Iran now is similar to Russia’s in striking Ukraine in 2022: if you leave it further down the road, it may well be too late. Unfriendly NATO bases with nukes on your doorstep, German-led armies a day’s march from Moscow.Not saying I endorse either war, but I can see the Israeli and Russian viewpoints.

            Well, there are two immediate problems that I see.One of course is a moral problem.  The equation of how many innocents does one kill to produce a lasting peace or avenge the dead is a hard one to put numbers to.  Not that I’m arguing any particular position.  Then there is the seeming reality that Israel is intent on driving out all from Gaza.  Another moral conundrum—where the current population of millions has no where to go.And finally, can war against such immense populations ever succeed?  Quite a gamble.  Iran is large and now perhaps forced to go all out on their nuke program.  The thought that their program has been destroyed rather than disrupted is without evidence. Rather I suspect the current “plan” is to delay the program and entice American participation in the conflict due to abandonment of talks.  Wildcard is Russia, which has a mutual assistance treaty with Iran wrt to foreign attacks.  Given all the “fuckery” by NATO in the Ukrainian conflict, much mischief can be created by Russia sending equipment and knowledge to the assistance of Iran.  Indeed Putin warned of such as a response to NATO not too long ago.

                “Gamble” a word I am increasingly associating with Netanyahu – but is it justified? Hezbollah won’t even go in to bat for Iran now, thanks to Israel’s military offensive.  And remember Russia not long ago failed to defend their client state Armenia (not to mention the Assad regime). Do they even have the resources to commit to Iran when they’re borrowing troops from North Korea? Is Netanyahu gambling, or he outsmarting everyone – including the Israeli public and elites who want him out of office and in jail?I agree that the goal is to get us embroiled, so we can drop a few MOABs on Iran’s nuke facilities.

                    Russia needs no military assistance from Korea.  The numbers of Koreans used were just a show for NATO wrt a newly forged alliance with “rocket man”.  Putin is casualty adverse and uses many allies, such as militias from the Oblast regions annexed and old adversaries such as from Chechnya.  Even a privately organized fighting group such as the Wagner group.You mention failure to support Armenia with troops—something similar to Biden and Afghanistan?  🙂  Wise leaders know when to cut their losses. WRT the big strategic conflict, Ukraine/NATO, the Russians are winning on every front.  People think the pace of victory indicates weakness.  Rather it indicates a strategy to minimize casualties for Russia.The Russians can give the best—if they have not already—anti aircraft weapons to Iran and they can do exactly as NATO does for Ukraine by furnishing intelligence from satellites and ground stations and such.  They need not put fighting troops on the ground.  Indeed, the war against Iran will never see troops on the ground.  Iran has a population of 92M people!  No one can field an army capable of subduing and occupying such a large country.Finally, if MOAB’s could reach Iran’s refined uranium (all buried under ground), Israel would have used them.  Instead they took a surprising, but easier target, people.  People can be replaced however.  It’s just a matter of time.  Knowledge once obtained is never lost.  Iran has not been put out of the nuke business and very well may have been incentivized to move even faster to join “the club”.The only logic I see behind this attack is to delay nuke fabrication in a vain hope for American intervention or internal uprising in Iran, but we shall see as time to evaluate Israel’s attack results passes.  Right now the Neocons are chanting war as they always do.  They and the Israeli lobby in the USA are playing it all up.  Truth is the first thing to be lost in war.

As far Russia…successfully staving off Armeni’s defeat by Azerbaijan and consequent loss of Nagorno-Karabakh would have taken a minimal investment: maybe a few thousand troops. The fact that Russia didn’t do this hints that they are stretched in Ukraine. Now Armenia is moving into the EU/US orbit.

                        One more consideration is that NATO/Europe WANTS Iran taken out by Israel. Iran has provided Russia with thousands of drones and ballistic missiles, all used to kill Ukrainians. Bringing Iran to its knees means cutting off that supply and victory on another front in our (thus far) undeclared war against Russia.

                            WRT drones, Iran supplied many to Russia when these weapons turned out to be critically useful.  Russia adapted these Iranian drones to use Russian supplied guidance/communication.   The Russians also contracted with Iran and build these drones themselves.  In short, Iran may be a useful supplier, but are not longer essential.
The is nothing short of direct involvement by NATO personnel that might save Ukraine, and even that is doubtful.  The EU simply has nothing left to provide Ukraine except perhaps more cannon fodder.

                “Antisemitic” has to be one of the most egregious bullshit words now in common use. Words mean things, and “semitic” means:adjective (1) relating to or denoting a family of languages that includes Hebrew, Arabic, and Aramaic and certain ancient languages such as Phoenician and Akkadian,constitutingthe mainsubgroupof the Afro-Asiatic family. (2) relating to the peoples who speak Semitic languages, especially Hebrew and Arabic.Therefore, “antisemitic” = being opposed to speaking any one of the languages included in the semitic language family. Or, being opposed to any people whose natural language is classified as ‘semitic’ as opposed to, say, Indo-European or Ural-Altaic.So, you can be anti-semitic if you have a problem with the Carthaginians sacrificing infants to Moloch. They spoke a derivative of Phoenician, and were quite obviously assholes (except Hannibal, one of my favorite ancient generals).As a left-hander, I am pro-semitic. I wish that we could write from right to left as the semites do. Less ink or pencil lead on the edge of my hand, less smudging, less interference from the coil in the notebook on my writing hand.

            Surprised, a little, by the cascade of downvotes. What you wrote is trenchant and makes good sense from the Israeli perspective. The parallel you draw to Russia’s situation is incisive as well. Both countries find themselves threatened by implacable enemies.I’m no fan of Israel, in fact the “Israel Uber alles” vibe we get from the GOP is tiresome to the extreme. However, it is natural that any country vulnerable to attack and possible annihilation would apply all counter-measures available.But, “German-led armies a day’s march from Moscow?”  You lost me there. Even in 2025, an army from Germany won’t be in Moscow in a day. Or a month. Or a year. And any western army imaginable won’t be led by Germany, or for that matter, have many Germans in it.

                I mean German-led EU/NATO armies camped out on the eastern Ukraine border,  a day’s drive from Moscow.Just because Germany/EU is emasculated and led by gaggotians and girlbosses today doesn’t mean that will be the case ten years from now. The latent power is still there: they are Europe’s most powerful and capable tribe. In Putin’s nightmare scenario, Russia faces a Germany/EU across the Dnieper, this time not fighting on several fronts, with most of the world against it, but with its rear secured by UK/US and drawing on an EU population of 450 million. France, Britain &amp; other European countries can all crank up weapons production quickly if the need arises. Germany has called the shots within the EU for some time now (where is the ECB located?).

                    The first direct NATO invasion will be met by Russia’s tactical nukes.  The policy of such a strike was clearly set out a year or so ago by Putin.  Only France and Britain have a nuke deterrence force and I’m not sure what they have in the tactical, battlefield, sense.  In any event, the nuke force these two nations possess pales in numbers fielded by Russia—or the USA for that matter.Any crossing of the border by a fielded NATO army will not allow any EU production of weaponry in time for ramping up armaments.  Any such conflict will be fought with supplies on hand, which are reportedly in short supply even for a defensive posture.  That’s what a generation of misallocation of defense resources does to a country.

        Yes, you are doomed.it’s a good thing.   Watching you get rolled by the Israeli owned Republican Party once again has convinced me that you are low quality people who need to be culled to avoid wasting the Earth’s precious oxygen.I find it especially humorous that the readership of this blog hasn’t realized that Zman sold all of you out.You figured out Trump’s treacherous nature during his first term, resolved to build alternative structures.  Then you went right back to the dog vomit of the Republican Party to get played again.Part of the Zionist plan that was put into action after 10-7 was to pay off prominent dissident “influencers” into once again supporting Trump.Zman took a cash payment from the people who hate you and want you dead to convince you to support the man who would give Israel the wars it wanted.You are all too stupid to live.My advice is for you to save yourself the suffering of being ruled by a foreign people.   Some things are worse than death.Take a gun, put it in your mouth, and to quote Zman “Pull your grief foward”

            Baked Beans – if that is indeed your name, and judging from your comment, it could very well be (after all, Frank Zappa named his kid ‘Moon Unit’, so these things happen) – you really need to get out more. Bird-watching is a terrific hobby, as is gardening, or collecting stamps, or learning how to bake bread. You are sad and depraved, and it’s a shame because life can be quite enjoyable. I wish you well in your quest to find something, other than fantasies of human bloodshed, to make your life worth living.
