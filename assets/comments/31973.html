        A real upside to these judicial clown shows has been to reveal the American legal system as the vulgar and corrupt disgrace it is. Just as Normie clung to Muh Military until it became a trainwreck consumed in a dumpster fire (and, yes, many still do so albeit tenuously), there was an undue religious faith placed in the legal system. That too is ending quite rapidly. Rule by brute force has been the coin of the realm at least since Trump descended on the escalator and said bad, horrible, and true things about the United States. This will get worse and more onerous, but it should be welcomed because it is requisite to actual change and full-on dissolution.The Republican Party likely is dead at the national level at this point, so it has nothing to lose if it does dump Trump. We have nothing to gain if the GOP survives. As noted, the fig leaf of even faux democracy has been dropped to reveal a small, flaccid, syphilis-ridden penis of a nation. The totalitarianism is about to be dialed up to 11 and a war launched somehow, somewhere to try to regain some public buy-in on the farce of the GAE. It likely won’t work, but for some odd reason people still don’t jump bail for the most part, so hope springs eternal.The downside, as always, is the clowns running these transparent shitshows also have control of nuclear weapons and very well may use them.

                “Sometimes wonder if that [nuclear war] would be worse…”
I last read seriously about nuclear war when I was 12 (1962). Then I bought Anne Jacobson’s new book.
Pro tip: It hasn’t gotten better in the past 62 years. In fact, it’s gotten a lot worse. Eating rats in the basement while being shelled is better – a lot better.
So is what we have.

            And yet it’s entirely possible the SC will pick Trump’s chestnuts from the fire and allow him to at least appear on the general election ballot, at which point he’ll be cheated out of his victory again. The SC, despite the presence of a few diversifreaks, has shown a nasty streak of independence from the power structure and the ability to conduct its business fairly rationally.

                The “nasty streak of independence” emerged only after the justices realized they are targets and will remain so for the rest of their lives, even the uber cucks. If they were to be convinced, delusionally, that they no longer are doomed, they would revert to form.

                            Guys like Thomas and Alito had religion long before the mobs formed. What’s more, logically, the threat of violence would compel justices to behave irrationally not rationally. That is the purpose of attempted intimidation.

                                I will give you Alito and Thomas. Obama criticized the former to his face during the SOTU address and Roberts said nothing. He did, of course, respond when Trump referred to “Obama judges.” Threats of violence focus the mind on self-preservation rather than virtue-signaling, and that’s what is playing out with the others. It is totally rational.

                                    But for public figures, virtue signaling IS self preservation. To do otherwise is to court–so to speak–misery.

                                        They have figured out virtue-signaling will not save them now. The Regime, taking its cue from its dominant/near-dominant Tribal faction, never forgives and always seeks revenge, even when doing so is counter-productive. When Garland refused to protect the justices from the SJW terrorists, they apparently understood virtue-signaling is insufficient. The “nasty streak of independence” you earlier referenced is an acknowledgement of this. Green shoot there, maybe.

                                            Well, if you’re screwed no matter what you do, then you would presumably just stick to your guns. In other words, attempts at intimidation should logically have no effect whatsoever.
It seems to me this is an Occam’s razor situation. The streak of independence is simply a case of several SC justices not yet being absorbed into the power structure.

                Trump has an outstanding record in cases before the SC. So, you may well be right.  I think they’ll try to delay trials and bog things down rather than create new precedent.  They hate new precedent.Early Lawfare efforts in 2017/18 consisted of filing waves of lawsuits to block Trump on things like the stay in Mexico policy, the pipelines, etc.  Those all failed at the high court.  They slowed him down for a couple of years, but they were unable to stop him in the end.Biden is doing so badly that there might not be enough ballots to print to save the regime.  Trump’s polling has been terrific and he’ll expand on that lead after the conventions.  Democrats are running out of time to replace Biden without crowning a designated loser.  There is no “savior” candidate in the enemy’s camp.  Whoever replaces Biden runs on Biden’s record.  The people named as Biden replacements want Bidenx1000 policies in Ukraine and some of them (Newsom) ran police states during COVID.

                I agree and frequently use the term delegitimize.  That’s what the Zero GOP effort is about.  Sure, destroying them would be fun.  But what it really does is remove the legitimacy of the regime by refusing to participate in a scam.

            Yes, the (misplaced) mainstream faith in our legal system has been torn to shreds…As an attorney, I would add that in many States, the non-political cases heard by lower level courts (or preferably arbitrators) are mostly legit, although these courts are often staffed by political hacks…

                As a non-attorney, my guess is vanishingly few are legit. The courts long ago set the standard of violation of a legal right, harm and redressability, yet most tend to lack one or both of the first, and, with administrative law, none of it is legit.
For example, if you cannot find a single person who was harmed by another’s refusal to wear a seat belt, you do not have a justicible case. All such not thrown out are unjust.

        Off topic—I’m back in the States after several months abroad. Depressing. It hit me as soon as I got to the airport and congregated with the other Americans boarding. Large and rotund people shambling about. I had been in a sea of relatively fit people and in places where women were somewhere between average and stunningly hot for the most part for many months.Once I got Stateside I was greeted by the sullen grumpy faces of minorities again. Looking at you as if they are doing you a favor for doing the jobs they are paid for. This did not occur in the hinterlands of Europe (think East and South). Resting bitch face, major attitude. “Fuck you Whitey” sitting right behind the eyeballs.A sea of unhappy brown faces. Up until yesterday I could count “diversity” encounters in the past 90 days on my hands. Mercifully, I should be back out of this sewer in a few months. No offense to my fellow sewer dwellers! Not talking about you…TV full of black faces, if I was a foreigner or a space alien who knew nothing about the States I would assume the country is at least 50-70% black. It is blackety black on TV 24x7x365. I saw I think one black face in a TV commercial the 90 days prior.All your democrat voting Whites are totally fine with this egregious marginalization, it makes me sad. But I’m very close to having a 2nd passport so “not my problem” is starting to be part of my vocabulary. I cannot fix a hundred million people unfortunately.

            I’d like to hear more about where you went and whether you plan to go back. I get downvoted around here a lot for suggesting that the best course for most of us is to emigrate as soon as practicable. I’ve been looking at Argentina or maybe some places in Asia, but parts of Europe could be interesting.

                If you are being persecuted, you have no property and no family here, then leaving may be a good option.For the rest, if you can acquire land/property and put it to use in service of our people here, that is the best thing to do or to work on homeschooling or local American/European civics education. Even if you get one person to the cultural life boat, it is worth it.If we just leave, we forfeit. Now is the time to dig in roots, but of course dig them in where they are safer on a relative basis. I am in favor of the attitude that this is Our land and it is Our former country that Our posterity is going to reclaim, reconquer and fix. North America is a geographical paradise. Do not forfeit that lightly. This will be a war of attritionI am as sick of the constant glimpses of black super cops lecturing serial killer white guys in eubonics, the bizarre wilds of Africa models that pop up digitally … … …They are trying to get under your skin. This is relatively minor abuse. It sucks, but it shouldn’t chase us off Our land. Once you give up your land you never get it back. This is something the Romans did. They would never ever surrender no matter how dire the odds. After Hannibal at Cannae (sp?) they refused to surrender and overcame the odds to finally drive him out. We don’t know how long it will take, but never surrender.

                I get why people are conflicted. It does appear lame to simply leave, but either RealityRules (also commenting below) remembers my story or is simply intuitive. I had a -lot- of criminal charges slapped on me the last time I took the “stand &amp; fight” method in the DC area. My life was blown to pieces because they wanted to make it clear how easily they can do that for even perceived slights against the new god known as DEI. My situation warranted a very radical new start.In either case, whether you leave our shores or remain here, there -must- be a resorting. We cannot legally separate as they will never allow it but already the country is reorganizing itself along political lines, this will only accelerate. So as RealityRules noted, find someplace suitably far from diversity and get very involved in community building. Demographics is destiny, so you will NOT get this entire landmass without doing the dirty type of work no one wants to do, but you could carve out areas or even whole regions if people get serious.Picking up your life (even to Europe) is non-trivial so I want to be certain I make that clear. Particularly since the best places in Europe have rather poor English skills. This is why the poz has been resisted to a large degree. It is hard to broadcast propaganda across large communication barriers thankfully.If you do not have a remote type job, are in retirement, or basically have ‘fuck you money’ this is sort of a non-starter. For all the things about the US that suck, the salaries are unmatched. Period. Even in the big economies of Germany/UK they simply don’t match here. In the less powerful economies, US salaries are inconceivable. I never ever talked money with anyone as they either likely not believe you or simply rob you. These are places were practicing physicians make maybe $80-120k, MAX. If you told them that starting salaries for college grads is up to like 60-75K now they would think you are taking the piss. Language barrier is -real- and very challenging in many places. This type of travel is not for the faint of heart, you need to learn those 20-40 common phrases to navigate the environment.Now ALL those disclaimers out of the way. I started in &lt;i&gt;Italy, Croatia, Slovenia, Hungary (giga-based!), Slovakia, Poland&lt;/i&gt;, on this sweep was all I had time for. Italy was surprisingly based because Giorgia Meloni talks a good game I think, but like Trump in spite of some really good “Europa for Europeans” type rhetoric she took the ticket too from the EU. She has toned it down, but is still considered “right/far right” by the commies in the West. Poland unsurprisingly has started swallowing Western poison in the big cities. Smaller towns still very trad.The other ones in that list besides Italy/Poland are like the US was in probably the 1980s. And even in Italy/Poland if you are out of major cities the 1980s still applies. Gay jokes are common in public, everyone laughs, even the fags… In a smaller city, I saw a pic of a guy wearing blackface for a small theater play. No n-ggers available for the part, what are you gonna do? 🤷‍♂️The standard of living is lower though. This is why I’m happy most Americans are fat &amp; lazy, they would not tolerate not having everything at your fingertips 24×7. Amazon is slow, power / water occasionally goes off, pace of life is slower, services are less reliable, etc. things your average Fatmerican simply won’t tolerate. Keeps the Wokeys at bay though.

                    Swiss salaries generally match American or are even higher, but the cost of living is very high too and the whole country is one large HOA.Slovenia is one of the easier countries to adapt to for Americans – clean, well organized, generally nice people and not as poor are the other post-communist countries. It also has a cheap residency by investment program. The only downside is lack of a serious international airport and of some big city conveniences.Croatia, Hungary and Slovakia are “based”, but even there, the cities are seeing in influx of turd world invaders, especially over the past 6 to 9 months.Italy is mixed bag. It’s beautiful, but I wouldn’t live in any of their bigger cities.

                If you are young, yes. If you are raising a family or planning to, yes. If you are a fourth generation guy rooted in a region as I am (western NY), who knows the people, the towns, the geography, and the history as I do, this is where I will die. Emigration for me means retreat, and abandonment of what I love. Going to Argentina or Europe or Arkansas for that matter, would make me rootless and, well, pointless.

                I lived and worked in West Africa, a place once called the White Man’s grave mostly because of diseases like Malaria.
Now I find myself back home, a place which could even more aptly called The White Man’s grave. How many years before none of us are left? Not because of any disease, but due to suicide.

            Apex, I’ve had the same experience without leaving the country. I used to pheasant, grouse, quail and chukar hunt and it took me to the Great Plains, west Texas and the mountain and desert west. This was about 10 years ago before everything went to hell, but I still noticed in rural and small-town USA how you could go for an entire trip without seeing a dusky face. I didn’t so much notice at the time but on the way home and after getting home it was like I saw how much better life was in the places I had just left.

                Yep.
The next step is to improve on those places. They lack reasons for the youth to stay. Anyone who is retired, or close to retired, or even fairly well set can easily set up a business there whose sole point is to break even. If you aren’t pulling a salary, it’s easy to make pretty much anything work.
Not just for boomers. Even down into mid-millenials, maybe even later, for those who saved like mad.

                    All Jill Biden would have to do is slide a piece of paper in front of Joe and tell him to sign it.  On the paper?
“Jack Smith is fired.  The DOJ is ordered to drop all charges against PDJT.”
The Biden’s cannot be bought off on this one.  And they can do a lot of damage to Democrats if the Democrats try to remove him against the Biden Family’s wishes.

                Interestingly, Hillary is the only one who I could see pulling it off. Maybe she even keeps Kamala as VP. Sets up the Great Rematch with Trump, which all the Karens would love.
Her own health may not be good, but it’s got to be better than Biden’s.

                At this point, people are voting for the potted plant with D or R in front of it. Normie Dems vote for the same reason Normie Cons vote: at least X is not Y. Trump has transcended conservative politics because he is both R and treats the enemy like Rush Limbaugh did. All subsequent R candidates will have to be embodiments of aggressive conservative talk radio, or at least play assertive on TV while cucking behind closed doors.But just wait until the D’s find an alpha who’ll give R’s the business. There is probably one out there: comically left-wing but with a wit and charisma that attracts even right-of-center people.

            I think the replace-Biden thing has been discussed quite a lot on the D side.  They have multiple problems with that, not least of which is they have no viable candidates.  They tried putting Newsom on a stage with DeSantis which is like pitting two single-A baseball players against each other in a charity softball game.  Newsom really hasn’t been visible much since then.  If you can’t handle DeSantis, Trump will murder you.  Big Mike hates everything about this country, which conveniently includes all politicians as well, so she’s not going to do it.  That leaves…NOBODY!  They quite literally have no bench.Add to that the Biden Crime Family problem.  There are way too many people grifting off the Biden Profit Center to allow him to be pushed aside.  Look how long they kept DiFi alive just to milk that cow.  Just because Joe is a feeb doesn’t mean they Biden’s don’t have any power to refuse to step aside.  They can, simply, say “no thanks, we’re not doing it”.  If the Dems try it anyway, they risk having the Biden’s on TV campaigning for Trump just to get revenge.  All the cases against Trump get dropped, freeing him up 100% to campaign.The Bidens are crooks.  They will do whatever it takes to keep the spigot of money flowing into their family.

        There are more things to consider than just the political situation in the coming months. Who knows, maybe the silos get flushed in the near future due to overwhelming incompetence of our so called world leaders.

                I’m on team everything is happening, but is in such slow motion that it doesn’t look like it is. As a GenX’er like the Zman, I grew up with end of the world scenarios in which everything was fine at 8AM, but by 5PM it was live-action Mad Max. “The Morning After” and “Threads” and all that. But it seems like instead, we’re on the slow boat to chaos, with plenty of ups and downs, false starts, recoveries and slumps along the way. But the trend line is clear – every step forward ends up in two steps back.Bob Grant was right all along – we are slipping and sliding into Third Worldism.

                    Yes. A case in point is the ongoing Great Resorting. The United States is fragmenting and dissolving slowly as populations move to more compatible areas, governors distance themselves from D.C., and so forth. Until recently that has been glacial. It picked up with Covid, but it is one of many things underway that is so slow it is difficult to appreciate the significance.

                    The upside to that is that Third World reality means the BFE will no longer have the technological wherewithal to annihilate all life on the planet. The catch, of course, is that technological degradation must outpace elite descent into madness. I’m not confident that will happen.

        The Big Picture.The end game is the imposition of a techno-tyranny. It was on schedule until Trump won in 2016, and now it’s been accelerated due to his continued popularity. Which is where the problem arises for the Deep State. They were counting on a slow boil to keep the transition violence to a minimum, and now it must get messy (and iffy). The jackboot corps is not yet in place as Congress has yet to absorb the illegals into the military and Federal police. And when the 2024 election is obviously stolen, a lot of real insurrection is going to be spawned. A few of the Southern states are going to try to soften this movement by feigning faux secession activities, but the wildcard is what happens with the Ukraine war and BRICS. Either could trigger a fast economic collapse of the West.And when a large cohort of the US population goes 3 days without a meal, it will get very unpredictable very fast. The Republicans replaced the Whigs. What will replace the Republicans?

Islamocrats. Keep an eye on Michigan and Minnesota where it’s already happening. The UK is even more advanced. North Africa and the Anatolian peninsula are centuries farther ahead.

                Don’t forget Cartel along the border states. They are professional, organized, wealthy, and handmaidens to both the governments and the banks.
On the bright side are small White movements such as the Southern Christian Patriots, Mormon Natalists, and Christian Nationalists, as well as organic markets like the preppers and off-grid. Those are budding attempts by whites to organize in preparation.
The independent livestock, farm, and trade associations too, as nationally organized with a long history. There is where I see the most well-developed potential of “by us, for us.” And I must recognize the efforts by local political orgs.

                Yes indeed. The University system in particular is in for a big bubble burst. Many of those bloated institutions of pure indoctrination are going to go bankrupt when enrollment craters. And who is going to buy those Treasury bonds when the dollar is usurped by a new BRICS currency backed by gold? There’s a lot of repressed anger boiling under the surface, and when it releases, it’s not going to be pretty.

            The closest comparison to 2024 is 1860. Lincoln wasn’t on the ballot in many Southern states (sound familiar to CO, ME, and other states that tried to remove Trump?). He won the EC and the South seceded.The most likely outcome of 2024 is Trump wins, and the US Government secedes along with NY, WA, OR, CA, IL and some other deep blue states. IOW, the bureaucracy refuses to obey the President. States declare their independence. CA signs a mutual defense treaty with China in exchange for basing rights in San Diego, LA, and SFO.Trump winning in 2024 is the easy part. It’s what comes next, and what it will require, that is going to be hard. What happens in a country where the bureaucracy simply decides to disobey the Chief Executive?  e.g., Trump fires somebody, and the guy keeps coming to work because nobody in the State Department will obey the firing. So Trump fires more people, and that’s disobeyed, too.I called 2017 a “Government Party Civil War”. Nothing has changed my mind about this. The Government Party will secede and make Trump try to be President without any government agencies listening to him. Trump will then need to call up the Guard/Military and hope they’ll drag government employees out of their offices to be replaced by…someone?This is going to be a hell of a year.

        Trump buying pizza for the police who’ll soon murder him was a fun episode of Regime TV. His arc is about to end with an Our Democracy-saving courthouse “scuffle.” Will the cop who shoots him will be the next mayor of New York? Governor? King? Tune in!The Republicans’ preparation for Trump’s removal has been to guarantee that in his absence they’ll lose everything. They’re out there killing puppies, passing hate speech laws, sending in the troops against teenage girls, calling their voters losers, letting secret cities of “migrants” be built in their states, etc. Every day a new horror. “Zero seats” istheirplan, the end of any pretense of opposition.Good times.

                The USSR had a couple of older stars take office and promptly die.  This gave impetus for the Central Committee to nominate a relative youngster, Gorbachev.  Similar thing happen in the Catholic Church with John Paul II taking the papacy.

        No one thinks Trump is on it?  In some way ?  Or it is not what it appears to be?Back in the day I was talking with my dad about Obama, and it came to me that no great country would ever have Obama as president.  So we backed into the conclusion, oh geez, then maybe we aren’t a great country.  Time has certainly borne this out, and Obama was a symptom or manifestation of its decline.But aside from that, a similar logic might apply here.  Everyone is saying that no man could ever endure what Trump is enduring.  All the lawsuits, dragging into court, fines, the government hounding him non-stop.  On and on and on.This is all too much for any one man to endure.Ok, so no man could ever endure this.  But certainly a man could endure a charade.

                We’re not dismissing him as controlled opposition. We’re asking why he’s been allowed to get this far given his apparent nature as HitlerStalinFrancoMussoliniSatan to the governing class of the US and the world.Heritage Foundation and hundreds of current and former GOP Hill staffers, lobbyists, and consultants are busy preparing for Trump’s presidency as we speak. Legislation is being drawn up, transition teams chosen — very little reporting is being done on this in conservative circles, to give the impression that he’s the Lone Gunman once again. But he’s not.If the guy were truly a pariah and truly seeking to bring it all down, bought-and-paid types like Marco Rubio and Tim Scott wouldn’t be 50% of his potential VP picks. Trump is not what they’re selling him as, either to you or to the MSNBC crowd.

                Whoever said anything about “controlled opposition” ?That was not even implied.  What’s implied is that it might not be as it seems since the odds of any one man being able to endure that are pretty close to zero.Unless Trump is a one in a billion type of superstar.  That’s what we are left to conclude.  That he is a man of the ages who stood up to the largest government machine in the history of man and won.I think Trump is certainly a special person, but I do not think he is a man for the ages.  Hence I am looking at all of this with some skepticism.

            Trump was born in 1946, the first of the Boomers, and he retains faith in the system. He remains very much a Normie despite his wealth and fame. There are millions like him, and that trust is endearing even if wildly misplaced.In other words, he’s not “in on it.” My main concern is if the actual TPTB allow him to return to office, they will use him as a Judas goat to try to lure young white men back into military service, lull normal people back to sleep, and to be left holding the bag when they implode the economy. The only way he is allowed back, which I doubt happens, is to be a fall guy.

            This judge in New York, he’s been an “acting judge” since 2009. Trump repeatedly refers to this as a “fake trial.” And it appears the other trials will not conclude before the election.It’s absolutely possible Trump is in on this. The foremost reason I have for this belief is that if Trump were a mortal danger to the DC class, he would have been eliminated sometime in 2021 when his star was at its nadir and the country was still consumed with vaccine fever. That he’s been allowed this far — very far, for Hitler Part Two — should raise doubts.

            It certainly cannot be ruled out.  For all of the cloud people hate against Trump, one thing is certain.   When Netanyahu tells Trump to jump, he will respond: How high?

                        I read an interview with the then-president of Exxon.  He happened to be Mexican-American, so at that time he had almost certainly earned his way up.
He dealt with the most venal, corrupt people in power all over the world.  One just learns to ignore whatever the local issues are and get on with business.
I’m certain a Reagan Democrat like Trump- that’s the New York attitude- sees things the same way.  What we continually forget to remember is the difference between Trump the man and Trump the symbol.

                            I plan on voting for Trump the symbol. If he’s not on the ballot I’ll write him in. Hell, just to sow chaos, I may write him in for multiple offices. Perhaps others will do the same. Will Trump end up as Sheriff, Dogcatcher, and state senator in 37 different places? We can only hope. There’s never been a better way to vote “no confidence” for the entire political establishment. I think Z was talking about this in the show last Friday. What if Trump wins the election but the overall Republican Party implodes? It’s not just “popcorn time” but might well be the end of the political system as we’ve known it.

        The solution to the Biden problem is to remove him from the ballot at the convention and swap in someone new.It’s even worse. They’re stuck with Biden. Harris isn’t going quietly. She hasn’t come this far to let her ambition be thwarted, inches from the throne. Her faction knows all precedent and custom demand the VP take top slot if Biden “steps aside for the good of the nation.” The fight to remove her could make factional rivalry in DC explode.

            All it would take is for Jill Biden to whisper, “Say, ‘no thank-you’,” in Joe’s ear and the convention descends into anarchy. The thing consistently showing up in polls is that Trump is the Return to Normalcy candidate, believe it or not.  And, he’s viewed as the successful President of the two.  Imagine that.
I agree, they’re stuck with Biden.  RFK Jr. is the mule to siphon votes from Biden which makes the vote rigging harder to pull off.  You need millions of legitimate votes to camouflage the fake votes.

        The problem with Trump is he doesn’t want to govern. The man is not interested in legislation or advancing an agenda. He merely likes to be called Mr. President and play golf.Remember he added $8 Trillion to the debt and refuses to cut spending. His leadership during Covid was awful. He allowed the states to lock us down. He did nothing during the riots.The reality is he tells the MAGA supporters what they want to hear. He doesn’t actual care about regular people. Look at the people at his private clubs, they don’t look like the people at a Trump Rally.

                The first thing anyone like Adams needs to do is apologize for being wrong his whole goddamn life about immigration.I worked in immigration reform for 20 years, and was on the Buchanan campaign as a volunteer in 1992 and a staffer in 1996. In the 1990s we got a more honest hearing from liberals on the issue of immigration than conservatives, who were still dumping tons of dirt on Buchanan’s political grave for being “racist” and “xenophobic” and “anti-Semitic.”I don’t care any longer. I put up with decades of abuse from white guys like Adams for fighting for their future. Once in a while some hardhat-type dude would even get in my face because “muh son-in-law’s a Hispanic” or something like that. That was my experience with whites and immigration when it actually mattered.Now Adams is “right” again about something (in his head), so it’s not like he’s suddenly amenable to reason or persuasion from others — he’s just as arrogant and solipsistic as most middle-class whites over the past three decades. Whatever solution they come up to this will almost certainly involve putting people like me in my place first anyway before they get to the illegals — you know, to show theirbona fidesto liberals that they’re not racist like us — so why bother.

        While I wait for approval, the issue that should concern power players and us is “what comes after” Trump in jail and removed from the ballot, or worse?Do we get the trial-ballooned draft and wartime production draft? Do we get reparations? Do we get CBDC? Strict rationing? Illegal aliens as impressment gangs per Ukraine’s roving teams dragging men off the street?Populations will put up with stuff … until suddenly they won’t. Usually rulers don’t see that coming. The Regime is dangerous because they have only one speed and direction. They don’t take feedback and have already thrown away all limits.I figure that the stuff used against Trump will be weaponized against the great mass of his supporters after November one way or another. Both James and Bragg can use this method to mass prosecute anyone with a car loan, home loan, that was likely a Trump supporter and did business with a New York company that issued loans to basically take all their property. Why not? They can distribute the proceeds to cronies and enrich themselves and who will say no?The same thing for Reparations. You as a White man now owe the Government $2 million a year (like 19th Century Draft Exemptions during the Civil War). Pay up or go to the Russian Front or work in an arms factory for nothing.There is no stop. No way for the Regime to not escalate further against its enemies who are Straight White males (and sometimes not even being not-straight is not enough to avoid the enemy label).In my view the most likely action will be what we saw in Ukraine and Russia. No mass protests that shake the Regime. Just mass exodus of White guys. Bringing massive systems collapse as the DEIversity Crowd cannot manage. Mass ordinary people mobility is a sword that cuts two ways.

            The regime has a massive white person problem. Regardless of overall percentage or immigration, there are 200 million white people in the United States of Germanic descent. More white people of Spanish &amp; Portuguese descent classified as Hispanic.Contrary to their idealized world of TV commercials, we aren’t going anywhere. And that’s a huge issue for them. Even at the current rate of decline with interracial marriages, low birth rates, and opioid deaths, there will still be what, 120 million white Americans by 2100?We aren’t illiterate, helpless Russian peasants like in the Bolshevik Revolution. We aren’t like modern Ukrainians, blindly nationalistic and desperate for Western approval.What happens when we just say no, and walk away?

        I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. Trump is the best president we’ve had since Eisenhower, and for pretty much the same reason (political outsider, used to wrestling with scumbags). Now that is less a ringing endorsement of Trump, then a severe condemnation of the clowns who have been presidents in the interim.As to the coming chaos: we could be at one of those moments in history where everything hinges on the most unimaginable set of circumstances. Vary just a little bit one way, it’s to the ruin of all; the other way, a new flowering of humanity.Or maybe just nothing happens at all, like Zman says. Same crap, same boss.

                Reagan is number 3 due primarily for getting taken for a ride on the amnesty issue. Now Trump also got taken for a helluva ride on the Covid scam, but his performance as the opposition the last few years makes it look like he may have learned a lesson. If he wins, his subsequent actions will show one way or the other.

                    Winning is the easy part.  It’s what comes next that is going to be hard. At the time, I called early 2017 a “Government Party Civil War” because you had the US Government (Trump’s employees, basically) in open political warfare trying to overturn the election results.If Trump prevails in 2024, you’re going to see the US Government (in the form of bureaucrats) secede from the country.  They will simply refuse to comply.The question for Trump is “What are you prepared to do?”  Because he’s going to have to gut the Government like a bonefish with a dull knife.I’ve seen some interviews where Trump tacitly admits that if he wins there’s GOING to be a civil war.  Last time we had a civil war (Floyd riots), Trump tried not to make more enemies.  This time around, he’s going to have to search and destroy enemies.He will be our next, true, wartime president.  But it will be a war against the Federal Bureaucracy.

                In addition to Reagan’s amnesty of illegals, he also appointed Neoconservative William Bennett to Secretary of Education over the guy the Paleocons supported, Mel Bradford.  This was a key moment for the Neocons taking over the Republican party.  Reagan let them get a foothold that increased when Bush Sr. took office.

        Scott Adams seems really upset about the conservatives.  Once again the Republicans managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.

To me, looking at ol’ Dilbert is like looking in the mirror. I used to be nice to blacks, smile and believe in the judeochristian narrative and one day I got mugged by reality and my world turned upside down. Once you see the matrix, you can’t unsee it.

        The argument that Trump has to important Wall Street people, such as JPM’s Dimon, whoever runs things at Berkshire Hathaway, Bill Ackman, Daniel Loeb etc. is that he is a reformer capable of putting a blanket on the chaos that threatens them.A Wartime footing would destroy all the investments in consumer goods, as well as Chinese investments going to zero, as well as everyone not named BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard seeing their portfolios/wealth/power evaporate. Along with pressure from the Gaza brigade / Soros / State / CIA against them. The “Fancy” group like Larry Fink has no worries, no matter how rich and powerful Bill Ackman gets he will never be “Fancy” and tied into Soros/Schwab/the CIA etc.This is also the argument he is making to elements of the Pentagon, particularly the Navy and Air Force, that he would be Reagan-esque: avoiding escalating direct conflict while building up domestically the Navy and Air Force with domestic employment and suppliers.Trump’s argument to elements within the Regime is this: They know what they will get with Biden. Even MOAR of the same: more Gazan mobs screaming at ((())), more escalation to troops with Russia, more escalation with carriers sunk with China, full Wartime rule which ruins most investments and solidifying power with the Davos club. Its not just “us” but significant power players who are limited upwards and angry with the Robespierre direction of the Regime. I don’t know to what extent people within the Regime are willing to buy this, but his first term made a lot of powerful people lots of money and Biden’s term has made them poorer.

            A Whiskey comment with a touch of optimism.  I never!You give too much credit to the elites:  It’s too fashionable to hate Trump and they despise the dirt people too much to act in their own self interest.  Besides, all the Deep State government stooges will never, never allow Trump to be a position to push their fat worthless asses away from the trough.All those monied interests may be able to buy off congressmen and maybe the secretaries of some minor executive departments, but they will never pry the snouts of the Deep State and bureaucracy away from the feed trough.

                I think it’s more of a question of whether some portion of the (((deep state))) wants to make a deal with Trump to save themselves, while keeping their nose in the trough
Really, you’d think they would have thought of it earlier. I believe Ukraine was the reason they didn’t. But perhaps now that they are seeing that victory is unattainable…..

                The plan Trump seems to offer is to get out of the escalation pattern with Putin / Ukraine and fall back. This allows the MiC to make money without risk that they would get with what amounts to a very hot war with Russia and China.The problem the elites have is constant escalation with both Russia and China who are NOT Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, or other shambolic pretend opponents. Both nations can reach out and touch the MiC easily. Including various people within it.In that sense Trump is the retreat to stability and the old system. Conflict does not go away but it gets managed. Unlike the senile current regime which offers just more and more escalation with dangerous nations who see the conflict as a matter of survival.

        It seems reasonable to assume getting rid of Trump is a genuine priority of the regime. The incompetence of the regime people against Trump is therefore very informative. It means we can expect any crazy thing to happen. This includes the economy, war with Russia or China and other extremely dangerous things, nuclear power plants, novel design viruses, you name it. They are conceited, arrogant and incompetent and are playing with history s most dangerous toys. It’s a helluva time to be alive. Have a plan for almost anything

        The question is: what will all those Trump flag-displaying people (and there are a lot, at least where I live) do when their man goes into confinement? I think the fate of the country, in many ways, rests on that. If the MAGA crowd, with all their guns and tactical gear, just vents on Twitter about it, then the Regime has won, and the Regime will have all the more confidence to roll the citizenry as they’ve been doing. MAGA folks are not my people, but they will be the front lines, if one ever forms up.

                I think they fantasize about “it” all the time. There is a lot of anger out there. On both sides, but MAGA guys can live off the grid about 1 week longer than progressives can.But when the Regime dares Trump fanboys to square up and fight for their man, nothing will happen. Hopefully – and this is probably the best course of action, long-term – conservative voters will quietly quit. I would like to see Republicans get trounced by Democrats until the Dems have a super-majority, but there are enough retards that we’ll have this stupid kabuki theater for a long while still. Just look at the NFL – still popular, despite begging people to stop watching it.

            They will do exactly what all conservatives do.  They will complain online, eat their chips and turn the grill on.  Then be sure to vote even harder the next time.
a close friend, who is an evangelical conservative, tried explaining to me that the pendulum will swing back soon.  He really believes this.  He believes that “even dems think the transgenderism is crazy”.  Imagine believing things like this….

                    The same question could be turned around on you: What are YOU going to do about it? That question could then be turned around on me. I won’t hesitate to answer it: I won’t be doing anything, as one guy rebelling on his own won’t make an ounce of difference. We lack sufficient real-life organization to offer even a hint of a viable opposition.

                        Maybe, but there’s no reason you can’t do the only thing that will make a difference — get out of the city, move somewhere you aren’t outnumbered, start a business of some sort, and hire some white boys so they can start a family.

            There was a long lead up to 1775 people tend to forget about. Boston Tea party comes to mind. The massive smuggling to circumvent British restrictions on commerce is another. If any reaction happens to Trump being put in jail I think you will see it start with deplorables throwing sand into the gears any way they can. We’ve already seen this elsewhere with that hate speech law in Scotland where they flooded the report system with so many BS reports as to make it useless. People don’t go from zero to Lexington and Concord overnight.

                    The Muslim anti White minister is resigning. Will probably be replaced with someone worse. They probably won’t repeal the law either. But the British didn’t back down either and it finally led to the American war of independence. I don’t think our current elites will back down. By now I’m about sure that’s for the best. They need replacement not reforming.

            and tactical gearMost of their camo is field camo. This betrays their essential passivity and cluelessness. They fantasize about a civil war which the regime would win in the sticks, where the rebels would be finished off, but the rebels must win in the cities, where the regime would be finished off and replaced.The rebels are also still stuck in the American politics of the late 18th century. They would fight to reboot a major error of the “Englightenment”, and most of them are zombies of Zion, too. It’s difficult to imagine rebels more doomed to fail should they decide not to roll over in submission and go back to sleep.

            “but they will be the front lines, if one ever forms up.”‘Front Lines’ requires a general and an army with a strategy.A bunch of grillers with guns doth not an effective fighting force make.Nothing will happen. Period. The few that tried to play Billy Bad Ass are already doing hard time for basically -nothing-. See: Proud Boys. See: Oath Keepers See: 3% PatriotsAnd every other org that preaches patriotism and being well armed. Sort of like the KKK rally joke, if there are 5 people in attendance its 4 feds and one dupe.The men who can actually effect change that have the ways &amp; means and the know-how are too well situated and enmeshed in the system. Elon Musk, et.al. They play at revolutionary now and again with strong language but they won’t be spitting on their hands anytime soon and hoisting the black flag. FAR too lucrative to go along to get along still. Sorry…

            JFK Jr will be ignored to death. If we actually did have a free and open press, and political parties that responded to their bases, JFK Jr would be way ahead of Biden. Ramaswamy and Tulsi Gabbard would be ahead of Biden. The only guy who could beat Trump, in a fair election, is Kennedy. Just like Bernie Sanders could have beaten Trump in ’16.Problem is that Kennedy is a civil yesterday-man fringe candidate (Lyndon LaRouche, Ralph Nader, Ron Paul) and doesn’t pick fights like Trump…he does the “win the battlefield of ideas” thing that is a loser’s gambit. And too many Dem voters are turned off by Kennedy’s Covid trutherism.

            It’s very timely that all of a sudden RFK jr now wants to debate Trump and he wants the subject of that debate to be covid and what Trump did and failed to do during that period.I was reading an article recently and it mentioned how the money people behind DeSantis have begun to move towards RFK jr. Once again, impeccable timing and depending on how this goes, this may very well peel some support away from Trump. Covid is a subject that people of all stripes are still livid over.

            I think RFK is friends with Trump.  I suspect RFK is the mule, and his job is to siphon enough votes from Biden to make election fraud impossible.  Trump will attack RFK to make him more appealing to DEMOCRATS as a viable option.  They already hate Biden and will never vote for Trump.  So, give them a “Liberal” option.All the talk early on was that RFK would hurt Trump.  I’ve never bought into that and the polls so far have supported my theory.  If RFK is an op against Trump, it’s being run by the same stupid “influencers” brought on to secure a DeSantis primary victory.

        I don’t think Biden is going to step aside. He doesn’t need to. He is totally stage managed and the media will operate his campaign for him. I think there is zero chance we have debates. Even if Trump is still a free man, Karine Jean-Pierre will open up her tome and flip to the page where it says that “Biden feels debating Orange Man Bad is beneath the dignity of the office” and the media will cheer. The media is not going to report on anything Trump the candidate does or says – they did this to some extent in 2020, but they are just going to ignore him entirely. It wouldn’t surprise me if they don’t even have a reporter on the Trump beat (again, presuming he is a free man). If you were to watch MSNBC in a bubble, you might not even realize Trump is a nominee for president.I still think that odds are good that Trump does not assume office no matter what happens in the election. Even if Trump dominates the election, I could easily see Congress stepping in and… refusing to certify the election and declaring Brandon the winner! Yes, it is in contravention of the law they passed and everything they have done and said since 2020, but who cares? “It’s okay when we do it.”

            One thing not mentioned is the upcoming certainty of anti-Israel protests at the Democratic national convention. This would give the powers that be the chance to remove Biden from office for someone else (no idea who that might be).  So, Zman talking about the chaos option occurring at the convention isn’t as far-fetched as some might think.

                    Fun tidbits about the convention venues: Secondary business will be held at McCormick Place on the lakeshore southeast of the Loop, but the main venue is the United Center, located one block north of Malcom X College, and much farther from the hotels. The college is basically just across the street and separated from the UC by a parking lot. I expect the school to become a command center for protests and riots, so the cops will be pressured to shut it down and drive out the protestors. If they try, this convention quickly becomes like1968’s all over again, except for the more volatile political situation domestically and internationally. If the cops don’t shut down Malcolm X, the UC becomes unusable and the most important convention business has to be shifted to McCormick or other venues.Also noteworthy is the location of Union Park just a few blocks to the northeast of the UC. Numerous labor unions and union locals have their offices in the area. Now imagine DJT showing up to shake hands in the street with union laborers on the D’s own turf and to scold the D’s about not being enthusiastic enough for Israel.

                Subtle marker of decline: In ’68 Esquire sent Jean Genet and William Burroughs out to report on the planned riots at the Democratic convention. Our nearest literary figures are Houllebecq and Bronze Age Pervert. Not only is that a big step down in artistic seriousness, but no U.S. “men’s magazine” has ever mentioned either of them, because men’s magazines aren’t made by or for men anymore—not even gay men (who’ve degenerated into illiteracy). What retarded regime asset would 2024 Esquire send? Carlos Maza? Taylor Lorenz?Oddity spotted while looking forHoullebecq coverage in French men’s magazines: They seem to have stopped mentioninghim in 2015. That’s also the year Playboy announced they’d stop showing naked girls. Detrumpification without Trump.

                Trump is seen as the “return to normalcy” candidate.  If the Democrats let their convention become 1968, Trump will peel off even more voters. He doesn’t even have to make pro Israel statements (though he probably will).  All he has to say is “none of this happened and would no have happened had you not allowed the election fraud in 2020 to stand”.  People had Biden imposed on them, and now they’re getting front row seats to a catastrophe of global proportions.
Again, “replacing Biden” implies they have somebody to replace him with.  Harris?  Newsome?  Lol.

        It’s a strange condition where both major parties are likely hoping for their candidate’s physical demise. The GOP for obvious reasons, but the Democrats would likely conclude that the subsequent wave of sympathy would be enough to temporarily cover for Veep-Throat’s latent awfulness.The democrats are absolutely shackled by Veep Throat. Whoever decided to put her on the ticket was either very savvy, or very fortunate (my guess is “doctor” Jill biden) since there is absolutely no way to send FJB off to pasture without elevating her. No matter how awful she is, the democrats just cannot turn their back on this heir apparent without their Natives losing their minds, likely publicly. And for most democrats, tactical thinking in this case just cannot overcome their deeply held ideological beliefs.

        It’s a mortal lock that he won’t be acquitted. But I wouldn’t call conviction a mortal lock. There’s some percentage chance of a hung jury. Which will be higher or lower depending on the amount of jury intimidation. In that scenario I’d expect Bragg to move immediately to retry.It’s impossible to find anyone who has gone after Trump honestly. Whatever the latest media smear or lawfare prosecution, some percentage of it is always lies. Jack Smith proves this yet again. It’s an incredible phenomenon really, when you think about it.I’ve always said that she lost 2016 more than he won it. Even her supporters didn’t like her. Nobody does.

        Mundane take on all this: Trump will be nominated, and Trump will lose. Certainly, to use Z’s terminology, all the important places are now fortified for democracy.Admittedly, this could take an interesting turn if he is jailed, but I think they will wait to lock him up (not out of planning, simply Jarndyce v.

            I’ve commented here on this problem with machinists before. Starting with my generation (somewhat early X), absolutely nobody was pushing teens to going into various manufacturing specialties like machining.The way to become a tool and die maker (in the past, like my father’s generation and before) was to get a job out of high school at a machine shop. If you had the aptitude and work ethic in 20 years you could be a tool and die maker. But absolutely nobody in my generation that I knew though there was ever a chance you get a job somewhere and then work there “forever.”Maybe in certain locales this still existed, but not in Philly.Then there is the problem with automotive and many other fields which is nothing is repairable because the American and Dollar based repair is too much money compared to the foreign labor and currency for a new one. For the price it would cost to get a block and heads machined properly and rebuilt back into an engine, you could just buy a new engine. This is true of most things in America. It’s just cheaper to throw the old one away and buy a new one.

        Can you explain why William Weld could have become a national force in politics?  I only saw his later career, but it is hard for me to understand how the rest of the nation accepts a liberal New England Brahim which he seemed like a fairly stereotypical example of.  Most people were repulsed by John Kerry when he ran in 2004, Weld doesn’t seem that different to me.

            In the 80’s and 90’s, that sort of libertarian style was at its peak. Weld had the media skills to sell it, even to a skeptical audience. He made the mistake of running for Senate against Kerry. That was the end of his career.

                I was working on Capitol Hill in the mid-1980s when William Weld was an assistant attorney general looking at some defense contractor issues during the Reagan Administration.  I remember his testimony before the Energy and Commerce Committee in which he said, perceptively, that it was difficult to prosecute defense contractor misconduct because so often the military services were complicit in the misconduct/fraud.  He said that you either had to prosecute the whole cabal as a criminal conspiracy, which was unattractive because many of the people involved had distinguished military careers and could plausibly claim that they were trying to improve national security, or prosecute only the contractor and face a defense that there was no fraud because the government knew all about what was going on.  Perceptive man!  He did become governor of Massachusetts, which is a pretty high station, but it appears that he is now a fringe figure.

                    As someone who works in the defense industry, I can vouch for that view of fraud. The problem is we allow flag officers to get hired by the very contractors bidding for contracts. The $90k bag of washers is a good example of this corruption.Every contract isn’t like this, but too many are.Another thing that causes the DOD to waste money is simple incompetence and a hide-bound devotion to a ridiculously bureaucratic procurement process.I was reading the other day that a single tire replacement (the maintenance crews don’t take off the tire off a rim, but source it as a complete unit) for a F-18 Super Hornet is nearly $100k a wheel. The Navy was patting itself on the back for coming up with a way to swap tires off the wheels that cost $300 per wheel.Another thing is the whole “Joint” infection that has gripped the Pentagon since the end of WWII. Before and during the war, the services had separate procurement processes, but now, it’s under one umbrella.Too many cooks in the kitchen and you get idiotic turd burgers like the Little Crappy Ship that can’t defend itself, much less other vessels, the Future Combat System land vehicle program that spent billions on nothing and countless other programs where they spent billions and received no hardware.

                        The problem is we allow flag officers to get hired by the very contractors bidding for contracts.Yeah, that’s a problem. The arrangement works like a kickback racket, but we can find a slew of other problems, too. Examples:(1) An imperialist mindset among the populace and ruling class(2) a militarist culture which resists correction(3) contracting by firms operated for profit(4) capitalist thirst, which is basically insatiable for revenue, esp. that delivered through the power of gun barrels, electrozappers, and handcuffs.(5) capitalist irresponsibility institutionalized through limited liability statutes(6) stock markets, which would shrivel without capitalist irresponsibility(7) government borrowing, which allows politicians to loot the treasury with reduced risk of tax revolt(8) employer withholding of taxes, which subverts leverage against politicians and capitalists(9) popular election, which motivates politicians to buy votes with government kickbacks(10) the entire Social Security racket, one of the greatest campaign finance and election rigging schemes ever devised(11) criminalization of sedition, which is very ironic in a empire with governments established through sedition, and(12) false universalist creeds such as Protestantism, Jewish Zionism, and “Enlightenment” egalitarianism.

        Trump has been a true benefit to us in one crucial way. His enemies have shown everyone how absolutely incompetent the Managerial Class is. From the very beginning they couldn’t help jumping on their wedding tackle, wearing cleats.Comey, Director of the FBI what a goof. He was so transparently suckered he’s all but disappeared. Mueller? Not much better, his rep went down in flames as well. Let alone all the dubious informant schemes. How’s that trust in the Feebs going guys?The hucksters at the CIA? Good grief, they couldn’t run an op if they had to. Now maybe good intel is coming in from the grunts at the pointy end, but the management can’t get past their Trump hate fetish to look at it.The CDC and NHS flushed all their credibility down the tubes during COVID to upstage him.To cap it all off the diversity hires and the so called best and brightest have shown themselves to be incapable of even pulling off the most minor of tasks. Gotta love it.As a slight modification of one of Reagan’s good ones. “I’m here from the government and I’m going to really screw this pooch.”

        “…we are most likely going to see a situation in which the Secret Service faces off with the State of New York about how to jail a former president.”Actually, the Secret Service may not be involved when Mr. Trump is eventually jailed. I haven’t checked on it recently, but a few weeks ago there was a proposal in Congress to deny the former president a Secret Service detail in the event he is convicted and imprisoned.He would also be unable to take his private security detail with him to jail. If he had better Mafia connections, he might be able to get Mob protection. I doubt the Aryan Nation will look all that favorably upon him.So he will be left to the mercy of the general prison population. I don’t know how they will regard him, but the “Niggas4Trump” phenomenon suggests that he might well be fairly popular among the largest ethnic subgroup in prison.As Mr. Trump himself likes to say: We’ll have to see what happens.

        Beautiful. Even our esteemed host gives credit to Trumps political strengths like him or not. This is called reasoned analysis. You put your feelings aside, and draw logical, accurate conclusions.This does not speak well for the 90%of the TDS suffering imbeciles of the commentariat.Trump puts anti white racism publicly on the table in a speech, making it now safe for the pansy asses to pick up the ball and make anti white hate a part of the public discussion. Instead of seeing that as a net positive, the TDS’ers start shitting in their diapers ala their president.Because they resent that it was Trump who said it.Trump 2024

            Credit where due – Trump has placed anti-White racism in discussion.  I guess that’s a start.  But he is also a solid zionist, which is the root cause of the anti-White racism to begin with.  Trump is playing to his strength – good instincts on where the political winds blow, in particular recognizing a large underserved constituency and courting it.His slogan should be “Better than Biden.”  It would be 100% true, even if he is only a smidgen better.

                    Sure, but frankly, calling them “retards” doesn’t exactly meet your own standard, does it?
I get that maybe you point out where they are wrong, but if you block them, are you ever going to have the chance to help them see the light?

                        Some people don’t see the light. If they generate huge amounts of dislikes, does that validate their presence?  I see no reason to necessarily ban them but my life would be better if I could simply *not* see their postings and ignore such threads as they create.
We all live in a bubble of sorts of our own making, but driving an audience out of your blog simply because of trolls seems counter productive.

                            I’m not advocating for that.  Each individual should be able to selectively apply an “ignore” to a user.  I’m not saying we should “ban” anyone.

        New-cue-lar… anyone remember that mispronunciation? I’m talking about that imbecile “Dubya.” And that was many years ago. It was also the seed of our current chaos. “Patriot Act” for God’s sake. Better hope there’s no new-cue-lar this summer.
Anyone who’s paying attention realizes how the English language is degenerating. Just part of the general collapse of our culture. Does anyone in England still speak or write proper English? In spite of our “college educated” people running around everywhere, the level of ignorance is appalling.

            OK, but I did have professors who pronounced it the same way when I was getting my certification. Sure, they were all East Coast, so maybe it’s a regional thing, though they did know their shit, even if they did pronounce stuff wrong…

        Trump was merely the best of a very bad lot of GOP candidates in 2016 and then had the luck to face the odious and complacent Hillary Clinton. He then got rolled by the Swamp he claimed to oppose, which cost him enough support so the Dems could cheat just enough to win (while Trump and the GOP sat on their hands and allowed the fix to be done). There is no reason to expect anything different in 2024.

            Trump beat what was, at the time, considered the cream of the crop and the best slate of GOP candidates in decades: Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker and many more.  And he crushed them like a grape in his fist.
Agree Clinton was complacent, but the point of elections is to try and root that out.  Yes, Trump got rolled.  He shoulda took my advice in January 2017 and handed out 100,000 pink slips.  He thought the Government would fall in line.  It didn’t.  The question for 2024 is whether he will go to war this time.

                It would be nigh impossible to fire 100,000 bureaucrats without a plan, and such a plan would be this:Every fired bureaucrat would be guaranteed his or her full wages and benefits until they reach retirement age and receive their full pension.On one condition: They never again involve themselves with any level of government or any industry they regulated or lobbying group associated with that industry. The vast majority of them would take the deal without a squawk. The few holdouts could be canned in the traditional manner.The economics are simple: the average government employee does damage to our economy, culture and personal freedom far beyond the cost of their maintenance. Sending them off at full salary would be a bargain.

my guess is he still thinks we need to get in some tough conservatives to beat back them socialists.  Last time I was at this event, they were talking about some woman politician and I said” I’ll never vote for a woman” shock , nervous laughter.

Fyi, check out the comments at Gateway Pundit. There is still much wailing about the communisms and the “RINO”, but there’s lots of overt anti-Republican denunciations, too. It looks like many are ready for GØP (Zero GOP).

        RealityRules: “Remember, Ukraine is going to fall and maybe this summer. When that happens add a lot more chaos to the melting pot.”
Aha!  Monday I asked (sleepily) if anyone knew about some big thing in July.I remembered what it was.
Ukraine will be admitted to NATO.  Scholz (Germany) has already pledged 35,000 troops, and Macron was hooting likewise about the 1500 French Foreign Legion already there.

        Are you…seriously still promoting Trump as some sort of opposition? Really? If you can’t see he’s in on the ruse by this point…
