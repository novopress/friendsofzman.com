        On the other hand, maybe high IQ doesn’t correlate with high wealth because at higher levels of IQ one can lead a fulfilling life without needing wealth.  You’re smart enough to say “I got a good life, I don’t need to hustle”.  Smart enough to say “what’s the use of working sixty-hour weeks to pay for the boat I never use?”  Smart enough to see the fun in reading an old book, as opposed to buying that boat because it’s the only idea of fun you have.***********You do make a good point about rich people paying to hang out with intellectuals.  That’s pretty much how most art prior to the 20th century got made–because some rich guy wanted to own A Painting By Michaelangelo, or wanted to let all his bros know that he was so rich he could have Bach write a whole symphony just for him.  It’s not like da Vinci did the Mona Lisa for kicks and it accidentally got famous.  The idea that an artist could have a paying careeron their ownis a very modern one–and, you’ll note, the people who’ve started paying for cultural experiences are the ones telling us that artistsshouldn’thave any expectation of making money beyond work-for-hire or the immediacy of performance.  (see: all the anticopyright zealots.)

        Well, Henry Ford became very rich after WWI and well before the 1970s; so did many others; look it up.As for IQ, it is mostly a measure of academic intelligence and does not have much to do with suceeding in life which is mostly determined by motivation, drive and common sense. There are many “geniuses” that are simply F’n clueless, and they flock together in academia and   government because in these two institutions very little of usefulness to the people need be produced and because they can live off the public dime.Most geniuses spend their time impressing other like minded, like thinking individuals, and produce nothing .

        “…but free money will run out one day and then we will see some fireworks.”
One day?Have you picked up a paper in the last six years?Look up The National Debt. NOW include unfunded liabilities. NOW include “free” health care. NOW include the REAL percentage of folks without a “regular” taxable income. Now estimate the number of US “economy”, and foreign “aid” dollars, that “recirculate” to foreign “interests”, by the forklift pallet load, with astonishingly ignorant frequency.Of course, (ie)The New York Times MAY present alternative “interpretation”, based on alternative “adjusted data”.

        The only thing I will say about successful, and therefore wealthy, people I have met along the way is that they were willing to work hard. The ones who can’t work may be able to scam some money out of others for a time (doing things like running away after selling ‘drugs’ that are almost pure white cleaning agents) or milking the benefits system. Milking until even the stupid government sees that they are being taxed themselves — not so worried about ordinary people — to pay for the grubby greed of the unemployed and unemployable.The old message of working to earn money is of course lost on large tracts of the population in our current culture, but free money will run out one day and then we will see some fireworks.

        According to a study, and a few studies have merit though it takes more work than it’s worth to dig looking for holes which is the best you can do because it is way, way too much effort to duplicate the results:
There is a tendency of higher IQ leading to higher economic success until the very highest IQ’s who are not prone to such economic success (and possibly not much success at anything but it’s been too long ago to recall it all).

        I have two good friends that are self made millionaires.  One is an auto mechanic who bought a cheap building he used as a garage to fix cars.  In his spare time he bought dirt cheap cars and fixed them and sold them.  Simple as that, no genius not even a great mechanic.  The other guy bought a used dump truck then a used trash truck and now owns a dozen trash trucks and contracts with the city to pick up trash in a small nieghborhood.  A multimillionaire who can’t even spell the word.  I have know a few geniuses who live comfortably, own their home and a decent car and like their jobs.  I did ask one why he didn’t parlay his skills into millions and he said he didn’t want riches he wanted family, love and comfort.  That was really smart.  That may be the smartest thing a man can do with his life; family, love and comfort.

        I think the French had a derogatory term for it: Nouveau Riche.

        I think there is more to this than meets the eye.  TNR was the house organ for the old Democrat/neoliberal coalition now represented by Hillary Clinton.  Marty Peretz, the old owner, was a staunchly pro-Israeli Jew who often said and wrote impolitic things about Muslims, blacks, and Hispanics.The Millenial LeftObama Coalition, of which Chris Hughes and his husband are exemplars, is a very different group of progressives.   They hate whites, they hate straights, they hate the U.S., and they especially hate Israel.  They went after Peretz with a fury, until he had finally had enough and sold out, and now they are going after the rest of his legacy, and the legacy of his version of the Left.The Jews at TNR have been pushed out:http://freebeacon.com/national-security/hughes-drops-jews/Expect a strongly anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian viewpoint to prevail at the new New Republic.Literary editor Leon Wieseltier, one of the two major figures whose resignation sparked the exodus, was very close to Peretz, supported the Iraq war, and wrote a letter of support for Scooter Libbey.  One can see why he and Hughes clashed.The old Democrat coalition is dead, and everyone knows it except Hillary Clinton.  Its replacement, the Obama coalition, is collapsing around the tarnished figure of their Dear Leader.  The progressive millenials are desperate to staunch the bleeding, and probably figured they could utilize what’s left of THR’s storied reputation to assist in the endeavor.  Hughes, who along with his husband is desparate to make a differencehttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/06/fashion/chris-hughes-and-sean-eldridge-are-the-new-power-brokers.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0is the savior with a bank account.This is the sort of thing the Millenial Left has in mind for Israel:http://freebeacon.com/national-security/reports-obama-mulling-sanctions-on-israel/

            That’s a good point about Hughes and the new-new-left. People assume all Jews support Israel, but that’s never been the case. The Zionists have always been a minority within the American Jewish community. Israel gets most of its support in the US from Evangelicals.
The sight queer Nazis savaging the liberal establishment is tearing me up inside.
