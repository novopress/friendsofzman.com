        Nah – there’s a difference between the factory farms and the alternatives. Although cage free eggs are a scam. The chickens are allocated fewer square feet when they are cage free vs. when they are caged. And yet the cage free eggs cost more.

        The food part of Whole Foods is bullshit (no Total cereal!?!) but they do right by labor (insurance, 401k, paid leave), the environment and animals (humane treatment) so they’re not too scorn worthy in my book.
