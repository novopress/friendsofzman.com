        When did the American ideology become spreading homosexuality and feminism around the globe? I know that this is in part with liberalism, but at some point you had politicians and officials saying explicitly that America was in these countries to turn the women into feminists and the men into homosexuals. At some point we went from Proposition 8 to the State Department flying “pride” flags outside embassies, thus, for all practical purposes, making THAT and not the stars and stripes our official national symbol.

When we “won” WWII. USA now stands for ‘Usury, Sodomy and Abortion’. One of the many joys of living under ZOG.

                No, that is when the seeds were planted, but this idea that we need to occupy Afghanistan forever so girls can go to school, or that the State Department’s primary mission is to support homosexual parades – this is very new.

                    As you say, I think the seeds were planted long ago, and these ideas get doubled down on as time goes on.  Seems to be a human tendency to take things to their logical conclusions.  Tech, particularly social media, has sped up this doubling down immensely in the past 15 years.

                    The confluence of post-modernism and radical equalitarianism required a constant search for new causes and ways to destroy the old order. The lunacy of radical feminism and perversion/transgenderism kind of made them the last frontiers and an endpoint. To answer your question, I think these causes, such as they are, probably came into their own with the advent of gay “marriage” in 2015. I also think the embrace of these insane notions has led to a post-ideological moment and things are going in the direction of a naked who/whom (see my earlier comment).

                        It might just be as simple as a naked who/whom. Prop 8 seemed to usher in a type of liberal vengeance where they decided to use the power of the state to impose their values on the proles. Of course that took time to work through the system but when it was done, it was all there and that train has no stops. Telling the proles’ sons that they were actually girls seems more like punishment than anything, in this context. Likewise with immigration, people voted for immigration restriction and the system responded by flooding their towns with Haitians (in the USA) or Pakistanis (in the UK).

                            Politics may be entirely narcissistic. Say, there’s a kind of person to whom other people’s lives and minds are an affront. That’s the kind of person who rules, seeks rule, accepts orenjoysrule, etc.Or— For whatever reason, there’s someone you want to hurt, vengefully or sadistically or resentfully or [any Nietzschean adverb]. You invent a future in which your violence was just. That invention is “ideology”—or “values” or “principles” or whichever is the shibboleth of your people.The bloodthirstier Marxists are right about one big thing, I think: The premise thatideas motivatedoesn’t fit the world. “Ideology” is soothing language. Not that the term is soothing (it is), but: Ideologyisgoo-goo-ga-ga-who’s-a-big-boy. Its being readily changeable, incoherent, thoughtlessly repeated, etc., makes itbetter. That’s why argument never “works” (except as self-soothing).“They don’t want this done to them” is the argument that works least.

                Yeah it really ramped up with WW2 because so many women took war jobs, in the absence of men.  That got them away from the family hearth and into the expectation of careerism and independence . . . and soon, under preferential conditions.
As for the explicit exportation of feminism and homosexuality to the world, I’d say it became Primary Policy mebbe 30 years ago.

                    The emancipation of women might have been one of our greatest mistakes.  We have a mural of a race-swapped Rosie the Riveter in a town near us, when we know the obvious reality.The gals fell right into the jewish feminist movement and now we have Girl Bosses in positions of power.

                        Indeed it was.  Not just politically, but also in terms of plain domestic tranquility.  When wives ask “says who” the old answers – husband or father – no longer apply.  Now it’s either ‘nobody’ or The State.  Hierarchy was destroyed, and with it all female respect for male authority.  Thus, in turn, the ability for wives to love their neutered husbands was destroyed.  Once “domestic abuse” became a big issue the last terrible resort was banished, and it was over.

                            Exactly.The first practical target of the Sixties Feminists — many of whom were Jewish women btw — was ‘domestic abuse’ which meant anything a husband did to try to constrain his wife.They conquered that hurdle largely via the collusion of the U.S. government and its advertising (propaganda) organs.  Soon most jurisdictions simply arrested the male in any domestic complaint or dispute (the Duluth Model).Effectively, the cops and courts became ready weapons of female power.That led directly to the destruction of the American family, as dad no longer had any social or legal power.  This happened to be Priority #1 for the Sixties feminists.Now, as you say, either the State or nobody constrains female power-seeking and malevolence.  The State is the new husband of the American Woman, and it does whatever she goddam says.

                Z:“the United States continues to think and talk in explicitly moral terms about abstract concepts”.I hate to disagree with Z on this point, but what Elon &amp; DOGE are discovering is that Amurrikkkun Leftism was nothing but a very sophisticated money laundering operation designed to suck trillions of fiat shekels out of the United States’ Federal Reserve, and into the grubby little paws of (((Geneva &amp; Zurich &amp; Tel-Aviv))).The leftist-faux-moralism was simply for show.None of it was organic nor sincere.Leftist-faux-moralismwas simply the fig leaf necessary to keep the goyim from noticing that their Treasury had been systematically looted ever since 1913.As an example, (((Chelsea Clinton &amp; Marc Mezvinsky))) succeeded in laundering something like70 MILLION DOLLARSout of the Treasury.

Obviously all the DEM politicians are simply thieves.
My suspicion is that all the GOP politicians made the mandatory trip to “The Alibi Club”, and that the Mossad has high quality video &amp; audio of the GOP politicians at play with the Cabana Boys…
[Possibly excepting the two gentlemen from Kentucky; Paul &amp; Massie.]

                I hate to keep beating a dead horse, but none of this nonsense matters whatsoever.Not a whit.For at least the next half-century [if not the next half a millennium], there will be one and only one pertinent issue in the entire world: Were you &amp; your fambly v@xxinated, or did you &amp; your fambly remain Pureb00ded?A Horrifying Breakthrough in the WHITE FIBROUS CLOT Sagahttps://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/4307726/postshttps://laurakasner.substack.com/p/a-horrifying-breakthrough-in-theEvery single article I read now is Worst Case Scenario.Every two weeks or thereabouts; Worst Case Scenario.Imagine if the Medical Industrial Complex were ackshually interested in getting to the bottom of this Evil?As far as I can tell, everyone, GOP &amp; DEM &amp; IND, is onboard the Depopulationist Express.Even RFKjr has so far refused to address the V@xxpocalypse.Muh suspicion is that everyone is on the same page now; even Trump &amp; RFKjr have been ordered by their superiors to keep their d@mned moufs shut regarding the V@xxpocalypse.The Depopulationists are simply gonna shove the accelerator to the floor, and drive humanity straight off the cliff.Any future president, who bucks the Depopulationists, and attempts to address the V@xxpocalypse, will simply be JFK’ed.There isn’t a doubt in muh mind but that Trump &amp; RFKjr have already agreed to honor the marching orders, as issued by the Depopulationists.

            If you ask me, it’s the logical endpoint of liberalism, which I understand to be the idea that everybody has a valid perspective, at least in some sense. Everybody has a piece of the puzzle, so you have to be inclusive to grasp the problem in total. Again, follow that logic, without limits, and eventually you’ll be asking Satan for advice lol.

            For whites, the impetus towards liberalism was the belief that a person should never be judged, or suffer consequences, for a trait that one did not choose.
This seems like a humane aspiration until you realize that many immutable traits should limit your options. I hope that even liberals would still agree that blind people shouldn’t be pilots. (Is that hate now?)
Other races do not seem to share this impulse, but are happy to exploit it when arguing with whites. No other race has ever thought that homos should be tolerated or women be soldiers.

-he justified invading Iraq with the image of iraqi broads holding up there dumb purple fingers after voting-he boasted about his regime gave the most money to africa (BOTSWANA!)-post 911, he declared islam a “relgion of peace” but made it our respinsiblity to bring in more muslims than ever

                    I still remember the first time I saw a “Happy Ramadan” sign – it wasafter9/11. I don’t even think I knew what Ramadan was when I saw it. Now it is a minor American holiday. I think people today would find it hard to believe, but before 2001, there were for all intents and purposes no Muslims in the USA, and the few who were here were basically culturally assimilated individuals in big cities. It’s almost hard to believe that we fight this GWOT and decades of mass bombing against Muslims and now we also have Muslim cities and mosques everywhere.I can’t think of an equivalent. Yea we fought Japan for four years and by the 1970s the Japanese were significant players in the American economy and culture but that was a period of decades. This happened simultaneously.

                        To this day one of the most incomprehensible things about 9/11 (other than WTC #7, LOL) is thatwe startedletting millions of Muslims in after the attack!“Hey, a bunch of Muslims hijacked some airplanes and crashed them into the WTC and the Pentagon, what’ll we do guys?”“Let’s let millions of them emigrate to the U.S.!”I stay out of the city as much as possible, but the last time I drove through what was the historically the “negro ghetto” it looked like fucking Karachi — dudes in man-robes and sandals wearing kufis everywhere, women dressed in black with full facial covering.WTF? Where did all these people come from? The country I grew up in was 90% white, 10% black — and the blacks wereverysegregated, even in the North. I knew almost nothing about Islam prior to 2001 and had never met or seen a Muslim in my life.Today there are fucking mosques and swarthy peopleeverywhere.

                            Back in 2003 or 2004 I drove through New Brunswick, New Jersey and was shocked and appalled by all mysterious brown meat in the streets. Verily, I felt as though I had been apprehended by some malevolent force and deposited in Libya or Azerbaijan or Turkmenistan. Whether all of those aliens flooded into New Brunswick in the aftermath of 9/11, I do not know. All I know is that they were there, and I’m sure there are even more of them there now. **smh**

                                About 15 years ago I lived in a college town in Oregon.  Rented an apartment in a complex with many arab young men.They took to standing around, one by one, on all the street corners in the neighborhood, yammering constantly into phones and scouting around.Of course, we didn’t get along.  One day when they were hanging out in a group in the parking lot outside my apartment, I took the 12 gauge on a slow walk to my hatchback, right past their group.  Put it in the car, took it out of the car, smiled as I walked back to my apt. past them.I don’t allow anybody to take over my neighborhood, even if it’s 6 month apartment rental.  They didn’t like it and scowled at me a lot, but they also stopped playing gangsta on my streetcorners.By that time tho, I’d already decided to leave the U.S.

                        Ramadan is more accurately called, “Ram-a-scam.”
This is because their idea of, “fasting,” is engorging themselves at all-night parties and sleeping all day.
Ramadan food waste and weight gain are both very real.
I know because I used to read the articles in the French language newspapers of the MENA country I lived and worked in for 5 years.

                    After 9/11, my two causes were enforcing immigration law and fighting muslims. W lost me when he said that we had to fight them over there to prevent them from coming here.
This was his tacit admission that his admin wanted open borders.
After then came the 2 amnesty attempts. Whenever I get too despairing about our ability to effect change, I remember that we stopped those amnesties.

        I’d like to shine some light on another aspect of the Catholic Charities situation from my professional experience.  A big focus of this charity is bringing in foreigners, yes, but the other aspect that people probably don’t realize is that the funds the charity raise are in large part transferred to Real Estate companies/investors to house said foreigners.  I’m sure you can surmise who owns a bulk of the real estate benefiting from these payments.  Really calls in to question who this charity ultimately aims to benefit.  Of course they’ll say it’s about helping the poor, downtrodden foreigners but in reality it’s just another transfer of wealth to the landed gentry.

        I don’t see the American Ideology of egalite, female supremacism, and homosexuality dying.  I see some folks trying to kill it, of which I am one.  But it isn’t ‘dying on its own’ that’s for damn sure.The first few months of Orangie Dos have given hope that America’s satanic religion uh I mean ideology somehow is expiring.  I see little evidence of that, given that the Regime still controls all the institutions and the deep-state, or bureaucracy.  USAID?  Drop in the bucket.When one studies the history of the Jews in Scripture, one finds them in constant regression to the paleolithic mother/goddess imago, and to matriarchal control.  God would punish them and even send them into bondage, but they never could shake their jones.The greatest kings of the Hebrew ancient world were David and his boyo, Solomon.  God even said he loved David, basically.  You don’t hear that a lot from Him.Yet both kings fell to the power of women: David was compromised by Bathsheba and eventually became party to murder because of her.  Solomon took so many pagan wives that eventually they overthrew his mind, and his will.  (Building demonic altars kinda gives you away.)America, partly due to Jewish influence, is the most feminist nation that ever existed, and make no mistake, the collective power of females is at the core of this supposed ‘ideology’.  Female power is what Ms. America really is shoving down the world’s throat, and female power is what’s destroying the U.S. from within.U.S. men are as defenseless against this as their Hebrew counterparts in the old world.  In fact, American men — fat with material ease — have set a new standard for cucky cowardice, as they either collude with, or are silent under the Pradas of Big Sister.

            This.  Every university and public school and corporation and organization that claims it no longer has DEI or ESG as official goals still has the basic tenets deeply embedded and practiced daily.  It’s why White men are at the bottom of the heap in being accepted to college or getting hired for most jobs.  All of the ‘middle class’ still remains convinced that anyone can be an “American”and that only color-blind ‘merit’ should matter – deliberately remaining blindly ignorant of sexual differences and ethnic origins and loyalties.  The equalitarian lie has a deep hold in AINO, based on various resentments and self-told lies about why anyone gets ahead and another doesn’t.  I don’t see anything breaking through the ‘murican fantasy except civil conflict and lots of death.

                ‘I don’t see anything breaking through the ‘murican fantasy except civil conflict and lots of death’Sadly, I agree 3g4me.I believe America to be the nation named in Daniel 12:1 involving a ‘time of trouble’ unlike any in all of humanity’s past . . . and there have been some doozies.Christian pastors translate that ‘trouble’ as a general Tribulation of disasters and horrors. Which, to an extent, is true.But only half-true. Because the primary Hebrew translation of ‘trouble’ is ‘female adversary’ or ‘rival wife’, referring to the spiritual entity behind the feminist movement, and to that movement’s broad gestalt and dominion in the West.Because America is the stronghold and global enforcer of Feminism, it follows that America is home turf of this demonic spirit that seeks to destroy masculinity and fatherhood.America is a nation that hates its own Father and does everything in its power to break the bonds between dad and son. . . and between husband and wife.For these reasons and those of personal witness, I believe God will punish and make a horrific example out of America, as prophesied in the cited passage from Daniel.

            Good history, Ray, but…
“When one studies the history of the Jews in Scripture, one finds them in constant regression to the paleolithic mother/goddess imago, and to matriarchal control.”
How do you square that with the proscription against women being religious leaders and even today only the men get paid to study torah/talmud?

                Most of the political, military and economic leaders of America are men . . . yet women run the show, everybody knows it, nobody will say it. You can have male figureheads in power and still have a gynocentric and gynocratic nation. The U.S. as proof.Men are in leadership positions but overwhelmingly hew to female socio-legal imperatives.As for Jews, amongst the Orthodox you will find a number of male-primary holdovers from ancient Judaism, including male Torah study. Again, Israel has male leadership, yet from a legal and social standpoint — especially in Tel Aviv — it’s a liberal, feminist nation.Reformed and atheistic Jews inevitably move their host populations ever leftwards, away from God and towards worship of ideology or females. Idolatry was the pattern of Hebrews historically, also.The Reformed permit, and for all I know encourage, female ‘rabbis’. Of course the whole ‘Reformed’ bit is wearing the skinsuit of conquered, patriarchal Judaism while marching in the pussy hat and homo pride parades.

                    Waay back when, my major professor would often entertain challenges and questions in the classroom.  I’ve begun of late to appreciate his wry insight and response to some of the “gotcha” questions posed by students.
One question posed by a budding “feminist” co-ed was regarding his opinion of the “women’s rights movement”.  His response was quick and pointed.  Something to the effect, “…if you want to fight for “second place” in society, go right ahead…”.   😉

        The U.S. has been an ideological empire since 1917, when Wilson abandoned the Monroe Doctrine and declared that the U.S. must get involved in a European war against a country that never attacked us to make the entire WORLD “safe for democracy.”FDR’s “Four Freedoms,” announcing the rights to freedom from ‘fear” and “want”  “everywhere in the world” were a corollary to the imperial ideology.After the American cultural revolution of the Sixties, that transformed into anal sex, abortion and transgenderism — plus Zionism — “everywhere in the world.”Difficult not to agree with the people who think that the U.S. is the “Great Satan”…

            “The U.S. has beenan ideological empire since 1917…”That’s true as far back as you’ve dared to think, but remember Publius’Federalist No. 1, esp. thefirstparagraph. AH very consciously promoted the reorganization of the “empire” (quoting AH) to which some class rebels had given birth only eleven years before by partitioning an empire.The subject speaks its own importance; comprehending in its consequences nothing less than the existence of the union, the safety and welfare of the parts of which it is composed, the fate of an empire in many respectsthe most interesting in the world.Now why would AH—an orphan born out of wedlock and taken in by a prosperous merchant—have called the “UNION” the most interesting in the world? Because it was at its founding a sharp, ideological turn away from the old regime of crown and altar in which people with tawdry or murky backgrounds found it difficult to rise into powerful positions like the seats in the House of Lords (Yes, I mean to imply that merchants have a tawdriness which disqualifies them from a right to rule.)

            Yes, at bare minimum, a proto-ideology has underpinned America for a very long time. Certainly, the US has always been a messianic country, and messianic fervor is the driest tinder for an ideological conflagration. However, while we all wish America would have tended its own knitting rather than crusading for democracy across the globe, at least that earlier proto-ideology was not particularly noisome. Thinking democracy and so-called “human rights” were for everybody was foolish, but not abominable. What we’ve seen since the conclusion of the Cold War is an ideology of Satanic stripe. We may have shaken our heads ruefully at America’s geopolitical tomfoolery ca. 1925; we observe the machinations of 2025 and know that heads must roll from Washington to Wall Street to Harvard.

        When I was a conservative, I bristled at China’s accusation that we were always at war from the beginning.But it was true.  We have always been at war, whether on behalf of corporations or ideologies.What Z is telling me is that America has been judaized from the time jews entered the elite, and that our society has been warped by their ideas of social justice.  Our wars were noble and just, as told by the greatest liars in all of history.Tikkun olam is good for the jews, especially when they rob us to pay for their generosity to all the losers and freaks of the world.  Far too many Americans have died in their wars to “free the oppressed”.We cannot have a nation of free Whites that includes jews.  They are a cancer to any Occidental society.

        The ideology of the United States, radical equalitarianism, is a nutty religion that has become too transparently insane to be sustained. It seems to be holding firmer in the West European and other satrapies, but at some point it will begin to die in those places as well. There likely will be a counter-revolutionary Julian the Apostate arise at some point to try to restore DEI, transgenderism and the other lunacies, but reality probably will win out.Trump arguably is post-ideological, but he also clings to the radical equalitarianism delusion at least in part. What follows him, though, will be an initially subtle who/whom. By throwing open the borders and imposing the civil rights regime, the old religion has made certain what comes next will be disruptive and likely violent at times and around the edges (we see this now). The fragmentation and self-sorting currently underway will make clear the “who” and “whom.” What you describe as “non-ideological” promises to be tribal, which is the historical and natural default position.

            Trump is an Enlightenment equalitarian, but the tribe of Usury Sodomy Abortion he works for is not.Please remember how this works, as it worked in the ancient past, and in the more recent past once liberated by White technology (deepwater sailing ships, Gutenberg, the British Industrial Revolution and petroleum…)The landed gentry (Aryans long ago, “Puritans” and “Masons” then, Postmodern communalists now) are the majority advancing, but they follow the beliefs of a parasitic minority…that minority leads the way of the advance. (Neocons, tech oligarchs.)Parasites are the software “drivers”. The ant is bigger, but the virus drives it.——————————In our case, women, being the soft underbelly, the chink in the armor, is where the virus, the Hell layer’s Infection, festered;in other cases, it was in the men (Muslims, Calvinists),or women (Roman mystery cults),or homosexuals (twisted wiring),or nonwhites (the breeder hindbrain),or half-breeds (Akkadians, Hebrews/Habiru cultivating lineages that could survive the touch of the broken but still semi-functional Arc of the Covenant technology.)Any virus or bacterium will try to find an “in” in which to fester. In flesh, or in spirit.

I told myself I wasn’t to comment; the focus needs to be on getting the science up to speed, up to translation, a base others can build on, because going in half-assed was an absolute fucking disaster.
It was like throwing a pebble not into a pond, but into a raging river; it could not possibly have made a difference. Still, some want to try again. I can’t face it, I can’t.

                Alzaebo – Did we both use the term ‘landed gentry’ today independently (in an excellent example of synchronicity) or were you inspired by my comment earlier?
I sense we’re pretty similar so it wouldn’t surprise me (we really like expanding our thoughts in parentheses, probably an autist thing).

            Nothing wrong with grilling as long as it’s venison. Ate some venison souvlaki on a pita a couple of days ago, and cut up the leftover meat for venison and eggs this morning. Delicious.
The bastards are out of control around here, we have hit three of them in three separate vehicles in the past year and half. Wife totaled out a car hitting one two weeks ago.
Kill and grill as many of ’em as you can…

            People tend to think about the winners when it comes to evolution. There are far more losers in the game of life. Whites could very well be like the panda bear, in that we evolved down a dead end. Or, we are headed to a bottleneck, which has happened in the past. What emerges is free of the mutational load that lead to the bottleneck.

                Well, maybe we just got to the finish line first.  The White Man beat nature and all his rivals and maximized his comfort.  Game of life won.  Playing further is just running up the score.  And what prizes are left to win?
If the Others want to keep playing for first runner-up, then so be it.  They’re mucking up the world so badly, poisoning it with industrial and biological filth, that it’ll be unlivable in a couple centuries anyway.

                Probably the best way to exterminate any race of humans is to offer their women a way to attain a comfortable but not necessarily lavish lifestyle without needing a man. Just allowing them to compete equally with men won’t do because the men will still come out on top in any job requiring great strength of mind or body. Thus you favor the women in everything and guide them into “work” that is basically just time wasting busy-work – your friendly neighborhood HR dept, for example. This kills their desire for (most) men and thus the birthrate. Sure, they’ll still slut it up with random dudes but that’s what abortion is for.You probably don’t want to just hand them the money they need to live on. I think the 60s liberals were trying this with welfare for blacks. They were trying to do a sneaky genocide that they thought everyone would thank them for eventually. The idea was that black women would prefer a small welfare check to being forced to live with their own (often violent and criminal) men and this would kill the black birthrate. The problem was that they didn’t have enough to do and so it probably caused the birthrate to go up. They had forgotten the crucial element of time-wasting busy-work to keep the women occupied with anything other than children. The grrlboss feminism peddled to White grrls is far more effective.As for the anal sex, well all those beta males the women reject while chasing Chad need some kind of outlet. The dogma that most gays are “born that way” is not well supported by evidence and there’s lots of evidence both historical and contemporary of “homosexuality of convenience” in places like prisons, same-sex schools, and sailing ships. Setting a massive media propaganda machine at the task of glorifying and hyping this lifestyle certainly can’t hurt.

        “American” ideology starts with Woodrow Wilson, plain and simple. He was the prophet of American internationalism, the “spread of democracy”, and America’s role as “world police”. Sure, Ted Roosevelt brought forth the Great White Fleet, announcing that America was now a main player on the world stage, but that was not ideology – that was just dick-slinging.Lincoln’s “ideology” was more in the nature of Stalin’s “socialism in one country”, than a project for re-shaping the world at large. Was he an autocrat? Yes. Was he evil? Probably. Did he have some grand design for demo-forming the world, as Wilson did? No.Wilson, though… what a lunatic. We all laugh at the accumulation of Very Clever Boys around FDR, but it was Wilson who started it all. If you doubt it, consult Walter Lippmann’s 1920 bookPublic Opinion, which argues that the public has no competence to judge what is done at the level of policy, therefore should be blocked from its’ formation.

        I certainly hope the American ideology is dying out – it’s represented an awful lot of death and destruction around the world.  Further it sounds like there are lots of good reasons to send our greatest ally’s countrymen here all packing back to our greatest ally – sans whatever wealth they’ve accumulated.

        “Rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated.”
— Ideology, probably.
Ideology cannot die. In a complex world, there is no empirical method of epistemology. And even if there were, the challenge would be why we think empiricism is the key to correct epistemology.
Sure, rationalism has no better groundwork. Faith is all that supports the idea that reason is the path to truth. But reason as Europeans understand the idea is mostly rooted Christian origins, so was never at odds with faith.

            Russell Kirk said that the conservative temperament is the negation of ideology. It is a preference that social change always be slow and considered.
Perhaps against Kirk’s wishes, conservatism became an ideology.
As your review of our epistemic limits shows, there is probably no way to demonstrate that you have no ideology. Your opponent will always see you as advancing an ideology.

        About a week or so ago, big soda was paying “maga” influencers to shill for them. Kennedy wants to ban SNAP users from buying soda with the food stamps and the “maga” influencers were crying about it saying they should be able to buy soda with it.Aaron Macintyre did a video about the shilling complaining that conservatives oppose SNAP.  When exactly did it become a conservative principle to let your fellow countrymen starve in America?  Yes, I know SNAP is not without its problems, but for crying out loud this really shows the emptiness of conservative ideology.  These same people will cheer and chant USA at the first sign of military expansionism.  These are not budget hawks.  Something like 50 million Americans used food bank services in 2022, the most recent that came up in google.  I heard it was higher than that.  If you are concerned about money, SNAP is the least of your worries.

                    I think limitations on what you can buy is reasonable and would support it.  SNAP is funded in the farm bill giving billions of Dollars to big ag.  The solution to not funding JaQuarious or Shaniqua is not to say “well, nobody gets nuffin!!”Look, you cannot be all for big bidness outsourcing jobs to anywhere without environmental and worker safety regulations and appalling living conditions (low wages) and then get mad when 10s of millions of the former middle class and their kids needs help.  This is just one of the costs everyone just ignores of globalism and free trade.  The people not being out-competed by foreigners in foreign lands are getting out-competed here too with foreigners living 10 to a hovel working for wages we cannot afford to work for.

It’s awful.  But given it isn’t going to change any time soon, we have to work with what we got.  There are so many things that should be WAY higher priority.   Even illegals getting state benefits is not nearly as bad as the army of bureaucrats we employ. Not only do we pay their salaries and all associated costs, the very work they do imposes even larger costs.

                    I think Food Stamps/SNAP or whatever they call it now IS limited to certain “necessary” foodstuffs.
But it’s my understanding that fraud is rampant in the system, i.e. Arab grocers in back neighborhoods accept benefits for Colt 45, Newports, and rolling papers at a rate of fifty cents on the dollar and pocket the difference.

                    While I have heard of people buying stuff not covered by food stamps and selling food stamps for 50 cents on the Dollar, I’ve never heard of soda being an informal currency.  Where I live, there is also a big tax on “soda,” (basically anything you can drink is included, including diet soda, teas, the flavored milk like stuff, orange juice, grapefruit juice and I believe even bottled water) 2 cents an ounce which is 128 on the 2 liter bottles.  I’ve heard they are cracking down on the snap corruption in my area, but I’m not a recipient or a merchant, so I really don’t know for sure.  That’s the problem with all these Asian store owners.  Asia is the king of corruption, whether it’s Pakistan, India, China, Bangladesh, Thailand, etc. I think the only exception is Japan.  They are all loaded with corruption.  Like Mexicans, they bring their corruption with them.

                To be more accurate, without really undermining your point, pop doesn’t cause anything; it’s the irresponsible consumption of it–particularly by the wogs–that harms society.

        There is actually a simple explanation for how we have gotten to where we are. The American system is a combination of state atheism (disguised as tolerance/no preference) and a capitalist system based on usury. This system was originally run by the liberal Protestant elite. They were broadly tolerant of Christianity as long as it did not interfere with their economic interests. In the twentieth century, that system was taken over by Jews. They control the institutions the Z Man noted (media, entertainment, publishing) and thus the culture of the country. The control of culture and the ideology of state atheism gave them a powerful ideological platform to attack Christianity. Any public policy based on Christian beliefs is deemed automatically forbidden. The usurious system was right up their alley, they being the traditional usurers in Europe. It allowed them to amass enormous wealth and drain the rest of society of wealth, further increasing their clout. The liberal Protestants were helpless to oppose this takeover, since they created the system and any attempt to prevent Jews from taking it over would have been bigoted and illiberal in their eyes. The conservative Protestants have been seduced by Millennialism and have become worshipers of Israel and war and so they too are helpless to oppose the Judaized system.

            Excellent. I appreciate your focus on usury, which is not often discussed on Z Man’s site.
I defended usury when I was a conservative because the lender was taking a risk in lending the money and had a right to be compensated.
True, but just like we put limits on how much a business can pollute, we can put limits on the amount one is able to earn on lending. It’s not a law of nature that lenders must rule us.
Z Man and RamzPaul: Discuss usury and the attempts to constrain it.  Also Marbury vs. Madison.

                Many, many years ago there was legislation passed to correct the problem of credit card usury.  All it did was protect the lender from most bankruptcies.  One aspect they discussed, and I even thought passed, was that unsecured loans would have a max of two years payback.  In other words, your payment + interest is computed to get you out of the specific debt in two years.  No longer do you get to borrow and pay back a “loan” for an indefinite period, which usually means a death spiral wrt finally being free of loan obligations—and of course it would limit your total monthly debt obligation to something that could be repaid.Since I have not carried a charge on any account for decades, I was unaware of the current situation until I once made a single $2k charge on a card and got the monthly payment request—$28(?).  One can see that the interest + payback on this “loan” would extend out for years and years.  At 11% (and the rate could vary even), that’s usury!

                Limits on “usury” are indistinguishable from “redlining” regulation, and end in the same place.

        Read pages 494-544 of “Leviathan and Its Enemies” by Samuel T. Francis.  That concluding chapter explains why the socio/political/economic complex has developed exactly the same way in all modern cumulative economies.  The people in command of the commercial, communications, and authoritative apparatuses in those countries believe in playing to win the Game of Life.   Strangely enough, their philosophy of “helping” others enriches themselves while immiserating those they help.  Thus it has always been.Interestingly, Musa Al’ Gharbi’s book “We have Never been Woke: The Cultural Contradictions of a New Elite” admits as much-the Woke philosophy promises salvation for all but in practice monetizes their virtue while helping no one else.  Again, fancy that.  Al’ Gharbi does not identity Sam Francis in his references, but the description of Woke matches Leviathan in its source and application.And it is doubtful that a dissident regime would govern in a different manner.  As we are all mortal, the temptation to abuse positions of influence, power, or authority to enrich ourselves during our short time on Earth will remain, whatever the operating principle of the society.  Replacing one set of rulers with one view of how life ought to be lived with another group with a dissimilar viewpoint does not remove the material temptation.   Biden/Soros vs. Trump/Musk.  Any difference merely reflects who the regime hates-those citizens will be abused; the remainder will be infantilized into wage and debt chains from which they cannot break.

        Hyam Salomon did not finance the Revolutionary War. This is a myth promoted by Polish Jews, competing with established German Jews for status when they began to enter this country in numbers after the turn of the 19th century. He was a broker working for Robert Morris – the true Financier of the Revolution. His knowledge of languages made him useful to Morris, but there were many other men doing similar work at that time. For a scholarly discussion of Salomon, see Dr. Beth S. Wenger’s work “History Lessons: The Creation of American Jewish Heritage.” (Princeton University Press) Chapter five, subtitled “The Myths and Monuments of Hyam Salomon,” is devoted to debunking the false claims that have been allowed to circulate about his actual contribution to the Revolutionary War effort.

        I I’m really off topic. But points here about academics could be made if conservatives about race:The most dispiriting trait of the professional scholars is not their consensus about Shakespeare’s identify, but their refusal to admit that there can be any room for doubt. Realizing very well how little is known about Mr.Shakspere of Stratford, they should at least allow for an agnostic middle ground. It is one thing to say that the testimony in favor of Mr.Shakspere’s authorship remains, on balance, more satisfying than all the arguments made against it. It’s quite another matter to concede nothing to dissent, or even uncertainty. In the writings of orthodox scholars on the anti-Stratfordian heresies, it is rare to find a concessive note. Animadversions, often vituperative, are the rule. It is almost never admitted that any of the heretics has ever raised a point worth taking into account. The impulse to scold the dissenter; the inability to acknowledge even the possibility of reasonable doubt; suspicion even of the noncommittal; the denial of ambiguities in our imperfect records of the past; intense frustration with anything less than unanimity; the conviction that dissent reveals a moral or psychological defect these are the marks of the brittle belief systems we call cults or ideologies, as opposed to the balanced judgment that tries to come to terms with all the available evidence….…If I turn out to be a crank with aristocratic sympathies and a paranoid mentality, so be it.If it comes to that, what is so bad about cranks? The charge of crankery is apt to be thrown at people for no better reason than that they insist on making up their own minds at all costs, in spite of all social pressures and conventions. Personally, I would much rather be in the tradition of great American cranks like Thoreau, Ambrose Bierce, Lysander Spooner, and H.L. Mencken, or even obscure cranks like the aforementioned lady in Mississippi, than belong to the mass of scholars who, ever mindful of tenure, promotion, grants, and that last infirmity of ignoble minds, respectability, never deviate from scholarly consensus.

                Sobran was right, to a point. The 17th Earl of Oxford presented Thomas North’s works, both word for word and slightly altered, as Shakespeare. The queer Earl wrote the sonnets, not the plays. Unz recently compiled it all.

                    Which is why the sonnets, which describe an older man, homo- or bi-sexual, lame, and in disgrace never was consistent with the actual William Shakespeare. They were describing Oxford to a tee.
