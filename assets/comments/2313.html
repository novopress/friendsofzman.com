        I’ll admit to being partial to some central planning, provided the people doing the planning are competent . Maybe republicans make better planners than democrats.

        Central planning fails because it is all about allocation, not efficiency. A free market is always adjusting allocations, features, quality, and price charged on the good or service, in an attempt to zero in on the moving target of what combination of costs and features is the most desired, at that particular moment. Central planning decides on features, stacks up the inventory, and then distributes it out. It has no feedback loop to make things more appropriate for the marketplace at any given moment.

        The ONLY reason Socialism has NEVER worked is because it just hasn’t been done RIGHT yet. *sigh*SURELY, everyone will be happy THIS time, with the RIGHT people “leading the way”.
Which brings me back to the “Punch in the face” meme.
