        We sort of ran a giant experiment since 2017 to assess the power of the nominal president. Trump 1.0 was a president who actually wanted to govern, that is to set the overall course. The result was incredible friction, rancor and resistance from the permanent bureaucracy that actually governs. Kind of like engaging the gear in manual transmission without clutching out first. Every sprocket screamed.The second experiment was a vegetable “president”. The system ran almost without a hitch. Together these two experiments were very conclusive; the president is like the king of England. He has very little to do with government.This is so against the Disney version of government you learn in civics class that most people ignorere the clear and unambiguous evidence in front of them and go with the nursery stories they feel comfortable with. This is typical human behavior. We are an immensely herdable species, like sheep

            A comfortable lie trumps an uncomfortable truth every time. However, I’d add that how the government was designed to work—and perhaps used to work—and how the government now works has a basis in the concept of understanding.  Man’s innate need to understand.How the government is supposed to work can be explained to most people in a few paragraphs. Indeed, we were taught such in the 8th grade if I recall. It was a comforting fairy tale. How the government now works is unfathomable to just about everyone and lack of understanding is a horror all to itself.I don’t blame Europeans from assuming a demented soul like Biden is calling the shots, what is the alternative? That a cabal of unknown, uncontrollable, nameless, uncaring, unaccountable individuals have you and your family’s life in their hands?Oh the horror. The horror.

                We don’t know who actually calls the shots. Sullivan, blinken? Maybe but maybe they have handlers too. It’s increasingly reminiscent of the Mob or maybe spy games. And I think the spy agencies are central to what’s going on

                Though things were never as simple as an 8th grade civics class would teach you, it was much closer to the truth before FDR.  FDR fundamentally changed the way the government ran.  He massively increased the size and scope of government in the US, especially leading up to the war and the war years.  Unlike previous wars where the government would shrink at the end of hostilities, there was no real dismantling of the war state at the end of the war other than reducing the number of enlisted men.  We live with this to this day.

                    FDR was a piker compared to the foot in the door that was the Administrative Procedures Act. This is what gave us the federal agencies able to do their rule-making almost behind closed doors. Sure, they have to post in the now ~75,000 page per year Federal Register and allow for comments, but are under no obligation to read these comments, and until the internet, it was only accessible in Washington, DC and certain of the regional depositories.It also gave us the rubber stamp that is administrative court, which decides not whether you have violated some law, but rather whether the agency is obeying it’s procedure book, and the recently overturned Chevron Deference, .

                    I taught introductory American Politics for years, and when you teach the fundamentals of the Constitution to kids year after year, after a fashion you begin to realize that the actual government of the United States is so profoundly antithetical to what the Founders created in 1787 they would be shooting at it if they were alive today.The power structure of 1787, which created a federation of semi-sovereign states and a national government of limited and enumerated powers, was inverted 180 degrees by force of arms in 1865. Whereas the Bill of Rights begins with the phrase “Congress shall make no law,” the Fourteenth Amendment reads “No State shall…”That tells you everything you need to know about who is calling the shots.But it was really the Sixteenth Amendment of 1913 that enabled Leviathan. The income tax created a pot of money that had not previously existed and could now be used for an imperial military, to bribe states into compliance, and to buy votes with. Four years after the income tax we were involved in a European war, and 20 years after the amendment we got the New Deal.The things that Roosevelt got away with during the New Deal amounted to nothing less than a constitutional revolution. The original intent was completely ignored and the document was twisted beyond recognition by the sophisms of the Supreme Court. ReadWickard v. Filburnsometime… Madison would have shit himself if he could have seen that. Ditto forU.S. v. Miller, Roe v. Wade, and a host of other Supreme Court decisions from 1937-present.The New Deal created the permanent welfare/warfare state and the imperial presidency. 9/11 and digital technology created the Amerikan police state. We’re never going back to Jefferson’s America of 1804. I realized it was a fool’s errand to try to teach the Constitution to college kids when the United States Supreme Court didn’t even bother to adhere to it. After a fashion, trying to teach “the supreme law of the land” factually made me sound like a partisan nut and an unhinged old professor.I was flabbergasted when the Supreme Court finally overturnedRoe, I had spent 30 years arguing that, quite aside from the merits or demerits of abortion itself, it was legally unsound and completely untethered to actual text of the Constitution. But so is the entire federal government today…

                        “Wickard v. Filburn… “Isn’t that the wheat case from like 47?  That is one of the most insane court cases I have ever heard of, but granted, I’m not a lawyer and don’t spend time perusing SCOTUS decisions.I was watching an interview with a lawyer and he said he had a conversation with a federal cop and the lawyer asked the cop, could the feds enforce prostitution laws in a city.  The federal cop answered, of course.  Prostitution involves condoms which are made in one state and sold in another.  So there’s the interstate commerce justification number one.  Number two, johns travel to prostitutes on streets, which connect to interstate highways and so that’s justification number two.There is no human activity which the feds don’t already either regulate or claim the legitimate authority to regulate.  After all, if growing wheat on your own farm for your own use is interstate commerce, painting your house is also interstate commerce. Fixing an outlet in your house is also interstate commerce.  Your toilet connects to interstate water systems. It’s why you cannot get a decent shower head anymore.

                            Yep. 1942, actually. Upheld the New Deal’s Agricultural Adjustment Act under which the government set farm commodity prices and imposed penalties on those who exceeded crop quotas.A guy who grew an “excess” amount of wheat on his own private property and used it to feed his own livestock was fined. The wheat never left his property nor was sold across state lines. The Court ruled that his refusal to buy wheat on the open market had an “effect” on interstate commerce and the penalty was upheld.Wickardturned the “Interstate Commerce Clause” into a blank check for federal power. Anything that was tangentially deemed to “effect” interstate commerce fell under federal authority, even it it was not actually interstate nor commerce.

                        I guess Roe vs Wade had, as Z-man pointed out, a moral underlaying which the public could get behind—pro or con.  I’d say the solution/decision of the SCOTUS was in reality a compromise.  SCOTUS did not decide on the issue as in yes or no, just punted to the States knowing that most all would allow abort in one degree or another.  And so is was.

                            The Court simply applied the Constitution as written in theDobbscase. Regulation of abortion is a Tenth Amendment issue pertaining to the “police powers” of the several states to deal with as they see fit.Roeheld that the Constitution mandated that all states legalize it, which was simply absurd.

                                It’s incredible how many people don’t understand the categories in the 10th Amendment and how they were supposed to apply to the Constitution.
“Thepowers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution…”Article I, Section 8.
“…nor prohibited by it to the States…”Article I, Section 10.
Easy peasy. In language a first or second grader could follow.

                                True, That’s how the Court got out of the original decision.  But one must note that the original decision ignored the 10th and discovered a heretofore new “Constitutional Right”.  There was nothing requiring the Court to change its earlier opinion.  Hence it can be justifiably stated that the Court tossed the decision power back to the State.

                    When I think back to Wilson, ran on keeping us out of war. We go to war. Fed, income tax, and we are supposed to believe this narrative that his wife Edith ‘ran’ the place while the old man was a drooler.Right, is that story any more believable in hindsight than all the other fairy stories we were fed? I think not.The 19th Amendment, also during the ‘Wilson’ administration.So quite a hat trick of destruction for the United States. The first vegetable president to boot.FDR was bad, when combining Emperor Franklin and Woodrow Wilson, you can pretty much connect a lot of the dots to where we are today.

                        FDR was Wilson’s Navy military governor (de facto) in Haiti, there for the palm oil. He was lambasted as ‘the Butcher of Haiti’ at the time.  Made a name for himself and was judged suitable to the task.

            I remember reading Charles Krauthammer in late 2016 who said that Trump was a “stress test” for Washington. I remember thinking much the same thing; Trump was a needed test for the complacent classes in Washington.
Of course, Kraut saw Trump as a threat and by “stress test” he meant that this would test Washington to how well they could contain a “threat”.

                Once Biden “won” the election, we saw them breathe a sigh of collective relief, championing the return to “normalcy”. But it really wasn’t, these people spent four years getting high on their own supply, and came in with this sense of urgency to punish those who put them through that and implement as many zany schemes as possible to cement their control. Like they were making up for lost time. Hence the massive gibs packages, the green new deal masquerading as infrastructure, war against Russia, freaks like Levine and Brinton in the bureaucracy, total disenfranchisement of European descended people, State Department openly declsring their job is to spread homosexuality and feminism across the world, open borders, just pedal to the metal. In a way, it is a good thing, Washington has been fully unmasked.

        Once I saw that the CIA and Mossad rolled out ISIS yet again, just another way to throw sand in the works for Trump, I felt like I was actually the living embodiment of the “it’s all so tiresome” meme.

        This is why I keep coming back, Zman.  You obviously recognize all the lies and know how DC actually operates.  At least half the civnats and cuckservatards who urge people to write or call a congresscritter must know that the letters are logged (and trashed) and the phone is answered by some bright young aide from podunk U.  The laws are written by senior aides and advisors, and most of the time the congresscritter has no clue what’s in  the text.  He’s busy making deals and doing lunch and profiting off insider trading and wealthy lobbyists.The government is run by an army of utterly unaccountable people.  And even the sassy black secretaries aren’t totally to blame for much of the chaos – even before they all pretended towork from home, they were busy gossiping and doing their nails and they dumped any photocopying or filing on grad student interns (ask me how I know).Blame it on LBJ, blame it on FDR, blame it on Wilson, blame it on Lincoln.  They are all responsible and there is ample blame to go around.   And instead of wasting time by reading the noble rhetoric of the Federalist Papers, people ought to be taught the Anti-Federalist Papers.  Every warning and fear and caveat brought up against the original federal system back in the 18th century has come to pass in spades.There is no reforming Leviathan or ‘draining the swamp.’  There are occasional piecemeal attempts to nibble at the edges, but the army of federal employees throttles and ignores anything substantive.Burn it all down and salt the cursed ground occupied by the facade of those marble monuments to idiocracy that passes for “our democracy.”

            Had the opportunity to spend 2 days in DC for the first time since 1991.  Hiked the monuments. The ominous presence of the Capital Police is ever present.  The vibe is Police State and corrupting evil.  No need to ever return under the present regime.  Ozymandias writ large.

        Bill on Capitol Hill was some of the best agitprop ever produced, in large part due to its timing. Just as the managerial/intelligence takeover of fedguv was finally succeeding, or you could say had just succeeded, late 1970s, this cartoon appeared on tv to teach a whole generation a completely false and contrary reality, a fantasy, about “their” government, as if the previous half century had never happened. It was most certainly deliberate, since nobody at the network could have possibly been that naive about the way things worked.It ran every Saturday morning for years and years, indoctrinating millions whose naivety was real, because they were 8 years old. Then, as they reached their late teens/early 20s, they were hit with Jack Ryan, the selfless patriotic CIA analyst, but that’s another subject I’ve been over before.

            I completely disagree.  This had been accomplished 30 years before the late 70s.  Almost all of it happened under FDR.  But I do agree with you that it was a masterstroke of propaganda.  All those jingles are still in my head 40 plus years later.

                AFAIK, there is a subtle distinction between agitprop and propaganda.  While propaganda largely came from the Soviet state and Pravda, Agitprop was a different type propaganda spread by word of mouth from citizen to citizen.  It might have originated in the state, but that was not the primary way it was supposed to spread.  A kind of peer-to-peer propaganda.

                    The first two syllables of agitprop stand for agitation. Therefore, agitprop is propaganda intended to agitate the intended targets to action against the desired foe. Most history as it’s taught in AINO seeks to agitate non-whites to the destruction of all things white including the people themselves. The history, therefore, is agitprop.

            The bicentennial season of Schoolhouse Rock was the one with all the patriotic songs in it. A relative of mine worked on it. It was a hire-your-loser-friends project, since it was effectively anonymous. So I had one-sided records of a few of the songs, maybe test pressings for the albums that were never released. (My mother sold all my stuff while I was at college, and those have never turned up for resale.)I remember being told that one episode of the show was controversial with the FCC, but I don’t know which. They interpreted some will-of-the-people stuff as anti-bureaucracy, and they made some demands. The show wasn’t exactly the kind of propaganda it might seem to be in retrospect.I realized years later that all my childhood impressions of America™ came from bicentennialstufflingering around for the few years after the event. The politics of ’80s kids might have begun in the clearance racks (literal and cultural), with something as benign as big red white and blue novelty hats. Lately I’ve seen a few Democrats raging that Trump will be “in charge” (of what?) when the 250th happens, robbing them of a great generational propaganda opportunity. I guess Trump will put the traditionalgayrainbow on the giant hat, instead of the post-2020 everyone-but-breeding-white-people rainbow. The message will be white death anyway. “America is fortheseIndians now.”

Then with LBJ’s Great Society and Vietnam War it metastasized into today’s Leviathan.

            Yup.  Presto Change-o baby, welcome to the Great (Welfare) Society, CRA ’64 and the ’65 Immigration Act.  Phoenix rising from the alchemical retort.  The ‘solve’ phase of the American Crucible, the great dissolution into warring tribes, races and sexes.  Eminently manageable.Also, it was LBJ (Entered Apprentice, October 30, 1937, Johnson City Lodge #561, Johnson City, Texas) who captured the Executive for the mason/jacobin elements.  That office has been either collusive or compromised since, and intel has called the shots for the nation.1950s America truly was another country, bearing little resemblance to the ant farm being stage-managed now via manufactured consent.

                I’d argue Medicare/Medicaid of ’65 and the rest of the Great Society had an even bigger effect. That’s what institutionalized a permanent dependent class of useless eaters, and inventivized immigration. How many border jumpers would we have if they all had to make it on their own? How many ghetto rats would we be tossing in prison if they had all starved because their deadbeat dads wouldn’t get a job?
Certainly Medicare/Medicaid is a major cause of the US being in the financial situation it is.

                        I have less problem with Medicare than with absent-father welfare, which annihilated the inner cities and the black family a decade before feminism began in earnest to nuke the, well, nuclear family.  (Meaning, dad gets to have his house ‘n family.)
Long before Sixties feminism and identity politics doubled the workforce and slashed wages, influential persons and groups regarded the Global Village as the goal to be attained.
The extended family, then the nuclear family, were broken.  So elder care fell to those what broke it: the Federal Government and allied entities.  Medicare is the corporate and bureaucratic answer.

                        Oh, I know. It’s going to be an absolute train wreck. I don’t know that there is any way out of it other than kicking government out of medicine entirely. Not just Medicare and Medicaid, but also VA, Tricare, Obamacrap, HMO and insurance laws, FDA, etc. Everything. Maybe even banning health insurance as it exists now entirely. There is no way that can possibly be made fiscally sound, because the customer is not the payer.

                            Good gods, yes to all of that, it’s breaking us.
I still think of the medical malls I heard about in Thailand. Not sure if it’s true, but apparently you can walk in and get everything from dental work to an MRI for really, really, cheap, since it works on a cash basis.
Med care should be like car repair; it used to be that the repairman would come to a sick person’s house with his black bag, rather than forcing the sick to travel to the big, infectious, inhumane, bureaucratized corporate profit center.

                                Alzaebo—old bastard here—that’s the way it was when I was young and grew up in NYC.  Exactly that.  Our family doctor lived a block down the road in his private home where the front rooms were made into an office for drop in patients.He actually made “house calls” and carried that little black bag.  I hated/feared the guy since those house calls often were for my vaccinations.  Doorbell rang, he came in and I ran to the bedroom to lock him out.Brings back memories.  Saw him last when I was a young teen and visiting the old neighborhood.  He was a good man.

                            In these respects, I’m selfish.  I don’t know where this is going, but I don’t want to be forced to go along with it.  Socialize medicine any damn way you want it. As long as there is an option for me—as there will be for the wealthy class—to opt out or buy extended medical insurance to top off the government sponsored insurance.Right now, I pay for my own doctor, and I pay for an extended  medical plan to subsidize (top off) Medicare.  If I “wait” for treatment or diagnostics or a specialist, it’s voluntary on my part.  But in the main, I’ve been able to get services within days of requiring them.  I’d like everyone to have such, but this is America.

                                Agreed. I just think insurance needs to go back to being insurance. Briggs had a short article outlying in concise terms what my dad explained to me in ’73, when the HMO law went into effect. Dad said if that law didn’t get repealed, going to a doctor would become unaffordable in my lifetime.

                                    When the first born developed complications after birth—liver deficiency—common in premature situations, the hospital kept both mother and son for the required 24 hours, then *released* both of them with the admonishment to wife watch and see if the infant’s “jaundice ” gets worse.They sent over a nurse practitioner a couple of days later who declared an “emergency” and the infant was admitted as a patient for treatment of liver disease, although the infant was basically unchanged from release.  We of course were concerned, but never paid a penny due to insurance.Years later I was made “wise” to this ploy.  A birth, normal or not, is a “diagnostic reimbursement” category/group that pays the hospital “one” single amount, regardless of the ease or difficulty the procedure.  HMO’s started this.The hospitals responded with making sure that *all* births are treated alike.  In this case, they released the sick child and then a couple days later “discovered” a new DRG by which to bill for treatment.  I can imagine this does not work well for everyone.

        The system will not reform itself and will resist any external attempts to do so as the immune system treats a germ.   This is why BRICS and dedollarization are important.   It will take decades, but without slowly starving the beast of financial oxygen, nothing can change.Competent white men shrugging off the military, et.al. is the most that can be done domestically.   Trump is there to open normie eyes and rustle establishment jimmies, and that will have to be enough.  Once things are bad enough one of two things may happen:  the mob will rush in and re-enact the French or Russian Terrors or a new spaghetti/mustache man will arise.   Not exactly the same, but it will rhyme.   Humans are dumb and unimaginative.

            I’m not sure if I agree with the “dedollarization will take decades” part. A slightly leftish trader vid pointed out China’s response to Trump’s threat of 100% tariffs to any BRIC dedollarizing: they’ll simply sanction us back.They’ll cut off most of the essential metals used in electronics, gallium, antimony, copper, etc., and then dump our Treasuries on the secondary market.Not just the manufacturers but the replacement parts for control systems will be affected, and our dollar will be a scrap of paper. They’ll exploit the rest-of-the-world market they’re trying to reach anyways, while we’ll need to work through third parties like Russia and Iran do now.China is offering loans to those countries based on the carry trade, they can sell our Treasuries to them so the other countries can pay off their US debt.Bad, but necessary, I think. We’ve got to break the Federal Reserve grip somehow, as it’s debt crash seems inevitable (thus the Blackrock/government move to stablecoin.) We’d end up going back to simpler, more robust, more realistic (no NetZero New Green Deals) and to self-reliance for the essential resources.Update:  China discovers massive gold find.Uh-oh.  The gods have spoken.  China and the BRICS Axis now have the precious metals backing to break free of the BIS banks.  As Jack Dobson predicted, the dollar might just become an app like CashApp or Chime.

                The dollar only goes to crap if Trump follows through on his silly threat. Silly because even if we could bring all that manufacturing back on-shore, it would take years. And in the meantime, everyone is either doing without, including spare parts to keep whatever we already have functional, or is paying at least double, which means they have that much less for anything else.
All the dollar really loses is the ability to force inflation on the world. Congress’ deficit spending would impact Americans here and now, which is the only way to rein them in short of nukes…

                    Yep.  In short you are saying dedollarization is in our own interest.  I tend to believe this as well. If Congress had spine or true power, perhaps the pain might be lessened.  If reform can not come from within, it must be imposed from outside.

            Hear, hear. The belief that Obama is anything other than a lawn jockey for the Ruling Class simply reflects a wildly misplaced belief that somehow the system works and elections matter. Obama’s Step ‘n Fetchit Act is quite transparent. The only reason to vote is to force the system to further discredit itself by ignoring the results if not outright fixing the outcome.

                That’s exactly what I was thinking. What if the eight years of Trump are all just an exercise in letting them expose themselves? Trump trolls them with something a broad cross-section of the American public wants, they ignore him, cynicism builds. Rinse, wash, repeat. Maybe that’s what this is all about.

                    I suspect it is inadvertent but that’s the end result. Young white males refusing to degrade and debase themselves with military “service” is one early positive outcome. My fear is Trump was allowed to win to lure that demographic back into the meatgrinder, but that seems unlikely to work, fortunately.

                        I started to suspect that Trump would win in the wake of Oct. 7. The Left establishment couldn’t fully control their brown hoard and young liberal whites.
The GOP was rock solid for MIGA. (It’s also when the big money decided that identity politics was bad and colorblind civic nationalism was good. Funny that.)

                            Yes. Also note the UK and continental European governments are making similar moves back toward CivNattery.

            There might be some lessons, or at least an example, given by the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 90’s. People left without pensions. Military not paid for months. Rampant looting of State facilities. Zombies going through the motions of a functioning State, which included a functioning—of sorts—State Duma. The difference here however would seem the local/indivdual US States, which have all the trappings of a complete and independent nation state. I assume they will step up and retain order within their borders.

                Some of the oblasts managed pretty well. The better of the oblasts did about what I would expect from a median US state. Cali and Illinois and Mass will likely suck big time Wyoming and South Dakota might not even notice DC is gone for quite a while. Other than locals might notice a lot less personnel in the towns near Ellsworth and Cheyenne Mountain.

Don’t kid yourself. They’re all on the teat from the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior.
Farmers and rural white people were the first people to get hooked on the New Deal government teat… they paved they way for the blacks to get on it thirty years later.

                        Fun fact — well over 90% of the “Farm Bill” goes to SNAP. What used to be called Food Stamps. The most recent one has an estimated 10-year price tag of around $1.4 trillion, and SNAP is around $120 billion a year. Do the math on that with just the baseline budgeting of 8% and see how much that leaves.
Almost all of the “Farm Bill” goes to keeping the useless livestock in the blue cities pacified.

        “Exactly no one cares that the people have spoken.”This subject is worthy of the bully pulpit Trump has used to move the Overton window to the right in so many areas. People simply don’t understand the nuts and bolts of how our federal government works and how little of a voice we have in it. It’s a runaway freight train that does what it wants and nobody can do a thing about it, especially since people of our mindset are represented by cucks who stab us in the back at the first opportunity. (See the recent Mitch McConnell statements about recess appointments and what Joni Ernst just said the other day.)We are getting closer and closer to French Revolution time by the day.

        I highly recommend reading “The Ethnostate” by Wilmot Robertsonhttps://christiansfortruth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Ethnostate.pdfIt’s part of the excellent Colchester Collection:https://www.colchestercollection.com/subjects/white-identity.htmlp. 201“We must learn to filter noise through our consciousness in such a way that we hear the sense of what is being said without the pejorative trimmings, much as encrypted television signals destined for home satellite receivers have to be descrambled before we see the picture. We must somehow build an inner audio and video receiver that immediately recognizes and automatically tunes out false news. A first step is to amplify our skepticism. Nothing that emanates from a columnist, an editorial writer or a reporter should ever be taken for granted. What is omitted from press reports and television news should be noted just as carefully as what is printed or broadcast.”

            Well stated.  My response has been for a long time to listen and to play a mind game.  The game is to analyze—almost simultaneously—the factual and logical inconsistencies in what is being said and the position taken.  This knife “cuts both ways”.  Conservative babble also is more often than not inconsistent or illogical itself.  It is the pleasant lie that I spoke about above, however nonetheless deceptive and therefore corrosive.

True, but is this not the/an inconsistency I spoke of above? How does the average “Joe” know the truth to disprove the lie? So we’d seem back to the point of critical thinking skills of which, “Not everybody has all the information and reasoning skills to do that.”
I am not trying to be a clever Sophist here. Your point is spot on. I have no good answer and only expressing my own frustration. Those with better understanding should enlighten me.

        Alphabet is a perfect example of the bribery and corruption of the federal government. I’ve been having a problem with my adblocker on youtube. So I keep seeing scam ads. Just one scam after another. Google/youtube is being paid to run these scam ads to me (these are not youtube videos by a channel, they are the ads that run before the video plays. This also means you cannot link the ad and send it to a congressman or the FCC or any consumer protection agencies state or federal). WHY is this allowed to continue? Youtube/google/Alphabet should be financially and criminally liable for these scams. They have a duty of care not to push scam ads to its users. I’ve never seen scam ads on network TV. The FCC would stop it. The networks, as bad as they are, prevent scam ads. Youtube does nothing to stop the scam ads and heavily pushes them. They should be in prison and every person ripped off by a youtube or other google scam ad should have a claim against Alphabet/google/youtube.But they own Congress and so this cannot happen.

            Probably true. If they have the ability to review and censor the, I don’t know, millions? of hours of video uploaded every hour, they certainly have the ability to review the vastly smaller number of ads they sell.

        Just listening to this on Saturday morning but I have to say that P.J. O’Rourke, as much of a civ-nat as he was, was very capable of writing funny stuff.The National Lampoonof the late 70’s is a treasure of American humor. If reading “Foreigners From Around The World” doesn’t make you at least giggle, if not bust a gut, you’re probably bereft of a sense of humor.

        Listening to Lavrov with Tucker, I do know one thing: the greatest goal of our Enemies dire has been accomplished.
The White world will never unite.  The ties between East and West, potentially the greatest land (and sea) pan-White ummah are sundered.
As Lavrov said, they cannot trust us.  The Union of the penultimate race has been killed dead in its tracks.
Note that this is the strategy behind Western warmaking for all of the 20th century: block any competitors from forming.

        The Tennessee presidential candidate with the flannel shirt (who also took “six months off” to live down under) was Lamar! (with an exclamation point).
