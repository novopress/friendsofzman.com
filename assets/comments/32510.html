        Interesting show. Thanks, Z.There is a family in the town where I live who locked themselves away for nearly two years during covid. Their small children weren’t permitted to go outside. When the husband finally emerged, he was 75 pounds heavier and none the wiser.They had a Biden/Harris sign in their yard and when Biden stepped down, they immediately lobbed off the top half of the sign to remove his name. It’s hilarious to see the ridiculous and shoddy “Harris” sign next to the tranny flag.Maybe all the screens leftists own display Kamala Headroom, cackling away as she repeats “…unburdened by what has been…”Have a great weekend!

            The seamless transitions from the Current Thing are simultaneously terrifying and fascinating. People like your neighbors wouldn’t think twice about the need for you and yours to be murdered, and might even be willing to do the deed themselves. It is shocking to realize how many are like them.

                A lady across the block complained to our HOA that she wanted our Pro-life sign taken down, since we were in the corner and she said it it looked like it was the political stance of the entire neighborhood. She, of course, has plenty of shitlib signs on her lawn.
Their minds have been completely wiped clean by the GAE. The only option is to gain power and install new programming.

                        I saw a clip of Phil Collins on The Tonight Show, from 1985 this morning.  At one point they introduced Julian Lennon, sitting in the audience.  They put the camera on him and he was wearing a Confederate battle cap. “Can you imagine if that were today?…”
We’ve allowed these mutants to invade not just our lands but our very minute-by-minute existence.

                                In 1985 almost nobody pretended Confederate symbolism was racist (or “about slavery” or whatever). It was normal dude regalia.Pop music had become exceptionally gay and British, and rock guys’ response to that was to become American. The strong form of American is Southern. Tom Petty famously rejected “Boys of Summer,” written by his guitarist, because it was too Depeche Mode to fit on theplantation-themed concept albumhe was making.Anyway, people are their parents. The Lennons junior are the sons of an angry working-class white man with an outlier IQ, so they’re likely to be “based”—and Sean, his child with a crazy Japanese aristocrat, actually is. Unfortunately Julian, the all-British son, has ridden his father’s name into becoming a globohomo “philanthropist.”The internet should make him apologize for wearing the hat.Footage has resurfaced…

                                    Yes, the Dukes of Hazzard finished up its run the same year Julian appeared with the hat. It was socially acceptable then.

                                        Confederate iconography was still prominent in professional wrestling during that era, most notably by the original Fabulous Freebirds.

                                                Like most, they were both heels and babyfaces.  But they were the biggest villians in wrestling during their 1983-1984 feud with local heroes, the Von Erichs, in the Dallas-based World Class territory.  However, in the summer of 1984, they also had an abortive run in the expanding WWF and were assiciated with Cyndi Lauper and her real-life manager and boyfriend Dave Wolff.  Does anyone want to ask uber-liberal Cyndi how she could associate herself with the Stars And Bars?

                                Yeah, saw that. Lennon was obviously being deliberately transgressive by saying “N!gger” on national television as often as he can. The high-school-tier, adolescent snark is obvious.

            I live in a dyed in the wool blue city.  Someone in our hood put up a Trump sign in one of the medians and I thought to myself, that won’t last a day.  Sure enough, the next morning it was history.  The leftards just can’t help themselves…

                My office mate lives on a rural, very traditionally conservative road, in a county that voted nearly 70% for Trump.  Four years ago he had a Trump sign out on his front yard.  One day he received an anonymous letter in the mail to the effect of “Thank you for helping us identify the houses that support the Orange Hitler.  We’ve made note.”
Even when they’re a tiny minority, they won’t stop plotting against us.  Not for our conversion, mind you, but for our demise.

                    There’s a guy not far from me, rides bike a lot. In ‘20 he was yelling at people with Trump signs as he rode past. Somebody called the cops, the cops investigated. I heard he was making a map. I don’t think he was arrested, but he stopped. Actually rode around waving and apologizing to people.

This is the thing about the Left: the melt and curl into the fetal position when countered. The problem with the Right is they historically have waited too long to throw that punch.

                Tired Citizen:  Problem is, that type massively outnumber us.  And by “us” I don’t mean those who like to call themselves dissident right, but still insist on muh democracy or Asian wives or IKAGOs.  It’s nice to imagine a society of common sense, self-aware White people who aren’t willing to compromise on genuinely vital things, but that gets you labelled a “purity spiraler” and similar accusations.You either need to learn to live with the stupid, lazy, and lame, or separate from them.  My husband knows how to charm these people, while privately venting his spleen at home where I can empathize.  I lack the patience and ability to pretend to put up with them, and so we now happily live far away from most people.  He recently had to spend a week in a big blue city for work, and could not wait to get home.  Not just away from the POX, but from oblivious normie colleagues as well.   Pretending can only be kept up for so long.

                    Nah. Midterms are always low turnout. Special elections even worse. States and counties with odd-year elections are often barely out of single digits.
The things (s)elected by less than 10% of the populace get just as much of a vote as the ones in districts that get out 124% of the electorate.
They laugh at your withholding of “legitimacy”.

                I find the whole presidential electoral process a massive bore. Even before it became the disgusting carny show it is now, it was duller than watching paint dry. Watching stupid presidential candidates flip pancakes in Iowa and hearing those dry stump speeches makes me want to jump off a bridge.
And it takes far too long. The Iowa caucuses were in January and there’s been nothing but talk about this election.
I’m glad I live in the mountains and can turn the phone off, walk in the woods, work on our land and just unplug.

                    When I pay attention to the campaign, I feel distress because I am reminded that at least half the country believes things that seem wildly false to me: that Kamala is smart and accomplished, that our economy and job market are in great shape, and that the border is secure.
It’s like hearing half the country assert with great conviction that the sky is green and the oceans are red. It’s disorienting to the point of nausea.
(I’m glad that I live in the mountains too…)

                                Timothy Busfield and Melissa (((Gilbert))) moved boldly to Howell, Michigan, just down to road from Hell, Michigan, in order to convince the town to suicide. I am well-acquainted with Howell, and it is the former temporary HQ of the KKK. Busfield-Gilbert failed uber hard.
Howell are the true Highlanders.

                Quitting sportsball is easy compared to elections.  Sportsball you must tune into in designated time spots or buy tickets to specifically arranged events.  Even the news has a 5 minute segment of time to discuss such which you can avoid.  Is this the same for politics?Here the airwaves and talking heads regale the audience with the latest from the political front.  Entire radio shows are now dedicated to such “discussion”.  On television—and radio—ad spots pot up every 7-10 minutes with political pitches.  Even on the Internet, any app that makes a dollar by selling your eyeballs, runs political ad’s.  Road and yard signs are ubiquitous these days and will continue on until elections are over.Hell, this blog itself rarely fails to have a comment or two related to politics, regardless of the topic at hand.The only way to avoid the clown show is to hide away in a cabin in the woods.  Otherwise, you simply need to endure it until it passes.  Politics seems like the weather.  You can’t change it, you can’t avoid it, you can only endure it until it passes.  And now that elections are contested/considered as fraudulent, political discussion/contention seems unending.

                    True. And as Z has pointed out, this is the inevitable outcome of democracy wherein political participation is considered a moral duty, even for those who are stupid, mad, juvenile or just plain uninterested. Having said that, while we cannot eliminate our exposure to politics any more than we can eliminate exposure to the lumpenkultur, we can limit it by simply avoiding digital media and screens of all sorts. This is how I deflect most of the kultur.

                        The problem is that ignoring it all does not make the commissars leave you alone. It just breeds more of them, all clamoring for your stuff.
It’s not that it’s become some moral duty, but rather a formalized process of plunder. Voting becomes a rational act, as you are voting your tribe a greater share of the plunder.

Yeah, I swore off voting in ’86, only to give it one more chance in ’92 to put Jesse Ventura in as Minnesota’s governor.
Paraphrasing Fred Reed, vote for the most absurd candidate to maximize the humor. I might be tempted to go back to the polls to elect Alex Jones. Probably not for anything less.

                                        I fear you underestimate her. No one talked about her laugh until she got installed as VP. Then that came from MSM, not Breitbart. My hypothesis — to distract you from noticing the radical politics. So long as you focus on the absurd, you will never see the danger until its too late.
I don’t believe she has ever lost an election. Twice as SF DA, twice as CA AG, once as US Senate, then VP. (She dropped out before the first primary in 2020.)

                    Compsci: “Quitting sportsball is easy compared to elections.“A day or two ago, I was scrolling through Z’s “Baseball” thread, and my jaw dropped when I noticed that the Cleveland Indians are now the Cleveland “Guardians”.I’m so happy to be oblivious to all that Normie nonsense.God bless their little Normie hearts, but Talmudvision must be more real to the Normies than is reality itself.That’s all I can figure; that the Frankfurt School &amp; the Council of the Sanhedrin have so perfectly perfected the recipes for mesmerization &amp; hypnotization of the goyim that the entire charade is getting to be simply boring for the Sanhedrin.I hope the Sanhedrin don’t decide that they need a great big Dopamine Hit to remind themselves of the Old Days, when they had to struggle to control the shkotzim; a Dopamine Hit along the lines of a Monkey Pox Pandemic or a Thermonukular War, or simply slaughtering all the First Born Sons of the White race, like they did to those poor boys in Egypt, and again to their very own sons in Bethlehem.Coventry Carol, Original Version of 1591https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBs-IoQvhBI

                    I disagree Ostei.
I think that it is less likely that there will be a gun grab if Trump is elected. Any other Republican, yes. Trump, no.
We do have a two party system, but not configured as once they were.
Republican + Democrat = Uniparty.
MAGA = Populist Party
The new two party system is composed of the Uniparty and the MAGA Party.

                        I wish that were the case, but I’m afraid the cost of Trump becoming prez again, or perhaps for just not being assassinated, is him being compromised into the Power Structure. Sure, he may campaign as if he’s the same old MAGAman, but it’ll be merely an artifice to grease the skids that lead to the Anti-White House.

                            Agreed. But it really is the same old heads you win, tails you lose reality. I certainly don’t think the Regime will intervene of Trump’s behalf, to be clear, but it may stay neutral if the outcome doesn’t matter, which is what I think. The real question is if leftists/Democrats blatantly cheat as emergent behavior and it is too obvious to deny. That’s when things get real.

                                    Indeed. Case in point: the Chinese Communist Party had to shoot dead the largely female deadenders of the Cultural Revolution. Our Regime is just as vicious and it really is a possibility they have unleashed a problem population that will require a similar approach.

                        Blue states aren’t “grabbing” guns, they’re banning the sale of stuff they don’t want you to have and forcing existing owners to register them if they want to keep them without incurring felony charges.
The strategy is that in one generation when the existing owners die off, the state takes the guns from the estate and nobody will ever be able to possess them again.
You know what? It’s working, and the courts haven’t stopped them.
I’ve seen people charged with felonies for having unregistered stuff with my own eyes. It’s no joke.

                                The problem is that the transition to one-party Blue states has been very quick. New York and California had Republican governors until 2006. New York had a Republican Senate until 2008. Illinois, Colorado, Maryland, New Jersey and even Massachusetts were all in play 15-20 years ago.
Conversely you could live in Mississippi, which has been solidly Republican for 30+ years, but the state population is 1/3 black.
Shitlibs have captured the institutionseverywhere. Look at Austin. Not exactly the “Texas” of lore.

                                    Yes, they’ve captured the instutions in Texas, just the same as in California. But the difference is in the hinterlands. For the time being, nobody’s going to the hoosegow for owning an unregistered piece in West Texas. I might not want to run that risk in New Jersey.
PS–Texans do not consider Austin to be a part of Texas. Rather, it’s seen as a metastatic tumor from California that most of us would dearly love to treat with the most radical form of chemo…

                                            Thanks, JZ. Lived here 50 of my 57 years and have no great urge to leave. The landscape, as you say, is flat, albeit with fairly dramatic canyons appearing in spots. The flatness, however, makes possible incredible skyscapes. There’s not much more impressive in my book, than a massive wall of thunderheads rolling in from the New Mexico state line. And the resulting rain is always celebrated with fervent intensity.PS–All of West Texas, is not flat, however. The trans-Pecos area (largely devoid of trannies) contains Texas’ only real mountains, a few of which approach 9K feet of elevation. It’s more like southern New Mexico than the rest of Texas.

                                        “nobody’s going to the hoosegow for owning an unregistered piece in West Texas”If it’s a Class III NFA item they sure as hell will.That’s the thing about gun control, Red state people sneer at the Blue staters, but then they stand in line and pay hundreds of dollars to say “Mother, may I?” to the ATF to get a can, an SBR, or an auto-sear. And they fill out their 4473s and do their NICS checks just the same as anywhere else.The principle is the same everywhere: government calls the shots. You don’t have any “rights,” you have privileges. Those privileges are a bit more lenient in some states than in others, that’s all. People need to wake the hell up and realize that a Harris administration could ban semi-autos and demand federal registration of AR-15s in West Texas exactly the same way the queers in Sacramento and San Francisco forced gun control on Alturas and Yreka.

                Totally unnecessary. Many replies to you here already assert why. Door kickers going around at great peril to themselves attempting confiscation is a brainlet tier approach and totally pointless. It is FUDs that are really distressed about this mainly and they are of a stripe with the “collapse any day now” crowd. It is half wishful thinking and half fear.Reality is what others have posited- Ammo tax so exorbitant no one can afford to feed their iron. Regulations and rules that slowly squeeze at 2A in a lawfare way making inroads into purple states which is easy to do with as the population rapidly browns out and becomes scared lefty white ladies as the majority of the voter base.Guns non-inheritable upon owner death law. Within a generation or two they will be mostly gone. Kids today are mainly afraid of them due to relentless propaganda.Nogs of course totally exempt from all of the above because of “systemic racism” will get to keep their illegal ghetto blasters.And let’s be honest, what difference would it actually make? The proverbial “mountain of iron” that exists in the US is once again a FUD feel good amulet more than anything else. They sit rusty and unused from sea to shining sea anyways… ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

                    No one is going to use their guns to fight the government like 1775. There might be a few willing to take out a door-kicker or two in what will amount to an act of suicide, but that’s it.
Nonetheless, guns are still 100% necessary to have to defend your home and your people when the ferals go apeshit and start looting, burning it down and trying to kill you and the cops have long since disappeared.
LA, Katrina and the Summer of Floyd indicate that this is not a merely speculative concern.

                    All good points, Apex.
Having a firearm is a form of term life insurance, with the term of that policy being longer or shorter depending on who wins in November. I prefer a longer term and I think Trump may give us that.

                    Mass gun ownership probably drives up the price of uniformed goons and lowers the quality of the blue thugs. The great majority of owners pose no actual threat and are compulsive badge lickers, but the odd ducks, some literally insane, are always a possibility. It is a good bet that most guntards would surrender their weapons in a nanosecond if a “law” passed, but then the holdouts would be only those who would actually use them, and as a direct result the pigs would be even more prone to murder people in cold blood if a gun was thought present.From this cost/benefit analysis, gun ownership would be a very good thing even though largely a LARP.

                I’m all in for having firearms, of course, but in reality, they’ve already “grabbed” the guns.  Sure, you might be able to defend a loved one, or even yourself… Once.  If you have to shoot a feral negro, no matter what he was doing to you or your loved one, your life is over.  You will be bankrupted and sent to prison for the rest of your life.  So in essence, they don’t need to take the guns, they just need to make it a similar outcome whether you use it or not.

On the street, maybe. But the Castle Doctrine is strong enough even in Blue states that if he enters your house, it’s Game Over for him and you get no-billed.
The catch is that you can still get jammed up for a justifiable shoot if you do it with an “illegal” weapon.

The Secret Service, in thrall to the Deep State, is re-writing history before our very eyes.
This is sheerTrotskyism.
And Trotskyism can’t be defeated by running away and hiding in the woods.
Trotskyism can only be defeated when every last Trotskyite is hμnted down and k!11ed.
And that starts with the obliteration of the Praetorian Guard:

                Correct. Electoral politics is the spearpoint of the deranged carny act. Everything idiotic and diseased about AINO can be espied in the candidates and the campaigning. But this is an argument for abstention, not participation.

            I would agree with you – we’re not voting our way out of this – but for 2 things: Trump getting shot, and his picking JD Vance as his running mate. This could very well be the very last meaningful election, and certainly the last one with a personality the size of Trump. That gets all kinds of tongues wagging, even those on our side who would ignore the circus.I think the Dems did a good move by making Harris-Walz all sparkles and dreams and then painting Trump-Vance as gloomy and weird. Harris should have been easily beatable on stage and on the issues but the Democrats realized that feels and positivity sells where substance and righteousness does not.That’s why people give a shit. Harris can win, even without shenanigans.

        My only area of disagreement with the podcast is that I think that it is slightly unfair to the French court prior to July 1789.  Louis XVI was quite aware of the problems France faced and was trying to make reforms, but was blocked time and time again by aristocrats jealous of their own prerogatives.  And the “French Revolution” was not a peasant uprising, but more a coup d’état by the bougeoisie, who lost control of the leadership during the Terror.  Many of the stories of how disconnected the French court was from reality were created or exaggerated by later historians seeking to make the Bourbons look as bad as possible.  I would much rather by governed by Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette than by the present political “leadership” of the U.S.

            During my honeymoon in Paris, I went to the Conciergerie, where Marie Antoinette was imprisoned for her last days. Among all the propaganda about the French Revolution, there is a computer system where you can find the names of people killed by the revolution, only because they liked the King or they were Catholic. Lots of lots of people, but it’s OK because they were killed to achieve freedom, whatever this is. The handful of people killed by the Monarchy completely intolerable, even if they were real criminals.In addition, there is a marble block with relief-carved letters with the last words of Marie Antoinette, forgiving her enemies, saying people not to get revenge for her death. I was deeply moved. After that, I learned more about her and the 200 years of bullsh*t she has received. Things like “if they don’t have bread, let them eat cake”. She never pronounced that.

                There is a school of historiography on the French Revolution, spearheaded by the late great Francois Furet, that is highly critical of the revolution. They were in the ascendant in the 90s. Not sure if they still are.

        If we have to touch on generational politics (and sometimes we do), it’s probably worth mentioning that the “avatar-like” quality of the profiles you’re talking about is very much a Zoomer thing, not a Boomer thing. As a millennial, I was part of the last generation that knew meatspace as well as cyberspace. We even used to joke that you had to be careful about talking crap online, as the person you pissed off might have some IT skill, show up at your door and beat you down.For the Fuentes crowd, there is no door, or rather, the person you’re pissing off would only want to challenge you in in the virtual space you’re both already in. So you’re essentially in a consequence-free environment.That’s why adults warning about the actual consequences of a Kamala presidency are wasting their breath when talking to kids like Nick. Sure, the borders will be open, but how does that affect the screen I stare at all day? Sure, hiring preferences against white men will get worse, but even the poor get enough subsidies to keep the LCD screens glowing, and as long as you have those, you have your twenty-four hour fantasyland running. Who cares what your Door Dash driver looks like?But—as Z points out—kids are supposed to be dumb and do dumb stuff. The problem is that America—at least since the mid-twentieth century—has been a youth-centric culture. We look to the young not just with a little bit of longing for our own bygone youths, but for actual behavioral and cultural cues. It’s cringeworthy to see adults—middle-aged and older—peppering their speech with this slang and trying to dress young, but it’s also instructive. Ramzpaul is mystified by Fuentes’ cozying up to Kamala, but it makes a lot of sense in this context.Ultimately, she and Obama remind me of the head of the drug company in that old William Gibson cyberpunk story “Johnny Mnemonic.” He gives all these wonderful pronouncements and then finally when you see him, it’s literally just a guy’s hand, making mouth gestures with the fingers, with a graphical overlay of a human face to give the illusion that the hand is a head.The Kamala-Fetterman-Biden program seems to be the preferred one going forward. It hardly matters whether it started with Kennedy, Reagan, or Obama. They’re clearly not going to accept an autonomous decision-making creature in the position of presidency.

                    Like everything else in Trump’s presidency, that number is distorted by 2020. He was able to use “emergency” powers to shut down the border. Before that border crossings were in line with prior presidents and even exceeded them. The NGOs like HIAS revved up the caravans and the media concocted the “kids in cages” lines. That’s not to say that Trump didn’t have the will to do better, but like so many other things, he couldn’t get it done.

                Trump successfully halted the illegals through executive orders and arm twisting other countries to enforce their borders. He may be able to do so again. Who knows. That illegal migration is only part of the problem means we still will increase foreign born in this country somewhere around1.5M a year.
The real point, and that’s not certain, is that the migrants allowed in are vetted and of a contributory nature to the country. Sub normal IQ dirt scrapers now rushing the border are of no use.

                    as far as imconcerned, immigration isn’t worth discussing anymore.  The damage is done and there is no putting the toothpaste back in the tube.  You could seal off every point of entry with the world’s tallest gates preventing a single brown from entering and the country can’t be fixed.  It’s already been ruined.  This is the same thing as discussing removing women from politics.  Never in a million years is that happening, and neither is fixing the demographics.  Prepare accordingly to be a minority and to be persecuted.  Make a plan to move somewhere remote where there are others who are like minded and will do the same thing that you are willing to do to “trespassers”.

            ““avatar-like” quality of the profiles you’re talking about is very much a Zoomer thing, not a Boomer thing.”I politely disagree. We’ve all been talking in avatars for a long time. Ronald Regan and Trump anyone? Is TV real, in the way much of Boomers and older Gen X treat it?What’s different about the internet era is the ability to look up backstories to an extent. We can see that they avatars and that make it look different. The movie “Avatar” didn’t show a split screen with somebody hooked up to a computer or what not while the action played out in “reality”. But that’s very much what the Internet has the capability of showing.

            Ramz has taken a strong pro-GOP turn this year while claiming the GOP has come around to the policies he’s supported for years. His shilling went from Desantis to Vivek to Vance and recently he’s had a major stick up his ass in regards to NJF. Seems like Ramz’s trying to ingratiate himself to Tucker and that entire network. Interestingly, Tucker recently alluded to Nick being a fed, but of course couldn’t actually say his name. I wonder why. Nick is the only one trying to push Trump in the right direction, but has been universally castigated by the right for this effort. It has been a VERY enlightening spectacle to behold.

            “We even used to joke that you had to be careful about talking crap online, as the person you pissed off might have some IT skill, show up at your door and beat you down.”When I started, there was little to nothing that resembled what’s now called the Internet.  However, early attempts that resulted in what we now see, were just beginning and spreading from systems nerds, to students/faculty in the department and classes in IT.The Department Head was prescient and immediately issued guidelines for use of this new media.  One of the “rules” was everybody used their own name—no pseudonyms.  Folks hated this immediately, but were hard pressed to provide valid reasons why.  Another rule was to respect the good will of the new media and temper one’s communications as we’d expect from any “representative” of the department and university.One of my first duties was to “enforce” these rules.  First rule was easy as I created all accounts, second rule less so.  Almost immediately, we had a sociopath who began to troll other students in discussion groups with the most hateful and vile communication imaginable.  I’m not talking about spirited disagreements here where tempers may flare, but rather interjections on discussion threads specifically designed to emotionally hurt.For example, a student might remark that his parrot died and how sad it was and this guy would come back with remarks about poor “Polly” being dead and it was the student’s fault for having a GD parrot in the first place rather than a “manly” dog and then calling him a “faggot”.  This went on and finally, I deleted his account.  He threatened me with taking his “case” to the Dean and I simply responded, “Great, and while we’re there, I’ll have the Dean read all your postings and you can explain to him exactly why these are you right to post on our systems as part of your educational experience”.Well, he didn’t take me up on the Dean visit, but he did report me toElectronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).  I went a round or two with them and I am now immortalized on their listing of anti free speech bigots along with all my correspondence.  Not checked with them in 25 years or so, but they don’t seem to have been effective in casting me into the void.  No one ever mentioned them to me in my career.  😉

        In Medieval times, monks who only wanted to live in the woods would be made Bishops and Popes against their objections. A lot of times, not wanting to take leadership roles proved you had the humility to be a good leader.
Biden tried this with his “I wanted to retire but Charlottesville forced me to reenter the ring.” Nonsense of course, but there’s still that urge to create the reluctant hero backstory in modern times.

            If you’re the Alan Schmidt who wrote “Calvin vs. Susie” that I read a bit ago and shared with my husband, Bravo.  Brilliantly written, and unutterably sad.  I don’t see any ‘fix’ other than a major crash and many years of awful, miserable times.

        I think the manufactured illusion of Leftist unity around Quasi-President Quadroon is going to have a very short life. The pro-Palestinian faction is bound and determined to do some street action in Chicago, which will cause the pro-Bagel faction to demand retaliation, along with the Robber Baron faction, the Apparat faction and the Spiteful Mutant faction all rapidly remembering how much they hate Harris and each other.

            Yeah, we’ve seen some indication here and there of that already happening. The retarded economic pronouncements appear to be emergent behavior yet probably make the Robber Barons a little concerned (a good thing in and of itself even though they never will happen short of a violent, no-shit leftist revolution). The DNC will be locked down tighter than a drum but, yeah, there will be some on the floor who let their Pali freak flags fly even then. It will be interesting to see if they can get past the “media” cordon sanitaire.I think you are correct in the short shelf life, but that may prove to Trump’s detriment. Remember, he is scheduled for sentencing on, ironically enough, September 11. He most likely will be incarcerated if it looks like he is poised to win. That could backfire, of course.

            Well I hope you are right PR.Like Z I am amazed that all these retarded fictions are actually flying at this point. Biden has dropped right off the radar despite his massive involvement in corruption, incompetence and the doings of his harelipped retard of a son.It makes me wonder how big of an object that can be made to disappear. I remember the magicians years ago competing similarly: one made a 747 jet liner disappear, and another made the statue of liberty disappear later in a game of one-upmanship. I bet these guys could make them look like pikers and make the Whitehouse disappear!Poof! Magic!!! He’s gone!!! No word about who is actually running the country, who tried to kill Trump (the wanks are saying they already cremated the perp’s carcass), and the cover ups are blatantly obvious even to the lowest of the underclass – who are seeing their gibs going to new imported democrat voaters. Your next election is going to be lit!

        Just a funny aside, but I was doing some business networking yesterday. I met this Jewish guy in his 30’s. He was telling me how he went to college at Alabama and always gets asked if people really do hate Jews down there. That got me off on the tangent of sharing some of the quirks of history I know about, such as how the KKK didn’t really have a problem with their local Jews. It was the carpetbaggers from the north, who were predominantly Jewish, that they despised.I was razzing him a little bit about how whether his people are white or not depends on what benefits them the most at any given time and what is most convenient at the time. Believe it or not, he laughed and agreed.

        Harris is the candidate of Pelosi and Obama. That’s it. That is her base. She won not a single delegate. Its just being handed to her.That might have worked in 2008, or 2000. But that was years ago.Now her candidacy is for wage and price controls. That is going to unite BigCorp against her, as they understand that they will have to be in an endless bribery race with shadowy people they cannot even identify (it is clear that like Biden, Kamala will not really be the President if she wins which is a feature not a bug of her candidacy). Which means a very good chance that their competitor will “win” and they will “lose” in the bribery race.There are others who suspect that the wage/price controls will be used to obliterate US industry in favor of China, so they lose the China hawks. Tampon Timmy is very close to China, which makes BigDefense very unhappy. Silicon Valley is mostly Trump now out of fear and loathing for Pelosi/Obama’s punitive policies.The Media is united against Trump for Kamala, but does that matter anymore? It is not 2008, after all Paramount is closing their TV production studio, and has devalued their TV holdings by $6 billion from a prior $7 billion, meaning CBS and MTV etc are only worth $1 billion. Warners Discovery took a $9 billion write down, and was not able to bid on the NBA rights.Its like the Ukraine Kursk “invasion” — the media spins a catastrophe for Putin, with 200,000 or more evacuated, and Zelensky marching on to Moscow to overthrow Putin. In reality its more guerilla warfare with UK spec ops teams in Ukraine uniforms committing atrocities as the huge front has most Russian forces in the East around Donbass where they are grinding the Ukrainians down. Putin has not even created a national mobilization. In reality the few dudes on motorcycles are eventually going to be hunted down by a limited mobilization and the prospect of a negotiated settlement will be dead (the true objective of the offensive).People have tuned out the media not just because of generations of lies but because their stuff is ugly, boring, and they have limitless alternatives in YT, Rumble, etc.Harris has no base. “She is brat” will generate the lackluster enthusiasm for Charlie XCX, among young women who say they vote but mostly don’t. Noteworthy is that the more female-brat stuff the media pushes, the more dudes vote Trump to stem the estrogen tide.

        I overcame oppression therefore I am heroic. This is just vanity. Lying in order to declare yourself a hero, and people lap it up. It is the latter part of this that is more contemptible than the former. Harpo the Great! So Harpo is a hero, and Men who got in ships, sailed off into the total unknown on vast dangerous oceans, charted courses, water and wind currents, tides, the movement of heavenly bodies are evil. (Columbus, Drake, Magellan, deGama … … …)Take out all the fancy analysis and philosophy and that is the bottom line.As for Profilicity we have words for both sides of this:The Actor: a charade; a ruse; feigning; deceiver; manipulator; liarThe Actor and the Profile Consumer: buffoon; a tool; deluded;In addition to ZMan’s point about the philosopher’s inability to point out the lack of any truth value in Profilicity, is something else worth pointing out. The professor did admit that he too is a profilist, though I think he underestimated the extent to which he is, to borrow his terms, is bound up in it.He, in my opinion, is a shining example of why The West is in such an existential crisis. That clip of Harris and those children is less an example of profilism, it is a display of a deeply sinister and evil ruling regime and its methodology. He watches this display of psychopathy and sinister manipulation of children and draws from it his supporting evidence of Profilism. He concludes with his own Profilism with his derivative 7 rules that amount to full acceptance of these displays of malevolent evil.In short, he has no value judgement when confronting this evil. He refuses to call this out and pass a value judgement and assert some moral value. It is this passive and valueless and thus bereft of morality from an academic who should be making assertions, particularly in the face of the constant anti-morality of pseudo-academics.In other words. He is a coward, a cuck. He fits the profile of a Westman who has forfeited his moral authority and his agency – probably in order that he may peddle his 7 Rules and ride the wave of profits he’ll garner if he is credited with this sub-midwittery first.I hope ZMan is right and we are nearing the end. I want to be optimistic. I fear that the ride down will be long and that what we are seeing is not the transition of decay, but a planned transition into the new and highly controlled future of degradation that The Regime has capably planned for us. That future will not last forever, but the damage it can do is a catastrophic horror to even contemplate.

        Cerno, Beale, and that whole alt-right network have got to be a weird ass psyop. Tucker’s dad was the Voice of the People (propaganda arm of the U.S. govt) and you’re probably aware he went out for the CIA.I also don’t believe the Cerno/Dersh cover story about how they don’t know each other…Dersh just ended up in Cerno’s lame documentary and then both going after Epstein documents in a way suggesting it was about the victims’ info, if I recall.What I don’t understand is why they give him any air time. His character is a queer mix of nothing. If he isn’t a propaganda tool why the fuck give him air time? If he is, why give him air time?Can someone here explain why Z thought Beale was lying about Patreon?

        The problem of Plato’s cave is something I’ve been thinking about a lot lately. The fact is that people DO have the ability to live in an artificial reality based on shadow-myths for a LONG time.Yes, ultimately reality will bring the whole thing crashing down, but the myths can go on for centuries until it does.Imagine yourself as a pre-Columbian Aztec, sitting around with your buddies and saying one day “Ya know, I got my doubts about the sacrifice thing. We sacrificed a thousand dudes to the sun god last year and the maize crop was worse this year than last. I don’t think it’s working.”Your buddies would say “Naw, dude, c’mon! Buck up. Sun god just needs a few more sacrifices, then he’ll be happy and we’ll get a bumper crop of maize. Come on down with us to the festival tonight, there’ll be singing, dancing, lots to eat, plenty of babes. Ya might even meet some hottie and get laid tonight after the sacrifice!”If you persisted in questioning the rituals, or opposed the priests and publicly called them frauds and charlatans, YOU’D be the next guy on the altar, guaranteed.That is the lesson of Socrates, and of Christ.Sure, Cortez came along and brought the whole thing to a crashing halt. But the arrival of the Spaniards was an unpredictable, exogenous force. The entire culture built upon the sacrifice hoax lasted for hundreds of years before Cortez arrived. It was never reformed from within.And Cortez replaced it with a bullshit myth of his own, namely that instead of taking an obsidian knife and hacking the heart out of a living person, a guy in robes chanting in Latin would perform the miracle of making wine into the actual blood of Christ, which you would drink to save your soul.Did that make you a vampire, then? Better to not ask.If God created the world out of nothing and then created “Man in His own image,” that means that Man is able to create “reality” out of nothing, too. And that is what Man does. Since Man is not God he is unable to see when and how his artificial reality will be destroyed by “real reality,” as is invariably the case.I have no answer for this other than to just check out of the bullshit and head for the hills. The myth of the wise old hermit who knows The Truth living alone on the mountain may becliché,yet it exists for a reason. But man is a social animal, such hermitage is not suitable for the vast majority of the population, and that majority lives according tot he shadow-myths just as if they were real.

        “Cerno would warrant national attention. He was nothing more than a weird internet character.”
A weird internet character who was coaching all kinds of misfits on how to pick up women and himself once had sex with a tranny. (But he was ridiculed for this and tried to scrub the post.) His family runs a junkyard in Kewanee, Illinois, so I always assumed he was Jewish, but I think he might be a from a Serbian or Croatian background.

            Yep, unlike our esteemed blog host, who is a critical modern thinker – that whole pack of goofs are failed performance artists. Richard Spencer, Vox Day, Milo… they play well to the incels, cellar dwellers, and confused kids… but so do Jordan Peterson, Ben Shapro, Matt Walsh and the other cucks and controlled clowns.
I hate seeing Tucker fall into that. I’d like to think he could actually be a good voice for our cause but money is money and he has to do what he has to do too I guess.

                    Yeah I remember that. I kinda sorta followed him for awhile when he claimed to have broken that story when Blumpf’s Goons supposedly assaulted a female reporter. Cerno or someone caught the incident on tape, where a body guard gently brushed her out of the way and the media was stunned to learn that there were other cameras besides theirs at these events, and the attempted narrative failed. I gave up when he started orbiting the clowns that undermined the old Alt Right movement…

        Excellent podcast. I agree, the problem with the gaslighting is that it is inversely proportional to the quality of the product. Meaning, the more heavily hyped a product, the worse it usually is. This happens especially with products everyone hears about, BUT NOBODY THEY KNOW ACTUALLY HAS ONE.The beauty of the insane levels of media coordination is that consumers (ie voters) intuitively understand this concept, even if they cannot articulate it. The Harris hype will snag some early adopters. But the early adopters exist to shake the bugs out of an expensive product, but they can also quickly destroy the product’s brand.I’ve said since Week 1, “Give it a few weeks.” Eventually, things settle back down. It is why, until he fell in Las Vegas, Biden was not dropping out of the race. It was not going to happen. The insane media storm had already stated to fade. And then…oopsie. If he hadn’t fallen or had a spell (which opened the door for people to write those Tweets for him), he’d still be running.Survive the blitzkrieg, and you stand a very good chance of winning the war through a combination of Kamala-fatigue and Reality. They are DESPERATELY trying to keep her away from unscripted situations. I would argue that the level of media hype is an indicator of EXTREME PANIC about her stupidity making itself public.What we are watching is the media equivalent of the “Zerg Rush” from video games.https://www.dailydot.com/memes/zerg-rush-meaning-origins-and-use/Sooner or later, people log off their pretend world to buy eggs, or gas, or notice all the crime and homeless and foreigners, and reality sets in. The web is escapism.The bigger the gap between the world around you and the Avatar world you’ve fabricated online, the harder it is to maintain the illusion of online reality. Gravity always wins, as I like to say.Notice how Trump keeps giving press conferences…they’re trying to flush her out.

        You sound like you’d look like Donald Barthelme, the only author whose books I’ve read enough times to physically destroy them (two copies of my favorites). So I assume you don’t look like that. But the vague man in my head when I listen to the podcast is pretty much him.He’s a good representative of how, bad as it always was, “media” has fallen over our lifetime. He was the New Yorker’s house short fiction writer, so probably the world’s most popular one—and he was thebestone, literarily, the most interesting and innovative, the least likely to produce a clunker. Today we get “Cat Person,” with not a single writerly sentence in it—and faked viral interest in “Cat Person,” and admonishment that if you don’t like “Cat Person” you’re a nazi incel.I even saw Barthelme on TV once (probably on George Plimpton’s show). Successful avant-garde writers! On your newsstand and in your living room! Different world. I was raised to live in that one, but by the time I got there the carnival had packed off.

        Brilliant, man.I don’t think Harris will win outright, but of course she could “win.” No one mentions it but even amid the ferocious propaganda campaign she has never been ahead, to the extent anything can be believed, for a nanosecond in the Electoral College. That may be claimed during or in the immediate aftermath of the DNC and likely will be, but so far it has not been so the topic has been largely avoided. I’ve tended to think of late the Regime actually might accept a Trump win albeit for purposes that may be alarming. For example, Trump might be useful to gull young white males into fighting for Our Greatest Ally. I don’t think even he could pull that off at this point, to be clear, but just suggesting motivation. The Regime certainly prefers Harris but may find Trump palatable and potentially useful enough not to interfere as much on her behalf. Dunno.The more interesting part, given politics are fake and gay and meaningless at this point (if not this time, soon enough Harris types will win legitimately every time), is as you point out the susceptibility of people to blatant distortions of reality. Prolificity is indeed a good explanation although it overlaps greatly with propaganda and marketing. Yes, people may notice soon enough that no one they know in life is voting for Harris, but they can be persuaded multitudes are doing so. Covid should have ended this naivete/infantilism, but we saw much of it repeated with the Ukraine war, to cite one example from the aftermath. There also is no shortage of people who believe blatant lies for the simple reason they want to believe them. They very well may be the vast majority.The immoral and shameless sociopaths who play even minor internet influencer roles in these charades are legion. We have learned even public people we assumed had at least some knowledge and insight are devoid of it but more than willing to pretend they possess great wisdom. It required rampant immorality to have endless propagandists who promote lies as truth, whether in politics, media, business, culture or government. A system with that much rot cannot survive and is in fact going away, and it appears what follows even may be worse.A final and unrelated point about AI. The fear has been it would manipulate people in politics, culture and matters of life and death, and that has indeed happened. Oddly, though, it causes everything to be doubted and assumed to be fraudulent, even things that are objectively true. That may prove to be an unexpected silver lining even if not a silver bullet.

            “AI…it causes everything to be doubted and assumed to be fraudulent,…”There’s that bubble again. Everything you said is true, but the implicit assumption underlying your insight may not be. That is to say, everyone may not retain the doubt for AI that you rightly have. I’d say the danger is really in that, the gullibility (ignorance) of the public. Or perhaps simply the assumption of “critical thinking” on the part of otherwise decent Americans.Unz about a month ago had a good write up on ChatGPT. Seems you can buy/subscribe/license and get the ability to use their (Alphabet) software to create your own “chatbots”. Well, Unz got right to it (damn it’s good to be rich). He has every article by himself and numerous other authors for over a decade. Literally millions of words. He created a “personal” ChatGPT using all of his articles from himself as input data. He also used other authors articles and created any number of ChatGPT’s using his site’s data for them.He then asked Google’s public ChatGPT a question and then his own. Say the question, “Who killed JFK?” Needless to say, he received two different responses. Neither needs to be deemed correct, but rather one should note that they often give a different answer from one another—and to sometimes a disturbing degree. Especially to one that has researched the topic at hand and has knowledge outside of an AI oracle.The old computer science/statistics term for this phenomenon is “garbage in, garbage out”. Heretofore, you’d “Google” this question and with luck stumble upon an article or two that gives a dissident view of the answer. Now, you no longer need to read several discourses and put together a narrative for yourself using your thinking skill, ChatGPT summarizes all for you. No need to bother yourself with reading several sources, and thinking, and analysis. The “party line” is there for you to regurgitate—just type it into Alphabet’s ChatGPT AI. Viola! Instant genius.That is the brave new world being offered. As Wikipedia was shown to have human bias and therefore lacked credibility on contentious issues of the day, so too will ChatGPT’s and other forms of AI. Of that I’m certain.

                I’m not as optimistic. I agree with the entire leadup, but I think you underestimate confirmation bias. Wiki has not been discredited generally on contentious issues. People still cite Wiki as authoritative in Climate Science or Gender Science or Vaccine Science. People cling to the sources that tell them what they want to think. That’s why FOX and MSNBC have their true believers. VOX and HuffPo, anyone?
Though I admit I was pleasantly surprised to hear Colbert’s audience take the off-hand comment about CNN’s objectivity as a laugh line.

                    I must disagree with you on Wiki.  Take just Climate science.  The Wiki editors were accused going on 15-20 years or so to have gotten together to delete, change, or freeze any article additions/corrections that went against the prevailing theory of anthropomorphic CO2 being the cause of CC and to delete/reject any article questioning such modeling and models in general.  It was a scandal at that time of wide notoriety.  I admit to not having used Wiki for anything much in the last 15-20 years or so, but I’m not going to argue Wiki matters at this point.  They are dead to me.In defense—sort of—bias was also shown as well in the peer reviewed journals of the time. See “Climategate.” It occurred in November 2009 when thousands of emails and documents from the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit (CRU) were hacked and published online. I read these e-mails myself extensively.  Perhaps my first foray into “dissident thinking”.  I was shocked to say the least—but not wrt the aspect of incorrect thinking on CC change, but to my naivety wrt human foibles of so called “scientists”.  My “god” had been killed.You don’t remove bias simply by having more numbers of biased moderators control your product.  That was the biggest flaw in Wiki’s conception—that it would all come out in the wash.  That editors would be basically unbiased in their decisions and for those few instances of “a bad call”, someone would rise to correct such an issue.I was once banned myself and the article I published (not relating to CC) was taken down, or however they term it.  This by an anonymous “editor” with no direct knowledge regarding the article’s content.  Since the reputation of Wiki in my mind was pretty low, and my published article was not of great importance, more like a test of the concept and use of the site, I let the matter drop and moved on with my life.There is a reason Wikipedia is not allowed to be cited in any college term paper—at least until I left the university.  Wiki is not an authoritative source, but rather a consensus of opinion of people who in themselves are not usually authoritative, but nonetheless have the power of an editor on the site.  People who cite Wiki are simply not in the know about what an authoritative citation implies.

                        Sorry for the misunderstanding. Not what I meant. Wiki is crap. (To an arguably lesser extent, so is Infogalactic.) I just meant that NPCs believe it to be authoritative, and they are generally the ones who get to decide what is mis- and disinformation.
I once got into a discussion with some environists about containment systems, and I pointed out they didn’t appreciate the effects of montmorillonite in these systems. But because Wiki disagreed, I was “lying” or at best “misleading”.

                            Thanks for the reply Steve.  I was confused by your response and had to do a little soul searching into myself.  We seem on the same wavelength at this point.
BTW:  For those here reading, note my comment to Jack above.  Nothing I say is gospel. Read, think, and correct—we’ll both be the better for it.

        Well, the surface explanation seems to point to technological ease of life as the cause for increasing the observable indolence and apathy that is inflicting our population… I think the real cause is a lot more complicated than that though.It seems that a lot of that apathy is simply caused by more and more people realizing,either consciously or unconsciously, that really, we are pretty screwed. We are a dying empire ruled by bad people.A dying empire with a propaganda apparatus of a scale and scope never before seen in all of human history.The sensible thing for our ruling class to do at this point would be to try and roll back then reverse some of the selfish excesses and failed social engineering projects that have led our society to this point.. But that seems very unlikely to happen, and even if they wanted to try they probably would not be able to undo most of the damage.People with above room temperature IQ realize that the news is fake, it’s now common knowledge. The majority don’t pay very much attention to it anymore, outside of large events like covid. Coincidentally, covid probably increased the number of people who are unhappy with our ruling caste by a large percentage. But it’s mostly that the more general decrease in quality of life, society and culture have led to an increase of that, difficult to describe but never too far from the surface, feeling of unease that seems to now permeate the collective unconsciousness of society. Everyone expects things to get worse, it’s grassroots common knowledge.More people are medicating themselves than ever before (SSRIs for example, are similar to a chemical lobotomy and over 43 million people in the USA are taking them. A good way to think of them is as analogous to the “Soma” drug in BNW, they do the same thing though less effectively than the fictional drug, no more bad moods or anxiety about the world).And people are right to be worried… More people than ever are living paycheck to paycheck indebted lives and the majority will never own a home, there is less cultural cohesion than ever before in our nation’s history and what little “popular” culture there is is weird and has strong anti-White, anti-Christian and anti-traditional undertones…This country will not last the way things are going and everyone outside of our ruling caste has realized on some level that they have very, very little say in how things are run. The future looks bad and a diplomatic solution does not seem likely. This does bode well for anyone.People would naturally prefer not to dwell on it, and it makes a lot of sense that many would seek some method of diverting themselves from thinking about it too much… but.. that doesn’t mean that people don’t realize it. There just doesn’t seem to be much they can do about it at the moment and most prefer not to dwell on things they feel they cannot change.. but at the same time… it’s becoming increasingly difficult for people to ignore so… things are getting more and more unstable as the masses begin to flail out in desperate ways.

        I don’t know, we have a much better word than Prolificity we can use to describe this and that’s duplicity.  This is especially true with the minor celebrities we call “influencers”  These artificial “manufactured profiles” are not the influencer or even politician merely playing a role.  I don’t even see ‘playing a role’ as being all that bad and is often aspirational.  What they are doing is a deliberate attempt to deceive you, usually for monetary gain or just “likes.”  They are the same people who in an earlier age would have been working as a con artist.

            The mass media served its purpose as a homogeneous one size fits all way of doing things, but a lot of people have niche interests. I have a niche hobby that also happens to overlap with what I do for a living. To be honest, I was a little ashamed of my hobby as a kid because it’s kind of weird. The internet gave people who shared the same interests an outlet and a way to connect with other people with the same kinds of obscure interests. (Once you realize there are others out there, you don’t feel so weird anymore.)I started and run a Facebook group catering to people who also have the same hobby. As of today, I’ve got 25,500 members and it keeps growing. I’m not sure what it means because I question whether people are actually engaged or whether they just join and scan what comes in their feed, but it’s still something more impressive than having 300 members. (I get nothing out of it, but I consider it time spent on market research for my day job.)My point is that with so many outlets for what you’re really interested in, how can homogeneous one size fits all media break through anymore?

                    No, but my point is, that everything has become atomized these days. There is no critical mass that you can rally the public around with anymore. These people like Cernovich and Fuentes, that’s their niche, that’s what people are into. They strike a chord in their followers.
Just a little aside: Zelensky’s name is probably derived from the word for the color green (zelen, zeleno). Cernovich’s name is probably derived from the word for the color black (cern, cerno).

                        Sure…. But there’s a difference between a cult of personality and a “community,”  even an “internet community” (for all that’s worth).In a regular community, there will naturally be leaders or at least the most popular or the most knowledgeable about the said hobby. But, the community is built around the hobby, not around the person.Cerno and Fuentes are cults of personality who only exist because of the cult leader.  The cult leader is what holds them together.  If the most knowledgeable guy in your weird hobby happens to die, your weird hobby doesn’t go away.  You just find a new most knowledgeable guy to count on when you need help or advice about your hobby.  If Nick were to get aids and die, the Groypers will no longer exist.  They will find other leaders and most likely, they will find multiple leaders that will split into “factions” who will no longer interact.

        Trump’s collapse in the polls is largely because of his team’s failures to recognize how fake the entire national discourse it. He gave a press conference on inflation yesterday. Despite the fact that inflation actually IS a huge problem, and actually HAS made everything more expensive, and IS a result of horrible government policies, it’s not going to make a single person vote one way or the other. People are going to vote for Kamala because she is “brat” or because JD Vance is “weird” though.This is something that Trump intuitively grasped in 2016, yet for some reason he has let GOP losers tell him that messages from losing GOP campaigns is the path to victory.

            I disagree. For starters, the polling is all garbage at this point. This is true in every election. Even if the polling companies tried to do good polling, the results would be trash because the sample would eb trash. People are not tuned into this stuff right now.
More important, in every election the top item has been the economy, followed closely by quality of life issue4s, which usually mean crime, but will include immigration now. Those will determine how much rigging must be done to get Harris a win.

                Yeah, the illusion of a close election is necessary for a cheat even to be halfway plausible. There is a magic number required before the fraud is not obvious from outer space, though, whatever that number may be. The only interesting part about the election and the unsaid part is what will happen if the margin of fraud is not obtained and the cheating cannot be denied. It is tempting to say “nothing” but I wouldn’t bet that way.

                    The cheating was pretty open in 2020 and 2022, and nothing happened except that some people who pointed it out too aggressively got mauled by the system.  I see no reason to believe there is any amount of fraud, or even tyranny for that matter, that will induce a real rebellion.  Maaaaybe a military draft?   Or confiscation of 401k accounts?I think most of us are painfully aware how alone we are and how easy it would be to pick us off one by one.  Right wing people almost always have a lot to lose, and are not insane enough to ignore the risks.    The system is great at destroying anybody who starts to show real leadership potential for our side, and appears to have an abundance of infiltrators willing to waste their time keeping an eye on us.  On top of that, the ugly  stuff that would have to be done are beyond what most rightward people are willing to consider.

                        Agreed with all of that, but there will be a last time and suspect that would be it. The Left almost always curls up into a fetal position and moans and surrenders when hit hard, but usually that punch comes too late to be decisive. Open, indisputable election fraud is a good candidate for being the last time given what has transpired with the attempted murder and lawfare. The irony is the election results themselves do not matter. In ’20 and ’22 there was at least plausible deniability, though even then the outcome was irrelevant as far as the trajectory.Again, if this happens this time it likely will be freelance, emergent behavior and I easily can see answered violence, likely too late but that’s not for certain.

                    “…if the margin of fraud is not obtained and the cheating cannot be denied.”I can only make statements based on experience here in AZ, but it seems to me the cheating will always be denied, because the courts *never* allow otherwise.  All cases here have been tossed or the standard of evidence placed so high, they are not brought to trial.  This “failure to find guilt of fraud” is assumed to be evidence of “non-guilt”, hence my doubts.None of the above convinces those who follow these things in a thoughtful manner, but they do provide a legal cover for the process of fraud.  This is the reason I don’t dwell on this in argument.  It’s a rabbit hole we get lost in.  Better to describe to potential pathways a fraud can occur and ask why they are allowed to remain unclosed.There is one change in AZ election law that has crept in despite their protests.  The filled out ballots delivered to a polling place, rather than mailed in, must be counted before those ballots are shipped off to the main counting centers.  Heretofore they were an unknown number and ripe for “stuffing”.  Officially, our chief elections person (Dem) has said it’s too much work and won’t do it.  😉

                        Wild. I’m suggesting possible extrajudicial reaction, of course, but what you describe is, again, wild about the Arizona courts. Did the McCain machine, which I assume was quite real, cement that corrupt system into place? I suspect a growing number realize the judiciary is just as fake and gay and fraudulent, even with the mind-blowing stupidity/ineptitude aside, as everything else, but it still would make total sense that the last venue with limited hypothetical credibility would become the last resort.

                            I believe two explanations may be in order.  1) there is judicial bias, 2) (the one I believe) is that the courts do not wish to directly interject in political affairs as a survival mechanism.
Of the three branches of government, the judicial is the weakest—and they know it.  To interfere blatantly into the other two is to invite the same to them.

                                Thanks. It would seem there would have to be statutory authority and case law as to what the burden of proof is–I actually can see why it would be required to be higher than a mere preponderance–but if everything always goes in one direction, either (a) no case ever meets the threshold of proof or (b) sufficient evidence is disregarded. Courts seem so highly politicized at this point it makes me assume the latter has to happen from time to time. Again, thanks.

                I don’t agree that the top item is the economy anymore. Maybe it was when this was a nation, but in a multicultural democracy, it has turned into a racial headcount + culture war. I used to live in a city that did well during the Trump years and is now getting its ass kicked by crime and migrant gibs and the urban poor got squeezed hard by inflation. They’re still going to go 80%+ for Kamala.Owing to the point in your post, people live their lives on social media, on shitlib Twitter, they talk about Trump like he is in the room with them, haunting them. The Handmaid’s Tale fantasies they concocted about Project 2025 was especially illustrative of this, it is like they weren’t around to see this guy actually govern for four years. Because, in a way, they were not, they were on social media.

            There’s this myth that Trump ran a great campaign in 2016. If so, it didn’t materialize at the ballot box, where he came in just shy of 46% of the popular vote. Percentage wise, that’s less than Romney. He benefited from running against the most unlikeable presidential candidate in modern history, certainly in living memory, who was never, ever going to top 50% because too many people had made up their minds about her years before and weren’t going to change them. A great many people voted for him merely to vote against her. This (along with regime overconfidence) opened the door to a narrow EC victory.After witnessing 2020 and now 2024, we can put to rest this notion that he is, or ever was, a great campaigner. He does enjoy the adulation he gets at the rallies. I think that’s why he keeps doing them. While I give a nod to the energy that was required for the pace of them (which is waning, he is doing fewer rallies now than he did in 2020 or 2016).

                        The problem though, is that Cackula has thoroughly alienated the diversity. Blacks are watching their gibs re-channeled to migrants and they are hopping mad about it, as are the seniors and pensioners. They are starting to pay attention now that their fat is in the fire.
The left are masters at dividing people and driving wedges between them… I wonder if they’ve reached a critical limit where they are now so divided, they can’t work with each other anymore….

                “He benefited from running against the most unlikeable presidential candidate in modern history,”
At best the second most unlikable candidate—Trump himself was the *most* unlikable candidate in history.  A problem that he still has to this very day!  This is why a demented cabbage beat him in 2020 and the most mediocre AA politician on record is giving him a good race.
Look, you like Trump (maybe), I like Trump (definitely), but that does not change his dislike numbers.  His fans are wildly enthusiastic, his detractors wildly rabid.  Hence he is the most polarizing figure in political memory.

        people are now going back into Plato’s cavemy personal antidote to this is prayer, reading old books, and daily ealks in the woods. Although  I’m probably not always successful in escaping all the brainwashing.but seriously, I think newspapers could have done the created the same “character” thing in the past 300 years. And minstrel shows and the like. I don’t think it’s totally unique to the internet. In a way, the radio could have done it, too. In fact it’s very possible that it was easier to create fake characters based on real people with the radio as there was not much other competition to that early imagination tingling device!

            “In a way, the radio could have done it, too.”
Not really, because of how radio was structured. The on-air talent were local, members of the community. There wasn’t massive syndication until much later. The first practical syndication was a result of Bing Crosby’s funding of Ampex, which developed commercial mag tape recording in the late ’40s. Sure, 78s served the same purpose, but could not be one-to-many reproduced.

                Mass syndication was there almost with the birth of radio. The first TV networks came from the radio networks, as did the studios system that produced both. There were broadcast networks, even if DJs were local.

                    Not really, or there would never have been the long-obsolete mandate for most stations to go low power after sunset. The ostensible reason was so that the 50kW blowers like WLS, KOMA, WABC, WCCO (then WLAG) etc. could cover the entire fruited plain. They were at best loosely affiliated, generally to carry sports events.
Of course, the fact that never once were the blowers used that way makes a pretty good argument it was just more cronyism.

In other words, before sunset, syndication did exist and of programs that are comparable to modern TV.
I’m good at being annoying here, but the War of the Worlds radio hoax from 1938 could have not caused a widespread panic without a form syndication. I believe that the saying was that the smart people were listening to the dummy, aka the Charlie McCarthy show at the same time slot.
Radio developed the national ecosystem that would lend itself directly to radio with pictures, aka TV.

Been a long time since I got my license, but seems to me there were only a couple dozen stations included in what you are calling “syndication”.

                    That line was genius propaganda, pretending that the bro-science position was “It’s just a flu, bro” when the knowledgeable non-expert’s point was “It’s just acold“—which itwas, and that’s of greatepidemiologicalsignificance.
The flu is serious and murderous. A cold is “common” and incurable. Mostly harmless. Any serum concocted to prevent it is doing something else entirely. Etc.
The lie was so good, the bros pretended along.
(If Sailer’s on the payroll, pushing the “flu” strawman was how he got his first paycheck. I think he does it for free. Or, he did. He’s monetized his hobby now.)

Yes. This helps. Shut off the Net as necessary, exercise, read, and pray.
I also agree that this is nothing new. We’re just dealing with it at the speed of the Internet.

        As it turns out Kamala did in fact speak of practical matters. She shared her economic proposals in front of a paltry audience. She went off about “price gouging” at grocery stores and proposed price controls among other things. Even the WaPo panned it as Nixonian and an inevitable failure. The NY Post came up with the meme Kamunism which I suppose is spreading around.

            Yeah, but the difference between candidates is pretty much one of *degree* wrt pandering.  Trump’s promise of tax free SSI and tax free tips is also simple pandering with the essential result of giving one group money out of the other’s pocket.
Now a real statesman would run on a balanced budget proposal, rather than pick the interest groups with the most votes to bribe.  Of course, I admit that all such candidates til now that have promoted such have fallen by the wayside.

They also lie?It would certainly be ironic if this was some sort of feigned naivete.I don’t follow Keith Woods at all, but am I to assume you’d take him more seriously if he had a doctorate in virology before he started telling you Corona was a zombie apocalypse?I thought you were supposed to be against credentialism or “expertocracy”.

            I don’t think that was the point.
The paper linked to is heavy on jargon and light in substance, sure, but I thought the key takeaway is that in the new paradigm, you are who you identify as today. If you are still perceiving things through other mental frameworks, like sincerity or authenticity, you will miss the point.
Our side has a huge blind spot there. The man playacting a woman to be able to kick the crap out of her at the Olympics is just that. An act. And, yet, we assume it must be much more.

                        I don’t believe it’s that bad. Of course, I long ago moved to a rural area far more to my liking, but I doubt 1/4 of Zoomers are really faggots. I think it’s probably like the Olympics or that guy who smoked women in collegiate swimming. It’s just a way to distinguish yourself from the crowd, and, since tranny is the latest thing, it’s something you can pretend to be to get on the good side of HR or college admissions or whomever.

                                Maybe. The point is to get past the DIE screeners. Anyone who does not at least play-act the part is going to have to remain living in Dad &amp; Mom’s basement.

            The point is that authenticity is being ditched in favor of raw emotions, fantasy, and imagery. Credentialism may or may not be part of authenticity, but that’s not even a side issue in this. A more legitimate criticism is this is not really new.

            My thought too, it’s just persona. Everyone has one and politicians etc. hone theirs to the max to deceive. Jung didn’t think it was all bad if one chose correctly and became the mask.

            The term “expert” has morphed from experience and expertise in a field to a kind of fake credential.  They took the term and wore it like a skinsuit in the same way the Nobel Prize thing has turned into a political propaganda organ.  From what I’ve seen, it’s used as a replacement of a credential.  Like how all the sudden a bunch of 24 year olds became “experts” in “misinformation” and “disinformation.”This, I think, is what Z-man means when he talks about men with “practical knowledge” vs all the flunkies who never had a real job in their life but are nevertheless taken seriously in clownworld.The real world has millions of experts in various fields who we rely on daily for virtually everything.
