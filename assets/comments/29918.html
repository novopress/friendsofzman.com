        Z, if: ‘Musk is the world’s richest man’ and then you state: ‘The nine other men in the top-10 richest list are worth five times Musk combined,’ how is Musk the richest if the others are ‘worth five times Musk combined?’ Thank you for the clarification.

            if you add up the wealth of two through ten, it is five times that of Musk. The point is that it only takes a few other oligarchs to counter Musk, despite him being the top oligarch.

        Game Over. man!
At this point, future generations will condemn veterans who fought against Nazi GermanyAfter all, it wasn’t Nazi wants to steal their land and women, it was Jews and blacksAll those innocent German soldiers who butchered by white American soldiers because they don’t want their homeland taken over by Jew

        I’m reading these comments about demographics, and I’m tired, so I’ll cut to the chase.Whites have always been a minority globally, yet came to dominate. Quality vs. quantity.How did we ever get into playing the numbers game? Why would we ever buy into strict majority rule when we’ve never been in the majority in relation to the rest of the world? And have we so lost confidence in ourselves to not trust our innate quality, which has always served us well? Are there notions of magic dirt and magic ideas because we’ve gotten so down on ourselves? Seems obvious as I type that, but it’s another thing I have to keep reminding myself of.

        i assume you’ve heard of the actor Richard Dreyfuss. His civil/calm way of describing things sounds almost like a politician from 50 years ago. Compare that to the nastiness/cattiness of someone like Kurt Schlichter on the right and a lot of the lefties on twitter:

            It doesn’t really matter what old geezers like him think. He’s 75, maybe he has another decade or so left with us. He will be dismissed, rightly or wrongly, as the boomer that he is. The (very near) future belongs to the millenials and gen z. And the immigrants they welcome with open arms. God help us
But he sure is showing up a lot lately. As if somebody wants us to hear him

            Dreyfuss was been one of the most obnoxious and outspoken Hollywood leftists of all time. So now he is unhappy with the results of the policies he’s been screaming for his entire adult life? Cry me a river.

                i don’t think he was ever very outspoken one way or another. To the extent he is now, he doesn’t come across as a strident conservative.

        The Tsar was overthrown because tribal banks funded the tribal revolutionaries and other countries, such as Germany, actively helped the revolutionaries.No such help exists in the modern world for dissidents. We are on our own and that likely won’t end well for us just like it isn’t ending well for the Charlottesville crowd or the Jan 6th protesters. And just like it didn’t for the folks in WACO or Ruby Ridge.The system will mutate and change as the population and leadership changes and as the dollar loses its grip. However, the younger the person, the more likely to be woke and a single female (the craziest and most easily manipulated of all).The system has a lot of life still in it.

        There’s an intersting op-ed piece at Russia Today: Musk recently compared George Soros to Marvel Universe rogue Magneto. I’m much better acquanted with fictional Magneto (this from several of the Marvel movies); probably I only know a fraction of his “biography.” Mercurial character though he may be, to the best of my knowledge, he fights for his people (mutants) but did not actively seek to the destruction of normal humans in the bargain. I doubt  the same can be said for Mr. Soros.The awesome power that ultra rich individuals and corporations have in world affairs must not be underestimated.In other news apparently Kiev had a bit of trouble with their new toy, the Patriot missile battery.

            Magneto changes with his writers. When I was a kid he once either saw or traveled to the future. I remember how the panels looked but not how they happened. What he saw happening to the mutants there, and to America, a techno-dystopia with no dream left but mutant suppression forever, switched him from “never again” to “we have to do it to them before they do it to us.” That era of the X-Men was, as it couldn’t be now—as it can’t now be acknowledged ever to have been—a critique of the ethno-paranoiac fantasies that inspired, e.g., “The Authoritarian Personality” and “The Plot against America.”And Soros, supposedly. But I’ve seen no evidence he’s as complexly motivated as any comic-book villain. He’s just “Hulk smash.”

        I like to think Tsarism could’ve been saved if Nikolai hadn’t abdicated, and the White Army won the civil war. The Tsarists should’ve purged the reformers from their ranks, and clamped down on the radicals with an iron fist. Hopefully, if the current ruling class makes the same mistake with Elon Musk, it will result in their deposition too.

        The problem Musk has with twatter and for that matter the entire federal governmental system is they are both hopelessly unreformable.  It all just needs to be burned to the ground and rebuilt from scratch.  There will also be a lot fewer folks around rebuilding the new system than are currently around F-ing up the current system – most of whom are long past their “should have been dealt with by” dates…

        There’s no reason to believe the system will be overthrown.Certainly there’s no one and no movement in their way.The idea that it will happen is a nice cope, a romantic trope  bearing no scrutiny when you look at the history.Louis XVI fell because he blinked at his own ambitious aristocratic rivals who did you know make up the Third Estate.  The Duc of Orleans fermented revolution to take the throne.Nicholas fell on his sword in 1914 to save France, who repaid him in 1917 by inciting a coup by the Kadets and Russian military, the Bolsheviks are a footnote without Ludendorff.None of these conditions exist in America.   Nor does any actual opposition, dissidents are wankers allowed to talk  just as Antifa and the noggers are allowed to riot.Bringing us to Musk;  he and his fellow oligarchs who’ve had enough are all there is besides the talking and appropriately named Gab.   It’s unwise to turn up one’s nose at them…

            With such bold decisive men as you atop the barricades, it’s a wonder the whole thing hasn’t been overthrown already.
Maybe if we had enough men of inaction inspiring cadres of sadsack defeatists with constant demoralization the thing could be turned around.

            May not be overthrown.  Collapse is inevitable.  Result is the same (though overthrowing allows for more control over the aftermath).

        We have the exact OPPOSITE of the French and Russian Revolutions. In both the prior cases, the regime composed of ever more less able aristocrats were unable to quell the rising tide of peasants wanting more and crucially, the middling classes wanting to climb into the aristocracy and being denied.Here, we have an ever expanding, more diverse by the second, less able aristocracy disguised as a managerial elite, trying to TAKE AWAY what the peasants (working class) and middling classes ALREADY HAVE. The pressure and desire for revolt ENTIRELY comes from the Elites determined to make their inferiors ever more poor and ever more micromanaged by the Elites. For sadistic reasons, ethnic/racial grievances, and the like. They can’t enjoy their victory and leave things along, they must be on a holy crusade to crush the Dirts as “White Supremacists” (defined as anyone even non-Whites opposed to their agenda) and an oft-stated desire for blood. Like Shrillary, Liawatha, Susan Rice, Samantha Power etc. the most bloodthirsty are the power skirts girl bosses.Absent their desire to make everyone beneath them Renfield to their Dracula and eat bugs (humiliation is a big part of their desire, from sterilizing Dirt kids via “transgender” to eat the bugz!) there would be no revolt at all.Hence the Biden Regime simply transferring and punishing the IRS Whistleblowers investigating Son of Big Guy, instead of appointing a White-washing Special Prosecutor guaranteed to drag things out and issue wrist slaps. At the end of History, they must have this fight. Emotionally they need it like a junkie needs his fix.

                The “migrants” flooding into “our” country right now are being brought here to disarm the American population. They are soldiers, not immigrants or even illegal aliens, although they are that in a strict sense.All these military-aged young men with telephones (the portable, individual command and control structure) are soldiers.We saw quite clearly in January 2021 that “the most popular president ever” had to be inaugurated behind barbed wire and 25,000 armed men.But we know also that on “January 6th,” Nancy Pee was on the phone to the Pentagon several times demanding (but never getting) regular troops b/c she didn’t think the Guardsmen at her disposal could be counted on to obey her orders.I have numerous times done the simple arithmetic–as other readers of this blog also have done–showing that the numbers simply were not there for FedGov or for any other government(s) at any level to suppress the population if the population did not wish to be suppressed. They simply did not have the manpower.But now they do, or they very soon will.That manpower is being brought into the country right now. The notion (I can’t call it an idea) that they are being brought in to vote Democrat is silly. They are being stationed here to go door to door to disarm the American population.To do that, they will not give anybody an appointment. They will simply go through neighborhoods during the day when nobody is at home, and they will gain entry and seize anything they want. The opportunity to shoot it out with them will never even arise. In those instances where it does, they will “Waco” the place.Once the digital “currency” has been forced upon us, they will ration gasoline and food, likely in that order. And when they judge the right time to have come, the disarming will be launched and will succeed, by and large.

                    Since the invasion started, the long-term plan has been to enlist brown and black soldiers who will fire on whites.  No more, no less.  And if the crony capitalists get lower wages in the meantime, all the better.

                        You are most likely right. I don’t know about “all along,” but it is glaringly obvious what is going on now.
But now they also have as many as 10,000 Chinese soldiers (according to the Border Patrol) and thousands of Afghans and Pakistanis.

                        As if they would have a problem getting whites to fire on whites. I encourage anyone to look for historical examples where  soldiers refused orders. Few and far between. Look at what was done to civilians in the south in the Civil War. Missouri especially I bring to your attention. All those people were white.

                    use of CBDC will be to dispossess whites and redistribute their liquid assets to non-whites. Obviously some white-presenting groups will be exempt.I will have to mull over the suggested use of the invaders to disarm the populace. While it is certainly something this gangster regime would do, there are many flaws with it. Has there been an upsurge in military training in, say, Honduras? Because this plan would require enormous discipline on the part of the foot soldiers to pull off without sparking a Waco an hour. Another problem is population dispersal. The gibs are in the metropolises and the draw for illegals will be to them. And so on.Something huge is indeed underway, and that is outside of the invasion, which in and of itself is enormous. It is hard to get a feel just yet for what is planned, but we know the following:1. Large numbers of unknown people have entered the country;2. The propaganda organs are being cleansed of even potential dissident voices; and3. There is a laser focus on civilian firearm ownership complete with false flag operations.These people are evil, but they also fail routinely, are quite insane, and are impulsive and reckless. I suspect they will have a domestic Afghanistan on their hands if what you suggested is planned, and, again, it might be what they do have in mind despite all the readily apparent problems.

            “We have the exact OPPOSITE of the French and Russian Revolutions. In both the prior cases, the regime composed of ever more less able aristocrats were unable to quell the rising tide of peasants wanting more and crucially, the middling classes wanting to climb into the aristocracy and being denied.”Good post overall, but may I reply briefly to the statement above?It is axiomatic that “the winners write the history” and, although the Spanish Civil War (1936 – 1939) is a noteworthy exception, it is true of the 1789 – 1799 “French Revolution.”But it is just not true that there was a “rising tide of peasants” demanding this and that. That is the “official” history; the history accepted and “known” by most people.The true origins of the 1789 revolution have been well documented in at least two books that I know of: one by Fénelon Gibon, published in 1919 under the title “Petite histoire de la révolution française” and subtitled“Histoire d’une conspiration contre le peuple” (“History of a Conspiracy Against the People”) and available only in French; and the other, “Organizing the Revolution” by Augustin Cochin now available in an English translation by Nancy Derr Polin, with a preface by Claude Polin.Gibon’s 1919 work was reissued in 2022 by La France pittoresque(ISBN 978-2-36722-038-3) and is available in paperback athttp://www.france-pittoresque.combut only in French.Nancy Polin’s English translation of Cochin’s work is available here in English:https://www.amazon.com/Organizing-Revolution-Selections-Augustin-Cochin/dp/0972061673/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8To be *very* brief, the 1789 revolution was the work of many years’ organizing and planning by Freemasons and by the so-called “philosophes,” comprising Rousseau, Voltaire, Diderot, Montesquieu, and others. It was *not* a popular uprising any more than was the Bolshevik revolution in Russia or the actions of the Khmer Rouge. It *was* a conspiracy against the French people in particular and against Christian civilization in general.

Sadly, this is true.  And yes, it is a very long and complex supra-history.
The masons ran the U.S. revolution also, and currently stage-manage the Great Reset.  They supervised the Sixties cultural revolution, etc.
The various masonic lodges and allied occult entities are not the ultimate authority for decision-making.  That is made at the level above them.Always with the revolutions, eh?  It happens when Lucy Fer is your boss.

                Huh.The Founders were Masons;DC’s architecture is of Masonic design and laid out in a cartwheel by a French road architect;France “owned” the center of the continent from the Yukon to New Orleans;The French Navy saved the American Revolution, that war effort bankrupted the Bourbons;Franklin and Jefferson both spent a lot of time visiting France before the French Revolution;America was a successful attempt to reorder society;The Masonic idea itself was a reordering of religion and a synthesis of knowledge bases, in response to the 30 Years religious war of Catholic branches;Most American secret societies are Masonic, most American religious societies are Escatological (End Times);The Mason creed itself is “civilization will fall  be prepared to Build Back Better” [Solomon the Architect is their sigil]).A Masonic Empire. The Judaic version in the Orthodox sphere was its counterpoint.  It rhymes with the period of Arianite Goths and Athanasian Romans in North Africa and Ravenna.

            Upward mobility isn’t normal. The rich normally have huge families and the poor can’t feed them, so don’t breed them. The French Revolution was probably caused by drugs, especially opium, and the vices that come with them, that devastated the aristocracy but left the middle class untouched. By the 19th century, China was dominated by drugs and similarly went through similar rebellions and revolutions.
Modern decadence is more comparable to a court eunuch coup from the bronze age. Complete with “sea peoples” migrations.

            I still think the closest anaglogue we have in the [former] U.S. today, is Spain in the 1920s and 1930s, in that country’s run-up to their own civil war: republicans/nationalists vs. socialists.
It’s the closest 20th century item I can think of.
But am happy to be proven wrong (with facts and evidence, of course…).

        One quibble with “there was no saving Tsar Nicholas II and the system that made him possible”:There was a solution, of the final variety if you will.  No man no problem, no nose no revolutionary.  The problem was that failure of asabiyyah causing the nation to lose its will to do what needed to be done.  Hence the liberal attempts to placate the revolutionaries instead of crushing them.We’ve got the same crap now with the race baiters.  Our nation has given in to the framing that all of our heroes were actually villains so blacks can now parade around claiming we owe them $5 million each.  And some prick like Gavin Newsom will placate them with a smaller amount as a “liberal reform” making both sides angrier and having the same result as Mirsky.

        Semi-OT, but one thing that gets me about that era, is that the Germans had the opportunity to march on Paris early in the war but didn’t, for whatever reason.It would’ve been an awful spectacle, but imagine how different the world would be today: the war would’ve been shortened considerably; Europe wouldn’t have sacrificed its manhood; America would probably still be isolationist; the ‘British’ Empire wouldn’t stagger on as zombie GAE; Germany doesn’t desperately stoke Irish nationalists and ship Bolsheviks into Russia; the USSR might never have happened and Russia might still be tsarist; National Socialism probably never happens; the German Empire is probably the undisputed alpha dog of Europe; etc.Crazy to think about.

            The Belgians [of all people, who’da thunk it?] threw together an improvised resistance of ferocious intensity, which took the Kaiser by complete surprise, and gave England &amp; France just enough time to position the forces necessary for staging a proper bloodbath.Wilhelm was expecting to waltz through the tulips of Belgium in what would subsequently be Der Fuhrer’s Blitzkrieg style, but Wilhelm badly misunderestimated the tenacity of the Belgians.In the immortal words of Mike Tyson, every fighter has the perfect game plan, right up until he gets punched in the nose.===============The larger and vastly more existential problem for the likes of Wilhelm II &amp; Nicholas II was that they failed to properly &amp; correctly &amp; incontrovertibly identify the ackshual enemy whom they faced, which, of course, was the House of Rothschild.Lashing out at all the wrong enemies in the room, but failing to notice the 800 lb gorilla of an existential enemy sitting silently over in the far shadows of the room, is the perfect recipe for extinction.

            Not to blame the Germans for everything, either. It amazes me, though, how something so seemingly accidental could be so potentially important. Europe might’ve sleepwalked into the war, but at that point they were wide awake, and a quick German victory might’ve been the only thing to keep the world from sliding into the abyss.

        this is off topic but does anyone think it would be a smart idea for some businessman to build headquarters of a corporation in somewhere like nebraska? Steve Sailer has said somewhere that places like that have the highest numbers of people with high ACT/SAT but overlooked by prestigious schools in the country.So you wouldn’t have to pay them as much and the taxes in a place like that aren’t as high either. Lastly, because of the demographics of the area – you wouldn’t have to deal with ESG type quotas because the demographics of the area could be your alibi.A few years ago i didn’t think this – but I’d rather have Tom Dick Harry who might not have as much education to Ashish Akabuderbong with three or four degrees from prestigious schools. I feel the former would be more likely to not be arrogant or have an attitude problem.

                Yep, the ability to run and hide from the brown tide are fading.Even states like Minnesota and Oregon are increasingly non-white, with MN white births being 68% and Oregon 65%. Imagine what another 20 years of immigration and differing birthrates will do to those states.This is why I laugh at all the “stolen election” talk. Who cares. The demographics will make it so the Dems never need to cheat. Here are the white births as a % of births for a couple of key states that the GOP has to win:Arizona – 40%Georgia – 43%North Carolina – 53%Btw, Texas is 33% while Florida is 42%.Yes, yes, babies don’t vote. But you see the trend. Couple that with immigration, and it’s over for the GOP, not that they matter, but GrillerCons will notice at some point that they will never again have a president from their party in the White House. The House will also be permanently blue.That’s when things get interesting. I’d suspect that GAE will go nuts for awhile before burning out into Brazil of the North.

                    And those are just births to white women. With 15-20% popping out Hispanic / Black babies, the real numbers are even more dire.
One of the few good things about Canada – we are remarkably still 66.8% white/native for age 0-5, so roughly 61% white. And only kids with 2 white parents are counted as white.
I suspect that fertility rate of whites (who produce other whites) in the US is lower than every other western country, simply due to losing 20% to mixed race couples.

                        Agreed. But I’ll give credit to Canadian whites, you guys were late to the suicide party, but you have made up a lot of ground in a short time.
And your politicians seems to revel in openly calling for millions of immigrants a year. Granted, you’re not importing Hispanics, but Indians and Chinese might be even more annoying. At least, Hispanics generally stay in their own neighborhoods.

                Even if this is true, this is the kind of positive thinking and the type of action we have to take. The demographic situation will be worse in 20 years. That is a certainty. Do you want to do things like what krustykurmudgeon suggests and be in a much stronger position to deal with it in 20 years, or to just give up and be in the worst possible position to deal with it in 20 years?This is good thinking KrustyK. It makes sense not just for possible attitude, but for helping our people and giving them the ability to grow and get experience in leadership and management. Tech senior leadership seems dominated by imported people. We see they could care less about our values and our people.Go for it! It isn’t just youngsters you will attract and hire, but experienced people who are sick and tired of woke corps.

                    Whites will need to learn to form their own communities (business, schools, community centers, churches, banks, etc.) regardless of what state that they live in.
Otherwise, we will truly become helots. And, yes, there is much that can be done now to move toward that future. Other whites will come later.

                    Reality is kinda right, but there is still an error in the thinking.  Moving to a low-population northern clime that is 60%+ White is a fools errand. They are targeting those places specifically for demographic takeover: ie Bozeman MT.  If a city only has 50,000 people in a state under 1m pop, they only need a couple dozen thousand immivaders to take over; if there is a sizeable lefty contingent (OR, MN), it will fall quickly.  Where do you think those 5-7 million Nuevo Americans who Came Over this year are going to end up?  Less than 1/2 will be in metropolises and mestizo-dominated locations. They are expanding out, and being directed where they will have the most negative impact.Safer to try community-building in higher pop states that have entrenched groups on all sides against New invaders, ie the South sans Texas.

I still agree with the blogger Identity Dixie that the South should secede (did I spell that correctly?) and go “back to basics” with *aware* &amp; *awake* huwhyte Christians as it’s primary demographic, with the goal of re-building a unique America with non-Masonic virtues.

                    We are coming to a time when it will be disastrous to live in a place where you are a newcomer with no roots and connections. So don’t move to Maine.
Also, we are now well into the current cyclical Grand Solar Minimum (the “Eddy” GSM), and Maine might very well become uninhabitable in a few years.

        Twitter illustrates, for anyone with eyes to see, that we can’t live together anymore. Can’t talk to each other anymore. Hence, echo chambers. Anyone who, like Elon at Twitter, tries to create an environment that accomodates everyone, is doomed to fail. Accomodation is for people with common values.The Daily Mail was reporting on a poll that the left won’t publish, due to their disappointment that it shows a majority disapproving of the transgender madness. But the poll is just as much bad news for sanity, as it shows 40% approval of the transgender movement. 40%!!!! There’s no dealing with that. As I always say, if you find yourself in the position of having to explain why the crossdressing perv shouldn’t be going into the girls room, you’ve already lost.Irreconcilable differences. There’s a reason we call it AINO. What it used to represent is long gone.

            I doubt it is actually 40%. ALL polls are lies. ALL. The have to violate the foundational random sampling assumption to make the estimates, and the replacement methodology is wide-open for fraud if the pollster is dishonest, and they all. You can be sure that even the polls that show ‘bad news’ for the corporate left have been optimized to avoid public illumination of ‘worse news’.

                That’s probably true. But we are equally if not more damned by other percentages, the percentage who believe diversity is our strength for instance, or the percentage who believe the energy complex must be destroyed to save Gaia.

                I’m a semi driver who goes from coast to coast.
Last month in the heartland (Kansas) I saw a 9-10 year old white boy with pink clothing, purple nail polish, and rainbow flag earrings in both ears.  He was with his parents in the convenience store section of a truckstop.
I have been seeing this kind of thing more and more frequently and never saw it even 5 years ago.

                “I doubt it is actually 40%. ALL polls are lies. ALL.”
True. And many–perhaps most–will give the answer that they think will please the one asking the questions. And people have been conditioned to favor transgenderism, at least publicly. So the respondents will say what they think they are supposed to say. They don’t want to be different; they don’t want to be “bigots,” at least publicly.

I’m not so sure.
The 40% in support of the madness in the poll JZ mentions is similar to the ratio of support votes that show up on tranny stories on the Bing homepage that loads in my browser at work where I LARP as a normie.

        Elon is a progressive, an atheist, and a technocrat. He got richer from schemes that aligned with the regime’s goals (electric cars).
He’s just smart enough to see the direction we are heading, and the ruination if the far left (aka. American managerial empire) is not stopped. And he would never make it to Mars.
I suspect he’s like Trump – Trump wanted to go back to 1980, and Elon probably wants to go back to 1990. He wants to be a tech geek and family man free of insane social agendas and threats of violence.

            Elon is a creation of the Deep State [both public sector &amp; private sector], via Peter Thiel [who serves as the conduit for the fiat shekels].I would very much like to be a fly on the wall at one of their meetings, whoever they are &amp; wherever it is that they gather [perhaps Bohemian Grove?].They clearly appear to be non-j00ish [unless the Frankfurt School were sufficiently prescient to have created a secret goyische society to compete with the Frankfurt School, a secret society which never realized that it was created surreptitiously for the sole purpose of castrating &amp; annihilating itself].But I kinda doubt that.There are plenty of highly intelligent billionaire goyim in this country who know d@mned well what’s at stake here.And clearly they’ve got big plans for Elon &amp; Peter.

        Zman wrote, “Just as there was no saving King Louis XVI and the old order, there was no saving Tsar Nicholas II and the system that made him possible.”There was actually one way to save the Tsar regime: the Stolypin land reforms and building up a large middle class.  Lenin was *very* aware of this; Lenin saw the matter as a race with time between Stolypin’s reforms and the next upheaval. Should an upheaval be postponed for a couple of decades, the new land reforms would have made revolution much more difficult if not impossible.  The Moscow Times has summarized his career:“Pyotr Stolypin’s reforms produced astounding results within a few years. Between 1906 and 1915, thanks to the efforts of Stolypin’s farmers, the productivity of crops nationwide grew by 14 percent, in Siberia by 25 percent. In 1912, Russia’s grain exports exceeded by 30 percent those of Argentina, the United States and Canada combined.”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyotr_Stolypin#Interior_minister_and_prime_ministerStolypin was assassinated by a Jewish communist before the land reforms could truly succeed.Re: Musk, I can see your argument he is a man pushing for half-measures.  The weirdest and craziest thing of the whole Twitter purchase saga to me is that Musk made his offer while waiving due diligence.  Who does that?  What insanity!  He wanted to back out but the Delaware court was going to make him close on it anyway.  A prime example of the Peter Principle, I suppose.

Patton &amp; James Forrestal &amp; Joseph McCarthy in gubmint hospitals.Just like  Carl “Early Life” Weiss, which assassinated the existential threat to FDR’s regime, Huey Long.Just like Early Life’d Alexander Berkman &amp; Emma Goldman, which oversaw the assassination of William McKinley.Just like John Wilkes “Early Life” Booth, which assassinated Abraham Lincoln.A cynic might notice a pattern starting to form there.Which is precisely why it is of such overarching importance to Klownworld-Hellscape that pattern recognition is forbidden to be taught to American schoolchildren.

                    No, it was just another corollary of the Leninist “The worse, the better” doctrine. Kill the effective Stolypin to end his dynamically successful reforms, wipe out the immediate royal family to guarantee that there was no going back from the Bolshevik putsch.This is what we are currently seeing being put into practice under the Biden regime; creating chaos to such a degree that there is no way back to a viable society. They think that, at the end of decades of seditious preliminaries, they have judged the correct moment to “Finish the Job”. The commie stink is all over this.

                        The only hole in this is they’re already in charge, they couldn’t even bemorein charge and have been for decades.  Z’s take is probably closer, that they’re in strictly counter-revolutionary mode.  They’re trying to learn from every failed regime and seal the holes in the leaking hull in the hopes of keeping it from sinking.

Both the large-scale barbarism (willingness to make millions starve or otherwise suffer to usher in their goals) as well as the individual cruelty (the slaughter of the Romanovs – particularly the poor kids) is a reminder for all of us what these modern lunatics are capable of.

Yes.  But they don’t mess around with family-by-family annihilation – that’s for amateurs.  They go for civilization wide annihilation and gleefully brag about it.  Maybe the occasional Ruby Ridge just for sh*ts and giggles.

                    I think the fairer statement would be that Rasputin’s and Alexandra’s unlikability served as easy targets for their enemies, not the main cause. Those two seemed to provide a point of ridicule, but there were much larger, systemic issues. For example, Nicholas trying to command his army.

                        Rasputin was a supreme genius.
He was such an existential threat to The Tribe that the House of Rothschild ordered the s0d0mites in British Intelligence to have him liquidated.
It’s very very difficult to overemphasize what was lost to the West when the Tribe succeeded in eliminating Rasputin.

            That scene was depicted in the book “August 1914” by Solzhenitsyn.
It builds up beautifully, showing the religious fervour of the assassin, and the incompetent buffoonery of the Tsarist police state. Smoothly as butter, it leads right up to him pulling the trigger at the theater (and the assassins theater ticket was paid for by the secret service!). Almost inevitable, like it was always going to happen that way.
I read that book long ago but that passage is still one that stands out in my memory.

            All historical indications are that Stolypin was fully aware that he was likely to be assassinated on the trip and that he went anyway, almost as a form of suicide mission to protest his poor treatment by the Tsar. Before he left he took a cache of important personal articles and documents to a trusted advisor for safekeeping and with instructions on what to do with them should he not return. He left his bodyguard at home and did not wear protective gear that he normally would wear in public. And yes, he likely was assassinated to put an end to his land reforms, which were producing results.Re Musk: The best way to view Elon Musk is as the Howard Huges of space. Elon Musk is a proxy for the Department of Defense. He is a wealthy man because the DoD needs an entity that can reliably put rockets into space, but NASA can no longer perform this core function, and we all know why. Musk bought Twitter on behalf of the DoD, which is why he did not bother with due diligence. Twitter was effectively controlled by the State Department, and the DoD determined that the State Department controlling the largest surveillance and propaganda network in the world presented an unacceptable risk. Remember, the DoD has to play the role of the muscle and dead bodies behind the lunatic schemes cooked up at Foggy Bottom.

        This is a nice bit of history and a rhyme I have not heard of. I have not thought of the pressures on Musk and how they have likely led to the girl boss appointment. That said, he has for a long time employed the girl boss of girl bosses at SpaceX for a long time. I have never heard anybody say diversity as much as she does. I wonder how the army of young white guys working 20 hours a day there feel about that. My sources say, they are just enthralled with the mission and don’t give it the first thought. In any case, my point is, Musk may just be susceptible to the girl boss, or that may be part of his regime approval schtick. Consider his wives. The West is led by weak men. I suspect that also drives the hatred of Trump. His women are real women who stand behind him, not in front.Musk’s status is entirely dependent upon the system’s magical money printer and Fed governor incantations to turn his loss makers into wildly valued stock. SpaceX is equally dependent upon it since the government pays him to launch rockets and satellites and they too are dependent upon the same debt to extinguish debt mechanism. Every one of the 10 men at that table have wealth that will evaporate overnight for the same reasons as Musk. They won’t be penniless. They still have assets, but the valuations will be much lower, and a population dependent upon value inflated paper won’t be buying many new cars and gadgets.Musk is also compromised by the premise of why Tesla needs subsidies and why the conversion to battery storage applied to electric motors is essential. That is the regime’s premise. He got in bed with it a long time ago. I suspect that he didn’t get in bed with it because he is a genius, but because he was an imbecile who believed it himself.I would like to understand Mayorkas. He was at Biden’s side years ago when Biden was exalting the demise of Americans in our own homeland. He runs the department that oversees the mass invasion and that also oversees declaring white people, thinly veiling their demonization by calling them white supremacists, as the primary domestic terror threat. That department has all of the means of terrorizing its prime enemies at its disposal. He has tremendous power and several huge wrecking balls to swing.Nobody talks about him. Yet there he is, at the center of the greatest threat to our people.Who is this guy? Where does he come from besides what Wiki tells me? Who pays him? How did he get into this position and why? How did he end up as the guy, at least by all appearances that I can see, who is running the most important part of the revolution that has a bullseye pointed dead center on our people – the one who seems to cackle when Biden says he wants to, “finish the job.” It is about time somebody threw some torches down the roach holes he dwells in.

            I absolutely agree. Mayorkas is the greatest threat to our people since the Black Plague, and we know nothing about him other than some sketchy info about being a “Cuban” “refugee.” He seems like the final chapter in the Frankfurt School playbook. Also take note that Congress vowed to impeach this monster and has not done so.

                Right on Jack Dodson. The Brandon/Eff-Joe-Biden F-tards are on the wrong case. Mayorkas is an evil monster. I think someone on the DR should do a non-AlexJones exposee on him. If only Tucker and Musk would take that one on. Maybe Ramzpaul could do a special edition on this. It must be done.Nothing would be better for our people than to stop the Biden criticism and make the name, Mayorkas the most talked about name in America. It should always be uttered in the context of questions about who he is, where he comes from, why the invasion sponsorship, why in charge of fighting, “white supremacy” and protecting the American homeland, where does he worship, who does he meet with, where does he travel to, who does he speak with … … Parallels with whoever his Bolshevik analogs might be should be made as well.He has gotten on for far too long. He is a demon who seemingly has the desire and who definitely has the means to destroy us.

                        Exactly.  There are thousands of Mayorkases waiting in the wings.
Who is he?  Someone who expects to profit off the demise of the white man, financially and emotionally.  Probably never had a shot at the homecoming queen.   He quivers with an intoxicating combination of rage and fear when he hears Donald Trump’s growls.  And he pulls for the Borg when he watches Star Trek:  The Next Generation.  You know, all the usual commie things.

                    Ah! I see! I am not talking about dog and pony shows in Congress. I am talking about a DR blitz on this to force a Musk or a Carlson to address it and raise awareness with their audience. The thing we can do is move the Overton window and talking points. We can make Carlson, Bonegina, Karly Kirk and Matt Walsh give this oxygen. Right now, he is completely unchecked. Some scrutiny will do us some good. I’ve seen pictures of him with his own security detail and other in security detail very unhappy with him. Getting popular anger against him may give some on our side who do loathe him some breathing room.Even if there are a thousand Mayorkas waiting in the wings, everyone will be aware of his replacement and see his behavior matching.I doubt there are a thousand of him waiting. This revolution like all Revolutions has its lynchpin players. I suspect he has been at Biden’s side for years for a reason. Alejandro is not a pawn. He is a finger upon the pieces who must also be a player on the board. He meets with the inner circle.

                Because he is a ____ isn’t what I am interested in, nor is it what will be a torch in the roach hole that will burn long enough to give a good look to the number of people who need to see it. That question is a why, that may or may not be the why.Concrete questions about who and what have never been asked, much less, answered. You don’t get into his position and get the unopposed sanction to a project of this magnitude without a lot of support and coordination. We need Americans to look directly at him. Forget Biden. Dismissing questions about Mayorkas because you know the answer, a lame ‘he was born and raised that way’, won’t put the gaze on him long enough to cause a lasting and absolutely essential impression by a huge number of people. It will also hand him the easiest, and most immediate escape on a silver platter. See, this is a (insert the dismissive slander you know he will utter) and pretty soon he may be able to arrest you for that.We have to be smarter than walking right into the traps they’ve set.

Imagine a great Carlson exposee showing the pictures of him at Biden’s side a decade ago when Biden gloats on Normie’s replacement and piecing together what we know and putting questions in his head.
Congress’ dog and pony shows are not what I have in mind. Making a much larger population aware of him is the goal. Do not underestimate what that can do to help people with some power and knowledge of him get some breathing room.

                    Read my comment. We have Praetorian Guard that runs the show from behind the scenes. Do they meet every month and plan things out? No. They simply have a similar background and similar ideas and they find, vett and promote people like them, both ethnically, of course, and ideologically.So, yes, he has an enormous and very powerful organization behind him, and he uses his power to protect and promote that organization.(Again, by “organization,” I don’t mean one actual structure, but, instead, a confederation of many very wealthy people and organizations that have very, very similar goals run by people with the same ethnic background, which helps cohesion.)He’s part of the Guard, and they don’t mess around.

                        Yes. And he is public facing, and he owns the invasion. Greater public awareness and even some outrage could be a brake and could rattle the guard. He speaks with nervousness at times, so he feels heat. They are counting on us to just lay down in fear.
Do they play for keeps? Absolutely. Would they make a play that turned someone into a martyr? They just might. Do you think we are going to get out of this without that kind of thing happening?

                        This is a Uniparty thing.  Most Republicans also own this invasion, and that should be pointed out at every opportunity.  For decades, except for when a few stalwarts kept George W. “See You At The Signing” Bush’s amnesty from passing, they did nothing to stop it, while at the same time normalizing it, serving their corporate masters and the Chamber of Commerce.  They fought Trump on The Wall.  Do you hear any of them right now really raising a ruckus about it?  They are still delighted with the onslaught, and are as culpable as the Democrats.Heck, I don’t think Trump ever had a Department of Homeland Security boss who felt as strongly as he did about immigration.  Kris Kobach was the only possible choice for that position who did, and he was ignored, probably at McConnell’s direction.The Uniparty is the problem, not just one Democrat.

        Zman has written several times about the zero-to-minimal impact public opinion has on governmental policy. With that in mind, it seems highly unlikely that the endless blathering that takes place on Twitter matters much in terms of how the world actually operates. But does Twitter have a meaningful cultural impact? Perhaps. In the larger scheme of things, however, it’s more symptom than cause and will do little to accelerate or retard the general momentum of this wayward civilization.Which is my verbose way of saying that I don’t give a damn about Twitter. Like so much else in this culture, its significance is greatly overblown. Nevertheless, I’m open to opposing arguments about that.

                I suspect that if Twitter disappeared, some other platform would pop up to enable the regime and its SJW automatons to spread their poz. The regime would simply create a new one if need be. There is high demand among both elites and their minions for some tool by which they can promote their anti-civilizational degradation; that demand will be met, with or without current social media platforms.

                    Musk is a mixed bag at best.  The appointment of this feminati apparatchik as his successor demonstrates some of the problems with him well.All his utopian ideas make him suspect as well.  Like how we’re gonna send millions of people to live on a self-sustaining Martian colony or his solar roof tiles and underground roads will save us from the climate catastrophe and the horrors of traffic.  Don’t forget the self-driving cars operating as taxis for the masses who won’t be able to afford cars.OTOH, I do like the idea of “walkable cities,”  just not how they will be used as an excuse for making us no longer mobile by pricing cars out of the reach of ordinary people.You will live in ze pod, eat ze bugs and walk or take the bus.

                        If you read my commentary across time you will see I agree with you. This was a single point I was making. Namely, that Musk can do in a single tweet do what many great men haven’t been able to do in 30 years. He can expose tens of millions to stats and facts with a single tweet. There is value in that even though he is a subsidy truffle hound and speaks outright lies when they serve him.

            To the degree that it acknowledges public opinion, the government and its corporate outposts are run by “social media metrics.”
“Social media metrics” are determined by state, parastate, and QUANGO censorship, bots, and ops.
The recent wild escalation of our rulers’ insanity has been caused by this feedback mechanism they’ve built.

            Twitter, along with the likes of Facebook, NY Times, WaPo, etc., is a component of the Power Structure’s propaganda wing, and this is why there was so much alarm from on high when the suspected subversive Musk bought it. Twitter is, therefore, important to the Power Structure.But is it all that important culturally? Not terribly. Were Twitter to suddenly become a DR dynamo, the course of Western culture and politics would change very little for the simple reason that Twitter is just one megaphone/institution among myriad others, and every one of those others are dead set against the DR. If, however, the Muskification of Twitter produced a domino effect, this would mean something, and that is probably what the Power Structure fears most.

        The irony was that Mirsky’s departure made way for Pyotr Stolypin, an actual competent Minister who had a lot of good ideas and achieved quite a bit. Had the Czar and his wife not been so obtuse, Stolypin might have saved the regime. Does anyone here think we have even a remote chance of getting someone as capable as Stolypin to replace Biden?

        If you notice the styles that the homosexual janissaries of the system foist upon us, it’s always 1962.  “To Kill a Mockingbird” is always a best seller.  Those dumb, black rimmed glasses have been in styles for what, 20 years now?  That era was the absolute height of the system.  The more the system weakens, the more it longs for that golden era of its prime.  Architecture is currently a hideous gray rehash of that era.   Systems die because they’re at their prime for just a segment of time.  Everything is developed to serve the system in that time.  Over decades, the economy shifts and changes, the people change, what they value changes, but the system remains the same, only with new things running in the background.  The U.S. government as currently structured, is a post-war neoliberal state.  It’s a ghost of the mid 20th Century that lingers to this day, as the world rapidly transforms around it.  You’ll know we have a new system when no one is left wearing the dumb black glasses.

        Musk faces the same dilemma as Fox News. Despite the popularity of the product, the cabal that controls advertising will not tolerate criticism of the cabal. You see this clearly when you consider whose accounts continue to be  banned.Advertising is a strange business. First of all, it doesn’t work, or more accurately, the situations in which it does work are highly contingent and not replicable with much predictability. Repetition and serendipity are the only tools in the box. Those tools are not great for selling stuff, but they make for excellent propaganda.  Bud Light and Miller Lite, which are truly awful products, seem to be trying to outdo each other in this respect.Ultimately, the only way to defeat the cabal is with subscriptions, (which Musk is trying with the new blue checks, but I don’t think you can I’ve half in half out). Tucker should proceed with caution.

                    Just so. Any business or corporation wishing to signify its fealty to the Power Structure, the better to enjoy the crumbs from its table, can do so through advertising. Mudsharking blonde sauntering with a mandrill into a bedroom–that’s Power Structure meat and mead. A group of normal whites enjoying a meal together in a beautiful house with nary a Hutu in sight–the Power Structure puts a black mark in the corporation’s zapiska.

                    It won’t last. Historically, these evil creatures have zero toleration for alternative leadership. You could ask the Mensheviks about that, if the Bolsheviks had not exterminated them several years after cutting a deal with them (Mensheviks stop contesting leadership and go back to farms, Bolsheviks leave them be). If you were ever threat in Judeo-communist eyes, you will always be a threat, until you are dead.

        Musk is a very good example that no matter how rich you are or what level of politics you reach, you are still beholden to our modern Praetorian Guard.Musk is the richest man on earth. He bought Twitter. But the minute that he started to step out of line, the Guard swooped in and told him to tone it down – and he has. The Guard told his advertisers to pull out of Twitter – and they did.Our guard uses money, media, the courts/law enforcement, blackmail (Epstein and others are handy for that), their Woke mob for protests and, occasionally when actual violence is needed, Antifa in public or Mossad or similar types in private. In foreign domains, CIA-led color revolutions or, if needed, the US military acts as the Guard’s hammer.I wonder what it’s like to be Musk and to realize that you’re in charge as much as the Guard let’s you be in charge.Indeed, I suspect that much of the recent BRICs pushback is related to their full understanding that the Guard views every leader in the world as under its control.

            This is exactly why the reformer or the revolutionary needs its own Guard.This is also exactly why the Merchant’s Delusion that letting every merchant be free to be the best merchant is their own downfall. Rand will turn out to be one of the most laughable intellects with the most one dimensional view of society in history.Business is important, but left as the sole pillar for building and maintaining a great civilization, you get the Somalian town hall we just witnessed on Minnesota soil. Looking at the doughy, man-bunned white guy shouting, “Stop. This is America”, and then get dismissed and pushed off the stage by a bunch of hijab and burka wearing Somalis is a painful sight. We are going to have to get our act together to ensure that isn’t a premonition for a far bigger and more violent banishment from the stage at Town Hall.

                Yes, the successful businessman is extremely capable, but he’s no match for the mob – especially if the mob have taken over the government.Libertarian twats can never answer what an individual should do against an organized crime group that demands 10% of his business profits.Our country has been taken over by an ethnic crime family. Simple as that. And they play hardball. Is Musk or Bezos or Buffett willing to find people who will threaten, blackmail or even kill their opponents? I doubt it. But the people in charge will do that to them.Therefore, they’re not really in charge. They’re just extremely well-paid help.

        “In the end, reformers will be crushed by that old vice that has destroyed prior reformers.”The French and Bolshevik revolutions are the two modern examples, most frequently, cited, of  revolutionaries toppling a corrupt system that could no longer sustain itself. But the analogy may or may not apply here. Revolutions have been crushed, and dictatorships have prevailed.Even as I was reading this piece, an email arrived from my woke town’s D.I.E. committee. A discussion will be held, on Saturday, at the town’s community center, to take up the following questions:*What is the role of the white ally to Black and BIPOC communities?*How can you shed the cape of savior to become the warrior ally?The worst of progressive parasites may eventually be swept aside, but it’s too soon to predict that the beat won’t go on.

******I repent.  “Talking about A.I.” is almost certainly Schumer telling Musk to obey the Guard’s surveillance program or face consequences.  Sorry for the wild tangent.

        Y’know, Z… I wonder if you’re not reaching a bit on this one? Sure there’s much to be learned from history…but what’s happening in the insane unplumbed profundity of modern liberal America? I don’t see any parallels in old Czarist Russia.In that conflict people knew what they wanted. The players were on their teams, they knew who their teammates were, and by today’s standards they even had rules of sorts to play by. Today?The wahmen and queers don’t even know what they want beyond sodomizing your kids. The vibrants want free chit but will kill each other for it as readily as Whitey. As for Elon… he is No statesman, he’s not even a cloud person, nor does he seem to have any clout with the jews. In point of fact he’s  really a shyster… but a very good one at that.Twitter will only work and pay if both sides of the Great Divide use it. There is nothing to be gained by driving the left or the right out. He needs them both. In point of fact he is no real friend of the conservative right in any sense of the word.I suspect the new liberal Girl Boss is the same as the old conservative Mitch McConnel type paid actors. In his boots, I’d give the Girl Boss a script and a vibrant supporting cast of suitably vibrant co-stars… and her job will basically be PR work with the growing numbers of disenchanted lefties. Elon will do the same for the users from the right, if he can’t do it himself. Regardless though…HE  will be the decision maker and the last call will be his own. Elon doesn’t give a hoot about people or issues, he is about $$$$. Why – He’d dump Twitter in a heartbeat if he could get his money out of it!We live in wonderful times, really. The mass media is on life support. Alternatives to controlled social media are everywhere. There will be very little money to be made with them, and incredible fortunes can be lost on them.Things will go kinetic soon, unless something can be worked out. Men like Elon and his girl boss will have no say in that whatsoever…

It is a solid be that the dude is looking for the first exit ramp. In addition to being evil, the Regime is batshit crazy. Imagine putting up with those psychopaths every day when you can afford to avoid them.

        I don’t think the metaphor of Musk as Mirsky holds in this case. The Z-Man has a Procrustean bed called “the system must be destroyed,” so he goal-seeks every metaphor to that end.
I rather doubt that Musk has any set of higher ideals that he operates by. He is a government subsidies whore and, through his validation of the electrical vehicle scam with is Tesla company, a major destructive force in his own right. I don’t care for him.

            Musk is a dreamer.  Twitter detracts from his attention to his other “ideas”.  Most of what he dreams about is pretty half-baked, but I assume he has fun with them and his public seems to ignore valid criticism of such fantasies in their idolization.

        So where are we headed?But first, some background. Societal models were initially developed as tools of research, then as tools of advertising/sales, then as tools of prediction, and finally as tools of mass social manipulation. The latter is now being used skillfully to both control and modify macro social behaviors. And the goals of these efforts are as diverse as the array of power-players using them. They do this because it “works” so it’s not going away any time soon.This phenomenon is a bit like hypnosis in that it can only take you so far before primal fail-safe mechanisms kick in. This is how revolutions occur and sustain themselves. And starvation (or abject hunger) is often the critical driver. As such, the only reliable way to postpone revolution is to keep the plates spinning as long as possible. Which gets evermore difficult as prolonged affluence eventually kills off productivity.The West is currently facing a key tipping point. They gambled on being able to rape Ukrainian and Russian resources as a means of keeping the plates spinning for a few more decades, but that is about to go up in smoke. And when the smoke clears, the revolution begins. It will start in Europe.

            “And when the smoke clears, the revolution begins. It will start in Europe.”I’m willing to bet the rent that a digital “currency” will be forced on us before the 2024 “elections,” assuming that they are held at all, which I don’t. And even if they are, it won’t matter. The Communists will gain total control of every branch of  FedGov.Once they’ve got us handcuffed with the digital “currency,” they will ration gasoline and food, probably in that order.When they have most of the population occupied 24/7 with trying to figure out where their next meal will come from, “they” will restrict the number of calories/day/person, and hungry people, although desperate, lack the energy and health to prosecute a revolution. Or anything else.Not that that matters in the Grand Scheme of Things, though, b/c “they” are at this very moment importing a cadre of soldiers to disarm the American people.They have it all figured out. Their plan will go well for them. The plan is not new, and it is not the result of haste and the lack of resources. The only thing “they” really lacked was *reliable* manpower to disarm the population, but they have that now, or they very soon will.I believe that we ARE going to live under a brutal police state for 8 or 9 years. Then there will be a real revolution. (And yes, the people will have weapons. “They” won’t be able to confiscate–or even find–most of them.)

        It’s amusing watching Musk cause lunatics to melt down, and I had fun watching the Trump “Town Hall,” in which the CNN female robot kept getting so angry it looked like her circuits were about to fry. But neither Musk nor Trump is a Great Man in the sense Carlyle defined it. Trump at least is a “Big Man,” in the anthropological sense, the kind who could defend a tribe or a village or a castle fiefdom pretty ably enough.I have trouble even comparing Musk to Carnegie or Mellon, who at least gave us some beautiful architecture. Musk meanwhile is cluttering up low earth orbit with cubesats and his b.s. cars are basically a libel against internal combustion, which is still the best method we’ve got for the personally owned auto. His restoring Andrew Anglin and getting rid of Kevin MacDonald on twitter also would suggest that, like Trump, he’s mostly an entertainer.I also think we’ve passed the potential of reforming the elite, even with help from sympathetic/sane elites. Greed is one thing, but if left unchecked, it descends into true degeneracy and then madness. Someone like Pelosi is in the Howard Hughes/Michael Jackson realm of unreality, or King Ludwig spending his empire’s entire fortune to create a lavish production of an opera. Soros has stated he views himself as an Old Testament God, literally quoted in the LA Times as “the creator of Everything.” We’re in the “Sun King” realm, the brains poisoned by arsenic-based makeup powder, towering wigs, orgies in halls of mirrors while the peasants starve terrain.If anything, a reasonable elite like Musk is just delaying the inevitable, perhaps dangerously, like telling yourself you’ll just take a quick nap after getting a concussion, after which you’ll head to the hospital. It reminds me of what Ernst Von Salomon overheard an Organisation Consul member saying after he attended a Walter Rathenau speech. “He will be killed soon, as he is too reasonable.” A month later Rathenau got chopped down by an MP-18 on his way home to the Grunewald.

        “In the end, reformers will be crushed by that old vice that has destroyed prior reformers.”Radicals already have crushed the system. Musk is the equivalent of Mirsky tinkering with the Russian Empire after the Czar and his family were taken to the basement. Just yesterday the “Department of Justice” declared that the coup is old news and all is well. The radicals are mopping up now, which Musk and many would-be reformers are belatedly discovering.There indeed may be a Thermidorian Reaction over the horizon, but Musk isn’t Napoleon and Twitter isn’t the White Terror. This thing will burn until there is nothing left to burn, which may not be all that far off.

        Arguably the disaster for Tsarist Russia from WW1 provided the essential catalyst for revolution. Without it the Tsarist regime could probably have hobbled on. Likewise for pre-revolutionary France: the high expense of the war with the British of 1756-1763 probably provided the catalyst for successful revolution. In both cases enfeebled regimes could have stumbled on but add a crisis and they were toast. Probably likewise for the enfeebled US regime: some crisis will be the catalyst for radical ( dare I say revolutionary?) change. Since there are several latent and incipient crises on the horizon to choose from, tis but a matter of time.

            The Russo-Japanese war was the crucial error. That humiliation is what set the ball rolling. It is also an example of how an ossified and incompetnat regime staggers into disaster. Washington’s support of Ukraine looks similar. Like the Russian in 1904, Washington was sure this would be simple.

                I would argue Iraq ushered in the revolution, and the accident of Trump was a glimpse of a possibly real Thermidor over the horizon that caused the Regime to go mad(der). The miscalculation over Russian sanctions may indeed be the predicate that takes down the Regime, which has been a revolutionary government much like the provisional Kerensky version since Iraq paved the way for Obama. Here’s to hoping the Whites prevail this time.

                Unrelated, perhaps, but what a pyrrhic victory for Japan.  First, it was by no means easy, and in the end it led to them into believing a lot of things about themselves that just weren’t true.

“The Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy” by Lothrop Stoddard cites Russia’s loss of the Russo-Japanese War as the starting point for where we are now.
Highly recommended.

                It was also completely avoidable, if their foreign military intelligence hadn’t been so incompetent. The Japanese were competently fighting an industrial civil war at the same time our ancestors were fighting our American Civil War. They had ironclads, too. That the Japanese were not the usual Russian adversary of disorganized low-IQ central Asian rabble would have been apparent, had they but looked.

            I like the Qing Dynasty China example. They had a very messy second half of the 19th century, which started the “century of humiliation” until Mao took power. First the Europeans came and set up shop, their activities destabilizing and humiliating the Qing regime. This let to the Taiping Rebellion, which happened about the same time as the US Civil War, and was much bloodier. South China was basically a separate state until Qing armies, hollowed out as they were, came to retake it. Europeans smelled blood and began to get more aggressive. The Boxer Rebellion was the final, impotent reaction of a dying empire.Dynastic China is a great example of gradually, then suddenly.I think we’re too big to decline as a result of a shocking loss (the Russians with Japan, the Brits with Suez). We will carry on as a bloated corpse until people start fleeing Washington. “The sick man of North America” they’ll call us.

                    It seems like Trump *was* our Kerensky.
Change “for the better” seems pretty iffy, but I dunno; perhaps the Griller wisdom might win out.
That is, ignore the idiots with their sound and fury.  Eventually they’ll start a fire and burn their own house down; meanwhile, the peasants will hoe their own potatoes, and just keep on keepin’ on.
A decline in post-1940 20th C. living standards is still far and away “better off” than any other time in history.

And, it rhymes!  The Ottomans and the Chinese transitioned little kids, into troupes groomed to be homosexual entertainers and prostitutes for the rich.

                Re: “fleeing Washington”: Had to drive thru CT, NYC, NJ, Del, MD, DC, N VA, this weekend on Mother’s Day. Yikes. I haven’t done this for 8 yrs. The area is impossible. Traffic beyond hope. Any normal person who has to deal with this on a daily basis is going to die young. Bloated corpse is a good description. The place is a 21st century mill town. Sending your children to an Ivy League academy will get them a “job” with the government for sure, but wouldn’t you like to have grandchildren someday?In the good old days, say 60 years ago, you graduated from Dartmouth, like your Dad did, your Mom from Smith, and returned home to Cleveland, Ohio, where you took a job as an executive with an iron ore shipping company. You got to live in a nice home in a nice suburb, had your choice of downtown clubs to have lunch in during the work week, and an excellent golf club for recreation and holiday parties. Your wife, who had an equally fine education and a post-graduation job with a publishing company in NYC, now was the mother of several children and volunteering with interesting organizations like the Art Museum or the Botanical Garden. Thursday evenings you enjoyed attending the Symphony Orchestra. Sundays you were in church with a top-notch minister/rector and the kids were in Sunday school with their friends. I’d better stop here so that you can get a handkerchief to wipe away your tears.
