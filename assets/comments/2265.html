        It could not be more obvious that the greatest obstacle to a conservative emergence is the Republican Party.

        “Last time I checked, they don’t have another Magic Negro ready to com in for 2016”
True, but that’s only because they have moved on from “Yes We Can” to “Vote for the Vagina”

        The Republican Party badly needs to split up.  In 1854 the Party split, with the then “RINO”s going their own way into deserved obscurity.  The Repubs didn’t win elections for six years until they put a President in the White House in 1860; a President who, by the way, fundamentally changed America.At the time they were quite radical, which frankly is what they need to be now.  I get a kick out of far left Dems and their Media pointing out how “radical” the conservative wing of the Republican Party is.  It’s a great joke.Leftists are too sly to be voted out of office; they have to be driven out by true radicals waving the banner of our radical Constitution.

Don’t forget the educational system. It amazes me that 90% of the country is not leftist with the 0-22 years old indoctrination program.

        I hope you are right.  I hope Obama is a one-off.  I hope Brimelow’s Traditional American Nation isn’t sandbagged by the Republicans.

        If it were 1980, and the country had 1980 demographics, I’d say your analysis was spot on.  However, that horse has left the barn.According to the Rasmussen Poll for July 19, 47% of those surveyed approved of Obongo’s job performance as president.  84% of Dems approved of his job performance.  A fresh Dem face will easily pick up the few extra points.While I personally despise the little shit, and that colors my thinking, objectively there is no question that he is the worst president the country has had at least since the 19th Century.  However, he is the right color and he says the right things.  There is no question the left wants to use the mestizos to establish permanent control of the government.  They probably already have done it.All of The Diversity, including the East Indians and the fabled, high I.Q. North Asians, are lining up to get Whitey and that is only going to get worse.  The jews will always vote hard left and throw their considerable money and influence that way.  Single women and the Millenials are in the tank as well.  The Media is rabidly leftist.  If big immigration changes are made, the Media will be beating the ‘racist’ drum nonstop, and they don’t even bother with facts anymore.  The court challenges would tie up the legislation for decades.The Pubs will put up either a sell out (a la Rand Paul), and/or a dishrag candidate.In any event, the contenders are all lightweights.The battle for the country was fought and lost in the 1970s and now all we can do is let the sorry mess play out.

            I would not take Rasmussen seriously. He likes to generate these attention getting polls to get the Right worked up. I look at Gallup, which has its faults, but is at least consistent over time. The defects in current Gallup polls were present in those of previous administrations.Obama has been hovering in the 40-45% bandfor a year.George Bush was slightly higherat this point.The adjustment I make for these comparisons is this. A Republican is much more likely to lose conservatives than a Democrat is to lose liberals. Democrats are fanatically loyal which makes the 40% threshold key. Jimmy Carter never fell below 40% until after the midterm. It was the spring of ’79 when it became obvious that he was not up to the job. That’s when he dipped below 40%.Obama is a unique figure and his floor may be 40% simply because he is black. That’s a huge cushion under him. It’s what holds his coalition together. Last time I checked, they don’t have another Magic Negro ready to com in for 2016.

        Nope. No hope. We will end up like the Brits and the French (and most of Europe), wondering how to get rid of the illegals we fooled around and let in.
Maybe we should let them ALL in, then we move to the Mideast.

            We’re all Ian Douglas Smith, circa 1964, right now. The trouble is there’s no place to run if we choose not to fight.
