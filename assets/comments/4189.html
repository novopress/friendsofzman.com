        LBJ was an unstable psycho who got naked in front of female staff and invited them in the bathroom when he took a dump. His policies were reckless and irresponsible as well – civil rights, immigration etc.

        More politically active and right-leaning Asian-Americans, coupled with disgruntled Jews and of course the business-friendly libertarian wing of the existing GOP might form some kind of a future.

            You are assuming that the GOP is actually offering an alternative.  A big part of the GOP just wants to go along and get along with the Dems.  The schism in the GOP will need to be dealt with as part of the evolution of the parties, and the split in the Republican Party will be exploited by the liberals every step of the way.  The Dems hold the coats and offer to “let you and him (both Republicans) fight it out”.

        “The software of the GOP is built for a different age to face a different opponent. That means the GOP will have to change to match the Democrats, but into what?”
An ideological party built around small government, sacred citizenship, and avoiding foreign military adventures?…

            Competing ideological parties are going to end up with one completely defeating the other. ideologies simply don’t play well with others. They are like religions in that regard. My sense is the Liberal Democrats, after a period of dormancy, will come back more virulent and militant in another fifteen years and finish off the old coalition system.

            Jews can be loyal to the party
Of course. That’s not the issue. The issue is can they exist in an ideological party and the evidence says they can’t eventually, the ideologues turn on them.

            Bad question, grey. Why would a conservative want to be loyal to the Republican Party?
Levin loves the  lost America of the Federalist more than he loves Jews, no contest, and vocally detests the Schumer’s of the world. He’s probably representative of, well, many dozens of Jews.
