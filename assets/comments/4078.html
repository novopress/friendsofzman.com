        I know a number of progressives who hate Starbucks because it’s run by a Jew. Let the baristas get an earful of that talk about race.

        “…a snotty lesbian with a face full of fishing tackle.” – See, now this is a fine example of the main reason I stop by here routinely. Great imagery.

        Have you noticed that going to make a purchase at a ‘progressive’ business these days has become more and more like going to church? (Altogether, brothers and sisters…)

            Yes, it is a stupid marketing stunt. Starbucks, however, is a whites-only company. The way to beat back this rage virus of anti-racism is ti change the terms. Uninfected people need to talk about the ethnic cleansing in liberal areas and the not-so-subtle racism of companies who cater to the infected.

                    It is not wasting your time. My experience is that they are thunderstruck. I congratulate them on living black free and taking care that their kids do also because I know from experience how difficult that is, having failed at this myself.

        This is arrogance on an absurd level. It is the arrogance that the young and the ‘socially aware’ — who have never actually had much to do with anyone but their own insipid kind — not only want to detain a paying customer (and don’t we all hate capitalism that provides all these shitty jobs when we could all be working in the factory or swilling pigs out under the commissar’s glare, right?) to talk about something they have little experience of but even more so, that they have anything interesting to say on the matter.The only conversation one would need to have is the server asking: ‘Excuse me, but is that enough bits added or would you like more?’ the correct  response would ‘yes’ or ‘no, put in more.’You can imagine queueing (standing in line) while someone fusses around over adding some frivolous extra and nattering about race ‘issues’ to the waiting customer ahead of you and then yourself having to endure the same conversation a couple of minutes later. Put yourself further down the line and you would be at screaming point by the time they served you.However I am not a SJW so what do I know of life? I expect Starbucks have plenty of customers who not only like their bitter, unpleasant drinks but are eager and equally arrogant enough to think this is a meaningful way to spend their time.

        Starbucks isn’t lecturing us, it’s just using a marketing gimmick to make money.
