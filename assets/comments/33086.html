        “Generations ago, the Prime Minister would have served in the military and maybe even seen war.”
Mediocrities indeed.  Reminds one of a great bit of writing.
From C.S. Lewis’sThe Abolition of Man:
“And all the time… In a sort of ghastly simplicity we remove the organ and demand the function. We make men without chests and expect of them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honour and are shocked to find traitors in our midst. We castrate and bid the geldings be fruitful.”

            It still amazes me how wise men of old could see and predict our problems when the problems must have been so small in their day that it would be “the good old days” to us.

                Indeed.  Everything is relative.  I could imagine what they’d call a “mediocre man” in those days would be seen in our time as a “great man”.  Such is our current decline.

                i’ve been reading a number of essays like this lately.  may i humbly offer a concise summary of the genre.

                    The madness seems compounded when one thinks of how the services would have reacted in those days to such perversions.  The few “old timers” I’ve known from the military must be spinning in their graves.  The stories I’ve been told are so removed from today’s “norm”. It’s like another world—and indeed it is.

            Could it be that men are simply conforming to the presence of women in their ranks?
We know women tend to run on consensus.  No woman wants to be held accountable for her decisions and so she builds consensus so that she cannot be blamed for the group’s decision should things not go as planned.
We have no leaders because the system selects for committee men and girl bosses.

                Good thought.  I have to admit, I’ve begun to think about this more with wife as we grow old.  In her case, it’s a complete refusal to make any decision.  We cannot go out to a restaurant of her “choice”—because she won’t choose.  She will however ask where I’m going when I decide to get lunch out. If I’ve chosen “correctly” she’ll have me bring something back, but will never voice a preference if I ask “where would you like me to go”?Such trivial decisions extend to important ones as well.  Currently she has a car that is unreliable—and cannot be diagnosed/fixed—it simply at times does not start.  The last time I had to rush out late at night to pick her up, I said “That’s it! Get rid of it at Carvana or some other vendor.  Go out and buy another one.”  I even took out the money, put it in the account and drove her to dealerships.  Test drove cars.  No decision.  Why?  Well I guess it comes back to thinking, “What if this car is also a lemon?”So the bottom line is a non-reliable car permanently parked in the garage, while my truck is now used by her instead. She dares not drive the EV because “it’s electric” and “different”.  Yeah, it’s different, it doesn’t have a key—it’s got a button to start.  There’s not a thing different from any vehicle on the road.  Hell, I even set it to make (faux) engine noise” when you accelerate.   😉You know, I’d like a bit of help these days myself…

                I subscribe to a Reddit channel about job hunting. One of the most common horror stories is the endless rounds of interviews story. Someone will reply to a job ad and go through, say 2 rounds of interviews. Then they find that there are actually 6 more or they need to do a couple “team” interviews or a take-home assignment. I’m sure this has nothing to do with women’s notorious inability to make a decision with incomplete information or their desire to offload the decision to some committee or, worse, some kind of “scoring system”. “Well Jones scored really well on his knowledge of algorithms but his diversity essay seemed insincere and like it might have been written by ChatGPT so the trans-gender midget edged him out on total points.”The amusing thing is that Reddit posters are notoriously woke and thus they will do all sorts of bizarre contortions to dance around the obvious problem – We put a bunch of damn fool stupid women with useless degrees in charge of hiring for just about every job and it takes them forever to get anything done.

                    Could be. It could also be that the interviews are going on long enough for the DEIs who are supposed to get hired disqualify themselves. Much as EEOC hates it, punctuality and reliability can still be factored into hiring decisions.

            seem to recall germany initiated attack on russia in the past.  also recall german ground was held by russia to maintain safe zone from future attacks.  pretty sure germany agreed to never do it again, but here we are.  maybe its germany who seeks the return of prussia?  as i see it, germany has no integrity and no seat at the table.  why does germany maintain a prince of prussia?

        I hate to be Debbie Downer here, but I don’t think a far better class of men could do much. Not at this late date. Look at the run-up to WWI. For all the blame we can legitimately assign to the Tsar and the Kaiser, the nuts and bolts of it fell on men who might’ve been mediocre in their day, but they’d be titans in ours. The problems were all structural: The Tsar needed to be pan-Slavic to shore up his authority at home after defeat in the Russo-Japanese war and the subsequent revolution. France was still smarting from defeat at Sedan. The British quite rightly feared the loss of their empire after getting rolled at the Berlin Conference, and barely defeating the Boers. A better class of political leaders might’ve prevented war… in 1885 or thereabouts. By 1914 it was too late, structurally, and that seems to be where we are now.

            Yeah, my fear is the train left the station thirty years ago. It is as if the managerial elite feels it needs to be punished and what better punishment than to be incinerated in a nuclear flash? My hope is the punishment is a carrier with a big hole in it from a missile strike. Such an image might be enough to terrify the economic elite into purging the system. or maybe the system merely collapses. Not great, but better than nuclear war.

                    Tangentially, they don’t believe a West ruled by normal, competent white men deserves to exist. They’ve done everything in their power to marginalize such men domestically, and seem to be itching to incinerate such folk in the Slavic world as well.

                        Our political system selects for weaker men and girl bosses by making the process so awful that only the most degenerate would go through it.Who wants a media- and activist-led proctoscopy into their personal life? For the rich guys, they just find a cutout willing to subject themselves to that tomfoolery and sign the front of the checks.Democracy is all about the art of the compromise and that extends to its leadership or lack thereof. Strong, principled people are marginalized since real leaders don’t “lead from behind” like Obama said about Syria, but could’ve been applied everywhere else in the western system.Our political system is so catty and feminized. Instead of policy debates, we have “you go girl” catfights between male and female candidates for office.

                    This. Golden Child psychology is hard to understand from the outside because it is formed in a world that the rest of us can no longer believe in. The search for stupidity, delusional narratives, and a subconscious demand for penance is an attempt at a shared reality, but no, those are second order effects and one vestigial organ.The Golden Child was born in a world where their every whim and desire was given to them. All they had to do was ask, and the Deus ex Machina that managed their reality responded. No matter how feckless or petulant their demand, reality responded. A child is not sophisticated enough to understand their mother’s role in this, and no child can parse out the virtualization of their world from the mechanisms of actual reality. The closest they get to an honesty of their condition is the need to deify the mother in their personal myth and to give the Queen Mother her throne in the halls of power so everyone can see whose desires shape them.It is even easy to assume that the Golden Child’s need to expel all other desires from the consensus is simple narcissism, but it may also be a developed instinct that fears that the mechanisms of the Machina are feeling fickle enough to listen to a contrary opinion today.This should terrify you, because no matter what happens, their life has taught them that the strength of their desires will force mom to submit to them in the end, and with mom, the world. Deus ex Machina always has the Charge of Helm’s Deep building up over the horizon. Any moment now, and the world will see that the truth of their desires always wins, or be destroyed in narcissistic rage.

                The managerial elite has absolutely no clue it can die or be killed. The dumber it is the more convinced it is of its immortality, to the degree it even realizes death is certain. The economic elite has late in the day noticed the psychosis, and as you write the question is whether it will move to purge the system. I am not convinced it will. I like Sev’s analogy to WWI but the presence of nukes makes this infinitely worse, and, yes, it is possible to be worse. In a better day, a semi-competent military would engineer a coup, but the contemporary Pentagon is just as detached from reality as the rest of the managerial elite.The only reason this hasn’t popped off yet is because Putin until only very recently believed the West was still managed by the rational people he encountered while a KGB officer in East Berlin. Now that he sees the full-scale lunacy that has gripped D.C., Berlin, London, and Paris, all bets are off.

                            That’s a topic for conjecture…I doubt there’s much reputable research on the topic. I’ve read enough “all out nuclear war” scenarios over the years. If one leaves aside the silly science fiction stuff (e.g. mutants, aliens, etc.) the harsh truth is that a major nuclear exchange would be bad for business. As a youth I recall asking my Dad about such scenarios and he said “All bets are off.”What I’ve never seen explored is what about a very limited nuclear war? Clearly that’s a better outcome all things considered, but even if by some miracle a wider war was averted, I would expect dire damage to becomes, world trade, stability of many governments, and so forth.To paraphrase an obscure stock market commentator a few decades back, the day that we hear that someone cracked off a thermonuclear bomb in anger, even if it didn’t affect us directly, we shall have far more pressing matters to worry about than the value of our 401K or brokerage accounts.

                    Putin likely has better options (than nuclear) and is probably a good enough leader to avoid making tragic mistakes.He has Xi on his side. At a minimum, China could provide Russia with enough material support to defeat NATO.  China could likely outproduce the rest of the world combined.  But they only need to outproduce the hollowed out NATO economies.  This would be a great benefit to China and they wouldn’t even have to fight and would put Russia in so much debt that they could count on Russian energy for the next 50 years.  With NATO (US) defeated, Taiwan would have no choice but to become part of China again.

            I think a major difference is “mediocre men” in 1913 joined the civil service and military, and today they go into other industries like tech or finance. This leaves the govt staffed with mostly retards or conformists. The hope is that the various Western govts are just theater, while the real Men of Action in the West can either roll their eyes or put a stop to it with a phone call.We can make fun of Macron and Starmer and Biden, but I can’t believe they’re doing anything but LARPing as “statesmen” while global finance and non-Western leaders put them in check.

                There is reason to believe this is true. Sorry I can’t find link, it may have been in The Guardian, it was some publication on that level, in which Boris Johnson was quoted, talking about his actions during the plandemic (this was part of the piling on after he resigned), referring to otherwise inexplicable action he’d taken he said “I had to. They made me.” Without saying who “they” were.

                    Good observation!  Z-man is quite correct in his assessment of the men of the managerial class but today that class is staffed increasingly by women who are constitutionally unable to govern effectively.  They are even less willing than men to buck the narrative and will go along with even crazy ideas just to fit in with the group.  I note that most (not all, certainly, but most) of the Russian and Chinese leaders are still men.

                Maybe in this country, but I don’t know about that for the rest of the world. In the rest of the world, the best and brightest generally strived for positions of power within the government. At least that’s how things were traditionally. Not that they achieved anything other than mediocre results, however.A recent illustration of this could be seen with Tucker Carlson’s interview of Vladimir Putin. Whatever his merits, you could see that Tucker looked like a lightweight compared with someone of Putin’s stature.Tucker’s skills are perfectly adequate with the light weights who run our government, but he was completely out of his element speaking with somebody of true gravitas like Vladimir Putin.

                “These are all pipe dreams. With what $$, expertise, or leaders?”It’s really the leadership and the *will*.  It can be done.  Look, Musk is launching rocket ships.  Two decade ago, that was the sole purview of NASA.  It can be done.  Microsoft bought the 3 Mile Island power plant for its electricity needs stemming from AI and Cloud storage.  Designs for small “salt” reactors are on the books and one is said to be operational in China.  It can be done.The problem is one of will.  Of course, it does not help that the country has been (purposefully) divided into quarreling camps of racially divided peoples.  Sigh.

                    Sorry friend, but I must disagree.  Saying that ‘will’ makes these things possible is awfully close to Zman’s point how “the world can be set aright if the managerial elite has the will.”  One cannot ‘will’ reality into being.  It takes power and violence and the materiel to turn will into anything more than wishes.

                        I get your criticism, I’m not sure I made myself clear.  The will I talk about is not managerialism.  These things are not “committee” decisions, but one of leadership through strongmen.  Musk is one of them.  Microsoft I can’t be sure of, only that they broached the taboo of nuke power when in their corporate interest.

                            The places that traditionally nurtured the strongmen, chiefly the military and corporations, have been thoroughly feminized and taken over by degenerates. So I think this is really the problem of where else we can look. I’d say the only places you find these men today are among the John Galt types**. Musk of course is a good example but Trump is also one. In fact I think this may be a lot of why Trump is so hated. It’s not really what he says or even what he does, it’s who heISthat terrifies them. They look at Trump, Musk, and other guys at that level and see a power that doesn’t fully answer to their control.** John Galt: I know, I know, libertarians, Ayn Rand, and other stupid stuff. What I’m evoking here is not some myth of the self-made man but simply the idea of a decisive loner who thinks for himself.

                        Zman was referring more it seems to geo-political realities – i.e., willing Russia’s economy to collapse will not make it happen.  If I understand correctly, Compsci is referring more to technical realities – many of which exist (e.g., nuclear power) but the political will to make use of them is not there.  If they can print money to fund wars, they can print money to fund deportations.

                    “Will”? Sorry Compsci, but I have to take 3g’s side here too. For a more earthy opinion, look no further than one of the hardcore unofficial slogans of Alcoholics Anonymous. When an optimistic newcomer thinks he’ll address his drink problem via willpower, a streetwise sponsor would tell him, “Sure buddy! Why don’t you take a package of Ex-Lax and tell me how your willpower works.”

            Yeah, I sort of take issue with Z’s blanket assertion that the people in the think-tanks and so on are all dweebs with no connection to reality. That may in fact be true for a lot of them, but the criticism of the intellectual not knowing anything practical has been around since Aristophanes mocked Socrates inClouds.The fact is that if we look at 1914, the people in charge were far more practical and far more experienced, the professional military men in France and Prussia had all seen combat from the 1870 war, yet they got ten million men killed for nothing in the trenches anyway. Churchill experienced war as a young man and that didn’t stop him from wanting a second war with Germany 20 years after the first one got 750,000 British men killed.“Practical,” experienced men can be wrong and stupid in their own ways just as cloistered academics can.The truth literally lies in between, Aristotle emphasized phronesis, practical wisdom that is informed by critical thinking and intellectual analysis.I hear construction-type guys say college is bullshit, but the diesel engines in their trucks and the hydraulic cylinders of their backhoes were all designed by guys who went to college.

Finish the sentence. “Went to college and then went out and did something with that knowledge.” There’s the key distinction.
To way too many of the cloistered STEM profs, the world effectively stagnated at the moment they earned tenure. Thus the “one funeral at a time” aphorism.

                The sending troops talk shows a concerning level of fantasy in these people.
Yes, believing that long-range missiles will cause the Russians to collapse or Putin to get overthrow is stupid, but, at least, there are actual missiles being launched. The troops quite literally can’t be sent. They have almost no ability to even get them to the front, much less supply them, much less replace their loses.
It’s one thing to fantasize about the outcomes of an action that actually happened; it’s another to fantasize about the outcomes of action that itself is a fantasy.

                ‘but in reality it would be their best units, which are all white men of high character’
Yes, this is the empire’s problem.  It spent the past half-century crowbarring-in its Female and Of Color revolution.  But it’s the (officially despised) white males who keep the lights on and the sewage plant running.
This serves to ratchet-up their resentments and envy at being unable to be what they are not.

                        I wonder if Trump’s election and the naming of an anti-DEI SecDef will trigger a renewed interest in military service among young white men.  I am more open, but not sold yet, to recommending the military to young relatives that need the discipline and a way out of a crappy situation.  Times have sure changed since I went in at age seventeen in the 70s.

                Isn’t it oxymoronic to believe in men of “high character” who have low moral intelligence and low street smarts? Those soldiers’ manipulability and eagerness to kill for a mafia of mediocrities, insatiable capitalists, and Zionists is evidence of low moral intelligence. Their enthusiasm to obey and to die for mediocrities, insatiable capitalists, and Zionists is evidence of low street smarts.Maybe the matter of street IQ can be separated from character. But how?After correcting your premises, a good strategy for precisely subverting the military commands of the USA, UK, France, Poland, etc. ought to suggest itself. Meanwhile, it remains true that the soldiers whom you revere werenot raised rightandnot educated right. Probably they weren’t even bred right. The high character which you perceive is illusory and imaginary.Those soldiers are degenerates, as are Keir, Olaf, Emmanuel, and Joe. When it comes to degenerates in a government and its military, like attracts like.Degenerates obey a fellowdegenerate.As above, so below.

                There aren’t enough divisions in NATO to even move the lines forward even a kilometer in most sectors. And here’s a dirty little secret: How ready are these divisions for war?
When our squadron shipped out to Iraq, our maintenance crews worked double shifts for weeks trying to get every one of our aircraft in perfect shape. I don’t know if NATO is doing the same effort.

            An expeditionary force would work against some third world country like Mali, but putting them into Ukraine and hoping anything would change is fool-hardy, unless they bring their own artillery and air support and all the rest of it, in which case, its not a expeditionary force, but a full fledged invasion force.

            If I may make a modest suggestion, I would send along the homeless and the asylum-seekers (often overlapping there). In my area of exurban Florida, the past year or two these are easy to spot since they often sport backpacks; it’s pretty easy to differentiate these from “real” backpackers or students, neither of who are common in my area. Alternately, one sees them on bikes with bags (and obviously not cycle tourists that are rare in my area.) I can’t speak for the whole nation, but I can say for a fact the situation is not far different in the Kansas City area, where I just visited. These are clearly people who are at least of moderate fitness: they can walk or bike about. They also have informal experience sleeping rough and living at the expense of others. Why not send them to basic training and ship their asses to Ukraine? Those who come back may have learnt marketable skills and/or might qualify for residency.

Someone pays for theCenter for Strategic and International Studies. Someone back Starmer and Macron. This is the problem with democracy. We have no idea who is really in charge but someone is and it’s not Starmer or Macron or, even as powerful as they are, the Kagen cult.

            The fear and likely reality is that the oligarchs who select the managers also are of infinitely lower caliber than in the past. I’m certain some of the elite realize how deranged and dangerous this all is, but how many and who? We probably would not like the answer.

                I noticed that when you had the protests after Oct. 7. The big Jewish donors to the schools seemed genuinely shocked. Yeah, yeah, they were pissed that Jews were being thrown into Team Whitey, but they also seemed to have no clue what was going on at the universities.Now that I think of it, when you look at our oligarchs today, they are very different from the oligarchs in the past. The oligarchs of the past made their money in real industries that required dealing with the real world – getting raw materials, transporting the materials and shipping the goods out, big factory with lots of machines and men, unions, etc.The oligarchs were men who deal with the real world. Our new oligarchs – besides being a foreign elite – work in finance, tech, media and other industries where the real world doesn’t impose itself too much. Narrative and numbers are what they deal with.So, yes, today’s oligarchs live in a fantasy world as much as the managerial class.

                    No doubt. The WEF is quite the clown show, but it does reveal this diminished capacity from time to time, especially with panels on transhumanism and immortality achieved through downloading memory/brain activity. To the degree that’s not deranged, it also is infantile and stupid. Although less extreme, Bill Ackman never believed the Ghost of DEI Present would appear at his kids’ yeshiva. More than detachment and arrogance, that reflects a shocking degree of ignorance at the most basic level.As sort of an aside, the oligarchs’ monopolies on finance, tech, and information are slowly receding, and they are in panic. They still are well-positioned enough to reverse course but do not have the skillset and imagination to do so unlike those who oversaw the transition from manufacturing and production, no matter how ill-advised that was.

                        Consider the possibility that no one is in charge. As a wiser man than me noted, virtually all aberrant organizational behavior can be attributed to those eternal human foibles: greed, stupidity, sloth, plain old incompetence. “Virtually” because one can never rule out deliberate malice; of course it happens, but it’s probably rare, and less so at scale (IMO of course). We conspiracy theorists love to believe in some evil genius pulling the strings. For Christians that’d be Satan and his minions. For secularists, it’s the WEF. A few generations ago it was the Bilderbergers and the CFR/Trilateral Commission. When we’re waxing playful, it’s a Bond villain in his hollowed out volcano. Jigger the details as you like, but they all boil down to the same general themes.In some ways, the scariest scenario is that there’s really no one in charge. Over at Sev’s place we often channel the Do Long Bridge scene (fromApocalypse Now) when a soldier is asked where’s the C.O. the newcomer is brusquely told there ain’t no fuckin’ C.O.

                            Lot of sense there. Consider the first moment you look down into your newborn’s face and the terrifying thought hits you, “Crap, I’m like an adult now. I’m supposed to know things. I shoulda studied or something.” Only to (possibly) realize much later that we are all just ad libbing, winging it, making it up as we go.

                            I strongly suspect there are competing elite factions now, so there is merit to your point if that suspicion is right. The disappearance of leftwing, for convenience’s sake, lockstep and coordinated actions has started to pop up now and then. If factions are in constant competition and have given up themodus vivendithat at least provided the illusion of unity, yeah, no one probably is in charge (this assumes once upon a time someone was in charge).

        Somebody is going to have to explain to me why the set-up of the post-Yeltsin era was so bad for everyone. The Russians exported cheap gas and pretty girls, the Euro elite and Ukrainian politicians took their cut, the Russians reinvested the proceeds in London real estate and football clubs, and German industry hummed along. 20 years later, everything is screwed and we’re talking about something as farcical as the “JEF” while we’re on the brink of WW3.

            One word, Cpt Willard:  Greed.  That great big mostly empty spot on the map with untold natural resourceshas always been the big prize for centuries.  Genghis Khan, Napoleon, Hitler, the Neocons all have had/have their designs on the vastness of Russia.  Just imagine the lebensraum for all the tens of millions of third world workers that would be brought in to build and staff this vast playground for the super rich and their managerialtoadies.  The rainbow flag will be hoisted over the Kremlin with great fanfare.  When Russia is finally filled and raped and pillaged, “they” will move on to China and the world will be theirs. That is their dream, that is their mission. The global hegemon is always hungry.

        I dunno, scanning the MSM it’s mostly Trump-Trump-Trump. I have not seen much hand-wringing over Russia. It’s very likely the only people who genuinely care about Ukraine-Russia are managerial retards and neocons.I wonder if Europe and not Washington is driving all this? You know the old line about politics is downstream from culture. Europe for some time time has been downstream from America. When we let something go, Europe is still holding onto it. Like jean jackets.It may take some time before they realize America doesn’t care, so they won’t care. This pertains to all the fads of the past 15 years. The last “refugees welcome” show will be in Germany. The last black man-white woman commercial will be in Britain. The last tranny politician will be in Spain.

                The Grand Canyon has nothing on the chasm between what the public wants and what its putative elected leaders deliver. Mass migration is overwhelmingly opposed in every Western nation, for example. Opinion and voting only matter if the causes and issues align with what the Administrative State wants. Otherwise, the concerns are duly noted and filed away.
A green shoot, perhaps, is how quickly the public turned against the Ukraine insanity, but that is offset by it not making a difference.

                    Imagine the Regime gets in a hot war with Russia and there is no folksy patriotism, and few American flags placed on cars. There’s a lot of resistance to it from both the left and the right. The incoming president doesn’t want it. The media starts splintering, and then you have a missile attack on a carrier or European base and you have maybe 1/5th of the outrage that you’d have seen if it were 2003.
If you’re into the JQ, fellas, then that’s a great time to mainstream it.

                        I suspect a number of false flag attacks to be launched on the homeland to try to gin up support, but given the crisis of competency the managers also would screw those up. Exhibit A is the planted pipe bombs in coordination with the January 6 psy op. Literally everyone realizes the IC/FBI to be responsible.

        The most damning indictment of liberal democracy is the quality of its leadership. The ruling class put up a vegetable and a retard sequentially, and asked us to believe that these were their best they had to offer. Even Trump, for all his extraordinary talents, is a poor judge of character and too easily manipulated by flattery. His chief virtue is that he is not, or was not, part of the ruling class.The liberal order is governed by narratives that are necessary to achieve the necessary consensus among distributed power nodes. Adherence to the narratives is the lingua franca of power. Divergent thinking gets you cast out. Many of the most successful actually believe their own bullshit. That’s how the lemmings go off the cliff.They cannot conceive of failure, even when it’s staring them in the face.

            This is the most dangerous time for the US when Trump takes office. We all know he does not read, and is not interested in history beyond talking about how long the mattress is in the Lincoln Bedroom. He is a 1960s-1990s era American male and will bring that mindset to foreign policy.I see no one on Trump’s national security staff who will be able to keep the “Commies coming over the Rio Grande” whisperers away from Trump, which will trigger and mirror his own experience of being a white dude who lived in a time everyone thought the Cold War would last forever.

                This is a good observation—unfortunately *not* without merit.  My hope is Trump is a reformed/contrite man after the Covid-19 fiasco.  He listened to those  with “credentials” against his better judgement and it lost him re-election.
Trump’s main problem (IMHO) was that he listened to too many people in his first administration and went against his gut instincts.  Given our current trend in this group to analyze and condemn the managerial class, the uniparty and their overlords—perhaps placing all our money on a Trump bet is the best way out of this mess, if possible.

                    Trump has certainly has made some noise by nominating many “disruptors” to key positions. Unfortunately, when Cocaine Mitch said Gaetz was a no go Trump instantly folded. Will things play out like they did in 2016 when all the outsiders he brought with him to Washington in January were gone by April.

        ‘That is the West right now. It is a ship bobbing around, crewed by mediocre men who are terrified at the thought of being in charge. Instead, they huddle together inside a consensus and ruthlessly enforce it.’Right.  The West has a crisis of masculinity in that it’s overtly feminist and anti-masculine.  It devalues and disenfranchises its boys and men, calling that goodness and equality.  Its impetus consists of empowered women plus tractable and inferior men, that infest the political class and the bureaucracy.  All things then founder and deteriorate.Instead of meritorious and proven hierarchic leadership, upon which men and civilization rely, the political class embraces the feminine priority of consensus . . . make sure nobody’s offended . . . men who drift to the middle of the herd where it’s safe.I mean, look at these doods, Macron and Starmer.  They’re rejects amongst men.  Kicked outta the barracks.  Ragdoll globalista frontmen . . . merely bought men.  This Macron dildo married somebody’s grandmother, for God’s sake.  That’s all he could find around?Eunuchs at Jezebel’s courts.  The Way of the Longhouse.

        Look at Nigel Farage in the UK, who is literally running away from a leadership role at a time when a strong man might cause the UK government to fall. Instead, he’s making videos about the Jaguar commercial and muttering like Jordan Peterson about woke going broke again, like a broken record.There doesn’t seem to be anyone willing to step up, for reasons I doubt we’ll live long enough to find out.Meanwhile Trump has surrounded himself with Russophobes like Mike Waltz and Seb Gorka — anyone who thinks the Trump White House will tamp down the insanity is willfully lying to your face. The evidence is right there that nothing will change.

        “The UK has a lot of problems, but it still has some of the best human capital on the planet.”The English are not a numerous people, and yet consistently, even today, they produce amazing writers. The globalists must not be allowed to make the English vanish from the Earth.“How in the world did these two feckless nitwits end up ruling these two once great nations?”They do not rule. They administrate. A Prime Minister is an example of state authority. If an individual is making sovereign decisions, then they are exercising power. If they are carrying out decisions made by others (who and whose policy preferences are never on any ballot) then they are mere administrators. Power lies in the hands of those who have facilitated their ascension and who give them policy direction.When the nations of the West were losing sovereignty to the globalists, individuals in authority were manipulated rather than controlled. That era has passed. Starmer and Macron are political prostitutes. They are not men of power, having never exercised it. They are prostitutes willingly servicing the faction of the globalist cartel that owns their countries.

        Nixey is no Nixon. This is especially idiotic: “Consider the drip-feed: before the annexation of Crimea and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine’s Donbas in 2014, the west refused to provide Ukraine with any military assistance or to sanction Russia meaningfully….” That’s because Ukraine and Russia were at peace before the 2014 Nuland coup.

            It makes sense to the western managerial mind that they should have sanctioned Russia for the thought crime of thinking about annexing Crimea, long before they actually did it. Putting aside for the moment the comedy of this mediocrity still believing, at this late date, in the effectiveness of sanctioning Russia. No, that is too kind to him, and too harsh to true mediocrities.

        His entire life has been about sitting in a room somewhere imagining what life is like outside that room.Original? Regardless, awesome.Politicians and the unironically dubbed “thought leaders” always have been the dutiful puppets of oligarchs. With the collapse of oligarchical intelligence we have gotten the likes of Macron, Starmer, and the even dumber diversity version like Harris and Lammy. Common people may not get the governments they deserve but the oligarchs certainly do. And as an aside, while I hope beyond reason nothing of the sort happens, it almost–almost–would be a joy to see the look on Starmer’s vapid, pig-like face as he is informed something something is inbound and headed straight at No. 10. Of course, we would all either die or be sunk into bitter poverty if such happened, and the footage of his face would never be disseminated, but it’s the thought that counts (as long as it remains hypothetical).

        You had a post last week about how the CIA grooms people like Juan Guaido. The same is true of morons like Starmer and Macron. When the US regime talks about “democracies”, it means compliant quislings like these.
The British forces today are about capable of invading and capturing the Isle of Wight. Maybe that’s too severe — let’s say the Isle of Man. That’s it.

        If you really want to be scared, or reassured, I’m not really sure which, consider the high probability that none of these western “leaders” are actually in control of launching nuclear weapons, and consider who might be. We already know Trump wasn’t. We can be very confident Biden isn’t. I’m willing to wager substantial sums that Starmer and Macron aren’t either. If anybody has a guess for who is, I’m all ears.

            My knowledge of nuclear command and control is pretty much limited to a Tom Clancy novel or two. No matter; it rang true: such power is not in the hands of any one individual. At the very least it’d require the approval of one ? two ? more? Other officials before an attack would commence.Of course there are any number of other rumored systems, like the Soviet’s “Dead Hand” automatic Doomsday program. It’s been rumored the US has something similar. You know, something that would massively retaliate automatically, our subs I presume, in the event of a first strike killing off our leaders.Clearly I’m only conjecturing, but it’d seem a safe bet that at least for the big powers, that the power to launch is not given to any one person.

            The problem with Rome’s concept of a “dictator”—one that they knew and feared at the time—was who that dictator would be. In the first use (that I’m aware of) they found Lucious Quinctius Cincinnatus. He of course was a man of honor and principle and when he no longer needed the power of absolute dictator, returned to his life as a gentleman farmer. In times not long past, our early Republic recognized such men of integrity and celebrated such as an example to the people.
Today, not so much…sigh.

        “In the room the women come and go talking of Michelangelo”One of the thoughts repeatedly echoing in my mind when thinking about the Western press and elites is from Eliot’sPrufrock. To me, this captures the pretentiousness, effeminacy, and general superficiality, and is the general feeling of the comments here.Couple this with impotence and a general sense of etherized unwellness – and you have the modern situation with Russia.

                YES. It’s my favorite. If you haven’t heard him read it:T.S. Eliot Reads: The Love Song of J. Alfred PrufrockHere he reads his close second, and stylistically best, even if I prefer TLSJAP:T.S. Eliot Recites “The Hollow Men”Both were about the early interwar years and the devastation of WWI, but they perfectly describe today. In his words, voice and cadence, Eliot captures the bleakness of modernity–and he likely would be horrified by how right he was. Thank God Eliot didn’t live to see today’s Britain or St. Louis. Hearing him read these poems is a small consolation prize for living in hell but one I gladly take. People understandably cite Orwell and Huxley as prophets, but Eliot and Waugh were much closer to the misery that prevails. The rhythm and bitter word play in Eliot’s masterworks are without peer.

        So far this week we have stories leaking out from Europe that the Brits and French are talking about sending an “expeditionary force” to Ukraine.Because the last time the Brits sent an Expeditionary Force to the Continent it worked out so well. 🤦‍♂️They had to come back four years later with the American Army.All I can think of with the Brits is the old school yard taunt “Oh yeah? You and what army!”Quite literally. What forces can the Brits marshal? A quick Goog says the Royal Army totals 110K. How long would they last in head to head combat?

            This has been going on for a long time.  In 1860 Prussian and Austrian armies were settling a territorial dispute with Denmark.  Britain was up in arms about it.  When Bismarck was asked what he would do if Britain landed troops, he famously replied that he would send the police and have them arrested.

            Do they not know how stupid they sound?In August 1914, the British Expeditionary Force was sent across the Channel to support France. Although a small force compared with the German and French armies, it was to play a role out of all proportion to its numbers. But the cost was huge, and by December 1914 the original force had been almost wiped out.https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/1914-mons-christmas#:~:text=In%20August%201914%2C%20the%20British,had%20been%20almost%20wiped%20out.

        Once upon a time, the captain and the mates of a ship grew so vain of their seamanship, so full of hubris and so impressed with themselves, that they went mad. They turned the ship north and sailed until they met with icebergs and dangerous floes, and they kept sailing north into more and more perilous waters, solely in order to give themselves opportunities to perform ever-more-brilliant feats of seamanship.As the ship reached higher and higher latitudes, the passengers and crew became increasingly uncomfortable. They began quarreling among themselves and complaining of the conditions under which they lived.“Shiver me timbers,” said an able seaman, “if this ain’t the worst voyage I’ve ever been on. The deck is slick with ice; when I’m on lookout the wind cuts through me jacket like a knife; every time I reef the foresail I blamed-near freeze me fingers; and all I get for it is a miserable five shillings a month!”“You think you have it bad!” said a lady passenger. “I can’t sleep at night for the cold. Ladies on this ship don’t get as many blankets as the men. It isn’t fair!”A Mexican sailor chimed in: “¡Chingado! I’m only getting half the wages of the Anglo seamen. We need plenty of food to keep us warm in this climate, and I’m not getting my share; the Anglos get more. And the worst of it is that the mates always give me orders in English instead of Spanish.”“I have more reason to complain than anybody,” said an American Indian sailor. “If the palefaces hadn’t robbed me of my ancestral lands, I wouldn’t even be on this ship, here among the icebergs and arctic winds. I would just be paddling a canoe on a nice, placid lake. I deserve compensation. At the very least, the captain should let me run a crap game so that I can make some money.”The bosun spoke up: “Yesterday the first mate called me a ‘fruit’ just because I suck cocks. I have a right to suck cocks without being called names for it!”It’s not only humans who are mistreated on this ship,” interjected an animal-lover among the passengers, her voice quivering with indignation. “Why, last week I saw the second mate kick the ship’s dog twice!”One of the passengers was a college professor. Wringing his hands he exclaimed,“All this is just awful! It’s immoral! It’s racism, sexism, speciesism, homophobia, and exploitation of the working class! It’s discrimination! We must have social justice: Equal wages for the Mexican sailor, higher wages for all sailors, compensation for the Indian, equal blankets for the ladies, a guaranteed right to suck cocks, and no more kicking the dog!”“Yes, yes!” shouted the passengers. “Aye-aye!” shouted the crew. “It’s discrimination! We have to demand our rights!”The cabin boy cleared his throat.“Ahem. You all have good reasons to complain. But it seems to me that what we really have to do is get this ship turned around and headed back south, because if we keep going north we’re sure to be wrecked sooner or later, and then your wages, your blankets, and your right to suck cocks won’t do you any good, because we’ll all drown.”But no one paid any attention to him, because he was only the cabin boy.The captain and the mates, from their station on the poop deck, had been watching and listening. Now they smiled and winked at one another, and at a gesture from the captain the third mate came down from the poop deck, sauntered over to where the passengers and crew were gathered, and shouldered his way in amongst them. He put a very serious expression on his face and spoke thusly:“We officers have to admit that some really inexcusable things have been happening on this ship. We hadn’t realized how bad the situation was until we heard your complaints. We are men of good will and want to do right by you. But — well — the captain is rather conservative and set in his ways, and may have to be prodded a bit before he’ll make any substantial changes. My personal opinion is that if you protest vigorously — but always peacefully and without violating any of the ship’s rules — you would shake the captain out of his inertia and force him to address the problems of which you so justly complain.”Having said this, the third mate headed back toward the poop deck. As he went, the passengers and crew called after him, “Moderate! Reformer! Goody-liberal! Captain’s stooge!” But they nevertheless did as he said. They gathered in a body before the poop deck, shouted insults at the officers, and demanded their rights: “I want higher wages and better working conditions,” cried the able seaman. “Equal blankets for women,” cried the lady passenger. “I want to receive my orders in Spanish,” cried the Mexican sailor. “I want the right to run a crap game,” cried the Indian sailor. “I don’t want to be called a fruit,” cried the bosun. “No more kicking the dog,” cried the animal lover. “Revolution now,” cried the professor.The captain and the mates huddled together and conferred for several minutes, winking, nodding and smiling at one another all the while. Then the captain stepped to the front of the poop deck and, with a great show of benevolence, announced that the able seaman’s wages would be raised to six shillings a month; the Mexican sailor’s wages would be raised to two-thirds the wages of an Anglo seaman, and the order to reef the foresail would be given in Spanish; lady passengers would receive one more blanket; the Indian sailor would be allowed to run a crap game on Saturday nights; the bosun wouldn’t be called a fruit as long as he kept his cocksucking strictly private; and the dog wouldn’t be kicked unless he did something really naughty, such as stealing food from the galley.The passengers and crew celebrated these concessions as a great victory, but the next morning, they were again feeling dissatisfied.“Six shillings a month is a pittance, and I still freeze me fingers when I reef the foresail,” grumbled the able seaman. “I’m still not getting the same wages as the Anglos, or enough food for this climate,” said the Mexican sailor. “We women still don’t have enough blankets to keep us warm,” said the lady passenger. The other crewmen and passengers voiced similar complaints, and the professor egged them on.When they were done, the cabin boy spoke up — louder this time so that the others could not easily ignore him:“It’s really terrible that the dog gets kicked for stealing a bit of bread from the galley, and that women don’t have equal blankets, and that the able seaman gets his fingers frozen; and I don’t see why the bosun shouldn’t suck cocks if he wants to. But look how thick the icebergs are now, and how the wind blows harder and harder! We’ve got to turn this ship back toward the south, because if we keep going north we’ll be wrecked and drowned.”“Oh yes,” said the bosun, “It’s just so awful that we keep heading north. But why should I have to keep cocksucking in the closet? Why should I be called a fruit? Ain’t I as good as everyone else?”“Sailing north is terrible,” said the lady passenger. “But don’t you see? That’s exactly why women need more blankets to keep them warm. I demand equal blankets for women now!”“It’s quite true,” said the professor, “that sailing to the north imposes great hardships on all of us. But changing course toward the south would be unrealistic. You can’t turn back the clock. We must find a mature way of dealing with the situation.”“Look,” said the cabin boy, “If we let those four madmen up on the poop deck have their way, we’ll all be drowned. If we ever get the ship out of danger, then we can worry about working conditions, blankets for women, and the right to suck cocks. But first we’ve got to get this vessel turned around. If a few of us get together, make a plan, and show some courage, we can save ourselves. It wouldn’t take many of us — six or eight would do. We could charge the poop, chuck those lunatics overboard, and turn the ship to the south.”The professor elevated his nose and said sternly, “I don’t believe in violence. It’s immoral.”“It’s unethical ever to use violence,” said the bosun.“I’m terrified of violence,” said the lady passenger.The captain and the mates had been watching and listening all the while. At a signal from the captain, the third mate stepped down to the main deck. He went about among the passengers and crew, telling them that there were still many problems on the ship.“We have made much progress,” he said, “But much remains to be done. Working conditions for the able seaman are still hard, the Mexican still isn’t getting the same wages as the Anglos, the women still don’t have quite as many blankets as the men, the Indian’s Saturday-night crap game is a paltry compensation for his lost lands, it’s unfair to the bosun that he has to keep his cocksucking in the closet, and the dog still gets kicked at times.“I think the captain needs to be prodded again. It would help if you all would put on another protest — as long as it remains nonviolent.”As the third mate walked back toward the stern, the passengers and the crew shouted insults after him, but they nevertheless did what he said and gathered in front of the poop deck for another protest. They ranted and raved and brandished their fists, and they even threw a rotten egg at the captain (which he skillfully dodged).After hearing their complaints, the captain and the mates huddled for a conference, during which they winked and grinned broadly at one another. Then the captain stepped to the front of the poop deck and announced that the able seaman would be given gloves to keep his fingers warm, the Mexican sailor would receive wages equal to three-fourths the wages of an Anglo seaman, the women would receive yet another blanket, the Indian sailor could run a crap game on Saturday and Sunday nights, the bosun would be allowed to suck cocks publicly after dark, and no one could kick the dog without special permission from the captain.The passengers and crew were ecstatic over this great revolutionary victory, but by the next morning they were again feeling dissatisfied and began grumbling about the same old hardships.The cabin boy this time was getting angry.“You damn fools!” he shouted. “Don’t you see what the captain and the mates are doing? They’re keeping you occupied with your trivial grievances about blankets and wages and the dog being kicked so that you won’t think about what is really wrong with this ship — that it’s getting farther and farther to the north and we’re all going to be drowned. If just a few of you would come to your senses, get together, and charge the poop deck, we could turn this ship around and save ourselves. But all you do is whine about petty little issues like working conditions and crap games and the right to suck cocks.”The passengers and the crew were incensed.“Petty!!” cried the Mexican, “Do you think it’s reasonable that I get only three-fourths the wages of an Anglo sailor? Is that petty?”“How can you call my grievance trivial? shouted the bosun. “Don’t you know how humiliating it is to be called a fruit?”“Kicking the dog is not a ‘petty little issue!’” screamed the animal-lover. “It’s heartless, cruel, and brutal!”“Alright then,” answered the cabin boy. “These issues are not petty and trivial. Kicking the dog is cruel and brutal and it is humiliating to be called a fruit. But in comparison to our real problem — in comparison to the fact that the ship is still heading north — your grievances are petty and trivial, because if we don’t get this ship turned around soon, we’re all going to drown.”“Fascist!” said the professor.“Counterrevolutionary!” said the lady passenger. And all of the passengers and crew chimed in one after another, calling the cabin boy a fascist and a counterrevolutionary. They pushed him away and went back to grumbling about wages, and about blankets for women, and about the right to suck cocks, and about how the dog was treated. The ship kept sailing north, and after a while it was crushed between two icebergs and everyone drowned.

        Have you ever worked someplace that was just a dysfunctional mess and watched how people reacted when a competent leader was inbound?They tend to freak out because for years they’ve just done whatever with no accountability.  Now the organization is broke, sales are down, market share is collapsing and nobody seems to care.The ship has a crew.  They aren’t debating the need for a captain.  A new captain has been assigned to them, and that means accountability is coming.As Tucker put it before the election, “Dad is coming home.  And he’s PISSED!”Hence all the talk about Trump-proofing the Ukraine debacle.

        “Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron are ridiculous people who have landed in these positions due to the collapse of their respective political classes.”
It seems as though Europeans suffer from a lot of delusions. I think many of them in positions of power secretly fantasize about being royalty. They consider themselves players on the world stage but in reality, they are small ball politicians like what you would find in any state legislature.

        From Clinton on, until Trump, all the presidents have been hollow men;  None had any real world experience beyond politics.  None have ever had to pay a mortgage, much  lead a platoon.
Not that I have much use for generals and admirals, either.  By the time they get a star, they have been living in the military cocoon so long they have no idea how the world outside the cocoon functions.  (I recall a four star advocating for more Head Start.  Brilliant, sir!).

        Friedman was paid to, “predict”, the next century. The first stop was to easily manhandle Russia via a conflict in the Ukraine. At the same time the West would shore up its GDP by paying aliens to invade the territories of the Empire and its Occidental satraps. GDP is everything and so it would solve all of the problems presented to the Empire.China wouldn’t be a problem in the least. China’s coastal elites are international and closer and happy to be closer to the post-Western coastal/cosmopolitan elites. It was a happy alliance without a single possible crack or fissure. There would be squabbles until Japan emerged as a space power and Poland emerged as a land power.Blah blah blah blah blah. Of course the grand ending for the space dominating Colossus was that after fighting all over the globe to put it under its thumb, Mexico would arise as the rival and it would have a population of loyalists that dominated as the major ethnic group along the vast interior of the country. Yeah! Dominate the globe to have to take back the territory you forfeited along the way. Good idea.The book ends with a question mark around that conflict in 1885.WHAT!?!? The very first part of it went wrong and the Levantine frontier is under seige after the Caucases frontier was abandoned in a calamity?!?!We must quadruple down! We must at all costs stick to the plan. We paid good money for that, “prediction”, goddamn it all and we are going to see it through at any cost. That is how we get our money back.These guys are a joke.

        This whole thing shows why deterrence and mutually asssured destruction isn’t foolproof. The reason the regime is trying to provoke Russia isn’t because they want to destroy civilization in a nuclear holocaust, but they’ve concluded that Putin also is unwilling to destroy the world so they correctly believe that as long as they don’t fire a nuke then they can do anything else including an invasion of Russia.  Putin is partially to blame for this, he keeps drawing red lines which our shithead leaders proceed to cross, then his response is always “ooh lookie what I can do with this unarmed missile test”, essentially a bluff charge.

        as painful as it would be, what would be the primary targets of a Russian strike?  the cities.   no loss there as they are purely parasitical at this point.  the forest flourishes after a fire.  bigger picture; the population pressure on the world is basically eliminated.  in Darwinian terms, a nuke war is a huge plus for the planet, and mankind.  the quality of life shot up for the survivors of the Black Plaque for the very same reasons.

            Africa and the Global South would be mostly, or perhaps even entirely spared, while White nations would be devastated, the white population dramatically diminished. Over time probably this would lead to starvation in Africa, since they are incapable of surviving at current population levels without food imports.

                Yes, while Europe and N. America is smoldering, the Indians and Chinese will begin vying for world dominance. The Chinese will win, but the Indians will try and rebuild the West in their image, to better counter the Chinese.
Arabs/Muslims will play the two off each other, and try and keep their civilizations alive without their fancy condos in NYC/London and their Swiss financial havens.
Africa will be Africa, no matter what.

                There’s a Heinlein book about that.  A nuclear war destroys the northern hemisphere.  Through the magic of sci-fi the hero wakes up in the distant future run by a technologically super advanced southern hemispheric people – blacks – who keep whites as slaves (and food, iirc)
I just remembered the name: Farnham’s Freehold.  Read it a long time ago.  It has a “Wakanda” problem in the plot, though.

                Methinks you are ignoring the untoward effects of (possibly) a total collapse in world trade, the value of the debt/credit financial systems, the shipment of raw materials or finished goods, etc. A global system breakdown would claim victims far in excess of a (relatively) limited nuclear war.

            “…the quality of life shot up for the survivors of the Black Plaque for the very same reasons.”Yes, but that was then—this is now.  Back in Medieval times, everyone lived off of the land at subsistence level.  TheMalthusian theory of population would keep the numbers at what the land could support.  The people went away, but the land did not, hence a rebound.We have a technological society and the cities contain the bulk of the technological, high IQ caste.  How many get killed off will be the key to what the immediate future will look like.  We live way in excess of what a simple agrarian society can maintain.  Knowledge of course will not be lost as Ayn Rand postulated in “Anthem”, but what is knowledge without the human capital to make use of it?
