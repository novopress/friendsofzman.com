        It’s not fear and resentment; it’s frustration and rage.

        Having once been a family member of an old NY/NE elite family and its circle, and having been schooled among them earlier, I can state without hesitation that these folks hold the “common” folk in profound contempt. Be polite to them, appear respectful and once they’re out of sight have a good laugh and forget they ever existed; they’re interchangeable after all.They are all still ultra-pc, of course. I never was, never will be.Having had some skill in the past at being able to make out “Mene Mene…” when I see it on a particular wall, I thus decided to emigrate from the US long ago. I now live in a tiny rural village with wonderful views, a mild climate and a refreshing air of tranquility and small town security. I’m the immigrant, along with my son, both of us bilingual, but he also married a host country national and while I, an older person, will always be seen as “foreign”, we’ve assimilated to a large degree. We are accepted far more and treated far better than folks who move here from the capital city of this country.The article is spot on. I’ve seen it in various countries in which I’ve lived: the elite will be more open to a foreigner than to a fellow citizen perceived as “not our kind, deary”. It’s mildly understandable, that point of view, but very limiting and in the final account possibly dangerous as well.

        In an October poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University, 68 percent agreed with the proposition that “a big problem this country has is being politically correct.”
It was a sentiment felt strongly across the political spectrum, by 62 percent of Democrats, 68 percent of independents and 81 percent of Republicans. Among whites, 72 percent said they felt that way, but so did 61 percent of nonwhites.
“People feel tremendous cultural condescension directed at them,” and that their values are being “smirked at, laughed at” by the political and media elite, said GOP strategist Steve Schmidt.

Cultural condescension.

        On the topic of ‘fear and resentment” and the fact that the elite and its hangers-on have no concept of the ordinary world it is always fun when they encounter what the non-elites think.Some years ago, before mass immigration even appeared on the horizon, there was an attempt by the lefty-loving — though commercially-funded — UK TV channel known as Channel 4 to ensure that ordinary people should be shown to embrace what the lefties love. The plan was a one-off programme (sorry, UK-English spelling) where a group of everyday people — people who might support charitable donations to those in need — would listen to the sob stories of hopeful asylum seekers from warmer countries and declare whether they should or should not be let in to the UK.The presenters made every effort of pull at the collective heart strings to make their case, and in response the peasant ‘panel’ gave their verdict swiftly.As far I can recall it was always a “no” to allowing them in to the UK.

        I’m looking more to 1860 than 1916, myself.  We saw a very similar phenomenon in the run up to the Civil War.  One of the reasons most Northerners thought the South wouldn’t secede (or fight if it left, or collapse quickly if it fought) was that there was no real “popular” government in the South — the franchise in places like South Carolina was so restricted that, even if you didn’ttechnicallyhave to be a slaveholder to qualify, that’s almost what it amounted to.  So when Northerners spoke of the “Slave Power Conspiracy,” they really weren’t kidding — the South really did seem to be about 300 families running things for their own direct personal benefit, with the voices of the rabble completely excluded.The Confederacy, Northerners assumed, would be all chiefs and no Indians, because that’s how Southern politics had worked from colonial times.  And Southerners knew it — since they were the ones who set up the system in the first place — and not even they could be so blind to their position as to….…well, we know how that one worked out.  Now, I’mnotsaying that the current political class can count on Confederate levels of support should they decide to suicidally pursue their own interests to the bitter end once again.  I doubt too many folks are willing to enlist for Rich Lowry.  The point is that every American revolution has been a revolt of the elites against the masses.  It won’t be Tea Party terrorists shooting up federal land in Oregon; it’ll be President Hillary Rubio ordering up drone strikes on peaceful rallies, with NRO out there waving the flag for law and order.

        I’m reading that the Cleveland Plain Dealer closed, for the first time,  the comment sections on articles “reporting” on the case of the twelve year old tyke shot by cops after spending his morning waving a pellet gun at white people. The editors explained that these articles were “magnets” for haters and made rational discussion impossible. They are unable to conceive that the enormous response in  comments are both honest and representative feedback. But they are obviously not interested in gaining paying customers or making a profit. They have principles and they like to sit on them.I even see this phenomena at the Yahoo homepage. The propaganda is relentless but the comments are hilarious.Progressives are nothing if not dedicated to propaganda and manipulation. We see their comment trolls, paid and unpaid, all over the net. But if they are getting overwhelmed at Yahoo, that’s encouraging.BTW, Fangraphs, a good baseball site, has just gone over to registration. Comments were never an issue there in my experience. I do not doubt that they are still stinging from the avalanche that hit them after their most ridiculous posts–why are there not more homosexuals in baseball and the like–but the capper was why are there no Muslims in baseball (and what can we do about it). That thing ran to 200 comments in no time before comments disappeared, the only time this has ever happened. They were absolutely hilarious, a real treasure.Tocqueville–The evil which one suffers patently as inevitable seems insupportable as soon as he conceives the idea of escape from it.
