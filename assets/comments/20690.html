        I‚Äôm really blackpilled right now. I saw on the local network yesterday that the rich white bitches in my neighborhood are trying to destroy a twenty-year-old restaurant for insufficient wokeness. It‚Äôs the kind of restaurant that has supported the community, green spaces, sports events things like that for 20 years and they are trying to destroy while turning a blind eye to the fact that they are sending their pink children out to be hunted like animals.  I hate these women

                    These women would literally (and I truly mean literally, not using the word as a faux exclamation point like most do) turn their blond-haired, blue-eyed daughters over to the black mob if they thought it would absolve them of their implicit racism.  Half of these kids will be destroyed by their aberrant parents.  Perhaps a few will accept reality.  I hope they damn their parents‚Äô memories for eternity.

                        Think of the liberal white mom, never so proud as when she can tell the other wine moms about her gay son, or her daughter dating black guys.They are truly one of the two primary sources of the problem.

            Like this fetid pile of rancid monkey vomit.https://www.zerohedge.com/political/uk-police-investigate-museum-curator-suggesting-rioters-destroy-racist-statues-chemicalsAn actual Museum curator advising how to destroy bronze statues to glorify her own Narcissism. She has a non job surrounded by the output of countless skilled craftsmen through history and her only thought is fingering herself over how wet she will feel over their destruction.At some point I believe violence will be the only restraining factor in the insanity.

                    It is why I think we need to focus on punishing them for their wickedness above all else. I understand the other tribes jockeying for power and spoils. This is the nature of things.But those of Our People that betray their own‚Ä¶ Ashes in their mouths. They should be Our first and foremost focus to destroy in whatever legal means we have.

                    Whitney,You care because you care about your Our people and children. It breaks your heart to see Our kids abused, mislead and maligned. It angers you to see Ours systematically toppled by the other tribes. It enrages you to see white parents betray their own children.For whatever reason you don‚Äôt have children of your own, I appreciate your love of Our People and your fervent desire, to fight back for Ours endears you to me as truly motherly.Bless you

            I live in the beating heart of Karenland. Watching them confirms my belief that they are women who are, in a way, lost. For thousands of years, middle-aged women found self-worth in having a family, creating a community (serving their tribe) and being good members of their church (serving God).The Karens, even the ones with children, have either partially or completely lost all three. Karens have been taught that having children stopped them from having a wonderful, fulfilling career of importance. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times, I‚Äôve heard a Karen tell her kid, ‚ÄúI gave up my career for you, and this is how you act.‚ÄùKarens truly believe that they sacrificed something huge to have kids.White community has completely collapsed, while churches seem to have gone all-in on the narrative. As a result, Karen types look to find self-worth by serving the only tribe and church that they know.To them, they are building up and improving their community and being ever so righteous, even more righteous than that other Karen down the street. (Middle-aged white women have been competing with each other over who is more righteous since the dawn of our people.)The Karens are simply looking to do what they‚Äôve always done, but that desire has been turned against them. And that‚Äôs where white men come into the equation. We don‚Äôt offer them a community. We‚Äôve abandoned that role to TPTB. Granted, we were tricked, but come on, it wasn‚Äôt that good of a con.White women abandoned white men because we lost control of community. Karens are annoying as hell, but they‚Äôve always been annoying. It‚Äôs just that before, they were being annoying in building our communities and pushing our agenda.

                There‚Äôs this website by the name of nextdoor ‚Äì I‚Äôm sure most have heard of it.  I check it out off and on just to see what‚Äôs up in da hood.  Well, it‚Äôs totally populated by karens, especially with this kung fru nonsense.  Mostly bitching about people not wearing masks in order to save humanity.  I want to weigh in sometimes but it just isn‚Äôt worth it.  However something came up a couple of days ago where I just couldn‚Äôt resist.  We‚Äôve had a fairly large wild fire in the mountains around town and of course the local media has been hyping it up big time ‚Äì like its never happened before.  Some potential evacuations were announced ‚Äì mostly for a couple of areas butt up against the monta√±a and you wouldn‚Äôt have believed all the pearl clutching and vaporing.  Hilarious.

                Whitney-Citizen-Penitent‚ÄîAm hearing a theme that men should have seen women going bad and should have squashed the bad behavior. Stop the your-fault thinking. You couldn‚Äôt have stopped this. Importantly, you could not have recognized this decline in women. These are much bigger cycles that have repeated throughout history. First, remember the cycle that produced Aristophanes‚Äô The Assemblywoman in 391 BC.Second, Indian people in the U.S. experienced women gone bad cycles, i.e. the Hopis. The Hopi people are not ‚ÄúThe Hopis‚Äù a uni-tribe of people, but are many different bands of people that migrated to 1st-2nd-3rd mesas n/w of Flagstaff Arizona, migrating from the collapse of the great Chaco culture late 13th century, the migrating different bands/tribes of people leaving the Colorado Plateau country during the 14th century, migrating bands leaving Spanish conquered pueblo country in New Mexico 17th century, all at different times arriving in the Mesa country in Northern Arizona.The Hopi‚Äôs teaching stories from deep history tell of periods of their history when the people go corrupt. Women figure centrally in all Hopi narratives of destruction either as objects of desire who lead men to corruption, or as the focus of violence between men from opposing villages. Women in the eastern pueblos were cordoned off from most aspects of the Katsinam religion, and women were excluded from the most powerful aspects of ceremonial life. Hopi history and teachings are a series of villages gone corrupt in which often the tribal head sought complete destruction of his village for there was no way to redeem his people.Awat‚Äôovi, the easternmost pueblo on Antelope Mesa, had stood for centuries as the eastern gateway to the whole Hopi landscape. In the Autumn of 1700, it fell easily to an early dawn assault, not by traditional enemies such as the Utes or Navajos, but to a combined force of Hopis from neighboring villages. The leader of Awat‚Äôovi opened the gate to allow them entry and complete destruction of the village. Each time the cycle would run into corruption, the turn from the good Katsinam to sorcery, instead of men gathering in kivas to examine the meaning of life, men and women would use the kivas for gambling and other. Married women abandoned their husbands for the company of other men. Young women rather than displaying traditional modesty, would dance in the kivas at night then seek out men. When the Katsinam teachings were discarded, the destruction of the village was sought, usually by the ‚Äúmedicine‚Äù head of the village. Wholesale obliteration rather than individual persecution, in the storm that washes away the corruption and brings a fresh dawn of renewal.I hope I am wrong, yet until we reach a tipping point in the corruption cycle and women experience broken stuff, fear and hunger will they return humbly to you.This is not new in history nor is it your doing or your failings as men. You are within the cycle and the rare few that can step away to observe. In our society, the standard bearers are women; in Hopi, the standard bearers are men. Few can recognize the larger dynamics that create decline.

                    Range,Always a pleasure to hear from you, ma‚Äôam. Oh, I agree‚Ä¶ things are cyclical and reoccurring in descents‚Ä¶ nor do I think it is our fault. My little girl is a proper Lady. I, most others here, lay the blame for Our women on the trifecta: women‚Äôs suffrage, two societally devastating world wars, and the little hat tribe.For now, Ostei is right. As long as this democracy shambles along at 52% women and TPTB in the ruling class and the media can peddle their division proxy wars then we are at an impasse. Cataclysmic societal collapse, the mockery of democracy worsening, and the rulers losing the ability to exercise power and control‚Ä¶ all bets are off.Karens beware.

                    Range,Good points. History is a story of cycles, and women gaining political power shows up again and again, always as a sign of a decaying society.I do believe that all of us, and not just the Karens, will need to experience some pain before we wake up. Right now, it‚Äôs simply too easy to go with the flow.

        Fifteen years ago or so (maybe more) I was in a good white boutique eatery where a young black male had come in to order a sandwich to go. He didn‚Äôt like something about the sandwich (I think the guacamole) and he chewed out this lanky white hipster ‚Äúsandwich artist‚Äù with a goatee for like ten minutes. The good white smiled the whole time and finally asked the black kid, ‚ÄúWhat can I do to make you happy?‚Äù The black kid said, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt make me happy.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúaware‚Äù back then, but I remember thinking that this social arrangement was not going to work, even then. It‚Äôs profitable for the talented tenth/hustler class, people like Ta Nehisi Coates, to keep the current arrangement going, and the usual suspects enjoy it as a way to harass normal whites and decimate their social and political (and economic) capital, but I don‚Äôt think anyone else wants it. Included most black people. So how do we stop this crap?

                The main thing that destroyed the black community is what destroyed America more generally. I know a mainstream economist who constantly points out that segregation gave black businesses captive markets that basically worked to subsidize black infrastructure. Serious cops allowed to do their jobs would also keep the black crabs at the bottom of the bucket from tearing blacks actually trying to ascend limb from limb as they tried to do better. Big box stores and online retailers will benefit from the riots just as much as they benefited from the lock-downs. It‚Äôs almost as if it was intentional. Maybe I should stop scoffing at Alex Jones.

                I happened to see a Martin Lawrence movie ‚ÄúWelcome Home Roscoe Jenkins‚Äù a few years ago at a family member‚Äôs house.It‚Äôs a redemption arc story about a well-to-do black man needing to find his roots and humility by returning to his hometown in the South.It‚Äôs a black Mayberry. No crime, no drugs, and everyone in town is black and doing well. Sure it‚Äôs full of blackity-black conversation and the only major white character is a bimbo girl that serves only to be ridiculed and humiliated as a sex partner for one of the black men. All in all it is a black paradise.What struck me as ridiculous and profoundly sad is that despite no prohibition against them building themselves such a town, or even having the financial capital to do so‚Ä¶ there is not one town in America like that. Not one. Sure there are black neighborhoods and certainly in the South small hamlets entirely full blacks but not one where violence, drugs, poverty, illegitimacy, and crime are not a daily presence.This nice black town could only be created in the fever dream of a Hollywood studio. I certainly don‚Äôt hate black people but the stunning reality that they dont want to be with us, and make our lives exponentially harder, and yet cannot create even a single decent town themselves‚Ä¶ is jarring.

                    This is what galls them.  They know they cannot make an all black town work. There is not enough of them in any particular area and even if there was, it would revert back to the mean.  The funny thing is, what is conveyed in that movie, based on what you are saying, is not what they want.  They don‚Äôt want a town that is functionally white, just with darker skin.They want a town which is free of all of the ills of black culture while maintaining a black vibe and black culture. That is absolutely impossible. They know it and it eats them up. It is also why despite the calls of black segregation, the moment whites started agreeing, they would begin calling them white supremacists.

                        Exactly.  Blacks are Blacks worse problem‚Äînot Whites.  They know this deep down, but can not accept such.  Therefore the alternative is to blame something else for their predicament.  In their case, White racism.  This will never change until they separate from the current society and perhaps are no longer reminded daily of their societal shortcomings as compared to Whites.

                        Good points. If freedom of association were allowed, people could separate or mix as they (instead of the government planners) saw fit? Want to live in an all-white (or Black) neighborhood? No probem; the town (or board of directors) would have the legal power to enforce just that. Want to allow anyone to live in your town? OK. Want to keep dangerous thugs out (no matter their color)? That should be allowed too.

                    Thomas Sowell frequently states that from the 20s to the 50s black incomes rose at a faster rate than they did post civil rights.

Obviously this is cherry picked data and he ignores the reality of diminishing returns. But there is a reason they called it the happy days.

            How do we stop this crap? Genocide would be morally wrong. Separation would be ideal; but I wouldn‚Äôt hold my breath hoping for widespread de jure apartheid. (Though nothing prevents you from striving to achieve personal de facto apartheid.  Just stay away from big cities or much of the South.)So, since they hate you already; just tell blacks who harangue you to STFU. Sadly, as Zman points out, merely refusing to care, to fail to demonstrate that you care deeply with words (BLM) and deeds (kneeling), will have the Goodwhites firing you from your job and making you a social pariah. First, get your own house squared away. Save diligenty in order to have F-You money and find some (it‚Äôll be only a few) true friends who are also fed up with the black black blackety black.

                        This is long, my apologies.  I get your point.  Blacks are not innocent players in most of this, but the goodwhites and their allies are stupid followers that fall for emotional manipulation, and who are, in turn, under the sway of their mostly white and (((‚Äúwhite‚Äù))) manipulators. Those manipulators are truly evil people, who thrive on bedlam and stir the pot to get everyone at each other‚Äôs throats. The manipulators are hiding behind the goodwhites, who are in turn hiding behind the blacks, each urging on the people standing in front of them.  If it wasn‚Äôt blacks, it would be something else.  In my experience, getting ourselves completely away from it and letting them fight it out with each other (because the way they are being all jacked up to be angry, means they have to take it out on someone close by) is the only answer that makes any sense.  The sad thing is that openly expressing appropriate anger about it, on our side, simply feeds into the chaos that the manipulators want to have happen, the chaos that feeds their agenda.  Standing aside and letting them have at each other is one of the better of a bad set of choices, and there isn‚Äôt much satisfaction in it.  But we owe it to ourselves, and our own, to take care of ourselves.There is a video going around right now, where a bunch of Miami cops are taking people down in the street and facing off with other low lifes.  It is so easy to root for those cops and wish they could bash a hundred of those people, instead of one or two.  That‚Äôs just falling into the emotional trap.  We have to be stone cold sober about all of this.  Part of it is recognizing that, in part, a bunch of blacks and goodwhite dupes are being played, big time.  There are too many of them, the poison runs too deep in their souls, and all we would do, if we are not careful, is tangle ourselves up with a few of them.  We would get our skulls busted and lives ruined because we stepped into the fray, where both the crowd and the authorities would turn on us for vengeance.  We have to step away, and remember, too, that blackity-black is, in part, a shitshow game that non-blacks are playing on us and our families.  Donating to BLM goes directly to the Democrat Party so a bunch of old whites can pay to get themselves re-elected, do the bidding of their masters, and skim a bunch of gibs for themselves.  Blacks are just a pawn in that game.  Sorry, didn‚Äôt mean to rant, but all this is something I try to remind myself of, every day.  It‚Äôs so hard not to fly off and say or do something stupid.  Our culture doesn‚Äôt need to be this way.  We are all being played, and there isn‚Äôt much we can do about it right now.

                            So, Blacks blame whites and whites should blame the ((( manipulators)))  Maybe they all should look in the mirror. Its all a sympton  of western decline. How come english would not protect their women and girls from rape and that from rape from outsiders??  Protecting your women is an instinct. You don‚Äôt outlearn it in some Frankfurt  school . You either have it or you dont. Jared Tailor says ‚Äù Its not that the Jew is  strong, it‚Äôs that white man is  week.Welfare is not only funneling  imoney to Blacks. How many Whites work in this system and how much money goes for their salaries?  How much money is  stolen? It,s hard to look in the mirror.

        At one of the many consciousness-raising sessions I was forced to attend back in my ivory tower days, I took the angry lesbian facilitator‚Äôs advice and began exploring Black social media (to ‚Äúeducate myself,‚Äù of course, since we had all day to kill there in the lecture hall). I can‚Äôt claim it‚Äôs exhaustive, but since this was a *long* struggle session, I did get a lot of exploring done.I observed that Blacks live in a world totally devoid of personal agency. They believe in bizarre conspiracy theories. They think slaveholders skinned their slaves to make shoes. They think the classic ‚Äúpants around the ankles‚Äù look of the 1990s gangsta comes from a practice called ‚Äúbuck breaking,‚Äù in which slaveholders raped their field hands to show ‚Äôem who‚Äôs boss. 4G cell phone towers cause cancer (I suppose we‚Äôre up to 5G now, and yes, the fact that all these posts were undoubtedly made on smartphones completely escaped them). They‚Äôre fervent believers in astrology (yes, really). And, of course, any and every ‚Äú___ was really African‚Äù nonsense ‚Äî Plato, Jesus, Colonel Sanders, you name him.Conspicuously absent: Any notion that one should get a job, or an education (other than ‚Äúeducate yo self‚Äù about whatever bizarre conspiracy they were posting). Most strikingly, no sense of the passage of time ‚Äî them getting upset about slavery is, of course, like my Paddy ass getting upset about the Potato Famine‚Ä¶ well, ok, bad analogy (the Irish being the Diversity of Europe, of course), but you get my point. Their world is simply tangential to ours, with no entry points I could figure out.

            I read a piece on some guy who lived in Africa for quite a while and the thing he brought up quite a lot was this lack of a sense of time in Africa. He pointed out they seem to have no sense of future or the past except in a vague manner.The other thing he found weird is that no one seemed to have any self directed hobbies during their spare time.

                    clock time is not ‚Äútime‚Äùthere are various forms of time.When people refer to time, it has a different meaning than mere clock time.  When people speak of Africans and their concept of time it is in addition to their lack of adherence to clock time.  Their whole idea of reflections and reminiscences are different.  It‚Äôs kind of bizarre when you deal with blacks and figure this out.   What this must imply is that their memories work differently, which seems impossible to some.  My guess is that most whites would reject that concept that different people have different ways of processing their memories.  But we know it‚Äôs true even among our own kind.

                        No, dude, time is time. How it is measured is different according to units (e.g. seconds, minutes, days, years, decades, etc) and according to what purposes and tool of measurement you might be using (like a watch or a calendar). For all practical purposes it doesn‚Äôt change.‚ÄúConcept of time‚Äù and ‚Äúadherence to time‚Äù are not exclusive to one another ‚Äì ‚Äúconcept‚Äù still requires people to follow the same day/night cycle (I‚Äôm a night person, but most people aren‚Äôt, ergo I need to adjust my schedule to operate in the daytime). ‚ÄúAdherence‚Äù is just a mater of showing up where you need to be when you planned to be there (ever been stood up on a date? broad just ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to show up).The rest of your comment makes no sense relative to my original post, but it is true everyone‚Äôs brains work differently.

                This is known as ‚Äúcolored people time‚Äù or ‚ÄúCP time‚Äù for short.https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=CP%20TimeIt explains why ebonics and many indigenous African languages have only the present tense and lack the past and future tenses. ‚ÄúHe be chillin&#x27;‚Äù = ‚ÄúHe relaxed around the house yesterday instead of completing the chores his wife asked of him.‚ÄùOf course, if one lacks the past tense, every supposed injustice that a white person understands as having occurred in the past every black person will see as still existing today. And if one lacks the future tense, it‚Äôs no surprise if the person has high time preference and lacks the ability to delay gratification.If there is no conception of the past nor an ability to plan for tomorrow, everything turns into living for the moment. Maybe this is why Kunstler has always placed such a high emphasis on teaching blacks proper English instead of excusing their Ebonics as whites tend to do these days ‚Äì proper English allows one to learn to let go of ‚Äúbeefs‚Äù (the past) and to delay gratification (the future).

                    I had not made the connection that without a time oriented mind states the past events are actually mentally constructed as happening now so any past grievance is always now even if it no longer exists.It must lead to a semi-hallucinatory mind state where the nonexistent and real are overlayed on top of each other. Must be pretty confusing to live in that jumble.Reminds me of the schizophrenia descriptions of not having a sense of time in any ordered way. Which creates huge psychosis pressures.

                        To be fair, blacks‚Äô lack of the past tense isn‚Äôt just expressed in violence against whites, but in violence against each other and against all other races too.When a black says ‚Äúthey be beefin&#x27;‚Äù, that could very well mean a falling-out between two black people that occurred ten years ago, yet if those two people were to bump into each other today the old resentments and arguments would be just as fresh as they were ten years ago.The lack of a past tense explains the high black-on-black homicide rates, for example: a good proportion are not drug or gang-related as one might think, but rather killings over mundane arguments and slights that simmer for decades. This is why ghetto killings tend to ricochet between different matriarchal clans for years and why a black funeral is just as likely to raise fresh gunfire as the original gunfire that led to the funeral: the ‚Äúbeef‚Äù is never quashed, but lingers forever in the present, seamlessly transmitted from black person to black person as one after another is killed. But even then, they never die: their coffins continue to bounce with life!

                Hobbies?  What are hobbies, but exercises for the mind.  Low level IQ types live low level existences.  A lion in the jungle has no hobbies.  It eats its fill, then lays about conserving energy until it gets hungry again and must‚Äîout of necessity‚Äîhunt.  Being a layabout is a good survival strategy.But some races progressed beyond mere daily survival and built high civilizations.  They have hobbies.

                Much of that is simply attributable to lower average cognitive function levels.  One of my kids asked a question about how someone in the check out line could have several thousand in tattoos, hold a $1200 iPhone and carry a $500 handbag, yet swipe an EBT card.  Answer‚Äìlower cognitive ability correlates with very poor time preference skills.  There is literally no notion that avoiding the tattoos and a cheaper phone means you can pay tuition for the education that might mean you will have sufficient money to make all those purchases AND not be on welfare.

            In my California days one of the most liberal pissants I knew privately hated blacks.

            ‚ÄúThey think the classic ‚Äúpants around the ankles‚Äù look of the 1990s gangsta comes from a practice called ‚Äúbuck breaking,‚Äù in which slaveholders raped their field hands to show ‚Äôem who‚Äôs boss.‚ÄùMy understanding of that fad was that it came from prison.  Wearing your pants half way down your ass or lower meant you were ‚Äúavailable‚Äù for some good times shall we say.  I‚Äôm sure if that were made public, a lot of people who wear their pants like that would quickly pull them up.

                My understanding is that it‚Äôs prison chic, but not that kind. Inmates in maximum security aren‚Äôt allowed belts, since they can be made into weapons / suicide aides / both (aka ‚Äúthe Epstein special‚Äù) very easily. So, wearing your pants halfway down your ass was supposed to indicate that you‚Äôre the kind of tough G who would be sent to maximum security. But who knows? Maybe it‚Äôs just a stupid fad; Blacks hardly have a monopoly on looking like morons while chasing fads.

            Severian ‚Äì mere speculation, but I was thinking about the degree to which tribal people lived in mythic time. For example: Horsa and Hengist, though interacting with people living in historical time, claimed to be something like 8th grandchildren of Wodin. Same seems to be true for the Viking. How shocking it must have been to interact with historical people.I wonder if it might be true that blacks also live in mythic time: a great oppression was lifted by heroes who claimed their birthright of having been kangs and so forth. Maybe that‚Äôs a beginning of understanding the expression of black self-understanding.

                The Scandinavian environment selects very harshly for future time preference, so I doubt they took any of that ‚Äúgrandson of Odin‚Äù stuff literally. Regarding Blacks, though, this is their one and only gripe that I agree with: They have no past to speak of. Worse, even if they knew exactly to which West African tribe their ancestors belonged, it wouldn‚Äôt matter, because those tribes had no accomplishments to their name either. I‚Äôm not saying the entire problem with the whole non-White world is ‚Äúa crushing historical inferiority complex‚Äù‚Ä¶. but I‚Äôm not not saying it either.

            ‚ÄúI observed that Blacks live in a world totally devoid of personal agency.‚ÄùToo right. Cucks are always complaining that blacks are treated as if they have no agency. There‚Äôs a reason they are: blacks generallyhaveno agency.Their consciousness has been shaped by countless generations of life in Africa. The weather doesn‚Äôt change much seasonally as it does in temperate zones. Near the equator the length of days is similar year-round. There‚Äôs no reason to plan ‚Äî they just wait for animal prey to wander into spear range. They don‚Äôt build boats; why go anywhere when, as far as Africans can imagine, it will be the same as their own territory.Negroes‚Äô hormonal storms are survival traits for the tribal wars synonymous with native Africa.In short, they are well adapted to life in their ancestral environment. They are square pegs in other environments with different cultural values. No amount of remedial classes, government jobs, and midnight basketball will change that.Over time, encouraging blacks to return whence they came will be a boon to blacks and whites.

                One of the conspiracy things going around Black social media actually WAS attributed to Hitler. Something about how, in the absence of his Reich, America was certain to dominate the world, because it had the most Jews‚Ä¶ and, of course, the Blacks are the *real* Jews, because of course they are (I swear to you this is 100% real).

        I don‚Äôt have any social media, but my ‚Äòlady friends‚Äô do and I just can‚Äôt even‚Ä¶ as the progs would say.If one more middle / upper class white women posts her mandatory BLM and virtue signaling screed‚Ä¶ it is so fake, cowardly, and disgusting. If theyreallywant to help they need to do the same thing I recommended when it wasde rigueurnot that long ago to also virtue signal about illegal immigrants being housed in shelters.If you want blacks ahead here are your steps to rocket them forward white lady. Remember what I said earlier this week the strategy must be.Agree &amp; Amplify1) Give your current paper pushing 6 figure salary make-work job to a black person who is a new hire. You taketheirjob to show you are ‚Äòdown for the struggle‚Äô thereby losing a zero off your current salary. If you aren‚Äôt willing to do that then you need to at least donate 50% of your salary every month to a black family in need.2)Immediatelylet a black family move into your luxurious house. You have plenty of space and there are so many ghetto families living stacked in small shitty apartments like cordwood. They would LOVE to chill at da crib in your McMansion.These two are a ‚Äògood start‚Äô. If you can‚Äôt manage this Nice White Lady and/or Shitlib Box Wine Aunt you are an incorrigible racist and need to beshamed and socially destroyed.I‚Äôve said it before, turn these fucking lunatics weapons against them. Make a LOT of noise and start pointing fingers at these fake and spineless virtue signalers. You will get woke points and will never be banned for demanding more and you will also get to terrorize these mental midgets. Its a win-win.

            Oh my gawd. The fuggin women. They fall for this shite hook, line, and sinker. Back in my naive days I used to think it was essential to know something about our rulers and I bought ‚ÄúThe Audacity Of Hope‚Äù by Barkie Obutthole.I got a couple chapters in and gave up. It was like Xirl Science except in negro flavour. Like our blog host, I came to the conclusion that The Magic Negro viewed EVERYTHING through the lens of race, and that if elected‚Ä¶ that would be what American politics would be all about. My shitlib mother called me names and accused me of all The Bads. I gave her Obama‚Äôs book, told her to read it, and call me names AFTER she‚Äôd done so. No dice, I was a racist, a fascist, literally worse than You-Know-Who. I learned later from Dad that she‚Äôd gotten a few chapters in and threw the book away. She was a Good White, and she wouldn‚Äôt concede a single inch to a Bad White. She called me names, I called her a stupid bitch ‚Ä¶ and it went that way with all the women in our pozzed family. The men would teeter, politically speaking‚Ä¶ but the women were all in for social justice and no bones about it‚Ä¶

            After these snitching sessions of ordinary people reach critical mass, there‚Äôs going to be a massive stigma associated with using social media unless Zuck and others start to crack down.Only the 15 or so percent of true believers actually like snitches.

                Agreed. I think the most frightening thing to me is children doxxing their parents for thought crimes so that black people can come to their homes and harm them. I never thought I‚Äôd see this day in America, but it‚Äôs upon us now.

            Apparantly the parents backed off because the charges have been dropped.Tucker had a segment that showed a white teenager breaking down in tears about how much she hated her ‚Äúracist‚Äù parents and family.Get your kids out of schools! No TVs in the house either. No personal sail foam until they are 18 for them either. Preferably move to Green Bank, West Virginia (cell service/wi-fi outlawed).It is outrageous that our society has reached this point where you basically need to totally shelter your kids from the world.But I hope this goes on and gets way worse.You can not be neutral!

            What‚Äôs even more disturbing are the comments. Read through some of them and you‚Äôll see how flawed these neo-Marxists are; they literally can‚Äôt decipher facts on race and violence without resorting to personal insults against ‚Äúracists‚Äù. It‚Äôs sickening, but we‚Äôre chest deep in a cultural war and it‚Äôs going to worsen. I highly suggest that Dissidents become familiar with the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and how it mirrors what‚Äôs currently unfolding across the West.

        As a native of the deep South and a former college basketball player, I‚Äôve been around blacks all my life. With most black athletes, it took me beating the hell out of one of them to earn their respect. One tormentor would insult me constantly, try to injure me with cheap shots (imagine the punishment doled out by the ‚ÄúBad Boy‚Äù era Detroit Pistons or mid-1990s New York Knicks) and eventually, they‚Äôd provoke me into a confrontation that I won by punching the guy in the face. If I had a dollar for the times in practices where I had to take a swing at a black teammate, I‚Äôd be a rich man.Once I was accepted as a ‚Äúballer‚Äù and an alpha male who didn‚Äôt back down like other whites when confronted, I earned their respect and they accepted me as one of their own. That‚Äôd be when they‚Äôd talk very frankly about various conspiracies such as how the CIA invented AIDS, how certain things in the tap water were designed to emasculate black men, etc.When I‚Äôd press them for a source, they‚Äôd inevitably cite their homie down the street. When I told them they should verify anything they hear or read with independent sources, they looked at me like I had lobsters crawling from my ears.One of the dirty little secrets about college athletics, especially football (our directional commuter school didn‚Äôt have a team when I was there, but I‚Äôve seen the ‚Äúacademic center‚Äù built exclusively for the football team) and men‚Äôs basketball is that the amount of fraud that takes place in order for these guys to first qualify to even get into school and then keep them eligible is rampant, even at the little piss-ant schools like I attended.Tutors do all of their school work for them and most of them, dumber than a box of 10-penny nails, are unable to do college-level work even in the crib majors that our coaches directed them to study. Even with their work largely being done for them, my teammates struggled mightily to even show up for class, which required our coaches to bird-dog them like elementary school kids.The NCAA has made rules to make it harder for schools to pass a lot of these mental midgets, but the athletic programs continue to skirt them with all of these ‚Äúacademic centers‚Äù and other dodges like the no-show classes that weren‚Äôt enough to get UNC sanctioned.All this to entertain the wealthy alumni and keep them donating, preferably to the athletic department so they can have nicer facilities and recruit more black athletes, who receive useless degrees and a tiny chance at wealth in the pros in exchange for playing sports.Why normies root for these athletes, most of whom hate them, just because they wear the colors of their alma mater is beyond me.

            Another dirty secret about college athletics is that the ‚Äúcampus rape crisis‚Äù is coming almost exclusively from the black athletes, not from white jocks. But since white women are not allowed to lash out against those higher up on the pyramid than them (black men), they‚Äôre forced to punch down on those lower on the pyramid (white men).

                my experience jives (heh) with all the above. I tired of the blackness of basketball so much, in fact, I took up fighting directly instead of basketball under the constant threatpoint of fighting. violence is their language. Speak it or get spoken to.I got exceptionally good at shooting from range in part to minimize contact. But eventually they bring contact to you regardless.In college I played one of the whitest sports. It was fantastic. But my love of basketball would keep me close to the other side. Granted I am old and sore now but I won‚Äôt play ball with more than one black body on the court.A dear female friend played ball at a top 5 D1 program. The retardation and violence and lesbot aggression was a huge issue at most schools. Luckily her coach was excellent and kept it under control.This didn‚Äôt, however, protect her from receiving an unsolicited muh black dick from the men‚Äôs team. She wasnt the only one.All this covid risk fear is nothing compared to sending your young coeds to State U full of actual (black) rape culture. And sorry but its not the LAX team.

            Thirty years ago, as an undergrad at a small-time, yet D-1, school, I had an English class in room that was used for a math course for the vibrant members of the basketball team.  If I got to the room early enough I would see what had been left on the blackboard.  To call it first-grade level mathematics would insult 6 year olds.  I wondered why they didn‚Äôt dispense with the charade and just quietly comp them credit hours.  It was a Catholic University so maybe they felt morally obliged to make a pretense of education.

                    Not related to race, but a guy from my neighborhood played on a D-1 National Championship football team in the 70s.  His father was a local cop and later police chief of our town.  His father went down to school one weekend for a game and started ripping his son for selling drugs.  How else could he have so many nice things in his apartment?  Guy (who played cornerback) says, ‚Äúdad, if I make a pickoff today, you‚Äôll see.‚Äù  Sure enough he intercepts a pass in the game.  After the game, he comes out of the locker room and several alumni come up to him and shake his hand, congratulating him on a good game.  He walks over to his dad and shows him the wad of cash he‚Äôd just had placed in his palm.My friend is white, but I can just imagine how this goes today with all the widespread negrophilia among the rich, white crowd.

        Dark Matter and STEM‚Äôs lost opportunities.  She‚Äôs is absolutely correct.  We allow all kinds of opportunities to slip through our hands in all scholarly and research communities because of all the time and energy we spend attempting to slay the racism dragon.  It‚Äôs just that Ms. Johnson has all the pieces of the puzzle poorly arranged.The ‚Äòtalented 1/10th‚Äô of Blacks shoehorned into white institutions are barely average. Most are well below average. So far below average that their theses and dissertations are largely ghost written to just get them up to being minimally acceptable. They take up positions earned by white boys and girls who are capable of doing serious useful work.  White kids are brow beat from an early age.  Many now just ride out their school years just to get it over with and to get away from the daily struggle sessions.  Consider the opportunity costs of savaging, dulling and damming off all of those naturally smart white kids.  It‚Äôs not just STEM. It‚Äôs all of scholarship and every single sector of our society. We cut down orchards to make room for scrublands.

            I will quibble. Blacks take positions that were to be filled by more capable whites, yes, but in a sane society at least half the whites in college would not be there. This half, or more, of white society then find themselves seeking jobs that should not exist created for people like them. The fact that it takes two blacks to do the job which should not exist that are designed to not be done by one white man is another question.

                I agree with you. 15% to 20% of high school grads are capable of handling and would benefit both themselves and their society from a rigorous university program. 5% at the graduate level. We‚Äôre pushing 70% at this point.  There used to be more practical pathways to learning and training for those less intellectually drive or able.  Because the system was so hell bent on opening itself up to Blacks it by default had to expand and open itself to all comers‚Ä¶maybe soon taking an application from Koko the gorilla who has a higher IQ than some of our current scholazzz.Our people are so badly damaged that many very capable kids have had their development snuffed out well before they even enter secondary school.  Most of the potential in our tribe, especially in the most sensitive, dies an early death. The brow beating white kids take every day of their lives from the  anti-white agenda in our educational institutions starting in preschool and kindergarten‚Ä¶and the war and misdirection against whites in all of youth pop culture are psyop war crimes. Our school children are so young and have no real ability or understanding in how to push back are fed a CNN tier and worse constant dose of ‚Äúwhite is evil‚Äù propaganda.Maybe Bartleby was a Mozart who was ground down by a civilization that had pushed aside beauty for material pursuits. How many Bartlebys are we churning out in a civilization in which our past is killed off, our present is penance and our future is non existence?We‚Äôve lost so much of what could have been that it is painful to look upon what we are.

                Several philosophers. Hoffer was a wealth of wisdom.The resentment of the weak does not spring from injustice‚Ä¶but from the sense of inadequacy and impotence.We cannot win the weak by sharing our wealth. They feel our generosity as oppression.Craving, not loving, is the mother of reckless giving of oneself.Resentment becomes a constituent principle of want of character.That which corrodes the soul of the persecuted is the monstrous inner agreement with the prevailing prejudice against them.

            People don‚Äôt value something that was not earned.As a people, what have blacks ever earned in the US?The answer is nothing, not even their freedom.Hundreds of thousands of white lives have been thrown away to grant blacks freedom in the US.Not finding a way to pick our own damn cotton is the worst mistake this country ever made.

            I read a lot of Gary North in 1970s-80s. He often preaches against envy. Of couse I can‚Äôt recall the exact quote, and he was not dealing with race, but envy in general. But here‚Äôs a paraphrase: ‚ÄúIf you are among the better-off in a society, it does no good to pay compensation (or support) to the worse-off. In fact, your very ability to do so will arouse hatred and envy in them.‚Äù North was very much an advocate for what they now call prepping and forming rural, tight-knit communities. If you like pessimism, North is a must-read üôÇ

            It‚Äôs really no mystery. Blacks would be far happier with a lower standard of living than they have right now if only whites were doing no better than they. It is a fact rooted in surveys that people, and white people no less, when offered a theoretical choice between seeing their incomes double in ten years while the income of wealthier people quadrupled, vs everybody‚Äôs income improving 50%, choose the latter.The alternative is acknowledging that Blacks lived happier lives in the days when they were entirely separate, by law or through free association.

                I am dubious that this would only apply to Blacks. Income inequality is, in fact, a long-term social ill and, when it grows (like it has in the USA for decades), is a predictor of social, political and economic ills. Not saying everybody must be equal, but the opposite extreme isn‚Äôt very nice either.

        I lived until my early teens in a majority black city(murder rate higher than Detroit). After us older ones left the confines and protection of Catholic schools we learned real quick about the other race. Dad did everything to sell the house and get us out of there but eventually surrendered the home and took the hit. A few months later after moving my best friend was stabbed and more hi-jinks followed after that.I have worked with them, interacted with them in my subsequent years. I have had good dealings in business but that doesn‚Äôt negate all the rest of the crap they bring to the table. It has never worked with them and it never will.Is there some kind of program like the witness protection program where whites can be relocated and given a new identity in a white community? Something like the covert village Patrick McGoohan was dropped into in The Prisoner.

        I was thinking about a lot of these issues yesterday.I grew up in the south post-civil rights.  In high school, everyone still self-segregated.  Whites with whites.  Blacks with blacks.  A smattering of Asians. Little animosity but always frank acknowledgement of racial difference to the point of epithets but I don‚Äôt ever recall discord.  However, little social interaction and black-white dating didn‚Äôt happen.Fast forward to today.  I exercise in a park where plenty of people hang out and float tube down the river.  Plenty of white-black couples among the younger set and mixed groups in general.  Never would have happened when I was growing up.Of course, hordes of people have moved here since my time in high school but I‚Äôm wondering if this aspect is sustainable in the long term.  More and more, it does seem to me like the majority of the younger generation have a fundamental view of the world completely different from my generation and the ones that came before them.  Exclusively present-oriented, malleable to whatever officially sanctioned opinion is put on by the media, they will go whichever way the PTB tells them to go.  And be real smug about it.I think what happens inevitably is we become more like Latin America.  Mestizo mixes everywhere.  High crust whites (ahem) still calling the shots with a few asian and hindus thrown in the hierarchy.The pyramid wins again.

            The miscegenation process you describe would take a long time to bear fruit‚Äìso to speak. ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù will fracture and a white ethnostate will form long before that occurs.

                Just tell me where to move‚Ä¶.The conceptual problem I have with an ethnostate is how  does it happen.  What‚Äôs the engine that‚Äôs going to convince millions of ethnic Euroamericans to pull up stakes and settle away from where they are currently.  I could see it happening but my crystal ball says it would only do so in reaction to severe pressure.Another interesting idea is county rights.  Plenty of small enclaves exist even now and the office of sheriff contains more authority than most people realize.

                    The motive force for the ethnostate will be multiple massacres of innocent, peaceful whites in their own neighborhoods or at gatherings of some sort. Perhaps a white neighborhood or two will be torched. In any event, this will precipitate the creation of neighborhood militias‚Äìwhich are already forming, BTW‚Äìand the linkage of those militias into armies of a sort. A hot war will ensue, and thenceforth demands for and creation of the ethnostate. That‚Äôs how I see this playing out.

                Show it to me‚Ä¶ANYevidence of a white ethnostate forming. Surely this far into the death spiral it should have started by now, right? And given the current political climate I‚Äôm sure once TPTB found out about it they would definitely not deploy the full might of the police state against it. They would just reverse decades of forced integration by gunpoint and let you go your own way.Every time you comment here lately I wonder what the color of the sky is on the planet you are currently inhabiting.

                    Have to agree with Apex. Whites are a minority in California and are close in other states. Do you see white identity movements starting in any of them?The U.S. isn‚Äôt going to break up into smaller countries. What‚Äôs far more likely is Brazil, a big mess of everything where a 90%-95% white elite rule over various shades of brown. The middle class is small and too buy fending off the criminal class to make waves.

                    Organization obviously precedes the creation of the ethnostate, and, although in inchoate state, this is occurring on the neighborhood level with the creation of militias. Arms and ammo sales are going through the roof because it‚Äôs finally dawning on whites what‚Äôs at stake. These are all early preparations for creating the ethnostate. What will trigger the great leap of white consciousness and martial bellicosity is atrocities against whites so heinous and consequential that even the AWR media cannot cover them up. These events will happen. One would have to be ‚Äúobtuse‚Äù to think otherwise.As for you, I‚Äôm afraid you are a black pill salesman whose raging defeatism is terrible for our side.

                    Most white people have an innate repulsion toward blacks that must be overcome by wall-to-wall propaganda and miseducation. The unnatural is pitted against the natural.

            My interactions with Blacks is limited. The only positive one I can cite: My last year or so in the Army was at Pentagon, conveniently close to where I‚Äôd grown up (Washington DC suburbs). Still, I hardly knew downtown, it was seedly even in 1980s. In the military your friends are usually the people you work with, so Andy &amp; I hung out some. We did a couple trips into the hood just for atmosphere. Andy wasn‚Äôt local, but he‚Äôd attended American University so knew the area. These field trips were a bit of an education to me, even if it was only to go to Bass Liquors on Rhode Island Avenue. Years later, I learned that the Black service members (and whites, to lesser degree) came from the better grade of citizens. Applied to an employer: if you are offered a Black man with an honorable discharge, you immediately know some important factors you can‚Äôt easily know otherwise: His IQ is &gt; 85 (50th percentile or better), he had no serious criminal record including juvenile and he wasn‚Äôt likely to abuse drugs and generally in good health, and finally, could take orders and do a job. If 70% of all young adults are unfit to join (all races), it follows that the honorably discharged are the better 30%. Due to Black‚Äôs inherent faults, I‚Äôd guess for them that number would be closer to the top 10%. Hmm, the talented tenth.

                Interesting point.  Many, many years ago worked construction in the summer.  Superintendent of our crews was an ex airborne guy from Vietnam.  Had a lot of black guys on the crews.  Office sent a new guy they hired who was black.  Almost the moment the super found out he was honorably discharged Army, he put him in charge of the other black guys.

            Basil,I grew up in as a kid in the South and the same dynamic was present. Elementary school was 50/50 white/black and outside of a few black high performance students ne‚Äôer the two shall meet.  We were happier that way and by all observations and metrics‚Ä¶ so were the black kids.

            Surprised and discouraged to hear this.Even in Canada, race-mixing isn‚Äôt that common. You might see a few trashy white women with a black, and some minority SWPL types with trendy urban women. The Middle and especially Upper Middle classes are very, very white and this doesn‚Äôt appear to be changing.Essentially they are using your tax dollars to subsidize affirmative action jobs for blacks ‚Äì and they use that money to be attractive enough to marry a white woman.

        There is some hope emerging from the black undertow we‚Äôve been subjected to for decades: I‚Äôm seeing increasing calls from blacks in the mainstream media, like the New York Times, for black children to be taught only by black teachers, for black neighborhoods to be policed only by blacks, for black people to be treated only by black doctors, for only black businesses to be allowed in black neighborhoods, and so on.These calls should be encouraged. For now, the calls are one-sided: blacks are demanding segregation at the same time as they continue to demand to push into white neighborhoods and white institutions, and for a cut of white resources to be redirected to themselves.But over time this may change: re-segregation of black businesses, teachers, doctors, police and firemen, etc. may gradually redirect the attention of the ‚Äútalented tenth‚Äù (which has barely been able to keep its head above water in the white world) back to looking after its own race, as once used to be the case.Blacks and badwhites never really wanted integration anyway: it was a foreign concept pushed on the two by goodwhites (northeastern Yankees then and now) who only ever knew one black person, W.E.B. DuBois.There may eventually come a time when blacks will march and chant ‚ÄúSegregation Now, Segregation Tomorrow, and Segregation Forever‚Äù without a hint of self-reflection, irony or sarcasm, and this should be encouraged.

            NEVER!  Access to white people, white neighborhoods, white schools and white institutions are what blacks want more than anything. To the extent that they do want to segregate, it is only the upper class blacks who only want to segregate to upper class black neighborhoods, schools and institutions.  It really bothers them that they can‚Äôt move to an all black neighborhood.  As soon as white people started agreeing to black seperation, they would immediately begin calling them white supremacists.  They would very quickly learn that the children of upper class blacks have higher crime rates than lower class whites and that their children do worse than poor whites.

            My wife listens to a podcast of the sermon at a church we go to (mainly to get free dinners).  The topic today was of course, RACISM.  In the middle of the pastor‚Äôs obsequious, grovelling speech this recent Chinese immigrant popped up and went on a long rant about how there‚Äôs plenty of anti-Asian racism and the blacks get all the attention, etc‚Ä¶  Eventually they cut his mic and moved on.  It was hilarious and sad that it took a foreigner with broken Engrish to try to put some reality back into things.  The capitulation of the Evangelical churches to the poz in the last 30 years has been depressing and horrifying to watch.

        Blacks are parasites on Whites. We will never be rid of them until we forcibly evict them from our settlement areas.

        Sane non-Anglo ancestry Euro-Americans that still have ties to their ancestral lands should consider moving back. America is lost. If you say that you need to stay and fight, then ask yourself what was stopping you until now? The truth is you will never fight unless you have nothing to lose. And by then it will be too late. It‚Äôs probably too late now and you are still too comfortable anyway.Anglos, you‚Äôre screwed. Your ancestral land is on life support and most of your co-ethnics are busy giving away the last remnants of it.

                        In Italy the bloodline laws date back to 1861, or when the unification into a single country was completeSo if you can prove you have blood relatives from that point forward, you‚Äôre in. But the farther removed becomes an increasing obstacleMy brother already has his Italian citizenship, so me getting mine is just an expense of getting all the birth certs and paperwork together.

Whatever you do, get it done before you turn ~60. Just seems like a general wall for every man. Common sense? Well, old-age will still bitch slap you, even when you expect it.

                I agree.  Even just having the ability to cut and run gives people a sense of comfort as things continue the downhill spiral (‚Äò‚Ä¶well, if things get really bad I can go back to X‚Äô)  The European mutt problem is the result of the evil of multiculturalism, even when it is confined to just one race.

                    It‚Äôs also their homelandthat‚Äôs the thingThe question is are you willing to share it with them?  The reality is America is never going to be anything but a mixed-race country.  It will always bear the traces of its colonial past.  So if the country goes the way of being partitioned, what is your land today (the land within America‚Äôs borders) is not going to be your land tomorrow.  You are going to have to give a lot of it away to give them their space.But you never know.  We could have a major war where all the blacks and the browns are sent off to die fighting for Freedom and Democracy (copyrighted).

                        I mostly agree. There is nowhere to send American blacks back to. Unlike ‚Äúbrowns,‚Äù I tend to think of blacks as fellow Americans.The best option that is realistic is when the US finally admits to being broke and the police state collapses, allowing us freedom of association will be the only solution. This should be extended to both blacks and whites.I think a good number of whites will remain multicultural. But there will be plenty who want ‚Äúgood schools‚Äù and ‚Äúsafe neighborhood‚Äù and kids will grow up without being propagandized to hate themselves and that will become ‚Äúnormalized.‚Äù

                            I think the place is already brokeSomething is up.  The government is paranoid and acting desperate.  Not saying it is broke per se, but that is not the behavior of a confident organization.  Maybe because of the feminization of society it‚Äôs the ‚Äúhell hath no fury‚Äù writ large.  These women are pissed that the serfs aren‚Äôt obeying them.  Look at Pelosi with Trump; she can‚Äôt control him so she goes ballistic. And look at Whitmer.So, it‚Äôs hard for me to tell if this isn‚Äôt just a huge female freakout permeating society top to bottom, at least to a large extent, or whether there is something real behind the scenes that is making the government becoming a petty tyrant.  Either way, it‚Äôs not the signs of a government that feels it is really in charge.

        Zman: I am a fan.¬†¬†I agree with 90% of what you write.¬†¬†The following comment is just a minor qualification.I‚Äôve lived 20 of the last 22 years in the Old Confederacy and will live out my life here, God willing.¬†¬†To say (as you did at around 37 minutes) that ‚Äúyou are going to run into a lot of blacks in Appalachia‚Äù is misleading.South Carolina and the Coastal Plain of North Carolina (East of I-95) are large, flat, fertile, well-watered plains and accordingly were ideal for cultivation using the large plantation methods with large slave dependent staffs used in similar areas in the rest of the Antebellum South.¬†¬†As a result, these areas are heavily populated with the descendants of slaves.As one travels West, the terrain becomes more mountainous and less congenial to large plantations and large slaveholdings.¬†¬†Farmers in Appalachia did not own slaves, at least not the huge dependent staffs found on the plantations in the Coastal areas.¬†¬†As a result, one finds fewer relict blacks.A typical Coastal Plain town is Lumberton NC (elevation 131 feet) with a population of 21k and a 37% black population, the largest ethnic group.¬†¬†A typical Appalachian town is Hendersonville NC (altitude 2,200 feet) with a population of 14k and an 81% white population.The Metropolitan Statistical Area where I live is in Appalachia (altitude 2,000 feet), has a population of 100k and a 92% white population.

        It would be interesting to know with the BLM people think about this statement‚Ä¶‚ÄúThe worst enemy that the Negro have is this white man that runs around here drooling at the mouth professing to love Negros and calling himself a liberal, and it is following these white liberals that has perpetuated problems that Negros have. If the Negro wasn‚Äôt taken, tricked or deceived by the white liberal, then Negros would get together and solve our own problems. I only cite these things to show you that in America, the history of the white liberal has been nothing but a series of trickery designed to make Negros think that the white liberal was going to solve our problems. Our problems will never be solved by the white man.‚ÄùMalcolm X

            I agree most strongly with his final sentence. The criticism of well-meaning liberals is correct too. The problem is broader than just white-black relations. Whether it is how you provide for your own children, or try to give aid to worse-off people or countries, there is a fine line between fostering self-reliance, helping out the truly needy in a temporary pinch, or encouraging or subsidizing failure, or for that matter, providing custodial care to those who really can‚Äôt fend for themselves. Charity is a positive good, but it should be applied intelligently.

        Most Europeans have no connection to America‚Äôs Black problem. We‚Äôre just not interested that they are Black any more than we are interested that someone is Mexican, Asian or Native American.Ask any European about their attitude towards Blacks (or any other ethnic group in America) and you‚Äôll quickly discover we are not that interested. If you asked someone from Norway ‚ÄúWhat to you think about Black Americans?‚Äù the most likely answer would be, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think about them at all.‚ÄùAnd that‚Äôs the problem. Blacks know White America isn‚Äôt interested in them anymore and they want you to be.They know that White Americans once cared about them so much  White America went to war with each other over them. And when that war was over, White Americans made laws to abolish slavery. And since then White Americans have given Blacks every possible opportunity, and every possible advantage. Why? Because White Americans cared about them.150-years later, Black Americans now have everything they could have ever imagined. They‚Äôre successful in sports and entertainment and many have excelled in science, engineering, law, medicine and as military leaders.But deep inside it‚Äôs not really about BLM or equality or jobs or education or wealth and success. Blacks want the most fundamental thing every human being wants from the day we are born. And that is to be loved and cared about.Specifically, they want White Americans to keep on caring about them, because the real inconvenient truth is ‚Äì no one else on this planet cares about them at all. Not even their own people.

        The reason we have no moon base, no city on Mars, no robot butlers, no immortal talking heads in jars or any of the other stuff we were supposed to have now is because there are not enough negro scientists.We don‚Äôt have enough negro scientists because White people are involved in a secret conspiracy, to hurt and oppress negroes and cause them to fail. As a result of this conspiracy, negroes are poor, and the poverty then causes them to kill each other nonstop.Of course, poor Whites don‚Äôt act like that. But it‚Äôs more complicated for negroes, because not only are they poor, but they also get their feelings hurt by the secret White anti-negro conspiracy.All poor American negroes want is free everything forever, for them and their entire extended families,¬†and their dozens of future children, and all of the future generations to come. Is that really so much to ask, White man? After‚Ä¶ the Holocaust?

            The thing is, many poor whites *do* take on ghetto culture. Dalrymple documents this quite well inLife at the Bottom. There is always a violent underclass of your ethnic group (just as there is a upper, ruling class), even in a homogeneous nation. America‚Äôs is worse than most because it combines the problems of the underclass with the problems of African genetic personalities and a chameleon (((upper class))).

                Yes , forgive me , I meant poor Whites in general, by population . Those that live on the East Coast of Canada or in Appalachia for instance .I do understand what you mean and it‚Äôs difficult to observe. The other thing I‚Äôd add is that when you have only one or two negroes they will try to conform to the White standard. When you inflict a plurality of negoes on poor Whites, many of them will be dragged down to the negroes level.Liberals believe that policies like school integration will exert a civilizing force and magically raise up the negro who will model their behaviour on their fellow classmates . This defies Newton‚Äôs law that for every force there is an equal and opposite reaction ‚Äì that the negro will drag down the human.When you have negroes , a Liberal society will treat everyone as a negro, because to do otherwise would be ‚Äò unfair ‚Äò to the negroes. All social norms and standards are dragged down to accommodate the lowest common denominator.Everyone with any sense, knows that without an anchor point, one cannot pull the other, without also being dragged somewhere towards the middle. And that anchor point is precisely what Whites are abandoning.By accommodating negroes we abandon first principles and standards such as free speech and free association, which could possibly exert a more beneficial force upon them. By doing this we slip backwards into superstition.The proscription against the word n*gger, is one such superstition, that transforms it into a magic word . The word itself is transformed by negroes, into a talisman or incantation that absolves the negro of their own negritude .There is a reason that Liberals are concerned with the meaning of words. Words are powerful. ‚Äú My daughter married a gentleman of colour ‚Äú does not carry the same meaning as, ‚Äú My daughter married a n*gger‚Äù. This is a very old principle.To reference Zman‚Äôs post from yesterday. After the war between Athens and Sparta started :‚ÄúWords had to change their ordinary meaning and to take that which was now given them. Reckless audacity came to be considered the courage of a loyal ally; prudent hesitation, specious cowardice; moderation was held to be a cloak for unmanliness; ability to see all sides of a question inaptness to act on any.‚Äù‚Äì Thucidides 3.82.4Negroes destroy everything they touch. There‚Äôs no reason to soft pedal this with qualifiers such as ‚ÄúNot because I dislike negroes‚Äù.

        Just seen Trump is rescheduling his 1st rally due to some made up black nonsensical word (Juneteenth ‚Äì WTF sort of word is that ) that was in 2 books a year in the 2000s and is somehow now a Black Holiday.Its now obvious that Trump is part of the uniparty system and his role is to act as the Judas goat to bring in a dominant (((black))) culture over whites in the US. He is the good cop part of this routine.Its getting annoying that people can‚Äôt see the pro-wrestling aspect of this and in a way I am astounded at how quickly they have managed to cement Trump as some sort of white saviour while everything he has done concretely has been against their interests. Prison ‚Äúreform‚Äù, Increase 3rd world legal immigration, promotion of blacks in authortiy and women at every opportunity, lack of action on any of this BLM/Antifa/coup crap etc etc.I imagine the techniques are very similar to the techniques used for Stalin and Mao for the cult of personality creation they tested out in those areas first.Solzhenitsyn wrote that even in the Gulags many people wrote letters to Stalin assuming that he would save them and he had just made a mistake in their case as they were loyal members of the party. Places like CTH are looking pretty similar in their delusions.

        There is no solution to any of this (except isolating yourself from it), because what these do-gooders are asking for doesn‚Äôt exist in the real world.  They are asking for a black escape from the very human emotions of pain and sadness.  Blackity-black is just focusing on it to create a vicious cycle of intense hurt, and placing blame for it.  If our wealthy modern culture has taught us anything, it is that wealth and success does not take the pain away.Then there is the matter of leveraging black angst, by others, to tear down our culture and everything we have ever held dear.  But that is a backstory for another day.

        One of the most effective measures to use against black hyper racism is apathy.It drives them nuts that we don‚Äôt care that Trump speaks in Tulsa.The United States is refighting the American Civil War to a large degree.This time Washington and Jefferson get reconstructed along with us Confederates.

        The sad part is Ms Johnson is not fully black.  This woman is at least 1/2 white, possibly one of her parents a mulatto.I have noticed that mulattoes are the most woke of woke POC.  Like Obama, most mulattoes barely know their black parent, if they know them at all.  The statistics of white women who are mothers of 1/2 black children are appalling and even worse than black women.  Over 90% of these women are single mothers and the high 80s of those women receive no help at all and a very high percentage of those women have no contact at all with the black father.  I notice this Johnson woman mentioned her mother in the article and not her father.  These poor children embrace their 1/2 blackness as a stand-in for their missing father.

            It really is worth spending a minute perusing Ms Johnson‚Äôs website athttps://www.ayanaelizabeth.com/and especially her photos page.  Aside from her exotic vacations, the page seems to exist entirely to show how photogenic she is and what a great addition her picture would make to your company brochure complete with black hair.  No hairhats on this woman.She is obviously very conscious of her role in climate change politics.  She does not exist to do actual work or even to pretend to do actual work. She is a decoration and she knows it. There is not a single picture of her pretending to do work. How sad this must be.  This is probably one of the root causes of her black resentment.

            I would suggest you‚Äôre missing the bigger issue.  They aren‚Äôt White and know they never will be.  They don‚Äôt look anything like their White mothers.  They are just smart enough, with their half White genetics, to realize they aren‚Äôt nearly as smart as the smart White kids.  It‚Äôs terminal envy and resentment (which all blacks feel) writ large.  Their entire life becomes an effort to repudiate their White half because they know they‚Äôll never measure up.

            Yes, I‚Äôve read a few woke articles on how COVID-19 is disproportionately affecting Blacks. You see, the poor dears are alerady downtrodden, and extra oppressed by this George Floyd mess. For some reason, nary a mention of their appalling lifestyle choices that contribute to their out-of-proportion obesity, smoking, drinking, drug abuse, STDs and various traits that tend to bad health outcomes, most of which are co-morbidities for COVID-19. But I guess Whites caused that, too.

                        Integration was initially to equalize the playing field.  Schools of all ‚Äúcolored folk‚Äù were deemed inherently unequal due to poor quality, funding, teachers, etc.  SCOTUS turned over ‚Äúseparate but equal‚Äù prior court ruling because they accepted the lie that these schools were what kept the poor colored folk unable to compete with Whites.Bussing was simply to insure that no school would be funded (treated) differently and the implicit assumption was that all students were the same and all would do well‚Äîregardless of classroom mixture‚Äîif treated equally.That is a fallacy that is still commonly brought up today by SJW‚Äôs three generations on.  The initial law suites by minorities actually had some merit.  The few higher level Black students excluded from White school did do better when removed from their all Black environment.  But as we now know, more than a smallish percentage of minority students produces an environment that kills the school experience for everyone else.  Hence white flight wherever bussing was implemented.

Maybe in sports üòÄI have a still livingfossilvenerable relative (on the white side of my family üòÄ ) who graduated from Anacostia High (WW II years). The city has changed a bit since then.

                                I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs an anomaly, but not an exception to the point I made above.  When you have a school‚Äîregardless of student race‚Äîthat is selective, and holds high standards, both academic and behavioral‚Äîyou can produce a Dunbar.Now obviously, you won‚Äôt get as many Black Dunbars as White Dunbars, but you can get them.  Just like we have a CalTech, an MIT, or a Georgia Tech‚Äîbut not one such institution in every State, just a select, special few across an entire nation.Here‚Äôs an example of the opposite effect: I sent both children to the one *public* gifted HS in the area‚Äîyep a public one.  Consistently ranked in top 5 or so *in the nation*.  So highly thought of that *all* graduates got a full ride scholarship to our State Universities and others as well.Shortly thereafter (after the kids graduated), the school Board turned ‚Äúpoz‚Äôd‚Äù and decided that such a school was discriminatory (too many Bright Whites from the University faculty) so they changed the admissions criteria to admit the top ten percent of all the grammar feeder schools.  Of course, those schools were in the main, minority enrollment schools, where the top ten percent was a meaningless measure of academic potential.  The best of the worse, does not produce scholarship.Well, as readers here have already guessed, in 3 or 4 years, the school vanished from the national rankings.  All that remains today is a pretentious name and past awards and noted alumni in some glass boxes in their auditorium.  But damn, they sure are diverse!

        Hope this isn‚Äôt too off-topic. After a recent thread on NextDoor tangentially related to today‚Äôs topic(s), and I wasn‚Äôt even the instigator :), after emailed replies to the thread had several posts deleted (not mine, but i can‚Äôt be sure), I decided to:I‚Äôm quitting NextDoorDear Friends and Neighbors,We live in a time of great unrest and division within our country. Like many people, I believe the media not only reports things in a biased manner, but that they actively promote points of view that endanger our country. The pervasive sense of ‚Äúpolitical correctness‚Äù seems to reach all media, including here. While privately owned media (like this) certainy have a right to demand certain standards of behavior from their users, I have seen first-hand messages deleted that come too close to ‚Äúthought police‚Äù for my tastes. I refuse to participate in such a forum, and so it with regret that I tender my resignation from Next Door. For those of you who remain, you are of course free to believe what you want, disbelieve (or be protected from?) adverse opinions or God forbid, facts, that might suggest the need to question commonly held beleifs or to question The Official Narrative. Speaking for myself (ok I stole the line from a country song) I would rather be hated for what I am than be loved for what I‚Äôm not.

            I‚Äôm on NextDoor. In a nice neighborhood down the street from me, a black lady posted a pic and vid of their house being vandalized. She posted video of white teenage girl in mask squirting corn syrup on porch and door. And a photo of ‚Äúgo away ni**ergs.‚Äù And ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù, written in chalk on her driveway.Won‚Äôt bore you with details, but all factors pointed to the family doing it themselves, with help of a few young radicals. There were over a hundred sympathetic replies to her post. NOT ONE questioned her. Almost every post read like: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry! It‚Äôs infuriating that this kind of thing is still happening in our country! I‚Äôm on the verge of tears. Our hearts go out to you and your family.‚ÄùI called the family out in an objective, non-inflammatory manner. I didn‚Äôt even mention race. The community freaked out on me. (Well, all the women.) Pretty much all variants of ‚ÄúHOW DARE YOU! You‚Äôre an AWFUL human being!‚Äù So most of my posts explaining why her story was suspect, were deleted. And I was sent warnings from NextDoor. Some commenters said I was a cowardly keyboard warrior. I offered to meet them at a local coffee shop. None took me up on it.It reminded me of how the world used to say Americans were so gullible and trusting. The Progs have really used that gullibility to their advantage.

        ‚ÄúMost white people, of course, have the good sense to not live around blackness, so they struggle with their whiteness.‚ÄùZman my friend, I think you are doing some satire here and I am missing part of it, so don‚Äôt be offended by my take.I don‚Äôt want to be around black folks. There are nice, hard working black folks who are decent; but I just don‚Äôt want to be around them if I don‚Äôt have to be; even though I have enjoyed a beer with a black or two over the years.So, I don‚Äôt live around blackness as you put it; but I damn sure don‚Äôt struggle with ‚Äúmy whiteness‚Äù.I can‚Äôt really take credit for the accomplishments of my white ancestors nor do I share any culpability for their crimes either.White people gave you the industrial revolution and therefore the modern technological world and global society. What the dindu is looting every chance he can is available to be stolen because white men built the modern world.So, yes I do think whites are superior to blacks in certain areas. Important areas. But blacks outperform whites at sports-ball.As I have said now for decades. People are not the same. Races are not the same. Don‚Äôt like that? So what; take it up with God as I had nothing to do with it.

            Re. ‚Äú I can‚Äôt really take credit for the accomplishments of my white ancestors nor do I share any culpability for their crimes either.‚ÄùSir,Please allow me to respectfully disabuse you of this rhetoric, that is uniquely effective on a small percentage of White men, for whom personal honour and integrity are still meaningful.1) The people arrayed against you are collectivists ‚Äì they believe in collective guilt and punishment. It doesn‚Äôt matter to them, that you think otherwise. The burden of your ancestors is yours whether you like it or not ‚Äì own it !2) Your heritage was passed to you as its steward. You are as responsible as I am, as are we all . We are more than individuals. We are part of long chain individuals in communities that run from our forefathers to our descendants.3) If we shirk our responsibility as fully integrated members of society, we become atomized individuals whom our enemies will pick of one at a time.Our foe doesn‚Äôt want us to take credit for something which we did not personally create while holding us to account for ‚Äòcrimes‚Äô that we did not perpetrate.Europeans were uniquely responsible for a politics of individual ‚Äòrights‚Äô.The politics of individualism in our current age of mass immigration and multicultural identities is fatal to White individuals . No nation was ever created and maintained by abstract individuals without particular identities and a strong sense of friend and foe.

        I was recently reading a book called ‚ÄúBlack Rage Confronts the Law‚Äù by Paul Harris.  I thought it a relatively recent thing. But blacks have been justifying murder and the like in courts of law in America since at least 1846.  The first chapter of the book discusses a case against a man called William Freeman. What a piece of work this guy was. He murdered a few people including a child after supposedly suffering the ‚Äúindignity‚Äù of being convicted for a crime he supposedly did not commit (they always dindu nuffin) and suffering several crimes against his dignity while in prison left him filled with a just-rage against the world and white people especially.It really is remarkable watching the relative, usually the mother, of someone killed by police or a store clerk or a homeowner shout about the indignity. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt have to shoot him!‚Äù even when their loving son had a gun pointed at the victim.  They take great offense that someone had the nerve to stand up to their boy who was just getting his life together and going back to school.  It is almost as like they are incapable of reasoning through the consequences of their actions and that only possible reason they could have had for shooting little (6‚Äô3‚Ä≥ 220lbs) Jamal  was cause he was black. I have been around blacks all of my life and I am still amazed by this.

        ‚ÄúRuction‚Äù: new word to me. Where do you find these, Z?‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the thing about black identity.

Obviously this is a broader problem that social justice. And hardly a new problem.

        So, it seems that the plan behind the current craziness must be to motivate the blacks to vote ‚Ä¶ that being the case, its almost a certainty that Biden will select that fat black female who narrowly lost the Georgia gubernatorial race as his VP, who will later become Prez when Biden taps out.  Trump needs the Hispanics to save his bacon.  Damn young white women will vote for Biden.

            I used to disparage Scott Adams for being a slow-talking arrogant bore. But any public personality who‚Äôs not bending over to blacks and our white masters right now is OK in my book. Takes a lot of balls. The first mainstream guy I heard promote the notion that American blacks were lucky for slavery was Joe Sobran. Though I think at that point he‚Äôd already lost his national syndication status. I probably read it in his private newsletter. Anyway, big ups to Scott.

                    The media is obviously going to keep the pot stirred all summer.  Since there‚Äôs an effectively unlimited supply of blacks willing to be violent against the police and since everything is now on video, there should be an unrelenting stream of video of police gunning down poor ol‚Äô Rodney Trayvon Floyd, who absolutely din du nuffin (except maybe aim a pistol at the cops).Just keep in mind that the Democratic and Republican National Conventions are in August.  By then there should at least 6 more dindu shootings and hopefully there will be a nice heat wave in both Milwaukee and Jacksonville.  All the ingredients are in place for a glorious big budget remake ofChaos in Chicago: 1968!

            It‚Äôs a riveting read for sure, but it‚Äôs still just civnattery. ‚ÄúWe are destroying one of the only truly successful ethnically diverse societies in modern history.‚Äù Yeah, this has never been true.Still, if I were to meet the writer in person, I wouldn‚Äôt insult or hurl them away.

        One thing that really disturbs me about the right in this ordeal is how we seem to have lost the ability to think for ourselves.I‚Äôm not just talking about feckless Republicans kneeling and selling us out, or gun-toting normies going all in on BLM, but how even those of us who do have our heads on straight seem to subconsciously imbibe leftist narratives and vocabulary, thereby automatically losing future arguments.For just one example, I noticed in the most recent Radio Derb, John referred to ‚Äúprotests and demonstrations‚Äù spreading to Europe. I respect and appreciate John deeply, so this isn‚Äôt intended as a ‚Äúpunch right‚Äù at all‚Äîif anything I‚Äôve had to catch myself making the same mistakes. It‚Äôs more me wondering why we continue to fall into the trap of letting the left set the parameters and vocabulary for what is right or wrong.‚ÄúProtests and demonstrations‚Äù jumped out at me because those words automatically set us up for failure down the road. This phrase bestows moral righteousness on the masses of nonwhites and white race traitors who have been ramping up their anti-white race hatred in the last few weeks. In point of fact, there have been no ‚Äúprotests and demonstrations‚Äù whatsoever since the guys with guns protested the virus lockdowns at various state capitols. Those were the last, most recent legitimate protests.Everything else since George Floyd got what he had coming to him has been race hatred. There is utterly no separation between ‚Äúpeaceful protestors‚Äù and ‚Äúa minority of rioters and looters.‚Äù Nope, they‚Äôre all one enemy group and they‚Äôre all illegitimate and horrendously violent. Walk with a group of ‚Äúpeaceful protestors,‚Äù listen to what they‚Äôre chanting and read what they‚Äôre carrying or spray-painting. It‚Äôs anti-white racial hatred to the extreme.Again, I don‚Äôt mean to pick on John‚Äîhe‚Äôs a national treasure. This is merely to point out how vulnerable we are at falling into the mental gymnastics that the left sets up for us as long as we keep subconsciously imbibing their vocabulary and dialectics.We saw the same thing with the take-off of the anti-white ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù slur on the right. Why do we keep digesting and parroting the left‚Äôs anti-white narratives and setting ourselves up for failure?

It‚Äôs as simple as defining bad thought and open discussion as ‚Äúhate‚Äù, then using such to taint the plea of self defense.  Unless I‚Äôve misread, Great Britain has made great strides in this area.  Saying there are too many foreigners in GB seems to land you in the Courts.Biggest fraud of all times was the creation of the Fed laws wrt hate crimes.  Every controversial White on Black incident is shortly thereafter announced to be Fed investigated as a hate crime candidate, albeit termed ‚Äúcivil rights‚Äù violation. This concept of dual sovereigns is way out of line and makes a mockery of double jeopardy clause in the Constitution.  The Founders specifically left policing of crime to the States.

                Purity tests like this are a classic mistake the Right makes.Paul said in Romans 3:23, ‚ÄúAll have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.‚ÄùAnd in 1 Timothy, ‚ÄúThe saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. And I am the foremost of sinners‚ÄùHumans are going to human. They‚Äôre going to make mistakes. They‚Äôre going to fall short of their ideals. They are sometimes going to do wrong.When those of us who have standards seek to topple those on the Right for hypocrisy, we‚Äôre competing against figures on the left who don‚Äôt actually have any standards beyond themselves, and who are therefore immune to charges of hypocrisy. So we lose.As Alistair Crowley sad ‚Äú‚ÄòDo as thou wilt‚Äô is the whole of the law.‚ÄùIronically, the rise of woke religion and its ever-raising stakes is the first time many leftists have somehow found themselves being deposed for sinning. ‚ÄúEating their own,‚Äù as we call it.Let them do that. Don‚Äôt do it on the right.

                Well, it‚Äôs in German for one thing (‚Äúueber die heide‚Äù is ‚Äúover/through the fields‚Äù ‚Ä¶ my German was never as good as my Russian), and one normally doesn‚Äôt hear the Soviet/Russian marching song sung by a clear-voiced woman. If it‚Äôs a German version of the Russian song there may have been some liberties taken with the lyrics.Of course I could just be wrong. Or maybe we‚Äôre thinking of different songs of that title? Search engines show one song by that title from South Africa, which I‚Äôm guessing is not the one in question.In any case, I‚Äôd like to identify that piece of bumper musing well enough to find a copy.

                The cream de la cream of negroes, in South African Universities average 84 basis points.‚Äù The difference in mean test scores of African and White, and of male and female university students in South Africa on the untimed SPMs corroborate the previously found group differences reviewed in the Introduction. With Africans and Whites averaging Raven‚Äôs scores at the 14th and 61st percentiles, respectively, Whites average 1 to 2 SD higher than Africans. (The IQ equivalents are 84 and 105, respectively.) Men also averaged slightly higher than did women.‚Äùp.260https://philipperushton.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/iq-race-south-africa-rushton-intelligence-1112-2000.pdf

            The top 10% of a Normal distribution is 1.28 standard deviations. Assuming their I.Q. is Normal, with mean 85 and standard deviation 15, that translates to 104.That compares to around 119 for the top 10% for Whites. To put that in perspective, that‚Äôs the I.Q. we expect from attorneys, research analysts, executives, auditors, and the like.This number is reached by slightly more than 1.1% of blacks (it‚Äôs 2.28 standard deviations for them, so it‚Äôs a very tall order). For the black talented tenth, their abilities are on line with occupations like sales, computer operator, bookkeeper, assistant manager, secretary. That is, they throw out bookkeepers like Whites throw out research analysts.There is literally nothing a person with an I.Q. of less than around 83 can do in a modern economy. Not dishwasher, not trash man ‚Äì nothing. And, as this is right at the mean I.Q. for blacks, it is immediately obvious that right around 50% of blacks are capable of literally no work at all in a modern economy.

        There was some talk about the commentators here being lynched later for not saying the right things about the dindus.Well, to keep myself safe ‚Ä¶BLACK LIVES MATTER, to someone someplace but I have no clue who, where or why. After all, black thugs are a dime a dozen.Now, before you think that was meant in jest I protest that it is the best reply I have for those that were saying that if a man lies down with a monkey that two monkeys get up. I detest those who make fun of monkeys. They are creations of God. (maybe not his best work, but who am I to judge?)

            Electricity always wants to go to ground. If it‚Äôs already there, humans standing on top of the ground are very poor conductors: there‚Äôs no reason for the electricity to utilize them as a path.If the electricity is some sort of high-powered static charge in the air, then humans might be one of the many (though certainly not the most optimal) paths chosen for the charge to release itself ‚Äî metal posts and poles, buildings, etc. would be the preferred paths. That‚Äôs basically man-made lightning.

                        That won‚Äôt really do anything. Most depictions of that are as much sheer Hollywood as the ubiquitous ‚ÄúWe have to get the bullet out!‚Äù back room surgery scene. (No, you most certainly don‚Äôt have to get the bullet out, and digging around blindly with a pair of pliers or hemostats looking for it will almost certainly do more damage than the bullet did by itself. That‚Äôs what killed President Garfield.)It works for small amounts of water, because the electricity stays on the surface of the water (while trying to seek a ground), but as the size of the area increases, you need an exponentially larger electrical charge to have the same effect.Everything that‚Äôs around you that‚Äôs a better ground than you diminishes that effect.

                                I briefly scanned the posts here on electrically shocking crowds.The military does have a microwave system that can project waves at crowds that depending on the intensity can cause pain, nausea, and vomiting.They set one of them up across the bay in San Diego around the times of the Tea Party protests. The Union did a not-negative piece on it at the time.  But that‚Äôs when the possible targets were largely old white grannies and grandpas. Now they would shriek at the thought of deploying a device for rioters (er, I mean, protestors)

                    Metal in your body, unless it spans your entire body, does not make you a better conductor of electricity to the ground than you normally are. I‚Äôve got a couple plates in my ankle ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt make me more subject to electrocution. I mean, maybe if you could get people to walk around with 10-foot-tall poles sticking out of them, it would make them more likely to attract lightning, but beyond that, no.

                Nicola Tesla certainly could have built a small-scale lightning generator. He probably did üôÇ His talents were better used in other pursuits, like inventing alternating current. Striking someone dead with lightning sounds great in a story, but it is not realistically within Man‚Äôs power (pardon the pun.) And even if possible, extremely inefficient. Consider that the average bolt of lightning has enough electricity to power your all-electric home for about a month! (+/-)

        Aaaand, the alt-white cucks return to suck on Xi‚Äôs dick again. Even if China opened immigration, no one is wanting to go to China. China is a polluted overcrowded shithole with a per capita income around that of Mexico. All the wealthy Chinese want out of China.What is with the Whites Xenophilia? The goodwhites have a hard on for Blacks and the alt-white a hard on for the Chicoms. At least the Blacks have big Johnsons, so the goodwhites hard-on is understandable.

            Some people are planning an exit strategy because the situation here is trending in the wrong direction.  The idea of having a White area of this country doesn‚Äôt prevent more massive wealth redistribution (they‚Äôre coming after our 401k plans) and constant underwriting of failed cities.

I went to see a guy doing an experimental therapy for my condition, Dr. Noah Judenreich.  I‚Äôm so happy now.  I joined the Democratic party, burned my Klan card and signed up on the Daily Kos.
