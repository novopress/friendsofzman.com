“Transmit the values”, lotsa luck. Why on earth would those folks latch onto the incomprehensible, alien values of the losing side’s helots? The white ruling class loathes and ridicules western values, except the few they can use as weapons against other westerners. But even the nutty values of the doomed white ruling class only get lip service at best from African- and Latin-Americans. That won’t last.
We’ll see how the trannies fare in the glorious nonwhite future. For example. Care to place any bets?
Not that anybody, anywhere, honestly cares.

        I’m not into identity/group politics myself. You do your cultural thing, I’ll do mine, as long as we can come together in the public sphere and be Americans. I do sympathize with the “white culturists”. Although I think they would have more adherents to their viewpoint if their focus was more on the ideas of the values and accomplishments of Western Civilization, rather than on the whiteness of the people responsible for it. And yes, I do know history, and know that Western Civilization is largely a history of white European achievement, a history that deserves to be celebrated, a culture that represents the best in human achievement thus far. Still, you can’t change demographics. We are becoming a nation of fewer whites, more  other-than-whites, and not much is going to change this. How we can transmit the values of Western Civilization without alienating non-whites will be one of the nation’s biggest challenges going forward. We won’t be able to do this when nitwits cry “racist” at every turn.
