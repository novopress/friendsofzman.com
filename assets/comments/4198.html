        The rant is right – shunning people because they are wired to like members of their own gender is wrong. Nobody would choose to be gay if they had a choice. Churches better adapt or die.

            The Church does not need to adapt to the world. It is the world which must adapt to the message of the Church.There are still a few Christians like me who refuse to surrender and will not compromise, and we are not afraid. All they can do is kill us, and if they do, fine. Martyrs are saints and go straight to Heaven without suffering in Purgatory.Yes, they can kill us, but the Church can never die. Antichrists from Nero to Napoleon have tried to kill the Church. If real tyrants like Nero and Napoleon failed, it’s a cinch that these two-bit, comic-opera persecutors will fail, too.  Those people and institutions that have tried to kill the Church are all dead. The Church is still here.i am not afraid of these sawed-off Jacobins. Persecution? Bring it on. It is a privilege to suffer for the sake of Truth. And the truth is that homosexuality is a filthy perversion of nature that should be outlawed. That is what the Church has always taught, and even the Pope himself can’t change it.

            “Adapt or you will murder them” is closer to the truth. And by “adapt” you mean commit suicide.

Nobody chooses mental illness.

Sounds kinda homophobic to me.

        Religion will survive.  It’s like when the Greeks moved into the Levant big time in the wake of Alex the Great.  If you were a Jew, it was all very tempting.  Drama, comedy, drink, bloodsport, the academies, symposia, flute girls, infanticide, inexpensive sex with catamites and pornoi (“Dad, I want to cash in my birthright now!…” hey, where have I read that before?).  What’s not to like?  Hell, sounds like today, except the flute girls have traded in music for pole dancing and since we don’t lock up our wives like the Greeks did, swinging adds a whole new dimension.When you look at the Maccabean revolution, it went from propaganda of the deed, through all three phases of theMaoist insurgency model, to military and political victory in about four years.I don’t think that the elites can abandon the Gramscian control model easily because it has worked so damn well for them.  I’m not saying that they can’t coopt urban police departments, urban Methodist ministers, or urban militia units.  I just think that their writ would extend about as far from the cities as the Seleucid’s did from the polis.Besides with with the breakdown of mass media, the pendulum swings back from Gramscian control towards something that might look more like the Ottoman millets (just a guess) but with control extending down from the executive through identity groups (instead of ethic groups) to families or individuals.

        Mr Wilson: The muslims are our friends, okay? They do not need anything run by them lest they get upset.
Of course, when The Geys Of Borg do eventually meet The Religion Of Pieces then there will have to be some serious discussions and compromises to be made. Will be interesting who gives what and how quickly.

        Well, yeah. The Borg don’t run that shit by Muslims, do they? Ever.
A civil right will have no civil rights, and deserves none.
