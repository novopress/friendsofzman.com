        I’m starting to feel a bit better because Trump appears to have learned alot over the past 5 years about realpolitik and deep state machinations. So far he’s not acting like the AIPAC lackey he campaigned as but as the textbook corporate “disrupter”. The high speed activity is critical because he’s got less than 18 months before the Cuckpublicans surrender one house of Congress to the Dems so as to maintain “muh conservative values”

                    There is nothing the cucks love more than being the opposition.  This way they can cluck and crow about their conservative values without having to actually do anything to promote and defend those “values.”  Their voting record is perfect when their vote doesn’t matter.  The second their vote actually matters and is the difference between a pass and a fail, they cuck and vote with the left.

            Trump seems to be anticipating this, too. He has already made some announcements about 2026. And I think we’re going to see policing of those elections that will make shenanigans very risky.
The Senate is now safe.  McConnell’s temper tantrums illustrate this.  He not only failed to stop anyone, he went over and shook hands with Democrats afterwards.  That puts all Republicans in a very bad position in terms of opposing Trump.

        People respond to energy and will. That’s why black people gravitate towards preacher-men. It’s why Jews gravitate towards David O. Selznick types. It’s why Italians love gesticulating dictators, why Germans love self-satisfied ideologues, and why Latins and Middle Easterners like hairy men in flashy uniforms. Anglos, for their part, gravitate towards witty and industrious men who are one part intellectual and one part drinking buddy.Trump is of course the Anglo ideal. That alone will carry him forward, and possibly revolutionize the system behind him. For too long I’ve been seeing weenies on my TV, procedural mandarins with the testosterone of a school librarian. They even fight wars like girls…by being passive-aggressive. Better to manage The Narrative than declare war like a man. Kamala would have color-revolutioned Panama to get the canal…does anyone doubt that Trump might just fucking take it? That is glorious, and it’s why the Sea Peoples are remembered and the Hittite Empire isn’t.Hopefully Europe will grow a pair and be the terrifying continent it once was.

        Back in 2015 got seated next to a director at a Board dinner who’d been the senior workout guy at Citi in the way back.  He got handed one of Trump’s casino messes to manage and found exactly this.  Trump had his guys negotiating with line bankers while he dropped bombs on every executive level Citi guy he could reach.  By time it was done Trump had senior secured rates and terms without the loans truly being either senior or fully secured and with minimal default rights to Citi.  Larry hated Trump, but grudgingly admired how they’d been outmaneuvered.

        Trump is not interested in regime change in Moscow or Beijing.But Trump is clearly interested in regime change in Ottawa, Mexico City, Berlin, Paris, and London.  It is an America First variation of Clean Break.Regarding the UK, Trump ought to deport the ginger bastard, refuse to receive Starmer’s degenerate, non-Anglo ambassador, and should call on (and call out) King Charles to dissolve parliament so that a truly representative government can be elected, lest the “special relationship” end.The Windsors should have been hanged decades ago, but perhaps they are not completely useless.  There will be impotent outrage, as there was in Canuckistan.  But eventually the actual rulers of England will see that sailing with this new wind is wiser than trying to tack into it.

        The Chernobyl false flag was so pathetic, even the msm could only bring themselves to talk about it for a few hours before it was down the memory hole. Simultaneously, they suppressed a story about a grieving Ukrainian mom who, with an IED on her person, blew up some army recruiters. In the very few places where it was reported, it was claimed that she was tricked by Russians into doing it, but if that were the truth, then why suppress the story? You’d think they’d want to shine a spotlight on such inhuman Russian treachery.If I know anything about these people, they won’t give up, there will be more psyops, false flags etc. No longer paid for by USAID, but the Euro intel services presumably still have some money.

        I hardly carry a brief for the “Biden” Administration, but the European leadership’s response to winding down Ukraine has been eye-opening. The homosexuals and women, both those with and those without penises, who run the EU are emotive and hysterical (in fairness, these types litter the American power structure, too, but are on their back heel). This type of uber feminism can lead to lashing out and in this instance world war. Besides the grift, True Believers, and the always-present neocon hand, the last administration knew they had to walk a fine line to avoid an all-out war and even worse bloodshed. Again, dark motives and other reasons were at play, but placating the psychopathic European leadership loomed large.The bottom line is the post-World War II consensus is ending. With hope and luck this may lead to a normalization of relations between Europe and America and elevate both peoples. Estrogen-drenched managers continue to infest the United States, but at least they are being pushed back. The same may happen in time with Europe, although I’m most concerned about Britain of all places.Some time ago Putin said he anticipated a restoration of relations with the United States but was skeptical of the same with Europe due to its leadership. This makes crystal clear sense now. And as a final note of caution, women scorned and all that makes this a precarious moment because the Euro Girl Bosses may lash out if they can’t have their precious. Let’s hope that’s not the case.

            The only effective lashing out they could do would be to attempt a nuclear false flag. Judging from the pathetic recent Chernobyl false flag, I’d say they don’t have the stomach for it. Otherwise they have nothing to lash out with.

            It’s amazing that this generation of Euro leaders has chosen Ukraine as their hill upon which to die. People complain about Technocrats here, but those of us old heads have watched the old European Steel &amp; Coal Union trade agreement get old, get a sex change, convert to Islam and become a war-monger. The Technocrats did not do this; it was the politicians.

                Behavior of UK and Poland is not as surprising as Switzerland, Sweden, and Finland choosing this, of all causes, to give up their neutrality. That’s something you can only do once. At first I typed cash in rather than give up, but then realized they don’t even have that justification for doing it. Rather the contrary.

                Consciously or not, the hill Euro leaders (and their American counterparts) chose to die on was demographics. Rushing headlong into stupid and catastrophic war was a secondary effect of the first. But, yeah, it was not the technocrats but the duly elected and unelected leadership that decided to commit suicide. The bawling German minister at the ludicrous “security conference” is the ultimate symbol of the pathological narcissism that led to this point.

            Looking forward, let’s not forget that any treaties concluded by Trump will need to be ratified by a 2/3rds vote in the Senate.
Can you imagine chickenhawks like Lindsey Graham or Roger Wicker ever voting for anything other than “More War!”?
Trump surely knows this, so I doubt any formal treaties will be agreed upon.

            It is a great point JD.  You always hear from the EU types that after Ukraine the Russians will push on to Paris, if not London.  Of course no evidence for this can be presented.

            It’s more than the Euro oligarchs. I got into with a Dutch relative of mine on social media and he became hysterical and abusive when I maintained that Ukraine could not win this war, had hundreds of thousands of casualties and we needed to negotiate with Russia to end the war before any more Ukrainians died.

        Great insights on the replacement of proxies and committees with direct connections with real power. I can’t help but think of what Zelensky was doing before he was made head of the Maidan Regime. That was foisted here with Admiral Levine.It may turn out that Covid was a solvency crisis that was also used to install permanent Managerialism which is really permanent Parasitism.It is probably critical to the survival of The West to normalize relations with Russia and bring them in as a partner. The, “alliances”, and strategy of the past 40 years such that they got gamed by China and now Russia. It may turn out that rather than encircling Russia and empowering China nearly destroyed The West.I am curious to see the longer term ramifications of all of the shocking discoveries that DOGE is making. The fraud and economic malfeasance are getting the headlines. However, real people committed those crimes and they are being traced and seen by other real people. That is where things get very interesting. What will Musk, Big Balls and others do with the knowledge not just of how much was wasted but by who and to what real ends.As usual, mass deportations. That is the critical matter right now is mass deportations.

            Yes. The bottom line is the well-being of White people. Dismantling the massive graft and ending the Ukraine war are good on both fronts even though it is late in the day. I continue to worry about Our Greatest Ally provoking a war that leads to the slaughter of White American men. Israel has lost tons of goodwill and even the well-bribed American establishment may be a little tepid about going to war for them. Let’s hope.

                “I continue to worry about Our Greatest Ally provoking a war that leads to the slaughter of White American men. ”If the Ukraine didn’t provoke this, the woes of Our Greatest Ally (TM) certainly won’t. War is a funny thing, fought by the elites and the plebs together. The government in the US was particularly aware of that dynamic. Our entrance into both phases of the Great War required a rallying event (Lusitania, Pearl Harbor). The Great War also required a lot of farm boys from large families, healthy and used to heavy labor at young ages.If there is an upside to the sickest, out of shape, mental depressed/despairing, unhappiest set of generations in perhaps centuries is that there is no will in the plebs to go to war. The blanket propaganda at the beginning of the Ukraine conflict was a hope that there was some taste for war left in the populace. There was not.Yes, you can draft young men and even young women in a pinch. But also no, they have to be volunteers at some level to be effective soldiers. My healthy military age son I would encourage to take any loophole to avoid fighting in a modern war, short of an honest border war in the US. I highly doubt a WWI or WWII mama would be thinking along those lines.Between the small families, health issues, and lack of honor/duty culture there’s no gas in the tank for large conventional armies left. Draft all you like, and even with threat of prison time. Boomer evangelicals may love their idea of defending their greatest ally. Their skeptical grandchildren will not. It is the later that have to do the fighting and dying.I tend to believe that the elites know all of the above too, which is why they haven’t even bothered with a draft.

        It’s about to get a lot worse for them.First, Trump is going straight to SCOTUS – his peer in the Constitutional system.  The lower court shenanigans likely get shut down.Second, DOGE is uncovering obvious fraud, money laundering, racketeering, etc.  Many of the loudest screamers stand a chance of being perp walked.Third, those speeches by Vance and Hegseth were not meant just for the EU elites.  They were messages to the MEGA population in Europe which hates the immigration crap and the Oceana that Western Europe has become.  Changes in governments will be in the Trump agenda.Fourth, Trump appears likely to flip the script with Russia.  Imagine a framework that prohibits NATO expansion in Eastern Europe.  And one that leads to a full accounting and accountability for the Americans and Europeans who got a million people killed in Ukraine, bombed Nordstream, the Moscow Opera, and launched American theater ballistic missiles into Russia…There is no defense against those things.

        We still haven’t figured out Trump’s true position on the JQ yet, though. Ukraine was a Jewish neocon project, and clearly he’s bringing that to an end. He has talked a lot of shit on Iran and Gaza but nonetheless seems to be wary of Netanyahu and wary of getting sucked into Israel’s Zionist expansionism.Normalization of relations with Russia also brings normalization with the country that supported Israel’s enemy Syria.So, on the one hand, while Trump’s administration appears to be staffed with rabid Zionists, the actual policy of the administration so far seems markedly different than  Biden administration, which was clearly serving Jewish interests above all else.

            If the Jews are America-first, then Trump likes them. I assume this is his stance for any non-white person, and most white Americans’ stance in general. This is my stance BTW. Obviously you judge someone on their deeds not their words, but if they’re being bent to your ideology, that’s a good thing by itself.And the JQ is not long for this world. By the end of this century, talking crazy about the Jews will be like those people who blamed the Freemasons and The Vatican for everything. The Jews had their 20th Century, and now it is fading away. There will be new Huns to battle in the coming decades.

                    Zionists put Trump in the White House. That’s politics. He’s going to support them for the most part. Plus, boomers like him love Israel. But his deeds suggest he’s for Semitic peace and commerce, not Semitic gay race communism. (BTW the conservative Saudis have given him lots of money too.) Zionists want what’s good for Israel only, which is understandable. Then there’s the frizzy-haired pro-Gaza lesbian Rachels who treat every home society like a college campus. These people are being decimated, and that’s good enough for me.I think deporting illegals, auditing the MIC, and taking a stand against anti-White and anti-Nativist legislation is good action, no? I would say that’s America First. I would certainly not poo-poo what is most definitely  a great timeline because Trump wants to give Israel a smooch every now and then.

                How many Jews are truly America-first versus America-first until it becomes meet to drop the mask and revert to, Is it good for the Jews? Now there are some Jews who are bona fide AINO patriots (for what that’s worth)–I know one. But the vast majority of them hold allegiance to their tribe and their tribe only.

                    Trump doesn’t strike me as philosopher on that point. He’s certainly hung out with enough Jews to know their character. If they seem AINO patriots, he’ll work that.

                If the Jews are America-first
But that’s the problem – you can never know if a particular jew is America First until it conflicts with israel first.  5.99 million out of 6 M times, israel first will win that conflict, ergo, they are NOT America first.  Just look at L’il Bennie Shapiro.
And the bigger problem is I have yet to find where israel’s interests are America’s interests.

                    I have alotof personal experience with Jews. I’d guess that 20% of Jews would be America first vis a vis Israel, and twice that among younger Jews. Which would still land us in the same unfortunate place as your tiny fraction estimate when real war broke out.

                “And the JQ is not long for this world. By the end of this century, talking crazy about the Jews will be like those people ”Yes, I agree with this. Neo-nazis talking points might become very dated in their lifetime. Gen Z and later does not have anything invested in the “Nazi” genre of argument, other than some enforced education from a lack luster to outright hated school experience. Any sort of practical turn of mind suggests that Caucasians at large will not be excited to pretend to be Germans from the 1930’s under an authoritarian government running a social experiment.The only immediate issue is that the suppression of the discussion in the late 20th century is still widely enforced. It makes the subject taboo and somewhat novel/fun. For right now, it will get a lot of mileage from the shiny/new and pearl clutching effect. Beyond there, calm heads will need to figure out what can be done with the information.

            The Netanyahu government is puppeteering President Trump the same as they do the rest of our politicians. That’s why Trump is currently talking up Israel’s latest whacky plan for the Gazans. His sole contribution to the scheme as I see it was to sell Palestinian replacement as a kind of real estate deal. It is a distinction without a difference. Now, if Trump were to internalize such a policy and work for the removal of incompatible ethnic groups from America (like Jews?)—instead of just recycling the Democrat policy from the 1990s of mostly deporting the really bad “criminal” aliens—, I’d be suitably impressed.

WHY is Starmer, assuming he had a capable army, wanting to get the UK involved in this pointless bloodbath in the first place?  How is it in the interest of either the British people or the state?

“Nobody” is doing a lot of work there. The only reason Britain might avoid doing this, and it applies to the United States as well, is that the manpower shortage would require a draft and there would be massive rioting.

        The treatment of Zelensky now reminds me of a 2016 election post mortem I read.  Shortly after the election a group of well connected Never Trumpers had gotten together to discuss how to co-opt the incoming Trump Administration.  Not long after they started Evan McMullin walks in and starts ranting about various topics.  Finally, one of them says, “who invited this guy” and they quietly get rid of him.  Zelensky is the Evan McMullin of Europe. Trump should start calling him that, and we would probably get the war ended sooner.

        Europe is an American colony in the post-World War 2 era.  All one has to do is look at thenumber of U.S. military bases on European soilto understand the dynamic.  They are irrelevant.Re: Ukraine, Zman sees Russia as resistant to the Western-dominated global world order, while I believe Putin is just as much controlled by the higher international financial layers as Trump and the West are, discussedhere.  A couple of years ago the (now imprisoned) Russian dissident Igor Strelkov issued a sharp list of pointed questions about the nature of the so-called war, questions you can seehere.  These questions are *entirely* unanswerable by the “Russia is against the West” side – for example, why did Russia never blow up the Dniper bridges which allowed Ukraine to supply all its forces in East Ukraine?  Why has Russia continued to supply the Ukrainian military with endless oil throughout the duration of the war?  You should really read the Slavsquat link and ponder over these questions.In my opinion, Putin and Zelensky, controlled by international financiers, are workingtogetherto empty out the Slavlands of white Christians through an endless controlled grind-fest.  There are endless reports that Russia sends its soldiers in frontal assaults against the most heavily fortified Ukraine positions.  Furthermore, any agreement between Trump and Putin will be merely a Minsk-3 pause on fighting which allows Ukraine to join the EU and rebuild it’s militarized forces to get ready for further war within Russia itself (see Minsk 1 and 2 agreements, immediately violated).  Putin hopes to ride out his position as a globohomo-lackey until he dies – after which Russia will be dismembered into a dozen pieces for full financial exploitation by the West.I wrote about Ukraine in the following posts:The Ukrainian stalemate: Intentionally planned for ulterior objectivesandHow real is the Russia/Ukraine war?America (and UK’s) interest in keeping Russia and Europe at odds is a long-standing tradition in line with Mackinder’s thesis that only a united Russia/Germany could stave off US/UK domination of the continent, discussedhere.  This is why Nordstream 2 was blown up.

            While some of this is plausible, I’m hardly the first person to predict that whoever comes after Putin will be just as nationalist if not moreso. Seems unlikely he would allow Russia to be carved up. And if that’s the plan, for the Russian leadership to allow this to happen to Russia, why hasn’t Putin allowed it? Why wait for the next guy? Certainly many interests in the west would be happy with him for doing so.

                Agreed. The West had their turkey carvers in Russia in the 90s. Putin sent the ones he liked least packing. Why would he do that if they had what they already wanted? Aside from these plot holes, there is also the issue of cartels gaming accords.Essentially, the entire power structure are cooperating globalists theory amounts to a unified international cartel. That doesn’t say that this structure doesn’t exist. It does. Such accords are subject to exploitation and gaming, and that is perhaps one thing we have witnessed with China and the US and Russia. It was all fine and dandy when they thought China’s coastal elites would be happy and fat satraps administering the Great Han Production Zone. But that table seems to have been overturned as China realized an opportunity. Similarly, the Americans doing the coup in Ukraine was final writing on the wall for Russia.Moreover, you have Imperial Court stenographers and propagandists like G. Friedman advocating for GAE full spectrum dominance with Russia/Ukraine the next stop on the docket and insulting the Chinese as content to be satraps.I am sure there are tensions within Russia, but Putin grinding up soldiers just because he wants to in order to appease some financier sounds a little too cartoonish and Marvel/Hollywood to be plausible.My money is on history has now resumed and neo-liberal globalism has crashed onto those rocks of reality.

        The Sea Peoples analogy is a good one. The Bronze Age palace economies never saw them coming. The Blob made enemies it didn’t know it had.
Still, the devil is in the details. Trump is going to want a meaningful concession from Putin, if only for the sake of his own ego, and Vlad may not be in a generous mood.
And the Eurocrats, utterly controlled by the “City of London”, are insane.

They’re not major anymore. They can be dismissed with contempt by both the USA and Russia. This is part of a very long term process in which the influence and reach of the old European powers has been declining. The decline is on-going.

        Clearly Trump is on a mission. Getting shot in the ear by a rifle bullet traveling 2800 fps will do that to you. And a random head turn is all that kept him from becoming pink mist, so he likely believes God is on his side. Damn-the-torpedoes time. Putin understands this and is covertly helping Trump because he too had to fight and win against his own oligarchs. A deal will be done, and everyone (including Europe) will be the better for it. The neocons killed a million normie white guys in Ukraine. They should pay dearly for that.

        1. You’re talking about Zelensky like the little schlong comedian has any power. He was installed by Victoria Nuland in the gang. He is irrelevant.2. Ukraine really needs to cut away those Catholic provinces in the west. They are the source of all the friction. They are the ones who want to cozy up with the West. Let the West have them.3. Europe is clueless. They had the Great Satan fighting their wars and like-minded people in the Great Satan’s government. Russia is no more going to allow a hostile takeover of Ukraine by the West than we would allow a hostile takeover of Canada by the East. SMH. It was kind of one of these tragedy of the common things. They were pursuing their initiatives on our dime. Now it’s been dumped in their lap.4. I’m still laughing about the stillborn deal Trump had with Zelensky to pay back their debts with rare minerals. If I’m not mistaken, those rare minerals are now back in the hands of mother Russia.

        As for the major powers of Europe, they will eventually play a role in the new security architecture, but they need to join everyone else in the 21st century before that can happen.
Unless Europe kicks out a few million stupid, parasitic, violent migrants, there won’t be any major powers left there to be part of a security architecture. I wish the UK and France would get rid of their nuclear weapons before the Muslims completely take over both countries.

        The USAID and other revelations are showing that politics are all a stage play carefully scripted by players behind the scenes. Right now we are probably in the beginning of Act 2 and don’t know what will happen in Act 3.Two is the more interesting disclosures I have seen in the last week are:1. A lot of the anti islam propaganda in Europe is reportedly funded by the UAE who see Islamicists as a threat.2. Tom Cotton, Mr Conservative, is on the board of a globalist/leftist NGO. Not surprisingly he is trying to sabotage Trump’s pick for under secretary of defense for the crime of opposing the Iraq War.Point being is that it is too early to tell his anything is going to turn out in Europe or the US. However, the Achilles heel of the right is being too optimistic. We get some wins and the right lets its guard down.While Trump is proceeding full stream ahead, in Wisconsin the Democrats are set on winning the open state Supreme Court seat. Their stated goal is to gerrymander more Democrat congressional seats so they can impeach Trump. Fortunately the guy who runs the persistence is working to try and make sure that doesn’t happen. The Democrats are using abortion to drive female voters which works in the midterms more that presidential elections.So who knows what will happen but the minute the right gets distracted, the left is  ready to pounce.

        “…the sooner there are elections, the sooner the world is free of the little green man [ Zelensky ] who has held the West captive for three years.”This may be a cavil on my part but this is a rare example of Z not not labeling things as they are. Zelensky was at best a figurehead, a puppet played by our so-called neocons. In any just world, those people would would have already faced the firing squad or be hanging at the end of a rope. That’s probably too much to wish for. How do we remove such behind the scenes people and most importantly assure that such abuses of power will not happen again?

        The Vance speech was an odd moment. It suggests that someone in the administrationreallyunderstands the EU (because whoever it is agrees with me): NATO “geopolitical” postures are, no matter what actual war-like events may arise from them (they don’t care), matters of domestic repression.Not true of the neocons, though they do enjoy wartime speech restrictions, and they make sure it’s always wartime. What theyreallywant is to see the dead citizen number go up, and the rest is secondary—orfun.But the political layer of the EU, the visible managerial face of intelligence/business/etc., wants only obedience—atotal showof obedience. Our Democracy™ is theirGesamtkunstwerk. Vance went off-topic—regime fans have complained—to rejectthat. It’s that playhouse he threatened to smash, not the military one (not exactly). So, as they have not for the many dead, they cry.If only Vance was a real guy.

            Exactly. Exhibit A is USAID. Remember the criticism of Red China because it charged the family of the executed for the bullet? How is that any different than requiring taxpayers to pay for the rape and murder of their children and their dispossession?

        Mario Draghi blame the concept of nation state cause Europe into failuresits lie because people like Mario Draghi dismantled nation state Europe along with ethnic identity
This traitorous scums hiding fact that people like him hold power and ruin the country and then blame on their own people
lessons we learned is a nation state is the normal state and Country like America is not normal and dysfunctional
normal country should be hung people like Mario Draghi long time ago
