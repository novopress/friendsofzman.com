        But, but, but who then will do all those jobs that Americans (ie., White Americans) supposedly won’t do?  F that lie.  Here’s hoping Trump and Homan mass deport the the hell out of all these illegals, tax any remittances 50% at a minimum and punish Mexico as a co-conspirator and enabler of this disaster.

            Yes, Trump infuriated some of us with his refusal to tax remittances…and now he’s saying he wants lots of H-1Bs…Indians with fake resumes to take American tech jobs (at which they’re not very good usually)…

                H-1b VISA program is too lax wrt proving “need” for foreign workers, in fact it doesn’t.  What it does is “protect” foreign workers from exploitation (more or less).  The thinking being that the only remaining incentive to choose foreign over domestic workers is “availability”.If Trump is serious about immigration—illegal or legal—he will reform this program to require proof of inability to obtain workers who are native born.  Of course, that’s not much of an answer since in high tech areas, we already employ foreign tech based overseas to do work remotely.  Have you ever used a “help” number for any support and *not* gotten “pageet” on the line?

                The boundless love of Elon et al. for the Indians is absolute proof that they don’t give the tiniest shit about getting things done.
“Tech”is done, and they want the least human race to maintain the ruins of it, to the maximum detriment of the rest of us.

Uh, no.
Unfortunately normies won’t realize this until we have 300 foot tall statues of angry Hindu gods in US traffic circles.

                            Speaking of New Jersey, our Hindu friends are now trying to ban Old Glory from town council meetings in Edison.
Yup, just like us.

                            A few years after 9/11, when I was as full of civic national patriotism as I’ve ever been, I was driving through a suburb of San Francisco and saw the construction of a huge mosque. I was thunderstruck.
That may have been the first time that I entertained the idea that our good will and color blindness was weaponized against us and we were fools asking to be subjugated.

                    Civil forfeiture of illegals’ property is in order and doable, and actually would lead to self-deportation. As for these Haitians, most came in (falsely, which is beside the point) under Temporary Protected Status and overstayed. Start taking their stuff along with picking them up for deportation. Word will get out.

                        You live in a fantasy world. Trump will flood the country with “legals” and deport some thousands of the very worst of the illegals.
Does your fantasy view of Trump include his support for red-flag laws and police raids on homes which  have “assault rifles”?

                    They were illegally given Temporary Protected Status, so technically, for up to 18 months, they are eligible to work here. I have no idea if that can be unwound in court, or if we have to take it out on the people who broke the law granting TPS, but if it can be abused that easily, Congress needs to fix it.
Same with the asylum process. Congress can mandate that immigration judges follow the vaguely worded law and not assign dates if the asylee is not a Mexican or Canadian (or, arguably Cuban) citizen, and just stamp it “Denied.”

Don’t you yet understand that even if everyone else on here does the same, it still makes zero difference?
I agree with the endpoint you are seeking. More or less, anyway. I just have yet to see anyone propose a realistic plan to get from point A to point B.

I make small changes in the world all the time, according to what I think best.  Then I let God and his helpers decide what they want to do with it from there.  Sometimes, they make very big things outta small things.
Setting righteous example in the ways you mentioned always has value.

                                It’ll take a leader of resolute strength to secure borders permanently, slash immigration to proven essentials and brutalize remissions.Donald couldn’t do it last time, though  ‘building the wall’ was centerpiece of his agenda and promised administration.It is not always enough to love people.  Sometimes, you must also make them afraid.The best will respond to your love and goodwill and will be already ‘above the law’ in Scriptural terms.  Doing more than the law requires.  These, skim like cream from the brim and retain.The others . . . if you don’t want them destroying you, themselves and the country, they must be intimidated and restrained, I am sorry to say.It’d be lovely and pretty if Everybody Was Just Wonderful and republic this and democracy that, but everybody is not wonderful and it takes a strong hand.

                The factory owner in Ohio who was raving about the Hatians he was hiring should be included in first wave of mass deportations.
No. Deportations are for children who were either born here or brought across illegally while they were still minors. There is already a different legal process available for dealing with traitors.

                    Yes, but the same place that laid out punishment for traitors also defines traitor. We have a great plenty of undeclared “wars” going on. We don’t need to strain it there, too.
Ideally, that business should be met by state laws or better yet local ordinances. Don’t bring trouble to Springfield. If you want a bunch of Haitians working for you, take your business to Haiti.

                Yep. Haitian savages are going to behave like Haitian savages. What do you expect? But the white man who enables the savagery is a treasonous mutant–and also a greedy pig–and deserves horrific punishment. Deportation to Port-au-Prince might be just the thing provided you also break a few of his bones before doing so.

                    In Indiana the AG is investigating how the Haitians ended up in Logansport working in a Tyson poultry plant. As part of his ongoing investigation it was discovered that upwards of 28+ foreign languages are being spoken in most Indiana public schools unbeknownst to local communities. The kids didn’t want to tell their parents about what was happening and the white women on the school board think its wonderful that African men are wandering the halls of the local high school.

                In a short interview clip, the business owner explained he’s on some program where he gets to pay the Haitians below minimum wage and the government makes up the difference plus incentives. They get some weird ‘temporary’ visa (there are how many of those? 43 or more?). As well, the mayor owns a bunch of the houses they rent at higher-than-normal prices, another government program.

                    Saw that clip. What a bastard. Same with the mayor. They don’t have an “Every. Single. Time.” Early Life; they have worse — registered Demoncraps.
There are at least 300,000 Haitians with TPS at the moment, and Mayorkas just extended it. In order to qualify for TPS, the law says they have to already be here on a visa when the war or tyranny broke out. Since they were not, every one of them required an illegal act from at least Mayorkas on down. Throw them all in prison.

        I drove up to a large construction site last week in my white company truck for work (civil engineer). ALL of the unskilled labor for the last decade (or more) has been Central and South Americans that are paid cash. Concrete, roofing, painting, and general labor is damn near 100% illegal alien. There’s always one that speaks English that runs the daily pool of illegals and likely has a green card. They all scattered to the edges on the job site when I drove up except the one English speaker who was busy yelling at them that I wasn’t immigration. I haven’t seen this kind of behavior since the 90s.

                When I started in the mid-90s all of that work was done by either black males or young, just starting out, White males. It was always fun watching some 50-year-old black guy giving some 19-year-old White dude a complete rash and a $hit for screwing something up. In my area there’s a third-generation+ black family masonry company that does some of the best brick work I’ve ever seen. Went on a job site a couple of years ago and they’ve got some White kid working/training with them. I asked where the hell did they find the kid. “Shiiiit, day is White boys errywhere”. Poor kid was getting the business, but taking it like a champ.

                Just finished having the house reroofed.  Same here, all Hispanic workers fronted by a White guy.  These workers, IA’s or not, are simply subpar wrt skill sets and conscientiousness.  This of course goes along with HBD understanding of race.
There simply are *no* alternatives in my area.  Any White roofing company is put out of business by these type of entities.  Having close interaction this last couple of weeks, I’m convinced these guys mean well and do their best (damn hot work), but that doesn’t cut it.

                    Years ago I was in the same boat, hire the IA’s or … DIY. I had done some roofing in the past, and my house has a shallow roof so took on the job. This is years ago, so they had asserted selves in my area 15+ years backWhat I needed was someone to get the shingles UP to the roof. So I get this guy off the side of the road, young, maybe 18-20. Have him on the roof, and find out he has NO IDEA WHATSOEVER how measuring works. Like, not even the concept.This aboriginal human received a lesson in what a measurement is, and after that day sent him packing with his pocket of my money and deli sandwich. That is the last time I ever would have one of these people on my property. Finished the rest of that, and many other jobs, myself.And I shit you not – this guy did not understand the basic concepts and it was not language. Just dumb.

                        If you are in Australia, this makes perfect sense. Africans are geniuses next to aborigines.  They run public service bulletins in Australia about not sleeping on the road and the infamous don’t sniff the petrol song.
Africans have a similar problem, just not as bad.  I don’t know how aborigines compare to smaller African groups like Pygmies though.  AFAIK, the Bantu in Africa treat them horribly, so they may very well be dumber than Aborigines.

                    Let’s also be honest. Putting on a residential roof is a simple job, but not everybody is willing to risk working sometimes up to 30 or 40 feet up in the air. Scabs putting on a roofs are expensive enough. Can you imagine what it would cost with American labor?

                            Have you looked at the price of shingles lately? The cheapo 3-tab stuff is $120/square. Plus barrier and tar paper plus vent plus starter plus… A dinky 1000 square foot starter with a simple roofline is at least $15 grand just in materials. Goes up fast if you want something more than a 10- or 15- year shingle.

                                120 a square times 10 squares (1000 sq ft) plus let’s say double that for underlayment, some vent patches etc is $2400 bucks not 15 grand.   double that for labor you’re at about $5000.  NOT  $15,000 that they are charging
and just paying the IA contractors (not employees0 half or less.  (which covers the 5 grand)

                                    Probably 15 squares, assuming a sloped roof. But you are right that I WAY overestimated. I shouldn’t do multiplication in my head. I’d be shocked if your materials came to less than $5k, though.
I have no idea why you are getting bills for $40k in your area. I have a monster house with an extremely complex roof and had it redone during COVID for around $18k. I know the owner of the company made almost nothing on the job, but he got to redo the business roof, too, where he did OK.

                        Oh, I see the downvoters are back out. What’s so hard about pulling off old shingles and stapling some tar paper and new shingles on? It isn’t rocket science. The only thing that would be difficult is if your roof pitches are pretty steep or if you’ve got some kind of intricate roof design. If you aren’t sure about things like flashing, after watching a YouTube video you should be able to figure it out.

                            It’s easy enough if it is a simple, symmetrical 4/12 ranch with a gable on each end and a ridge vent. I’ve done those singlehandedly.Add in hips, valleys, dormers, chimneys, weird or old architecture, and 2-3 stories of height and a non-walkable pitch and it becomes significantly more difficult.If it were easy, roofs would never leak.The other thing of course is that time is money, so the crews are always being driven to work as fast as they can so they can move on to the next job. If the company prioritizes speed over quality (and many do) the customer is going to get a shitty job.

                            I used to have a buddy that did roofing.  It’s backbreaking work made even more brutal in the spring, summer and fall.  When he first started when he was young, it was his job to carry buckets of steaming hot pitch up and down ladders all day (most of his work was in the city where nearly all roofs are flat, not shingled).  Their knees give out in their 50s. Their hands are never clean.  They look 10 years older than they are.A different guy I know went into HVAC. He worked in it over the winter and come spring, he was on the roof of a large office building 3 days in a row.  This was his first spring in the field. He got sun poisoning so bad he had to go the burn center for weeks. He had to get scraped down in that burn center. He was out of work for months. He said it was the worst pain he ever had in his life.There is no amount of money you could pay me to do roofing.  I did hard work right out of high school. I absolutely hated school and had no intention of ever setting foot in a classroom ever again (I was a minority from 7th grade on).   Learned my lesson quick. Went back to school. Work in air conditioning.

                                Right, I guess I should have clarified. What I meant was that there is nothing about installing a roof that you need a lot of technical expertise. It’s more of an issue of what you guys are saying (opportunity cost, physical labor, avoiding risk of hurting yourself, etc.) That’s why most people won’t do themselves what is technically doable.
Working it as a way to earn a living is another thing altogether.

                    Mestizo labor built all of the suburban mcmansions in the DFW ‘burb where we used to live.  Not one window, door, or even electric outlet in the wall was cut square.  Not one.  And we had themreinstall the sheet vinyl in the kitchen (this was 30 years ago) three times and it still had odd cuts and seams.  And friends with houses 10 years newer with a higher level of finish (and even higher price tags) had the exact same issues.

                    I did some of that work in the 1990s when I was in grad school. Worked for a small contractor, did some roofing, framing, and general labor. I was good at it and enjoyed it but I was getting $7 an hour under the table. There was simply not enough money in it back then. The guys I worked for made an OK living, but they weren’t rich, that’s for sure. I remember an independent electrician on one of our jobs back in ’93 or ’94 who was probably over fifty at the time stating that he charged $25 an hour. That sounded like a fortune to me. An independent mason who had his own family business had a hard time making ends meet, when some contractor in North Carolina offered him $25 an hour and steady work, he and his son packed up and left as soon as they could and never looked back.Around here there are very few to no illegals in construction, thirty years later I still see white guys framing houses in the snow, and shitty, rusted-out trucks parked out front. They’re still not getting rich unless they’re in a union and doing government work.Using illegals in construction is nothing but pure greed by the contractors, if white guys could make a decent wage, get decent benefits, and have steady work, they would do it. Like every other industry, contracting is based on the exploitation of labor, and the people who do the least actual hard work, like the general contractors and the real estate agents, make the most money.Now the industry is all butthurt because they can’t find anyone willing, competent, or qualified, and they are raising wages and hiring like mad, but they drove all the white guys out years ago and there’s no on left but the Mexicans willing to do it.

                    Back in the 70s I would work with my painting contractor brother-in-law. I remember one job site where a white electrician would demonstrate to a dozen or so Hispanics how to install an electrical outlet. They would then spread out and attempt to install them properly (this was in California). Quality work guaranteed (sarcasm alert).

            I am having siding and trim replaced on the house.  The contractor is a local guy with two young white guys, also locals, working with him.  They are doing OK work but, damn they are slow.  Some scumbag with a crew of Hondurans would have had it done two weeks ago.

        At an end of season event for my son’s sports team in the deep red state where I live, much of the conversation was celebrating Trump’s victory.One guy with a son in college and two in high school was talking about ‘legal’ immigration, though. Apparently, he’s a computer engineer who hires tons of dot Indians to work for his company. It was pretty extraordinary to be in a room surrounded by families of young white men who will be searching for work in the very near future and listen to him talk about being a Trump supporter in favor of legal immigration. He fully supports legally making it impossible for his own sons to find employment and livelihoods in a country which was built for them by their ancestors.

            It is a crazy thing, isn’t it. I recently lost my patience with this and said, “maybe think about someone other than  yourself for a change.” The guy was poleaxed so I preceded to explain how him gaming the system for a quick buck is immiserating the rest if the country. He did not like hearing that he was not the hero of his tale, so maybe it worked, but I doubt I ever see him again as a result.

                What you told him gets to the good guy-bad guy narrative.  Immigration, including legal, needs to be framed as immoral.  The standard “illegal bad, legal good” popular with conservatives should always be called out.

                    Politics is about morality, not facts and reason. Whenever I point out the immorality of immigration on twitter, I am gratified to see more than a few replies indicating a light went on. White people are tuned to want to do the right thing. European societies are moral societies. Get the morality right and you win the political argument.You see this with the gun issue. The gun rights people never fell for traps about crime, hunting or suicide. They hammered away at the immorality of disarming people and won the fight. People now laugh at gun grabbers, because gun grabbers are so obtuse they cannot see the moral absurdity of their claims.

                        “They hammered away at the immorality of disarming people and won the fight.”Yes, that is correct essentially, morality as in self defense was at the core, but where gun rights are now was a gradual process spanning a generation. The rights you talk about, nowhere I can think of, happen all at once!Gun rights was a process of baby steps. I’ve outlined that here. In AZ, of which I am more than acquainted, the process took decades—and that was in a fairly conservative State. It was not over in 1995 when we passed concealed carry. It was the major breakthrough to be sure, but the right to carry a firearm does not entail the ability to use such—nor should it come at the whim of the State (i.e., a State granted license).We had to fight for “stand your ground” laws, the assumption of innocence in defensive use, and even had to pass legislation outlining what offenses deadly force could be used in outside of fear for life and severe bodily harm.All the time we pointed to the growing record of legitimate use of firearms when the opposition predicted mayhem and Dodge City like shootouts.Baby Steps. We knew all the time that concealed carry was not the end game, it was not even considered an acceptable alternative to the status quo of the time. It was but a first step of a long term plan to achieve “Constitutional Carry”—and we were the first.Similarly, true progress in immigration reform will only occur with such long term thinking. Find the weak spots, chip at them, accept what you must, then work for more.

                        Yes, that’s exactly how to win. For example, the look on the propagandist’s face spoke volumes when Tom Holman told her families wouldn’t be separated because the kids would go back along with the parents. The propagandist obviously is a paid liar but that may never have occurred to her. Zero tolerance and refusing to frame the issue as anything other than immorality is key to prevailing in the argument. And it is an argument worth winning because things can get worse.

I see you haven’t to been to New York California, or Massachusetts  lately, have you, Z? They’ve all told the Supreme Court to fuck off and basically nullified the Second Amendment.
In NY and CA you can’t even buy a box of .22s without permission from the cops.

            Last I read some time ago, New Zealand had immigration such that you were considered wrt your occupation.  If there were too many Software Engineers, then you were out of luck.  However, I heard of a bicycle repair person from the “States” who was admitted and opened up shop there.  We need to have quota limits, but if those limits are greater than “zero”, then we need sensible vetting of the applicant as to what they can provide this country and what this country desires of them.

                    Total rejection of the possible which means what you propose will never occur.In any society, there will be shortfalls of folks educated/proficient in current fields of need.  Always happens.  Hell, we went around Germany *before* the war even ended, grabbing from a list of scientists in fields we wished to pursue as a country when the war ended. We were the better for it.What you do will not fill needs quickly or efficiently.  Whether such is done through immigration or temporary work permission, the country requires such flexibility.  Name a single country in the world where such is not possible.Your thinking makes immigration reform impossible short of an authoritarian regime imposition.

                Now factor in AI which is already damn good a complex coding tasks. I replaced all the contractors I used to employ via UpWork with ChatGPT. Indians are the lowest skilled coders on the market and typically the cheapest which made them popular before AI came along.

                I think it’s mostly that things are not nearly as rosy as Biden says. Engineers aren’t needed if no one has the cash to buy the things from the process streams they design.
Things aren’t down just in the US. Due to a bunch of insane policies, we’ve been able to contract things worldwide.

            “It was pretty extraordinary to be in a room surrounded by families of young white men who will be searching for work in the very near future”You make an assumption that such men (boys) will put in the effort to major in Computer Science.  Perhaps, perhaps not.  Not that Indians are better.  Their coding work has been found lacking, but they are *cheap* and often that fools company HR.  Nothing is cheap, if you need to rewrite it or debug errors after the fact.In general, we as a country don’t get as many folk into STEM fields as other, more hungry nations, but my understanding on this may be old.  The real issue is how do these Indians get hired?  Do they come in on H1-b VISA’s or from remote sites in India?  One has a ready solution, the other perhaps more complicated?

        Biden didn’t open the border. Mayorkas, who has been at Biden’s side as his handler for many long years, dissolved the border and ran an organized global invasion of Our homeland.I think the next step for our politics and our side is to dispense with the illusion that the elected official is the one making the decisions and doing the things. TDS is a sign of that being true as Trump does have his own ideas and he wasn’t bought in ’16. In any case, the elected official is a front for the appointed officials who are emissaries of the donors.The next step is for Tucker and as yet unknown Internet era mediamen to do exposees and always say the name of the emmissary and the donor.Mayorkas dissolved the border. Mayorkas and HIAS organized and carried out a mass invasion and settler colonial project via air, sea and land – a crime against the American people and the country.I never want to hear Biden’s name again. I want to hear the names of his cabinet, their deputies and the other appointees and their donors. It is time to name them all.

            A distinction without a difference. Who hired Mayorkas, who can fire Mayorkas? Biden!
But I understand your frustration. However, dementia Biden aside, what we too often allow is for subordinates to take the “fall” for their superiors.

                That’s where I was wrong in an overly long and certainly unrealistic fit I threw yesterday about declassifying. TL Davis on WRSA had the right of it– he encouraged Biden to blanket pardon the upper level agency heads.Why? Don’t we want heads to roll? Yes of course, but better it is to break the system of incentives and protection itself.If these guys walk courtesy of Biden, the public will see the naked implication that they are criminals. If they walk and their subordinates, the guys and gals actually doing the footwork of implementation then get busted by the score and punished by the process, the lure of being a Party footsoldier will go from being rewarded to being dangerous.

            Biden/Mayorkas greatly accelerated the invasion, and put the pedal to the metal, but high levels of both kinds of immigration, illegal and legal, have been going on for a long time.  Immigration restrictionists have called for more border patrol, along with the use of high-tech to help stem the flow for many years and have failed.  This didn’t just begin with Biden/Mayorkas.

                You are absolutely correct.   I worked in the immigration enforcement business for nearly thirty years.   Legal and illegal immigration have been a massive problem for decades.  In fact the country had been destroyed by immigration long before Biden took office.   Mayorkas and his “Hebrew Immigration Aid Society” friends and other NGOs just ended all Border enforcement and also just flew in huge numbers of aliens from around the world.  They made no pretense of any immigration enforcement.   This is a serious felony offense by all involved by the way.Trump will likely just put the system back into the normal chaos mode like it has been for many decades.  He will bring back the illusion that the Border is controlled.   There will likely be no mass deportations.  Trump could do that via emergency order but as soon as one court stops him he will back down.   Trump will also not put anyone in prison for aiding and abetting illegal entry.   All of the top people at DHS to include Mayorkas and many others could be given life terms for this as the penalties are ten years for each instance of illegal entry per alien.Who wants to bet none of that will happen.

                    What can be revised first is the incentive system- the federal tax and wage codes rewarding corporations, small businesses, and municipalities, that is, the bait dangled before the national and local donor class who have no loyalties but to themselves.  As the Zman said, MetLIfe isn’t buying uniforms for the high school baseball team, Bob the auto dealer is.
And, of course, tax code law busting up the NGOs, a Hessco military barrier along the border in one year by the Army Corps of Engineers, and Mayorkas’ skeleton dangling from the gallows by the Senate entrance.

Stellar comment. Granted, expansive government inevitably will lead to elected officials ceding power to bureaucrats, but officeholders have become largely symbolic figureheads, something akin to once fabled but now dazed and confused geriatric senior partner of a large law firm who might as well be a cigar Indian. Examples need to be made of the puppeteers, and the many crimes of monsters like Mayorkas deserve attention, which likely will result in nothing but fear, which has its place.

            What you’re getting at is that there appears to be a group that is strongly committed to open borders, that persists across specific administrations, and that has decisive influence on many politicians.
If there is a group that is powerful enough to force open borders for decades, who is in this group and what are their motivations?
Discussions like this are speculative, of necessity, but we are forced to speculate due to the terrible consequences of the events that we observe.
While it’s certainly true that selfish desire for profit is a factor, greed seems to be an insufficient explanation.

                    I doubt the developer is Venezuelan (but he could be — even Venezuelans have a handful of guys at the far right end of the bell curve). Financial crimes quite frequently are associated with certain groups.

                            I don’t class those as “financial crimes.” They’re just ordinary robberies of high value stuff.
What I meant was stuff like market manipulation, or, in this case, knowing enough about ATM operating systems to be able to create a hard drive you can swap in to alter their behavior.

                            Colombian gangs work over jewellery trade shows in East and South-East Asia. Mostly done by deception and carefully choreographed multi-participant sleights of hand.
There are other Colombian gangs which specialise in theft from high end hotel rooms.
Then there’s the drugs and hookers. Lovely people.

            Sounds like backing the blue is worth it~!
In my zone, we had a spree of stolen cars, they drove around pilfering parked cars. Local sheriffs came by and said, ‘nothing we can do so sorry’ and that was that. We found a discarded set of keys, a neighbor’s and returned them to her.
What a shitshow, back the blue my ass.

        Even normies can see that the people flooding this country are, at best, a helot class for the elites. The mean though is a bunch of illiterate and nonfunctioning primitives who realistically will never be able to contribute anything to this country and are just here for the handouts. Nowadays, NYC is full of Hispanic women hawking churros, vegetable cups, and plates of comida tipica – sorry but the city doesn’t need this to function. It’s not making the place any better. It makes it look third world. The hotels the city converted into shelters look like something out of Judge Dredd these days. We don’t need this.So, yea, you can’t even realistically make the argument that it is good for the economy anymore, because it’s so easy to see with your own eyes that it’s not.

        From “Fate of Empires” by Sir John Glubb p.13In the age of the first outburst and thesubsequent Age of Conquests, the race isnormally ethnically more or lesshomogeneous. This state of affairs facilitatesa feeling of solidarity and comradeship. Butin the Ages of Commerce and Affluence,every type of foreigner floods into the greatcity, the streets of which are reputed to bepaved with gold. As, in most cases, this greatcity is also the capital of the empire, thecosmopolitan crowd at the seat of empireexercises a political influence greatly inexcess of its relative numbers.Second- or third-generation foreignimmigrants may appear outwardly to beentirely assimilated, but they often constitutea weakness in two directions. First, theirbasic human nature often differs from that ofthe original imperial stock. If the earlierimperial race was stubborn and slowmoving,the immigrants might come frommore emotional races, thereby introducingcracks and schisms into the national policies,even if all were equally loyal.Second, while the nation is still affluent, allthe diverse races may appear equally loyal.But in an acute emergency, the immigrantswill often be less willing to sacrifice theirlives and their property than will be theoriginal descendants of the founder race.Third, the immigrants are liable to formcommunities of their own, protectingprimarily their own interests, and only in thesecond degree that of the nation as a whole.Fourth, many of the foreign immigrantswill probably belong to races originallyconquered by and absorbed into the empire.While the empire is enjoying its High Noonof prosperity, all these people are proud andglad to be imperial citizens. But when declinesets in, it is extraordinary how the memoryof ancient wars, perhaps centuries before, issuddenly revived, and local or provincialmovements appear demanding secession orindependence. Some day this phenomenonwill doubtless appear in the now apparentlymonolithic and authoritarian Soviet empire.It is amazing for how long such provincialsentiments can survive.

        Immigration reform played a role in Obama becoming president. You see, Jack Ryan was a popular and successful Senator from Illinois. However, he was kinky and pushed his wife, Jeri Ryan (yes, the star trek lady), who is actually a very nice and decent person, into having sex with strangers. So she divorced him and all was told in court. Given that Jack was a Republican, he had to resign. There was another very popular person who wanted to run for his seat. But he wanted to reform (meaning limit) immigration and the GOP would have none of it. So they prevented him from running even though he would have easily won and, instead, they ended up with a Democrat: Barack Obama. This put him on the road to the presidency. So the GOP was willing to throw winners under the bus to protect open borders policy, and people wonder why we call the GOP the stupid party.BTW, the Manhattan Institute did a fairly detailed research on exactly which immigrants are good for the economy, based on being net tax payers over a lifetime. It turns out that only those with STEM bachelor degrees and those with higher (Masters and PhD’s) degrees in any field end up as net tax payers over a life time. The vast majority of uneducated immigrants end up as net tax consumers over a life time. Most immigration, particularly that across our southern boarder, is definitely NOT good for the economy.

            The federal government spends something like $450 billion each year on immigrants, a not insignificant part of the deficit. Local jurisdictions spend additional sums, including for education. This helicopter money provides the purchasing power from which corporate billionaires get their cut. That said, I don’t care whether it’s good for the economy or not. They don’t belong here, anymore than whitesen massebelong in India, etc.

            Winning that senate seat was incidental to the rise of The Precious, and overrated in its importance. He was already a rising star, and already a potential potus candidate, merely and solely on the basis of giving a GREAT SPEECH (from a teleprompter) at the 2004 convention. Which is, or used to be, the primary qualification for the D nominee, as their voters swoon over such, qualifications and competence not even considered. In the Democrat psyche this goes back to at least JFK, who they spent the next half century looking for the “next” iteration of, sort of like how the Rs kept looking for the next Reagan. And if you could give the stirring speech that gave them the FEELS, maybe you were it. Or should I say went back to JFK, since, based on the last 3 nominees, it doesn’t appear to be the chief consideration anymore, but for the half century culminating with The Precious that was the way it was. He would have continued his rise with or without that senate seat, which did little to burnish his qualifications, his not even having held it for 2 years prior to being elected potus.

            It turns out that only those with STEM bachelor degrees and those with higher (Masters and PhD’s) degrees in any field end up as net tax payers over a life time.
Those studies will need to be updated to include the second wave of south Asian “workers”, many of which are incompetent in spite of their phony STEM degrees.

        Watching all these “Leaders” (even the ones on our side) suddenly turn from worshiping third world immigrants to finally admitting it’s a problem has been fascinating. This wasn’t a top down change. This came from a lot of hard workers in comment sections, twitter posts and blog essays over the last 20 years. Makes you realize most Leaders are actually Followers.
If you get on a consistent message and hammer it home you can change the world.

        “For most of the 20th century, America suffered little from immigration.”1965 was arguably the watershed year. 1990 was also significant as the year when the H1B visa came into being. Note that I’m talking only of legal immigration.“The sequence was to first sacralize the economy, defined in the interest of the ruling class, then declare things like open borders good for the economy. That meant only a bad person who hates the economy could oppose immigration.”The white working class has always been aware that immigration is bad for its economic prospects and social cohesion. But immigration as a tool to break the power and cohesion of the white working class goes back to the later decades of the 19th century.“De-industrialization and immigration share the same root cause, which is the bourgeoise progressive fantasies about the just society that took over the ruling classes in the last century.”The cause is probably the relentless search for profit by finance capital. The progressive ideology and multi-culti is just convenient lipstick on this particular pig.Keep in mind that Trump is a capitalist who consorts with other capitalists. The interests of this group run counter to restraining immigration. Recall what happened in Trump’s first terms, when a group of Silicon Valley billionaires persuaded him that reducing the number of H1Bs was a bad idea.A core pillar of US elite strategy is to not invest in the American people, and then to claim that enough trained people are not available and that hence high quotas for legal immigrants are necessary. Alternatively, to make some jobs — agriculture, meat packing, construction — so low-paid and hazardous — that white people don’t want to do them and hence the need for illegal migrants, who the authorities turn a blind eye to.

            “The cause is probably the relentless search for profit by finance capital.”Be serious. If the couple thousand venture capitalists all lived in the same precinct, they don’t change the vote outcome.This was primarily a grassroots thing, from mostly Christian Progressivism starting in the late 19th century.I would agree that somewhere in the mid-60s might have been watershed, but it was largely because that’s when churches got heavily  involved in “social justice” Whether we are talking Novus Ordo, or the rewrite of the Methodist Book of Discipline, or the complete takeover of old school Lutheranism by the progs, churches became the moral authority behind this mess.

When the Jews used their Prohibition monies to seize control of the largest party- the Democrats- they threw its Klan machine under the bus, and kept going on to Civil Rights and Hart-Cellar.

I did not know that. I learn so much here. I thought it was older than that.
I’ve often talked to people about how the importance of 501(c)3 to churches gives away the game. Churches honor their creator. Not God. The IRS.

            When I started working in the factory thirty years ago, the work force was almost entirely white, and the threat of a union forming was real.
Now, whites are maybe a third of the work force and the thought of the rest of them organizing a union is laughably remote.

        What our Jewish supremacist ruling class still hasn’t gotten through their heads is that prior actions have consequences.This is doubtless a byproduct of some of their ancestors living in white homelands where others were left to clean up the mess created by their latest schemes. Off-shoring manufacturing and importing immigrants to take care of your physical needs cannot simply be reversed for the plain fact that the guy who does your lawn or fixes your roof cannot also build and run your new chip fab. That’s not merely a hypothetical, as the Taiwanese have been forced to import half the labor just to construct their new government-subsidized fabs in Arizona. The white guys who used to do such jobs are dead, retired, or—as Zman alluded to—on disability.

            My guess is that they are willing to accept less competence in exchange for crushing us.
For naively good-natured whites, this outlook is almost impossible to imagine or accept.
For the most part, we just want to be friendly and live and let live. It’s hard to accept that many groups in the world seem to feel the opposite.
Consider that many non-whites may see the world as a zero sum struggle between tribes and that this outlook is unlikely to change.

                So true! It’s the elites who didn’t come from the Pale of Settlement—probably still the majority—who I wonder about. Boy will they be in for a shock if and when the Tel Aviv-eligibles have to make a quick break for it. Our founders dreaded a Haitian-style revolt; moderns only reflect upon the mythos of the 20th century.

        If there’s a moratorium on immigration, it would have to be applied to all racial groups, given today’s “morality.” As Lawrence Auster put it, the liberal ideology of non-discrimination is the ruling principle of society, where we must not discriminate against other people on the basis of their culture, ethnicity, nationality or religion. That’s what Hart-Celler 1965 was about.But principles can change. The dumping of Haitians into small-town USA and your local shopping mall looking more and more like a Third World bazaar is making discrimination look more appealing every day.  A dream come true would be to see a new version of the 1924 Immigration Act, which essentially only allowed White immigrants.

            Discrimination does not include ability.  Nothing says we can’t vet potential immigrants for skill sets needed within this country.  Most all other nations do so.  So for example, we could award points for English proficiency, occupation, and education and rank entrants accordingly.  Of course, this was never implemented because these immigration laws were not made in the interest of the country.

                    It does not matter. As long as legal immigration is on the table then it should be in the best interest of the society. If we want a White society, then fine, put that in your list of “qualifications”. If immigration is stopped, then at least have H1-b VISA’s. Even Japan—who won’t grant citizenship even to the Koreans they grabbed in WWII—grant such work VISA’s to “foreign devils”.The problem here with many comments is one of “all or nothing—and make it yesterday!” You work in stages as the population wakes up. For example, here in AZ, one of the “old West” States we had restrictive gun laws until 1995 when the first CCW law was enacted. From then on when the world did not end as the Leftists proclaimed, we passed more and more legislation regarding the possession and use of firearms. We were the first (second if you buy into Vermont’s version) State to proclaim Constitutional Carry—no permits, no/few restrictions, stand your ground law. This process took 20 years.Baby steps, baby steps.

                            Then you will fail.  It’s that simple.  The laws will not change.  Massive deportations are not possible.  You have at least 15M that need to go. They are distributed throughout the country. You cannot round up such in any timeframe with any law enforcement agency or agencies.  By the time you start grabbing folk, the publicity will work up the public ire and you’ll be shut down, either at election time or by the Courts.The alternative is to reverse the process that allowed such to occur and *more* importantly to be sustained.  If this were another country, like France or Britain where the illegals were noticeable from the native populace, I might concur.  But this is American with 10’s of millions of non-White people who are now citizens and have been so for generations.

                                Make it too hot for the immigrant invaders. Cut off their taxpayer-supported groceries, child-bearing benefits, rent subsidies, etc. They will self-deport. Not all at once instantly, but that’s how the tide will turn.

                    I don’t think that was @Compsci’s point. Wouldn’t have been mine if I were trying to make a very similar point.
The problem is not with the economic argumentper se. It’s that the economic argument, based as it is on Keynesian principles, is flat out wrong. Subject immigration to a rigorous GAAP-style analysis and it is almost always a loss, if only because on average, the immigrant will not be as “good” as a native, bad as they are.

                    Again, you interpret the argument according to your bias.  If you wish to exclude immigration, then exclude immigration.  If you permit limited or free immigration, then at least vet the immigrants as to what they can offer to the benefit of this society and take in the best according to that criteria.  These two options (there may be more) are different in their possibility of enactment and popular support.The problem is one of what is possible.  Obtain the possible, then come back to the table for more!  The Left intuitively knows this and it has been a successful tactic to meet their goals for the last 50 years. DEI did not come about over night.

For some reason, our side seems completely incapable of understanding this. They’ve seen it in practice for the last, oh, century or so, but can’t seem to grasp how it might be applied to this side.
“All or nothing” is going to always be “nothing.” Sorry for the feels, all, but that’s reality.

                        Compsci, that might have been a reasonable argument half a century ago. But the damage already done to this country is now overwhelming. Comforting ourselves with little victories in the hope that there will be more and better to come is too little, too late.
We have to aim for victory, right now. Nothing less will matter.

            Unless one is one of those “GDP uber alles” morons, that is not true. Economics properly understood is the study of the impacts of the various options in the use of scarce resources. The most scarce resource of all is, of course, your time. You get only so much, and once you spend it, you never get it back.
But I agree that if someone says something stupid like Homo economicus or GDP, it might be time…

            Not only that, but it is highly questionable, IMHO, if that is even true.  The statistics about our economic condition are pure fantasy.The real economy has been collapsing the last 30 plus years.  Industry after industry has collapsed in the US.  Industries we invented no longer exist in America to any large extent.  Industries we once lead are now tiny.  Look at steel, for example. America used to be the largest steel producer in the world by a wide margin. Now we’re a bit player.   Most of what replaced our industrial economic power is directly or indirectly tied to money printing. We experience way more inflation than the BLS acknowledges and so the GDP deflator is massively understating inflation, thus making GDP appear bigger than it actually is.What has really happened is a lot of people have gotten rich strip-mining the US economy and increasing debt my a massive amount.

        Europe and the UK especially have it much worse.
Not only are they deadset on infinity blacks, Arabs and Indians, they’re obsessed with “Net Zero”…destroying energy production and manufacturing while simultaneously creating a need for more housing and a non-achievable manufacturing base.
There’s something seriously amiss with NGO’s that work at cross purposes to push this insanity.  I don’t think anyone in the West knows how to stop it.

            You are right on that. Londonistan was hideously brown yesterday. Hundreds of the brats on school outings. 2 or 3 whites to 25 black/brown/yellow. Not sure who is going to pay for the luxurious net zero housing they will be demanding free of charge in a few years.We have been royally fuc#ed by gov and liberal wimmin.

        The flip-flops on immigration during my lifetime show that there are no principles at stake, only political expedients. In the 60’s and 70’s, the old Left (Cesar Chavez, Shirley Chisolm et al) were against immigration because it depresses working-class wages. Bernie Sanders held this position until very recently. The New Left saw a path to electoral supremacy via immigration, so they joined with the cheap-labor Chamber of Commerce RINOs to promote it. At the dawn of the AI/robot age, deficits are exploding as the high costs of “cheap labor” become obvious. So the flip-flop is flipping again.

            It is hard to fathom, but post-war mass migration originally was a project of a certain type of Republican. Alejandro Mayorkas will go down as perhaps the worst immigration criminal, but check into the background of deceased former NFL player Rep. Jack Kemp, one-time Republican vice-presidential candidate and full-time conman. For reasons of graft and stupidity, he laid the foundation of Bush-extolled migration. So many necks, so few ropes when it is all said and done, but with irreversible damage already done this chapter is coming to a close.

        Another problem with immigration, at least from non-white lands (and that’s the only kind that is allowed) is simple aesthetics. When I walk down the street and into a herd of sundry water buffaloes, warthogs and wildebeasts, I don’t feel like I’m in my own country. I don’t feel like I’m home. I feel like an alien among people who look little like me, and insofar as physical appearance is a marker of psychological and cultural difference, do not think like me. But that final point is as may be. Bottom line–I want to live in a country that is overwhelmingly white because I much prefer gazing upon white people to all others.

                Deep down inside, I believe the vast majority of us do. However, six decades of relentless anti-white propaganda has reprogrammed many whites–especially women–to actually prefer non-whites on all grounds, including aesthetics. Mudsharkery isn’t a thing because those girls actually find nuggras physically attractive. It’s a thing because they’ve been taught to despise their own people and to view abasement before The Other as virtuous atonement.

        They’ve been running The Godfather trilogy on Pluto the last month or so. One of the themes conveyed is the Catholic / Italian / Southern European commitment to family, and that’s what libertarian-minded Republicans miss when it comes to this whole immigration issue. They can’t see the big picture of family, marriage, procreation and being on the same religious and cultural page.The melting pot they wax romantic about was a European melting pot, predominantly. Never before was the melting pot as radical as what they envision it to be now. Statistics say that it won’t work. Interfaith and interracial marriages have a very high rate of divorce.And the other issue is, take JD, for example. His wife is Hindu, he is purportedly a Catholic, though I suspect that was for political purposes. What becomes of his kids? I’m going to speculate that most likely they become nothing. Probably agnostics or even outright atheists, with a general notion that there might be “some kind” of God at best. No religious code, no Ten Commandments, imbued with the secular mentality.I don’t think most people understand how destructive this is going to be to our society and the (culturally) Christian foundation it was built upon.

        Low wage imported labor is just slavery lite and far too many people are fine with it. What has changed is all the imports that would rather do violent crime than be good, pliant peons. And the national debt is well past the point where more lampreys attached permanently to the gummint teat is a defensible proposition. Even the chumbaloneys in Chicago are threatening to vote red.

        As a descendant of the 2nd wave that was cutoff in the 1920s and the child of a DAR, I have more aligned with the DAR ancestry. Even now, I would cutoff immigration from European countries in addition to everywhere else. This shit has been going on long enough. If my 2nd wave ancestors wanted to, they would have stayed and fought for their nation instead of abandoning it. They were let in at yhe pleasure of the original conquerors and should be grateful. Some of the 2nd and 3dr generations of that wave still have idiotic chips on their shoulders too. Deport all illegals and cut “legal” down to 100k a year, of that.

            It is another weird angle to the open borders argument. You are supposed to feel shame for your ancestors taking advantage of the rules a century ago, and that shame should compel you to go along with open borders now. It is a fallacious argument at every point, but the people making keep making it thinking it is a winner. You have no reason or duty to feel anything but pride in your ancestors and you have a moral duty to preserve this civilization for your posterity. Immigration, like any public policy, is about now and the future.

            We’d be better off vetting and ranking potential immigrants.  The numbers could be changed depending upon need.  European immigrants are precisely what we don’t need to particularly discriminate against.  They are predominantly White.  They are educated in a 1st world technological society.  Many are already proficient in English.

                Instead of bringing over more competition against our offspring and true countrymen, maybe we can actually start by allowing opportunities for our posterity. The obsession with impoting high and low skill labor is sickening at this point. Enough indian doctors and latin manual labor. How about true American labor all around? Enough of this legal and illegal immigration nonsense from the border crap today to 1965 to 1986 to the explosion in legal immigration in the early 90s.

                    Increasing the percentage of whites is a net gain for human capital. As such, I support it. What’s more, the specified importation of whites would be either cause or effect of white identitarianism, which is the substrate of the Tradissident movement.

                And many Europeans are fucked up nanny state libtards. Hopefully, their new experience with third world “immigrants” has awakened them to the reality and desirability of ethno-nationalism. At the moment, 90% of Germans would be a depressing drag over here. Smart, easy to assimilate…yes. And they would be susceptible to every leftist appeal.

                    I disagree. Anti-immigrant/pro-white political parties have been making gains across Europe for at least the last 15 years. Sure, there are too many white Leftists over there just as there are here, but they’re nothing like 90 percent of whites.

                No, we’re better off demanding zero immigration. Immigration is immoral. I don’t care if some Indian is an engineer. He’s not my people. He’s also taking a job of an American. If the employer says that he can’t find a qualified engineer, he’s lying. He could find one if he raised the salary.
And, if by chance, we aren’t producing enough engineers, the system will adjust. If you offer $120k for a graduating engineer, guess what, more people will go into engineering. If that doesn’t work, make it $150k.

But the simple fact is that a $150k engineer is going to have to be priced into the product, or there won’t be a $150k engineer. If you won’t buy at those prices,finis. No need for workers and a factory if no one can afford to buy.

                    Spoken as a person never graduating students in a STEM field.  The market of graduates often “adjusts” much slower than the fields/technology can move.  In addition, some fields simply arise out of nothing.  When I was young, there was no—or little—Computer Science as a general degreed field.  Demand outstripped supply.  Of course, the USA was on top of the heap so to speak and it was bad for other countries as well.  Yes, we caught up.  I can imagine however, a scenario where inability to find human resource delays application of technology to our detriment.  We are no longer on top of the heap.  We are a competitor among other nations—and the competition is often for human resources.This whole argument misses the big picture.  The overwhelming numbers of immigrants—IA’s, or legal—are not a sought after resource.  They are not educated, smart, skilled, or able to contribute to a 1st world technological society as we understand such contribution.  To argue against such a minor aspect of the problem while ignoring the major one is misplaced, and as I’ve noted counter to progress in the issue.

        I think most of the US population is generally anti-immigration and has been since prior to the immigration act of 1924. We were lied to and gaslit about the immigration act of 1965 and the powers that be have deliberately avoided asking our opinion about it, or catering to our opinion, ever since.The gaslighting has been non-stop since then and normal people have been trained to think that anti-immigrant sentiment isn’t something you dare breach in polite company — all the TV shows said so!But then the internet came along, people started slipping outside the total media monopoly that existed up until the early 21st century, and the lies started falling apart. People realized that they were not, in fact, in the minority.

            “I think most of the US population is generally anti-immigration and has been since prior to the immigration act of 1924.”
Let’s see if that’s reasonably true. Latest estimate is that 43M USA residents are foreign born—both legal and illegal. I say the illegal are underestimated, but whatever. Add to that 12% second generation or 40M of the population. We now have 80M{ folks with close ties to the “motherland”. That’s no small percentage. Now add in disingenuous Whites and we could easily be talking of half the population.
You may be right, but it’s a close one.

                Consider that a substantial percentage of immigrants and children of immigrants are anti-immigrant. Like the New Yorker who moved to Florida and complains about all the New Yorkers moving to Florida. This has been the big open secret of American politics this century, which both Democrats and Republicans (other than Trump) have been too dumb to grasp, thinking that they have to be pro immigration to pander to hispanics, when the truth is hispanics are pretty evenly divided on the issue.

        Good overview of the immigration sittiation.However, mass-immigration means much more to the ruling class and ruling families atop the GAE pyramid than merely cheap labor.  Open borders are a clear signal that the ruling class seeks both to invade, and ultimately to destroy, the nation as is.  America’s misogynistic, it’s rayciss, it’s Oppressive and worse it’s whitemale.  Infuriatingly whitemale.  Trumpianly whitemale!  Some of its men still harbor the illusion that they are free.That must be dealt with.  For there is no greater threat to a totalitarian nation.That Build Back Better jive damn sure wasn’t Tater Joe’s idea, much as he spouted and spluttered for its dominion.  Our current Betters demand a Replacement Nation for what’s now the U.S., and a transition into the globalist condition.  Klaus Schwab may look funny dressed up in Judy Jetson’s outfit, but he presents the Ruling Agenda.

        Immigration in the general sense was good for the economy,I don’t believe this.  The US economy has been collapsing for the last 25 years.  If not for understating inflation, we probably have had net negative growth over the last 25 years.  Even without the deflator being too small, there is all kinds of BS in the GDP.  From home owners rent to counting illegal drug sales (almost entirely made up, they cannot possibly know the numbers to any degree of precision) to counting “free” services like gmail accounts.The numbers the BLS puts out are just BS. We’ve been monkeying around with these numbers for so long that they really have little connection to reality.

            I would venture to guess it’s not even close.Productivity gains (in terms of output per man-hour, not in the stupid terms government and professional economists use) have been stellar my entire life.Cet. par.,we should be able to afford the lifestyle of the past on a handful of hours’ work per week. And we still can. It’s just that we’ve changed our expectations. Watch a few episodes ofThe Honeymoonersto get a picture of the lifestyle of the working class in the ’50s. You could probably have that and more driving a bus one day a week.Nothing is gained by having working-class immigrants bidding down wages and bidding up goods and services. Upper middle class, you can make an argument for. But muh equity…

                It’s not because of increased productivity, it’s because we’re importing everything from low wage countries. RE, OTOH, is astronomical and is a much better reflection of the increases in the cost of living. Same with cars. We have all these American cars sitting on the lot for 18 months with 100k plus price tags.Productivity has collapsed in the US. The only things we can make ourselves is extremely high end. Even these things are not entirely made in America.Being productive is being able to make fortunes selling low cost goods. Unproductive (but modern) economies always make their money at the high end which are not as cost competitive as consumer goods.If our productivity has been going up since the 70s, where is all the stuff? Where are all the consumer goods we’re producing. We don’t produce hardly any consumer goods. The services and high end manufacturing we export is nowhere near making up for the imports. We’re running like 65 BILLION Dollars a month trade deficits. We’ve been doing it basically since the 90s.You could not even afford an apartment, let alone all the stuff in it driving a bus 1 or 2 days a week in any major US city. You are delusional.

                    I’m not trying to assign causality, Way beyond my pay grade.RE, look at the differences, As late as somewhere in the ’70s, AC was not the norm. Now it’s in every apartment, and considered to be just shy of a human right. My mon’s family didn’t get indoor plumbing until she headed off to college in ’54, and when my folks got married in ’56, they lived in a house with an ice chest. There wasn’t even electricity around there yet.Cars, yeah. Don’t know how old you are, but $500 used cars were typical teen fare into at least the ’80s. I went through 2 of them before I bought my first new car in ’85. You can’t touch that now. But $1000 was still an option until Cash for Clunkers.“If our productivity has been going up since the 70s, where is all the stuff?”Exactly! The gorram government stole it faster than we created it. The Fed had a huge role in it, but at core, it was all the deficit spending. It’s like the border problem — if you don’t plug the hole, you lose.

                        I was a kid in the 70s in a working class family, one of 4 and we had air conditioning in our home.  My mother was a stay at home mother.AFAIK, rural electrification was completed in the mid 50s.  But this was only extremely rural areas.  It had nothing to do with income. You just couldn’t get it because the lines weren’t there.Yeah, I drove 500 Dollar beaters in the late 80s when I was a new young driver.Obviously the proliferation of regulations helped destroy industry in the US.  But the productivity gains are a lie.  While this is also outside of my pay grade, AFAIK, it measured by gov/economists by revenue generation by man hour worked.  We have all this BS work in our economy based on money which makes it look better than it is. You don’t need to actually do much work for this. Pulling minerals out of the ground or turning minerals and raw materials into consumer goods involves a lot of work. It involves a bunch of machinery and workers.  It is also measured with a rubber ruler through inflation. Because inflation is always under counted, the productivity numbers look like they went up and generate record profits.

Before you do the, “Well, I never!”s, watchThe Honeymooners. That’s not all that far off from reality, and the occupation of bus driver was not just a random selection.

        Good Essay Z.  The hardest sell is convincing normie that if Joe the dairy farmer, or Bob the Clam Shack owner, or Dave the fast food joint owner can’t find native labor willing to work at the wages they offer, then maybe they don’t have a viable business plan.Who’s gonna milk the cows?  Who’s gonna serve us clams?  Who’s gonna serve us fries?Who cares, when the cost of Joe’s, Bob’s and Dave’s business is low wages, crowding, environmental degradation, social rancor and cultural discord?Of course Joe, Bob and Dave would be furious if you told them they shouldn’t be in business they can’t find citizens to work at the wages they offer.And, hey, if they all go out of business, their remaining workers will be available for someone else to hire.  That’s how it is supposed to work.  Everyone drank milk and ate clams just fine when there were half as many people in America.

            But it’s not just the labor, it’s the dense weight of regulations and compliance that are wiping out the affordable profit margins. Labor is flexible, but the rest is the crushing burden.
Some years ago, our own Teapartydoc said when he opened his clinic as a GP, he and his wife only needed to take a few small business night classes.  At that time, I had chatted with a restaurant owner who had to start cleaning her own floor mats trying to cut costs…then the EPA branch said that they weren’t being cleaned in an environmentally safe manner.

        A shout out is in order to The Minuteman Project, which started to film and document mass illegal migration under W’s Reign of Error. Members of that group were legally harassed and sometimes even physically assaulted by ACLU and SPLC members and the corrupt FBI under Bush put Minutemen under secret surveillance, which is just another reminder that from top to bottom the Bureau always has been a criminal terrorist organization. People began to question the warmonger claim that “we have to fight them over there so we don’t have to fight them over here” as it became apparent the feds didn’t give a single shit about what happened in the homeland. That, more than any other aspect, was unacceptable to the war criminal profiteers so efforts were made to destroy the open borders critics and their organization.Bear in mind the Minutemen merely filmed the border crossings and this alone caused them to be targeted legally and extrajudicially and subjected to vilification by the State propaganda organs. With the advent of social media, the group became largely irrelevant since government complicity in the greatest crime in American history became undeniable.

            I volunteered with a committed immigration restrictionist here in the Northeast who would travel to the border every few years to help out with the Minutemen and other volunteer border enforcement groups.
He went down in 2022 and saw the disaster.  I think it broke his mind.  He has been in a care facility ever since.  We miss you, Bob.

        In the 1920s the deleterious effects of immigration were touching the Clouds, so they took action. This morning the CEO of United Health was shot dead on the street in Manhattan. News reports were quick to suggest that it was a targeted assassination, which seems odd considering there is no suspect in custody. In the current NYC political climate, it would be in character for them to try to deflect blame away from the potential of this being perpetrated by one of their pets.

            Not condoning violence at all, but it is pretty obvious that targeted assassinations are the inevitable result of captured/corrupt governmental, economic, and legal systems. When desperate men with nothing to lose are deprived of any legitimate means of redress, violence is inevitable. Are the ruling elites really so clueless to think they can prey on ordinary people indefinitely and that the consequences of their tyranny will never come back on them in any way?

                        Why? Because most of them do have some security, usually paid for by the company. His not having any (assuming he didn’t) puts him in a small minority of CEOs of companies that size.

This NY Post article seems to support the idea he was, “a great guy,” with lots of people on his side, so why worry about protection?

        Two things have puzzled me for years. Why not punish those who hire illegal aliens? If the couldn’t find jobs, they’d self-deport, right? Also if a Chinese or Bangladeshi came up through Mexico, why must we deport him on an airliner back to his home country? Why not just push him back across the border and let the Mexicans deal with him? And if the Mexicans try to prevent this? Well, we militarily spanked them once in 1846…

            It is already illegal to employ illegals to work in the USA.  Non-citizens can work and be hired with the proper credentials given out by the Feds however.  The problem is we don’t enforce such.  That is something Trump can do vis a vis his Executive powers.  It will be a tell of sorts if he doesn’t begin raids on such employers.

                So long as an employer made a good-faith effort to procure and retain the I-9 form, he’s generally OK. Which is probably as it should be. Some guy certifies that he’s a citizen, and presents a government-issued ID (Driver’s License) that he could not have obtained without presenting qualifying documentation to the bureau who gave him the license. If he managed to fool the government whose job is supposed to be vetting illegals, and who has access to government databases that the rest of us do not, why is the onus on the employer to do better?

            It’s much easier for aliens from other continents to fly into Latin American countries ( easier or no Visa) and then travel I presume legally at least until they reach the US border where they can dispense with legalities. Thus if we just cross them over the North or South border it’s entirely possible they might have legal papers for that country. Even for those who could legally come to the US say under a tourist visa, perhaps there are advantages to being completely undocumented.

            Elsewhere I wrongly said the murder was an armed robbery gone bad. Now more likely looks like a professional contract killing The hit occurred just before 7:00 a.m. so still dark. It was a guy in a hoodie with a small backpack with a handgun with a silencer attacking from behind. He clearly had a planned route of Escape including on foot and with a bicycle. I suspect he will never be caught.

                Heavy urban area like NYC is perhaps ironically the best place to get away with such, because no need for car (defeating license plate cameras), can wear hoodie/mask/glasses/disguise (defeating facial recognition cameras), and melt back into the city the same way. All that surveillance rendered basically useless. Don’t bring cell phone (duh) and they’ve got basically nothing. If you had to travel there to do it, so what, good luck to them sifting through all the people who travel in and out of NYC. Would be so much harder to get away clean in a more spread out less populated place.

                    Agreed. Although the killing seems to have the marks of a professional operation, for the purposes of today’s discussion it would be most appropriate if the suspect is apprehended and he turns out to be an illegal alien, from perhaps one of those Venezuelan gangs. On second thought many of those probably would qualify as professional organizations.

                It also looked fairly damp in the local area. That seems like it would significantly reduce the chance to recover any quality forensic evidence like hair, clothing fibers, power residue, skin flakes, etc.
I’d also bet the perp had a cache of clothes stashed at a discreet Central Park location. Assuming the bike was paid for in cash and had no serial numbers it could simply be ditched.

                Thu. 06:40 AM: Reading Daily Mail, latest on the killiing is that the bullets have inscriptions on them and other details that suggest, as others have here, political or other personal motives. If the killer really wrote stuff on his bullets and left a water bottle and a phone near the scene, I hereby withdraw my claim that the hit was “professional” and (hopefully) will make no further comment on this crime.

Have you noticed we didn’t have nearly as much Asian and third world immigration until traitor Zero was installed? He used the administration state to give them preference, or at least that’s my theory. I walk into the Walmart on my side of town anymore and I think I’m in bangladesh.

            I don’t see it that way.  Rather I see it as the low hanging fruit.  The folks who are “criminal illegals” are usually in a local jail awaiting disposition—which should be a trip by ICE to a transport center for deportation on the next flight out.  Others, you’ve got to find and arrest, which takes time and more effort.
We’ll see if even this action is a ruse.  Look for criminals being turned over to ICE and then ICE holding them for some type of court hearing and the possibility of them being released into the population once again.

        It’s been a long time, but if my memory serves me correctly, Dr. William Pierce proposed that once an all-white nation was achieved, the grunt-labor shortage could be addressed by drafting white kids fresh out of high school to work on farms and other jobs immigrants now do for a certain period of time. He felt it would also build character and a good work ethic. If nothing else, it would certainly toughen them up! As a Vietnam-Era veteran myself, the idea of any sort of forced conscription still leaves a bad taste in my mouth, but maybe Dr. Pierce was on to something.

A glorious vision of our race’s future—all hail the Job Creator! (by grunting)Fairly recently, an Australian bureaucrat anon on 4chan summarized an emergency bigwigs’ meeting he’d attended, the regime deciding how to get white men to re-integrate into society, especially into the military (WW3 needs blood and prefers theirs). Some weirdo suggested giving the young native men some land, as the country has so much of it being put to so little use, to materially invest them in the literal country’s future—like, instead of enslaving them to Globo-Farm-Corp,make them farmers. This was instantly dismissed.The regime decided on a three-prong punishment strategy instead: Turn the women against the men (“white feather” style), preemptive de-banking of draftees (your notice is an account closure), and total dissident imprisonment.Builds character.

        “It is far too soon to tell if Trump is serious about immigration,”Here’s my cynical prediction.  Trump will shut down the border by arm twisting the feeder countries.  This is within his power.  He will round up the IA’s that are arrested by picking them up upon release.  He will make great PR with this.  However, that won’t remove more than a few hundred thousand of the at least 15M+ IA’s that have arrived—all these I deem IA’s as they have lied wrt their refugee claims—there are few, if any, legitimate refugees at our border.What he needs to do is change immigration law and process.  That he will not/can not do—it needs legislation to be enacted.  He needs to adjudicate asylum claims within 48 hours, not 5 years.  That means the addition of a couple of thousand immigration judges and the building of centers for hearings along the border and in major cities. He needs to “spoil the milk” such that no one without proper papers can work in this country, nor receive welfare.  He needs to then enforce that on those who would hire such labor. (A few “show” trials with 5 years in the can for the CEO’s should do the trick.)  He then needs to create incentives for voluntary repatriation of those IA’s who are jobless, or refuse to show up for their asylum status hearings.Of course, the second part is what *fixes* the problem in the long run—and the long run it will be—as one cannot expect removal of 15M IA’s to happen in one term of office.  The first part is what puts the “rubes” back to sleep.  Which do you think will be done?

            I agree with your cynicism, but not with the solution you propose. The only valid asylees under US law (and international treaty) are Mexicans, Canadians and, arguably, Cubans. They are the only ones who can plausibly say they stopped in the first, closest country to escape the war or tyranny they were under.
Just apply the law. You don’t write down Mexican, Canadian or Cuban on the application for asylum, nope. Go away. Any judge who accepts any application with other country goes to Jail, Do not pass Go, Do not collect $200.

                According to the UN definition (I am told, not read it) an asylum seeker cannot claim economic hardship, nor crime.  So I include MX and CA as faux asylum claims.  Cubans are different in that US law defines their rights—a left over from Cold War.  Not sure what all for Cubans, but something to the effect if they touch our “land” they get in.  If caught at sea they go home.  However, I seem to remember that not always being the case, since we don’t want Castro to jail them for escaping.

At the very least, they are going to have a tough time. Granted, narco gangs run at least the northern states, but not Mexico proper. They could move to a different state in Mexico and probably get away.
That’s why I think it would be trivial. You only have to process a relative handful of claims; most are simply rejected out-of-hand by clerks who can read well enough to decide if the prospective asylee is from one of three countries.

        Essence of immigration is about number is far better than qualitypro-immigration people literally talking low quality of life are acceptable when business accesses cheap labor
Economically, that immigration is making no sense because its replace intelligent and productive human resources to low quality human resourcesIt means forever economic downturn due to lack of social capital producers

        I worked construction in South Florida from the mid 80s to early 90s. It was all white. Virtually no blacks. The consensus was the blacks don’t want to work that hard.

            That’s true for most factory work, too, in my experience. Exceptions, yes, but generally, the white boys are picking up a lot of the slack. And it’s really tricky to get rid of them without EEOC breathing down your neck.

        most people here know that the civil rights wing of the doj was created because blacks couldn’t get a fair trial in the deep south and that the doj would have investigative powers in those types of jurisdictions. While the claim of blacks not getting a fair trial may have been exaggerated, this was the impetus for it.Penny could very well get off but I almost feel like the trump doj’s civil rights division could look at manhattan (which is actually called new york county). Is it one of those jurisdictions where you could basically convict Donald Trump of committing a crime that happened in the 1930s (i.e. before he was born)?

            I thought that the Good Samaritan law might have some bearing on the Penny case, that is, if your intention was to help, even if harm was caused, you could not be held liable?

        While it’s unlikely that an illegal did it, when the CEO of a major corporation is murdered in what was probably an armed robbery, it kind of brings the problem of violent crime to the fore.

        America is filling up rapidly in it’s desirable locations like Southern California and Florida and these are the very places the illegals are concentrated in. The quality of life suffers when you have too many people. But the elites always live behind walls in low density communities so they don’t care.
The elites like the cheap landscaping and babysitting. Their need for servants is well satisfied. For then, it’s to hell with the middle class. They’ve got theirs.

                Which is why his blog is unread.  Clueless—and such is reflected in his commentary as seen today.  His comment is vapid, perhaps not even his but a AI of sorts?
Note he is also one of the first to comment everyday and never returns to comment further on the discussion of the group.  In short, he advertises for readership, but never really contributes to the discussion at hand.
