        Immigration isn’t just an issue for those who live in the border states. After all, the Feds had no problem shipping the latest crop of illegals all over our country to evenly distribute them so that no one state could say it was overrun. As a bonus treat, these illegals also brought along a new virus to share: enterovirus d68.  Who knows what else they’ve got?A sovereign nation should be able to define and defend its borders, and decide who is allowed to immigrate and when. The amnesty that the Marxist in chief is planning via executive order will be an unmitigated disaster for this country. And the establishment Republicans fiddle while America is getting ready to burn.

        The Lebanese are the descendants of the Phoenicians, the great merchants and traders from Antiquity that founded Carthage, their language was West Semitic and very close to Hebrew.
Among the Ancient Greek and Romans the Phoenicians also had the reputation of being deceitful, the word ‘perfidy’ comes from ‘punica fides’ which means punic faith.
They also sacrficed their children to Baal.
