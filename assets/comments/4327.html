        Most surgeons are 1%’ers.I wish I was had been born a 1%’er.It is customary in the 1% and smaller crowd to refer to it in the opposite manner. ie. The ones you have labeled 1%, we call 99ers.The difference in thought styles and processes is exaggerated as you start adding 9’s to the appellation. A triple 9 thinks very differently than a 99er and a quad 9 will be even more different than the triple. Triples and up don’t even get along with each other. They challenge. They compete. Their self image is predicated on being the smartest. Doesn’t that sound fun?I believe that one of the worst things that ever happened to me was being told my IQ at too young of an age. All of a sudden, I was way better than anybody else. Ruins a kid, don’tcha know?Fuck it. This is too painful, but thank you for writing the article. The more people who understand that there is a real difference in us oddballs, the better for us.

        I haven’t found that very highly elevated IQ or accomplishment commonly leaves that individual uniformly elevated in all things, Sometimes the gap is so great that it is startling, where it might not be were the individual to be average in the first place. The people who may be more likely to be elevated in a broader number of things are in the 120’s and 130’s. For what it’s worth, the sweet spot for chess is 135. Bobby Fisher was the exception, but he was also crazy.

            There’s IQ, talent and then skill. Personality layers over it. I’m not an IQ determinist like Sailer and many of the HBD guys. I think personality traits have a big impact on individual success. There’s also talent, which is hard to pin down, but we all know people who are naturally good at certain things and/or terrible at others.
That said, when you start reaching the extremes, IQ becomes dominant.

        This is one of the reasons why I enjoy “Survivor” so much.  You get these folks that far away from their comfort zone, and they turn into looney tunes.  It’s hilarious.There’s a guy right now, a working class (“blue collar”) dude from Boston, who is so intellectually and socially out of his league that he’s having fits.  He totally has it out for this Texan who is head and shoulders more likable (and somewhat smarter, but not much) than Mr. Boston.  Tex is not so much out of his element, as he’s a pretty astute outdoorsman.  It is absolutely hilarious to see this inter-play.Then, you have these really smart ‘white collar’ tribe members who are so much smarter than the others, and they know enough to keep their mouths shut.  “Let the knuckleheads do their things and make fools of themselves, we’ll just sit back and do our thing”, and they’re doing quite well.  I am totally enjoying watching the smart people take over and piss off the ding-dongs.

        There’s a low demand for seven footers and to most people it is a little weird being around a freakish giant.
====================
I would disagree to the extent that there is actually a very high demand for very athletic seven footers who know how to rebound and block shots.

        It would be interesting to see whether the “loner” problem applies equally to men and women at the upper reaches of the IQ distribution. I tested at about 160 on the Wechsler when I was in high school. I’ve never had serious difficulty relating to other people, whether men or other women, and I’ve had close friends of both sexes. It may be that girls learn social skills more easily than boys– that is, if the child psychologists are correct. As for boredom, I’ve never found other people boring– maybe that has to do with lifelong church commitment and activity.

            My guess is the left side finds the right side of the curve uninteresting, but the right side will often find the left side very interesting, for a variety of reasons. Curiosity and IQ probably track very close.
As far as the loner issue, that could very well be a male issue. By nature, males will have fewer friends. Male bonding is about elevating status in order to better compete against other males. It may not feel like that in the suburbs, but that’s the biology.

        I don’t think I’ve ever encountered any 145 &lt; people in real life. Statistically  they are so rare. But online seems like it&#x27;s the other way around in that everyone has an IQ above 120. So where are the other 95%? I guess on facebook and twitter. That&#x27;s the invisible bulk of America.

            Instagram, I’m guessing. Maybe snapchat.My guess is you traffic the same sorts of sites I read so that means mostly college educated, high number of post-graduate degrees and professionals. Those are people better at not revealing their limits, but they also are in the high normal IQ range. The typical MR poster is probably 115-120. Steve Sailer’s posters probably skew a bit lower, but there’s a lot of overlap I bet.Go read the comments on NR when Drudge links one of their stories. You will see a few thousand comments, rather than a few hundred. The comments suggest Drudge’s readership is in an IQ range of 80-90.
