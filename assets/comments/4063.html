        Actually the preferred method of Moslems meting out punishment to homosexuals is to either throw them off a high roof, if available, or crucifying them. Stoning them is simply backup if the other methods fail. Adultery is punishable by stoning to death, but only if it’s an adulteress. Only a brain-addled woman or one seeking to die would commit adultery in a Moslem country.

        For those who bear false witness, the punishment should be what the accused would have received if the charge was found to be true.  Might stop some of this chicanery.

        You will have noticed that sports “journalists” are all in the the rape and violence propaganda. A couple months ago a fangraphs writer wrung his hands over mlb not taking rape accusations more seriously because his wife would not watch his Baltimore Orioles any more, having failed to release a player accused of rape. It was a long comment thread because between the beta boy white knights were a number of fellows who were not going to let them sling it. Short version–Dominican ballplayer and another player take two chicks, friends, from the bar to their hotel rooms. At 2;30 am. One chick cries rape later. The prosecutor declines the case. Civil suit. Ten mil. She hits every check on the date rape meter. 100% are college educated white girls of a certain age. Her defense, literally, is that she was too drunk to consent.

            Sports writers are the most extreme fanatics of the cult. Steve Sailer used to say the contradictions made them insane. They believed that all humans were the same, regardless of sex, race and IQ. Yet, they were required to document how some humans were better than others, almost always due to race,s ex and IQ. Their minds were torn apart by the contradictions.Having watched otherwise sane sports writers go mad over the years (Bill Plasche is a great example. Bob Ryan is another), I think there’s some merit to it. On the other hand, I think the true believer is attracted to sports reporting because that’s where the truest of the true of the business exist. Sports reporting is the marine Corp of lunacy or maybe the Jesuits of the Cult of Modern Liberalism. They attract only those who are completely committed to the cause.
