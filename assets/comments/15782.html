        Yeah, that‚Äôs me. I‚Äôm 70 and I felt the full brunt of the revolution by the mid seventies. I knew exactly where it was headed back then and have been screaming at ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù ever since. But rather than being nostalgic for my perfect 50s childhood and my wonderful segregated schools, I‚Äôm very sad that young whites missed what I took for granted. I genuinely feel sorry for what they are going through. They have been brainwashed and misled. And they must find their own way out of the wilderness. God help them.

            The younger ones, including my children, have no idea what they missed.  I was able to get them into a good neighborhood and good schools through hard work and good luck, but they were still washed over with racial and economic guilt trips, and of ownership of all the unfairnesses in the world. They took it to heart and now walk around denying their own selves.  There is only so much I can do, the rest of it is on them.I had the white privilege and sunny disposition of just living my childhood with a bunch of other middle class white kids, and not giving it a second thought.I think my understanding of what was will die with me.  If the people of the future want to suffuse my life with evil and privilege, so be it. I lived it, and loved it, and no one can take that away from me.  Suck an egg if you have a problem with it.

                        He was one of those hyperactive boys who liked to do boy stuff like run around and play sports (and shoot guns with Dad).  He figured out that most teachers wanted him to act like a girl, sit still, and be indoctrinated.  He learned to be suspicious of them instead.  He isn‚Äôt the only one.

            Epaminondas, I hear ya.  I‚Äôm right behind you age-wise.  All you can do is tell the stories.  Today I realize how prescient my old man was when I was a teen-ager‚Äîdo you know, he actually told me about ‚Äúfake news‚Äù over 50 years ago!  That from a man who only finished 8th grade.  Of course, he was casting his pearls before swine as I ‚Äúknew it all‚Äù as a teenager.  The lessons were taught, he just was working with a slow student.  üòâ

        The boomers were mostly shielded from their beliefs. They went to segregated schools, never had to face affirmative action, and never suffered from their mothers being harridan feminists. I am a late gen X and I got the full blunt of affirmative action, but it didn‚Äôt really stop me. I also got the full blunt of desegregation, but it taught reality. White flight had been accomplished by the time millennials went to school, so they went to segregated schools. They got the full blunt of the ‚Äúlefts‚Äù SJW propaganda campaign, however, and they weren‚Äôt prepared for it. My nieces, nephews, and my own children are gen Z and they are some evil little racist psycho bastards. Their cool counterculture is to point at the race hustlers and SJWs and laugh. Millennials were the boomer‚Äôs kids and gen Z are the gen x‚Äôs kids. We will have to wait and see.

            I think Gen-X was always a bit alienated. We came of age in the midst of full blown boomer nostalgia for the 60‚Äôs and Vietnam. I bet most high school grads in the 80‚Äôs knew more about Vietnam than their own country. Therefore, we were always guests, but insignificant. Millennials are an interesting cohort. My experience in the business world with them suggests they are vastly more self-absorbed than their parents. They are transactional and superficial. I‚Äôm not sure how that translates to politics, but my sense is it will the politics of tantrum.

                    I wonder too if there is not a class component. That is, maybe Gen-X was disproportionately lower middle and working class, while boomers millennials skew middle and upper middle class. I have no data to support it, just a hunch.

                        I haven‚Äôt looked up any data, I‚Äôm just going on my own surroundings. All of my gen X friends and acquaintances parents are silent generation and the millennials I know have boomer parents. This generation naming is a moving target.
The silent gen came between the ‚Äúgreatest‚Äù generation and the Boomers.

                            Agree with Macleod‚Äôs generational list.  Speaking from experience, most Gen X‚Äôers had parents from the Silent Generation.  My cohort is solidly Gen X and most of our kids are in junior high and high school, which makes our kids Gen Z.
Keep in mind, most Gen X‚Äôers started family formation in their 30‚Äôs (whereas Boomers started family formation in their 20‚Äôs). So most children of Gen X‚Äôers skew Gen Z.
Also agree with Mcleod that Gen Z kids from suburbia are very conservative.  It seems to be a negative reaction to their Millenial teachers and educators.

                            The ‚Äúsilent gen‚Äù are the ones who came along with Elvis. Too young for Korea, too old for Vietnam. They were in the sweet spot of the 20th century. But totally brainwashed about the ‚Äúgreatest gen‚Äù. They‚Äôre all WW2 fanatics. And they all have books about Churchill prominently displayed.

                It already is the politics of tantrum at least on the Left. That can change especially during civil war or collapse conditionsThe weirdest thing about Gen Y is they are the largest generation yet like us Gen X have tiny families, 1.8 or less  is typical for the entire period. Many have no brothers/sisters few cousins and so on. Its not a surprise you get wide acceptance of ideas like Fam or family is where you find itSo you have spoiled little emperors kids, raised in a society that claims to be free but has large numbers of aspects of a Communist  police state with even higher levels of BS  in a declining economy with massive diversity.Its no wonder they are mess trying to navigate that , all they have is socializing. Its also no wonder they are drawn to progressive causes  and dystopian fiction. It gives them some foundation, things will get worse but ‚Äúgood policy‚Äù can make things betterThey just don‚Äôt understand that all Leftism is corruption and the US is as corrupt as the 3rd world but in different waysWe Gen X had it easier, our society was homogeneous and was a recognizable continuation of the past. Not that we didn‚Äôt get shafted economically and  by all the divorce, latch key parents and so on. That 1.8 TFR did a number on us too.

                    Yes, though we Gen X still grew up in a better country, we have gone through the painful deterioration and loss of it as well. So we know what we‚Äôre missing, whereas the younger don‚Äôt have the experience to miss. Having said that, I appreciate that Gen Z reads and sees videos of better times and are rightfully angry at that which could have been but for our leaders who knew better chose to drive it all into the ground, neglect it all, while they grabbed everything they could to feather their own nests.

                Gen X was the first to experience mass divorce.  That trauma was probably more significant than anything experienced by the Silent, Boomer or Millennial cohorts.

                    Silent and Boomer families were destroyed by white-on-white wars. No more white-on-white wars. Whites have differences but we need to put them aside and band together to defend against the black African tsunami coming our way. And the Latino reconquistadors and Asian pioneers as well.

            One of the boomers‚Äô underappreciated flaws is theirshyness. At least the Midwestern boomers like my parents. They went to the U. of Wisconsin in the late 60‚Äôs and early 70‚Äôs‚Äìthe height of campus radicalism. Bombings on their campus while they were there.
But they were just shy Midwestern kids who weren‚Äôt ready to stand up to the effrontery and shamelessness of radicalism and its (cough) proponents. And they were too shy to speak out against the degeneracy that followed. We just can‚Äôt afford to be shy any more.

                This is a major problem with the Anglo Protestant standard that all white Americans have assimilated to.Maintain a stiff upper lip, don‚Äôt be loud or confrontational, don‚Äôt call people out on their obvious BS to their faces. This standard works well enough around other middle class whites. It falls apart in the face of the loud, confrontational ethnic chauvinism of black people and members of the 2%.‚ÄúNice‚Äù white people have been getting rolled over for 2 generations, waiting for the ethnic and racial activists to start acting like soft, gullible white suburbanites.

                    Yep, the whites hopefully are learning that other races, generally speaking, don‚Äôt do things like white people do. Reading a little on the structure of African families, one can see the blacks do things differently, favoring (among other variances from white ways) polygyny and the fathers not living with any one woman or her children, as well as lack of affection (compared to whites) for black children from mom. One of the many fantasies whites are taught is that black families would be nice, stable, nuclear families the way whites do it if it weren‚Äôt for the terrible racism of Jim Crow days or the corrupting welfare state which incentivizes fatherless black children.  Well, you can take a black person out of Africa, but you can‚Äôt take Africa out of the black person, and they do things African-style. Meaning, African men live with their fathers or other men when not bedding one of many women, while the African moms or better yet the grandmothers raise the kids while the mom works and sleeps around. You can see this way of being continued in modern American blacks, where fathers are no where to be found, moms work (or are on welfare), grandmas raise the kids (i.e., the kids run feral in the streets). Look up famous black Americans and you‚Äôll find many of them grew up this way, the African way. Maya Angelou, Nina Simone, both grew up like that. White people consider it to be an undesirable feral street life, but that‚Äôs just how blacks do it. Would love to see reparations paid to black Americans in exchange for their renouncing their American citizenship. Fantasy, I know. But this is what I mean when I say that, in America, stable, nuclear black families are fruits of Jim Crow. Stable, nuclear families is a white thing.

                        Negro families were more functional when they were expected to adopt the European nuclear structure. It was the ending of Jim Crow and the formation of the welfare state that rewards single motherhood that hastened the end of the colored family. Now they‚Äôve reverted to their natural lifestyle.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Negro Family: The Case For National Action‚Äù is interesting to look into. I have only read the synopses, but he touches on some of the issues at play.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Negro_Family:_The_Case_For_National_Action

I‚Äôm saying that black people don‚Äôt do it that way, never have and never will. The only time they came close to the white nuclear family ideal is when they HAD to, otherwise Jim Crow law enforcement would correct them to act white so as to be productive members of white society. Africans do things African style.

Don‚Äôt get the reference to Mabel. I apologize, I am indeed very emotional today. Seeing the field day against Michael Cohen via our completely corrupt legal process upset me this morning and set the tone for the day. Not saying Cohen is any saint, but just the crookedness of our law enforcement and judicial system has me in tears today. Really, just so despondent about the American situation.

                        p.s. Saw a documentary about a year or two ago about the children soldiers of Africa (can‚Äôt remember exactly which hellhole in Africa, Congo maybe). Was struck when an African mother said that when she heard booms and cracks and scary noises of approaching militants, she was scared by the noises, previously unknown to her, so she ran off, LEAVING HER TODDLER BEHIND. Her toddler ended up being captured and raised to be a child murderer/cut-throat/soldier. I don‚Äôt know a single white mother who would abandon her toddler to oncoming danger. Quite the opposite ‚Äî generally speaking, white women will die for their children rather than abandon them to danger. These differences are real. Carl Jung, after a tour of the U.S., lamented the whites being dragged down and made more degenerate by choosing to living among blacks in the U.S. He was right, we adopt their degenerate ways in some degree and are dragged down from them. Today‚Äôs U.S. has proudly adopted the black ghetto culture, and we‚Äôre all supposed to rejoice about it, this dumbing down and dwelling in the gutter with our lessers.

        In related news, today it emerged that Verizon, a telecom oligopoly, has booked a 4.5 billion dollar loss on buying AOL, Estrogen Post, and the wreckage of post-Marissa Meyer Yahoo. Yet still further evidence that production of propaganda is more important than even the sacrosanct shareholder value.
It‚Äôs one thing for GOP politicians to be corrupt. It‚Äôs a whole different thing when the average middle-class conservative voter to just passively absorb this subversion, instead of putting on their gilet jaune and wrecking Manhattan.

                Much of the left seem clueless about the dissident movements, often thinking that our platform is blood purity over anything else.

        ‚ÄúWhite men of the older generation are seeing the world in which they were born slowly succumbing to the darkness of multiculturalism. Theirs is not a romanticism for that old age, but a growing anger at its loss.‚Äù
I can absolutely and utterly attest to this. An outstanding column.

        I believe that the impact of the two 20th century world wars (which were in many ways one war with a interregnum) is an essential element in understanding self-abnegation and exile in the West. Nationalism was identified as the primary culprit, but the yang of nationalism was religion. Both have been anathematized, with massive help from the, uh, ‚Äúan intellectual class of rootless cosmopolitans‚Äù among us.My father, who served in WWII as a young man, would rail at me (a late Boomer) in the 1980‚Äôs and 1990‚Äôs that ‚ÄúReligion has done more harm that good in the world.‚Äù I would try to explain to him the the world we lived in (i.e., the West) would not exist without the history and of impacts of our religion, and that one could not be separated from the other regardless of the ‚Äúharm‚Äù or ‚Äúgood‚Äù that resulted. He would have none of it. Though he grew up in a reasonably religious  family, he literally came to believe that strong religious faith should disqualify a person from, e.g., serving on the Supreme Court.At the same time that the ‚Äúrootless cosmopolitans‚Äù were destroying our national pride and religious faith, they were surreptitiously initiating mass immigration to the West and promoting it not only as a great good (‚Äúdiversity is our strength‚Äù) but also as inevitable (‚Äúthe browning of America‚Äù). What was never said, however, was that non-Westerners (read: non-whites) who are immigrating to the West have not rejected their nationalities or religions.The result of the self-abnegation of Western culture and the mass immigration of non-Westerners with different and competing cultures, is an all out assault, from within and without, in the very idea of the West: Western culture = chauvinistic, white = racist, Christianity = oppressive, and so on. Anyone my age who simply says, ‚ÄúI liked the country I was born into, and I‚Äôd like to see if we can preserve at least some vestiges of it,‚Äù is ostracized, deplatformed, exiled to the land of the Deplorables, denied the right to make a living and feed their families, and mocked.

                    Not to be overly serious, but our blonde Viking/Scandinavian heritage is the kernel from which white intelligence, physical strength and capability, and beauty come from. Chased all the way back to the northern lands by browns and blacks long ago, they had a good thing going until THEIR OWN NEOLIBERAL GLOBALIST LEFTIST LEADERS DESTROYED THEM WITH BLACK SCUM THEY WILLFULLY IMPORTED FROM AFRICA.

        In a sense, elites are self-exiling into gated communities and prescient whites are self-exiling to rural secure enclaves; both in anticipation of a coming violent revolt. The.elites fear an imagined redneck hoard and the preppers foresee chaotic marauding gangs. The current zombie craze in movies and TV is a reflection of these fears. The more likely Doomsday scenario is the oft-repeated rise of tyranny and authoritarianism from the ashes of the old guard. South Africa will be an interesting leading indicator with a small but well armed minority going up against a large but dependent majority. Europe won‚Äôt be far behind, and there are lots of groups that will fight back with seriousness born of desperation. Perhaps another Gates of Vienna climatic battle. The US will benefit from these examples and be forewarned, and the ocean partitions will buy us time.

                    I‚Äôve recently read that average IQ of 90 is insufficient to achieve a ‚Äòdemocracy‚Äô. The average IQ in Africa I believe is around 74.

        ‚Äúyounger generations, there can be no romanticism or an angry response to the loss of old white America. Instead, there is an acceptance that old white America can never be restored.‚Äù
I regularly meet young, uni educated exiles and their anger is about Trump (for being a bigot). and boomers for not more aggressively implementing cultural Marxism. They don‚Äôt want the old white America to be restored because they feel it was a time of bigotry and white privilege. They want multicultural democratic socialism.

                Most of the good whites of any generation talk of inclusiveness, see diversity as their strength and denounce bigotry in all its forms while living their personal lives (and when they can their professional lives) as though they were members of the KKK. White neighborhoods, white friends, white schools, white white spouses. Maybe that is unfair to the KKK who are probably more open-minded.

                    Indoctrinated, yes‚Äîbut also without an alternative narrative to explain the current world around them‚Äîin which much of what they see contradicts the narrative they were taught.  It often comes up in conversation, you just need to listen.  When the contradiction arises, say in work or social interactions, then the time is right to drop a point or two from the alternative narrative.

                        Cognitive dissonance isn‚Äôt enough to get through to most of them because there is a well rounded system in place to reinforce not noticing. To notice the disconnect of the narratives from easily observable reality, one risks banishment from the good whites with prestige and exile to the bad whites who are viewed as evil losers.Plus there are practical considerations. To be a good white, you keep your social group, your job, your freedom to post nearly anything you want on social media and your freedom to loudly state the approved opinion from the highest mountain top.What do we offer? The right to be attacked on the streets and if you fight back the DOJ and FBI will try to crush you. Getting fired for your beliefs. Getting banned from social media. Always having to watch what you say if you don‚Äôt want to lose your entire social circle.I am comfortable over on the dissident right but I have always been willing to be banished from the herd for being different. Most aren‚Äôt like that.

                    I find that most uni educated whites I meet are NPC no matter the age. Those of us on the dissident right see the newest stupid narrative du jour pushed by the media and see through it easily. Most who have gone to university want to believe the narratives because doing so reinforces their sense of superiority over bad whites.

        The only ideology to stem the tide of leftism came from a bunch of Italian socialists. Even then, it wasn‚Äôt a remotely conservative ideology until it had to absorb elements of the old order. It wasn‚Äôt clinging to the past but forking Progress towards a different future.
There is too much progressive baggage in the West‚Äôs history now that nations can legitimately say they are the products of liberalism. Conservatives have to ask how they can subvert this history. Which isnt really conservative is it?

            I stopped calling myself ‚Äúconservative‚Äù awhile ago. We need to think of ourselves as radicals. Conservatives today are just preserving progressivism. What else is there to conserve? That means forgetting about the crowd that still waves the flag as if it‚Äôs anything other than a relic of a bygone time‚Äîpeople who think they still live in the country that flag represents are idiots‚Äîdolts who are still looking for their based Negro and just want to get back to the Constitution. It‚Äôs going to be a small number since it‚Äôs a rare combination to have traditionalist views but a revolutionary spirit and a willingness to risk internal exile. It maybe impossible in Murica as it stands to assemble that army.One thing cucks are right about is that (White) Americans are individualistic. As Z said, we are the offspring of people who abandoned our old cultures and ways. Add in the huge size of America and political repression‚Äîhow do we get together for real change?

        I believe lack of a link to the past would be a weakness, not a strength. It would also disqualify us as ‚Äòconservatives‚Äô b/c what would be we be ‚Äòconserving‚Äô?? The link to some common loss is what would keep us all shooting (figuratively, feds) in the same direction.

            Materialism is not much of a culture to protect. If our Christianity were more prevalent, maybe whites would not have allowed things to progress to this point. But that‚Äôs exactly why Christianity was attacked and smeared, anti-church/Christianity being a key part of public school indoctrination.

        OT, but the Fields story gets worse.
Heyer was found leaning forward against a front grill, three vehicles up from Fields‚Äô car.  His impact was so slight, she hadn‚Äôt moved, instead of being flung ass over teakettle.
Apparently dead of morbid obesity, heat, and overexcitement.

            Everybody knows that car crash had nothing to do with Heather death.The problem is that religious madness does not need evidence. If Fields was not guilty for Heather death, probably he was guilty for some other crimes. Christianity works the same way. Jesus was definitely no threat to Roman Empire but he was delivering anti Semitic hate speeches according to Bible. So real christian is happy that Jesus got what he deserved with other anti Semites like Hitler and Himmler. Fuck Jesus and support Israel. Religious madness is worst thing what can happen with any group.

                The news surprisingly did‚Ä¶at first.  Once the narrative was crystallizing, everything that deviated from the narrative was purged.  Nothing can ever be deleted forever and a lot of tweets harvested from various journalists covering Charlottesville were archived before they were deleted.  Mike Enoch of TRS fame sent those tweets over to Fields‚Äô (maliciously?) incompetent attorney.It‚Äôs pretty telling that the best they could do for a sympathetic picture of Heyer is use a 15 year old picture of her whenever they talk about her.  Kind of sad that they had to go that far back.  Heyer was a very unhealthy woman and it‚Äôs not a surprise that Field‚Äôs car startled her so much that it killed her.

            You‚Äôre not doing the cause any good by spreading ignorance. The coroner‚Äôs report on Heather Heyer concluded that she died of blunt force injury to her torso. Her thoracic aorta was severed. Her femur was broken. Forensic scientists testified at trial that her DNA matched blood samples on Field‚Äôs car.

        White men predominantly have quite little problem with being exiles from our history.  Many of them are so ignorant of history they‚Äôre not truly aware of it (they‚Äôve been purposely kept ignorant, or given false pictures).  The New Upper Class of Charles Murray‚Äôs ‚ÄòComing Apart‚Äô are well off financially, and still have good prospects for themselves.  They only need to keep their heads down, mouths shut, and play the game, which is an easy trade-off for most of them, as modernity has crafted them into materialist degenerates, to the extent modernity has not conditioned them to embrace the hegemonic neoliberal/cult-Marx synthesis.Even the young, poor, single white males, who have the most testosterone, the greatest predilection for violence, the greatest reasons to be revolutionary, and the least to lose, are thoroughly placated via video games, beer, pot, porn, Hollywood productions, casual sex, and whatever inanities they‚Äôre glued to on their smart-phones.I do not believe there is going to be a mass ‚Äúawakening‚Äù or revolution without addressing those underlying issues that men like Nietzsche, Heidegger, Evola, and Junger were concerned with.  These can only be addressed by men of elite intelligence and independent thought, communicating to intelligent young men, offering them radically new spirituality, morality, aesthetics, etc.  Men like Mark Dyal and Jack Donovan, crossed with the even greater philosophical sophistication of Greg Johnson, are what I principally have in mind here.  On Dr. Mark Dyal (he has a new book from Arktos, and several impressive essays here:https://www.counter-currents.com/author/mdyal/), I strongly urge people to listen to his ‚ÄúNietzsche meets St. Augustine‚Äôs ‚ÄòConfessions&#x27;‚Äù spiritual/moral/intellectual awakening story here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWefbdYw4sIBetween my extremely large extended family, and my work experiences as an educated but underemployed millennial, I‚Äôve interacted with whites ranging from CEO‚Äôs of large bank chains, to rural meth using multiple felons.  The idea that virtually any of these people will begin shooting at anyone, whatsoever, they don‚Äôt absolutely have to in order to immediately save their own life, I find absurd.  The elite have every incentive to prevent matters from escalating that far, and also the means to do so via our massive police state and military.  If the elite must, they can return to ‚Äúboiling the frog‚Äù more slowly, and virtually all whites will acquiesce, right until the West is permanently exterminated.

        In my descent into shitlordism, I knew that we were never going to restore society to any previous period in time.  The 1950s are considered the ideal but it led to the idealism of the 1960s.  If we do win, and I am still optimistic that we will (even if it will take a while), our new period will have to be one based off of cautious optimism where we enact laws or a constitution or whatever that prevents the last 70 years from happening again.  Whatever society we generate will have to have a ‚Äúfreedom from subversion‚Äù clause that gets strictly enforced.

        You cannot trust exiles.  Machiavelli had this dialed 500 years ago.  Listening to exiles, whether Jews, or Poles, or Cubans, or Persians, or Iraqis, had caused us no end of trouble.      Of course the first has caused more problems than all the rest combined.

        Good stuff! I like the challenge you have presented with a broadened and well-articulationed historic perspective on the upcoming chaos.I gotta wonder though, did France have anything approaching the equivalent of a 2nd Amendment ‚Äì I don‚Äôt mean constitutionally, just from the viewpoint of the widespread ownership of firearms (for hunting or protection) among those being exiled?  With no serious counter to the power of the military and law enforcement (particularly when it is entirely controlled by others).  But when the populous has their own force of arms, the math certainly changes.  Once the major cities become ‚Äòfree-fire zones‚Äô and the National Guard is overwhelmed or compromised, those whose only aim is destruction will have some very tough choices to make.  It is beyond hypothetical to project if this would have altered any outcomes in France, but should be factored into any equation for modern revolution/overturning dynamics.  This thought has often crossed my mind with regard to Venezuela.  The example of Iraq, post Saddam, should also give any potential actors extreme caution.

Just read any twitter of a Person of Color or progressive and get another viewpoint aside from lamentation and despair. (Suggestions: Nikole Hannah Jones, Adam Conover, Marie Lu)

                Prosperity = work.Love = a fantasy.For a more realistic take on what ‚Äúlove‚Äù is REALLY out there ‚Äì spend a few weeks reading thru Chateau Heartiste.Anybody who is running around preaching love and prosperity is full of shit.  It sounds good to the young and stupid ‚Äì but reality is quite different.  There‚Äôs quite a few people in the world who seem to run on the operating principle that God will just provide for them ‚Äì no work involved.Pretty sure somebody once said that God helps those who help themselves.  There‚Äôs no animal on earth that I know of that just crawls onto your plate already cooked and ready to eat.  I haven‚Äôt seen a house yet that built itself ‚Äì or a road that magically showed up overnight already paved.The problem with hundreds of millions of people in this country in the current age ‚Äì is that they never had to dig a goddam hole in the ground ,  so they have no appreciation whatsoever for what it took to build the world they actually inhabit.  They think that meat comes from the supermarket,  government checks come from a tree somewhere ‚Äì and that they‚Äôre ‚Äúentitled‚Äù to things.There‚Äôs many days when I actually hope the electricity just goes out and the culling starts in earnest  ‚Äì it gets exhausting listening to the stupid shit that comes out of the mouths and empty heads of a great many of the people I run across.

                    ‚ÄúWealth‚Äù is created when value is added to raw materials. When you say white males ‚Äústole‚Äù the worlds wealth, you are saying that whitey harvested raw materials and used those unused resources to create wealth, or as whitey likes to call it, civilization.

In Ghana, boys would dive in the river to bring up bushels of gold for the white travelers.  The locals had no use for the glittery rocks lining their riverbanks.
That‚Äôs what sparked the 20-year Stampede to Africa.

                            Interesting‚Äîthe concept that YT stole all the POC‚Äôs resources and therefore are today wealthy.  I‚Äôm wondering, is there any country of color in the world where there are *no* resources left, i.e., a place of barren desolation that historians can confirm were once paradises of plenty, until the dreaded white plague arrived to impoverish the country‚Äîsort of like the plot line from the movie ‚ÄúIndependence Day‚Äù.
I think not.  Rather, I see countries that, without YT, have not been able to harvest their abundant resources, nor maintain what was bequeath to them when YT left.

                Stop doing that.By ‚Äúthat‚Äù I mean validating their arguments about how the ‚Äúcoloreds‚Äù built white society thru slavery.  Those claims are complete and total horseshit.In the US ‚Äì black slaves picked cotton.  Any clothes that were made by their efforts have long since been buried in landfills or consigned to museums if they still survive.  What did the slaves on Haiti farm?  Sugar?  Long since then added to coffee and peed out on the ground.Point here is:  much of what slave labor was used for has long since been relegated to dust, poop ‚Äì and pee.  The claims that the slavery from 200 years ago somehow gives the diversity of today a claim on your wealth is the same as claiming that because some black guy gave one of your relatives a free hamburger in 1825 his descendants have a claim on your grocery bill for a year.It‚Äôs horseshit.I don‚Äôt even care if those slaves were used to build hard goods like roads and homes.  Roads need to get rebuilt on a regular basis.  If a slave road gang was used to carve out a road in 1825 ‚Äì that sucker has been repaved 25 times since that day.  That means WHITE MEN likely repaved it every time since then.The claims of current day diversity to the fruits of labor from yesteryear are complete and totally demonstrable horseshit.

                    Carlsdad, you pretty much prove that we‚Äôre under occupation by a foreign value system.
Debt bondage is dominant in the Semitic world.  If Abu‚Äôs grandad owed Hajib‚Äôs grandad a goat, Abu‚Äôs descendants will still be working Hajib‚Äôs brickyard for free, seven generations later.
Just a rough illustration of why we owe the eight (((families))) that own the Federal Reserve 6%  off the top and their Third World overseers everything else.  It‚Äôs a slave system.

                    Actually Cal, there is one product of humans that does not wear out and go away‚Äîthose products are of the mind.  In that case, Western Society is owed a great deal more than third worlders can ever hope to repay.

                        All of the ‚Äúslavery built this‚Äù crowd ‚Äì are not talking about the world of the mind. They‚Äôre talking about the physical world around us ‚Äì which none of them in my experience know a single goddamned thing about.They‚Äôll sit there and tell you that ‚Äúthey built the roads‚Äù when the reality is that the roads were rebuilt likely dozens of times since slaves (allegedly) hacked them out of the woods.They‚Äôll tell you that slaves built the White House ‚Äì again ‚Äì so what? ( I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs true but lets say it is) ‚Äì how many times has the White House been rebuilt since the war of 1812?I built my own house.  I did so by adding onto an existing house.  Do the carpenters from 1954 have a claim on that house because they built some of it? I don‚Äôt think so ‚Äì especially because most of what they did got carted away in a dumpster.This is the reality of much all of the physical world.  Things don‚Äôt just get built ‚Äì and then withstand the tests of time with no maintainence or further input of human labor.  So when I see people start ranting and raving about how slaves ‚Äúbuilt this‚Äù or ‚Äúbuilt that‚Äù ‚Äì I say:  who gives a shit?  Much of what they did is LONG GONE ‚Äì worn away by the winds of time.They have NO claim on the present day.

            You make a very strong argument for separation, Jimmy. I say, by all means, let the Persons of Color live how they want to in their countries, and we will live the ‚Äúlove hindering‚Äù western civilization in our countries.

            Yeah so?  What‚Äôs your point?There‚Äôs hundreds of millions of people in the world that view Communism and Socialism as great things ‚Äì even though they CONSTANTLY implode in on themselves and kill people off by the millions.Meanwhile ‚Äì the world as a whole is getting richer because of something approximating capitalism ‚Äì yet all these people who now have leisure time on their hands think the best use of that time is to go out and protest capitalism.I don‚Äôt take seriously a bunch of black people standing around protesting ‚Äúwhite supremacy‚Äù ‚Äì after they just finished burning down their own neighborhood.Sometimes people are just phucking stoopid.

                Depends on how you view such folks supporting socialism.  Dumb is one way, but to me seems incomplete.  A more complete view in my experience is that these people are losers and not able by their own means to avail themselves of the bounty produced in a capitalist society.  They are ultimately ‚Äúsatisfied‚Äù making folks equally poor than unequally wealthy.  I believe there are any number of studies bearing such out.

            Oh hey Duck. You‚Äôve changed your posting style a little. Thanks for dropping by.No one on Planet Earth has love and prosperity and people of color were killing,  eating and enslaving one another long before Whites came along. White (Latino, the remains in Africa) civilization is about the only thing that mitigates that and it requires either actual Christianity or a lot of Whiteness or both.Asians have a civil order of their, they however only see ‚Äúof color‚Äù to them those aren‚Äôt people . They only groups they see as people are Asians and some more Progressive ones, as lesser people Whites and other Asian groupsTruth is people of every race are tribal, Whites right now less so until they revert which happens with shocking speed.This means basically no one cares what other groups think or want except fools and racial cuckolds .Its healthy and normal and the futureTL;DR nobody cares very much

            And alternative is feudal society which whole world heading toward
Non-white America will look like Smithsonian auction
highest bidder such as Chinese, Hindu, Arab guy will replace ‚ÄúEvil and Racist White men‚Äôs place‚Äù
If you want to join this game at least have to be a billionaire
Every body else, a House and Person in the USA becoming ‚ÄúProperty‚Äù
citizenship and voting rights going to be devalued due to supply and demand
Awesome, Soon most human being feel like they live in Third world which they are
