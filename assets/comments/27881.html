        TheZMan is confusing emergent behaviour with strong emergence in this essay. Strong emergence is still a contentious issue in philosophy, let alone the thesis the TheZMan is putting forward here.

        I think it is the wrong debate.I think it is a religion. This means that the believers can function as a herd. But somebody has to set the tone, to produce the ideas.Let’s review the Elon Musk case. When Elon Musk tried to buy Twitter, he was universally rejected by the managerial herd. Why?Well, no wonder. Twitter is the treasure of the managerial herd. Why?Because Twitter can impose the “right” opinions according to the progressive religion and ban everybody else. It makes sure that heretical opinions don’t thrive.So, until now, there is no mystery: Musk threatened the domain of the True Faith so it was automatically hated. No need of any direction from above, although the hate was repeated in the progressive churches (that is, mass media), so the herd does not forget to hate.Ok, but, how managerial people get these “right” opinions? How do they learn the dogmas of the faith? How do they know that racism is bad and trannies are good?Well, some of these things have been learned in school (racism is bad). Some of them have been learned from media (trannies are good). Nobody is born knowing these things. They have to be learned.Who decides that trannies are good? Some years ago, considering a man with penis as a woman was absurd, even by the most left-wing people.This was an idea that was born in universities. Universities are the monasteries of the progressive religion, where new religious ideas are produced. Then, they jump to activists or to the media. And then to the mainstream.Here you see in detail how the concept of white fragility went from the Universities to the media and, then, to the mainstream.https://hailtoyou.wordpress.com/2020/07/22/on-white-fragility-and-the-academia-to-mainstream-pipeline-an-investigation-into-white-fragility-theory-and-its-life-cycle-from-2011-to-2020/So there are people in the Universities producing the “pious ideas” and the “pious opinions” of tomorrow. Moldbug said something along the lines that the ordinary American man believes what was believed in Harvard 20 years ago.There are other monasteries: think tanks, study centers, etc. These are similar to universities. I will only speak about universities from now on but I refer to all of them.The ideas go from universities to mainstream in two ways. a fast way (see “white fragility” above) when ideas go from universities to media. And a slow way when universities create a new generation of professionals with these ideas. These professionals go to the media, to the schools, to private companies, corporations, etc (this is the origin of “woke capital”). And then, these institutions transmit the ideas to the mainstream.So it all flows from Universities. Gramsci knew that you have to conquer the academy to change the culture. What he did not realize is that, once the academy is taken, the culture does not remain static, since the work of professors is to create new ideas, but always between certain limits.So how these limits are enforced?Let us suppose that you are a professor in a university or think tank and you want to study the dispossession of Whites in America. You may be able to do that because you are tenure, but, will you receive funding for such a study?Who is funding universities? Who is funding specific studies? Foundations like Rockefeller Foundation or Soros’s Open Society Foundation give huge amount of money to develop new ideas in Universities and to extend them through NGOs, media, governments and schools.Without this money, the ideas such as DIE would not have taken off. These unnatural ideas need a lot of money to be popular and remain popular.So, yes, at the end of the chain, there are some oligarchs financing the change of culture. Are these oligarchs coordinated in some informal or formal way? I bet they are but this requires more research on my behalf.The oligarchs don’t establish the details of the new culture (they didn’t invent the term “white fragility”) but they set the tone (Whites are bad, multiculturality is good) by financing only the studies and the civil society that is coherent with this tone.Then the ideas to follow this tone are created and fleshed out by universities and go to the media, schools and government and to the mainstream with the mechanisms explained above.This is how limits are enforced. You can produce new ideas but they have to be coherent with the religion. Otherwise, they are not financed.So there is a chain: Oligarchs -&gt; Foundations -&gt; Universities -&gt; Media, Schools, Government, Corporations -&gt; Mainstream. It is not a formal chain but it exists.This is chain is the equivalent of Pope -&gt; Bishops -&gt; Monasteries and Seminaries -&gt; Priests and Monks -&gt; Churches and Catholic schools -&gt; Catholic people, but it is not formal.This is the religious mechanism that implants ideas in believers.Then, when people are indoctrinated, they function as a herd because they all have the same ideas.I think you are focusing on the second part, which is real. When people have the same ideas, they act in a coherent way without coordination.But there is something more. Somebody has to put the same ideas in millions of minds. There is a mechanism to implant these ideas, such as in any other religion. This mechanism is not herdish: there is an informal hierarchy, as I have explained.

            Good analysis, but in the Catholic system, it is not Pope at the top – it is the Magisterium.  The Pope is constrained by Scripture and Tradition.  On the secular side, I don’t really see a constraint – other than periodic revolution and civilizational collapse.

            Masterful explanation of what is observable when ascending the chain of mass control.Completing the chain with the final links at the top is an exercise in speculation, however allow me to say that I don’t think people – oligarchs – controlling the Foundations are the sparks that set all the woke machinery in motion.Instead I think Soros executes orders as well because he is a new rich. He didn’t oust an older power structure to get where he is currently at, he was simply allowed in. The guys at the top are the Old Money that make up the so called “Markets”.The Markets are not necessarily JQ related, mind you. There may be many Jews due to their nepotism but that’s not the point.It’s about pure power, and power is entrenched.Either you get power dinastically from previous generations, or you wrestle control violently and Soros, Gates and all these oligarchs who are “visible” have never done that, so they must report to someone else.

        @ZMan – re “Emergent behaviour”I daresay I went-into the theories of emergence – bottom-up simulations of ‘teleology’ – at least as thoroughly as you have; and was once a believer e.g. the appendix to:https://www.hedweb.com/bgcharlton/modernization-imperative.htmlBut *eventually* I realized emergence is just metaphysical assumptions of its own validity, analogies and models masquerading as ‘explanation’ – i.e. hand-waving:https://thewinnower.com/papers/3497-a-teleological-metaphysics-for-biology-hierarchical-purposive-conscious-governing-entities-direct-evolutionary-processesAt root, metaphysical emergence is built on the denial of teleology in reality, and the mere-assertion that “therefore” there “must be” an explanation for complex and directional phenomena *without* any direction, purpose or cohesive-tendencies (negentropy) – i.e. there *must be* meaning in an accidental universe without God.But it’s just assertion – and pretty recent at that.

            This is not emergent behavior. Emergent behavior simply means properties of a system that are not present in the individual members of the system. This is a well observed phenomenon in nature and science.

                you can argue about whether some particular phenomena is ’emergent’, but not that emergent behavior exists.  of course it does; you see it anytime a large crowd of people forms.

                @ZMan – I’m afraid you are mistaken.
If you are to pin your entire world view on the belief that ’emergent behaviour’ is an alternative (and non-top-down) form of long-term system formation/ coherence/ growth through changing conditions; you will need to be much clearer about what you mean at a fundamental causal level. Or else you will simply be denying (what ought to be) the obvious.
Nobody else can do this for you.

                    I am getting a strong whiff of intelligent design. Regardless, you cannot get passed linear relations and simple casual relationships, which is why you cannot grasp the concept emergent behavior.

            I will note that you were on the right track originally. You need to think of human society as a garden, rather than a watch. That means thinking in at least four dimensions.

        Just a stray point: In that artificial newsform you linked about the New York gun case from June the actual name of the matter (NY State Rifle &amp; Pistol Assn. v. Bruen) is never given in the text, whether by choice of “Josh Gerstein” or “POLITICO” handlers. It is mostly in the vein of a source-servicing, look-at-these-people-I-quoted c.v. item (Mickey Kaus labeled these “beat-sweeteners”).Time was, the name of the relevant case had to be one of the top 2 or 3 most important things to put in an article about the Supreme Court. I clicked the link within the POLITCO article to another POLITICO article and Ctrl-F’d “Bruen” that I’d turned up on crowd-mayhem site Wikipedia, but like “That woman” I suppose it is now “That Supreme Court case” to the Beltway gangster view of things.Formerly, readers consulted the news for information, now it’s just the society pages for managers.

        I’d disagree with the idea that the managerial class all turned on Elon instantly over the twitter thing.  It was more of a steady process where he kept engaging in minor heresies that raised eyebrows of the beautiful ones until they finally identified him as an enemy.Anyone here who started out as a liberal and turned to the right probably experienced the same thing with their friends.  Initially you get some milquetoast red pills and bring them up in conversation “You know, I think affirmative action should just apply to poor people in general and not be race-based…”  and your liberal friends all start this tally of crimethoughts.  Eventually you’ve said too many things outside of leftist dogma and suddenly all your liberal friends disassociate themselves from you and refer to you as a racist misogynist.  At no point did you jump on the table and start screaming “Wir mussen die Juden ausrotten!”, in fact you were careful to stay within what you thought was reasonable discourse, but you still ended up ostracized.This seems to be a natural process for expelling heretics.  Even in the dissident right there’s a similar process.  You get a few proclamations of “Yay Jews”, or objections towards “Boo Jews”, but above a certain threshold you become a neo-cohen or zio-cuck.

        Elon Musk is best viewed as the Howard Huges of space. He’s largely untouchable because the Department of Defencse understands that the post-Obama NASA can no longer perform it’s primary function of reliably delivering objects into space. Tesla may be the main source of Elon’s wealth, but he’s wealthy because DoD needs him. Hence all the finger wagging from the SEC against Musk, but no meaningful action.My read of the Twitter deal is that the DoD wants to wrestle control of Twitter from the lefties who control it now so it can manage the information landscape as we stumble into WWIII. Musk’s bid was basically a proxy for the DoD. In some ways the Twitter deal is a battle between the DoD and the State Department.

Particular hiver in action. Granted, King is a libtard of the highest order, but damn, the level of “nuance” in that man. Such a shame we can’t resurrect the SS, I’d love to see him excuse Heinrich Himmler.

        1. The NRA has served all the purpose it can, we have the guns.  As they are presently useless in American hands is not the fault of the NRA.  The potential remains for good or ill.2. The NRA is an insurance company which is germane, more significant is if it survives.  It’s survival means defectors.3. Musk has killed Twitter as a business and this is significant, it’s replaced on every side.  Its Iconoclasm not business.4. More significant will be if he DOESN’T get totally but only partially wronged in Delaware Chancery – because that would mean undoubtedly another huge defection from core power of the courts but Delaware is where these creatures park their money.  Delaware not being a sweep blowout Musk 0, Team Prog 💯 100 would be another Dobbs tremor.5. Such a hedging or defection does not mean anything but Elites will to stay on top no matter who they must entertain, observe the Ashkenazim Jews who sponsor and indeed created the UkoNazis.  This wouldn’t be the Cloud people joining the Dirt people, just them finding new Dirt people, but at least then we can go back to grilling, eh?6. Musk has DOD as Rabbi, this is significant already, Musk would not risk space literally for all of the Earth , he’s openly written off earth, we’re a launching pad.  As he should see 🌎by the way.7. As Newsweek recently noted US Military Covert ops are vast and have domestic unofficial infrastructure and cover, to confuse Military covert ops with the Progressive IC 👀 is a Cardinal Category error.  That’s confusing Brennan with Flynn.8. Remember our Cardinal weakness is utter lack of organization.  Read 7 again.9. While their own closemouthed masters both DOD and Musk are NOT Blue Empire.  Nor “us” as there’s no “we.”  But there’s something- even if something else- its something else than the Progs.

            Only thing I can think of that might make Delaware courts at least be somewhat fair is the reputation for being a corporate haven.  If Elon gets too overtly screwed there, it will cause a lot of businesses to think twice before incorporating there, or adding forum selection clauses to avoid it.  Business is big business in Delaware.

        Z gets a lot right in this piece, and the most important of the truths he illuminates is that ideology is more important than structure. We can call the structure that controls AINO–and the West–the Managerial State, the Deep State, the Power Structure, etc., but regardless of what you call it, adherence to a specific ideology either qualifies or disqualifies one from sharing in the power. And this is why I believe the DR braintrust should focus more of its efforts on analyzing ideology and less on describing organizational forms.As an aside, it sounds to me as though Musk is becoming the new Trump. Both are extraordinarily gifted, ambitious and rich men who were once in the good graces of the Power Structure, but are now pariahs. Trump caught the Power Structure with its guard down and became president. The Power Structure learned its lesson and is now, it seems, doing everything it can to make certain Musk doesn’t mimic Trump. I’m not sure if Musk has stated any intentions to run for office, but if he does, we can be sure the Power Structure will spring into action, erecting all sorts of barriers, juridical and otherwise, to make it impossible for Musk to hold any federal and perhaps state office.

                    Agreed. If Musk were a Hutu and an AWR in fine standing, a loophole would be created to allow him to become prez. As is, I suppose they have a natural impediment to prevent Musk from gaining the Anti-White House. They shouldn’t have to do anything extraordinary.

                    The scenario  is zerObama was a nobody so they could create a fake birth certificate without anybody figuring it out.A single white woman having an illegitimate child with a black African in 1963 in Hawaii? … supposedly?  As if anybody would pay attention to anything about that birth?Musk  was born to a relatively wealthy family in South Africa which was a first world country at that time. Impossible to fake the birth data They did not Bend the rules for zero. They lied about where he was born.Musk didn’t even have the contacts to come to America directly. He had to use family connections to get into school in Canada and hop over the United States from there.

They did not bend the rules for ZerObama.  They faked the certificate to pretend that muH constitution was being faithfully followed.

        “All of the other big firms will drop second amendment litigation because they will all be struck by the same crisis of conscience.” – Not a big loss.  It’s amazing what you don’t get with these firms.  Bled dry on a six minute billing cycle.  Only the big clients matter, etc.  The only thing they’re good for is needing the nepotism juice to get past a very expensive regulation at a government agency, where they can call the Administrator personally for resolution.  That’s where the magic happens at these firms.As far as Musk goes, the facts aren’t on his side.  The time for due diligence is before you sign on the dotted line not after.  I’ve read the complaint.  It’s pretty tight.  They even have some of his better tweets on this.  They did a good job.

            Depends.  You can have a due diligence period after the signing, and adjustments based upon activities between signing and closing, etc.  It just depends on what is in the agreement.  Whether the judge in this case goes by that or not is a different matter.

            I disagree. Religion requires worship of a deity or deities. What’s more, unless you’re talking about a very primitive religion, it requires an ur-tex such as the Bible or the Q’uran. What we see from the Left resembles a religion in many respects–the zealotry certainly mimics the behavior of most religious belief in its formative stages–but without the diety and the ur-text, what we’re seeing is just another ideology. Perhaps these desiderata will be added later. If so, we’ll have to think again.

                “I disagree. Religion requires worship of a deity or deities.
Not true. Confucianisn, Taoism and some branches of Buddhism don’t worship deities
Many religions have no texts. Bur the progressive religion has texts, such as the Declaration of Human rights. In America, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.
A religion is an ideology that defines what is good and what is evil. Tha American State is founded on the progressive religion, of which  wokeism is the last mutation

                    Confucianism and Taoism are not religions; they are philosophies of how to conduct one’s life, much like Stoicism.
The texts you mention are hardly specific to progressivism, and, unlike true religious texts (Bible, Q’uran), you won’t find copies on the shelf of every progressive. Where are the churches in which the preacher sermonizes from the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence? Unlike the houses of worship for true religions, they don’t exist.

        It is odd that some members of the managerial state never spoke out about Musk. The regulatory regime that benefited solely Tesla came at the expense of the entire auto industry. The future-dated, regional outlawing of the ICE basically means your entire investment is worthless. Then, between now and that date you have to make this one company profitable by buying carbon credits – some, all or most of your profits are confiscated while you must ditch your entire current infrastructure investment and then invest in an entirely new infrastructure. Where was the managerial class from investors, pension funds, the auto industry during this time? Why didn’t they roar and fight back?Mary Barra of GM did say this EEV project would destroy the auto industry. She is now a leading advocate. Isn’t GM effectively a ward of the state or always a few bond rollovers away? That could explain Barra’s sudden conversion. The Toyota family has and continues to say the same thing. For the rest, crickets. It is odd and astounding.Then there is the matter of Musk and that most of his wealth is in the Tesla stock valuation. Tesla going down would probably destroy the entire wealth effect derived financial system. Not that this Twitter case would harm Tesla, but that company is as much about Musk’s popularity and ability to generate hype. In any case, I think this Twitter thing was well thought through by Musk, who I also suspect isn’t nearly as smart as he and his PR people have promoted him as being. When something is too good to be true, it probably is.I have a hard time believing that some group of someones somewhere isn’t calling the shots. I also don’t see why the deep in the bunker thesis can’t be true simultaneously with the class consciousness thesis put forth by Z-Man. I suspect both are true.I say carry on bettering ourselves, positioning and organizing ourselves and getting out some popcorn while Cult Leader Musk takes on the Cult of The Adjudicators.

            When Trump got elected, one of the major media companies put out a “style sheet” that journalists would consult for how to handle Trump in their stories.  Near overnight, all of the stories about Trump followed the formula.  Indeed, I think you are right and that it is both top down and organic depending on the particular topic.

Everything is odd about Felon Musk. He launches one preposterous, techno-illiterate scam after the other, all of which, for inexplicable reasons are hailed as civilization-changing breakthroughs by the usual suspects.
By traditional market evaluation methods, Tesla is 50-100 times over-valued; I figure the big investors are deliberately involving themselves in naked gambling with Tesla, banking on being the first to know when it’s time to head for the exit.

We don’t know the cost of a Falcon 9 launch, we only know what NASA, DoD, or the private sector pay, the SpaceX cost is far lower than 60-80 million, also keep in mind that Starship will launch 400 Satellites at a time, for far less than a Falcon 9
There are millions of people all over the world who want faster internet, some of them are willing to pay $100 a month, also keep in mind Musk will start putting hardware in his cars too, and I’d bet he wants to sell phones at some point

                    We don’t know the cost of a Falcon 9 launchYes we do, because we have internet and SpaceX sells launches – they sort of have to reveal their price to the customers. $60-80 mils is lowballing it, the sticker price is more like $85 mils.Incidentally, 85% of SpaceX’s “private” launches is really Elon himself using the Starlink Ponzi scheme to pad his books.There are millions of people all over the world who want faster internet,But most of them either already live where you can get a much cheaper and much faster landline, or they’re third-worlders to whom $100 is their entire monthly income.When Musk’s satellites pass over Europe, they will have zero income because zero people in Europe do not have access to fiber. To those few, marooned souls out in the boonies, there are much cheaper satellite uplinks available that rely on only two geostationary satellites rather than 35,000 LEOs.Starship will launch 400 Satellites at a time, for far less than a Falcon 9Says Elon.And his promises always come true. Like the one about those Starships being used to transport passengers from New York to Sydney in 40 minutes – at a price that puts all existing airlines out of business. Or sending people to Mars for $250,000 a pop.All totally legit and believable, and not utterly bonkers to anyone who can operate a pocket calculator.

                        Yes. That’s why Musk has any customers at all. His market is in the gab between no landline access and Viasat being too slow.

                The key to understanding Musk is not what he will make out of a given venture but what all of society will lose out of his ventures and how the losses will accrue as his ventures, particularly Tesla, succeed.According to Musk’s own estimates, having enough batteries to back up the grid would cost $400 Trillion. I repeat, $400 Trillion. That would give a country like the US about one day of backup power. Then in approximately 10 years, you would need another $400 Trillion to replace the dead batteries. Of course, there are the volumes of materials needed as inputs that are truly staggering to contemplate.One of the themes on the Z-Man podcast is how innumerate the climate catastrophists and other pseudo-scientists are. What is puzzling is how and why Musk and his engineers are so innumerate when it comes to making one of the most important assessments any engineer must make – I can build this, but at what cost and for what measured benefit?Michael Kelly at Cambridge and some of his colleagues at the GWPF have done great analysis of the EEV materials and cost problems as well as the benefits of making improvements to the ICE where the physics are known.As Palmer Luckey recently said, “Elon seems to be really good at identifying a business that is about to start receiving a lot of government subsidies and favorable regulation, and starting it.”What the managerial class giveth, it can take away.

Because all his businesses depend on it.

                        Well, apparently he has been asked to count to 11 quite a few times. And every time he has whipped it out, he seems to have decided to use it for its reproductive uses judging by the number of his byblows with whichever biddable woman is nearby.
Wonder if the legalities of this have been thought through, or if the prevailing logic is,“Apres moi, le deluge”.

            Your implicit assumption (?) that the EV will supplant the internal combustion engine is based upon sand. Perhaps quicksand. Absent truly Draconian government banning of the ICE and lavish support for the alternative technology, there is likely no rational economic case where they’d be superior to the ICE*. I’m not impressed by California or some other jurisdiction outlawing the ICE in the distant future. That’s been done purely for virtue signalling the leftist whackos. As the deadline draws nearer and the true economic costs of an all-EV economy loom larger, I surmise there will be a “deferral” of those laws, a de-facto admission they are untenable.*I should allow the possibility of a truly quantum leap forward in (say) battery technology, but that seems unlikely.

                Ben: Your sentiments echo my own.
I can see no way that EVs – and in general ‘renewables’ – can supplant the ICE and the ‘fossil fuels’ based systems that we have.
But I suspect it is more likely that they are not intended to supplant, but just to virtue signal, permit The Clouds to score ‘green points’, and force the every-man to get rid of his conveniences.
Basically: Get us accustomed to a materially poorer life than we’re used to, whilst telling us how great it all is.

        This is just what I see each day here in Covid County.The venue where most local events take place requires that you bring your vax card to show that you’ve been vaxxed and have had at least one booster. The committee that runs the place acknowledges that the vax and boosters don’t prevent getting or transmitting covid but maintain this requirement anyway. I’ve attributed this apparent contradiction to cognitive dissonance and to our passion for virtue signaling.The consolidation of class consciousness, in this case covid consciousness, sounds right. We also like  high gas prices at the pump and feel that the Putin price hike is a boon as well since higher prices, like the vax and masks, attest to our virtue.

            Unlike Christianity, where good and evil coexist in each soul (original sin), the new religion is Manichean, that is, there are good people and evil people.Good people can do no evil. They can be wrong but it is only a human mistake. There are sinless, like angels.Bad people can do no good. They can do something right but they do it because it is only a means to do evil.Bringing your vax card is not about health. It is about proving you belong to the set of good people. You are not one of these evil Trump types. The same with accepting shortages because of Putin.

            The legal issues shouldn’t be very complicated..The acquisition agreement between Musk and the Twitter Board provided that Twitter would turn over certain information about revenue to Musk, but Twitter refused to do so…Hence Twitter is in default, and Musk has the right to terminate it…In discovery, Musk will demand that information again, and the Deep State, which heavily subsidizes the company, will once again force Twitter to refuse..At that point, Twitter should be defaulted by the Court…It will be interesting to see what lame excuses this judge makes up for refusing to do so…

                i also think there is an issue with twitter’s source of revenue; i.e. from intelligence agencies.   if that is disclosed it will most likely be just the first “domino” to fall.  not a lawyer so have no idea how likely a change of venue is, but if delaware is known to be so chummy, that might come into play too.

            Interesting read. I will assume that the lawyers read the merger agreement and the filings. I am shocked that Twitter did not demand language in the merger agreement to address this issue. Twitter management is now at risk of a share holder lawsuit for having bungled the merger and the merger agreement. Even if Musk is forced to pay the billion, he could end up party to a shareholder lawsuit against Twitter management. That would be hilarious.All that said, I would assume there is a settlement to be had. Musk knows Twitter needs the deal. Twitter knows they need the deal. The issue is the price. The market seems to think $40 is the right number. That saves Musk 15 billion off his offer. Not a bad result, assuming the company can be profitable.

        What goes around, comes around. Live by the sword, die by the sword.Amorphous consensus is not confined solely to the managerial class. It can arise anywhere. For example, post-collapse many people will come to realize that the disease cells must go. We can no longer afford to carry the deadweight of corruption and incompetence, and therefore the disease cells must go. Will there be a John Galt sounding the clarion call to rally the antibodies into action? No, that won’t be necessary.First there will be one novel antibody that stands up to dance. Then another, and then another. Arising out of nowhere, with no common denominator, no advanced notice, immune to entrapment (because not stupid enough to join anything), spontaneous, an army of nobodies coming out of the fog with unpredictable irregularity. And not a one of them using anything even remotely like a firearm, so chasing that chimera is a fools errand.Smarter, not harder. Did I mention that the disease cells must go?

        @ZMan – “This is what stumps people about managerialism. There was no official pronouncement from the leader of the managers. The supreme leader of managerialism did not read out a fatwa against Elon Musk. There is not even an anonymous memo circulating that says Musk is now on the proscribed list.“It is a thing that just happened.”It is beginning to sound absurd to read so many posts describing that – at the top-level, where the issues really matter to the top people – we have a managerial system – but then to hear you assert some variation on “it is a thing that just happened”.After all, the point of managerialism is that things happen – not at random (which would be things happening in any direction, and coming and going through time) – but happening because some person/ group *at the top* wants them to happen.And those of us who have worked in managerial systems know how they work (I worked in the National Health Service management part-time for 18 months, reporting to the medical chief executive for 3 million of the UK population, and who later became the national medical CE for the NHS)… And the thing about these big managerial systems is that they are (of course!) *top-down*.Strategy is fed-in at the top, and processed through the layers and across functional specialties, to be implemented at the bottom.How else could vast organizations – such as the world financial/ economic system – hold-together and function, and change in one (leftward) direction everywhere in the world and over several human generations?You here (as often) ridicule the idea of global/ national/ major institutional top-down system surveillance, motivations and regulation as  ‘official pronouncements’/ fatwas/ explicit proscriptions…But there are many (fast, effective) mechanisms by which instructions and prohibitions are transmitted throughout bureaucracies; and many degrees of (informal as well as formal) incentives and sanctions attached to them. When these refer to major global policies – they permeate the entire functioning of the organization, with specific dedicated organizational sub-groups and appointments, and appearing as recurrent agenda items for all significant meetings and documentation.I don’t know why you are so insistent that these same mechanisms (plus, presumably, other and more extreme sanctions and lures) are Not being used up to the highest level of global organization – but the idea of top-down rule and instruction is certainly not as risible as you usually imply.Indeed, these managerial/ bureaucratic forms of organization are the *only known* mechanisms by which societal coherence and purpose can emerge and be maintained through many years, across many places, and despite major upheavals.Any other putative mechanisms for achieving what we so obviously see at work, amount to just hand-waving.

                You can explain it 2 million times and you still won’t be right. You go for days dropping hints that you “get it” and then you fall back on academic wankerism to try and explain good vs. evil. You, and fellow academic wankers, twist yourself into academic pretzels trying to explain reality as chance and controlled by forces of nature that somehow just “happen”. Nothing that happens, at least in human relations (politics, corporations, covenants, etc.) occurs by anything other than a deliberate attempt to achieve a desired outcome.

            I agree to an extent with both of you.
His characterization of things just happening of their own accord is ridiculous.  But it is also not a command and control system with one person calling the shots.  It is a consensus system with multiple poles of influence. That come together on some occasions and oppose each other on other occasions.

                Subtlety is lost on some people. When I wrote “It is a thing that just happened” it was followed by “One day, people with power were showering Musk with your money. Then all of a sudden, they all agreed that Musk was a threat to our democracy.” Context is important. From our perspective, this is what we see. Some people want to imagine an invisible hand at work, but there is no evidence of this.Instead, opinions in the managerial elite form up and take on a life of their own. People who have worked in large organizations have experienced this. There is a social dynamic at work. An idea gets picked up by someone with status and everyone begins to mimic it. There is no secret meeting, no agreed upon scheme by powerful players. It just seems to happen.

                    I can agree with that for the most part. However, that does not preclude some things coming from a high-level cabal. I suppose the ubiquitous one eye symbol is emergent, following your logic. I can agree that many mimic it solely as a form of class consciousness, but I am speaking of its inception and initial proliferation. This compounds with the seeming invisibility of some hugely influential people. It would seem to me that, in the era of everyone’s privacy being violated, the conspicuous invisibility of a few seems a demonstration, paradoxically, of this power. And, no, I am not referring simply to (((them))).

                        Agreed. I have never said we are just corks bobbing along the tides. That is the problem with some people. They think it must all be design or all chance, with no other option. I would bet Anonymous White Male is an ID’er as they are known for that affliction.
The fact is, there are people trying to inject their ideas into the culture stream. Lots of people. Just because they succeed sometimes does not mean that everything is the product of such methods. Most things evolve well beyond what any designer could imagine.

                        I have used it often. I also like the metaphor of the murmuration of starlings and a school of fish. I think people who grew up in the country get these analogies. If you have spent time in nature, you end up learning a lot about human nature as a result.

                    you can see when a new “direction” is attempted, but fails to take hold across the disparate ‘nodes’.  you even occasionally see something clearly at odds with prevailing dogma, get accepted (e.g. when feminists bent themselves into pretzels to excuse clinton’s rapery).
to a large extent it looks like the virus model, where random mutations try and take hold, and most fail.

                    “Instead, opinions in the managerial elite form up and take on a life of their own. People who have worked in large organizations have experienced this.”I can attest.  There is also a lot of institutional memory from prior opinions of people long gone, that support the existing players and their new perceptions and opinions.  I work at a spin-off from a large corporation, and I am the only one left who worked at the former parent company.  I watch with amusement as old decisions, opinions and cultural artifacts continue on from the former parent, despite no one knowing why they were instituted in the first place.  Our current executives add their own twists, but the underlying foundation remains in place.

            Fatwas were issued by the media journos or social media blue checks. However, there was no central command for people to lose their minds and declare Musk to be a filthy heretic. There is no liberal papacy, and indeed they are more similar to Muslims in terms of religious structure. If you look at the Islamic world you may see imams, mullahs, muftis (and Grand Muftis), but the closest analogy to a Pope is in Iran with the Supreme Leader (which is a revolutionary novelty and not entirely accepted among Shia muslims) or now-defunct khalif among the Sunni.Among managerials and their satellites there’s no such equivalent, given the distributed nature of the system. That’s why emergent behavior is a better explanation for that phenomenon. You will have head of the banks (Muftis) giving their opinions to the press, congregating on economic forums, exerting pressure through international institutions, but there is no Big Banker or a central cabal that regulates everything. The system prefers ad hoc bodies and institutions for direct action on pressing issues.This is not a classical oligarchy and that explains why the system produces so much instability. Anyone who worked for corpo or had contact with corporate systems can see how overextended they are and how little decisiveness exist among the higher ranks. Everything is mirred in bureaucratic processes piling atop one another with ad hoc solutions as temporary fixes that get adopted through new guidelines. Like in bureaucracy, you should better know the right person in order to get something done on a small scale. Managerial state thus suffers from the same ailments compounded by greater inertia and multiple actors vying for influence within the system. The hive mind allows it to react quickly, but mostly on visceral level, which means the messaging is getting increasingly dumber.Just because the managerial structure is organized in a top-down doesn’t mean that the entire system works on direct command: scale matters and do does the character of individual subsystems. Commanding them directly is too unwieldily hence the importance of cues and networking that transmits those signals throughout the system. Guidelines can be issued locally, in individual cases like FBI investigations.The dream of direct control died with old socialists who wished to overcome the weakness pointed out by Hayek- insufficient information. You can find somewhere the photos of a futuristic control room photographed in Chile, after Salvador Allende had been ousted. Supposedly the room was to be used as the brain of Chilean socialism.

        I ‘m not so sure that Musk should be counted out yet. There is no doubt that he is one of the Cloud People, based upon his statements extolling socialism for you and I, but not him and his fellow Cloud Dwellers. Basically he is another insider pig who has people fooled. This has happened before. Consider Donald Trump, and now the next darling of the “let vote harder next time! people, DeSantis, as prime evidence of that mind set.Has anyone considered that there may be various factions and subdivisions on top of that Cloud that we will never see? Those people are all out cut-throat for the Dirt People. It seems that there’s a lust for manna and power in their DNA. So,why shouldn’t they be out to screw each other over and either move up the totem pole, or better yet, cast down the old totem pole to make room for their own?What we will see is a family fight amongst the Cloud People who control our country. It may be entertaining, but everything else should be taken for its face value. It’s all just more fiddling while Rome is burning to the ground. And some day those people may well get what they deserve, which is a good old-fashion hanging party on Sunday after Church lets out, bedecked with fried chicken and all the other fixings.

                    They used to have that in Greenup, Kentucky, an old river town. They always had public hangings on Sunday, after the Churches let out, and the people did picnic while being entertained by death.
They had so many hangings that place was called hang town, and the hanging tree was a thousand year old American Elm. The biggest hanging they ever had was for 6 who were all co-conspirators in the murder of an elderly couple. The last one weighed over 500 lbs., and they broke several ropes before they  finally executed him.

                    Probably a grain of truth to that. Haven’t you ever seen the postcard of smiling white folk around the corpse hanging from a tree? This trope even opens Dylan’s “Desolation Row”.
Burnings at the Stake in Europe were often held after Mass, so that the townsfolk could attend. While I doubt they were all scheduled for Sundays, public executions were a “thing” in Europe well into the 20th century. Seems like they fell out of favor by mid-century. Given the cultural rot since then, mayhap it’s time to bring them back.

                        Eastern Kentucky was well known for its proper treatment of murderers. The Porter Lynching that took place in Carter County, Kentucky, was lead and organized by my Great great grandfather himself, old “Pap” Kazee.Pap was one tough evil character, and when he got old he came to live with my maternal grandmother’s parents. My grandmother didn’t care for him at all.One day he had a sore come out on his head, and he let it go for months. When he finally went to a doctor, he was told he had incurable skin cancer and that soon he would die a horrible death. They told him eventually the morphine wouldn’t work, and that he would probably go insane from the pain.Shortly after that he went down to the Falls of Hoods Creek, took his clothes off, and drowned himself in that pool. Today there’s an Old Regular Baptist Church right there, and they use that pool to baptize people even today.

            “What we will see is a family fight amongst the Cloud People who control our country.”We may be seeing this now. There seems to be quite a division among the Clouds over “Russia,” which actually is an ironic euphemism for “China.” Some want to keep the grift going with Chinese trade and bribe-taking, and others want to go full bore to destroy Russia regardless of how badly it impacts US/China relations, especially economic ones. I want to break that into financiers vs. neocons but it probably isn’t anywhere near that simple.The madness surrounding Ukraine, and what certainly seems to be a split on whether to risk a financial break with China, is one of the things that has puzzled me most, and it is hard to see anything remotely resembling the unity of emergent behavior. The Russophobia gets cranked up and then disappears. Again, the “or” part after “China better do X regarding Russia or…” never gets filled in. It is the damnest thing and dangerous as hell.Since I disagree with Z about the Deep State, I will just put it out there: there is a War in the Deep State, and unlike the War in Heaven it is Satan on Satan. The reason is inexplicable even to probably many if not most Clouds.

        System is probably not the best word for what we are seeing. It is more like a mindset, a set of shared beliefs.Like Catholicism in the 16th century a Reformation is taking place among the Levites that supervise American life, the legal profession. For them, the US Constitution is an anachronistic document that no longer reflects the wants and needs of modern society, just as the infallible papacy failed. Since significantly changing the constitution or creating a new one is, at least at this time, simply too difficult and messy, it must be bypassed in the court system. An example of this line of thinking is AG Merrick Garland’sofficial statementin response to the Supreme Court’s decision on the federal role in abortion. Considering that he, and all federal employees, take an oath of fealty to the US Constitution, he should have been made redundant the following day.The use of executive orders to implement federal policies are an obvious tactic to usurp the role of the US Congress. While father of the country Washington and savior of the republic Lincoln used them they did not become common until the two Roosevelts issued thousands of them. It is a sad fact that the Congress has allowed this encroachment on their place in government but they are generally members of the legal profession themselves.

In this our times *do* resemble Ancient Rome—just before the reversion from Senate to Emperor leadership.  The “empire” is too large to be controlled by committee.  It will only take a change in the SCOTUS to allow Presidential “orders” become unchallengeable diktats.

I suggest that culture is a set of behaviors.
“… this class that rules over American society has reached class consciousness.”
This class has a set of malevolent dyscivilizational behaviors that the other classes do not have which make them uniquely unfit to govern or rule.

                It’s going to be a bad winter for them. As an aside, anyone who’s ever lived in Germany knows the following is true (and probably true for nearby nations.) I was there in the early 80s. Even 40+ years ago, Germans taxed the heck out of energy to encourage economy. And they succeeded. Cars were smaller. Private homes typically did NOT heat except the main living areas. And so forth. And recall that the USA was pretty much still the new kid on the block regarding energy conservation (e.g. our first hard lesson beginning in 1973). By the early 80s American cars were only beginning to be fuel-efficient comparable to what the Japanese and Germans had offered for many years.My point: Western Europe doesn’t have any energy “fat” they can cut. They were maximizing economy 40 years ago, and probably well before that.

        The Musk/Twitter thing is pretty curious. Do they want him to buy it or not? They’re suing him to try to force him to buy Twitter, after all!Meanwhile, I don’t think the Delaware judge can re-write Civil Procedure completely. Musk will have some discovery rights. Twitter won’t be happy with discovery in open court, when everyone will see how many Bots run Twitter and all the fake accounts etc. I expect a settlement pre-trial.Of course, I agree with Zman about the increasingly arbitrary nature of the judicial system and the managerial-class hive mind. One way or another, Musk will regret the day he got involved with this thing. The St. George cops could tell him a few things about the legal system.

            Do any of the advertisers have the courage to sue Twitter for fraud based on the number of bots?  That would have to be a slam dunk case.  Reporting the number of bots should crush the stock price, but I doubt the elite would allow that to happen.

                No.  I suspect Twitter is a .gov operation and what we’ve learned in the past 20 years is that economics as you’ve learned it and understand it does not matter.  Neither really does your consumption of various company “products”.  If economics mattered many of the largest firms you know would have been tits up in 2008 and again in 2020.  .gov bails them out not out of the kindness of their hearts (they don’t want an insurrection and when you give money you gain control).  Cheap money aka 0% interest rates for the past 12 years keeps the tech sector and many unprofitable things going.  Which is why i don’t believe the go woke go broke crap, we aren’t in Kansas anymore toto.

        Musk is the good cop of dehumanizing technocracy, whereas Gates, Zuckerberg, and Bezos are the bad cops representing the same force. Musk may be affable and say some things that satisfy people on “our side of the great divide” (love that classic Zman phrase!), yet he nonetheless stands for the AI-driven attempt to render the vast majority of human beings obsolete. He claims that such an abysmal fate is “inevitable.” If that is so, it’s because of fellows like him.

        IMO Musk is the front man for one faction of the deep state and the social media organizations are directed by another faction(s).
This is not some heroic struggle of an individual agains t the machine.   It is one faction fighting another.  Why and to what end is unknowable to us dirts at this point.  They may be a white hat from our pov – or they may not be.
So, its best bot to become emotionally invested in Musks success. Hope that the fight damages both sides. And some opportunity opens up from unintended consequences.

            If there is a Musk faction it’s just him and Thiel and the people they pay, a tiny and goofy remnant of “techno”-libertarianism plus a few of the least awful shitlibs—who still want you dead and your descendants enslaved forever in the “like” mines.
It exists solely at the pleasure of the dominant faction, who really can SHUT IT DOWN (anything in the West) whenever they want. They’re pretty crappy at it, but they can do it.

        Years ago I taught business law at the college level.  I remember thinking that if I ever teach it again (unlikely for personal reasons) I would begin the class with a caveat that it is likely that future legal decisions will be based more on the sociology of the people on the bench than by the traditional means of deciding cases in the common law system.  In other words, don’t learn the law, learn the judges.  But I wouldn’t know how to teach business law that way, nor, I suspect, would very many other instructors.

        The word you struggled and fail to find is:
Cult
The elites are a type of cult that shares a world view, mythos and social coordination.
The late twentieth century cults of mentally ill people following a charismatic leader are only one form that cults can take.  The globohomo elites are an older form, that was mostly displaced by Christianity a millenia and half ago, and then various permutation of new christian sects.

        Maybe this is ultimately how the 2nd amendment “dies” or is done away with.  Gun/ammo/accoutrement companies can’t bank anywhere.  Gun/ammo manufacturers can be sued to oblivion by the fambly of a jogger who gets blasted by another jogger.  Average guys can’t buy guns/ammo/accoutrements via credit card, assuming one can find a company who sells them.  I guess the bottom line is we’d all better stock the hell up while stocking is still to be had.

            Banks have people who work in them who are easily touchable. Court cases that bankrupt firearms business have lawyers that argued the case, and judges who heard it.Managerial class is made up of people, who have home addresses. The key with them is picking individuals out of the faceless army.The managerial class will find out very quickly that implementing their cult group think at the local level will have local level blow back, particularly when people get desperate.To be frank, I am surprised it hasn’t happened yet. I suppose people have not gotten desperate enough after de-platforming ruins their lives. I am aware of exactly one instance of someone going to a physical place run by a tech giant to extract personal vengence.

        the managerial state is a failed state.   their support in the populace (white or otherwise) is dropping precipitously.   just look at military recruiting.   they can’t keep food on the shelves, or fuel in the car/truck.   afghanistan revealed the depths of their ineptness; ukraine the sequel.   only a very small percentage of the populace benefits from their reign; covid is going to be the final nail in their coffins.    no one wants them, no one supports them, no one will miss them.   let’s just see how “powerful” delaware really is…

            All of that may be true, but have you seen anyone step up to the plate to really challenge them? When you’re at a BBQ or in the office, does anyone dare speak out against the acceptable truth?Until there is a tidal wave of cultural force, the managerial state will continue to win. People need to start getting the balls to speak out in defiance of the acceptable truth. Zman has mentioned this a few times in his posts – it’s when people start realizing that they’re not the only ones with these same thoughts start speaking them aloud is when revolution happens.

                I only downvoted you because of your comment “only a small percent of the populace benefits from their reign.” The 130,000 illegals per month coming over the border would disagree. And don’t forget the massive number of unemployed (and mostly unemployable) people on the government dole. Your statement should read, “only a small percentage of the white populace benefits from their rule.”

                    there is validity to your point, but Biden’s fall in the polls with “hispanics” supports the notion that people are not economic animals.

        What better example of how our ruling class and their minions can turn on one of the heroes than Julian Assange. A hatred and lust for revenge so strong it usually is reserved for traitors. To them , that’s what they are.
There is a mighty cause, vaguely construed, that must be advanced at any cost. Trotsky and thousand of others found out the hard way. Of course like you say, a lot of this is just institutional and the mid-level administrators are just doing their job.
