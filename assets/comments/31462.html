        This is what the white griller must understand:
The white griller can‚Äôt negotiate with those whose fundamental goal is to trample and overthrow him.
Just like in the Joe Sobran quote where the white man feels only baffled good will towards the non-white who seethes with implacable resentment at the accomplishments of the white man.
The white griller cannot bargain with or bribe an opponent who is in the throes of a religious fervor to save the world by killing the white griller.

            It‚Äôs quite interesting (and hopeful) that here in the VT-NH-ME whitetroplex. 1/3 leftist, 1/3 griller, 1/3 hard manual labor that immigration was the #1 issue. Whenever I travel into the United States from the tri-state area, I am shocked at how fast the other 47 states are changing.For such a large turnout for Bad Orange Man to occur, behind a ‚Äúfix the 2000 miles away border‚Äù banner ‚Äì well, people are waking up.

                Problem is‚Äîand really always was‚Äîthe 2000 mile away border is right ‚Äúnext door‚Äù just about wherever you reside in the USA.  IA‚Äôs are being relocated as fast as they cross the border by the Fed‚Äôs.  If this were not so, I‚Äôd probably be writing this post in Spanish.  üòâ

        All the gnashing of teeth about those already here. Those here for two or maybe even three generations. There‚Äôs nothing possible to be done about that, right? The Fourteenth Amendment!Did everyone forget that‚Äìby international agreement of the victors, including the USA, China, France, Britain, and the Soviet Union‚Äìone QUARTER of Germany was sliced off at the end of WW2 and given to Poland (a small bit to Russia)? Lands that had been German, inhabited almost entirely by German-speaking people, for hundreds of years? Does anyone know what happened to the German indigenes of those dispossessed lands?They got kicked the hell out. No tribunals, no rights of appeal, no compensation for homes, farms, or factories. Get out, this is Poland now. Many of the expellees were of at mixed background or recently-assimilated themselves (Germanization, intermarriage, etc., had gone on for a couple centuries). Tough. Auf Wiedersehen.

        Gawd‚Ä¶ I love Americans. Always have, really. And the best Americans ya gotta love are the Dissidents and the Texans. I guess those deplorable Texans just told the Supremes to go sod themselves and have been stringing up concertina wire on their border in spite of orders to cease and desist. Even up here in Canada the revolt is spinning up ‚Äì every day in social media Justin Turdo is mocked and ridiculed without mercy, and he deserves every bit of it. He can‚Äôt go anywhere without a wall of security guards to keep the peasants from tearing him to shreds. Signs are cropping up everywhere that We The People have had it up to the gills with their bullchit. The bags of dirty tricks used by the regime is pretty much empty. The dirts know all their stunts, they‚Äôve seen it all before, and the message is clear: this nonsense ends when we stop tolerating it. All the regime can do now is double down; and if you are doubling down on treason and stupidity‚Ä¶ that is not a tactic that wins long term conflicts.The regime has nothing to fear from the normies and grillers with their silly groups like the Proud Boys, Tea Partiers or Oaf Keepers. It‚Äôs the beleaguered lone dissident who has simply had enough. The reality of it is they and their paid actors are one caress of the trigger away from the FO phase of FAFO. The ones that won‚Äôt taunt the police with clues about their identity, the ones that won‚Äôt write gaseous manifestos to the media slobs claiming responsiblity. He will quietly shoot, shovel, and shut up. Sure ‚Äì you can hack elections, surround yourself in the Capitol with soldiers, tanks and guns‚Ä¶ but what about your family? Your friends? Or the hundreds of thousands of defenseless ‚Äúmanagerials‚Äù? If that‚Äôs the only defense you have‚Ä¶whaddya do?The fuses burn ever shorter.

            The ‚ÄúF-ck Trudeau‚Äù chants at UFC 297 were great. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs more just reflective of the UFC fan demographics than anything else, but it‚Äôs still great. Lefties got so butthurt.
Unlike most, I actually see value in ‚Äútriggering the libs‚Äù. It wears them down and demoralizes them.

            Most of the conservative Texans that I have encountered are the very definition of guys who talk tough before a fight and then, at the last minute, run away, boasting about their toughness the whole time.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Mess with Texas!‚Äù they shout as the victory of the Alamo is taken from them before their eyes, again, boasting about their toughness the entire time.
Then, they run away back to their family of half-mexican and half-black kids and grandkids.  Again, loudly boasting the entire time.
Sad, but true.  I wisht that it weren‚Äôt true.

                Although Abbott seems to be doing the right thing for now, his typical m.o. is to do nothing until absolutely forced to.  We shall see.

        There were two wins today:
1. Reid Hoffman announced he will no longer fund Nikki Haley after her poor showing in New Hampshire. Her campaign is in deadpool mode now.
2. The RINO chairman of the Arizona GOP resigned after Kari Lake exposed his attempt to bribe her to exit politics for two years and threatened to release more compromising audio and/or video recordings of him unless he resigned. He tucked his tail between his legs and resigned like a complete pu**y.
It‚Äôs not all that much, but it‚Äôs a start. We have celebrate the few wins we get.

            A 3rd win, sort of: Abbott defying the SCOTUShttps://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/greg-abbott-declares-that-biden-has-broken-the-compact-between-the-united-states-and-texas-invokes-right-to-defend-itself-from-invasion/ar-BB1hcM8MI‚Äôm cynical (I get closest to the truth that way), so I figure Abbott is playing election year politics. Putting Biden in an impossible position. Either Biden backs down and looks weak, or Biden cracks down and looks dictatorial, about an issue on which the majority of voters are against him. Since Abbott has gone this far, Biden now has no choice but to do one of these two things. Assuming Abbott holds the line.Which doesn‚Äôt really tell us much, but it does tell us that Abbott is not on Never Trump Team Biden. (Not that I‚Äôm under illusions about everything becoming all better just because Biden is defeated)

            My spidey sense is tingling. I‚Äôd say take what‚Äôs given but be wary of the hook.
The establishment yielding to Trump after NH reeks. Kari Lake is media, and the idea of GOP trying to make a deal with hostile media on recording also reeks.

        I believe the other side, the BIPOC, the cat lady with the BLM sign, the wimpy leftist feminist guy who anonymously reported you for having a fence one inch over local development regulations and all the other leftist zombies as well as their various backers in high places, are exactly out to finish us and everything we think makes sense. They are so profoundly evil that it seems to have a spiritual aspect which is why I use the term satanic about them.As has been discussed in the last few days here, those who first take uncoordinated action against these pathetic devils, should consider their own temporal lives over. I therefore cannot ask others to do that. You also easily come across sounding like a glowie fed.But I don‚Äôt see how we can ever be at peace with them. Their insane fantasy vision, now extended to the FAA and aircraft manufacture, is a society of chaos that can never work and ensures a future for our children little better than slavery as they rumage through the dumpsters in the favelas of the future. I‚Äôm not calling for armed rebellion against this nightmare. But it may come anyway

        Not to detract from Z-man‚Äôs most insightful essay today, however his basic concepts have been elaborated/noted previously and I believe deserve to be referenced in light of today‚Äôs missive.
‚ÄúThe Vision of the Anointed (1995) is a book by economist and political columnist Thomas Sowell which brands people and organizations that he calls ‚Äúthe anointed‚Äù as ‚Äúpromoters of a worldview concocted out of fantasy impervious to any real-world considerations‚Äù.
Sowell‚Äôs insight of the time is worth a read today as well.  He made quite an impression on me.  (If only Z-man had been around to perfect me then).   üòâ

        Trump should just ‚Äúassume the sale‚Äù and start acting like he‚Äôs already running the country. He should put together a shadow ministry, start sending out ambassadors, broker a peace agreement with the Houthis and send humanitarian aid into Gaza, and start negotiations with Putin and Lavrov about withdrawing NATO forces from Europe. Why not? The other side has already bent every procedural rule in its efforts to force through extralegal change at the margins, so what‚Äôs sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. I would probably work, too.

Another short sighted posting from ID.  The reason why *not* would be that such actions would be potentially criminal in nature.  There are laws against this.  Given that the present regime has already shown a penchant to use ‚Äúlawfare‚Äù, Trump needs no sedition charges levied to muddy the election waters.

Not that it really matters whether there are laws or not. Some DA will figure out a way to frame any act such that 12 spiteful mutants will convict. And even if they don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs cost you your life savings. The process is the punishment.
Unfortunately, this does not stop until there are heads on pikes. The left‚Äôs notion of ‚Äújustice‚Äù is when the left wins.

        Claiming to be ‚Äúindependent‚Äù has been a leftist tactic going back many decades.   Most ‚Äújournalists‚Äù play this game too so they can have plausible deniability when people rightfully point out their extreme partisanship.

            They are ‚Äúindependent‚Äù because to them, the Democrats are not full-blown commie enough for them. ‚ÄúCentrists‚Äù and ‚Äúmoderates‚Äù don‚Äôt exist in real life. Anybody who says they are one is either purposefully ignorant or deliberately deceptive.
More and more people are starting to realize this now, which is probably a good thing.

                Not sure this fits in my case.  I‚Äôm IND because I can‚Äôt stand either party.  Was a LIB for a couple of decades, but they were definitely a dead end.  IND was simply a check box, rather than a ploy.  Of course, when I was voting, the overwhelming choice was REP.  However, I wised up and no longer vote.  My general voting strategy wound up in the end as simply not voting for offices where I did not know the issues or could care less.  For example we vote in AZ to retain judges‚Äîand there are a lot‚Äîand I have no knowledge of who they are or their decisions, who does outside of lawyers?

                    Voting out local SJW judges might be worth your trip to the polls.  Find out which judges refuse to lock up a diverse person for their 30th offense and vote for the opposition.  Also, the local DA makes a difference, especially in the primary if you are a one party county. I‚Äôm stuck with someone worse than Soros in this respect (Larry Krasner) and will not enforce the law against any member of the favored class.

        In any divorce, one or both of the parties first have to mentally break-up before the actual separation can occur. That takes time. That marriage is all that you‚Äôve known. You‚Äôve invested a lot of your life to it. It‚Äôs going to blow your financial world apart. Etc.But once you make that break in your head, it‚Äôs very hard to go back. Bit by bit, you realize that all the pain and money of a break-up will be worth it. You just want out. What‚Äôs more, all those little things that caused you to reach this point become more and more annoying and intolerable.There are millions of normies going through the mental break-up process as we speak. They‚Äôre at the beginning of their journey, but it‚Äôs starting. Even more interesting is that the other side ‚Äì progressive whites ‚Äì seem to be going on the same journey. Indeed, they‚Äôre farther along. I mean, they aren‚Äôt exactly recommending counselling.However, we‚Äôre also starting to see the true elite beginning to backpedal a bit. Jews are beginning to realize that non-whites aren‚Äôt exactly their buddies. Jamie Dimon is noticing that maybe having Trump won‚Äôt be so bad. Personally, I don‚Äôt like this. I want the ruling class to take their anti-white campaign up to 11, not dial it back to 7.Luckily, I don‚Äôt think that they can turn back. Their whole ideology is based on the premise that regular white people are evil. Not sure how you ask liberal whites and non-whites to live with millions of literal Hitlers.

            Great comment per usual. Outliers like Dimond realize they have screwed the pooch but they also have lost control of their unhinged foot soldiers. No, the banksters can‚Äôt put the toothpaste back into the tube but perhaps they can help keep the property division and custody issues less acrimonious. I look at people like Dimond as modern era Kerenskys. Here‚Äôs to hoping this winds down better than the earlier version did.

                Some of the more thoughtful elite and even a few Jews are beginning to notice that their hate whitey campaign likely won‚Äôt end well. They‚Äôre also noticing that they won‚Äôt be able to use Chinese and SE Asian workers as a substitute for whites.
Even Brazil needs some decent workers to keep the rich living well.
The problem for the ruling class is that they have no bench to handle their Golem.

                    I told this story before but I think it‚Äôs worth repeating.. This took place during the George Floyd riot era a few years ago . An angry black man approached me in a crowded store and said ‚ÄúWhat are you looking at white‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt even notice this guy until he came up to me. By calling me white he was obviously filled with hate towards whites, which was being fanned by the media. I stayed calm and just said nothing. He said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, that‚Äôs right‚Äù and walked away. I think if I showed any aggression back to him he would have harmed me.As unpleasant as this was I wish every other Jewish person had a similar experience, with perhaps a worse outcome for the most woke among us. It would open their eyes that promoting an anti-white agenda could backfire on us and can be downright dangerous.

                Think of our elite as a mob ‚Äì a Jewish mob. Like the Italian mob of old, it includes non-Sicilians, some of whom can reach a very high rank. But you will never be a ‚Äúmade man‚Äù unless you‚Äôre Jewish.No matter how rich or seemingly powerful you become, if you‚Äôre not Jewish, you will never be a part of the inner circle and you will never have your own real power base. You can be called before the family at any point if you get out of line.I‚Äôve been making the point that the younger, non-white, non-Jewish members of the elite such as King Cobra are bristling at this arrangement. Whites, like Musk, either don‚Äôt mind or are willing to accept it. I suspect that the Indians, Asians and Muslims in the US want to break the Jewish grip.You can definitely see that the Chinese and even a few others such as the Saudis are fighting hard to get their own power base, which is why you see them pushing back against the dollar and wanting to create their own tech centers and trading relationships.

                Jews‚Äô Achilles Heel is their cockiness. (It‚Äôs also one of their strengths. Such is life.) They figured that they‚Äôd be able to control their mercenaries because they‚Äôre just so damn clever.
Jews are extremely good at keeping grudges but terrible at learning from history.

                    The proper term for Jewish cockiness is ‚Äúchutzpah‚Äù (with a silent ‚Äúc‚Äù). Despite my wariness toward organized small-hat power, I have to admit a fondness for what little I know of Yiddish.

            They can‚Äôt turn back because they‚Äôve succeeded beyond their dreams. Propaganda can be far more effective than even they think. The mass id/subconscious/etc., when directly prodded, learns *very literally*.The lack they‚Äôve created in the soul of the *average* non-‚Äúangry white male‚Äù isn‚Äôt a longing for ‚Äúequity‚Äù but for Total White Death. Anything short of that is a concession to whiteness, cooperation with irredeemable evil.When people who call themselves leftists complain that all Western political parties are ‚Äúright wing,‚Äù this is what they mean (and sometimes they even know it). Capitalism is whiteness, no matter who benefits from it. It‚Äôs an Anglo miasma, no matter who generates it. Merely economically and legally oppressing white people while calling for their eternal destruction but *not doing it right now* is ‚Äúright wing.‚ÄùAs our guys often point out, the lesson of the golem is: if you make a monster, it‚Äôs a monster. The situation the mass-shapers have created requires unprecedented tyranny and death‚Äîto dispose of us, or to restrain ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù and her diversity pals (while also constantly beating us to almost death to satisfy her).

            Like most things that spew forth from the sewer holes that are leftists mouths it is the ‚Äòrule of opposites‚Äô that most strongly applies. Woke = asleep
If they are calling you Fascist, be certain you are talking to one. If they are accusing you of racism, be certain you are speaking to a virulent racist yourself. And when they preach tolerance rest assured, that were it allowed by the state, you‚Äôd be first against the wall for your ‚Äòintolerant‚Äô views and they would cheer it on.

        ‚ÄúIn contrast, the typical suburban peasant imagines a world where he has a job he enjoys, friends to grill with and watch ball games and a chance give his kids a better life than he got from his parents.‚Äù

        I live over 1000 miles from the Southern border.  My city of 50,000 is being overrun with new arrivals. My wife went to the local Ross clothing store on Monday at 11am. You would expect a Monday morning in January would be a dead time for retail but there were almost no parking spots. When she went into the store it was wall to wall squatemalens with middle easterners and Africans as well. As I have reported before, these people are dropping $400 to $500 at a time. The ones that I have seen seem to have pockets full of $100 dollar bills and absolutely no concern about spending it. Like they know that there is plenty more where that came from. They are also acquiring automobiles. Given that 90 % of the ‚Äúrefugees‚Äù are military age men the speculation I have heard that a foreign army is being assembled within the United States cannot be discounted.

                Out here in Atlantic Canada, 5-10 years ago seeing an Indian was a rarity (as in, someone from India, not the indigenous or natives or whatever‚Äôs the p.c. term for them these days). Today, you walk into a typical fast food joint and the majority of the staff, if not the entirety of the staff, will be Indian. Once the turnover starts it goes lightning fast; have read &amp; heard many reports that once the first Indian gets into management, hiring of any non-Indian virtually ceases and the existing non-Indians get chased out by poor scheduling, bad reviews, etc.And let me stress: this is Atlantic Canada. Not Toronto or Ottawa or Montreal or Vancouver, the big centres where most of the people and the money are in Canada. This is like Wyoming or Montana waking up to their local convenience stores suddenly being very non-white.Immigration has rocketed up the issues list in Canadian polling, not that I think it will genuinely matter as the country is too passive and stupid to avoid its Argentinean fate.

That is exactly the problem.
A decent man. But a typical Canuck griller, too.
What is happening now is way way beyond the comprehension of such people.

            About a decade or so ago, I was in Northern Idaho coming home to Tucson from Alaska.  We (wife and I) stopped at an interstate rest area.  While in the public restroom, a large white utility‚Äînot passenger‚Äîvan pulled up and out popped about a dozen, hot, dirty, and sweaty *wets*.  Wets meaning obvious IA‚Äôs being smuggled from the Southern border.  They spoke only Spanish among themselves.They proceeded to use the restroom to wash and change clothes, so I assumed from prior experience on the border that they were about at their destination up North.  Here, IA‚Äôs cross the border‚Äîabout 30 miles behind‚Äîthen just before pickup on one of the two major highways, they change clothes to blend in with the natives in case stopped.  I assumed they had employment offers on one of the farms or ranches of the area.

                    Yes they do.Over three years now a common sight on interstates in the west are white or dark blue busses, windows blacked out. Various licenses.  All I have seen are going north or east.  I haven‚Äôt ever spotted one at a rest stop. Not hard to speculate on who‚Äôs inside.At a much smaller scale this has been going on for decades.One of the small Dakota towns I used to live in. High school yearbook reflected this. Starting in the 1980s. Two of the graduating class of eight were Pedro &amp; Hector.This school closed in 87 though so can only guess what‚Äôs happening now.

            We had a week-long cold snap, snow &amp; ice, here in Middle Tenn, pretty much ending with rain the past two days. I went to nearest Wallyworld with husband on Sunday, bright and sunny but wind chill c. zero/lower single digits. At the check out there was a young, very African-looking woman, wearing one of those colorful printed cotton wrap dresses and matching headdress, playing with her(?) tiny infant in a nice stroller. I didn‚Äôt get a look at the kid, but noticed that the woman was barefoot and wearing minimal leather sandals! Huh?

            It‚Äôs also important to note that all that money gets counted in the GDP numbers, so when CNN or whatever is crowing about the miracle of Bidenomics, they are taking this into account. I suspect this is a primary driver of the migrant industrial complex, once a person gets here, they get a credit card, they get a cell phone, they need a car (states issue driver licenses to anyone these days, and what about motor voter?), etc.I went to the DMV earlier this year and at least 70% of the people I saw on line were in there were obvious foreigners, who lacked the sort of documentation that comes with being an American citizen (SS#, American birth certificate, etc.). I grew up in that area and it was about 99% people of European descent. I didn‚Äôt know how good I had it and what processes were in motion.

                    The shame of your posting is that we had trained many Indians in our dept.  They were known for their hard work and long hours.  However, we also had a staff member‚Äîa real software engineer‚Äîwhose job was to take their work (program code) and change it into something fit to be released to the world.  In some cases, it was easier to tear it up and simply start over again.
Point of the story?  I suspect you are being replaced by a couple of Indians whose work still is not equal to yours.

        The real awakening will happen when cities are burning, grocery store shelves are empty, and rage against societal insanity becomes unbearable and personal. Make no mistake, that pent up rage will explode into violence, and sadly, that violence will mostly be misdirected where it does almost no good in terms of actual remedy. Neighbor will fight neighbor, rioters will fight LEOs, and militias will fight Feds/National Guard. And when the pitchfork mob arrives in DC, they will face off against a lot of white guys loyal to a paycheck/pension. And the end result of this mayhem will be way too many dead alphas on the bottom of the social pyramid.We‚Äôve already seen this endgame play out in Ukraine where Slav has been duped into killing brethren Slav by the hundreds of thousands. And the pathogens responsible for this catastrophe still rule the roost with ruthless destructiveness as their sole goal. What else can explain why the Feds have facilitated an invasion of 30 million illegals during the past 3 years?We can do better. We don‚Äôt have to play the game of mutual slaughter of inconsequential Untermenchen. We can, and should, focus on the root of the problem and make that the object of our remedial efforts. That problem is relatively small and realistically achievable. But it takes creativity and determination. And those are the real traits that made America Great.

            No. This is the logic that says there is no point fighting the Japanese soldier on whatever island in the Pacific because the real enemy is the Emperor, or the war party in Japan or whatever.
The real enemy uses his foot soldiers ‚Äì Antifa, BLM, the cops, whoever ‚Äì to achieve his goals. You can no more ignore this fact than the Marines could ignore the guys bunkered up on Guadalcanal and focus on the ‚Äúreal enemy.‚Äù
There‚Äôs no getting around these implications, even if we want to.

                The warrior ethos has been demonized so thoroughly in the modern west.
There is constant denouncement of remedial and protective violence even when faced with an enemy that is open about genociding the native populations of the west.
Rather than being some virtue, I find the constant aversion to violence to be another sign of a civilization on its deathbed.

                    The alleged pacifism of the Power Structure is nothing more than self-serving misdirection. The PS is more than willing to use state violence against innocent whites, look the other way as nuggras burn, loot, rape and murder, and to incinerate any nation that dares contravene the deranged principles of the Anal Empire.

                    This might be a bit off topic, but it does dovetail. The latest installment of ‚ÄúDune‚Äù was on the other night and I couldn‚Äôt help but groan at the kid they got to play Paul Atreides ‚Äì Timothy Chalemet.For those of you who aren‚Äôt into it/haven‚Äôt read the book, The Paul Atreides character is in his mid teens and is a scion of a well-respected, aristocratic family. One of the things about him is that he has been trained to fight since he was old enough to walk, with guns, knives and empty hands. He has also been schooled in tactics and the strategy of both modern, as well as guerrilla warfare and palace intrigue. He comports himself with a quiet confidence, not arrogance. He is literally a walking, talking weapon.In the movie, Chalemet is a wiry twerp who presents the appearance of one who is very self conscious and constantly appears as though he is going to cry .His exchanges with Jason Momoa ‚Äì the actor who portrays Duncan Idaho ‚Äì lead one to believe that the kid is afraid of his own shadow who would be most at home emoting in a library, not being the future ruler of a great house capable of violence should the situation call for it.This came up in an interview I was reading and the screenwriter, I believe it was, stated emphatically that they wanted to portray his character as ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù with little, to no trace of ‚Äútraditional toxic masculinity‚Äù.This goes to your point of the warrior ethos being demonized. ANY example of that from a European male must be done away with. It‚Äôs no wonder my son loves the shows from the old TV channels. Shows like Magnum PI, or Airwolf and movies like Commando.

                Join a militia if you must and fight tooth and nail against your brothers in the National Guard on our homeland. You will not be alone, many others will join you, both in the fight and in the grave. I count that as a serious lose-lose, as no one who is truly responsible for this mess will ever face accountability. But take heart in knowing that you have created a significant distraction and tied up lots of assets that might otherwise be employed rounding up innocents and sending them to the camps.
I prefer smarter rather than harder.

                pyrrhus:  Perhaps it‚Äôs easier to speak of only ‚Äòillegals‚Äô when dealing with the average individual, but surely here we can dispense with the fallacy that there‚Äôs some innate difference between someone who walked across the border and someone who claimed to be a tourist or student and simply stayed, adjusted status, and was proclaimed ‚Äòlegal.‚ÄôThe immigration process is not something magical.  Way back in my day, we used to be able to refuse someone for ‚Äòmoral turpitude,‚Äô or ‚Äòlikely to become a public charge,‚Äô or simply because our common sense told us this individual was a potential illegal immigrant.  Sailer was useful at least in his coinage of ‚Äòmagic dirt‚Äô and ‚Äòmagic papers.‚Äô  All those non-Whites who proclaim they came ‚Äúlegally‚Äù  are simply claiming they gamed an incredibly broken and bizarre system.Close to 99% of ‚Äúspousal‚Äù or ‚Äúfiance‚Äù visas are issued for fraudulent pairings.  Those immigrants who receive job offers are the beneficiaries of corporate offices who don‚Äôt want to hire and pay White programmers or nurses.  Every ‚ÄúAmerican-trained‚Äù east or south Asian doctor or dentist took a spot from a deserving White.This isn‚Äôt  just my hobbyhorse, and words mean things.  The only difference between ‚Äòlegal‚Äô and ‚Äòillegal‚Äô is two damned letters.  All post 1965 non-White immigrants ‚Äì magic papers or dirt notwithstanding ‚Äì need to be returned to their homelands, along with their putatively ‚ÄúAmerican-born‚Äù children and grandchildren.

I used to mess with them when I was a Roughneck in West Texas and was really surprised when it did that.The ones who need taken out the most will not be in places where they can be found. I‚Äôm not sure we even know Who they are. If I was looking, I‚Äôd want the names of the Bilderberger attendees, WEF, all of the Think Tanks, owners of the federal Reserve, and BIS, the Bank for International Settlements, So many little wizards, hiding behind curtains,I agree, once people start unwinding, I don‚Äôt expect they will be too determined to Know that the target of that anger is really who Has it Coming. I‚Äôm no historian, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to learn that some heads rolled during the French Revolution that didn‚Äôt really deserve it.

                That crew does not seem in the least to be camera shy. Sure, they use Davos and places like it as their Fortress of Solitude, but their faces are public. I‚Äôll grant there likely is quite a number in the shadows, but the ones up front probably are just as troublesome.

                {Sigh} The True Powers impose their will through violence, which is implemented at the very local level.
You can tell, because if it *weren‚Äôt* implemented at the very local level, then Whites wouldn‚Äôt be able to escape it by moving to a suburb two exits down the highway.

                I get the point that you‚Äôd rather get to the puppet master rather than just the puppet.  But if enough puppets see the job comes with undesirable side effects, well, recruiting puppets gets challenging.  Taking a lesson from Hooties (and the Blowfish), find the choke points.

                    I did not downvote. I get your point. I just think @c matt has the better answer. Unless you have mad skills (and even if you do) trading one for one is not worth it. But the smaller fish are much less well protected, and the point of the spear, almost not at all.
Going after the head of the snake, while soothing to Western ideas, is terribly inefficient in terms of who we can afford to lose. Unless going after the head of the snake means raining down PGMs. Or adopting the drone tactics of the Ukraine conflict.

            My hope is that somehow we can figure out how to get past all the intermediate hostilities that Selco talked about, and get to the end stage right away.As is being learned in Ukraine and Gaza, unless you deal with the tip of the spear, no soup for you. Fortunately all those white guys who sold out for a paycheck and a pension have soft squishy families and friends, which Selco points out, once you start using them is when the unpleasantness all starts to wind back down.And, no, that doesn‚Äôt make you as bad as them. They sold out for 30 pieces of silver. You are fighting for the lives of those you love.

            Bad idea. Radicalize the white suburban peasants and you get a bunch of new Proud Boys. Radicalize the Hispanic ones and you get a bunch of new Pedro Gonzalezes. Fun to watch, maybe, but then we‚Äôll get a President MTG elected, and we‚Äôre just kicking the can down the road and extending the lifespan of Liberalism.
Radicalize key people instead. Attract a large minority of peasants to parallel institutions. Then when we take power, most of the rest will go along.

                    The peasants will follow the POWER. Women in particular will follow whatever holds sway over society. That‚Äôs why we have the archetypal white lady with the BLM sign in her yard: she is simply exhibiting her obedience to the herd morality that has formed by elite consensus. Change the dominant morality and that white lady will change too lest she be ostracized by the herd. And most of the peasant men will likewise conform. People in general are sheep. Give them a new ethos that has hegemonic force behind it and the vast majority of the commoners will fall into line.

                        Brexit, if anything, has accelerated the trends, just because the elites in the country have decided to use the post-Brexit era to punish the people who supported it, which is exactly what the elites in the US did after 2016. From British I‚Äôve talked to, the most visible sign is that immigrants are arriving in the UK not from Europe (Poland, etc.) but from Africa and Asia.

Which is the more substantive achievement-Brexit or Sunak as PM?
Which is about presentation and which is about structural change in the UK?
Sunak and Khan do not negate Brexit.

                    True.  30 million ‚Äúmostly military aged males‚Äù  in three years means another 70 million in about 6 1/3 years.  That assumes that the invasion stays linear as at present, which it is not.  It is getting worse.
This does not include all of the other ‚Äúimmigrants‚Äù  not in the military age male demographic but who will undoubtedly support them.   To say nothing of all the sign ladies.
A 100 million man army with logistical support is nothing to sneeze at.

This is the genius of bringing them in unarmed, instantiating them locally, and then later equipping them with military grade rifles, grenades and crew served weapons. They will already possess logistical support here. The three million of us ‚Äúmilitia‚Äù cannot prevail over them IF we fail to assemble soon.

That‚Äôs one way to look at it, but another way is to look at this current number (30M) as a minority breeding cohort as compared to the same aged breeding White cohort.
We now see that, as with Germany, that the demographics are fixed *in stone* that Whites will be reduced to an inconsequential proportion of the population within two to three generations.

        Here is the a question ‚Äì If we shut off immigration today would that change anything?
No one present on this forum here would answer yes.  That might have been an acceptable answer circa 1970 or 1980 or maybe even 1990.  Not now.  The general public doesn‚Äôt want to answer that question honestly.  The easiest answer is always to do nothing, and to fantasize of fluttering American flags and apple pies.  To actually do something means the end of the American way inc.  Either way‚Ä¶

                    Exactly.  As I posted before, I read an analysis that showed that the cohort of ‚Äúmigrants‚Äù that invaded Germany under Merkel (1.5M) was *equal* in numbers to the native breeding cohort of the time!  In other words, there was no way that the native German stock could retain majority numbers in the generations to follow.  The native German stock had sentenced themselves to minority status and their culture to extinction throw dissolution of blood.

                    I‚Äôve said it before but if Americans doubled their birthrates, then the elite would quadruple the immigration numbers. It‚Äôs incredibly easy to do and they‚Äôve been doing it in other countries like Canada which have immigration rates that vastly exceed our own. For better or worse we cannot breed our way out of this. The whinging about birth rates is a pretext, nothing more, especially when it is accompanied by contradictory rhetoric about how first world lifestyles are killing the planet, how automation is going to remove the need for large chunks of the labor force, etc.

                As an engineer for 40 years, numbers matter. Population always expands geometrically not linearly. Too many high birth rate minorities already here to ever hope that we can maintain a majority white population, even if white men and women actually started making babies at the boomer rate of 3.2 kids per couple. Build a 1000 foot wall and shoot all who cross, and we are still looking at majority minority (what an oxymoron) by 2060.

                Unfortunately, not even that will stop this. Not until you end the military-industrial complex, the education-government complex, ALL forms of living at the expense of others, not just the low fruit like welfare and Medicaid and SS and Medicare, but all government pensions, including military and police, all government paychecks, all the way from President to dog catcher.
Unless you are willing to unwind to that point, you will maintain a bifurcated society that cannot help but spend itself into oblivion.

            No. ‚ÄúImmigration‚Äù ‚Äî by which I mean flooding a white country with unskilled nonwhites ‚Äî is a symptom of the problem, not the problem itself. And the problem is white [and (((‚Äúwhite‚Äù))) ] leftist, globalist race-traitor elites are using nonwhites against traditional, nationalist whites.
The reason they do this is because they have adopted an international secular religion, where nonwhites (and queers and females) represent the highest moral virtue, and whiteness is the greatest sin.
This problem is occurring across the entire white western world, and it is the same white elites with their ersatz globalist religion behind it.

                This is why Christian nationalism, while not the desired endstate, is at present the only vehicle I can see which stands a chance against this mania in America.
The sodomites, catamites, pagans, and fedorians have to be made to see this.

            Things can always be worse.  Not shutting off immigration is surrender and yes it might be a hopeless cause but I don‚Äôt think most people understand what that type of surrender means.  It literally means mass murder of white people.  It means your suburb or exurb or even true rural area has Colony Ridges popping up nearby.  I could go on with the doom porn but most people here understand the end game.

        The absolute best outcome is that the harpy with the BLM sign in the front yard decides she is too good to live amongst unenlightened savages‚Ä¶and moves. A distant second-best outcome is Normie not wanting any part of this cancerous Regime and detaching from it. We see signs of both outcomes, too.As to the election, you are right. The people who vote for Trump primarily are not giving the system a middle finger. They are telling the Regime it has failed and they have no confidence in it. The despicable wine aunt with the BLM sign might have dirtied herself to vote for Nehra Nikki, but that is a regard action now.Dissolution and fragmentation is the present. The future is TBD.Maybe this is the silver lining of the open border, this clarification?

        Yesterday‚Äôs hilarious outcome in NH provided another window into just exactly HOW the Government rigs elections.  In this case, the open primary system.  Hillary Clinton famously said not long ago that the Democrats should only allow GOP leaders in the house ‚Äúacceptable to‚Äù‚Ä¶Democrats.  They get to pick our leaders, which is a great gig.We get preached to all the time about how secure our elections are, and that 2020 wasn‚Äôt a rigged election, ‚Äúno evidence‚Äù, that sort of thing.  But here we are in 2024 talking about how Democrats and eGOP members conspired to rig the NH Republican primary in order to advance a Democrat‚Äôs chances against Trump (now and in November).I think when people talk about NH today with friends, it‚Äôs important to point out that the vote rigging failed spectacularly, but vote rigging it was.  If the suburban peasant is going to wake up to this stuff, we have to constantly point out and remind them how their right to pick their leaders is being stolen from them by corrupt people with evil intent.Pressure will be placed on Nikki Romney to bow out.  Trump runs unopposed in NV next and then will beat the neocon whore in SC the following week, probably by similar or greater margins.  There are fewer Democrats in SC and Trump‚Äôs MAGA voters can now see the impact of the vote rigging‚Ä¶and show up in greater numbers to counter it.At the end of the day, Haley ‚Äúimproved‚Äù on her polling by 5% through vote rigging‚Ä¶but still lost by double digits‚Ä¶11% (as of this morning).There is an upper limit to vote rigging.

                But nobody pretended he was elected. That is the difference.Is is absolutely essential that the fraud gets dragged out into the sunlight.  The Kari Lake bribery offer (to get her off the 2024 ballot) is another.If you go back and look at the graphs from 2020, it was ‚Äújust enough‚Äù votes in ‚Äújust the right counties‚Äù in ‚Äújust enough states‚Äù to give Biden the W.They had North Carolina as a backup in case one of the others fell through, but they didn‚Äôt use it because it would have been harder to explain away.Anyway, you‚Äôre right, there‚Äôs no physical limit to fraud.  The limit is set by the risk of discovery.

They‚Äôre afraid Lake gets the VP nod from Trump.  She is brutal and would not only work Trump‚Äôs agenda, she‚Äôd destroy Harris and lead the overall election fraud counter offensive.  She knows first hand how it was done.

                Yes. White Americans are cowards. The feminine virtues of niceness and compassion rule the land. Even the few whites that really get what is going on are nervous about acknowledging the truth out if fear of being seen as the type of people to kill 6 million Jews.
We are a very long way from people being willing to be known as bad people.

At risk of committing the education=intelligence fallacy, this is probably not true. For every high-density 85 IQ complex, you would need an equal number of 115 IQ individualssomewhere&lt;/bto offset it. Since we know that kind of place does not exist, suburbs must necessarily be above average or the math doesn‚Äôt work. Most likely the suburbs are 1/2 to a full standard deviation above the mean.

Whites have plenty of underperformers. Even using what is often assumed to be the white mean of 105, one standard deviation below that goes clear down to 90 or so, who dominate our white/trailer trash and urban poor. They are not moving the black mean very far, and are largely not the ones in suburbs. That‚Äôs mostly college educated and those smart enough to be successful entrepreneurs, who are going to skew higher.

                The problem with midwits, and maybe I am one, is that they think they are far smarter than they are. Maybe this is the problem with democracy and get manipulated by those above them intelligence-wise. Plato said we need a philosopher-king ‚Äì a guy at the upper end of the bell curve, a genius with natural leadership, to rule the polis. He also said that the voting masses are fooled by smooth, slick talkers ‚Äì think of all the normies hoodwinked by Obama. Considering Plato also lived in a slave economy, he also understood that some people are simply meant to be ruled over, and better they be ruled over by the best than the worst, one who takes the interests of all of society into account. If you told Plato that voting would be given to everybody with a pulse, he would have said that would lead to chaos and tyranny, and sure enough‚Ä¶

                    I‚Äôd agree that‚Äôs a problem with democracy. Seems to me the answer, though, is to have as few things subject to mob rule as possible, i.e., use a more republican form of government. Or take it to the level of Jefferson, where whatever bad decisions you make mostly affect you, and it‚Äôs effects on others in the community a distant second order at most.

                        I think, if you take a step back, you come to understand that the path of the American experiment is the natural and normal path. The amount of people who would be allowed to get a say in ‚Äúour sacred democracy‚Äù can only go in one direction, and the resulting chaos could only be solved by more centralized power and tyranny. You can‚Äôt put the toothpaste back in the tube as time goes on. We are at the point now where Democrats are advocating for children and hardened felons to vote (in jail, if necessary). It‚Äôs completely over. The idea that we can get back to a Jeffersonian republic if only we implemented the right policies is what conservatives have been crowing about for decades.Indeed, this path from democracy to tyranny was also described by Plato.

            I‚Äôm in California and the MSNBC-watcher white shitlibs I know viscerally despise Nikki Hillary (also like to complain about TX governor Abbott in the last two months‚Äì some rando they‚Äôd never heard of last year; Pavlovian programming is real). Until last week, they also ostentatiously hated Ron D and I distinctly recall prattle about him being ‚Äúworse than Trump,‚Äù for depriving all the little scholars of Kama Sutra library books.On the other hand I don‚Äôt detect much enthusiasm for vegetable President/embarrassment VP. Usually they will gush religiously over any PoC charlatan sent up by the media that week so it is all too obvious by omission w/ the latter. Their inchoate suspicion about Hunter Biden‚Äôs international business and art careers is that everything is exaggerated, a frame-up, etc. which is the hangover of 2016 partisan-all-the-time still. According to them Trump sexually assaulted dozens or hundreds of women as well as paid them all hush money, which is either illegal or needs to be made illegal for Trump right away. Mostly they love to worship celebrities like The Squad. They never talk about vaccines now, that may be a general respectability collapse around the issue out here though. Lefties I know genuinely believed at the time the Coof was the new megadeath outbreak strain a la the movie versions and the issue today leaves them at a social disadvantage no matter what the context.The more startling thing to me as an L.A. native is this set seems uniformly to consider Israel bad and low-class now, which must mean the allergic reaction to evangelical Zionist groupies under G.W. Bush has actually accelerated. I used to not observe this outside of university professors and lawyers but it‚Äôs a sea change. The reason the Pentagon goes hard in the paint on LGBT is last-propaganda-standing to emotionally resonate with the modern center-left bloc, who otherwise might be semi-consciously isolationist. If they could figure out a way to show Derek Chauvin kneeling on Zelensky, and also make Zelensky black, that would do dynamite box-office. Alas they have to resort to Two Mommies stuff instead, and that‚Äôs the likely ultimate fate of other left-liberal human rights imperialisms.Oh yeah, couldn‚Äôt forget‚Äì My local liberal milieu deem immigration as sensationalized but also society has to be upended completely to integrate however many billions come, which is The Right Thing To Do. Some of them believe.this zealously, others are more.whistling past the graveyard. The worst of all worlds is unbosomimg.an opinion that makes you look low-status in front of a black or mestizo, or failing that, a South Asian (very prominent in left circles here).

        In 2016, a vote for the Bad Orange Man was a protest, and a middle finger to the Vichy Right. In 2020, a vote for the BOM was a hope that elections still mattered. In 2024, a vote for the BOM is a vote for civil war, initiated by the Left. The BOM is Lincoln in 1860, but not in that utterly retarded DR3 formulation. The result will be the same.

            Maybe. I‚Äôm beginning to worry that they *won‚Äôt* rig the election this time. All the chitchat I‚Äôm hearing now, based on WEF comments, weird political opinion pieces, the sudden appearance of White men in Army recruiting ads, and so on is that {shrew team B, the Thermidorian reaction} have decided Trump is a better option.

                If they do allow it, the purpose will be to pin on Trump the upcoming economic collapse and to have him act as the Judas goat to recruit white soldiers. The former would work, the latter would not at this point.

        ‚Äù When the ends of one side are the destruction of the other, the only plausible response for the other side is to seek the same.‚ÄùThe BLM signs ‚Äî and covid masks ‚Äî are all over my neighborhood where the typical suburban peasant hasn‚Äôt got a chance. The latter has Trump and a bunch of votes. The former‚Äôs got power of which the latter can only dream.These fantasies of ‚Äútaking the country back‚Äù are just that. The disaffected and disenfranchised can kick ass at the margins ‚Äî beat up on a few minorities here and there ‚Äî but their/our days are done.What, then, is next? Prep for the collapse if you can. And learn to speak Church Latin as it‚Äôs coming up on the year 476 redux.

            This is a feature for the elites though. Even if all the White men quit the military, we are still going to have a military. It‚Äôs just going to be full of people who hate Whitey and want him dead, and they are going to be armed and given the power to do it when called upon. Just because a bureaucracy and government is full of stupid, cruel, wicked people doesn‚Äôt mean it cannot carry out the functions it desires ‚Äì see the Bolsheviks.All evidence points to the fact that the elites don‚Äôt want smart, driven, competent White people in charge of key institutions and professions, even ones like medicine, because they believe that the peasants should suffer. We don‚Äôt deserve things like heat, air conditioning, personal transport, vacations, red meat, functioning stoves, medicine, freedom of association, freedom of speech, right to bear and arms, a retirement plan, a good education for our children, peaceful neighborhoods, clean sidewalks, a police force that we can call upon when needed, open space, and who knows what else. New stuff gets added to the list weekly.

                It is a feature, and it will likely make things suck for us at home, but the panic over Whites not joining the military underscores the reality that without competent Whites the world will mop the floor with us.  Thus, dreams of global dominance are disappearing with each non-White enlistment.

                    The fake news story this week about Russia reclaiming Alaska elicited two reactions from young white Americans: utterly insane ‚Äúmolon labe‚Äù bloodlust from the educated/gay/female, and from the kind of guy who used to join the US military, kidding on the square, ‚ÄúWe should move there to greet them as liberators.‚Äù
It probably doesn‚Äôt matter, but at least they know.
