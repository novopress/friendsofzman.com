        The UN’s low population projection (which is the one that uses realistic projections of fertility)has the world’s population peaking around 2030 at between 8 and 8.5 billion people. Thereafter, the world’s population slowly declines, and the world becomes an older, less productive and less innovative place.

        Wealth equals efficiency. Wealth finds new ways to consume, new resources, and new technology to use resources in more efficient ways. What the world really can’t stand is billions of people consuming like rural Chinese or Africans.
I wish enviros knew things, they might be worth engaging in conversation if they did.

        I might also add, regarding Ukraine, that it has one of the lowest birth rates in the world. It hit a low in 2001 of 1.08 live births per woman, and even though it had rebounded to 1.53 in 2012, that is still very much below mere replacement rate.Most of the rest of Europe is no higher or not much higher, and of the major European NATO powers, only the UK and France are higher.  Germany and Italy are in a race for the bottom of all Europe. Poland, which would be key terrain in defending either Ukraine or the NATO-member Baltic states, has a birth rate only marginally higher.So my question to anyone proposing such military action by the United States: if the European nations threatened by Russia will not have children to grow up to defend their own nations, why should we ask American women to bear children to go defend those nations?

        I think in the last paragraph you meant to type “descendants” instead of “ancestors.”

        Declining birthrate = declining civilization.

        Too many people chasing declining resources. Less people is a good thing – only economists think otherwise. The ecology and environment can’t withstand billions of people consuming like Americans.
