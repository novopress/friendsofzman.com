        Islam may be dying, at least in terms of a recognisable entity, but it is going to give one hell of a kick before it is eventually absorbed into western materialism.On the other hand, if western materialism is so anxious to shoot itself in the foot (and the head) then Islam may as well hang on and become the dominant force in the Middle East, Europe, North Africa and, er, North America.Watch for then the Chinese/Russian bloc (aided by their interests in middle to southern Africa and probably India) to confront the death cult. It wouldn’t surprise me, if Europe and the US stumble to their self-inflicted doom, that South America will be eventually recruited to the Chinese side.Who would have thought that the Pacific will become battleground between the Obama-legacy muslims and blacks of the US and Canada and the commie-based Chinese and Russians? A second Midway perhaps… Now that will be an interesting confrontation.

        They said they’ll get some if Iran will get some, even buying it off the shelf from Pakistan (“I’ll have 3 chicken tikka massalas and yes, I’d like some nuclear bombs to go with that. And extra naan bread.”)I’m sure they will. I imagine Turkey will too. Or perhaps Iran will bomb Turkey if it tries, once Iran has the bomb. All kinds of interesting times await us thanks to Obama. All thanks to Obama. And this discussion should be a matter of national debate but somehow it isn’t. The left doesn’t care for that sort of talk.

            Neither does the GOPe. They were happy to go along with the Iran deal. It was a two-fer for their K Street pay master’s. Huge $$’s to be made from Iran and Obama signing off on the TPP means even more cash. Remember McConnell saying how easy the TPP negotiations were going? The fix was in from the get-go.

            If we hadn’t invaded Iraq in 2003, Obama would have had no opportunity for the pea-brained exercises he’s been conducting in that neighborhood — and there’s a strong case that the progressive wave that swept him into office wouldn’t have happened on the same scale without Bush doing such dumb things over there.
I voted for Bush and I supported his stupid wars but I wish I hadn’t. On the other hand, I’m not ashamed I didn’t support his loathsome and moronic enemies.
Tough times all around.

                Wow. So true and you’re the first to say it.General Garner and the military would’ve had the “boot on their neck, gun in their face” Footprint wrapped up in two years.  So Garner was fired and a megalomaniac from State, Bremer, was brought in and kept in to ruin everything in an orgy of corruption.  (Over in Afghanistan, Omar and the Taliban were Pakistan’s puppet government anyway, making them ‘our’ puppets as well.)Bush was silent about the anti-war movement.He proclaimed Islam was the religion of peace.He did everything he could to encourage a Progressive anti-war movement with a pro-Islamic veneer (and tons of cashola for everyone)….The fix was in?

                    Eh.  That’s a stretch, I was too hasty.
But you’re absolutely right, without Iraq, there might’ve been no Obama.
(I regret that I too fell for it, and defended the booswash, until a black mechanic put it plainly- “So, why we there?”)
Bush had never simply, plainly answered the question.  No, you tell me, Mr. Bush, one sentence- why we there?  Don’t make me guess.
And don’t say “fight ‘me over there” while we keep building mosques here.

                I agree with this. I was fine with going over to Afghanistan, knocking everything over and killing all the males. We had the right. My mistake with Iraq is I never believed them with regards to bringing democracy to the region. I thought that was just bullshit. I figured it the result would be some new strong man along the lines of what we had in Egypt.That said, most of what we are seeing would have happened regardless. The forces tearing through Islam were always there. The Cold War kept a lid on things, but once that ended, the bankers and businessmen were free to rush in and flip over the arrangements.

                    Thank you!There’s a reason Congress is erecting a statue of “I think he’s a hero” Dick Cheney in DC.
His war profits are now buying up eastern Nevada, expanding his Wyoming fiefdom.
I guess his battle experience in evading the draft 5 times made him fit to be Secretary of Defense under the Global Godfather, Pappy.

                        Oh, and quite right about the Cold War keeping a lid on it.  The Saudis supply our military fuel, priority #1.
I’ve said secular Nasserite socialism was a necessary step to bring the 83 IQ Muslims into the modern world.
Burkas were almost extinct until both the KGB and CIA resurrected jihad doctrine in Afghanistan
Heaven forbid those atheist Russians should introduce female doctors and engineers- but all those deeply religious customers might have kept trading for oil in rubles!

                    Iran had been buying up the old hulks of the Soviet Arsenal from Kazakstan, Belarus, and Ukraine, and plutonium from No. Korea, for years.
Perhaps one reason Bush and Obama danced around Iran is because Iran is already nuclear.
(Been hearing that “Someday Soon” chant every year since 1979.)

        Islam is not “dying”. Just because Muslims suffer from Islam’s pathologies doesn’t mean Islam is dying. Not even that it’s weakening. It would be in decline (or dying) if Muslims would keep it at arm’s length, or abandon it, or simply were to have below-replacement demographics. None of these things is happening (other than perhaps in Iran). Quite the opposite. Even while Islamic societies get poorer and turn their countries into hellholes, Islam thrives. Now they’re turning Germany et al into hell holes and if the process is left to continue, Islam will conquer Europe. So much for ‘dying’.
