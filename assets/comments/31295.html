        Sometimes I just shake my head when people say “The collapse is coming! Any day now!”The collapse has already happened.  We have a Government that is now openly targeting and jailing its political opposition using criminal charges that are questionable at best or just plain fake.  They have invented absurd crimes to prosecute Trump, and J6 protesters who were escorted around the Capitol by police (who were friendly and chatty) are rotting in prison.  Cop a plea or back to solitary!There are cities in this country that are so far gone as to not resemble anything American. Absolute hell holes that represent everything “Diversity is our strength” promised.  Wars…everywhere!It doesn’t have to look like the zombie apocalypse to be a collapse.

        Apparently, military morale is collapsing, as blessings of diversity are bestowed on the US military.

        Collapse is now rapid, ongoing, and irreversible.We are now at war with Iran/Yemen, over the Houthis blockade of the Suez Canal / Red Sea. Expect at least one sunken carrier. Collapse.The Pope has basically made Gay Marriage a Catholic Sacrament. Collapse.The Draft is coming. Don’t be fooled, Lloyd Austen does not make that sort of threat without there having been months of planning for just that — drafting of White guys (probably up to age 60 and run like Ukraine — vibrants in vans abducting White dudes for the Russian Front). Collapse.There is a new movie out by Hollywood depicting California’s Gay Army of Vibrants overthrowing Trumpland and making gay mandatory. Collapse.Meanwhile Fort Hood cannot even feed its soldiers on base, most are having to travel off base and use food stamps to get one meal a day. There are just not enough cooks and food to operate the full number of mess halls, so soldiers not near mess halls simply don’t get fed.

            In Iraq and Afghanistan, for whatever reason, they outsourced the mess halls to private contractors. (KBR/Halliburton). Doesn’t seem so hard to do for stateside mess halls. Or are they having the same problem as restaurants everywhere and not able to hire people?

        Over the weekend I saw a story about a crane being moved into place to start dismantling the civil war reconciliation monument at Arlington National Cemetery today. The monument was dedicated by Calvin Coolidge. I missed it when it happened but it seems that for some reason that I can’t fathom, Congress, including 41 Republicans, voted to remove it. I guess the current Federal government’s position is that the civil war is still ongoing. Will the military start attacking targets in the former Confederacy?  This country is just getting too weird.

            This is the brain dead regime agony. In Ukraine they also take down Russian monuments because they don,t know how to stop collapse.When they cant fight on Russian Army, at least they can fight with Tchaikovsky who is dead 130 years but monument still standing.1945 Hitler spent hours with Albert Speer discussing how to rebuild Germany after the victory. In that time, nobody in Germany had no ideas anymore how to win.And in the Soviet Union, in the very end propaganda reached unlimited heights because this was all they had left.This war with monuments is actually good sign. They have no ideas what to do with opposition. Comrade Stalin did not fought with monuments, he had better ideas what to do with disobedient people.

                Juri: “…at least they can fight with Tchaikovsky who is dead 130 years but monument still standing…”
Tchaikovsky’s 2nd Symphony is known as the “Little Russian” symphony.
“Little Russia” being a nickname for Ukraine, which, in turn, is a nickname for Khazaria.

        I dunno Z.One of the curious things I am seeing is a distinct similarity between present day America and pre-collapse Soviet Union: useless old geezers in positions of real power. In the Soviet Union it used to be that guys like you and I would be considered men. Anyone under the age of 40 would be considered a boy. Mature men, suitable for serious leadership were in their 70s. Watching the antics of Biden, Pelosi, McConnel, Graham, the Clintons and the Obuttholes… yeesh…. they have amassed so much money and power by bankrupting the kids that we can never recover. So it goes for alot of their flunkies and fart catchers in the institutions and managerial class too – old people are by nature selfish, childish and vindictive. There are some notable exceptions of people that can still function into advanced age like Putler and maybe Trump… but they are the exception, not the rule.I suppose they are a part of the growing competency crises.

        “The Deep State can’t control us without electricity.” ~ often notedI’d say the Globalist Deep State, the militarized BankCorp economy (with NATO/Navy as world police) can win.The hill at least, for a time.1. A cyber event mimicking an EMP as the nuclear strike.  (It makes a real EMP by a contending power irrelevant.)2. Illegals Army as the mop-up forces for an already balkanized nation(Demographically, culturally, 15 minute city zonas, take your pick).So something new is being born, a jigsaw assembly from the pieces of the old.Steered?

                Mr. Zoar, this reminds me of the Middle Eastern style of fighting.They don’t go directly to it; both sides take turns kicking the old lady in the street to show who’s tougher.A bit longish, but from my web notes:The contrived antisemitism / Palestinian protest crisis is basically BLM, but this time with Muslims.“The fake antisemitism lawsuits against US universities are led by the law firm of Trump’s ex-amb to Israel, David Friedman The firm has registered as a foreign agent of an Israeli It also represented co-defendants of Ihor Kolomoisky,…——–David Friedman is also a prolific hasbara shill on Twitter, to no one’s surprise.David Friedman was a bankruptcy lawyer and Trump was his client.——–Kolomoisky basically funded Zelensky’s electoral campaign to prevent the war, as it would have been detrimental to his assets, but Azov&amp;co, which yes, he funded in the beginning, were dead set on getting their hands on the Donbass people, and Kolomoisky got caught into that(he was accused of fraud, and likely he was guilty, it’s Ukraine, but it was obviously political; he was also added to the US sanctions’ list if I recall correctly).[And currently lives in New Jersey- A.]Also note that the oligarchs related to the Burisma affair, had been granted ownerships of resources in the Donbass,so ofc his prosecution was political (lawfare, one might say) and as such I wouldn’t be this surprised, that he used the same lawyer as Trump.——–Kolomoisky the colourful oligarch with Bond-inspired office shark tank. For real!”The mishmash above tells me “intrigue afoot, internal politics.”Now, Eric Prince depends on government contracts, so I’d say he’s putting out an ad sign.  I heard the same about Russian suitcase nukes and Iranian cells during the Bush War years.May I contend that Iranian cells coupled with Palestinian protests make us the old lady in the street;The usual suspects are yelling to their respective audiences, “no, I’m the one who’ll protect you…from him!” as they scuffle in the other room.Play both sides; no matter who loses, one will win, so the player will already have a stake in the winning side.

            p.s.- I don’t think they’ll “pull it” for the 2024 election.  They’re leaking CyberEvent 201 and are flooding our nations with the huddled masses for the implied threat.
Like nuclear MAD, the implied threat will be enough.
We know and they know they could if they wanted.  A domestic “military exercise”, a show of arms.

            I agree. to an extent. I dunno about ‘the army of illegals’ though. Those guys are mostly low IQ, low skill human trash. The US military is actively selecting for them especially in leadership positions and has the laughable results to show for it.I personally think the looming financial and societal collapse are going to herald a return to seriousness and a lot of those guys and the clowns are going to go away – if they know what’s good for them. A lot of these leftist govts are going to start falling soon too. We are in for a world of hurt.You can’t run a country like this, as we are seeing.

        Thank you for noticing the insanity of a certain Internet group when it comes to the Ukraine. I absolutely believe there are pro-Nazi groups in the Ukraine working for Jewish billionaires, thanks to them. It appears people are so desperate to belong to any group that any intellectual pap straight from the groups they claim to hate is acceptable.Ukraine’s Z man is an actual Jew with dual citizenship privileges. He’s an installed puppet and by trade an actor.  Putin is an ethnic Russian who has had to work with global powers for decades. But it’s Putin that’s the secret Jew lover. You can’t make this stuff up. There’s not enough /facepalm emojis in the world for the line of thinking.

            In hindsight, Yugoslavia made no sense. It was a patchwork of cultures and religions with deep rivalries and hatreds. Under the rule of a strongman, Tito, Yugoslavia seemed to “work”. The truth is that no one in that country (except maybe the Apparat) identified as “Yugoslav”. They were Serbs, Bosnians, Slovenians, Croatians, Montenegrans… even Romanians and Greeks. My point is that Yugoslavia was never really a coherent “society” and its collapse was entirely predictable once the pressure of authoritarian rule was relaxed.

        ‘On the other hand, liberal democracies have shown an ability to self-correct. The money supply and the military were a mess in the 1970’s until they were fixed.’1970s America was run by men, and the smaller towns mostly by Christian men.  That nation was so superior in almost every way to current Amerika that words fail me.Modern America is run by women and various tribes, most of whom strive to obliterate the last vestiges of 1970s (and prior) America.  So far, they’ve been massively successful at their goals.  There is dissent, surely, but I see no ‘self-correction’ whatsoever.  Quite the opposite.As for the military, I was USAF ’71-’75.  All my assignments were stateside, but the bases I worked at were efficient and effective.  Jobs got done, medical and dental, good food, lots of camaraderie.  Again, run by men of experience.Most of the men I worked with in the military are a significant upgrade from what I found in civilian life following separation.  As for comparing those military men to what exists now, it is to laugh.The men I know now in the military, or separated within the past decade, tell of a Fundamentally Transformed military that is a woke-fem nightmare.  They all either want to get out or are glad they got out.The New Military, like the New Amerika, is the mess.  The military of the 1970s was positively spit-shined Prussian, compared to the pathetic joke the U.S. armed forces are now.  Capable men are fleeing it left and right.

Women are very fine indeed.  Provided they are not encouraged and funded to become men/masculine, and provided they are restricted from all civil and church position and power.
If they aren’t restricted, evil elements use tested, mass methods to co-opt them collectively.  Those Fine Women then destroy all that is good, while shouting of their oppression.

        “despite the fact that there are no signs of it.”I don’t know why you’re saying this unless you’re trying to provoke some animated responses. You yourself have written about the decline and imminent fall of the GAE several times. True, you haven’t quite said the USA will collapse internally because of loss of the empire, but it could follow as a consequence.“You can point to current trends and say they could one day lead to collapse, something like the systemic abuse of the money supply or the degradation of the American military. On the other hand, liberal democracies have shown an ability to self-correct. The money supply and the military were a mess in the 1970’s until they were fixed.”If we confine ourselves to the GAE some makeshift and band-aid responses to the crises of the ’70s were devised but no permanent fixes. The untethered dollar continues to be a problem. The volunteer army of today is no panacea either. It’s a bit like the situation in Zelazny’s “Lord of Light”, which I know you’ve read. The establishment keeps winning each time, but emerges weaker with each so-called “victory.”As for what collapse looks like, let us refer to Tainter on page 19, quoting Casson:“the Allied troops … found a city that was dead.  The Turkish government had just ceased to function.  The electrical supply had failed and was intermittent.  Tramways did not work and abandoned trams littered the roads.  There was no railway service, no street cleaning and a police force which had largely become bandit, living on blackmail from citizens in lieu of pay.  Corpses lay at street corners and in side lanes, dead horses were everywhere, with no organization to remove them.  Drains did not work and water was unsafe.  All this was the result of only about three weeks’ abandonment by the civil authorities of their duties.”It’s not too far-fetched to imagine chunks of the USA in this situation. Not tomorrow certainly but not too far ahead either.

            When Soviet union went down, I was 16 so I remember this day well. On the evening of 18th august 1991 we all went to sleep with knowledge that Soviet Union is in bad shape but nothing catastrophic in sight so it will last years or even decades.Yet next morning we had tanks on the streets and after 3 day mess, 73 years of madness was gone. US with its enormous financial sector and very little producing is much more vulnerable. Stock market and financial system may blow off at any moment.When shortages kick in, local Governments are forced to act. Like our guys. They liked their comfortable corruption but in 19th august 1991 they were faced with horrific choice. Immediate return of Stalinism or rapid demolition of the system. So they acted and the rest is history. I think that Western communism is also one serious event away from collapse.

            I sometimes play a little “collapse game” with my immediate surroundings. I imagine what will happen if/when the paychecks stop or lose all value. In the case of my neighborhood we have a bunch of ugly, Soviet-style 6-8 floor slab apartments dressed up as ghetto art-deco – ghetto-deco? In the first month after the music stops I can see:1) Probably the only blessing to expect: the obnoxious Pajeets who are now like 65% of the neighborhood self-deport back to India realizing that of all the various AINO races, the only one that doesn’t hate them is… themselves.2) The 100% beaner maintenance crews that do the half-assed repairs on the buildings strip the copper wiring and plumbing to sell on the black market. They also use their skeleton keys to brazenly steal the appliances from everyone’s apartments when they are not home.3) The mostly vacant buildings, now with no electric power or running water start to burn down as local homeless move in and start campfires and drug cooking operations.4) The remaining non-beaner, non-Pajeet Whites, consisting almost entirely of queers, soyboys, and stronk-wammen panics as they realize they have no real skills and no convenient alternate country to run back to. I predict that some of the more charismatic queers start religious cults that all the others enthusiastically join. This will probably involve cannibalism.Yes, there’s a bit of facetious hyperbole here but the real problem is one that’s common throughout the former USA. This “community” was fabricated from scratch on empty land and the current population is entirely bug people who know only a “transactional” mode of living. There are parts of the US where people can fall back on local traditions and community standards to weather a collapse. This is not one of them. This place will go from being fake ‘n ghey “upscale” to zombie apocalypse almost overnight if things go far enough sideways. I’ve read parts of Orlov’s essay too and I can easily see my area being an exemplar of what can happen when you no longer have the kind of rudiments of an organic society as still existed in the Soviet Union in ’91.

        Z-man gives too much credit to democracies self-correcting.  That may have been the case when democracies were homogenous societies with high trust.  These new “democracies” are corrupt rackets ruling over a polyglot of people who dislike each other.I got an earful of unreality this weekend listening to a Hoover Institute podcast about standing up to China.  The two “experts” insisted that the US can’t back down in the Mideast, or Ukraine or Taiwan, (or North Korea) all while admitting that the US military is on its ass, with too few ships, too few munitions, too few men, and no industrial base.  But, by golly, if Reagan could do it so can we!Sorry fellas.  That America is long gone.  This new country is flooded with foreigners, 32 trillion in debt and run by crooks.  All the white folks who put Humpty-Dumpty together in the 80s are collecting social security.

Sure, from a practical (technological) perspective things still work – although a bit less well.
The real story is the moral and religious collapse, which has happened very rapidly. And it is continuing, as far as I can see it. I mean, what good is it if ChatGPT can do you programming day job for you as you sit at home on a couch; when a thousand Tyrones hoot and holler outside and some dementia patient is The Prez?

        Is Z’s comment sincere on Dutton’s book? Seems like an interesting read over the break. Or am I missing some snark in his comment? Genuine question, for I follow absolutely no other political commentary site than this, so names such as Dutton and Derbyshire are only, for me, heard here, and I know nothing about their output and can easily miss sarcasm.

            Derbyshire is the original curmudgeon from whom the Zman will take the torch from someday.He was famously fired from National Review for publishing “The Talk” in another publication which had some eminently practical talk about racial realities in America.  He’s been doing a podcast forever, has a great British accent (he’s a naturalized US citizen), speaks Chinese, is a solid mathematician, and like Jared Taylor, is a complete gentleman. Main topic is immigration but he also covers other things.Buy a used copy of his book “We are Doomed”.  It’s great.Dutton is a bit of a youtube personality.  Mostly known for presentations about IQ.“At Our Wits’ End: Why We’re Becoming Less Intelligent and What it Means for the Future ” is his most famous work.  Nothing you won’t read elsewhere from the IQ researcher greats, but more direct and more fun.———-TLDR; I’ll get a copy of Dutton’s book based on the Zman’s recommendation.

                    Fair enough.
Derb really showed me how gutless the entire NRO/Republican “conservative” apparatus was when they dumped him like a hot rock over “The Talk” article. Whole party beyond redemption ever since.
He’s never apologized for it either, so good for him.

            Hullo, Hullo, Hullo… Well, Zman just moved homes; so I’d bet that the comment about watching paint dry is literally true. Why would he urge the purchase of two copies, if his crypto-message was that he’d be taking down Dutton’s book with a “damning with faint praise” review? While Zman doesn’t strike me as subscribing to Charles Haywood’s dictum of No Enemies On The Right; he has mentioned on more than one occasion that if he strongly disagrees with someone, he usually remains silent about them.Ed Dutton is not shy. He’s very clear about his views and opinions. If his cup of tea is agreeable, buy his book. Otherwise, don’t.Personally, I find the “why” of spiteful mutants entertaining but unnecessary. The solution resides more in a “Fuck you, that’s why!” approach that is more swift and final. See TomA for details.

        I disagree that collapse won’t happen. Au contraire, I don’t see how it can be long-delayed. Sure, as Adam Smith, said, there is indeed a lot of ruin in a nation. However, the rot in our Western societies is simply do deep and on too many levels to guarantee any lengthy breathing space. Also, the rebirth of Russia after 1991 and Germany after 1945 are not good examples. These places, despite their horrific suffering, still had some kind of a unified culture and history. Russia had a strong Christian sub-culture that communist couldn’t destroy. What do we have? Nothing at all that binds us together. We’ve ditched any religious belief and what has replaced it (equity, anyone?) is worthless Woke dross. Things will happen slowly, then suddenly, probably expedited by an event or events that no-one predicted. I view this as a positive development. I hate our current Woke societies with all my heart and want them swept into the trashcan of history, even if it means personal pain to me.

            Of course, Christ is the way.
On the subject of collapse, I do believe that various parts of The System have collapsed or are collapsing. But, the sheer scale and inter-connectedness of The System means that, overall, no collapse is seen.
Then, when another part of The System gets better, it picks up the weight of another faltering part. It just seems to me like that is what’s happening…
Naturally, this means a proper collapse will take a long time and require a lot of Evil. But Evil is on the rise.

            Regardless of what it looks like, “Collapse” is not going to save us from SJWs. (abandon the word “woke”)  The only way to defeat them is to physically defeat them and removing them from power.  Why would anyone believe “collapse” is going to save them from SJWs/Wokeness anyway?  “Collapse” is far more likely to defeat us than it is to defeat them.  They are the wealthy connected elite who control most of the levers of power in the country.

You may be correct in your assessment, but we should never forget that history is littered with stories of powerful elites who were dragged from their palaces and slaughtered while the masses cheered.
Will that happen here? It seems unlikely. But of course, it always seems unlikely until it actually happens.

            I don’t consider the rebirth of these lands in the same terms as post-war Germany or post-communism Russia.  You’ve outlined the reasons why things can’t be the same.  It’s a fool’s errand to try to predict what will rise from the ashes, but in general it will be more local in scope and there will be some blood shed, otherization, and forced migration on the road to the eventual solution.

        All countries go through cycles of death and rebirth.  What keeps them in-tact during this process was as Pat Buchanan described as “blood and soill” which sounded far too Neo-Nazi for the DC area to digest.  But he was simply remarking on thousands of years of history.  Since our secular religion puts the year zero at 1960 with the election of JFK, and events before that, however important, considered ancient, this concept has been completely shut out of our brains.  Instead we have opted for another ancient systemic model, that of Babylon.  A country of strangers  engaging in commerce.  The USSR was such a model, only without the commerce which made it unworkable.   But when the dust settled a Pole was still a Pole, a  Russian still a Russian, an Armenian still an Armenian, etc.The bigger question is what are we, the U.S..?  When the dust settles on our collapse what will the blood and soil dividing lines be like?  Who will own what?   What is our culture if the mall burns down and Amazon stops delivering?   Will be all gather around mullatto NFL quarterbacks as the media will keep telling us to?

            That’s what I was hinting at below.  If Poland collapses, the Poles just make a new one.  If the U.S. collapses, there’s no telling how ugly it gets or what emerges.

            I’m pretty sure year zero is 1945.  This is why they can never shut up about you know who.  The founding myth is how we all came together and defeated the Nazis.
OTOH, it may be more accurate to say year zero is context specific and quite flexible.  It could be 1865, 1913, 1945, 1965 etc depending on which one serves The Narrative best in whatever the context happens to be.

                1945 is a good chalk like to draw, but to these people culture is more important than winning wars, it’s “all about the music.”  You have to pick the point where our society became permanently juvenile.

                If you read the book “The Cultural Cold War – The CIA and the  World of Arts and Letters” by Frances Stonor Suanders, you’ll come to the conclusion that pretty much any book written after the 1930’s or so is government directed propaganda.It’s much worse in Europe (see:  CIA funded/directed “Congress for Cultural Freedom”), but this book will send you down the rabbit hole of professional propagandists like Jacques Ellul and Edward Barnays.Very little, if any, of the information we’ve grown up in doesn’t have a huge thumb on the “balanced information” scale since the adoption of mass media.

                    JR Wirth: Sounds nice but I wouldn’t count on it.  Too much accumulated wealth from generations of working White people for the invaders to take.  And even our faltering infrastructure is far better than what they had at home.  Many of these people are unaccustomed to running potable water and indoor toilets.
Personally, I wouldn’t bet on many of them leaving voluntarily.   Even the Chicago joggers have been told to stop complaining about sharing all the gibs by the money men who run things.

                        I concur with this assessment. Our garbage cans are better than their shopping malls. Even as conditions continue to deteriorate, this will pale in contrast when we imagine how much further the 3rd world will devolve (and is already).

                        You haven’t traveled much. I have flown more than 3 million miles on one airline alone.
Majority of the 100+ countries I have visited enjoy superior infrastructure in comparison with the US. “Even Mexico” in most areas.
Sure, Bangladesh and Myanmar are terrible. Those less developed countries are exceptions. The Arab, S. American and E. Asian countries invested in their respective infrastructures and this shows.
The US “invested” everywhere else. They’ve hated us for a very long time.

                        I’m no jingoistic lover of the USA, but to say that you could pick out 100 countries and that a majority of them would have better infrastructure than the U.S. is a bit much.  For example, how many of those countries would have potable tap water in nearly 100% of the country?In the summer of 2002, I took a bus from Siem Riep to Bangkok.  It took us nearly 8 hours to go the 150 miles from Siem Riep to the Thai border.  After going through the border checkpoint, I remembering feeling like Dorothy as she walks out of her B&amp;W house into the technicolor of Oz.  Suddenly there were ATMs, convenience stores, and paved roads.  But even then, the Thai infrastructure wasn’t comparable to most anywhere in the U.S.  Decent, yes, but not better.You mentioned Myanmar.  A week after the above trip I arrived in Yangon and spent 3 weeks traveling the country.  Even Burma had better infrastructure at that time than Cambodia, Vietnam, or much of western China, probably because they were still coasting on the fumes of Great Britain.  As far as Asia goes, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and swaths of China have comparable infrastructure to the United States but beyond that it’s not happening.  And places like Japan have great infrastructure because the Liberal Democratic Party inflated GDP growth and enjoyed electoral success by funding just about any proposed internal project.  It was said that by the 80’s there wasn’t a waterway worth its salt in all of Japan that hadn’t had its banks paved.  The CCP has done much of the same in China.  But in America, our political parties have funded their political viability through more targeted and personal gibs.

            This is spot on JR Wirth. We have to answer the question of what are we? On the one hand, we are the common enemy around which the other tribe’s identity and purpose exists. Our survival and the fight against our dispossession will be our immediate purpose. However, it is up to us to define who we are and our ultimate purpose at a transcendant level. Many will be lost to despair or to atomized individualism that works until it doesn’t.The Remnant will be those with the mental health to use the survival instinct. At some point it/we will have to decide who we are and what our purpose is. I think we will make the correct decisions and then at some point our posterity will undertake a new multi-thousand year run of transcendence.

        “It is as if the people in that [dissident] pro-Ukraine subculture were given a potion by the neocons that causes them to repeat all of their most absurd claims, without realizing they are parroting the people they claim to oppose.”Quite a lot of the Kool-Aid gets drunk in our sphere. Take art. Nothing separates the establishment from ordinary folk more than abstract art does. Basically, it’s a grift wherein self-appointed critics tell wealthy collectors what is or isn’t a worthy investment. No one, not least the hoi polloi, can make heads or tails of the paint splatters, so it’s all purely subjective. It’s also highly subversive because it breaks the cultural bond between the artist and their spectators. Yet browse the portfolio of dissident artists and what are you likely to see? Note that even subversives will stoop to representational art when they want to peddle grooming books to our children. Shouldn’t “our guys” be in this space, too?In terms of education, Counter-Currents is surely a worthy effort to counter the liberalism that has come to permeate our society. Greg Johnson recently announced the Homeland Institute “to explore the negative effects of globalization and multiculturalism on historic homelands and to propose workable and humane alternatives.” Brilliant! Then pro bono Executive Director David Zsutty was heard saying on their podcast that we need to go to war with China. Something about gaining strength through existential struggle. Not sure how our mestizo fighting-age population feels about it, but isn’t that case already being made well enough by a plethora of Neoconservative media outlets?

            Hi Gideon –Szutty was not proposing that we go to war with China. He is thinking through the future of military structures and how our people will dominate them. His comments on China were not arguing for war with them, but he does see them as a serious threat to our nation. He didn’t elaborate on why or how they are threatening. At some point I would like to understand why and how he sees it that way. For now, he is rightly focused on the most immediate threat.I think the Homeland Institute and the White Papers Policy Institute are very positive emergent institutions representing our folk.

                I may have misheard Mr Zsutty, because we came away with different takes. And I agree that Counter-Currents and the Homeland Institute are important initiatives.But if China is a direct threat to America, we’re really screwed, since after half a century of building them up we now rely on that and other countries’ manufactured goods and willingness to purchase U.S. Treasuries to pay for them. Conflict with Russia may leave us humiliated; conflict with China could easily impoverish us.My larger point is that we cannot offer any real alternatives to the establishment paradigm if we largely accept its premises. If forced to pick an enemy, for example, I’d choose the millions of fighting-age men crossing our southern border, even if only for pragmatic reasons. It would yield a likely victory without nearly as much risk. Preserving a homeland for ourselves would be huge bonus.

                    Cool. I think your description of the threat from China and its position is what concerns Szutty.
I look at the photos and videos of who lines the streets of NY waiting for their hotel rooms and handouts and it is chilling. The wilds of Africa are streaming across the border. I don’t disagree that the border, and the organized direct flights as well are threat number one.
Mayorkas and whoever is behind him is the head of the snake.

        this is a thought experiment but I’m curious as to what the second order effects would be. If they were to demolish every major big box store and replace it with either single family homes or with a central park-style “greenspace” would traffic actually go down?
Or would the traffic simply be replaced by delivery trucks from amazon or what have you

        The title of this piece gets it right, and the operative word is “long.” It is possible the Ukraine’s collapse comes comparatively quickly, but the collapse of the West and the GAE will take much longer. In fact, both have been in a slow-motion implosion for around 60 years, and although the pace is increasing, it could take another four decades to bottom out. You’re talking about a civilization that has been around for close to three millennia. Virulent though the Hebro-Negro-Pomo triad may be, it cannot topple a colossus built by Greeks, Romans, Christians, Germans and Brits overnight.

            I’m not so sure. Things seem to happen much faster these days thanks to the internet and social media. Hysteria builds up exponentially and is quickly globalised. There’s also the war factor. Nothing destroys civilisations faster and more completely than war, and the US neocons seem intent of dragging us into at the very least several regional conflicts. America losing these – and they would – will hasten any collapse.

                Wildfire hysteria is indeed something relatively new, and it could be a destabilizing factor. However, warfare is endemic to the human condition and as often works to buttress an establishment as to destroy it. I don’t think we can count on neocon bloodthirst to topple the GAE.

        In many places in the USA, the public school system has de facto collapsed. Sure, kids and teachers still show up, there are basketball games, etc. but when those teachers cannot discipline the kids and those kids leave school without even knowing how to read, to me that indicates a collapse. A collapse in the whole reason for kids going to school, i.e. to learn stuff.
What vigorous Saxon and Visigoth kingdoms hath arisen to replace this collapsed, decadent late-Roman behemoth? Homeschooling and increasingly affordable (often church-provided) private education.

            There wasn’t a basketball game this past weekend in my hometown.  Why?  Because on social media a kid from my town made some kind of disparaging remark about a player from the other school who happens to be of Indian extraction (feather, not dot).  So the game was cancelled.The respective AD’s issued statements about how they’d reached out to each other and agreed that such things are unacceptable and that players from the offending school will be subject to reeducation camp – during school hours – by a third party.  The offended party says that it treasures its indigenous students and will, “promote diversity, equity and inclusion and we are committed to improvements that will benefit generations to come.”  At this point these teachers and administrators are little more than Chatty Cathys, repeating the same phrases without having to exercise their brains in the least.

            I see no evidence whatsoever that Russia is looking for an “off ramp” of any sort. A limited war in the Ukraine is absolutely in the best interests of Russia. It is affordable, both in financial cost and in terms of lives expended. It is driving a wedge between the US and Europe, stressing NATO to the core, and dividing the US body politic internally. Also, the rot of America’s position in the war has driven the BRICs countries together, strengthening the position of Russia and China.
Russia has every reason to keep this war going as long as possible.

        In the U.S. many large cities are certainly vulnerable.   If the EBT cards get shut off in about one week you will have Mogadishu.   Will that be societal collapse?   Maybe and maybe not.

            As long as the regime lives, the EBT cards will keep working. They will never, ever turn them off voluntarily. Doesn’t matter how bad inflation gets or how worthless the currency is. If each EBT card has to get $10 trillion a month, so be it.

                    It is certainly in the interest of Big Ag (and small ag) to keep on producing what they produce. Barring nuclear war or something, I can’t imagine why they would stop.
I can envision a day when imported foods become harder to find, but for AINO to have a scarcity of basic foodstuffs seems very farfetched.

                        Jeffrey Zoar:  The availability and cost of certain products is easily manipulated.  Cost of eggs (something I would consider a staple – cheap protein and widely used in baking) went sky high in 2021/2022 and then dropped back down to more traditional prices in mid- 2023.Now the cost of eggs is again skyrocketing.  In each case it’s been due to supposed ‘bird flu’ caused by wild birds, and millions of domestic chickens have been killed to prevent the spread.  I’m not a scientist and really don’t know what is real in this case, but the ‘cure’ has resulted in less supply and higher costs for a domestic staple.Easy enough toreplicate in quite a few different situations domestically.

                        Toilet paper.  Think toilet paper.There never was an interruption in the production of toilet paper during the past scamdemic.  Indeed, the factories began to run 24×7.  Yet there was a shortage (as in you could not find any) and rationing via empty shelves and store limits.  Same with several other items I could mention.It doesn’t take production or delivery interruptions, only panic.  Once word spreads of a “coming” shortage, people will buy everything available and “stock up”.Back in the bad old days of the USSR it was said that people seeing a queue form in front a State store would also line up for hours and buy whatever they had available (even with limits imposed and no desire to consume it).  If for nothing else to trade with others.

                It might not ever happen, but in “regular” countries it happens on occasion where the government thinks that they’ll never run out of money (ability to issue debt), and then one day they wake up and find out that they certainly can.  The EBT card is one thing, but imagine being on a Navy ship halfway around the world that can no longer buy fuel.

            The animals eat each other now.  Just look at the knee-grow murder rates.  Personally, I wish they would crank it up a bit, but hey, I’ll take it when I can get it.In my ideal world, all of the leftist whites who say they support “diversity” should be forced to live amongst the animals and not be permitted to leave.What I think will really happen is that AINO will continue to muddle along moving further and further left.  There will be just enough crumbs from the table to keep whitey in line.  One would think that at some point the dam breaks, but I’m not holding my breath.  There is only one way out of this mess, and that would require the ultimate sacrifice.  Once that line is crossed, there is no going back.  This is why it most likely will never happen. Whitey isn’t only sacrificing his own life, but that of his family as well.

        Collapse is a funny word, often used but ill defined. Means different things to different people, most of them wrong, as people usually are. Sorry I don’t have a date for you when things “break down.” But I do see the waning of competence, it’s hard to miss. Things seem to work just a little worse every year. More rejects making it through quality control. You see it too. In the current news cycle, university presidents whose qualification for a bachelor’s degree is questionable. I could go on, but it seems obvious to me, and probably to you too, that an Idiocracy style collapse is ongoing. Which can take a long, long, long, long time. It’s a long way down before we become Burundi. And I doubt we ever get there.I would differentiate between collapse and “shock.” The latter leads to a temporary situation of instability (because all instability is temporary), and while it’s possible for this to happen, you could go broke trying to predict when, where, or how. Or else spend the rest of your days out there in your bunker when the shock was still another 40 years off.Would the average German have been well served to establish himself a survivalist compound in the countryside along about 1912? Or would he have been better off expatriating? You could ask the same question of the average Russian about the same time frame. You may be able to flee political repression or instability, but I’m not so sure there’s any escaping the Idiocracy. Most of your options involve fleeing to somewhere that’s already farther down the Idiocracy scale. “Are these the people I want to be around when everything stops working?” isn’t a bad question to ask.

            America runs on credit. What happens when we can no longer borrow money to plant the crops or fill the warehouses? Businesses do not use their own money for production anymore. Better to buy back stocks and give bonuses. Our whole system is dependent on cheap money. Cheap money is inherently dishonest and can only be done with a fiat currency. Not sure what happens when the credit dries up.

                I had read last month that the first battalion of Ukrainian soldiers had been sent to the front: on the Russian side, recruited from POWs. You may remember one of the early Ukrainian atrocities was firing missiles at a POW camp in Donbass (filled with THEIR OWN PEOPLE) who had been captured at Mariupol. The only reason to do that was that some of their Ukronazis were getting a clue about for whom they were actually fighting, and Kiev wanted to dissuade that tendency.Their is zero chance this doesn’t end with Ukrainian kill teams exterminating every single Vanguard/Blackrock/Rothschild operative and their indigenous Ukrainian collaborators. The Russians do not have to convince Ukrainians to love Russia, just to hate those who started the war and want to rape Ukraine to death for fun and profit.

        “liberal democracies have shown an ability to self-correct”That’s silly. Liberal democracies are great at hiding collapses. For ex. when Nixon ended convertibility of the USD to gold, it was the final act of the collapse of the old system. Only on the surface has the system continued after the collapse.An even better and more ominous example is the demographic change happening in the West. For example, if you slowly replace the French with Arabs and Sub-Saharan Africans, then France has collapsed, even if the state keeps going semi-functionally, under the same name, with the same form of government etc. Same with the USA: Once the country looks and works more like Brazil than what some old people remember as the US, then it has already completely collapsed, even if it is nominally still a liberal democratic country.

            People have watched or read too much post apocalyptic fiction and can really only conceptualize the post collapse as something akin to Mad Max.For many, the collapse has already happened.  We have armies of drug addicts and homeless people whose daily existence is a post apocalyptic horror film of trying to survive and procure the next fix. 20-40 year olds’ deaths are just a daily occurrence. A very large chunk of these people are the sons and daughters of the previous middle and working class.My guess is the continued collapsing of the US will mean the growth of this population.  AFAIK, this also happened in Russia. Alcoholism, drug addiction and suicide skyrocketed in Russia post Soviet collapse.  I believe this was also pretty common in Germany after WW1. Berlin became the “sex tourism capital of the world”

                This is a great point. Frodi recently posted a conversation with Sam Dickson where Dickson effectively points out what you do. Collapse is in the past tense: TFR; addiction; suicides; crime; established racial caste system; cultural rot (ubiquitous thug culture; sportsball; Disney/Hollywood); Eurpid/Occident erasure … …It has collapsed. However, something has already filled the vacuum because it was organized and orchestrated to do so on the domestic front. What they don’t control is how the international order will go.America and Britain are gone. Scotland, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy still have a chance to preserve their homelands but the hour is late and mutiny organized with the indigenous populace is the likely only path to salvation.Our task is to cleverly navigate constructing our own thing inside of the domestic nightmare they are constructing. We can do it, but we have to be clever how we navigate no freedom of association. We also have weapons that can be a source of funds for our cause – their tool to dispossess us can also be used to make them pay for systemic anti-white discrimination, exclusion and dispossession.

                    France is worse than the US or the UK.Scotland is in Britain and is as woke as California.
What facts do you base your opinions on ?For example ; France is more diverse than any Western country other than the US or Canada. France currently is carrying out a nation wide counter-insurgency effort in FRANCE-not Afghanistan or Iraq.

            You’re getting close to something important with this post, and that is cultural collapse. The culture of AINO, and perhaps the West in general, has already collapsed. It is so much lower now in terms of sophistication and pulchritude than it was just 40 years ago, that it’s not even funny. Is culture a leading indicator? I think it probably is.

                The now-cliche “politics are downstream of culture” does raise the question of what is upstream. I suspect nothing. What is upstream is what replaces the existing culture, which is what supplants the polity and all else. I don’t think the elimination is as complete as Sam Dickson would have it, but he’s more right than he is wrong. There is much scurrying now to extinguish any flickers of the once dominant culture.

                Yes, because everything is downstream of culture. Everything. Even the economy: look at how many big corporations are willing to court bankruptcy in order to follow the Woke/ESG agenda. As the culture goes, so the civilisation goes.

                        That is an interesting consideration. Not only do they lack the ability but there is no desire to imagine anything to the contrary of abundance. The average for human society has been scarcity. We live in the rare era of abundance.

        For a contemporary example of Ukrainian recovery, I would expect they will follow Germany’s footsteps after WW2. Although not exactly the same, there are quite a few similarities. However their greatest challenge to recovery will not be the loss of territory or actual the rebuilding, it will be the effects of massive corruption. And not just internally, but corruption propagated by the West.Germany post WW2* –• German industrial output was reduced by 30%.• Housing stock was reduced by 20%.• Food production was half the level it was before the start of the war.• A large percentage of German males between 18 and 35 had been either killed or crippled.• The currency (Reichsmark) became practically worthless.• The country was split in half.Economic effects of the war on Ukraine can be found here –https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/assessment-damages-ukraines-productive-capacity*https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/german-economic-miracle.asp

            And yet Germany, at least in the West, rebuilt itself into the dominant power in continental Europe within a generation.  This was possible because of the German people and who they are, what their culture is.  I do not see a similar outcome for Ukraine.

                    Much of that happened primarily after the Cold War, 3g. The rebuilding Karl pointed out happened and was encouraged, and while it is counter-intuitive the racial degradation intensified only after the USSR no longer was seen as a problem. Things are now as you point out but much of it only manifested post-1991. A cousin by marriage who came of age in the old communist east says the country as a whole now is much more anti-German than even then (the East German government claimed all the Nazis had moved to West Germany, for example). I also don’t think the United States would have bombed the North Stream II prior to the current age. Karl didn’t mention that but it surely represents a new low in the treatment of Germany.

                        “Karl didn’t mention that but it surely represents a new low in the treatment of Germany.”Yes indeed. Scholzy was there at a presser where Biden said it would be “taken care of”.Is there a more cucked creature at this moment crawling over mother Earth than this German “leader”?And is anyone in Germany raising a stink over his cuckoldry?Germans are not the people they were. So many I have met over the course of my life seem either almost childlike or super spergy. Obsessing over trivial things and doing their best to avoid looking at reality.This has been a great loss to the West.

                        Despite any sort of rebuilding program, Ukraine will never be anything more than it was before the conflict, just smaller and poorer.But let’s not kid ourselves. Germany, like most of Europe, has been in a steady decline since the 1980’s.Back then problems were starting to appear with declining exports, fewer technological advances, higher labor costs, a lack of skilled workers and increased investment abroad rather than at home. Although we managed to work through that, we have failed to innovate and now China is eating our lunch.Culturally, we are terrified of being in debt, which has resulted in a massive lack the entrepreneurial spirit or private investment here in Germany. Which is why Microsoft, Google, eBay, and so many other massive software companies could never have started here. Even with a strong electronics base with companies like Phillips and Siemens, the history of failure in the German semiconductor industry is legendary.Because we sat on our big fat laurels for so many years, and failed to invest and innovate  the Chinese are now building and selling machine tools and cars. And now VAG and Mercedes are trying to figure out how to keep selling cars to the Chinese. In fact you can buy the same VW EV for less in China than you can here in Germany.The Greens have been pushing for EV’s, but the average EV in Germany costs 50k-Euro. And now that the German government just killed the rebate scheme, there is even less incentive to buy them which just kicked VW in guts.And now the Chinese are leaving German brands for their own brands which are, quite honestly, technically superior.  This is really not good for Germany where 46% of our industrial market depends on auto sales.BERLIN, Dec 16 (Reuters) – Germany’s electrical vehicle subsidy programme will end prematurely on Monday after paying out some 10 billion euros since 2016, the Economics Ministry said, the latest sign of belt-tightening following the adoption of a revised 2024 budget this week.https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/germany-end-e-vehicle-subsidy-programme-2023-12-16/

        The difference between the GAE and the old USSR, as Juri pointed out below, is that Russian society in the sense of the people did not collapse although its Regime did. That’s a very good point. The Russian people endured and outlasted the State because the communist system ultimately depended on the people failing.The problem we face is far more destructive to us as a people: demographics in fact are destiny. We already see dissolution and fragmentation as a result of the influx of aliens. Whether this was planned or a byproduct is hard to say, but the foundation is rotten as a direct result. The Russian core did not break apart although it suffered mightily. Our core is breaking apart even now. The division among Heritage Americans is irreconcilable and the opposition to the colonizers is a permanent feature now.There are similarities between the systems, of course, and that includes economies based on war, imperialism and projection of power rather than production of consumer products. The USSR promoted this arrangement because of ideology, the GAE does because of greed (and arguably to a lesser extent ideology). The USSR economy, while far weaker, also shared problems of unsustainable expenditures just as the GAE does today but as previously noted its economy was too fragile to limp along as we see with the infinitely wealthier GAE. The old USSR also had concerns about demographics but were in a far superior position to the GAE on that score.I don’t think the loss in Ukraine will be as impactful as you do. Maybe it does cause the elite to share the same cynicism as the larger populace but that is the case now to some extent. Europe could show more independence but has been extraordinarily submissive in the recent past. The Neocons might be weakened but it is hard to see them eliminated until the American State no longer endures.The upcoming year promises to be full of political upheaval that will aggravate the demographic and civil fractures mentioned previously and will accelerate fragmentation. The date collapse occurs is a parlor game, and individuals and groups need not to waste too much time on it and plan for survival and what comes next. It should be noted that empires do tend to collapse swiftly even if it is a fool’s errand to predict precise dates. Rome was an outlier, and the Austro-Hungarian and Soviet empires were more representative of what historically happens.

            Compared to what Russians have historically endured–Mongol conquest, Ivan the Terrible and his Oprichnina, the Smutnoe Vremia, etc.–Soviet misrule was just another rut in the road. When the people are hardy, homogenous and unified, they can overcome just about anything. In terms of these qualities, “Americans” simply cannot compare, and for that reason, AINO is far more susceptible to genuine collapse.

            HI Jack
The TFR in the west is a huge force multiplier. The continental United States will be a completely different animal in 30 to 50 years. Not sure the replacement population will be able to maintain the system for very long. The nation may resemble Africa with varying degrees of competence depending on the tribe controlling the land.

        This is a great question. I admit that I’m as susceptible to “collapse porn” as anyone. There’s plenty of evidence for collapse, to be sure: the debt is $34 trillion, Judge Ketanji from Uganda is on the SCOTUS, Trump is under arrest, two gays just got caught doing anal in the Senate, the public schools are trying to turn your kind into a tranny.It simply doesn’t make sense that the county can possibly continue to go on under these circumstances. But in contrast to times past, we’re not sending an army into Virginia to kill Confederates, we’re not conscripting two million men to kill Germans in the trenches of France, and the Air Force isn’t accidentally dropping nuclear bombs into tobacco fields in North Carolina. The President may be senile and a naked bribe-taker, but at least he’s not a four-term wheelchair-bound cripple who is pals with Stalin.Caesar crossed the Rubicon in 49 B.C., but Rome didn’t “collapse” until 476, when they moved the capital to Constantinople. Arguably that was not even a collapse but an administrative move; the true collapse of what was left of Rome didn’t occur until 1453 when the Ottomans overran Constantinople.That’s the thing about history, for every “collapse” there is a new rebirth of something. The collapse and rebirth is always bad for some people… but good for others. It always depends on who is writing the history and controlling the narrative, I guess.I would argue that the biggest collapse in Modern times occurred in 1918, when the Russian, German, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman empires collapsed, and the British Empire was weakened to the point where it would only survive 30 more years. It was the collapse of the feudal, monarchical order, and it opened the door for the GAE to start controlling the world in 1945.How much life the GAE has left is something I cannot predict, but I can say that Western elites are pretty unified and Western dissidents are not in a position to take control and make substantive changes anywhere.

Yes. Whatever happens to the GAE is more likely to resemble those.

        I find myself thinking a lot about collapse these days.  Been reading about 2nd and 3rd Rome and their long collapse.Like the Romans – and unlike most of the former Warsaw Pact countries – we are now “diversified” to the point where the original population has stopped caring.Maybe we are in a long collapse, but with the exception of the Romans, that’s not how empires usually go out.  Every time I see we borrow-printed another trillion dollars or passed another law making commerce more difficult, I wonder if that’s the straw breaks us.  Maybe not, but I’m now in the habit of buying an extra can or bag of dried food with an expiration date years in the future every time I grocery shop.  Hopefully, I take it all to a food bank in a few years.

            Covid should have collapsed the economy and the civilization along with it, but it didn’t. We should be having bear markets and bull markets at semi-regular intervals, but we aren’t. Inflation should be causing consumers to cut spending, but restaurants are still full, shops are still full, and people are still buying cars and houses. I see no difference in the landscape between, say 2017 and now.The only conclusion I can come up with is there is still a lot of smart people running things, and they probably have solutions that we may not even be aware of. White nationalists like to say whites are going extinct, but there are still more high IQ white people alive today than ever in history. Dissidents like to think we’re in anIdiocracy, too, simply because there are more dumb people than ever before. And they’re celebrated by the media. The Earth is nearing the height of human population which will peak at somewhere around 10 million before falling precipitously sometime in the next century.There is a lot of good human capital still out there, and for the foreseeable future. On the Roman timeline, I see us at the Gracchi period rather than the early 5th century.So I don’t think a collapse is imminent, and still could be reversed, God willing. The collapse happens when there is a serious lack of good human capital. Which will start in about 100 years, unless our clown world course is reversed, and we can set up systems which will manage things while most of the human population is African.

                The Boomers and perhaps Generation “X” are the last cohorts to avoid the reverse Flynn effect.  The follow on generations are declining in IQ—and that leads into a decline in our educational institutions which amplifies this genetic incompetence.That is only talking about Whites.  We have also been taking in non-Whites by the millions and their IQ was always lower than the Native American stock.  (For example, it looks like the Biden administration has allowed at least a 2-3% population increase *just* with IA’s crossing the border—and they are not the “best and brightest” as Trump astutely pointed out!)   So what you are talking about is the Smart Fraction and how large that needs to be to keep this shitshow running as we’ve come to experience it.I agree we won’t see catastrophic collapse ala Germany after WWII, or Russia in the 90’s, but it seems to me that the signs of “collapse” are everywhere for those able to see and understand such decline.  It’s like playing a film of a major accident in slow motion.  But it’s there and it’s real.  AI might slow the film done a bit more, the brighter might escape temporarily into secluded areas, we might buy some time by depending upon  other countries for technological innovation/support less affected than us (Japan, Korea, China), but the decline is baked into the cake.People live in the environment/society that they make for themselves.  Those with poorer intellect, produce a poorer environment/society as fits their ability.

                It might be easy to think the economy is fake or that society is on its last legs if you live in the shell of a Rust Belt city or in the middle of a coastal urban hellscape, but where I live the economy is humming along better than ever. Mining, energy extraction, and especially agriculture are all efficient and prosperous. We even have manufacturing too, although the factories are heavily automated so relatively few highly-trained employees, unlike the oodles of good middle class jobs that ended with the Boomers.I think it is easy for those of us who are terminally online to miss the impact of technological advancement on otherwise boring industries, and it is now quite possible for fewer numbers of smart people to do even more with even less. We are all familiar with how the innovations of fracking and horizontal drilling revolutionized the domestic energy industry and converted the USA from a (heavy) importer of oil to (briefly) a net exporter in only around a decade’s time, not to mention the near-infinite amount of natural gas we can access whenever we want (and of course if we were ever serious about getting infinite free electricity produced by a small number of smart people, we could just start building nuclear plants again.)AI is another huge force-multiplier that is quietly transforming industries and building wealth. “Uncle A” chatbots might be fun, but the most visible applications are hardly the most useful. Models can be applied to geological data to assist the mining/energy industries, planters can use AI to increase crop yields, etc.tldr; there is A LOT of wealth that is constantly being generated – more than enough to keep things going even with all of the corruption and incompetency of Clown World. We all know normies will keep the system going for as long as they have their panem et circenses.

                    Kind of to back of your point, that’s what the Covid Lockdowns showed: large portions of modern economies don’t even matter.  It’s like there could be some Elon Musk-style Twitter purge through the whole economy and not much would change.  So, the parts thatdomatter, are doing well, while the parts that don’t (which is most parts) maybe not so much?  That would be my theory anyhow.

                    … and it is now quite possible for fewer numbers of smart people to do even more with even less. ”I do not argue the above, but also note that the smart fraction produces the “very smart fraction”.  Dutton talks about this in his book, “The Genius Famine”.  AI has yet to prove it can extend into the genius part of the Bell Curve.  I bet it will not and if it did, then we’d really have AI becoming self aware. Problematic in its own.I just can’t help thinking of way back when computers were coming into their own and certain software applications packages were developed to use such power—SPSS, Mathematica, etc.  I was in the university computer center teaching use of such packages and even installing them on the mainframes we had.Part of my job was to consult faculty in the use of these programs and to debug faculty and student programs that failed.  What became apparent was that failed programs often were the result of simply not understanding the mathematics behind the applications/analysis being attempted with these programs.  Garbage in, garbage out as we say.The packages provided high power analyses with relative ease, but really were not a substitute for knowledge of the math behind the problem attempted to be solved.I grew up in a time where all these analyses had to be done by hand before I was allowed to use a computer.  Mastery first, efficiency later.  No exceptions.  Few today know how to do factor analysis with a protractor and multiply matrices by hand.  I do (or did).Is AI a false “Superman”.  Will AI make a weak mind stronger, or just more efficient at dull jobs.  Does the strong mind become stronger, or just more dangerous?  We shall see.

                You are too optimistic.That good human capital you speak of is indeed there. But the entire system is hell bent on sidelining it. Most of it being white males.What’s left is fat low IQ whites and non-whites being the cannon fodder for the military and for the corporations and that means incompetence and poor results all around.Mix that with systemic corruption.One disturbing example: the Rooskies have various hyper-sonic missiles. Even the Chinese apparently have some. Meanwhile the MIC keeps developing the American ones. For years. Yet they are never delivered.Everything just sort of goes … sideways.So you are half-right: what we will get most likely is a slow-motion collapse.And it’s OK. Until push comes to shove. Like they decide to openly put uniformed NATO or American troops somewhere like Galicia and they decide to teach the Russians “a lesson”.Believe it or not, much of the world has already figured out that the US military is over the hill. Much like the vaunted IDF that excels at murdering kids and women but going toe to toe with Hamas fighters, not so much.

        We will know that our sphere is on the right path when we stop fixating on collapse and start fixating on creative thought and action.

            Can’t we fixate on both? It’s important to read the signs of collapse all around us (and they are there) in order to avoid being under the rubble when it does blow. It’s also important to plan solutions. The two aren’t mutually exclusive; in fact, you need both angles to survive what is coming.

        &gt;  For example, Blackrock has been buying up land rights in Ukraine, expecting a Ukraine victory.
While the MIC sees all gains in dealing with Ukraine, the Blackrock investments are a little baffling at first glance. While ideologues, they aren’t dumb and must be hedging their bets in some way. What is probably happening is these “investments” are incapable of being liquidated and Blackrock will simply request the money printer to go brrrr if Ukraine goes belly-up.
It goes back to the idea that in modern times, a corporation’s gains are private and their losses public.

        Soviet Union did not had society collapse. Actually other way around. After 70 years of destruction, our societies remained so strong that finally anti society regime collapsed itself. All struggle in the Soviet Union was between society and regime. Collapsed society can never over throw regime. People can not unite when society collapses and that what communist regime wanted.

                        True. But the GAE’s economy is far more free market than command. The Leftist program that runs the GAE is postmodern, not Marxist, although there are superficial cultural similarities.

            That’s an excellent point. The difference between the GAE and the old USSR is that the society in the former already has collapsed but the Regime remains intact and power hungry.

                Depends on what you mean by “societies”. Cities, yeah, I doubt there’s anything left there. The anti-society forces have mostly won there already. Maybe a shared hardship would renew the social ties, but I doubt it. There’s simply no common factor under which people can ally. So if you are urban or suburban, I understand your pessimism.
But as another of my favorite bloggers says, in Modern Mayberry, it’s a little different. Give it a shot sometime. But leave the cockroaches and other pests in the cities where they belong, please.

            Blackrock is a black box, so we cannot know for sure. A safe bet is they have feelers into Russia, as a hedge. On the other hand, history is littered with example of smart people making catastrophic errors. What is the expression? Some thing are so stupid that only smart people can do them.

            So much of the derivatives market is dark, but I’d be astonished to find out that to a large degree, all their investments are not hedged with credit default swaps. And now with precedents set by the Chicago Mercantile and MF Global, it’s perfectly legal to rehypothecate customer assets, forcing them to assume the risks, and even outright steal customer segregated funds to make the principals whole, so long as you are a loyal contributor to  the DNC.

            If “ideology takes a second seat” at Blackrock, then why are they one of the primary proponents of ESG?The answer is because, even for those who control Blackrock, hatred of traditional whites is more important than profit.Not to pick on David, but there is an inability among many on the right to imagine that there are groups for whom a cause is more important than profit.  (It’s similar to how white people can’t imagine that there are racial groups that are not full of good will towards the other peoples of the world, like how whites are.)If you can’t even conceive that there are groups of people more committed to their tribe or ideology than to profit, then you are partially blind to reality.

                    Quite possibly, but on the way, he will say things that whites aren’t allowed to be say. But once those ideas are out there, whites will be allowed to say them, which will wake up even more whites.

                Agree that he’s not on our side, but I think that he can be useful.Cobra is a good sign. He’s a sign that different power bases are forming. He used the usual suspects’ playbook to get money and into the system, but I suspect that he doesn’t want to be their lackey like his co-ethnic Haley.The rise of Indians within the US and Asians and, to some degree, Arabs outside the US is good for us. They’re breaking the usual suspects’ lock on power. Granted, it’s not as though we’re moving up, but competing elites is good for us.Cobra is out for Cobra. The idea that he has some great love for whites is crazy, but to gain power, he’ll say things that whites aren’t allowed to say and wake up a lot of whites. Sure, he’s just using them, but once they’ve woken up, they’ll head to our side.

                    Citizen:  I think you are overly optimistic about Whites waking up, and Whites being allowed to take their own side (verbally as well as socially).  And I don’t agree that non-Whites stating forbidden truths is to our benefit.  See Thomas Sowell, Larry Elder, etc.  Either way, I have no personal interest in or impact on electoral politics.

                        You could be right. I mean, whites who haven’t woken up yet probably aren’t going to wake. It’s not as though they haven’t seen how much non-whites and the usual suspects hate them.
I also agree that electoral politics isn’t going to anything for us. I honestly don’t follow politics at all. If Z hadn’t write about it, I wouldn’t even have known what Cobra said or that Cobra even existed.
