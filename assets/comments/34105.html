        There is plenty of blame to go around. The Church usurped the warrior caste when it moved against the Knights Templar and destroyed those orders. Some posit that that remnant may have gone into the new secret societies and the Masons ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ and enacted their revenge during the French Revolution. If not explicitly at least in a spiritual, karmic retribution.In any case, generalizations are difficult. Some of the most organized, high agency and best prepared Americans ready for post-America are low church protestants. Some are Catholics.I think the key is not denominational but caste. What is beyond the shadow of the doubt is that the merchant caste won the Enlightenment and found its full expression and liberation in America. That is the problem.You cannot let traders run your society for their business is selling this and measuring success by how much and for how much profit they can sell. I am not anti-business. I am saying that the Merchant caste is not civilizational. In fact, its fundamental impulse is anti-civilizational ‚Äì distributed costs and concentrated benefits. That is the antithesis of civic virtue by definition.We need to put the religious squabbles aside. We need ethnic/racial solidarity and we need to find a way to get the merchants on side but ultimately bring them to heel. That may be impossible. It may be that their power and force of will will first bring us all to ruin. Then we will enter a pirate age of civilizational collapse. Those with strong tribes and tribal alliances will do okay. From there, perhaps the strongest men will have a civilizational impulse and assert their will and be met with enough people who have had it with the dead end of living as a commodity in an office park / shopping mall.

            The Templars CREATED international banking and the checking systems.  The world is financially enslaved by their progeny still today.
The Templars rightly were hounded out of most of Europe, but the satanic scum re-grouped in Portugal and elsewhere.  Should have been exterminated when the opportunity presented.  Now they are Blackrock.

                Okay. So, Larry Fink‚Äôs ancient ancestors were Germanic and Gallic Knights Templars? And what about the popes of Avignon with their multiple football field sized beds?
As I said there is plenty of blame to go around. These arguments over barely understood accounts and interpretations are silly.
What we do know is that being led by the merchant caste is dissolving us.
Btw, Souter died. This is a big moment for Trump. He can find a 35 year old Heritage American who is ready.

            The Templars had absolutely nothing to do with the Freemasons, and the caste-usurpation going on was multdimensional. The warrior Templars had broken into banking, the province of the merchants, and while running it both more effectively and morally, run afoul of the king who owed then great sums. The king then, through his own usurpation of the priest caste via the Avignon papacy, who owed HIM money, used the church to destroy the Templars.There is also evidence that Freemasonry, while deeply heretical and subversive in its own way, was infiltrated and weaponized by yet more subversive heretics in the late Enlightenment. There‚Äôs an infamous letter written to George Washington to this effect.

                Right on. Sounds like you are far better versed in the nuances of Phillip and this important moment in Our civilization than me. References to that letter to Washington please. Also good reading materials on this topic are appreciated.

                    Here‚Äôs the letter, which is of course apocryphal but interesting and fairly plausible nonetheless.https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/06-02-02-0435Ihaven‚Äôt spent tons of time on Freemasonry but as best I can tell its origins lie pretty straightforwardly in some of the more secretive/esoteric guild practices from about the 14-1500s that grew into a boys club for affluent, edgy nerds with some gnostic influences, and then basically Kabbalah for goys. It did end up being a vehicle for some rather bad people and things much like other shadowy clubs for rich subversives today, but its power peaked in the 1800s. The purported Templar and ancient Solomonic connections are just we wuzzery, some from within, some from without, largely derived from false accusations of occult practices among the Templars that some actual Masonic ones resemble. At least they‚Äôre ahead of the Rosicrucians, who were literally memed into existence fully formed by one guy who wrote a book, ‚Äúbuild it and they will come‚Äù style.

                Who said there would be no merchants? Don‚Äôt be so dramatic. You sound like a post 1950s American University student. Hitler or Not Hitler! Merchants or No Merchants! Total Freedom or Tyranny!
Think with some nuance for God‚Äôs sake. You must have a healthy merchant caste. But, they cannot be in charge. That is the issue. If they are at the head of the table, there is no head at the table.
They deserve and hold an important place, but they cannot be the caste that is the arbiter of civilizational matters.

                    And now you are revisiting an issue that was resolved by the Indians 4,000 years ago.
They had the priestly caste, the Brahmins, at the top.
Then the warrior caste, the kshatriyas next.
Followed by the merchant caste, the vaishyas third in line.
Finally the menials or the Sudras at the bottom of the hierarchy.
Then Brits went into India and tried to impose Christianity and equality for all men.

            Right there is the heart of the matter. It turns up all over, not just in the context of religion. People from Massachusetts move to New Hampshire and immediately start telling the locals how to be a Granite Stater. The normie gets mugged and within hours he is lecturing me about what it means to be a dissident.This assumption that you can not only question authority, but you can declare yourself the authority starts in the protestant revolts. After all, who in the Hell was John Calvin to think he knew more than a thousand years of Catholic tradition and theology? He was Job questioning God, but unlike Job, he learned nothing from it. Many have followed that example and here we are in a civilizational crisis.

A more basic hypothesis: Religious reform always leads to falling apart.

                                I‚Äôm hardly taking Fauci‚Äôs side, but my guess is he would say that his policies stemmed from another side of the scientific tradition in opposition to the ‚Äúnatural immunity‚Äù side. In other words, it is not difficult to find an authority to justify one‚Äôs acts and therefore claim orthodoxy. What‚Äôs more, he would doubtless cite his exalted title in support of the position that not only was he part of medical orthodoxy but that, in AINO, he was the supreme medical authority.

                            What do you mean ‚ÄúAnglosphere ‚ÄòChurch bad, ban Bible‚Äô?‚Äù Wycliffe was burned at the stake for translating the Bible into English. Aside from rejection of papal authority, common Biblical literacy was one of the foundations of the English Reformation, although the same schools who teach that MLK was a saint, Hitler was evil incarnate, and that the war against the Indians was unjust and one-sided also say the English reformation was because Henry VIII was horny.

                                You‚Äôve got a few things conflated here. Wycliffe wasn‚Äôt executed, he died of a stroke (while saying mass, no less); decades later he was judged a heretic and his works and remains destroyed, as part of a much broader condemnation of doctrines he and other Lollards adhered to. Tyndale was indeed strangled and burned on the continent (having fled England after running afoul of the Protestant Henry) more than a century later, but again not merely for the act of translating into the vernacular, but the quality of the work and bias that accompanied a great many other major points of contention. There had been authorized vernacular translations going all the way back to when Latin WAS the vernacular; enough linguistic drift had occurred in the centuries since the last English version to necessitate another, but the Douay-Rheims was finished by the end of the same century, largely contemporary with the King James, and both of them incorporated those men‚Äôs work to different extents. The notion that Rome was moving heaven and earth so that nobody could read the Bible except in Latin is a sop, and one that, in typical schizoid fashion, schools that reduce the roots of the English Reformation to ‚ÄúHenry Horny‚Äù also maintain at the same time. That‚Äôs both secular public and private Protestant ones, in my personal experience as of a couple decades ago.

                                        A myth, yes, but I must point out that literacy is subject to something of a semantic fluke in this context. Plenty of people could read and write functionally in their own languages, though still far fewer than today, but being literate was largely defined as being fluent in Latin and Greek, the common languages of academic discourse, theology, science, and law.

                    Good analogy.  It seems to this ‚ÄúCatholic‚Äù that there was a valid point in Martin Luther‚Äôs rebellion and the reformation he began.  I wonder how we, this group, can not all admit that there is more than a bit of Martin Luther‚Äôs spirit in all of us‚Äîand it has little to do with Christian orthodoxy.

                            I appeal to the skepticism we as a comment group usually apply to most statements of authority from the powers that be.  Catholicism is not excluded in that reference.
If such hurts your sensibility regarding faith, then I‚Äôd say your faith was not so strong as you imagine.  Deal with it.

                            You mean the Church Fathers who said things likeThey said that he who adhered to faith alone was cursed; but he, Paul shows that he who adhered to faith alone is blessed-St. John Chrysostom (Homily on Galatians 3)Upon this rock. He did not say upon Peter for it is not upon the man, but upon his own faith that the Church is built. And what is this faith? ‚ÄòYou are the Christ, the son of the living God.‚Äô-St. John Chrysostom (In Pentecosten)Certainly the other Apostles also were what Peter was, endued with an equal fellowship both of honor and power.-St. Cyprian (On the Unity of the Church)This prologue I write as a preface to the books to be translated by us from the Hebrew into Latin, that we may know that all the books which are not of this number are apoocryphal; therefore Wisdom, which is commonly ascribed to Solomon as its author, and the book of Jesus the son of Sirach, Judith, Tobit, and the Shepherd are not in the canon.-St. Jerome (Prologue to the Books of the Kings)For petra is not derived from Peter, but Peter from petra; just as Christ is not called so from the Christian, but the Christian from Christ. For on this very account the Lord said, ‚ÄòOn this rock will I build my Church,‚Äô because Peter had said, ‚ÄòThou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.‚Äô-St. Augustine, Tractate CXXIVThere‚Äôs plenty more where those came from. One of the reasons a lot of Reformers countered contemporary Catholic dogma was because it was indirect contradictionto much of what the Church fathers wrote, even in matters that there was a patristic consensus on.

To your larger point, it‚Äôs surprising how little most of the RC folk know about their own religion.  But that‚Äôs sort of the point of it.

                            I can see Catholics getting into a bit of a snit over the first few Theses, as they deal with confession. After all, one of the most beloved of Bible Stories is when Jesus took over a two-seat outhouse, put a piece of lattice between them, and listened to His disciples‚Äô confessions.
But, jeez, most of it is about selling indulgences. That‚Äôs corruption, plain and simple.

                                ‚ÄúMost‚Äù is rather generous, but yes, the sale of indulgences was indeed a corrupt practice, especially with Tetzel et al. additionally grossly misleading the laity as to what indulgences even were and did. Rome had been taking steps to curb this sort of grifting since at least the early 1200s, and were on the same page as Luther, at least up until his argument against indulgences as a concept. The trouble with Luther is not to be found in those theses of his which dealt with administrative failures and abuses. The reforms introduced with Trent are clear evidence that they were all seriously considered, and many of them accepted.

                                    It‚Äôs fair to say at least 30-91 were strictly about indulgences. I‚Äôd expand that to 8-91, on the basis that 8-29 concern purgatory, which the indulgence is alleged to ameliorate, 5-7 deal with the Pope and clergy‚Äôs ability to forgive sin, or if forgiveness is only something God can grant.
By my reckoning, at least 86 of the 95 are about indulgences or the hierarchy‚Äôs authority to use them to affect God‚Äôs judgement or mercy in any way.

                This assumption that you can not only question authority, but you can declare yourself the authority starts in the protestant revolts. After all, who in the Hell was John Calvin to think he knew more than a thousand years of Catholic tradition and theology?

                Just to piggy back on your comment (which apparently I was one of the few people who liked it) there‚Äôs a guy on the dissident social media sites who notes that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs always someone in charge‚Äù and that putting multiple people in charge was a detriment to the western church.  For example, Protestants will bellyache about the Pope but then also complain about how some confab over the ‚Äú8th Order of the Baptists of East Kansas‚Äù exhibits the same or worse issues.  Just another case of killing tradition and getting nothing in return.

                        Scofield‚Äôs work was funded by Rabbis.

The errors of Rome begat the Reformation, as well as Vatican 2. The ‚ÄúFilioque‚Äù heresy, doctrine of Original Sin and the universal jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome over the entire church are but a few.

                No, you have this wrong. ‚ÄòA thousand years of Catholic tradition and theology‚Äô was just more men adding their opinions and organizational structures onto the words of Christ and the acts of the prophets and apostles.
Like how some ‚ÄòJews‚Äô replaced the Torah with that mumbo-jumbo Talmud that rabbis cooked up in Babylon.
Protestantism is getting back to basics. The fact that the denominations became corrupted is just human nature operating in a fallen ‚Äî and cursed ‚Äî world.

                    Protestantism is many things from Unitarianism to Anglo-Papist Anglicans.  There are so many variations among and within denominations that the only thing they have in common is that each man determines what is right in accordance with whatever version or compilation of Scripture he individually approves of.  There is variance in which, if any, Church Fathers or Councils are accepted (only some Protestants even know the meanings of those terms) In other words, it is a world that accepts no authority or tradition except what passes muster with the current generation.  Luther tossed out the authority of the current pope and also questioned the authority of the Epistle of James, because it seemed  deficient  in his eyes.  Our contemporaries also through out what offends them.  If the Apostolic and Ante-Nicene Fathers have no authority, what chance does Calvin‚Äôs Institutes of Christian Religion have?

                        IfallProtestantism is just Jim and his Bible under a tree, why did Luther condemn anabaptists? Why do Anglicans, Lutherans, and even Presbyterians have ecclesiastical structures (yes, Lutherans and Presbyterians, even if you don‚Äôt call them bishops they‚Äôre still bishops) and ecumenical synods? Also, don‚Äôt quote Church Fathers at Protestants when St. Basil, St. Chrosostom, and evenSt. Augustineall made it clear that ‚Äúthe rock‚Äù of the Church is the confession and that argument for Petrine succession is bunk. I guess you guys still have the Donation of Constantine to settle all doubt. Oh, wait.

                            Sorry I was unclear. As state elsewhere above there are at least 40,000 different species of Protestants and they continue to splinter/mutate/evolve into new bodies.   There is a vast difference among Protestants‚Äì I was part of a Protestant church that had everything from the Tridentine Mass in English to the Prayer Book Communion Service in Latin to some stripped down communion service with guitars and whole wheat bread and boxed wine with a mostly dignified, beautiful and Scripture and tradition laden   liturgy in between.The theology was even broader than the liturgical spectrum Catholic, Evangelical, Charismatic, Liberal, traditional and barely Christian  modernists.What those Episcopalians at least acknowledged was that the Church was a continuum from Pentecost on and not somehow misplaced for more than a millennium before being rediscovered in the 1500s in Europe or the 1800s in upstate New York.I don‚Äôt blame Baptists for not knowing about the early centuries of the Church; they have been robbed of their patrimony and don‚Äôt know they even possessed it at one time.  (Henry Tudor and Cromwell can take a chunk of the blame)   How do they think they even inherited the Bible?  It wasn‚Äôt a Baptist or Puritan that collected it and passed it on.  Thank the Catholic and Orthodox Church

                    Protestantism is no more ‚Äúgetting back to basics‚Äù than the sort of Muh Constitution appeals that in turns ignore Fed, Anti-Fed, and other contemporary works and philosophy from the selfsame authors as a lens for interpretation, and treat as sacrosanct, immutable, original, and exclusive the particular shape of something which underwent a lengthy process of creation and modification before taking that shape. Both involve treating Step 3 as both Step 1 and Step 10, or walls as both foundation and capstone. Our Lord left us with a living hierarchy and intact Tradition, which He did not abolish any more than He did the Law. The error of the Pharisees was in their legalism and perverse interpretations and applications of the material with whose care and cultivation they were entrusted, not the material itself. Attempting to ‚Äòrestore‚Äô a (largely ahistorical conception of a) Church whose existence predates the compilation of Scripture, through Scripture, while disputing the authority and doctrines of those who authored and compiled it, is a fool‚Äôs errand.

                            Yes, because that isn‚Äôt even remotely how that works. Doctrine, belief, becomes dogma at a glacial pace and is only added to, never altered, replaced or removed. Procedure and policy have always been much more adaptable and changed at a more rapid pace, as temporal existence necessitates, but that is not theology.

                                    No, though the Supreme Court is very much a bastardized secular copy of the Magisterium. Think of dogmas as constitutional amendments; like amendments, they cannot be undone, but unlike them they cannot be overwritten by subsequent amendments, and they are handled internally with the pope ultimately codifying (ratifying) them, the last instance of which was in 1950. Canon Law (decisions/case law/interpretation) is subject to alteration, but the Deposit of Faith cannot be subtracted from.

You aren‚Äôt seriously claiming a ‚Äúright‚Äù to rewrite the inspired Word, and that is just as valid as the Gospels, are you? That‚Äôs what the USSC does.
FWIW, I don‚Äôt ascribe a lot of authority to the NT anyway. He had the opportunity to review the Law and the Prophets, and didn‚Äôt make any corrections that I‚Äôm aware of, yet He had no chance to do the same with the NT. The authority of the NT is a matter of faith.

When Jesus talks to the rich man, the point is not that wealth is inherently sinful, or you would have to concede that the Vatican itself is rooted in sin, but rather that for that particular man, wealth was the god that man had placed above God.

                People from Massachusetts move to New Hampshire and immediately start telling the locals how to be a Granite Stater.Is not how the Protestants viewed their situation? My knowledge of this is limited but I was always under the impression this was the same exact logic at play justifying their divergence.Removing the specifics of this, just in general it‚Äôs seemingly impossible to get disparate groups of people to agree on anything long term without conflict ensuing. With that in mind it seems inevitable that divergence of faith would take place, its practically a natural law at this point that humans divide into different groups.I don‚Äôt know of a single group of people who ever enjoyed being told how to live by people who are not of their tribe. Such an arrangement is a surefire way to cultivate resentment which is the precursor to rebellion. Unless one has the means &amp; the will to subjugate an unwilling population they‚Äôll go their own way. This happens all the time with decaying empires, I don‚Äôt see any reason for religion to be immune to this phenomena &amp; as history has shown, it isn‚Äôt.From my view its a miracle it held together as long as it did, if it wasn‚Äôt the Protestants it would‚Äôve been someone else given enough time. This seems to be a symptom of the endless cycle of civilizations rising, peaking, decaying &amp; collapsing, it certainly fits in with the pattern.

                    Except Christianity in the US has never been based on Catholicism. Catholics were the outliers. Only one of the 56 signatories of the Declaration of Independence was Catholic. Only two of 39 the signatories of the Constitution were Catholic, one of whom also signed the Declaration. I find it grating that Nick Fuentes types insist that Americans must return to a tradition we never had and never wanted. It‚Äôs right up there with slapping ‚ÄúJudeo‚Äù in front of Christian and claiming that‚Äôs the intellectual tradition of the West. And before people say the lack of Catholicism was the reason America fell into filth, I seem to remember a very Catholic France devolving into mob rule with a similarly Catholic Spain enjoying the fruits of revolution for almost a decade while Americans were still God-fearing and decent people.

In recent times the several Orthodox national churches have differed not just from Rome, but from each other. So the answer to your question is: In the end, they aren‚Äôt different from the Protestants. Consider how the Orthodox in recent years, like Protestants, in the last century have come to accept contraception as not a sin.

                One has to specifically define ‚Äúcontraception‚Äù, as in technique.  The spectrum varies, hence a rational argument can be made for acceptance under Church doctrine.

                Orthodoxy is at least still considerably more theologically reliable than most of Protestantism, though somewhat less so with time. Also somewhat more historically reliable, though considerably less so with time.

            Jesus wouldn‚Äôt have recognised either Catholicism or Protestantism. He was born, lived and died a Jew and had no intention of starting a new religion. He was rather trying to purge Judaism of its hypocrisy and legalism and bring it back to its pure roots before the forthcoming end of the world.

            the catholic church is the Original church , set up by the apostles . they first chirch . the eastern church was basically a branch of the catholic church . They split off in 1054 ad. the only real diffrence is the ortodox do not recognize the primacy of rome and the pope. this is very very diffrent from the protestants. the catholic and orthodox have lifte the condemnations of each other . losing the christian faith is the main diffrence between the early 1960‚Äôs when i was a child and the present day .the catholic church is also the only reason europe and by extention north america are not muslim.

                They really hate this answer, because it is the historical truth. Amazing to see such womanly behavior in response to these questions. Downvote, downvote, downvote. It‚Äôs pathetic. This is the only way the DR is going to approach the JQ, however ‚Äî by attacking Catholicism.
Nothing has changed in the US since the 1870s when Catholics began arriving in large numbers. Christmas was illegal in most New England states until the late 19th century thanks to the Congregational Church. I don‚Äôt suppose anyone here wants to return to that state of affairs, however.

        ‚ÄúWhen the universal authority of the Church was challenged‚Ä¶‚ÄùEvery great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business, and eventually degenerates into a racket.And now they‚Äôve given us a new Peruvian pope who holds dual citizenship in the US.  The business of the church is in shambles, in large part due to collapsing collection box revenues from US Catholics.  The obsequious groveling to the State during Covid did a lot of damage.My favorite thing about the pope selection process was all the Catholics telling us the way to save the church and the West was to install a black pope from Nigeria.Proving that we are well into the racket phase.

                And vice versa, @Luther. My knowledge of Catholicism is limited to 1 year of Comparative Christianity back in the ‚Äô80s, so I don‚Äôt comment on most religions very often. And almost all the Catholics I‚Äôve met are decent folk, apart from some have a weird inferiority complex regarding their kid brothers.
Usually I only pipe up when Pride tips over into Hubris. Or when we are talking about head choppers. Not even Judaism. My favorite Savior and all His friends were jews‚Ä¶

        One of the sayings that Z Man is known for is, ‚ÄúSays who?‚Äù with respect to any claim of moral authority.  For example, ‚ÄúSays who that we must have massive immigration?‚Äù
Luther and Z Man both ask that same question, although Z Man may not wish for that association.

                    You aren‚Äôt off the mark down-comment but I‚Äôm not sure you understand what dogma is. Selling indulgences certainly was never dogma, nor even doctrine, but was then, is now, and had always been in complete violation of church teaching, as was the subsequent embezzlement of the revenue by the pardoners selling them. Had Tetzel not died very shortly after Luther published his theses, some very bad things would have happened to him.

        Having gone over to the demographic POV, it makes sense to me. Orthodox (Eastern, Greek, Russian, etc.), ROMAN Catholic (Latin), Protestant (Germanic). East and two West.
Ancient fault lines, affinities, dynamics. The Church didn‚Äôt solve them.
And Calvin isn‚Äôt the only source of Protestant theology, of course. French name, isn‚Äôt it? Not sure if he was French or French-speaking Swiss. Anyway.

            Yes and no.Protestantism-as-Germanic-folkspirit, while not an unpopular or entirely boneheaded take, is a pretty gross oversimplification in my view considering how divergent the main schools of thought within it are. Some manifestations do seem to be cultural, at least as far as Calvinist and Arminian derivstives (Presbyterianism, Puritanism, Anabaptism) flourishing amongst the very mercantile Swiss, Scots, Dutch and Anglos. And in England‚Äôs case, the geopolitical rift with Spain FOLLOWED religious schism as well as personal insult to royalty where previously they had been quite close. Lutheranism gained traction more as a consequence of political machinations of the day, capitalizing on princes of the HRE‚Äôs secular spats with each other, with the emperor, and the empire‚Äôs with Rome, which became something of a self-fueling cycle. That said, even after more than a century of conflict, Catholicism was only partially displaced in Germany and Switzerland, and hardly at all in Austria. Though I suppose there might be an argument with the Nordic countries.I would posit the schism with the East was also much more narrowly geopolitical than demographic, at least at the outset. The persistence of certain very old Latin rites in odd places, that of ones that are neither Roman nor Greek but in union with Rome, and the existence of Eastern Catholicism as an entity belies a lot of theorizing on both sides as far as it being just an inherently Eastern thing.

                As far as Protestantism being Germanic, I look at where it originated and which nations adopted it. Seems plain to me.
Holy Roman Empire was German, fair enough some Germans would stay Catholic for its sake.

            I mean, it‚Äôs the whole idea of universals and bringing people together in them. The Church faltered, people lost faith, became modern, attempted it along secular lines. That project has failed, too.Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I believe in universals, but to be honest, I‚Äôm not sure there are many of them‚Äî maybe not enough to bind the nations together permanently.Everybody wants to get big, it seems, but it also seems there are limits to how big they can get. Yet, if there‚Äôs some worldy force driving history, it looks to me like it‚Äôs that inexhaustible ambition. Tower of Babel. People never learn, even those who should know better.

                Also yes and no. Despite insistence and predication on sole central legitimate authority, Rome is pretty big-tent in practice. There‚Äôs a slew of different acculturated rites and liturgical uses that are considered licit. The East was always given broad license, and those that remained still are, but the Orthodox wanted more. While schisms may present or begin as a matter of decentralizing administration, they become a matter of decentralizing belief, if that is not already lurking under the surface.

                I really dislike this theological discourse, but I think a lot of the true disdain held toward the Catholic faith is, if you rigerously adhere to the catochism ( beliefs of the Church) they‚Äôre simply too demanding for modern society. How many intend to stay married for life and under the assumption you will have children? How may denominations condemn homosexualtity as disordered? No slavish devotion to Isreal and jews in general. Requirement to attend mass weekly, etc.Modern man just lacks this discipline.

        Religious tradition is part of culture, which is downstream of genomics. Even among (1) the tapestry of ethnicities who make up the European race, there is too much difference for any universal system to endure without constant external threat reinforcing cohesion.Different ethnonational peoples have different preferences for how to organize themselves socially, politically, and economically. Compound this with a natural human tendency for social differentiation (2) and it is amazing that European civilization under the Catholic Church held together long enough for the Scientific and Industrial Revolutions to enable us to defend ourselves against the encroaching genocide of islam.So, there is a tension between needing something ‚Äòuniversal-enough‚Äô to bind our race together in collective self-defence against jewish and islamic predation, but not so universal that it serves as a vehicle for said enemies to import more enemies into our realms. Too little is death and too much is death. Of course it would be much easier if the enemy weren‚Äôt already not just over the walls and into the city, but into the primary control node of the manufacture and distribution of currency.It might seem strange, but I found it especially hopefully that the Irish tricolor was hoisted side by side with the Union Jack in recent demonstrations. When the reality of our impending collective destruction manifests, our internal differences can be set aside. Oh, and Keir Starmer is a wanker.############(1)actually, ESPECIALLY among b/c we European actually have internal genetic diversity b/c we aren‚Äôt cousin f*ckers like pretty much all non-whites (including all varieties of jews), as evidenced by variation in measurements of genomic heterozygosity(2) ex‚Äôs: female hypergamy, male sportsball -&gt; goes back to the Red, Blues, Greens, and Yellows in the old chariot races in the Roman Empire -&gt; some of these ‚Äòenthusiasts‚Äô killed each other over a completely synthetic association

It‚Äôs irrelevant to everyone except fans of ancient literature, atheist nerds who think they can ‚Äúrefute‚Äù it‚Äî imagine a refutation of Shakespeare‚Äôs sonnets*‚Äîand collectors ofgotchas.Christianity used to be other things‚Äîa religion based on the Bible, even‚Äîbut we don‚Äôt live in other times. Christianity iswhat Christians do. Christianity is worshipping Jews, being gay, importing dusky hordes to rape the girls of losertown, and money-grubbing like [aspiring rappers]. The more ‚Äúright-wing‚Äù the Christian, the more smug and weaselly he is about desiring those things.The Bible of course recommends none of this. It‚Äôs a much better thing than Christianity is. (That‚Äôs the closest I‚Äôve ever come to saying something Protestant.)*Actual existingChristianity is morethatthan a religion based on Biblical text. The sonnets are capital-E Ecclesiasticalsermons, #94 especially, which reads like the founding text of a great and true religion (like Ecclesiastes does). No living person has ever heard a Christian talk like that.

        ‚ÄúThis assumption that you can not only question authority, but you can declare yourself the authority starts in the protestant revolts.‚Äù ‚Äì Z-ManThat started when the Bishop of Rome unilaterally declared himself the Vicar of Christ, and in the same moment, he created atheism. That is not the only thing it did. One of the others was the then inevitable Protestant Reformation. The chain of logic for atheism is not even hard if you try, but you will not try. The chain of logic for the Reformation requires history you do not have.One of Christ‚Äôs teachings to the disciples gives you a hint about this ‚Äúpope‚Äù business, but you will not find that either, even though the Gospels are short and there is some nifty red highlighting in most versions to make it easy.Z-Man is badly out of his depth on this one, but enjoy your newpope. Here is the end of the article he promoted:‚ÄúRight now, many American Catholics do support, and even cheer on, attitudes toward immigrants that show little sign of having been transformed or challenged by the Gospel. Rather than continuing to try to justify ourselves, we need to hear Jesus asking us ‚ÄúWho was neighbor to the immigrant on the border? To the immigrant in your cities? To the immigrant in detention or being deported?‚ÄùThe Gospel does not offer a charter for how to legislate about immigration. It does offer a standard for how far we are to go to love our neighbor, and a refusal to accept the limits we might be comfortable with on who our neighbors are. The question we need to answer is whether we judge our politics according to the Gospel or the other way around.‚ÄùOne of the sublinked articles even goes further. Pope Francis was going to make my job easy one day. Robert Prevost now Leo XIV might make it even easier.

            Running low on Catholics in these United States, why not import millions. It‚Äôs a good business decision, and the Church of Rome has always placed good business as its highest priority. This country used to be, for good reason, anti-Catholic. Split loyalties are a hell of a thing.

                    You are correct. There has been little to no influx of Spanish Catholics into the US church, and the small blip that occurred decades ago was only due to their status as new arrivals. Only the hierarchy of the Catholic church still insists upon the future of the church being Spanish. It hasn‚Äôt happened and won‚Äôt.

            Seems articles all tout the first ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù Pope, yet he spent a veritable lifetime in Peru and holds dual citizenship‚Äînot even counting Vatican City. Now where do we have a prior example? Yep, the previous Pope, an Italian from Argentina. For years, as long as I cared to follow such‚Äîothers here can correct me‚Äîwe‚Äôve had tension between the Latin American Catholic Church and the North American. Repeated stories about activist Bishops and such more concerned with social justice than the Gospels.

            The Bibles insist that your thoughts and emotions are in the beating muscle in your chest, or have their material correlates there. (Plato agreed, as far as I can tell from my reading of Grube‚Äôs translation of Republic.) Our scientists refuted that bad biology long ago. Other scientists of ours refuted the ascension stories. Our philologists exposed the misuse of Isaiah 7:14 for promoting the doctrine of virginal conception. Trinitolatry is error on stilts, like the material from which it was formed.No one needs to know any Hebrew, Aramaic, or Greek to recognize some of the most egregious mistakes of ≈†emitic supremacy and the populist derivative to which you adhere. Correct reactions include rejecting the na√Øve theism of trinitolatry (which isnotin Israel‚Äôs Bibles) and then learning how to read Bibles as one would read strategy and planning docs captured from an attacker.

                Have it your way.Current theoretical physics postulates that our universe exists in 10 dimensions (11 if you want to include time).And you, you nose picking, meat eating, mouth breathing tool using super ape? You perceive less than 10% of the first three dimensions. Of those you understand less than 5%. And you‚Äôll purport to sit there as my moral and intellectual superior?üòÇüëçAll that, with NO idea of what lies beyond boundaries of our universe, or what time is, or the state of affairs before the Big Bang? And tell me conclusively there is no room for God in any of that?The Bible is not a scientific tome, or a suicide pact or any other lesser document. It is a treatise on the nature of God and the human soul. It is no coincidence that the people pulling the roof down on western civilization are almost exclusively atheists.

                I am out of my depth L.I started with the Common English version of the Bible to get started in studying the basics. There are theological scholars that will split hairs, pick the fly chit out of the pepper and count the number of angels dancing on the head of a pin trying to promote their preferred version and their sect and chosen denomination‚Ä¶ but I am not one of them. For me the versions are remarkably consistent ‚Äì it‚Äôs the interpretation that varies. If you‚Äôll permit me the pun ‚Äì the devil is in the details. Currently I am ‚Äì rightly or wrongly ‚Äì in the King James Version.All the versions over the centuries are incredibly consistent too. The KJV as well as other versions coincide almost exactly with the content of the Dead Sea Scrolls.The collapse of the denominations is remarkably consistent too. Those that are dying almost exclusively and blatantly reject various sections of the Bible. My personal theory is that a new reformation is in the works and I believe we are seeing it today. The biblical sects are slowly unifying and expanding under the radar ‚Äì just as Christianity has done throughout history when confronted with adversarial and oppressive govts.The faith has survived and defied jews, Phillistines, barbarians, Romans, moslems, fascists, communists, and any number of others for 2000 years. I personally don‚Äôt think it will fall to today‚Äôs queers, pedos and shitty liberal women. It‚Äôll just go underground and wait them out as they always have‚Ä¶But whadda I know?

                    You could do a whole lot worse than KJV, @Filthie. There are obvious limitations of language ‚Äî for example, it translates both ‚Äúekklesia‚Äù and ‚Äúkuriakon‚Äù into ‚Äúchurch‚Äù because, despite the fact these were sufficiently different that the Greeks distinguished between them, there wasn‚Äôt a good English word to convey that distinction.
IMO, the best argument for KJV is that pretty much all educated people of the day wrote and spoke Greek, so the Septuagint is almost certainly an accurate rendering of the scrolls He taught from.

                        As a Catholic I will agree that you can do a whole lot worse than the King James. Comparing and contrasting that translation with its contemporary the Douay-Rheims is a worthwhile exercise regardless of alignment, with the NRSV being a decent more recent version to triangulate with both.

        Protestantism moves Christians away from the ritualism and man-sourced authorities of Catholicism (Pope and priest) back to the Scriptural words of Christ and the prophets (whose literature, btw, was extant LONG before the ‚ÄòFirst Century‚Äô, e.g., Isaiah and Job).Human beings are evolving, learning creatures individually and collectively. The concept of one God ‚Äî and that God a Father ‚Äî moved the world away from belief in, and reliance upon, the sex-‚Äòn-violence fertility cults of the ancient world and associated Great Mother or goddess worship.These latter underwent revival in America in the 19th Century (spiritualism) and mid-20th Century (Sixties paganism and following New Age). Both these movement were woman-dominated and, like occultism, concerned with manifesting the ‚Äòdivine feminine‚Äô.Post-Prot, relationship and communication with God in his aspect as Father or Son no longer required any intermediary but was accomplished directly on approach of the Son. This changes relationship to God from one of distant believer mediated by ritual and priesthood, to one of immediate experience as a son or daughter of God.Protestantism comes into disrepute because of people like Huckabee who trivialize and personalize a God they do not comprehend, and don‚Äôt really love. The likes of us do not babble before the LORD and His direct interventions in this world are rare.Humanity must move away from reliance on the maternal (mother-cults, goddess-cults, paganism and occultism) and toward the paternal (Father and Christ the King). Christianity stopped at absorbing the maternal, making Christ‚Äôs birth-mother the Queen of Heaven and Co-Redemptrix with Christ . . . same way they built churches over sites of pagan cults and locales of natural power.Current Christianity is kept alive more by monks than by the churches, which largely and inevitably became enslaved to the culture. The real Church is scattered physically but unified as living members of the Body of Christ. Don‚Äôt need no smartphones with that bunch.

            Consider for a moment how accurate and honest most reporting tends to be about literally any given thing, and then apply that to the majority of coverage of the last pope. The man was certainly not without his flaws, tended to favor the soft approach on most issues, and was more conciliatory towards certain groups than would probably be prudent. But if you actually read his statements in their entirety and commentary from internal sources, almost nothing said about him by anybody else holds up, whether that be secular rags masquerading as Catholic ones in service of sowing deceit and demoralization, or confirmation bias addled ‚Äòtraditionalists‚Äô who have long used a few valid concerns as a vehicle and excuse for all sorts of other thinly veiled nuttery. This is especially true when it comes to alleged acceptance or promotion of any kind of sexual degeneracy, malicious distortions or complete fabrications one after another. Just last year the man was heard not-so-privately lamenting the amount of faggotry (not notionally but using the literal Italian equivalent term) in the church twice in the same week!

                And the NYT publishes retractions, eventually, on the back page and nobody puts much stock in them. Why are they buried in the details? Because nobody read them. Same reason all of the ‚Äúbased‚Äù crap Francis said went unread by anybody who wasn‚Äôt a conservative Catholic desperately trying to carry water for him. I give you credit for being a Catholic who‚Äôs intellectually honest to recognize that by RC doctrine ‚Äúno pope, no church.‚Äù If Francis‚Äô outlandish statements weren‚Äôt meant to be used as soundbites to bolster the World Council of Churches agenda the RC seems hellbent on pushing alongside most mainline Protestant denominations, I‚Äôm pretty sure he would have stopped giving them ammunition after the first half dozen times his proclamations raised a few eyebrows. The ‚Äúclarifications‚Äù the Vatican always offered up always struck me as more of a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt spook the horses‚Äù affair.As for his personal quotes about there being too many ‚ÄúBritish cigarettes‚Äù in the Vatican, 1 is too many. Also, if a man loudly yells that vanilla is his favorite flavor of ice cream and then whispers that it‚Äôs chocolate, it doesn‚Äôt prove anything other than the fact that he‚Äôs a liar. If his moral convictions were more in line with conservatives, why wouldn‚Äôt he proclaim so loudly? He‚Äôs the pope. It‚Äôs not like he has a boss down here to rein him in. He fired at least one bishop who tried to do so.

                    Forget retractions, most people don‚Äôt even read articles, just the headlines, which often directly contradict what‚Äôs within, assuming the whole thing isn‚Äôt completely made up. They publish whatever they like, about whatever and whomever they like, regardless of what they do or don‚Äôt say or do. Putting the onus then on the pope to be unimpeachable or inactive and holding him accountable for lies and libel isn‚Äôt any more realistic than expecting the same of anyone else.And contra your analogy, the man wasn‚Äôt saying one thing loudly and another quietly any more than any other leader using harsher language outside an official setting. He repeatedly and unambiguously condemned transgenderism as one of the greatest evils of our age, decried the destruction of the traditional family unit, and reviled abortion. Though he expressed the opinion that legal proscription might not necessarily be productive or just in all cases, he unequivocally stated homosexuality is a grave sin, a far more stringent stance than many Protestant churches are willing to espouse. ‚ÄúPope Soft On Gays‚Äù read the headlines; libs cheer, trads seethe. He laid out guidelines for the baptism of repentant deviants (which in Catholicism involves a lengthy process of instruction, review, and deliberation, you can‚Äôt just show up) and told one that God loves people as they are (which is true, no need to mutilate or poison yourself, in fact He wants you to stop). ‚ÄúPope Cool With Troons‚Äù. Wash, rinse, repeat. If you wish to presume inherent bad faith on his part, that‚Äôs your prerogative, but I cannot.

            The funniest ones are the ones who say ‚Äúthere have been bad popes before‚Äù and that they‚Äôre loyal to the church itself and that it will prevail. When St. Athanasius was excommunicated by a bad pope, it looked in no way certain that the Church would prevail.Also, we‚Äôre in the first era of ‚Äúbad popes‚Äù where saying that doesn‚Äôt get you thrown in prison awaiting your trial for heresy. After all, it‚Äôs in Papal Bull Unam Sanctam ‚Äúwe declare, we proclaim, we define that it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman Pontiff.‚Äù At least the Sede crowd says ‚Äúyeah, that guy ain‚Äôt the real Pope.‚Äù It‚Äôs a lot more intellectually defensible than saying ‚Äúthe guy that is the head of our church, is the personal representative of Christ on Earth, and those outside of his approval are outside of the church ‚Äì he‚Äôs a bad guy and we should just keep doing what we think is right without him.‚Äù Both are basically Protestantism in denial. If your system is capable of putting a heretic in charge of you while demanding your absolute adherence to him, your system is not worth preserving.

        As a Greek, I was waiting for your take on the Orthodox Church‚Äôs place in all this, but it never came. I have to ask, why do you see the Protestant reformation as such an important event in the return of peganism, but not the schism? I actually agree, but I‚Äôm curious to hear your answer.I‚Äôll stir up some crap with you Catholics too, but just remember that we‚Äôre all brothers here. How do you guys square the circle of papal infallibility? These are fallible men that have been provably influenced by politics. Pope Leo XIII had a vision of Satan infiltrating the church within 100 years, so even he didn‚Äôt think the church was infallible. There‚Äôs now been a pope that was luke warm on the gays, and one that likely helped hide a child molester priest. Both were totally on board with globalism to the point of supporting mass migration of Muslims into Christian countries.  If you were hoping for one of the more conservative cardinals, you don‚Äôt believe in papal infallibility in your heart either. I‚Äôd also like to remind you that the Orthodox Church has been the most consistently conservative on all these issues. Results matter.

            Infallibility applies narrowly to dogma and was last invoked in 1950. Kirill and Elpidophoros are on record saying things at least as superficially outlandish as Francis with regards to racism, ecumenism, Islam, etc., but personally I give them the same benefit of the doubt I granted him. Y‚Äôall have got many of the same issues as we have, they just don‚Äôt receive the same spotlight or enhancement from the usual suspects for a number of reasons.

            Whereas a Latin which has been mostly static for a couple thousand years, and changes only when necessary to support some new Papal Bull..?
AssumingNietzsche wrote that, my opinion of him has dropped even further. Surely he has to have known that there still exist all kinds of plays and literature in the original Greek, so we can infer what those concepts meant to the original speakers of that language.

        Religious organizations splinter for two major reasons‚Ä¶either they don‚Äôt work well for the people driving the economy and economic growth, or major corruption casts doubt on the sincerity of their spiritual claims‚Ä¶The medieval Catholic church had major problems with respect to both issues‚Ä¶ and where they were very wealthy, like the monasteries in England, they also attract the greed of the rulers‚Ä¶The Church of England was no exception, with the entrepreneurial class largely becoming ‚Äúnon-conformists‚Äù..Notoriously, the massive canal building in the 17th century was performed mostly by non-conformists‚Ä¶.

        The real problem with Christianity today is that very, very few people (in the Occident) are actually sincere believers.  Even the people who go to church just want to hold on to Christianity for its own sake.   They use the trappings of Christianity, but the message is empty, so they change it to their real belief system, progressivism.  This is why it is always progressivism and not other weird stuff.  Like you‚Äôre never going to walk in to a White Christian church and find people worshiping snakes or something.People will not suffer anything in promotion of a fake religion (one they do not believe).  This is why nobody is willing to make sacrifices.This is true across every denomination of Christianity, at least in the West.  We saw this just this week in my own denomination with the new woke Pope.  He was chosen for political reasons having nothing to do with the faith.  We see the same thing with evangelicals.  They get to make up their own version of Christianity.  It‚Äôs very easy to follow the rules when you‚Äôre the one making them.

        Just for the record, I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs possible that the church that emerged from the Vatican2 event is the same as the Catholic church.  There are plenty of websites to show how the documents of vatican2 (note, not the ‚Äúspirit‚Äù of Vatican 2) contain previous condemned teachings like te Jews have their own covenant, religious liberty is the right of every man and freedom of religion is a civil right, and that the church of Christ is not solely identified with the Catholic Church.also, Paul 6 changed every sacrament and then big one is the consecration rite for making bishops which is certainly invalid. Ratzinger was only a priest, bergoglio wasn‚Äôt even a priest and this new guy is no different. He‚Äôs not a bishop he is not a pope

        It‚Äôs shocking how strong the stench of faggotry is these days amongst the main Protestant churches. The Canadian Anglican newsletter is positively giddy about their latest lesbian vicar, the Lutherans are lionizing some African twink who wants governments to accord special privileges to LGBTQ+2 ‚Äúrefugees,‚Äù and the local United church has a giant rainbow flag draped above the main doors, displacing the Cross.

            Is it faggotry, T? Or pedophilia?long ago when I was a kid we used to understand that faggotry and pedophilia were opposite sides of the same coin. But nowadays we seem to break them apart and pretend that they are two different things.People seem to forget that the church has gone off the rails before. I know that here in Alberta the big denominations were all going for a major shit back in the 80s. In my neighborhood it was the Baptists.Around here a lot of small, Bible based churches are springing up everywhere. And ‚Äì the kids are slowly trickling in. They want solid, meaningful families and not the atomized failures of their Boomer parents and grandparents.Also interesting is that these small non-denominationals are starting to reach out to each other and organize. We have organized home-school support networks, our own free summer camps for kids, periodic meetings and social functions for our elderly‚Ä¶ and it curiously seems to fly under the radar.Our church has actually evolved to take on the Usual Suspects bringing on this age of paganism and collapse too. If a faggot, feminist or cultural warrior appears in our midst, they are almost instantly isolated and politely ostracized. Without an adoring audience to virtue signal to‚Ä¶ they just lose interest and leave of their own accord.The church is not the faith in the same way that the map is not the terrain.

        Count me among those who think today was just Z having a laugh.  Yes it is reasonable to see the current mess as a return to paganism.  Animism would also work.  The simpler term would just be degeneracy.But bringing the RC/Prot thing into it is just silly.  For starters Catholicism has long been a folk religion. Examples abound but one favorite of mine is the Cavalcade of Our Ladies.  Guadeloupe, Fatima, Lourdes,  Knock, Laus, The Miraculous Medal, La Salette, Hope of Pontmain, Beauraing, Banneax‚Ä¶.And blaming the Prots for the collapse of the Catholic Consensus is like blaming the Huns, Goths and Vandals for the fall of Rome.  Catholicism by its corruption had lost what the Chinese would call its authority to grant the Mandate of Heaven well before the Prots attempted reform.  The secular authorities then split along lines predictable based on their positions within the syndicate.

                *in Kermit voice*Well you see, most people will stop at the surface level, on the floating chocolate bar, and see nothing but a turd. But what is within this chocolate bar? Nuts. While everyone is becoming increasingly erratic and hysterical in their reactions to this candy bar, it mocks them as it is composed of what they have become: nuts. Thusly, this candy bar has possessed all who gaze upon it. It is a primordial source of evil that relies on nobody being willing to engage with it. Until we are able to hold and possibly even eat the ‚Äúturd‚Äù in the pools of our lives, we will be slaves to it.

        That which works persists. Most evolutionary adaptations are local, but some are more universal. The variety of birds reflects countless local local fitness drivers. But most mammals have bicameral vision because depth perception is a huge fitness advantage regardless of environment. Ditto for religion as a tool for propagating local wisdom. Most nuances are esoteric to local culture and social necessity, but monotheism enables focus versus the chaotic contradictions of mutli-theism. The latter being too confusing for the peons to comprehend and engender.

        AUGUSTINE: So you cannot deny the existence of an unchangeable truth that contains everything that is unchangeably true. And you cannot claim that this truth is yours or mine or anyone else‚Äôs; it is present and reveals itself in common to all who discern what is unchangeably true, like a light that is public and yet strangely hidden. But if it is present in common to all who reason and understand, who could think that it belongs exclusively to the nature of any one of them? I‚Äôm sure you remember what we discussed earlier about the bodily senses. The things that we perceive in common by the sense of the eyes and ears, such as colors and sounds that both of us see or hear, do not belong to the nature of our eyes or ears; rather, they are present in common for both of us to perceive. So you would never say that the things that you and I both perceive, each with his own mind, belong to the nature of my mind or of yours. When two people see the same thing with their eyes, you cannot say that they are seeing the eyes of one or the other of them, but some third thing at which both of them are looking.EVODIUS: That is quite obviously true.AUGUSTINE: Well then, what do you think of this truth we have been discussing for so long, in which we see so many things? Is it more excellent than our minds, or equal to them, or even inferior to them? If it were inferior, we would make judgments about it, not in accordance with it, just as we make judgments about material objects because they are below us. We often say, not just that they are a certain way, but that they ought to be that way. The same is true of our souls: we often know, not merely that they are a certain way, but that they ought to be that way. We make such judgments about material objects when we say that something is not as white as it ought to be, or not as square, and so on. But we say that a soul is less capable than it ought to be, or less gentle, or less forceful, depending on our own character. We make these judgments in accordance with the inner rules of truth, which we perceive in common; but no one makes judgments about those rules. When someone says that eternal things are better than temporal things, or that seven plus three equals ten, no one says that it ought to be so. We simply recognize that it is so; we are like explorers who rejoice in what they have discovered, not like inspectors who have to put things right.Furthermore, if this truth were equal to our minds, it too would be changeable. For our minds see the truth better at some times than at others, which shows that they are indeed changeable. But the truth makes no progress when we see it better and suffers no setback when we see it less. It remains whole and undefiled, giving the joy of its light to those who turn toward it but inflicting blindness on those who turn away. Why, we even make judgments about our own minds in accordance with that truth, while we can in no way make judgments about it. We say that a mind does not understand as much as it ought to, or that it understands just as much as it ought to. And the more a mind can be turned toward the unchangeable truth and cleave to it, the more it ought to understand.Therefore, since the truth is neither inferior nor equal to our minds, we can conclude that it is superior to them and more excellent than they are.

        Hilarious comment section today. Was this column posted on the r/Jack Chick subreddit or something? Bear in mind that without the Catholic Church‚Äôs Hays Code you would‚Äôve had the same degeneracy that was creeping into films pre-code about 40 years earlier. See German cinema in the 1920s if you‚Äôd like to experience more of that.Hollywood would‚Äôve been producing snuff films for mass audiences by the 1960s with the approval of every mainline Prot denomination in the US, and Boomers would‚Äôve grown up grabbing condoms from a fishbowl in their 2nd grade classrooms. Protestants like Prescott Bush and others were agitating for free conception and abortion from the 1930s onward. Catholics held off the wave of Weimar degeneracy while milquetoast Prots and the folks in the ACLU and Planned Parenthood were held at bay for decades. The audacity to blame the Catholic Church for anything in this country is laughable, but I can‚Äôt compete with that Oliver Cromwell oil painting in your living rooms.
