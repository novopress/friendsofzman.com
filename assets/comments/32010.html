        &gt;This line gets at the problem. “It’s easy to see why so many on the right have become enamored with Bukele. They too lack basic respect for rules and institutions. They, like him, are largely unanchored by any coherent set of ideas or philosophy.”This is the “that’s not who we are” argument for higher brow people. Here’s a little tip. If a guy has tattoos that they can only receive by raping and murdering people, and are part of a notorious gangs that has terrorized a community for decades, you probably don’t need two years to build a case and an extensive appeal process.Many in the right mistake our bloated and nonsensical bureaucracies as our core institutions, when it’s more of a parasite leeching off its historical legitimacy.

            It gets back to this misconception a lot of “conservative whites” have in the US: They think The Constitution (and by extension our justice system) is something that can be applied to all people. The Constitution was written by and meant for a very select group of European men. Its writers almost certainly knew that it would never work for people from Africa or Asia, nor Central/South America. People today on the right believe it is “Magic Paper” just like leftists believe in magic dirt.Different kinds of people require different kinds of rules. Bukele probably realizes this on some level.

                People on the right, especially people who served in the military or are Evangelical Christians seem to revere the Constitution like it was one of the biblical texts. It drives them nuts when you remind them the Constitution is just a fancy name for a law that’s hard to change.

The Con is the name of a fake law imposed by liars, idiots, and cowards, and nobody needs to change a fake law.

                John Adams stated bluntly that the Constitution would work only for a moral, Christian society….and no other…He was right..But Patrick Henry said that it wouldn’t even work for the existing white, Christian America, because it simply gave too much power to a central government…He was righter….

                Mike (and others)
I’ve said for quite a while that the Constitutional system only works for moral, intelligent people who conduct themselves in good faith.
It fails utterly when the system is taken over by Marxist sociopaths who operate in bad faith because their only goals are attaining and retaining power.

                        No. The Constitution was already a compromise among people who mostly but didn’t entirely trust each other.

                “Different kinds of people require different kinds of rules. Bukele probably realizes this on some level.”
Not on some level. He has said exactly this plain and clear, including in the United Nations General Assembly.

            No pity for the gangs. The problem with unrestricted police state power is to not end up in the wrong end of it. I have a sense globohomo is taking notes on the El Salvadoran experiment and we might not like their conclusions

            It reminds me of all conservatives. I just got a email from a 2a group that said there is a case somewhere in the Midwest about illegals being allowed to carry. The head of thisb2a group said “this is a real soul searching moment”. Meaning , he supported the “right” of illegals being able to own guns.
I wrote back asking if the illegals searched their souls about all they are stealing and all the laws they are breaking. When your enemies don’t play the game you are playing, you’d better start playing their game. And that’s just winning.

            The mainstream right/”right,” and an increasing proportion of the actual/dissident right, has no intellectual content. It’s a consumer identity, a mediated self.Don’t you want to be[insert guy you don’t know]? If he’s from Plutarch or Ayn Rand, or maybe he just kinda reminds you of those kinda guys in one small way, you’re right wing. Enjoy your purchase.Strip off the rhetoric and actual existing leftism is identification with the aggressor (the next winner), while rightism is identification with the winner (the previous aggressor).Losers care about crime. Its victims are losers by definition. Being a loser is wrong. That’s it. The rest is rationalization. The left-rationalization and the right-rationalization are condiment preferences. (Left is “no mayo.”)Libertarian rationalizations—however convoluted, always variants of reductio ad $$$—are paradoxically n-brained, considering that only white men believe them. Libertarian identification with bureaucracy—focus on policy, procedure, etc., rather than philosophy—is a fairly new thing, brought to us by the Koch brothers. “Think tank” culture isstate envy(like penis envy). Libertarian guy in the post is making a demand forlawyering, not for liberty.

            It seems likely that this poseur wears a neat suit jacket with a bowtie, like George Will…that’s the great thing about the libertarians..They have very tidy political theories, and reality never enters the picture..The fact that no libertarian society has ever existed (or could exist) makes no difference at all….

        I think the American version of this is how San Fransisco was able to entirely solve their problems of crime and homelessness and violence during the days leading up to a visit from the Chinese. Turns out, you solve problems by solving them. Not that difficult, barely an inconvenience.
All our problems are like this – immigration is solved very easily, for example. But the American ideology, which is necessarily progressive and liberal, makes it impossible.
It has to go.

            Absolutely correct. Laws are meaningless. All power comes from the barrel of a gun, and things get done when those with the guns decide to exercise power. All chaos or order flows directly from which way the gun is pointed.

                I don’t think so, Jack. That is a favourite pretty lie of the left: punishment does not deter crime. They’ll tell you with a straight face that poverty and misfortune drive crime and that capital and corporal punishment are inhumane. America has foolishly conceded that point despite the fact that they work – and work well – to deter crime. Laws need punishments for infractions and they are VERY meaningful when they are so applied.
Its even worse up here in Canada where catch and release policies make sure that violent criminals don’t spend a day in jail.

                        Every complex problem has a simple, easy to understand, wrong answer.
There has always been a baseline murder rate even before blacks moved into our cities. It’s just that blacks do not increase crime linearly, but closer to exponentially.
We used to have most of the FBI Most Wanted, but not since about Dillinger, though we still had honorable mention until about D.B. Cooper.

                    You have a point and made my point. Those laws worked when the people with the guns enforced them. Even with the laws on the books, those with the guns have decided not to enforce them and in fact will put you in their scope if you get too uppity about it. Laws are only has good as those who enforce and implement them, hence, today.

                No doubt. The significance was it showed action can be taken, regardless of efficacy, and that will happen only when there is reason larger than public welfare. The border also is an example of this.

        Bukele gave an interesting talk at CPAC not long ago, which is worthwhile to watch.  He included facts and figures, and described how, before his government took action, Soros’s NGO gangs worked along with the El Salvadoran criminal gangs and the media to wreck society and particularly people’s safety.
As if Soros, the Left, and Globalists have any “basic respect for rules and institutions.”  No one in history has been as destructive as they have.
Not that Bukele is perfect, but he’s providing a very interesting case study which the Left and Globalists very much want to discredit or hide.

            They are doing the same thing here. As soon as they took control of the NYC government under DeBlasio, they started dismantling everything that revitalized the city and kept it functional. Emptying the jails, prohibiting arrest for QoL crimes (public urination, squeegee, vandalism, public drug use, etc.), banning stop-and-frisk, abusing prosecutorial discretion, eliminate cash bail to keep criminals on the streets, you name it. Of course with all of these they had either sophistry or a “study” that their own people did that backed up what they were doing. For a few years the situation looked okay as it had the inertia of the prior regimes, but once that ran out, crime started going back up.It’s impossible to come to any other conclusion but the pre-Bukele El Salvador is the society they want for us all.

                    Case in point is mass migration. The GAE used this for decades against its imperial colonies in the Pacific, small, isolated pockets and islands where the native populations were inundated with “Americans” from nearby Asia. The template for what is underway is quite old and proven. The British did the same earlier. NGO’s are just a new form of delivery.

                        Fascinating…I had a (n ex-) girlfriend – highly intelligent and a total SmokeShow! – who spent 5 years at UN Headquarters (NYC) as a “sustainability champion.” (If her passion was showbiz I would have likewise “let it slide,” because the contentment of people I love is more important than..you know…and I honestly didn’t see the harm…)Anyway, in Sept. of 2016, she announced that she was going to work for the (US) State Department in Tuvalu, of all places.“It’s as easy as that? You work for the UN, and the State Department takes you on, “no questions asked?”“Yes – the (Obama) State Department has an “open door” policy with the UN, and I’m taking advantage.”“Huh…well…the idea of a year-long busman’s holiday in the South Seas sounds…good. But tell me – what will you be doing there…?”That was the last conversation I ever had with her. (You GoodWhites refuse to mind your own busines…the NICEST thing you can call this plan is Neo-Colonial…) The Theologian’s daughter had become completely compromised by Mind Virus –  had become, in fact, an adept, a priestess, and was dead set on spreading NewWave globo-feminisim in the underdeveloped South Pacific.Before she stormed out,of the restaurant she glibly hit me with – I kid you not! –“If you are not part ofthe solution, you are Part Of The Problem!”

                How very odd that the Leftist idea of utopia is thoroughly dystopian to the rest of us. There are two possible explanations for this. First, Leftist policy springing from Leftist ideology simply makes the world a worse place. Because Leftist ideology is divorced from reality, the policy springing therefrom is irrational and therefore pernicious. Second, the Left isn’t really utopian at all. Its utopian rhetoric is actually a stalking horse for their actual nihilistic agenda of watching the world burn. In the second case, their Satanic behavior creates the Satanic Inversion.

                And I guess they figured that not enough New Yorkers or their “new voters” would remember how Giuliani and his police administrators cleaned up New York and made it safer, compared with the previous admins.  For those here who don’t remember, those quality of life crimes which seemed to some like minor annoyances were rightly targeted, which made things better for all.  Was it a sensible sociologist, Wilson, who advocated that, and talked about the broken-window syndrome?  Soros’s people don’t worry about others’ broken windows.Obviously tolerating things like graffiti doesn’t just lead just to ugliness, but it leads to worse.  Not that ugliness isn’t a huge problem today.

                    WRT NYC, I remember Giuliani.  Even last time I was back there you could see the remnants of his law and order stance in the city subway stations.  In those initial days, there was blatant “fare skipping”.  Subway cops arrested all they caught and penned them in cages built by the main token booths.  These cages, now unused, can be seen all over.  Ah, the good old days….

        One of the great blessings that my parents instilled in me was a respect for manual labor. As a teenager, I bailed hay, worked on a shrimp boat and worked at a grocery store, both as a bagger and as a stocker.I still love fixing things around the house, chopping firewood and doing yard work. It’s good exercise and it’s fulfilling work.It made me appreciate that I could work using my brains, not my brawn more than those who never get their hands dirty. It made me a “whole man.”Our ruling class and the chattering nabobs of negativism who constitute our political “dialogue” have no experience in the real world. They don’t have to worry about the consequences of these policies they tout. Grocery prices and gas prices mean nothing to them.Diversity to them is the hip, college-educated black guy at a party.To them, working with one’s hands is icky and done by people that are beneath contempt.And as for El Salvador, I wish we could banish feral black and Central American criminals to a gulag. I also wish we didn’t have such odious scumbags like the ACLU and the SPLC standing in the way of preserving civilization by letting barbarian hordes run loose in our cities.

        This is why more and more isolated, rural communities are developing parallel governing bodies. It’s just easier to ignore Uncle Sugar, or the current state.There is a road that runs by my place, that is used rarely, and when it is, it’s mostly combines and those big honkin dump trucks that haul crops from field areas. The road is beat up every year, and every year the individuals who use/benefit from the road, resurface it with road pack and make it usable.no permitsno work crewsno closuresno EPAno “studies”Just a task that has to be done, that the individuals know how to do.it gets done.It would take years to get that short, one lane road fixed if the G were involved.

                        Well, you know, people need to do the needful. Someone I know very well tells the story of an undesirable “family” who moved into her neighborhood back in the day. The neighbors, get this, did not complain or say anything at all, but instead did a few unpleasant things that, in short order, got the undesirables to move out.
You know, sometimes you get what you frickin’ deserve, I guess. But don’t act like such things are impossible.

                            This doesn’t work with millions crossing the border. What are you even talking about? We are way past these little local solutions and there is nowhere to run.The real solution would have to be at a much higher level than a neighborhood watch and it requires a strong and determined leader. This is precisely why Bukele is so interesting and appealing, but so far there is nobody in the west wiling to rise to his level.

                    Like I mentioned above, these small local solutions don’t work. Maybe 20 years ago they did, but now, with an unlimited influx of migrants into the West, it’s easy to overwhelm a neighborhood. Now is time for much bigger solutions.

        I get the sense that Law(n) and Liberty wasn’t a typo on the Zman’s part. I was sort of following along with Lynch until he began whining about the hero Pinochet, the man who saved Chile and made it the envy of Latin America to this day. There is no reason to make apologies for this great man. His enemies were communists, and he did with them what you’re supposed to do with communists. It’s common, if you get out and about in AINO, to meet aliens from all over Latin America. I have met precisely one from Chile. That tells me something.It’s incredible what can happen when you have a leader who actually cares about his people and his country. It’s been so long that Americans have forgotten what that looks like. Or like Lynch, recoil in horror when confronted with it.

            The thought occurs to me how the ancient Romans solved their Republican governmental dilemma in the face of grave calamity—the *Dictator*.  A dictator was appointed among the people (elites) for a particular duration and purpose.  The power invested in this man was absolute—even greater than Kings, who were often constrained by competing power factions or precedent/tradition.  The great fear of course was that the dictator appointed would not return power once the crisis was addressed.  This is why Cincinnatus is remembered and praised to this day.  The relinquishing of power is always problematic.We see something similar to this in modern times.  Pinochet, Duterte have been mentioned, now Bukele.  I would also include Putin.  Point is that it seems “democracies” inevitably run into their builtin contradictions and at some point are faced with chaos or authoritarian control to survive.  Doubtful we will avoid such an ending.

                I have no hope for an AINO strongman because AINO is not one nation anymore. In all your examples, there was still a people to rally behind him. In our case, the best that a strongman can hope for, any faction’s strongman, is to have 1/3 or very best case 1/2 of the people on his side. That’s not gonna cut it. So I expect chaos more than authoritarianism, although whoever is in power will attempt, unsuccessfully, the latter.

                    The surveillance State is quite new and growing.  There never was such power at the hands of a potential dictator/strongman.  In the military, they call this a force multiplier.  When the CCP falls from power in China, we can continue this conversation.  Until then it’s a “draw”.

        Think of the lives that would be saved and the financial costs of the chaos that would be eliminated if we had someone who looked at the ” gun violence” problem in America and said yep, ban blacks from having guns. Maybe make an exception for a Clarence Thomas or have a IQ test or something for the talented 10%.The murder rate in America would over night look like Switzerland.But we cant seem to get politicians that make things safe and working properly.So we admire the guy who can down in El Salvador.

                Reminds me of a twitter exchange following the case of the black jogger in GA who was shot by shot the McMichaels in self defense. A woman posted “Is there no safe place for black people?!?” Someone responded with “Africa, large continent south of Europe, you can’t miss it.”And the response to that was: “Too dangerous, it’s full of blacks.”

            G Gordon Liddy:  Your suggestion of a “law” to fix a real-world demographic problem is just more of respecting ‘rules and institutions’ rather than reality.  Your ‘solution’ would create yet more laws and regulations and bureaucracies and solve NOTHING.  Guns are tools; blacks are the problem.  The sole solution is either spend time and treasure trying to keep them all corralled, or permanently remove them from your society.

The magic number appears to be around 3% of the populace. Below that, it’s hard to effect major social change. So how do we go about getting to that 3%? Hint: It’s not going to be by recruiting blacks or jews or lefties, and we are doing everything we can to alienate the right…

            This should be precisely the position of “compassionate conservatism” in the US. It doesn’t even need to be all blacks. Gun violence statistics show that this is not a 13/52 type of problem–it’s more like a 0.01/70 problem.This will be an unpopular statement here, but statistics show that the overwhelming majority of blacks are law-abiding, hard-working citizens. There is a tiny minority of blacks, comprised mostly of black men between the ages of 14-30, who commit horrendous levels of crime, including gun violence. Many of these young men become decent, productive members of society after age 30, if they live that long.There would be incalculable societal benefits to imposing a rigid, structured system including gun control onto this population. It would pay for itself, as crime would drop precipitously and resources currently being used to deal with crime could be redirected into what would effectively be a type of national probation/parole system for these men.The way to sell this to the left and to normies is to point out that this population of young black men between the ages of 14-30 die at ridiculously high rates as the primary victims of their own violence. Normies and the left will never buy this based on the argument that society at large will benefit. But the unassailable argument against the left is that this type of system will give these young black men the opportunity to get through those difficult years so they can blossom into the engineers, doctors, and lawyers they are all destined to become. They left would literally be killing young black men if they oppose this policy.

        Libertarians also have a massive hard on for endless immigration and outsourcing your labor, resources and capital if it allows for more profits next quarter. It leads to endless misery and churns through the population with leaving nothing behind besides number on paper or a comp screen.

            Sad but true. Hoppe at least has a sensible view of the immigration issue. Illegal immigrants are in effect trespassers. Outsourcing is largely a result of bad tax policy that favors the well-connected billionaires. Libertarians who see outsourcing as only an issue of free enterprise miss the point.

                Outsourcing is largely a result of bad tax policy.
Outsourcing is mostly quarterly thinking by CEOs. Greed and shortsightedness. If I move the production to a lower cost area I will improve profits and the stock price will go up. I win.
The idea of continuity and long term planning for industry was killed off by the financialization of the economy.
The concept that a modern complex civilization requires a middle class seems completely lost on the wealthy and political class and the brain damaged on the left.
Third world countries tend not to have a middle class.

Corporate profits can always be expensed away. They pay only as much tax as needed to keep people thinking it has some effect.
And the people running corporations are no more greedy and shortsighted than they ever have been. It’s just that it’s not until recently that those characteristics were rewarded by government policies.

            I used to practically deify Ayn Rand when I was a yonker, just starting out on the road to adulthood. I was a proud LIBERTARIAN (yes, I even said it in capital letters) until….the realities of life rose out of life’s waters and bit me squarely in the ass. I found out that people don’t WANT to leave me alone, and don’t WANT me to leave them alone to deal with their problems and that full legalization of drugs doesn’t lead to liberty but a drugged out community full of criminals. I was only in my 30’s when I began to think that George Washington screwed things up by not agreeing to become King of America.

        Another outstanding post.I have 2 siblings and my parents are in their late 70s. One of my sisters is a leftist. She is very much estranged from the family because she is a rotten sociopath. My other sister and I despise her. One of the many reasons why is that she is exactly the type of person that Z describes here. She lives in a New Jersey neighborhood that is 75% Js who make upwards of 7 figures a year. There are ZERO blacks in her neighborhood. Zero. In fact, there isn’t much “diversity” at all. Some Whites and mostly Js. Every house has the sign in front about love is love, no human is illegal, black lives matter, etc. etc. If you want to see a mini leftist epicenter you walk through this neighborhood.The minute a black family moves into this neighborhood and JaQuarius starts coming over and stealing cars, breaking into houses or beating up soccer moms, suddenly their tune changes. While they are up on the hill protected by the gates they will preach that you are an evil person for wanting to lock up black criminals. Z is exactly right when he says that these people talk like MLK and live like the KKK. “Diversity is our greatest strength as long as I am as far away from it as possible. That’s for other people’s neighborhoods, not mine though.”Everyone knows who commits all of the crime and can’t behave, even the leftists. They even validate this by dropping standards across all aspects of society just so blacks can “fit in”. They are incapable of thriving in a European society. Eventually, a collision with reality will come, and going off of all of history, reality has an undefeated record.

            I’ve wondered if we have the resources to flip the tables on them. Buy up a property in their neighborhoods, turn it into Section 8 housing, and scrounge up the absolute worst of the worst to move in.
Problem is it’s multi-millions to buy in, and they will trash it, so you will be out the cash. On the other hand, maybe there’s a way to Kelo them…

                Not far off.  They live in propertied areas of extreme value, “block busting” is unlikely.  Not so for the rest of us.  Even in my neighborhood, it seems a simple problem/possibility to rezone from “single residential” to “multi family”.  This was the push toward the end of the Obama era and now once again with a Biden. From there a builder can get government loans and subsidies to erect high density apartments with reserved section 8 housing units on what was once two or three adjacent single family housing plots.It’s a variation the “magic dirt” theory—spread the pathology around and it will go away.

The money’s not there, and even more importantly, the political power isn’t there. When they’re galvanised to protect their neighborhoods and property prices, elected officials listen to them.

            Excellent comment, but you really need to provide the reference and context so you aren’t just writing in some sort of secret code accessible only to those who get the inside joke.
For normies who might be browsing, the quote is from a psychopathic serial killer in the book/movie No Country for Old Men. The killer delivers the line to a rules-driven man just before his murders him.

        “The writer cares more about his precious abstractions than about the thousands of lives saved by these policies.”Quite so. The world inhabited by the politicians, the mass media, the committees is make-believe, of endless jabbering, of futile jousting over semantics. Nothing practical. In my neck of the woods a short strip of road — maybe a quarter mile long — has been closed down for two years while it gets broadened. It’s inconvenient for most of us who have hitherto used it. Each time I take the unpleasant detour it occurs to me that the Chinese would have done the job in two months if not two weeks.This living in cloud-cuckoo land is ubiquitous — you see it in a refusal to acknowledge what’s happening in Ukraine, or the mortal risks of escalation. You see it in the green energy policies in North America and Europe. You see it in the feeble attempts to “onshore” industry that left decades ago. You see it in attempts to educate or civilise ethnic groups that are ineducable.

        The obsession with ideology has been a ~250 year long sideshow, while the liberal/progressive/revolutionary/Enlightenment operation has trudged on. The fact is, if you get a bunch of people of European (or East Asian, I suppose) descent in a place and tell them to organize a government, whatever they do, it will work fine, and if it doesn’t, they’ll try something different. The way it is set up doesn’t really matter. Ideology provides an easy way to distract and divide people.Safety is more important than free market ideals or human rights for criminals. Everybody knows this. Also, crime is a solved problem. The USA had terrible crime until it started locking up criminals and throwing away the key. By definition, a criminal who is kept away from normal people cannot harm them. As soon as activists started pushing for “prison reform” – a totally ideological operation – crime started going up. So, when a deranged hobo with 50 arrests stabs a random women in NYC or throws her into a subway train, there is no reason for this. It doesn’t need to happen. John Leibowitz claimed that freedom means you run the risk of getting stabbed by a deranged hobo, but that is totally ideological. So, ultimately, this is happening because the government, in thrall with this fake ideology, wants it to happen.

        “The old joke about politics was that every candidate ran around promising two cars in every garage and a chicken in every pot.”
For about 100 years, this was the problem.  Every stupid or evil thing politicians wanted to do was justified by the alleged economic benefits.  Even today this is the case.  We have to have mass immigration to appease “The Economy.”  Every single time some politician talks about “our economy,” you’re about to get bent over.

            There’s some truth to that. But equally important in the postmodern age is the asinine notion that diversity is its own good. Mass immigration diversifies us, and that is a holy thing.

        In the end, the reason that things seem to be coming apart is that our politics are dominated by bourgeois posers who have no practical knowledge, so they spend their days conjuring clever word games to play with one another.Things coming apart are a feature and not a bug. Since anarcho-tyranny is the means toward the endpoint, lots of eggs have to be intentionally dropped to make the omelet. The elected bourgeois poseurs are well-paid bit players with no actual power other than to implement their employers’ goals. If they actually try to fix things, TPTB will remove and replace them.In a totalitarian state such as the one devouring us,allopposition to the status quo is controlled and directed in a way that increases the power of those in charge. Is there anything about libertarianism, for example, that the state intelligence agencies, the handmaidens of the elite, would not like? What could be more useful than idiotic policies that facilitate chaos?As for Bukele, his main crime is putting a small dent in mass migration. If he were imprisoning and killing Salvadorans in such a way as to set off an exodus of his people to the United States, the man would be the toast of D.C.No practical knowledge, no results, no problem.

            Jack.Do you think TPTB have a clue as to the level of chaos and dysfunction they are inviting in to modern society with their Imigration, environmental and energy policies as well as the tribalism and loss of productive capacity.
It seems they live in a fantasy world where things happen because they want them to, or they lack the imagination of a policy having undesirable consequences.

No, they live in the real world—it’s just not your world.  (There I go again with “midwittery” semantics).  As noted here many times, these people live and deal with themselves for the most part and have resources the average person can only dream of.  If inflation causes you to have to decide between food and rent, for them it’s just another zero on a check.

        As always, what everyone fears from “The Right” is a figure who refuses to play the game by the rules of the Left, which is, of course Rule 1, which is how we got the Vichy Right in AINO. The Bad Orange Man is a transitional figure, at least in his first term, who began breaking some rules like respecting our broken institutions, and truly terrifying them by hinting he might break others, such as his threat to jail Clinton. Obviously, the BOM’s rhetoric far exceeded his reality, but that’s why he is a transitional figure to an American Bukele, who it seems, is Serious. There’s the other point that causes a G. Patrick Lynch pants shitting terror- a man who Becomes Bukele here in AINO would make the BOM’s popularity look tiny in comparison, not because Normies, Grillers and CivNats are just waiting for a Hitler or a Franco or a Bukele, but theywillenthusiastically support one in power because the one thing history has shown is that Normies will follow anyone who embodies Authority, whether Left or Right, because they are stupid retards.Trump scares these people because he is the first leader, but might not be the only or the last, of an accelerating movement that could become a Movement with a Leader.  He is a nightmarish harbinger.

        I have not seen any articles praising Bukele, only articles complaining about the changes he made to the government and about how heavy handed the gang policy is.
This puts their ideology in sharp focus. Most journalists care far more about the supposed rights of gang members over having a peaceful society where people don’t have to worry about being shot, extorted or robbed.  They do the same thing here.  They only worry about victimizers and not those victimized.  They live in a fantasy world even more disconnected from reality than the libertarians.

        Shorter: Hilariously Blinken showed up in Kiev, and went to a bar (filmed by CNN) to “rock out” playing Neil Young’s “Rocking in the Free World,” while half the Ukranian army dies outside Kharkiv.
No one in his staff told him this was stupid. Nor his support for Zelensky ruling Ukraine as a dictator after his term expires late May — as a signal perhaps that Biden will simply not leave if he loses?
THAT could certainly happen. Biden just refusing to leave; and ruling by decree. Its a plan so stupid only his team could think it up.

        Many years ago when I was in the AF, I went to a school for mid-level captains.  Ostensibly, it’s professional military education, but really it’s a weed-out program.  As part of that 10-12 wk training, you do all sorts of classroom and war games and team building games.  One of them is called flickerball, which is a weird combination of ultimate frisbee, football, and soccer.  Like Calvinball, from the comics, it has intentionally Byzantine rules.  Half of winning is being able to overcome and score despite these rules.it was during flickerball that I learned how effective simply yelling really loud can be to get humans to just start running.  There was a penalty box to which you were sent for breaking a game rule.  2 minutes.  If you leave even a second early…2 more minutes.In my flight was a mix of people of different backgrounds.  But we had 4-5 who were, in my experience, the stupidest people I had ever met.  I didn’t wonder how they got a degree and a commission.  For these people, I couldn’t figure out how they got a high school diploma.  I’ve met unintelligent people before.  This was different.  These folks were stupid.Opposing teams quickly scouted this out.  They would put 3-4 non-playing teammates directly behind the penalty box.  At 1:50 into a 2 min penalty they’d start screaming at our stupid guys “GO IN!  GO IN!  GET IN THE GAME!!!” and these idiots would just start running out onto the field.  It got so bad, that I would take a position player, stand him near and just outside the box, and his only job was to grab and shove the idiot back so we wouldn’t get penalized again.All the opposition had to do was yell like that.  At one point they got one of the idiots to run out three times.  Just by yelling.  It was bizarre, but enlightening.  That’s your below average IQ citizen.  Yell fast, yell repeatedly, and they’ll take off running.Or voting.I think my favorite thing about that school was our day to day classroom instructor assigned to the school.  He freely admitted being in debt counseling because he was incapable of managing his money/spending.  I’d have to sit through feedback sessions on my officer skills with an idiot who couldn’t balance his checkbook taking the moral high ground as the instructor/rater.The weed out course accomplished its goal.  When my service commitment was up, I bailed.

        Anyone who doesn’t despise “policies” and “institutions” is not a genuine dissident – he is a conservatard larping as edgy.  Just like all those who propose endless laws and changes as ‘magic fixes’ regarding the franchise or citizenship or immigration policy.  Lots of sound and fury which utterly ignores demographic reality.  Change the people; change the system.  Simple.  Instead we get proposals and suggestions and rules.  Everyone over 35 wants an outline, a specific ‘plan.’  Get a study team together.  Put forth policy proposals.Most of you remain utterly locked within the liberal philosophical and governmental framework, and cannot see beyond the ‘ideas’ and ‘systems’ mythology you imbibed as children.  It’s yet more theorizing, or vote harder locally, or unquestioning trust in BOM.  Heaven forfend anything practical.  Because it’s not ‘doable’ within the extant system.  But changing the system?  Tipping over the table?  Making substantial changes in your own lives?  Nah.  You’re all too busy getting your kids ready for college and ‘good jobs’ within the system that will never ever change within your or their lifetime, because that is all you know, and all you can conceive of.  Larping normies, the lot of you.

            Breaking the conditioning is a stumbling block for many, and something even we nonconformists can take some time to arrive at. As for “tipping over the table,” anything involving violence or even opinions suggesting the necessity of such à la Tom Jefferson are likely to bring the security state and its stooges down upon your head. As individuals, we face obvious limitations. On the other hand, organizing in groups is likely to get you legal scrutiny (such as law-fare) and maybe even infiltration by Feds.I’m a proponent of parallelism—establishing communities of like-minded people in support of nondestructive lifestyles. We are the Mormons of our day and age (sadly, that denomination has gone rather woke). We need to stay legal, or at least find a place to avoid the Eye of Sauron. In America you can still advocate for our people on sites like this. In countries like the UK, you cannot, and there’s a need for organizations such as Patriotic Alternative to support members who are jailed for “hate” regardless.Under America’s current regime, there may still be enough leeway to escape out-of-control urban dystopia by establishing remote religious colonies like the Mennonites (a back-door to freedom of association). More individualistic dissidents will needat least informalcommunities for trade, homeschooling and, in extreme cases, mutual support during times of unrest. This could work even in an urban setting; though much attention will need to be given to security if the Afrikaners of Johannesburg are any indication.

                    I can feel that vibe. Portland, Oregon, used to be a great place to be. Even New York City. But when the dindus take over the urban areas things become a lot less congenial. Still an economic necessity to live in for many, so we may have to take a lesson from the Afrikaners and make it work for us.
By the way, the Mennonites (actually, Hutterites) I spoke of work in agriculture more as a sidelinenowadays. Mostpracticesome kind of light industry to support the majority of their colonists.

                    I hear you. However, AINO’s cities are beyond redemption. Barring some unforeseeable violent expulsion of malefactors from those cities, we are not retaking them. That being the case, at some point we will have to build our own cities. I predict that, 150 years hence, many towns that now have a population of 5K will be bustling white cities of 250K. We won’t be around to see them, but we just might play a role in building them.

            As mention by Z-man any number of times (and commenters here as well) we have come to think that the process is synonymous with result.  Managers we all are at this level.
As I’ve mention previously, I had a way of “dealing” with university committees I headed up.  I’d simply address a decision hesitant group with a simple line, “Anything worth doing is worth doing wrong”.  Usually worked to get a decision, write it up, and disband.

            It goes deep. Here I am lately questioning Christianity itself lol.Praying in private, saving up treasures in heaven, the spirit of the law instead of the letter, thought instead of deed. Christianity  traditionally favors monarchy, God’s kingdom is within you— all sounds pretty middle class to me!The development of a conscience, the breeding of a man capable of governing himself. Progress!And yet, the church, the liturgy, the sacraments, the hierarchy.We’re stuck in between. It’s a crisis of the middle class. Do we progress or go back? If progress, obviously we need to figure out a different way than men in dresses, etc.

                Paintersform:  You certainly seem to enjoy tying yourself in knots.  It’s quite simple:  Whom do you serve, God or Satan?  If God, then begin by caring for (and that means the physical and mental well being, not soppy emotion) your family and genuine friends, and as able extend that to your people.  Alienraces andreligions are not your neighbors.

                    I think by habit, but at least it’s enjoyable. Life is simple, but people will get in your way. You can run them over, or you can give them a WHY. They like the WHY. They might even follow you for it.
Anyway, crisis and reformation. It’s on to the reformation part.

            What precisely do you mean by institutions? There are concrete institutions such as universities, but also more amorphous ones such as the institution of Christmas. I wholeheartedly support the more nebulous institutions because they are repositories of our civilization’s traditions and customs.

        I remember a student of mine. His body appeared on the beach, torn into pieces.I remember going on the bus and having to bend when the bus was being shot because he has not paid extortion to gang members.Or the nephew of an acquaintance of mine, who was killed because he did not pay extortion. He left a family with no income.Or some members of my prayer group. They used to arrive two hours late, because they were waiting for the gang members to authorize them to get out from their own neighborhood.Or my father-in-law, who lives in a town where everybody stayed home from 7 pm on. After this hour, streets were owned by gangs who killed each other and the police.Or the young girls that lived in poor neighborhoods. If a gang member liked them, they had two options: get laid or get killed. Then they could not escape the neighborhood or have another relationship if they wanted to stay alive.Or the old woman who lived in extreme poverty selling tortillas and had to pay extortion.Or the gang members ordering killings from inside the prison, menacing or buying judges, juries, police and politicians.And I remember people in the safest neighborhoods of New York, Geneva or London lecturing us about human rights…and poor Salvadoran people paying this virtue signaling with blood.Or the members of humanitarian organizations living in.El Salvador in a complex with private security while lecturing about human rights during their safe existenceI remember so many things after 25 years living in the most dangerous country in the world. More dangerous than countries in war.We thought this had no solution. We were used to live this way. Such a beautiful country with rivers of blood.And suddenly I remember all of this disappearing in a short period of time. And people walking in the street safe, even in the middle of the night. And El Salvador flourishing. And people without fear. And a country without blood.To me, it’s a miracle. No wonder president Bukele is a religious man. I have never prayed for any politician, but a pray for this man.You have not lived here in El Salvador. There are no words to describe what president Bukele did here. I hope these brush strokes give you an idea. I can speak about this without emotion.God bless president Bukele, El Salvador, the USA and all the men of good will. No matter what other people say.

            What did we in America have to do with Bukele’s turnaround project other than naysaying and obstructionism before it was complete and, later, naysaying and cheering about the success? I’d wager that the truth is awkward. Following the money used by those “humanitarian” organizations during the bad times is certain to lead back to tax policy favored by Western “conservatives” for charitable contributions. It will lead also to law and public policy which favors gigantic, market-dominating concentrations of assets, also favored by “conservatives”.Remember now how long do-gooders planned their revenge against Pinochet on the pretext of human rights. They will seek the same against Bukele, and the money to finance their activity will be dependent upon “conservative” law and policy tinkerers then, too.On the bright side of things, there will be an AWFL die out during the next 40 years in the West. Many AWFL’S and their daughters are all jabbed up with the holy mRNA sauces, and their loathing for motherhood is already a factor of their plunging birth rates. This will provide some relief from NGO pests, but it won’t be enough.The AWFL’s are zombies of crabby yentas who will find other useful idiots for subversive activism, and there will be huge pools of capital sloshing around in the coffers of NGO’s with which to hire people and to pay for projects. Yentas and their brothers were greatly overrepresented among advisers who helped Maoists to take over China. You would do well to prepare snares for them in El Salvador.

        A few points:First, here is the bio for G. Patrick Lynch. I’m certain he is a good and decent man, but he went straight from undergrad to a masters and PhD program into academics and then to think tank side gigs. It appears he has never held a job in the dreaded private sector, and has probably lived in academic and demographic bubbles his entire life.https://www.adamsmithworks.org/people/g-patrick-lynchSecond, on the national level in the US the shift in rhetoric from the practical to the aspirational started with the Obama campaign in 2008. That time period coincides nicely with the widespread integration of Diebold’s electronic voting systems into US elections, which began in 2003. These systems were notoriously unsecure, and eventually drew widespread media attention and eventually an order from the US Department of Justice requiring Diebold to divest the subsidiary that operated the system. These assets were acquired by (wait for it…) Dominion Voting Systems. In short, politicians no longer address practical issues like economics, crime, etc., because they have perfected election rigging systems to the point where they no longer need to address voters’ issues. “Our Democracy” has become a farcical failure.As an aside, Diebold was tied to Republicans and the Bush family, and the initial security concerns sprang from the political left. Of course, now that the assets are with Dominion, which is allied with the Democrats, those concerns have evaporated.Third, the biggest false dichotomy presented in the article is the presentation of communist strongmen (Peron, Kirchner, Chavez, Maduro, Ortega) as morally equivalent to right-leaning strongmen (Pinochet). They are not. The communists destroyed every aspect of their respective countries while massively enriching themselves, as communists have always done. By contrast, Pinochet saved his country by restoring order and a functioning government. To any sane mind, the answer to Lynch’s rhetorical question about whether Pinochet was worth it is a resounding: YES.

        That’s why Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines was appealing.  Don’t know how committed or honest he was to getting rid of the drug dealers, but he gave no quarter in his rhetoric and made for one hell of a fun D.A.R.E. T-shirt.
but anyway the Marcos family reign again so go figure

        Hrrrrrmmmmmmmm. Is the insistence on playing witty word games a cause, or an effect?”What we lack are men willing to use the state to solve actual problems…”I’m not sure I agree. If someone does come forward and actually tries to do something, the managerials, the swamp creatures and special interest groups will tear him to shreds.I think our side needs to do a Soviet style purge where the managerials and elite are stood up against a wall and shot at random as a warning to the others. As it is none of these guys can even play a decent word game. The drunks are in charge of the liquor store. Our side better start getting serious about accountability and corruption… because this can only get worse as it drags on. We are past the point of no return.

            Scratch a “libertarian”, and you will find a knave or a dupe of Judeo-European turbocapitialism. Virtually the whole point of it all is to atomize resistance, asthis guycould surely tell you in private if he were in a mood to let slip some truth about it. The nameGrove, too, is highly suspect. Reading up and downthe roster of knaves and dupesone finds the usual “Western” superabundance of Heebish names, which no good nationalism can have for long without it being or becoming one with Zion’s axis of darkness and biocide.

        I noticed the genocidal maniacs have a coordinated mass-murder denial campaign going on led by having having blackmailed the UN to publicly pretend the Israeli’s aren’t really slaughtering and starving all the Palestinian women and children. At the very same time principled jewish officers in the DIA, who obviously have much better window on the truth, are making news by publicly resigning their posts in protest of our government’s complicity in the Israeli crimes. It’s strangely satisfying to see how the people I already find despicable go out of their way to make themselves ever more hideous.

Creativity is the ne-plus-ultra, s’what everybody “wants tobe.” But it’s a rare gift: very few have it. And those that DO have it, cannot apply it universally and ubiquitously.
(“Folks” have a very dfficult time acknowledging that (high) intelligence and creativity are not necessarily correlated.)

        My favorite false dichotomy comes from Dan, and you know who I’m talking about.
First he repeatedly spouts the phrase “kill the Jews” like he has Tourette’s Syndrome. And then proclaims that the only two options in Gaza are to genocide innocent Palestinian women and children or allow Hamas to exist and threaten the Israelis. And he clearly favors the former solution. And he is a Jesus fanatic. And he sees no contradictions whatsoever in the above.

        Somewhat long but related: Ghandi and King understood that having the proto-AWFLs on their side and not posing too much of a threat to most White men could have their way. This worked like gangbusters on Western, affluent, oligarchical societies where rich White women habitually get most of their way most of the time. [Both spent a LOT of time hanging out with socialites. If you take my meaning and I am sure you do.]HOWEVER, the flip side which we are seeing in Israel, in China, in Burma, now in Ireland (small but growing), Japan, and other places is that the AWFLs can get over-ruled when threats become too big to ignore and cannot be fled from.The Mau Mau in Kenya, the Algerians, were able to chase the British and French out of their nations by tribal terror. The sort of the thing the Souix Indians did to the Minnesotans during the Civil War, or the Cherokee to Southerners (and other Cherokee) in the Red Stick War, or the Blackhawks during Pontiac’s War, or the Comanche to everyone until they were effectively wiped out. The difference was, the British and French had somewhere to flee to. The Minnesotans, the Texans, the Southerners, the Illinois settlers, did not have anywhere to go back to; they faced ruin and poverty turning east.Civilized people whether Chinese reacting to Uighur knife mass attacks or Israelis to October 7, just will not put up with tribal raiding for long no matter how much AWFLs wail. It is worth noting that a number of Communist Party officials in China went to prison protesting the Uighur “kinder, gentler” genocide. [But genocide is what it is, for all intents and purposes, see: Tibet.]The Irish have nowhere to go and nothing to lose now that America is basically closed off to them, and the government pours more immigrants in by the day. So you see “centers” being burnt down and construction crews “persuaded” to find other work. Japan is seeing in response to the Kurds imported, a resurgence of previously laughable societies. Like the Black Dragon or Deep Ocean Societies. [If you believe Derb.]We can be reaching that tipping point across the Western world. I think it is worse in Europe than here since they have less physical mobility and more Muslims acting tribal, we have ours mostly African variety concentrated in cities. And thus more avoidable for most. Butenough going out to the suburbs (immigrants “churn” the black population out to the suburbs) and you get the tipping point in Israel. It did not just “happen” because of 10/7, it was the culmination of twenty years or more of Intifada and various atrocities that eroded any concept of “deals.”TLDR: Europeans, Americans, Chinese, Japanese, other civilized peoples can reach a sudden tipping point and no amount of AWFL wailing or pseudo-intellectual midwit moaning can dissuade the population, usually with a leader who appears out of nowhere, from taking action to basically exterminate the tribal forces causing massive disruption to daily life. Civilized people just cannot live with anarcho-tyranny forever and at scale. They just cannot and will not.Related: Speaker Johnson and a lot of Republican Senators are showing up at the Trump Trial in NYC to denounce the judge and the trial as crooked and directed by Biden. [They understand the means will NOT stop at Trump and there is a lesson there. Tolerance for abuse can suddenly just snap without “warning” though it is there if looked for.]

        Ugh, guys like that give libertarianism a bad name. What’s worse is I used to think that way. Freedom is wonderful and necessary, but this fellow has the “I have only a hammer so everything’s a nail” syndrome. What is government for if not to protect its citizens from violent crime? We don’t want to go full fascist because the deregulation approach doesn’t work in this case. But before we can discuss the fine points of civil rights there has to be an environment where civil discourse is possible.

                That’s where we part ways. I want nothing to do with forced socialism of any variety.
Fortunately, those who do want full fascist are too few in number to make any difference, but I’m more than willing to refuel helicopters loading up the fascists and communists alike…

In whose name(s) are the helicopters owned?
Looks like your own militarist police state is the camel’s nose of what you pretend to oppose.

        This is just the old saw about Mussolini making the trains run on time. Such policies are often wildly popular in the beginning but they have a tendency not to end well. The bourgeoisie loves a “tough-on-crime” guy when they need someone to dig them out of the mess, but then they become ever more indulgent and demanding, placing eventually unsupportable strains on the national treasury. The same politician who once rode that tiger to victory is seldom the one who has enough fortitude to leap off it and tell it to stop.

            ID. However what was shown as examples was not Mussolini, but Cincinnatus and Pinochet. There are others, of modern times, as well, e.g. Franco of Spain. Your assertion (dictators will inevitably produce worse outcomes than what they were created to solve) is simply and adequately refuted by those examples. Not much different between good Kings and bad Kings throughout history, or the series of “good” emperors listed/described by ancient Roman historians.
A drowning man does indeed clutch at straws, but sometimes those straws are strong enough to save him.
