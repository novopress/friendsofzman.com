        Its called culling the herd in personal service firms, or the 80/20 rule. You make the most money from the 20% but you waste the most time on the 80%, unless you systematically cull the herd. One thing I am pretty sure is true, is Panera also was cheap as hell. The most demanding/irritating/time wasting customers are the cheap skates, because they dont recognize value.
At some point you get smart and start to get rid of them. The fastest and best is just to fire them, the next best is double the hourly fee.

        No amount of money?Let me tell y’all about doing business withfolks from the “fashion” industry.There’s this thing called a Change Order.Essentially, it’s a fine for stupidity.OTOH, the nice well balanced folks in that industry consistently cry poverty, and “forget to sign” their payment checks a lot.Along with Change Order, there’s this thing called a Fax Machine. I’m pretty sure the tears of agony from the folks buying the “iced cappys”, wine, and delivered lunches from the deli, instead of paying the bills, out-flowed the dramatic “tears of joy” at the end of the runway show during Fashion Week.
