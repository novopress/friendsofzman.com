        I hate to be one of those guys shaking their fists at the 20th Amendment, but I wonder if the feminization of politics is also a big cause of the death of Christianity.  As I understand it, many of the most devout early converts to Christianity were women because Christianity put such strong emphasis on the importance of a monogamous family and preached that women had a very important role to serve.  Metaphorically, men’s relationship to their wives was supposed to be the same as Jesus’ relationship to the church.  Now that the predominant “family” unit in the U.S. is headed by either an unwed mother or cat-lady supported one way or the other by the govenment, there’s no need for Christian doctrine to elevate the status of women.  Government in fact elevates their statusoverthat of men in return for support.

                Remind me of one of my dad’s favorite jokes:A husband’s wife told him he needed to get in touch with his feminine side. He went on a huge shopping spree and crashed the car.

                    That’s a great line.  Though I would extend it to say the money and power is held by the teenager’s father, who gives his son whiskey and car keys to distract from the fact that he is stealing from his neighbors.

            The 19th Amendment simply speeded up and standardized a process that was long in the works.  Many States already allowed women the right to vote, particularly the newer States of the West.  The retraction of the 19th Amendment will do little to nothing to change this “right”.  Much like the overturn of Roe vs Wade did little to nothing to change abortion “rights”.

This is modern revisionist propaganda used to justify feminist rebellion. Read the primary sources from those of the early church. Barely any mention of women at all.

                A pagan Roman commentator noted that Christianity was the religion of slaves and women, both in the lower classes.
Yes, the primary sources are almost entirely male focused, because that’s the hierarchy of the formal church. The apostles were all male, etc.

            It’s the Judaization of politics that caused this hostility toward Christianity in official circles. It parallels to what happened in the Soviet Union, also another Jewish abomination.

            What death of Christianity? We’re still around. Christianity as religion of most of the masses is admittedly under some issue right now.Anyway, if anything it’s the lack of observing Christian belief that brought women to the fore front in public life. The same passage that tells men to love their wives as Christ loved the Church also tells women to submit to their husbands.Catholicism, as socially agreeing with the world as it seems, still has a male only priesthood.Christianity can cope with a world that has put women in charge. At some point, it hopefully can help bring it back to a patriachary, but that’s not the goal of Christianity.

        The wife of the youth pastor, a more modern woman, was offended by the sermon.
Taking women and their feeling’s seriously is the biggest crisis facing the entire world today. Replacing democracy, expelling a certain foreign tribe, securing the border — none of these things will improve anything (or even be possible to implement) so long as society collectively and at an individual level takes or suspends actions merely because woman offended.

            This is why any “optimism” is a ridiculous exercise.  None of those things will ever happen so there is no saving the west.  It will become extinct in the generations to come and be thrown into the dustbin of history.  What could have been won’t even be discussed because it breaks the rules of the egalitarian paradise.  in 100 years “America” will be a shithole of epic proportions.

                    To be fair, it doesn’t take much in the way of testicular fortitude. All it takes is to be in the company of men who do think the woman’s role is as part of the “sandwich ministry”.  Still a thing in my neck of the woods.

        Surely it goes back even further than the French Revolution? Protestantism has that each person can read the Bible for himself, and by implication interpret it for hmself or herself. No authority figure — priest, bishop, pope — can interpret the Bible for a Protestant. It is natural, then, that interpretation will suit the way of life and conduct of the person in question. What is not palatable in the Bible or its interpretation will be ignored or suppressed. And consequently any pastor placing emphasis on some uncomfortable truths in the Bible will be thrown out on his ear. In other words, Protestantism does not allow for some authoritative religious figure (i.e., clergyman) who cannot be challenged.What I see in my neck of the woods is people “shopping” around for churches and the pastors that go with them. They want a church and pastor who will soothe and placate them. Not one who will point out their moral failings or what hypocrites they are. And the churches are anxious to please them — they’re fighting for paying customers and market share. The loans on their church construction has to be paid off as well as paying the salaries of the pastors and other staff. religion has become another capitalist commodity.

            Yes, Sola Scriptura is the ultimate thing to blame and democracy derives from that. If any person can have his own interpretation of the Bible, the only way to agree on something is voting.
There are no official goods and evils: only counting votes. Sola Scriptura introduces relativism in the Western civilization and no civilization can survive relativism, because a society needs people to agree on what is good and what is evil. The rest is individualism and destroying society because each person does whatever he sees fit.

                An interesting aspect of Biblical interpretation is that it often gets back to “translation” and understanding of long dead languages and their common usage of the time.  Most people are not that savvy, or educated enough to understand the implications of seemingly minor changes in text translations.  Heck, Google any passage and see the list of Biblical translations for such.  Some fundamentally quite different from one another.

                “the only way to agree on something is voting.”
Only matters if you care to form a consensus with people who are wrong.
Bible says there aren’t many who are going to find the narrow gate. There’s nothing to be gained by agreement.

                Well, there are really two blades to that pair of scissors shredding Christianity:
I suppose Christendom could have remained intact with SS, so long as it was being interpreted solely by the appointed authority. The ZOG at least pays lip service to this by having the SCROTUS as its “appointed authority” although it is cynically manipulated seven ways to Sunday.

                Our rulers HAVE agreed on what is good and what is evil.It’s pretty much rock solid with them, whether you look at the Ruling Class, or its adjuncts in the Administrative and Managerial (whatever you want to call them) elites, as well as the Cognitive, Creative, Corporate and Political classes.They know we are Other — Barbarians, Gaijin, Heratics, Unclean … whatever.  They may argue amongst themselves about the various permutations of their new construct.  But they are absolutely united about one thing — We are not inside the fence line.We must be marked as the Beast, then marginalized, ostracized, silenced, then isolated and destroyed …. if we do not convert, or signal our permanent submission.Anyone storing up popcorn to eat while watching them self-destruct is delusional.

                Traditional mission work involves comfortable people getting off their hind ends and living some place uncomfortable. The savage is converted in his home. The modern habit of importing people and not converting them is entirely relatively development.

            I was about to post more or less the same comment.  People read their own biases and the Bible always agrees with whatever their prior beliefs were before they picked that Bible up for the first time.
For all the problems of Catholicism (I’m a Catholic) and the convergence of the Church, hierarchy is the only solution along with publishing the Bible in a language nobody can read.  At least the Vatican can be fixed in theory.  There is no fixing Protestantism.

                    That’s definitely true! He warns us of false prophets, and makes plain that there are consequences to following the wrong prophets. You are judged not on how closely you hew to what your holy man says, but rather, whether you do as He says. (John 15. 15:14 for the impatient.)
Your eternal soul depends on whether you are right. Or more to the point, whether some pope ages ago was right. How can you KNOW? He says if you search diligently…

                    “Muslims can read their religious text without the dissolute culture appearing as you see in France right now.”
They have their own Imams, Mullahs, and Ayatollahs telling them what is and is not acceptable interpretation. Also the bulk of them can’t understand Arabic anyway (only around 20% are Arabs) so the Quran more or less remains a closed book to them (translations into the vernacular are not encouraged). In other words, Islam as most serious Moslems understand it (i.e., that means excluding noggers) is filtered through a body of clerics. Like Catholicism.

                        Catholicism is unique in her hierarchy, because there is a hierarchy. There is no equivalent of Peter’s successor in Islam.Further, the Bible was produced by the Church. It’s not an issue of trying to interpret one man’s fever dreams in ancient Arabic. It’s much different scenario of the publisher of the book telling people what it means.Much of teaching of Catholicism is simply common sense. Some of it’s mystical. Other than a few assumptions and/or revelations, it’s possible to reverse engineer almost all of it.

                    We Catholics have maintained doctrine. Pick anything major people hate, like the teaching on divorce and it’s stayed the same since Jesus taught it to his disciples.The practice of the faith and reactions to shifting social conditions (ie the death penalty), yes do change. However, that’s the example in the New Testament itself with the Council at Jerusalem. A living Church changes with it’s need to react to new developments in human history.Protestantism happened in part because of a massive corruption in the Western Church, along with some other social tinder that was already there. Interestingly it only really takes hold in the last peoples to be Christianized, the Germans, the Dutch, and the English. Even the English were a tad squirrelly about their Catholicism by all outward indications. From a certain POV, Protestantism can be seen as almost a failed attempt at a completed conversation. Even then their are small groups of Germans, Dutch, and English who are way more Catholic than I’ll ever be.(Sorry for the mispost)

                    Protestantism happened because English didn’t like being ruled by Italians. Not very complicated. This friction dates back WAY before the reformation.  As an Italian soul living under English rules today I understand their frustration completely. Both sides have their good and bad, but regardless they can’t co-exist under the same set of doctrines.That said, I am speaking of the real Protestantism, the one that matters historically, meaning the one created by King Henry.  Luther was merely the pick that first broke the ice imo.  He was silver to Henry’s gold. The potatoes to Henry’s steak.for you outsiders thinking this was all about theology or doctrinal differences, no.  It wasn’t about that. It’s never about that.  It’s always a blood feud.

        This is a good essay, and its central question is an important one. But the question can be extended. Hence, can any people in a democracy who value democracy above their own people survive? You know what I’m driving at here. If the majority in democracies decide to enact sweeping anti-white policies are white people obligated to accept their own disempowerment, subjugation and possible elimination because the will of the people claims this is the best thing for all?Post-war whites have proved themselves far more loyal to the concept of democracy than to their own extended family, and that family is increasingly imperiled. Of that, there can be very little doubt.

            Post-war whites have proved themselves far more loyal to the concept of democracy than to their own extended family, and that family is increasingly imperiled. Of that, there can be very little doubt.
That is Truth and for the life of me I just don’t understand that…

            I believe you are touching upon what I was taught as a youngster in school. Democracy is retrained via “The Bill of Rights”—really those original principles of the Founders and the “people of the time” as to what could or could not become binding “law”.So the adage that “Democracy is two wolves and one sheep decide what to eat for dinner” would not occur in practice because sheep have “rights”. Those rights were not “given” by the Founders, but were *recognized* by the Founders. They simply restated, and mostly left to assumption, what was the common understanding and practice of the people of the time.I maintain that if we had retained the “people of the time”—White, Northern European in the main—we’d have many less problems today with “democracy”, however you wish to define it.Our new adage for today, “Import the third world, become the third world” rings all too true given our historical background and current situation.

                An important point. As ever, demographics are probably more determinative than  any economic or political system. Alas, America began to get its demographics wrong when it actually was something of a democracy, in contrast to Our Democracy. It seems to me that even when the demographics are good, democracy is susceptible to crashing and burning. I just really don’t trust it anymore.

Ima stop you right there. You do realize the wheels started coming off in Washington’s first term, right? The Whiskey Rebellion was about people who had been using liquor for money, because it was so difficult to transport corn in bulk through the Pennsylvania backcountry, and were now told they would have to pay a tax on their money, right? Adams’ administration made criticism of the President a jailable offense, for Pete’s sake. Almost the entire country was English, and the women and minorities got no votes in the matter.

                        Yes, our idea of Our democracy coming from the Founders is truly a modern myth. The Founding Fathers did indeed create a republic with aristocratic representatives and man who was supposed to temporarily replace a King for the people. They hated democracy as rule of the mob.It was also quite the shock to Plato’s opinion of democracy, when I finally read that work.

                I have long thought that if you get a bunch of European people to occupy a plot of land, whatever government they come up with will mostly work fine for a long amount of time. It really doesn’t matter how the government is arranged at all. Scandinavian socialism worked as long as the populations of those states were Scandinavian. In part because we are talking about high IQ, intelligent, hardworking people, but also because they got together and configured a society that suited their norms and values, so they implicitly accepted the social compact and they also implicitly lived it. The configuration of the government does not matter as much as the people, something the Founders also recognized.Likewise, you throw a bunch of people from all corners of the world into a plot of land, it’s not that they would come up with a government that doesn’t work, they wouldn’t even come up with one, because it would be total chaos. And we see that today. This focus on ideological or if we just push the levers of bureaucracy this way or that things will fall into place and work perfectly is just a distraction from the basic reality.

This is the only plausible explanation for why the early Constitutional Republic went as badly as it did. Even the radical Jefferson succumbed to it.

            “Post-war whites have proved themselves far more loyal to the concept of democracy than to their own extended family, and that family is increasingly imperiled. Of that, there can be very little doubt.” Time for some random generational theory. 🙂 Yes, the Silents and the Boomers are committed to democracy, in part because the WWII were a very democratic people.Those several generations really like the idea of everyone being “equal”. If not a suit and tie and brill cream for everyone, it’s Steven Jobs wearing farmer pants and a black turtle neck, also for everyone.Unfortunately Silents and the Boomers also suffer from a group indifference to their children. In being generally self indulgent, their extended family is of little concern. It’s a little selfish to value ideas more than your family and I’m sorry to say all of society was primed to encourage that in them.That said, for the average Millenials and younger, they don’t have use for “democracy”. Democracy is not having a job, letting people you don’t like say things you don’t like, and just generally a stress inducing moment of chaos. A love of democracy in whites has an expiration date in other words. It’s just not going to be tomorrow probably.

                “Unfortunately Silents and the Boomers also suffer from a group indifference to their children.”
It’s the children who became indifferent to their parents. Sure, the parents sold the house and moved to Florida or Arizona, but only after the kids moved out and scattered across the country. Which is a consequence of the destruction of small business.
When Johnny could marry his high school sweetheart and get a job in town, the extended family could remain vital. Not so when married some shrew who hates flyover and they live in a condo in the big city.

        Christianity and “democracy” (or something vaguely resembling it which goes by that name) have coexisted quite well for a very long time, so there’s no particular reason that they couldn’t continue. Except for the reason it ran up against in ZMan’s Baptist example.  Proud and unrestrained feminine power which will not tolerate any offense to its feelz. A problem that “democracy” also runs into. The problem is neither christianity nor “democracy.”
I guarantee you if the pastor had stood up there and preached that men must do x, y, and z, there would not have been a protest.

                The Christians thought the feminine problem important enough that they put a story on the nature of woman right up at the front of their book. It’s one of the 2 or 3 parts of the bible that everyone, christian or non christian, knows. Yet still, here we are.

                    I don’t think so.  It’s very easy for any system to go off the rails in a gynocentric society.  It’s hard to argue China is a democracy and it has many of the same problems.
It’s not even clear democracy is the cause of gynocentrism.  All the stupidity of gynocentrism starts in the ruling class.  It’s not like the ruling class is conforming to popular opinion.  Instead, popular opinion is conforming to the ruling opinion.

                        Perhaps. That said, matriarchy is far more prevalent in democracies than any other form of government, and I don’t think that is coincidental. The rulers may instigate, but the masses validate. Both sides of the equation are important, even essential.

            Democracy as presently used by liberals in the media and democrats, is supposed to encompass all things good. That is NOT what our Founders thought. They understood that the bottom line was democracy had never worked  anywhere in the world where it had been tried. A woman asked Ben Franklin a question as he left Independence Hall …”Mr. Franklin …what do we have?” His reply was..”A Republic madam…if we can keep it.” Todays liars… todays fools are constantly spewing their mantra of “our precious democracy” to whomever will listen. My advice is to ignore their mendacity. Promote our Republic. Be a true American.

                Feel for you, dude. Like most here, I think we are way beyond “Promoting Our Republic.” It’s dead, Jim.
Unlike most, I don’t think there’s nothing that can be done. We can always promote our interests. Every time I read comments here, hoping for other ideas, I’m reminded of Veggie Tales.
I’ve never been to Bwoston in the fwall.

        Good essay.I might also add that in the 20th century the Spanish Civil War showed that the Catholic Church was the main target of destruction for the” republicans”. The forces of eglatarianisnin within Spain had to destroy any other moral authority. A good book on that period is The Last Crusade by Warren Carroll.These same forces are at work in North America in the 21st century.

            My understanding of Italian fascism or Mussolini really was that this was the last gasp of the Catholics to wrest control from the secularists, of many kinds.  Or iow a challenge to modernity in its many forms. I know people like to make Italian fascism into this abstract concept, but knowing my family who was there at the time it was always really about the Catholics versus the Jews.  Fascists were the Catholics.  Commies were the Jews.  Everyone saw it that way too.  I know Z likes Paul Gottfried and considers his writing on the topic to be superb scholarship, but maybe for academic educational or classroom scholastic purposes it is. But if someone wants the common person’s view and what was the animating feature, then it should be seen as a battle between the Catholics and the Jews.  Or the wops and the kikes.in fact if you look hard enough you can see those differences are still smoldering just beneath the surface.  Why no one should be surprised that many of the leading opponents of Israel or Jewish culture in general have a last name that ends in a vowel.

                This is all accurate, however, like the Germans that part of history has been largely purged from the public conscious. You will find almost no Italian who understands this nuance just as you will find few Germans that know the full story behind how &amp; why the Reich came to be. The years of crushing economic policy/poverty, debauchery, (((foreign influence))), sanctions, all of it.Speaking about Fascism in Italy is like trying to talk about National Socialism in Germany, do so VERY carefully because it is a very sore subject still. We from the outside looking in have much clearer vision because these battles and wars were not fought in our backyard. Germans and Italians in some people’s still living memory remember American bombs falling on their heads and being invaded by the Allies, etc.General Patton was very prescient in his comment speculating about having fought for the wrong side.It is just in recent years that some Italians, like some Germans, have started to come out of the thick fog of propaganda that has blanketed the place since the end of the war. This is still very much a 3rd rail topic that will evoke a visceral negative response from most Italians.

                Falcone: Jewish museum in Florence has on display a lot of Fascist Party Jewish members identifications. The original fascism was extremely popular with Italian Jews, as it was a Mussolini”s variant of socialism (Mussolini was originally a communist).Mussolini himself was not antisemite, and a lot of European Jews flew to Italy until 1943 to escape Holocaust you don’t believe in.Only in 1943 under Hitler’s pressure the Jews in Italy were rounded up and sent to camps.Vittorio De Sica’s 1970 movie “The Garden of Finzi Continis” depicts this part of Italian-Jewish saga, which is over 2000 years old.

                    “Mussolini himself was not antisemite, and a lot of European Jews flew to Italy until 1943 to escape Holocaust you don’t believe in.” Hitler was rounding people up into concentration camps. Nobody argues that. Of course people would want to escape a minimum security prison where food supplies could be cut at any time. It is “blood libel” ,however, to accuse Hitler and particularly the German people of a mass murder wish.

                    This is true.
Then again Italian Jewry had fewer of the highly endearing (heh) Ashkenazi traits (*) which seem to have developed during and post genetic bottleneck after they moved into Germany and were therefore more (ahem) Tolerable.
*Ignoring minor historical details like burning down the Venice Arsenal in the lead up to Lepanto to help the Ottomans. To be fair (much as I hate to be), that’s no more treacherous than the Bourbon kings of France were in their dealings with the Turks contra rest of Christendom.

            An apposite post. And also a signal example of why the wanton dispensation and ingestion of black pills is foolish, albeit understandable. There have been many dark times in the past–for Christianity, for whites–some of them perhaps even darker than the present, yet here we are, still alive if not kicking quite so energetically as in past times. Somehow, someway, we will ultimately prevail. We always do.

                    As a “cradle Catholic” vintage 1946, no longer a Roman Catholic in metaphysics but quite so in morals and ethics, I can only say that in its present avatar with its present pontiff, no, it’s in no way a “glorious time” to be a Catholic.

                        I am Catholic, I confess my sins regularly, I go to church every Sunday, I listen to the readings (which are laid out in a regular schedule for, presumably, the remainder of human history) and the homily, I take the Eucharist, I leave in a slightly better mood than I went in, and I try to live my life as a decent Catholic. What is my point, the present avatar with its present pontiff has very little influence on my life as a person or a Catholic. I respect his position as the head of the Church and that’s it. This present pontiff may be, erm, problematic to say the least, but I can say with total certainty he will not be the present pontiff forever.

                            To give you some hope, I have come to believe the current pontiff has been subject to a decade of fake news. He’s not an American conservative, but he’s not unorthodox either.Either way, yes, there’s always a new pontiff on the horizon.

                                I don’t see how any of this is helpful to any Catholic. If he is not the Pope then God will judge him accordingly when it is his time. I wasn’t in the room and I don’t know and have to have faith that the actions of Benedict, Francis, and all the bishops were guided by the Holy Spirit.Yet this sort of talk just undermines and divides an institution that desperately needs unity. If this talk stops one person from going to their local church, where, as you point out, the sacraments are still valid no matter who is in Rome, then you are doing a grave disservice to both that person and the Church.

                        I’m afraid that the present Pontiff is subject to a great deal of fake news. He may in fact be the saint we needed, not the one we wanted.
In the that, it is a glorious time to be a Catholic.

Jorge is NOT the pope. Never has been.
He is an evil man (and a homosexual, I believe), and a plant by the Cabal.
Benedikt XVI resigned ingrate error.do not be fooled or scandalized.and for Heaven’s sake (literally), so read some Ann Barnhardt!!
None of what happens within the hierarchy changes that Jesus is present in the Eucharist.Start there.

        And people wonder why the Orthodox Church and some traditional Catholic parishes are gaining so many converts!I’ve noticed the number of non-biblical, non-denominational churches with no iconography, no judgement and no message of love and redemption. No mention of hell, but hey, Jesus loves you!Their buildings are nothing more than multi-purpose empty halls with a message as changeable and as empty as their seating arrangements.I call them happy-clappy, rockband Jesus churches. They’re Sunday social clubs.It’s not Christianity. I’m sure there are some nice people there, but they’re not worshipping the one, true God. They instead worship themselves and as Z has pointed out, democracy.Just because a majority of people want non-stop butt sex, race-mixing, endless immigration and other decadence doesn’t make it right. Without an objective view of right and wrong, you have the endless gray confusion of our present age.Our democracy has led us to rule by faceless administrators who answer to no one and dictate how much water your washing machine can use, how many airbags your car needs, how high railings in an industrial plant must be, etc.There’s got to be a better way to govern. The shame is I don’t have a suggestion in that regard.

            Some of them are getting converts in a highly modernistic reaction to modernity. They are going to the Orthodox and “traditionalist” Catholic parishes attempting to recreate a Christianity that never was. It’s simply the flip side of the rock band movement, because it’s all about how people feel about it, not what’s real.

                Haha, nice catch. But it only matters if you capitalize the “S” and the “F” which would be a pretty high honor for a murderer.  Barabbas can also be translated as son of the teacher, which would indicate that his father was a Jewish leader. This would strengthen my understanding of that story.

                        The mob could have shouted to release the Messiah, or the Son of David (most probable), or even his given name, a version of Joshua which means “God saves”.Yes, good catch in terms of irony.

                            The best case I can see is that Satan created the situation where the ambiguity would work such that He would be nailed to a cross, and The Plan be subverted.
But, again, the people in the mobs and the early church would have known the meanings of these words. Why no explanation?

                                There was no ambiguity. The mob that day most probably would be asking for the Son of David if they wanted Jesus. That’s his most common title of address by the Jews who believed in him. Messiah is a close second.  “Son of the Father” is title that Jesus gives himself during the Gospels, but not that day. I can not think of a time where anyone address him by that title.That Satan had the mobs howling to release the “son of the father” and they received the cold blooded murder they clearly wanted is about Satan having it’s day. As far as I understand it, Satan likes to “play” like that.

        Christianity is compatible with democracy, but Puritanism is absolutely not. Because those fanatics will not abide democracy thwarting their need to control everything within reach. From Cromwell to Lincoln, Puritans overrode democracy with armies and cannons. Cromwell dissolved Parliament, and reigned as an uncrowned king, and Lincoln imposed Yankee Puritan morality on the South at the point of a bayonet.

        Jesus did not ask the Apostles what to do, or call a vote, he was the leader and they followed him. Hierarchy is the natural order of humanity and democracy is a natural subversion of that. Can Christianity survive democracy? Of course not, for evidence look around. The most powerful Christian force we had in this age of democracy post-WW2, the “Moral Majority”, was largely a Zionist operation. When somebody puts on a blatantly obscene, offensive, and blasphemous display, as they did a few days ago in Paris, Christians are told that they need to submit before the “god of the people” and accept that the “people” have a right to offend them and there is nothing they can do about it. You cannot even appeal to politeness and say that since we all have to live amongst each other, we should have some basic respect for one another, because they have no basic respect for Christians and are not afraid of saying so. It’s largely a spent force in the West, especially in Europe but also in the USA.

            Christianity will survive, it has since Jesus.  What changes is Christianity’s organized face.  We often conflate the two.
Matthew 18:20 (King James Version) “For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.”
Some of my most admired individuals wrt Christian practice congregate in their homes with small bands of fellow Christian’s—having given up on larger organizations as having become too “worldly.”  As far as I’m concerned, let the secular forces of today purify the “Church” by exposing those elements that would weaken and change Belief to the worldly.

            Christianity can (and will) survive democracy – it has survived far worse. Whether it will “thrive” under democracy is a different question (also depends on what you mean by “thrive”).
A more relevant question is what kind of society will you have in which Christianity does not thrive?  We are seeing glimpses.
As for being a spent force, I suppose you could say in some ways.  Another way to see it is a purification of nominal Christians or cultural Christians.

                What I meant was that Christianity cannot really exist in a democratic society. And it can’t. We see that today. A Christian has to either subvert his or her beliefs entirely or subsume them to the liberal order. But this western liberal democracy is going to fall apart long before Christianity does, absolutely.

            Yep.
Nietzsche wrote that Christianity is “Plato for the masses.” It’s hierarchical and anti-democratic.
Christianity is only egalitarian insofar as it believes that everyone has value in the eyes of God, but its ethical and moral principles have been historically developed by a hierarchical priesthood loosely modeled after the concept of Plato’s guardians.

        The founding fathers were aware of the perils of Democracy, and that it is like a virus that eventually consumes individual rights,which is why they enshrined our rights as God given.  WhenBen Franklin said the newly formed government was “a republic, if you can keep it”, he had no illusions about its fragility. We kept it more or less from 1787 to 1860, and it has been a race to tyranny ever since.

            In principle correct.  However “democracy” seems now a term of art.  I can’t point to a single case of the original Athenian form of democracy currently extant—albeit, I’ve not looked very hard. So we term our Republic a “democracy”, so what.  With such broad understanding, the Roman Empire was a democracy.  We might be better off ditching the term, “democracy”.

                However “democracy” seems now a term of art.To my knowledge, only Americans use the terms “republic” and “democracy” as mutually exclusive.The German Federal Republic (by no coincidence) mirrors the American federal republic, with a president, federated states with their own legislatures, government and judicial, and a two-chamber federal system elected the same way as in America, with senators and representative. But I’ve never heard a German even suggest that Germany somehow isn’t democracy.Germany and the US are not direct democracies, of course, but still systems that take collective decisions by voting: eligible citizens vote for the legislators, the legislature votes for the legislation.Only difference is that the German president doesn’t select the cabinet executive, the prime minister (the majority leader in the US) does.Thank God I live in a real country with a real king so I don’t have to agonize over these things.

“If his sermon was theologically and scripturally correct, then it means the congregation decided they did not like that part of the Bible, so they avoid it and those who preach it.”
And therein lies the problem.   There are today very few Christian Churches that teach exclusively Biblical principals.   This is why you get Gay Church leaders, women preachers and all manor of subversives in Churches.   No. Democracy has no place in Christian Churches.

        Yes, you nailed itChristianity = following the will of GodDemocracy = following the will of the people (in reality, the will of the elite that brainwashes the people)Christianity teaches that our wills can be corrupt (original sin, “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?” Jeremiah 17;9). So we need to follow the will of God lest we self-destruct. Christianity is an absolutist religion: there are goods and there are evils, independent of the opinion of the people.Democracy teaches that anything is good as long as receives the majority of votes. This is a relativistic religion: everybody has his own concept of good and evil and we have to count to decide what is good. As Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges said: “Democracy is an abuse of statistics.”The end of Christianity in Western countries started in the bourgeois revolutions: in the American Revolution and in the French revolution. This was a change of official religion. Yahweh (or Jehovah) was replaced by “We the People” as supreme God, as supreme measure of good and evil. Things were not apparent at first because the American people was deeply Christian in private so the will of the people coincided with the people of God for a while.When the elites managed to corrupt people so their desires were not Christian anymore, democracy validated these corrupt desires and Christianity was doomed in Western countries.This is why it is so difficult for a foreigner like me to understand the adoration the Founding Fathers receive from conservatives Christians. These guys were anti-Christian people and revolutionaries against Christianity, if not in theory (like Jefferson), in practice. They created an anti-Christian political system. They were scoundrels that only wanted power for themselves and denied other people the rights they claimed for themselves (whiskey rebellion).Once I went to a conservative Christian blog and I said that the Founding Fathers were not conservative. It was like saying blasphemy. People reacted with insults and emotionally, as if I had attacked Jesus. I guess childhood indoctrination in Civics class is difficult to get over. In reality, America founded a Satanic system (property-based suffrage and then universal suffrage) over a Christian population. Now the system has ended up swallowing Christianity. It was not a bug: it was a feature.

Instead of “democratic,” I think what you really meant was Jewish-controlled. I don’t see any Christians, practicing or not, running to the courthouse complaining about nativity scenes at city hall. It’s always somebody of Jewish heritage, whether practicing or not.

Maybe this is the way to look at it? Just because the Church is (must be) authoritarian and hierarchical, doesn’t mean that this should translate into the secular world. A related question is whether Christians should embrace theocracy (beyond Vatican and various religious orders).
The Baptists, on the other hand, are severely confused.

            Actually, the entire Reformation can be in a sense considered a demand for “democracy”.  Prior to the Reformation, the people had no voice in the Church except to put up and shut up.  The translation of the Bible into native languages from Latin and the encouragement then for the people to read and decide God’s Will for themselves was truly a democratic process for the time.

                There’s some truth there, but the Reformation would not have happened (at least in the way it did) had the Catholic Church not abused its position as The (self-appointed) Authority. Hard to argue that this organization piling up treasures on earth was doing His will.

                    Definitely.  But the abuse was an excuse (not from Luther, he was a decent God fearing man) for the nobility of the time to seize assets and power from the Catholic Church.  If it wasn’t for the German nobility’s protection, the Pope would have had him burned at the stake in St Peter’s Square to the delight of all.

                        No, the Pope would not have burnt him at the stake. That’s what Protestants tend to do to witches.  I also highly recommend reading some Luther for yourself, particularly late. I’m not so sure Luther was “decent God fearing man”.

                            Think he probably believed himself to be the man of the cloth he wrote that he thought he was. He just thought that several papal decrees, (popes being human, after all) were in error, maybe especially about chastity.

                    Most of those treasures were voluntary gifts from several generations. There were reform movements already underway by the time Germany’s scrupulosity problems exploded over everyone in Northern Europe.The authority comes from Matthew 16, where Jesus appoints Peter the head of his Church in a covenant with a name change. The Catholic Church claims his successor continuously (yes, more or less) though 2000 years of history. You don’t have to believe it, but it’s not self appointed. The record of it is right there in Scripture.

Oh, bullshit! They were “voluntary” in the same sense that income taxes are. The priesthood impressed upon them the dire consequences of not giving “voluntarily”.

I dunno. I’ve always found the maniacal plainness of certain Protestant churches to be much more questionable than elegant cathedrals built and beautified by many successive generations of the diocese.

Perhaps the question is, “Can anything survive in a democracy?”
You put the mob and the fever of its passions above all, and based on what we are seeing, it looks like the lone survivor will be the ashes of everything.

        It is interesting to compare other religions and see if it is Democracy (which entails a whole lot of modern consumerism, atomization, and urban living) or something else.I am not familiar with the retention or loss of faith among  Buddhists, Shintoists, or Hindus. I have seen some data (no expert) on retention, increase, and loss of faith among Muslims. There it is very mixed.Among Muslims in the West, religious feeling and faith increases. But it is NOT NOT NOT interested in converting White people (or blacks) — rather asserting dominance mostly now by stabbing attacks including the one just today in Britain, usually aimed at White children. Dominance or random killings as the Spartans did with their slaves.Among urban centers, Algeria, Tunisia, and the Gulf States and Iran see urbanization and “modernization” have loss of faith, no “democracy” as we would see it there. Turkey too has loss of faith in the urban centers, but retention in rural areas. Egypt, Pakistan, and Iraq, all see an increase not decrease in faith and religious commitment. In that in those places Muslims are willing and able to kill other Muslims over religious doctrines. India too.In urban centers in Malaysia, or Indonesia, it would seem Islam is stable, neither decreasing nor increasing its faith.Interestingly, Muslims view Democracy famously as Erdogan’s street car. Once you reach your destination you get off.I think Christianity in the West is doomed, dead already. The Paris Olympics made a mockery of the Last Supper and no one responded with serious consequences. No one in the West is willing to do serious, violent things to defend the faith the way Muslims are willing to do. Instead most Whites worship the Woke religion of gays, blacks, girl bosses etc if they have any religion at all and see Christianity as equal to cuckdom inevitably if they do not have any religious faith.I think for both Muslims and Christians, their faith is tied up in their racial / ethnic background. Muslim are Muslims not because they have a zeal to create converts for Mohammed’s message, but because it is part and parcel of being Pakistani, Algerian, Egyptian, etc. White people are Christians not because of the Gospel, but because they are White, this is what their ancestors did so too do they worship on Sunday.Bottom line: people don’t live by ideas, ideology, etc. outside of the hothouse of intellectuals. They live by their communal identity or as atomized individuals at the mercy of the fury of the Wokemen.

        Religion, in all its forms, is simply a codification of ancient wisdom and the means to pass on this wisdom to succeeding generations. And wisdom is simply useful knowledge that has stood the test of time and proven itself in the practical aspects of life. As such, you cannot vote new wisdom into existence. Moral authority is an artifact of the success of ancient wisdom in promoting beneficial outcomes within the community it serves. When you follow a path that “works”, both the people and these ideas persist with it. When you forsake this wisdom, you decline, die, or collapse as a society.

        Protestantism was probably doomed from it’s beginnings.  The fundamental premise “every man can read the Bible in his own language and decide what is right” has led to this point…infinite splintering and an al-la carte religious buffet of options.
A formal ecclesiastical hierarchy (Catholics, Orthodox) with specific advancements for advancement/funding/dogma seems to work better.
The Lutherans held out the longest, but ultimately succumbed and may as well be Unitarians or Baptists.
Unfortunate: “parallel institutions” are the only bulwark against the state.

                And you can also interpret it however you like.
Where exactly does it say that “doing what was right in his own eyes” gave bad results? Ruth? Why did He tell Samuel that the Israelites should not have a king if kings were such a great idea? The books of Kings and Chronicles (and Esther) are littered with examples of how doing what was right in the king’s eyes was a disaster. Heck, even David, the best of them, had his friend killed so he could pork his wife.

                Moses also tells the Israelites they should not have kings, as they will send the young men to war (run with the horses) and get killed, and the young women will become concubines. Doesn’t really matter whether this is @TomA’s wisdom of the ancients or revelation, the Book pretty clearly says why kings are a bad idea.

                The Catholic Church indeed seems to be “moving” toward homosexuals and other sorts ofaberrationalbehaviors.  I stopped paying attention after they got to “being a homosexual is OK, but acting upon such impulses is still sinful”.  In other words, come on over—just keep it in your pants.

        Baptists churches, for example, hire their pastors

but trad Catholics also do this. They hunt down priests they think will fit their community. Bishop sandborn has created a whole industry of making priests for trad chapels to hire.

            “We, then, both priests and people, have a right to know whence our pastors have received their power. From whose hand have they received the keys? If their mission comes from the Apostolic See, let us honor and obey them, for they are sent to us by Jesus Christ who has invested them, through Peter, with His own authority. If they claim our obedience without having been sent by the bishop of Rome, we must refuse to receive them for they are not acknowledge by Christ as His ministers. The holy anointing may have conferred on them the sacred character of the episcopate: it matters not; they must be as aliens to us, for they have not been sent, they are not pastors.”The Liturgical Year, Dom Gueranger, Vol IV pg 282-287

            Imo the Catholic church is more democratic than Z is making it out to be, not that this invalidates his larger thesis however.  The Pope for example is elected.  Not by the parishioners, true, whose analog in the democracy are the voters.  But is the US presidential election fundamentally different ?  Superficially, for sure, but at its root?

                        I don’t think these are entirely equivalent. The early US could be described as aristocratic republic, but there was no firm hierarchy and obligations were much looser if any. The Church is organized a lot more like a regular monarchy.

                            The point was that in the early days of the nation, the “nobility” was not a birthright.  You could earn it through hard work and superior ability.  This is along the line of my pleading for “earned suffrage”.  Democracy today requires only that you “fog a mirror”.  That didn’t cut it then and does not today.

                    It isn’t far at all.Under actual existing (especially Our) democracy, the people don’t decide anything. Is there any time in living memory when any Western government hasfollowedpublic opinion? Nothing comes to mind. When the regime doesn’t like the people’s attitude, it changes it—to what “high nobility” have decided it should be, absent our consultation.Democracy isthat, not “mob rule” or “the majority” or whatever. Nothing like the people’s/egalitarian/etc. state conservatives complain about exists anywhere. A government by the people—a state that amplified the people’s attitudes—would be unprecedentedly right-wing.And, of course… The elite phenomenon that the people most reject is homosexual pederasty. “Noble” organizations, those outside the people’s supervision, all embrace it. It’sthesign/celebration of the powerlessness of thedemos.

                        Your discourse above—well reasoned—is precisely why I think the term “democracy” is a term of art. The inventors of such in Athens did have “mob rule”, even when there were only a few eligible citizens who got together in the Pnyx to hear pleas and decide matters of law and punishment. The mob as you will was smaller, but nonetheless unrestrained by reason and often emotional in decision making.

        “Render unto Caesar…”
Two of the three branches of Christianity are what’s left of the Roman Empire imo, and the third is of the people who inherited the West, which makes the question of what’s Caesar’s and what’s God’s complicated. Not meaning to be a smart ass. From the point Romans became Christian, the religion became the vehicle of civilization and empire.

        You have to wonder whether the fact that the names of the days of the week, and many months of the year, were never stripped of their pagan roots was a capitulation of the church to the people.   Because you know there were serious dogmatists over the years who must have been enraged that we were still naming a day after Woden or Odin in English or mercury in Latin.further, at least in Italy, towns and villages would have their patron saints.  It was the will of the people who selected which saint to worship.  Patron saints are a strong tradition of democratic impulse in Catholic society.  And the church couldn’t fight it so capitulated.the church also recognized that it couldn’t standardize everything so gave leeway to different ethnic groups, for example.in fact I’d say the history of the church is the history of a hierarchical system trying to come to terms with the will of the locals and striking a proper balance.  applying authority where need be but providing enough room to roam.  .moral of the story, I think it is misguided to think there could never be democratic aspects to Catholicism.  Only because the real world demands something other than a complete submission to an authority. Even prison wardens realize there is no use fighting the will of the jailbirds in some areas of prison life.

            “You have to wonder whether the fact that the names of the days of the week, and many months of the year, were never stripped of their pagan roots was a capitulation of the church to the people. “Bingo.  The Church in its early years was eager to gain converts, so in many instances simply undertook pagan acts and holidays and made them “Christian”.  They retained Latin month names and “Julian” calendar when in Rome and happily changed the days of the week to Germanic and Celtic names when proselytizingin Northern Europe.  Christmas is dated as a matter of convenience as well.  The general adoption of these holidays and their naming spread then by the Church as their dominance in all affairs rose.Never seemed a problem and even when in grade school, was openly discussed by the Nuns.  When one understands how crude measures of time were in those days, it seemed fine even to young school children (of the time).

        Institutionally, Christianity developed within the context of a monarchical empire. Even after the empire fractured, the Roman Catholic Church functioned in conjunction (though not always in harmony) with the various kings and lords in what was called Christendom. The monarchical order seemed to reflect the divine order, and rulers quickly claimed theocratic sanction for their rule, hence the “divine right” of kings.Protestantism upset the apple cart, and set the stage for democracy. If every conscience could determine the tenets of faith, why not government? The answer, of course, is that individuation ultimately renders both concepts meaningless.Voltaire dismissed the Holy Roman Empire with a quip, but it actually did its fundamental job quite well- keeping the steppe and desert people out of Western Europe. At the same time, the empire preserved the relative independence of its constituent parts, although admittedly at the cost of internal cohesion. Still, it was the original Thousand Year Reich, so they must have done something right.

        Organized Christianity cannot survive Democracy. Disorganized Christianity will always survive democracy (and just about everything else) because its practitioners simply go underground and practice their faith in small groups.The narthex of the church, what people today think of as the lobby or vestibule, once served an important liturgical purpose: it kept nonbelievers out of the worship space, but they could still listen to the proceedings. I’ve also read that in times of persecution, the narthex isolated sounds from within so people could worship in secret.Christians will just erect digital and physical narthexes to separate themselves from nonbelievers.As a cradle Catholic, I’ve struggled mightily to go back to church after covid. The speed with which the Church prostrated itself before bureaucrats was astonishing. I don’t really want to die. Nobody does. But if you believe in what that man nailed to the tree over the altar sacrificed and why, and all the expectations that go with it, then closing the church, requiring appointments for mass, and making people sit 20 feet apart in the sanctuary are completely unnecessary. Yet, they folded like cheap lawn chairs.So, if they don’t really believe in it, why should I go? I’ve barely been to mass a dozen times since 2020.Protestantism has little appeal to me, for much the same reason. I’d just be trading one obedient bureaucracy for another.You can bet that when the media was rabidly hunting Covid-disobedient citizens (too many cars in THAT driveway!) that Christians found ways to practice their faith in secret.

        Now that I think about it, the situation with the pastor reminds me of the situation with Urban Meyer and one of his assistant coaches, Zach Smith. A former butthurt assistant named Tom Herman (who became head coach at Texas) leaked the story that Urban Meyer was covering up for a wife beater on his staff to a sports reporter and the national media ran with it as an example of Me Too. Instead, it turned out to be bad blood between a husband and wife, where the wife needed to be on some bipolar meds.Tom Herman was miffed that Ohio State was recruiting against him in Texas, and usually winning, and tried to sabotage Urban Meyer and Ohio State. Herman’s wife was friends with the former Mrs. Smith and obviously was being fed one-sided information.Could it be that the youth pastor’s wife was miffed that her husband didn’t get the job? I’d say it’s a good bet.

        “Baptist” almost always misunderstood — they are mostly anarchic. However a local congregation rules itself is fine. The SBC meets to decide whether a given congregation is sufficiently “Christian” to be a member of the club. I’d expect that particular church will be given the boot.
The one my son attends just redid their ConBy, and by their new rules, anything even tangentially connected to the faith is decided by the elders. The congregational meetings are mostly to inform them of the decisions that have been made.

            From what I’ve seen the past couple of years the SBC is pretty much pozzed in a lot of respects. There is a constant struggle to purge the bad but at best it’s a draw. I’m not a SBC or anything, just an interested observer because there are so many SBC churches around me.

        In thinking over this, I’m reminded of the Boy Scouts and derby cars.
I would say the church in an analogous sense defines the weight and the type of wood that must be used in all derby cars.  But then the individual can use his imagination and make any car he wants from that stock material.  Similar to old stock car racing too
its a central authority passing down rules but allows for some individualism at the ground level,  this seems to be the only way to actually govern in the real world.

            I liked this essay. As many I was educated in a Catholic school that took Democracy for granted. The sacred belief is that democracy=’peace and justice for all’ and then overthrowing it is mustache-painter/fascist thinking. Liberte-Egalite-Fraternite is fake.Democracy is appealing for the libertarian/white European mind but it does not work in a multicultural society on the long run. A homogeneous society will enshrine some religious beliefs and make them taboo for the “democracy” in place.It is provocative. I think this is the correct approach, we have to stop taking everything we learned as given and question things using the principle that everything you learned in school was propaganda. As this moment the gist of the whole XX century history I learned in school I estimate as fake. If you add the principle to go back to the French revolution time then democracy is up for review.I have the cheat sheet of the people that came before me so I know the answer. Democracy is fake and gay (our-democracy-TM). Only a diluted version works in a culturally and ethnically homogeneous society where people agree on the basic morals so they are enforced by taboos and the official church (many constitutions had an official church, the Catholic, in Latin America for example).On the other hand our-democracy-tm will be always used to impose communist ideas on the population. Communism is anti-Christian by definition so democracy=’no Christianity allowed’. F your family and your principles to protect the ‘rights’ of parasites and sexual deviants that want to groom your kids. To what I say, F democracy and homeschool your kids!

        The solution of course is limited government. A government that is constitutionally limited in how it interferes in and regulate private human activity will, by definition, protect the right of Christians to live by their religious tenets.The reason why we even have a problem today with this is because the Christian right did not accept this approach to the issue of same sex marriage, among others. Rather than working to get the government out of the marriage business, they instead tried to use the court system to prevent same sex marriage using religious arguments. Because the court can only use objective legalistic criteria to decide cases, of course the religious right lost this case and we got same sex marriage nationwide in 2015, thus setting up the cascade of woke leftism that started from then.This all could have been avoided if the religious right had supported efforts to simply get the government out of the marriage business and by extension, get the government out of regulating our personal lives in general. They did not do this. I think the reason is that they were filled with the same hubris as the Bush II administration with its war on terror. As a result, they lost everything.

            they instead tried to use the court system to prevent same sex marriage using religious arguments.You have this pretty much bass-ackwards.  They used democracy to shoot down heauxmeaux marriage, and had a very solid track record (40-1 or something).  The heauxmeauxes then turned to the courts to undo democracy, which in a sense, is why the courts exist.Even if they used purely secular arguments (and there are some good ones), the courts were in the mood tolaissezles bon temps rouler.Of course, the courts are human (maybe lizard) institutions and therefore get a lot of shit wrong, but there it is.

                A little bit of history because you are not getting it.Prop 8, banning same sex marriage in CA, was passed in 2008. Liberals challenged this in the federal district court. The judge took the case seriously because he knew it was going to be very big deal. He specifically asked the attorney representing the religious factions to present specific evidence that allowing same sex marriage would change the way straight people treated marriage and that the effect had to be causative. The attorney was unable to do that. in fact, the story I heard was that he walked out of the courtroom when asked to present such evidence. This is how the religious factions lost the CA case. Rather than leaving it at that, the religious factions involved were the party that escalated the case to the Supreme Court, which they ended up loosing.There were two major arguments advanced by the religious right in opposition to same sex marriage. The first was that allowing same sex marriage would by some undefined social mechanism cause straight people to treat marriage differently than they otherwise would. The other was that the legalization of same sex marriage, particularly on the federal level, would result in more aggressive attacks on religious institutions on the part of the left. Of these two issues, it was the first of these that was most often cited by the religious right as opposition to same sex marriage.This first argument turned out to be bogus, of course. But the second turned out to be very real. This is now what religious people are grappling with today. It is not only my opinion, but that of the more sober-minded Christian right people (Rod Dreher, along others) that resulted in this threat against religious institutions. If the case had not been escalated to SCOTUS, the issue would have been resolved on the state level, blue states allowing it and red state not. This would have prevented the assault on religious institutions by leftists on the federal level.

                    The first argument was not bogus. Everywhere that homo marriage has been legalized, heterosexual shacking up has increased, and heterosexual marriage has decreased. But even with that as an established fact (which it probably wasn’t at that time), it’s still difficult to explain why, especially in a legal sense.

                        Marriage has been declining among straight people since the 1970’s. There is no evidence that same sex marriage has had any causative effect on the rate of decline.

                    Your explanation is well made, but I’m not a big fan of “activist” judges who direct from the bench just what evidence they will consider in rendering a verdict.We’ve seen this in AZ in recent trials wrt voter fraud in the last two election cycles.  In one case, an unexamined and uncounted box of several thousand ballots was discovered.  The County was sued to open the box and count/examine the ballots.  The judge said two things needed to be shown first, 1) the count would change election results, and 2) the box had been deliberately excluded—rather than simple incompetence on the part of election officials, before he would authorize the box being opened and ballots examined/counted—even though all parties admitted these were uncounted ballots.In short, the standard of evidence was raised by a single judge beyond that stated in published law.  The case went away.  The case btw was not to simply change results, but to create evidence of election corruption leading to a redo of the election through legal recourse.  In short, the judge repressed examination of such evidence.

        At a conference so I missed the boat on this one a bit. Others have focused on this issue, but I will repeat: the issue here is not so much democracy; it is taking women seriously.
Theodore Beale (aka Vox Day) writes periodically on the topic of the destruction women cause in a church. He’s spot-on when it comes to this topic.

        “Catholicism, for example, is anti-democratic in structure, but American Catholics love democracy.”Astute observation here. The issue is that American Catholics are far more influenced by the culture around them then they realize. Our media assume “Our democracy”. Public schools do, so now also Catholic schools do. Catholics watch the same pundits and TV as Protestants.It’s about pop culture infecting the common culture of American Catholicism. It also spills out into the “litgury wars”. It’s fought mostly online, but people believing they are uber Catholics for saying terrible things about Pope Francis. They try to decide on doctrine and practice for themselves while driving hours to go to “right” Mass. It’s Protestant church shopping, again a habit entirely picked up from American Protestant culture.There is no particular cure for it, unfortunately. As the secular American culture decays, I’m hopeful that American Catholic culture begins to right itself again.That said, if I find a committed monarchist, it’s about 50/50 they’ll be a practicing Catholic, too.

        I’m an atheist but not a “materialist” in the metaphysical sense. Metaphysically, if you will, I’m a Taoist/Zen Buddhist, have been for more than fifty years (I´m 78) and when my time is up, I’d like to go out per the lyrics of this tune:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFGs7HP15d4.I don´t know whether the lyricist or the singers are Catholic or Taoist or Zen Buddhists, but I´m inclined to doubt it. That said: So what? The Christian moral and ethical order has been subverted, but it is the foundational moral and ethical order of the USA and the rest of the West and should remain so in my humble opinion, in spite of the opinions of the other two ” Abrahamic” religions, both essentially alien to the order of the West. Nevertheless, it appears the first to call out the utter degeneracy and challenge displayed in the opening spectacle of the Paris Olympics was IRAN! Good for them!Those of you who are Christians of any stripe should know by now just who their enemies truly are and act accordingly. “Democracy”? According to whose definition of the word/concept?

        Seems to me that Christians have coexisted for centuries in democratic nations. The English approached the question in a very interesting way King Henry just made himself the head of the church and the state and POOF! Everything was just peachy.

            Well, as I understand it, the situation was a bit more complex.  Up to that time in England, the Church and the King were at odds in the realm of secular power.  The church also rivaled the King in wealth.  Something had to give and the Reformation was a pretty good excuse.  Henry basically grabbed the church assets. Whereas up to that time he did well enough with the Catholic Church.  Afterwards, there was quite a long time of power struggle between Protestants and Catholics and lots of blood shed even after Henry died.  Too lazy to look up when Catholic restrictions were lightened up, but it must have been a century or more.

                No, there was widespread contempt for the catholic church animated as it was by southern European chauvinism. The Tudors had won the War of the Roses recently and were still dealing with the aftermath. By denying Henry the right to divorce the catholic church was trying to pitch England ,a christian country ,back into a civil war to benefit Charles V.. Disgraceful.
Throughout its history the catholic church has waged war against northern European countries which is why the north largely went Protestant because it was quite clear Christianity was not the organising principle of the catholic church,

                    No argument wrt Catholic Church corruption, but the nobility in Protestant countries were quite happy to seize Church assets, as was Henry.  Henry had no “right” to a divorce.  Annulment, possibly, if we leave “right” out.But yes, the Pope was less than happy with Henry’s desire for a male heir via divorce (and other means).  I yield to your knowledge in this matter.I’ve often wondered what we’d find out today if we did a bit of disintering and some DNS analysis.  Do we really think that all those heirs were sired by the king after he got rid of his supposedly “barren” wife?

        i say yes, with conditions, Christianity is compatible with democracy.   there must be some moral code of conduct within the democracy, with men and women who strictly judge according to the moral code of man. in America the moral code is recognizing god as the creator of all things who has passed down wisdom to create the constitution, bill of rights, declaration of independence and the bible.while america has a great history of following the moral code, now a days not so much.  much of the population has turned away from the moral code.  many judges lack the strict adherence to moral code and even relish their own lack of integrity.  a large portion of the population in america has become self indulgent with little respect for one another.where much is given much is required.  sure we all want to live in a civil society with clean water, plenty of food, and beautiful shelter.  are we willing to live by the moral code?  sorry, cannot have large parts of the population be self indulgent and have a civil society.  self indulgence will ultimately lead to destruction.yes, scripture is the word of god.  what is scripture to you?  scripture simply put is gods wisdom given to each of us.  we must try to understand the wisdom and apply it to our daily lives.  sharing gods wisdom, ensuring a society based on moral code.  the idea is not so much sharing religion, but sharing wisdom.  gods wisdom ensures civility.the test.  will todays leaders pass for men/women who live by gods wisdom?   sadly, i say not.

        This essay is extraordinarily confused, which is fairly typical of Z-Man whenever he gets to talking about religious, ethical, philosophical, political, or other topics that require you to use words according to their—you know—definitions.While it’s sure to garner a lot of opinionated comments, it’s a safe bet that most of those, like the essay itself, are going to miss the point.The fact that the tenets of Christianity are not revised by majority rule does not, in and of itself, place it in the category of “antidemocratic” when it runs counter to the popular will, any more than Christianity would be anti-monarchial when it resists the will of an errant king. Heresy and evil come in many forms: democratic, autocratic, imperial, plutocratic, oligarchic, and even ecclesiastic. When the Church opposes an evil, it does not thereby commit itself to being anti-[whatever organizational form the evil took]. If that were the case, then the Church would be anti-everything. This is just plain, categorical nonsense.There are plenty of good reasons to be generally opposed to democratic rule (and I am). However, the Church is perfectly able to accommodate itself to democratic institutions, if that is the form that society has already taken. This is, of course, an entirely separate question from whether or not the Church on Earth isitselfa democracy. It emphatically is not. The Church is a monarchy with Christ as its head, and that can never change.But to argue in the manner above, and to aver that Christianity must oppose political democracy wherever it finds it, is to unwittingly place democracy into the same metaphysical category of the Church, i.e. to make a creed out of the democratic system. This is the province of those who were once true believers in that creed and were bitten by it. It is not the reaction of those who see democracy for what it is: a late and degenerate system of voting, a poor form of government, but a passing and earthly thing all the same.

                    As usual, you make an (gratuitous) assertion without elaboration.  Would you care to elaborate on how your quoted segment is not and could not logically be considered as insulting and belittling to the audience here?
Then I’m certain some other astute, regular, commentators will be happy to post other examples of your previous posts here and on UNZ where you have commented derogatory upon Z-man and his audience.
The definition I use:  “…is a rhetorical strategy where someone attacks their opponent’s character or personal traits…”, and I illustrated exactly where my interpretation stems from in your posting.

                    The point being that you might find a more receptive audience here if you simply managed to disagree less disagreeably. You’re a smart guy who has interesting things to say–even though I disagree with many of them. It’s a minor shame you seem disinclined to stowe the snark when posting your animadversions.

                        Ostei. I disagree with your comment “…smart guy…”. Nothing could be further from the truth.My definition of a smart guy is one who posts more than gratuitous assertions regarding the matter at hand. Pejoratives are not replacements for wisdom, fact, or knowledge.  ID posts for himself.  His standard “word salad” is simply to impress others, but most importantly himself.A “smart guy” teaches as well as expounds. Yes, we all post assertions—or opinion—on this blog, but most everyone has earned some modicum of respect over time and certainly few, if any, have repeatedly posted commentary that decries our commentators’ and blog host’s intelligence and good intent.Certainly, ID’s postings have been in the past ponderous to the extreme. He could at least spend a line or two specifically upon that which he finds incorrect in his mind wrt any particular topic. Thus educating the benighted masses who post here. ID has been called to produce such numerous times, but—troll-like—fails to respond to the challenge.Opinion is one thing, but after umpteenth challenge to cite references, corroborating fact, or for clarification, one suspects an “empty vessel” is being spoken to. To which point, I can only say that Z-man, in response one of ID’s early comments, summed up the situation quite eloquently when he said, “ID…has the knowledge of a college freshman who has finished a first year survey course on the topic…”I see no growth in ID’s commentary since then. He is an annoyance to read at best and I try to move on as quickly as I can scroll, but as I don’t read line by line, but paragraph by paragraph, a simple glance at ID’s first lines is immediate. Today’s first paragraph was typical ID, insult the reader for being stupid and confused, then pontificate to the benighted.ID has no gravitas. He is a failed blogger, a failed video publisher on his YT channeland seems not well received at his old home as resident troll on the Unz Review.  He has never been able to generate an audience for his views on his own. He depends upon his betters to produce an audience for his commentary. So do I to an extent, but I try never to bit the hand that feeds me.His first posting to this group was absurd (IIRC). If I remember, he proposed a “solution” to our (White) racial problem—every White person should marry a POC. That was the start of his antagonism within this group. He has not improved, albeit his preposterously long postings seem to have shrunk to a more normal—if not less annoying—size. I can only hope that’s not due to him plaguing some other blog site with his insights and wisdom.

            Christ is not at the head of the church, the Pope is.  Christ essentially deputized the Pope to act on His behalf .that quibble aside, you seem to be conflating the church “on paper” with the church in practice where not all of its many tentacles reach fully into the local parish.  And when the priest or bishop as the case may be gets too far out of line, there are procedures to excommunicate him, but this seems to be done with some reluctance from Rome.yes it’s a hierarchy, monarchical in some ways, but even kings had to delegate authority.  Again, on paper the king is the absolute ruler, but not in practice. And practice is an important part of the discussion.

                “Christ essentially deputized the Pope to act on His behalf”At risk of the whole millstone thing, (you seem sufficiently “based” that you can consider opposing views without losing your faith) how exactly did He do that? Was it in the part about “call no man Father” or “call no man teacher/rabbi”, or the part about building a church on the man who not more than a few sentences earlier had told, “Get thee behind me Satan!”Or is your faith that he deputized the pope simply that the pope said so? A pope whose job depended on you accepting that? How could I know that pope wasn’t pulling a Fauci?

            I don’t think Z was saying that Christianity has needs be opposed to democracy because political systems fall within Christianity’s creedal ambit. Rather, he was suggesting that the political atmosphere of democracy seems to suffuse the church and poison its members, leading them to the false, anti-Christian notion that Christianity’s very structure must be converted to a democracy, i.e. that the church must mimic the secular government. And if that indeed is his point, I think he’s got a pretty good case.

            “the Church is perfectly able to accommodate itself to democratic institutions, if that is the form that society has already taken.”
Indeed. And so, finally, the Pope is no longer Catholic.
