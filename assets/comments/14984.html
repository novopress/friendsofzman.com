        They have pulled the roof down on themselves, Z. What happens to us is still up in the air. My family has been led and dominated by hormonal females for most of my 54 years on this planet. About 5 years ago I walked away and my wife came with me; contrary to the hormonal men of the manosphere‚Ä¶ no, Not All Women Are Like That. It‚Äôs time for a divorce. What that will look like remains to be seen.
I see cats and kitty litter and lonliness for a lot of women in the days ahead.

        Cult is a fairly good model for the typical low-info shitlib, but one mustn‚Äôt forget that the entire apparatus of the state is oriented toward propping up their fantasies. The effect is still so powerful that even a majority of people who nominally oppose them (‚Äúconservatives‚Äù) still believe most of the same things.
I prefer to think of it as a full-blown religion, and the U.S. and most of western society today as a theocracy. They may not have God, but that‚Äôs merely a Calvinist twist ‚Äì an evolutionary adaptation for democracy.

            The NRx types like to think of this religion as being an outgrowth of calvinism. But this social justice religion is more like hinduism.

                Calvinism started out as the religion of wealthy merchants. They haven‚Äôt changed one iota. They believe that God displays his grace upon the True Believer by granting them financial success. Make money and it is a sign of your being ‚Äúsaved‚Äù. Walk over your neighbors to achieve wealth and all is fine, because it is a sign.

                I point to Calvinists because they‚Äôre probably the earliest and most obvious social justice offshoot, but progressivism is a coalition of all antinomian branches, including Quakers and Episcopalians ‚Äì and of course, reform Jews.
I‚Äôm no expert on Hinduism, although from what little I know, it‚Äôs hard to see the correlation. On the other hand, if you go to the wiki entry for ‚ÄúMainline Protestant‚Äù, you can practically tick off all the liberal/progressive boxes one by one.

There is a govenor on your thinking about the future where they are in control and nutty as well.
Their hostility and aggravated abuse of power would result in civil conflict.

        We needed a Carter to get President Reagan. Just like we needed an Obama to get President Trump.
Here‚Äôs hoping the left keeps up the lunacy and they get slaughtered with the midterm elections. Hiawatha is getting challenged by a young Republican.  It‚Äôs Massachusetts so all the lefties assume she‚Äôs guaranteed to get reelected.
Should she goes down in flames this fall that would be a telling bellwether that the dirt people are still upset and will continue to throw the bums out.

        Politics as a cult is common in Latin America, Africa and Muslim nations. It is our future. We are importing the people who will join the cult that too many heritage don‚Äôt want to join and we have turned over the educational system to the cult to insure that the young have a great chance of being indoctrinated into the cult.

        Insane yes, but not benign like the Seekers mania. The Progressive Sect seeks power for the purpose of dominating the sane and ensuring their primacy, control, and sustenance. This is not a joking matter (e.g. look over there at the crazy people, aren‚Äôt they acting funny). This is a deadly serious threat to liberty loving citizens trying to live normal lives. And this threat won‚Äôt evaporate in November regardless of the outcome.

        Just a site-related comment. I read every word of every post, but recently the mobile version has become eye-killingly small. Hard to read. Any remedy for that?
Also, the comments have gone wacky, with the upvotes disappearing and the comments box moving to the bottom. The old way was better.
Just constructive suggestions from a fan. Thanks. Soldier on, Zman!

        Thinking back, Billy Boy Clinton just wanted a ton of money and lots of easy tail out of his presidency, Boosh Jr. wanted to get out of it in one piece (9/11 was not what he had signed up for), and Obama wanted to LARP as some sort of African strongman (but didn‚Äôt quite have the firepower to go over the top of the hill with it).  Hillary, however, seems to have this weird Jim Jones-type need to cultivate a string of followers and lead them around.  It‚Äôs like some sort of bizarre parenting thing gone haywire.  It‚Äôs not where she might want to take the followers, or what she stands for (there is ample evidence she will say or do anything at any particular moment, if that is what is expected of her from her followers, or might get her out of hot water with the rest of us).  The point is that they follow her, like ducklings to a mother duck, that seems to be what matters to her.  And when she leads them off the cliff, all that matters to her that they go off the cliff with her.  That‚Äôs what she seems to be about.  Allowing such a person anywhere close to the levers of power is absolutely insane.  It is also another element of Leftist projection attributed to Trump.  Deep down, the Lefties know what she is about, and they like to project it to DJT.

        The Cult is going to go from one thing to another, week by week, and then, in six years or so, Trump will hand the presidential baton to someone else.  The Cultists will be dancing in the streets and passing out sweets for a day or two.  And then, they are going to feel like the kids do when Christmas is over.  They will have lost the talismanic symbol of their rage.  A big empty place where their hate used to live.  And then things will get really weird on their side of the fence.  I am hoping for their self-immolation without taking us down.  It would be the best for all concerned.  They would get what they want, and we would get what we want.  One can hope.

        The left is making strategic error after strategic error. The main reason they have been historically successful has been because the fuzzy middle accepted their premises and acquiesced to their demands occasionally while never reversing any of their successes.While the fuzzy middle seemed to be willing to go along with attempts to undermine the transfer of power after the last election, the utter craziness of their behavior recently is threatening the alliance. I just got a call yesterday from someone who had been refusing to speak to me after the election. I think part of this was precipitated by his witnessing of the above, and deciding that I was not the crazy Nazi his friends were saying I was (I think maybe I am, but that is not the point here). This is probably due to Trump resetting for many people what the parameters of normal is in relation to all the craziness.

        That‚Äôs the fundamental crisis of legitimacy right there ‚Äî our leaders are insane.  Whatever else it‚Äôs supposed to do, representative government is supposed to prevent *that*.  We can tolerate some eccentricities in our rulers ‚Äî who among us isn‚Äôt a little quirky? ‚Äî but the stuff our ‚Äúleaders‚Äù in the Uniparty believe is outright barking lunacy.  Any system that puts someone like Kamala Harris within three zip codes of the levers of power is broken beyond all hope of repair.

            Yes our leaders are nuts and worse have been for some time. What makes it different now is that Trump‚Äôs winning the presidency exposed them as the lunatic cultists they are.
And Harris is a loon.. But look at those senile hags, Feinstein and Pelosi who are both mentally unfit to hold office. Or gropin Joe Biden, looney tunes Schiff, mad dog Ellison and carnival barker Booker.
Any system that protects such denizens of the Imperial Capital is indeed beyond repair.  For it‚Äôs one thing to promote scoundrels and bland machine pols. But not the aforementioned mental menials.

        Very droll, but have you considered that YOU may in fact be the Seekers in this matter, falling victim to confirmation bias as you survey the landscape of pre 1980s ‚Äúwhite america‚Äù, a dreary landscape of mediocrity and corruption.  ALL societal markers have improved dramatically after the civil rights acts and the 1965 hart cellar act, opening the American dream to the talented masses held back in the trap of colonialism.  You choke back recognition that dr Carson can clip an aneurysm with greater pizzazz than the best of you, and the corollary that he has better claim to your women!  Spread the good genes I say!

                @SES:Do I read you correctly that the reason our country‚Äôs young military aged males and child bearing age females are using and killing themselves with drugs is that there is a lack of opportunities and a sense of hopelessness of the future so they turn to using drugs to escape?Also, may I ask if you are referring to young rural white people (who have been the target of much of this ‚Äúwhite privlidge‚Äù non-sense)? Or if you are instead / also referring to urban blacks instead (who have the same or greater limited opportunities and sense of hopelessness as well?

            Hilarious. Which societal markers? Be specific, and don‚Äôt cherry-pick your time frame ‚Äì you need to go back to at least the early 20th century.
Some markers that definitely haven‚Äôt gotten better include: urban crime, unemployment, family formation, fertility, obesity, fatherlessness (especially among blacks), drug/alcohol abuse, mental health, taxation level and entrepreneurship.
But I‚Äôm sure those markers are all relics of the dreary and corrupt past. So go on, tell us which markers matter, don‚Äôt sputter about weak generalities like a pathetic gamma.

        This is complicated to write coherently. Pardon me on that please. A lot of days I think TINVOWOOT, (there is no voting our way out of this).There are a couple ways to interpret that, one is that is as it should be, people become manifest in the face of wonton corruption and itinerant tyranny.The other is its combat humor, gallows humor, etc. Which really, TINVOWOOT is an observation, snark, that in reality it doesn‚Äôt matter if TINVOWOOT or not, what matters is resistance is fertile, and live free or die. Of course its the timeless glass half empty verses the half full glass crowd. Then there‚Äôs the resistance is futile chicken littles, ideology and cargo cult/useful idiot trolls, State agent provocateurs, the whole lot of quitters loosers traitors what have you. Plus the advent of the Trump deranged. But these detractors and shit stirrers dont matter in the larger context when things turn kinetic. Lot of everything changes in ways most demographics are unawares of and ill prepared. Just as there‚Äôs not a lot of athiests in fox holes during a TOT artillery barrage. Whats ‚ÄúComing Down The Pike‚Äù is a dandy of a black swan on unknown unknowns.Mainly, Voting was not invented to help us vote our way of unmitigated disasters of government, it was there so we would never in the first instance have to vote our way out of anything remotely an issue other means, like our inalienable right to weapons, would be required for.Be all that as it may, as they are my personal observations, for what that is worth, long as there is voting, if we are to get out of the pickle we are in, every resource is invaluable, and combined add up quickly as the sovereign state of the dirt people possesses legitimacy that no other actor or entity in this pickle has or can ever acquire.For right now, as it is proof positive the orange revolution of 11-8-16 proves beyond any doubt, voting works very well when you have an audacious motivated plurality of 65 Million who participate, and you are such a dirt people plurality of numbers which cancels out the tactical margin of built in vote fraud/gerrymander the left lives and dies by.Fort example, if you ever noticed, since the first POTUS election AD Ronny Raygun, most contests have been won by that approx 3% margin in vote percentages. I do believe, 3% is about the practical limit of vote fraud under present political circumstances, due to the costs, man power, margin of felonious actions which can be kept below the radar, and the method of gerrymander employed, like key precincts or counties in battle ground state go 100% for the next anointed regime leader. No county or precinct truthfully votes 100% for one candidate except in a one in a billion outliers. If even that.The cabal is in a serious pickle. The cats out of the bag on vote rigging and gerrymandering tactics. Like treason, none dare call it treason, but everyone knows its there, so it is with the cabals vote rig, so lets say they can manage an effective 1.5% ‚Äì 2% vote fraud in the mid terms over all on races that are critical. There‚Äôs that, but they now have to factor in unknown unknowns in regards to the dirt people‚Äôs motive power, and its audacity to defy the expected results of the dirty stinking commies and its corrupt cabals agenda over decades to genocide the values precepts and moral of the dirt people, these dirt people have the gall to openly revolt against the marxian Former United States of Amerika? This is an entirely unexpected ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù turn of events. If these Deplorable‚Äôs beat the total fix of 2016, what is going to happen in midterm 2018?I honestly think they don‚Äôt know. They cant predict or factor in any critical data into their marxist social engineering formula‚Äôs, because they don‚Äôt understand dirt people. Too busy trying to genocide us dirt people and our culture. Ideological crippling cognitive dissonance. Blinds them from understanding dirt people, instead, hate and envy, as the ultimate bigots motives, undermines their ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù, Its their soft underbelly, their big weakness, their Achilles‚Äô heel.TINVOWOOT, but there is winning against the sonofabitches in the public flea circus of voting who gets in, who goes, who to stay or leave The Swamp. And a political defeat after the POYUS election ass pounding they got, will destroy the cabal‚Äôs political machine as we know it in ways we cant imagine. Us dirt people pull another rabbit out our arse‚Äôs like we did with Mr. Trump, the effects of our weaponization of withdrawal of our Consent, (see all‚Äôs fair in love &amp; war, and politics), will be devastating.The way the left is behaving, i‚Äôll bet a lot on they are not only frantic, they have lost control of the margin of vote fraud and gerrymander they have enjoyed for what? Since their war of northern aggression? A continuous unbroken line of gerrymandering treason against the will of us dirt people right up to today.

                Good job, calsdad, definitive even. But I‚Äôve been on this same band wagon for years, to no noticeable effect.That error is pervasive across the interwebz, along with many another. I share your ire and despair.However‚Ä¶ Doug is one of the Really Good Guys who it has been my pleasure to witness develop in thinking and writing (mostly at WRSA) for several years, and with whom I agree more than not.If you would hang him, you‚Äôll have to start with me.We have not enough articulate, thoughtful and courageous men on our side to dismiss out of hand for mere grammatical errors.Doug, good on ya for all you write and do, as I know how you live and believe‚Ä¶ but please do get the diff between lose and loose.

                        LOLMy overall point is that there is a certain subset of people who will just dismiss a well thought out argument simply because of one word mis-spelling.You shouldn‚Äôt have to cater to them,  but people should use the language correctly too.When I see people write things like ‚Äù if we don‚Äôt do X ‚Äì we‚Äôre going to loose!!‚Äù  ‚Äì I respond with:‚Äù loose what ‚Äì a fart?  One of those trendy burning lunch bags?  What are we letting loose?‚ÄùRepeat for effect:  Commies love language destruction , because it instills a lack of mental discipline.  Stop doing their job for them.

                Depending on when he grew up he may be forgiven this faux pas as the focus on ‚Äòhard‚Äô education started losing traction in the early 70‚Äôs. Remember also that spell check and grammar check have their limitations.I do however see your point as to how both the language and definition of words has be co-opted to ‚Äòsteer‚Äô those with a public indoctrination center (schools) education towards socialism and other things of political value to the left.The best way to overcome this handicap is to READ A LOT of quality literature and learn the use of the English language that way.  It worked for me and I got straight D‚Äôs in English all through high school.When I write I do proof read, several times and still miss things upon occasion.  Check, double check, re-check and then czech üôÇ again.

            I‚Äôm not convinced that shooting them is a good idea.  It would not have enough ‚Äòvisibility‚Äô for the most part as much of it would be out of the public view.  A better solution?  Well‚Ä¶..let‚Äôs just say that there is no shortage of rope and street lamps in this country both of which would be highly visible and a warning to would be tyrants.

            I wouldn‚Äôt dismiss the left so lightly with regards to killing us. One thing they have down cold that right does not is the ability to organize and organize at a moments notice. Right now when they don‚Äôt get their way it‚Äôs professionally made signs, transportation on demand and paid-for legal services on call 24/7, that takes organization, and more importantly, money. Who wants to wager that they already have caches of AK‚Äôs &amp; RPG‚Äôs stashed away all over the country, as well as lists of who they should be looking for first once they get the proverbial green light?

                I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they had weapons caches. Nothing much surprises me these days. But what they don‚Äôt have is training. Sure, it doesn‚Äôt require a whole lot of practice and skill to fire wildly into a crowd of people, but you can‚Äôt get away with that for long. Sure, it would kill a good number of people, but after that initial shocking event, it wold be game on. And there really isn‚Äôt any substitute for real training and practice. Muscle memory. Can you reload or clear a jam in the dark while your hands are sweaty. Even just doing it liek that with someone yelling at you adds another level of stress to it. How many of them have done any of that? Im guessing not very many. A hell of a lot less than we have on our side. Being fit, and knowing how to use a firearm properly, are both lifestyle choices. You have to devote a considerable amount of time and money to it.For a hypothetical, lets say they do have these weapons caches. How many of them do you think could pick up an AK, load rounds into the magazine the right way, lock it into the weapon, chamber a round, and then fire it. Then keep firing it, as loud as it is, without dropping it and running away. Take a look around your local starbucks and see which of those soy boy hipsters look like they can do that. Or look at lefty twitter and take a guess.I‚Äôm not saying all this to completely discount the left and say they aren‚Äôt dangerous. They are. I just mean that it takes a lot more than simply getting a gun put into your hands to make you effective. There are 10s of millions of people who DO have guns that they are very proficient with and have received actual training in their use. I‚Äôd bet that 90% of them fall into either A- firmly on the right, or B- do not want to anything to do with any of this shit and won‚Äôt be participating unless they absolutely have to.

                    The soy-boys won‚Äôt be the ones doing the shooting.  It will be criminal street gangs and Antifa types.  They only need III percent of their population, (with apologies to Mike Vanderboegh.)  How many Germans were active Nazis in 1932?  How many Russians were Bolsheviks in 1917?

                    Oh without a doubt, I understand what you‚Äôre saying and yes. most of the population of the local Starbucks would shit their collective pants when faced with someone who not only knew how to use a weapon properly, but had a number of notches on their belt from situations in the real world.A few months ago there was an AntiFa training video going around the web of a bunch of them at an improvised range with their AK‚Äôs. Most of the comments concerned making fun of them and the fact that their hits were all over the map. Then one commenter pointed out that there was a guy walking up and down the line (Dressed like a gray man, if there ever was one) giving everyone there pointers on how to close up their groups, how to properly hold their weapons, stuff like that. This commenter asked, ‚ÄúWho is that guy? Who‚Äôs paying him and where did he get his training? It‚Äôs obvious he knows what he‚Äôs doing, why is he there?‚ÄùSo while most of the AniFa goons are just drug-addled losers who have no direction, there does exist in their ranks a core of people who do have some decent training. Sometimes, that‚Äôs all it takes.

        As someone who has written and been published in various alt-right ezines, I am driven to distraction to find grammatical and spelling errors in an otherwise elucidating essay. The Z Man is always interesting because of his Innovative slant on current events. But there are at least 7 grammatical and spelling errors in his current piece. I attribute this to his lacking an editor to review his essays. I know that some commenters have offered to edit his pieces free of charge. One commenter said that when there is an obvious error it tends to diminish the importance of the topic in the reader‚Äôs mind. This is right on point. I do wish The Z Man would take more pain to edit his work . . .nevertheless, I will still read his essays and appreciate his talent.
