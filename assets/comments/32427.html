        Lately it feels like I’m losing IQ points every time I l get on the internet. I dread 3 more months of it. Presently I regret not investing in an off grid survivalist cabin. Not to escape the apocalypse, that doesn’t scare me, but to escape the mind numbing bullshit of this presidential campaign.

            The “news” now is just a hall of mirrors, nothing is true, nothing is connected to everyday issues such as inflation or public safety, or broader issues such as inmivasion, the threat of war, cultural decay, the loss of civil liberty and the rule of law. There is no room left for clear thinking on any topic whatsoever, at a time when disaster beckons for everyone, not just normal people. Widespread confusion about everything invites first menticide, then suicide. And that appears to be the goal of tptb.Anyway, I am with you. It’s not just the major media either; I am weary of my normiecon friends forwarding memes to me that “own the libs”. Half a dozen times a day my attention is broken by some meme or link to which I either reply with an LOL emoji or maybe with some reply like “Dude, sick burn!” Three more months of all this? Ninety days of soul-destroying inanity in all directions as the world turns to shit?

                    Actually, good timing mentioning that. Thanks. Needed something to listen to while cycling on the rollers in the evening – too hot in the day time, plus too  old to take the heat like that or see well at night, it sucks. Come to think of it, I think that album sucked too, but I haven’t popped it in in years. Hopefully misremembering.

            After I turned off the news I don’t know how many years ago and stopped listening to talk radio, I haven’t missed a thing. I get what I need from these comment sections. I wish I could get back into the habit of reading the Wall Street Journal. I used to read it voraciously, and then at some point I lost interest. I’m sure they would also piss me off.

                    Depends perhaps on how you listen.  Since I work outside or exercise outside, I have headphones on.  Since these guys just repeat the same old thing hour after hour, I play games and look to see just how illogical their rants are or how they can lambast the Lefties for their hypocrisy while reciting their own for their audience.  When one no longer can take it and even such analysis becomes boring, I switch to FM music.Prager is the best, but I’m always a sucker for analyzing events in terms of Biblical morality, but even Prager misses the mark lately with his unquestioning support of Israel and the war over there.  He is however quite good on all the tranny stuff we are inundated with.

                What makes these times particularly difficult to endure is not knowing when the sword of Damocles is going to drop. So you prepare as best you can. Get in shape, buy more ammo, meds, non-perishable food, gold, silver, cash, gasoline, diesel, shortwave radio, TP, toothpaste, music, family photos, whiskey, books…there’s no end to it. Then you wake up the next morning, read the news headlines and go out and buy some more garden tools.

                We are in the sticks too – and yet, amazingly enough, have fiber optic 3 miles off the paved  road.  Friends on the paved road just a tad south of us don’t have it – never will understand the vagaries of these programs but immensely grateful, as husband must have reliable internet to work.

Bear in mind most MSM stories are written by people operating at the grade school level.
Their audience is at the nursery dchool level.

            If you’re serious, Jeff… it’s called the ‘OFF’ button. But sticking your head in the sand is not the way of the dissident, and thank goodness for that!
Keep your head on a swivel, fellas. The plates are beginning to slow. I will be shocked if the current regime makes it to 2028 without a cataclysmic reset that sweeps them all  away.

        That is why they obviously cast around for an old white guy.
Shapiro is 9 years younger than Harris. He doesn’t even look old by current standards of American politics.
He is also Ben Shapiro’s (not too distant) cousin, despite both of them lying about it. Both are united in their loyalty to Satan.

This, ladies and gentlemen, is why this blog is the first thing I read when I get my ass out of bed.
In addition to being a well thought out group, you guys (and gals 3g), have made a good amount of coffee find its way through my sinus cavities.

            I agree. The most clear-eyed vision of truth resides here! I thoroughly scan every comment as well! This site, and especially the comments section has been my third political “awakening!” The first being Dr. William Pierce’s “American Dissident Voices” shortwave broadcasts back in the 1990’s. The second was the Black Pigeon Speaks video, “Why Women Destroy Nations.” And now, this! My longtime normiecon friends and neighbors can’t understand what evil spirit now possesses me!

        Her only base of support is the regime
I know lots of left-center people on board with her. Don’t underestimate her support. I remember Republican voters in 2008 thinking Obama was going to lose, bad, or at most was sure to be a one-termer. Like Carter.
Harris is a BIPOC Hillary without the baggage. Also, so many people dislike Trump that Harris doesn’t look so bad. It would be interesting to see how Harris would manage without such a hated figure as Trump.

            She is not as smart as Hillary but equally dislikeable if not as well known.  You are right to urge people not to underestimate her support or how much Trump is disliked.
Hopefully, Trump will get his act together.

        My first impression of Walz is it’s a good political pick for shitlibs, better than Shapiro (although I would have preferred Shapiro to watch the Democrat party split under Jewish/Muslim lines). He’s governor of an important midwest state and he’s a white guy, two things Dems need to win (i.e. to secure a minority of the few remaining white retards who still vote for their own democide). I understand he’s a demonic far leftist in charge during the FBI/CIA-led Floyd riots, but the media simply won’t cover that stuff.

            There’s a certain inevitability to “her” choice. With Walz they have a good chance of carrying Minnesotastan, and Dearborn and Hamtramck are now probably not in play for Trump. Kelly’s interest in a Chinese recon dirigible firm doesn’t smell good, and Shapiro’s status as a Hebrew legionnaire wouldn’t appeal to increasingly ex-military whites. Plus he reminds myself and presumably others of those tedious and grating “diverse” ads that are still being forced down our throats, as though we’re consumer equivalents of Bobby Sands. So while Trumps choice of VP indicates a hope that populism will continue beyond Trump’s term, Team 25th seems to view Walz as the inoffensive, inconsequential antifa-friendly Token White Guy.

        Walz makes sense. He is clearly a cucked, deferential and subservient beta White man.I think the Dem base will barely tolerate a White man, and so if it is a White man, it needs to be a litter runt like Walz. It is quite astonishing how overt the Dem messaging is to White men. ‘You have a temporary role here for the next 4-8 years. You must be feminized, goofy and satisfied but pretend to be overjoyed with being the last subordinate in line. Massiv bonus for 4-8 years of smiling and glad handing total White dispossession after the 4-8 year Whitey Subordinate role has expired.’The Dem machine is formidable. The emergent Small Tech counter elite’s ability to help Trump will turn the election. Women are attracted to strength. If Vance can be strong but avoid offending White women their ovaries may just lead them to vote for Trump/Vance in sufficient numbers to make a steal impossible.Whoever is in a position to get in with Trump or support him at a local level get ready to go all in. We need mass deportations made mostly voluntary by carrots of: no money; no subsidies; no employment.If Trump gets in, he’s got four years to buy the wise a bit more time to get to a redoubt and begin the process of fortification. Our side should be getting into position at a local level to use discretion with state and federal funds to do fortification. Get housing subsidy money. Use it to pay your kind to move into your redoubt. Get it? This is biowarfare so we need to play by the rules they have made.

            I have worked in a major (1 billion+) corporation and also rubbed elbows with several other corporations in the DC area all in the tech sector in recent years.This is literally standard operating mode. It is all betas and soys all day and obsequious bowing and scraping in front of dindus. If you DO happen to see an alpha white male they tread VERY lightly and are quiet as they have an automatic target painted on them. It is a complete reality inversion of who should be on top in a way only clown world can provide. The fact that we have arrived at this place with a lot of (((help))) is just a tragedy even for those stupid enough (mud people, wahmen, etc.) to think they benefit.It will be the ruination of us all because enforcing this Harrison Bergeron style reality where the oppressive weight of mediocrity is tying the entire society down will benefit no one in the long run. They simply are too stupid to see this or care.South Africa hasn’t had whites in any power positions indecades, yet somehow, with the power grid failing, infrastructure crumbling, it is STILL whiteys fault. Women and darkies are not terribly different in that they are both very emotionally driven, impulsive, high time preference and generally lower IQ than White (and Asian) males. Which is why they cannot create civilization.The fervor with which these mewling soy infused beta males accept their servitude boils my blood. It is probably why I no longer work for that org, I have aLOTof trouble hiding my power level so in a room full of cucks I stand out like a sore them even when trying to conceal it.

        Picking Shapiro doesn’t deliver PA. Rigged courts and fake Philly voters will. Plus, the D party base is increasingly brown and pro Pali. Shapiro is a play for money at the expense of alienating half their voters. A lot of those people will have no trouble voting for Trump to get revenge. They also know Trump is reliably anti Middle East War.Mark Kelly is who Obama wants. If it’s somebody else, that’s a poke in Obama’s eye. Black Jesus won’t want to be stood up like that. But it’ll be a sign that Harris isn’t on a leash, which is good for anyone who wants to see a full on meltdown.Minnesota is the only state that bucked Reagan’s 49-state landslide in 84. Home state of Walter Mondale. They’re very worried about turnout if the go there for a VP.The “weird” meme died faster than you can post Tranny Story Hour photos on the internet. Trump in a panic? Lol. The guy has been impeached twice and indicted 4 times. And shot. That narrative will just make people laugh.Flailing for a message is always an obvious sign of trouble.

It’s pretty clear that Obama choked off the oxygen of an entire generation of male Democrats. So it’s thin pickings. That said, this cornpone will make JD Vance, even with all his baggage, look like James Madison.

                    If Mondale had wanted to win, he wouldn’t have picked Ferraro. The fact that he did tells you something: The Democrats had no chance in 1984. None. Reagan was insanely popular even in the New England states. It was a place-setting election for 1988, as the party was increasingly concerned with racial and sexual identity (Jesse Jackson was rising), and wanted to change its “Happy Days Are Here Again” brand from the 1930s, no longer demographically as vital.

            The American public has grown much stupider since 1984, plus now they are distracted with too many gadgets and bombarded with too much information. I bet if 9/11 hit today, within 3 days people would have forgotten about it, like they forgot about the assassination attempt, which I think was fake anyway.

            Yeah, when I sawFargo Bernie Sanders the first thought I had was a reverse Mondale/Ferraro. It also reminded me of how many cuckwhites there are in the upper Midwest.I also recall that back before they had decided to retire Joe Potato I speculated  here that the ideal President or VP for the C-rats was another “Hawaiian Negro”. They needed a man with no personality, no history, no track record of anything that they could re-brand as whatever they need. Apart from the black skin, it seems they found their hominid inWalz. Well, at least I never heard anything about him good or bad. Of course if you told me he was an old White Democrat from Lake Wobegon the State, I would have pictured something pretty much exactly like Walz. Of course, back then (a few weeks ago) I still suspected that they couldn’t be serious about making Kamalaladingdong the Presidential candidate either.There’s still plenty of time before the election to dig up stuff about Walz though. If I were the Repubs, I might try to find some women from his past and get a Me-Too-Choo-Choo rolling on his ass. Perhaps he’ll turn out to be another Al Franken. The base of support for guys like that is women and soyboys so if they think he gets all rapey when the cameras aren’t around maybe they don’t vote.

        Take heart you guys. The old nickel goes that money talks, and BS walks. All Cackles and her machine can do is steal money – they can’t create it. Empires are pretty much done when they start preying on their own citizens.

Yup.
They must see that the clapping seals in Congress who performed that disgusting 4 minute screaming ovation for the Butcher of Gaza haven’t caught up with the people. I was very impressed reading the NYT comment section after the latest Thomas Friedman column – 80% hard anti-Zionist, only a few Ben Shapiro posters. The world is changing…

I don’t think this can be pulled off, but the idiocy runs deep with the late-stage Regime. Obviously Harris is more or less mentally retarded and is familiar with doing the nasty for money, so her appeal as a puppet is understood.

                    No doubt. Biden erased any doubts that the president exerts any actual power. Trump terrified/terrifies them because he theoretically could have exerted power, although that didn’t happen and won’t happen if he is re-elected.
Harris is so breathtakingly stupid, though, even Normie will notice it. I could see accelerationists getting behind her to hasten the day.

Obviously you haven’t spent enough time in urban blue environments controlled by grrlpower. “Educated,” younger women are going to vote for Harris in droves. To them Trump reeks of their grandfather who’s still stuck in 1982 and smells like farts.
(BTW there is no “free world,” in many ways it’s become as totalitarian and as ideological as the USSR was…)

Not too far off, really.  Look at her current compatriots in the free world.  Leaders of Britain, France, Germany as of recent vintage.  When we say clown world, we really mean “world”.  If things don’t change, she’ll fit right in.  The only uplifting thought is that our allies seem to be waking up and in the process of perhaps throwing the bums out.  US always seems to follow in these trends, so perhaps a Harris presidency is not in the future.  One can dream.

                    Yes, the lynchpin of the “free world” is the USSA.  The one thing, and the only thing, that checks this is that it can only be the USSA to the extent it can function at all.  So it’s the USSA in the aspects it can keep hobbling along enough to function at least to some effective baseline degree, and otherwise it’s AINO.

        The Walz pick is so stupid, I’m thinking Shapiro must have quietly turned her down. Pennsylvania is ball game. Z makes a good point about Shapiro’s IDF service, but I’m not sure this iteration of the Trump campaign would even bring it up.
Now, the Dems get to defend riots, trannies, lockdowns and mind boggling corruption in one of the most operationally left wing states.
And get tagged as antisemites, to boot. It would take a heart of stone not to laugh.
Fraud is their only hope.

            That’s a good point; we’re supposed to believe that VP is one step away, when actually it seems more of a career killer.  My stunted brain can’t think of any Veep who went on to great things afterwords.  Tim Kaine, maybe?

        Minnesota liberals are giddy at the prospect of it being Walz.  I was listening to Classical MPR in the car this morning and the host told everyone to make sure their NPR news alerts were turned on so they would get the news when it was announced.  He then threw in a line about how the stock market was rebounding this morning.  I got to my desk and saw the DOW futures were barely up.  Twin Cities liberals especially loved the lockdowns and love their Governor.  Walz is a mediocre blowhard, I don’t think he does anything to help Kamala on the ticket, or if elected govern effectively.  He had a couple of terms in Congress before becoming governor.  This would be a real flex for the regime, but not surprising they would want to try it.

                He was all in on the peaceful protests in Minneapolis. The description of him as Fargo Bernie Sanders is accurate.  This would be a good issue for the Trump campaign to push when Walz starts his aw shucks routine.

                    The Trump campaign is delusionally intent on winning the black vote, and never even mentioning White voters.  I doubt if Trump will take advantage of Walz’ support for the Peaceful Protests and Floyd and the new Somalian-like Minnesota state flag.

                        Of course he won’t. Even the most oblique criticism of the nuggras is practically a capital crime in AINO. Trump, who seems to be a negrophile anyway, won’t touch it.

                    Flanagan is a common feather Indian name, I’m sure and she’s a member of the White Earth tribe, seriously? She looks like her true tribe is somewhere near the Eastern Med, not Minnesota.

                            Allegedly her father was an Indian activist named Marvin Mannypenny.  He looked like he was around 50% Indian.  He was like the Indian equivalent of an ANC official.  It would be wholly unsurprising if she attempted to take land from whites and give it to Indians if she became Governor.

        It will be interesting to see who they pick.  Don’t underestimate Harris’s charisma.  She has it but it is more the daytime talk show host charisma than the leader of nations charisma.  And there are a lot of stupid women who are into daytime talk shows.  And stupid Gen Zers who are into Tik Tok personalities.Trump needs to up his game, especially his get out the (white) vote efforts, or he will lose again.  The Dems are harvesting away and he is courting the black vote because his ego tells him he can get more black votes than any other Republican.  If he continues with this nonsense instead of focusing on immigration, inflation and crime he will lose and I won’t care if the throw him in jail.

                There is no “Harris phenomenon”. It’s all fake. Every penny of it. What a strange choice of words.Here’s what went down: Biden was supposed to drop out peacefully and he would then be replaced in an open convention by Newsom or somebody like him at the convention. Biden refused, despite all the last minute media dog piling once they realized he wasn’t going to leave peacefully. Then, he takes a big fall or has some sort of medical episode in Vegas. They don’t think he’s going to survive and in a panic they send out a letter – not written or probably even read by Biden – dropping out. Then it hits them a few hours later: what happens to all those delegates and all that money? If there’s an open convention, control of all of that is up for grabs. So, what do the Biden’s do?Revenge. They issue a second letter a bit later endorsing Kamala Harris. This closes down the convention and keeps all the money in place. Just some paperwork from donors agreeing to shift their money to Harris. It was also a big old middle finger to Democrats who tried to push him down the stairs. “You want me to drop out? Well, here’s Kamala Harris.”There is no Harris phenomenon in the conventional sense of that word.There is only the panic and overkill advertising in an effort to make it appear like she has some broad appeal in hopes they can fool people.But the problem with hyper-marketing is that it is a signal that the product is really, really, bad. Even our more intellectually challenged citizens know this. The more you have to hype it, the worse it is.

            Don’t underestimate people who vote party.  There are millions and millions of people who do not care what the name on the ballot is.  “Mr Ho Lee Fuk” can win an election anywhere where there is a one party state.  This is why the more conservative a constituency is, the more of a cuck the republican politician is.Tens of millions of people are going to vote Harris no matter what.  There are probably an equal number of people who will go in and hit R no matter who it is.  Mitt Romney and McCain got 10s of millions of votes.  That should tell you something.

            Trump did poorly with white men in 2020, his overall share of the white vote was below Bush or McCain.
If he can’t push his white vote higher – like, 58% (2020) to 64% or higher – he’s going to lose.

        I don’t think any of it matters.  In 2016, Trump was a major shock.  They did not anticipate that he could win.  They were completely unprepared for him.  But he blew it. He surrounded himself with cucks and people who hated him.  After nearly 2 years of chanting “build the wall,” we got the usual tax cuts for the rich we expect from Republicans. He had the House and Senate and still couldn’t get anything done.But now it’s different. They are fully prepared for a Trump presidency.  They have all the plans laid out to prevent him doing anything should he win. Worse, even if he wins, it will be one term at best assuming they cannot get rid of him by other means.  They likely already have a bunch of lawsuits set up in the friendliest districts for anything they think he will do.  Even if Trump actually started deportations day one, it will be tied up in court for the entire term.Even trying to stop the war in Ukraine will probably not be successful. Not only will they block him, but Putin knows Trump will only be in office 4 years and the swamp will start the war machine back up in 2028.

            Couple of nitpicks.  Most wealthy people saw their personal income taxes go up due to the collapsed number of tax brackets.  And the Unitary Executive ruling by the SCOTUS (“immunity” case) means that Trump cannot be threatened with prosecution by his own DOJ/FBI for obstruction of justice if he starts declassifying things that matter.A lot of the power wielded against Presidents is this corny idea that has existed for 50 years that Executive Branch employees of the President can indict the President.  That’s torched now.  They even implied that he can fire people whenever he wants because every bureaucrat in the Federal government is just a tiny bit of delegated power from the President.  Firing a bureaucrat now is like having a mole excised.The question is whether Trump will use that power.  I understand your skepticism based on experience.Getting shot combined with that SCOTUS ruling = revenge.

                First, taxes need to be dramatically increased, especially on the wealthy and corporations and things like unearned income. We should have 90+% top marginal rate.I get that most people around here, myself included are highly skeptical of taxes. Usually tax increases are used to fund more evil. But we have 35 trillion Dollars of debt. Outside of increasing taxes, there are only 2 ways to deal with this. Either it is inflated away, which is a very high tax on every man, woman and child in the US or it is defaulted on. If we default, taxes will need to be dramatically increased or spending dramatically lowered (or a combination). if they lower spending, it will be cutting all essential government services. They will never voluntarily cut warfare spending or expertocracy spending or giving money to Israel or paying academics to write endless papers nobody reads. The DC suburbs will remain the highest income zipcodes in America.Plus, most of the wealthy and large corporations absolutely hate us. They are the bad guys. I’d like to see all of their money taken and have them thrown in jail. Many of these large corporations are AINO. They don’t have any production in the US. Just a corporate headquarters. These are the same people flooding our neighborhoods with foreigners and agitating them to hate us.History is proof the tax rate does not lower productivity. The postwar boom was an era of 90% top marginal rate. Few people paid it anyway. They upgraded equipment and did other things that were good for business and counted as write-offs in the tax code. It favored small businesses over large ones. Plus, our productivity has been falling for decades despite low taxes. I know the official statistics say otherwise, but if productivity were rising, we wouldn’t have $75 billion a month trade deficits.Trump is not going to cut the bureaucracies. We’re already probably headed for recession and those cuts would deepen the recession. Trump spent his whole presidency begging Powell to cut rates. He was involved in all the fiscal tomfoolery in 2020.Despite Trump’s questionable governance, I still favor him over Harris or anyone else the swamp will elevate. I just don’t think he is capable of doing what needs to be done.

                    I guess we’ll find out. Personnel has not been his strong suit. But he seems to have learned from this.There’s an old saying from the 1700’s by some guy named Samuel Johnson, “Depend upon it, sir, when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.”I think that assassination attempt – and Trump’s promise to declassify every aspect of the investigation – is his way of accusing the regime of trying to kill him. The only reason to keep most of the investigation secret is to protect government employees. Unless you believe there are other suspects at large…which they’ve categorically denied exist.There are a lot of things like tariffs (“but but free trade!”) and tax rates and military force that wide swaths of the country now understand to be lies. People have figured out the immigration lies, too, but the government just ignores them.Nobody will pay an effective tax rate of 90%. They’ll evade it. Those who don’t will find away to make poor people pay for it by passing on the costs. Just like the $20 “minimum wage”.

                        I agree many will get around it.  I said:“History is proof the tax rate does not lower productivity. The postwar boom was an era of 90% top marginal rate. Few people paid it anyway”We have a ton of government and it needs to be paid for.  It can be inflation if that is what you prefer.  I prefer honest high taxes for the people who benefit the most.   If we had a normal country, people wouldn’t be trying to support a family working as a Walmart cashier or serving french fries at McDonald’s.I don’t oppose free trade in principle.  Like it would probably work and be beneficial for both countries like the UK and US or Canada and the US or the UK and Canada. They are similar countries with similar laws and regulations and standards of living and a generally free curency.It’s when you try to have it with Vietnam or China or Japan back in the 70s.  College grads (Master’s) are making 3-5k Yuan a month ($420-.$700 a month).  The regulations are entirely different.  There’s a bunch of state owned enterprises and other tax subsidized manufacturing.  Plus, they have all of our production equipment.  It’s not even trade.  It’s American companies moving production to China and other low wage low regulation countries.

            But that’s the point of Zman’s column.  “Regime-ology” was about trying to figure out what was actually going on by reading between the lines of what the Soviets were leaking or doing.  Because everything they said was a lie, it took some skill to figure out where the nuggets of truth were.Picking Shapiro was a trial balloon to see how crazy the pro-Pali wing of the part is.  That rumor didn’t survive more than a couple of days.  Kelly in AZ is known to be an Obama guy.  Walz is a MN socialist WASP.  They are very worried about turnout if their VP pick is a nondescript white guy from the very heart of midwestern socialism – Minnesota.  They needed a guy who could tell the white people in the party not to leave just yet.  And, somebody with no future prospects.  If they can’t steal the election in November, Walz just goes back to being a governor and his career ends in obscurity.Walz is the “lost cause” pick.  Somebody they can ruin without hurting their limited bench if viable candidates.

        This is a blow to elitism in Democratic party politics.  Shapiro went to Georgetown law school.  Walz got a degree to teach Social Studies from Chadron State in Nebraska, which is considered the worst college in Nebraska.  He got a Masters from Mankato St in Minnesota which is just a quick summer course teachers take so that the school district is required to pay them a higher salary. Without checking, I would be surprised if there has been anyone on a major party ticket with lower academic accomplishments in the last 100 years, if ever.

        The fastest way to the bottom is via another clearly stolen election (after midnight vote counting) in which heels-up is placed in the oval office and the house of cards collapses soon thereafter. You can’t  let in another 30 million military-age male invaders without consequence and keep printing fake fiat $trilliions forever. There will be a reckoning and the battle will be two-fold. First the LEOs will step forward in service to their pensions to quell the “white guys” and that will be followed by a jackboot corp composed of illegals. They want to engage in the streets. Which leaves the backdoor open. Plan accordingly.

            What the LEOs will do is the big question.
They may stay out of it to protect their own hearth and home. Side with close kin or their pay masters? Divided loyalties I suspect, which will make things all the more perilous. Worse case, both sides nearly equal in number and strength. Thing is, one side enjoys troop replacements while other doesn’t…maybe, maybe not…brothers from UK?

                LEOs are the sideshow; let normie confront them in the streets, it will keep both busy and out of the way. Plus the fog of chaos is a necessary precursor. Think outside the box and act only where it hurts. Smarter, not harder.

        I hope it will be difficult for liberal white men to watch Walz lavishly praise a stupid and off-putting non-white woman who owes everything she has to tribalism. This is what you must do, white cucks, if you want to survive in the new anti-white order. If you have any self-respect left, I hope that it makes you feel sick.

            It won’t make them sick any more than it makes a kneeling Yeshuolater sick to worship a guy who committed the world’s most glorified suicide. These race masochists understand about as well as you that immivader privilege was revoked from European Americans and transferred to other nations. (Ths is the “Civil Rights” movement in a nutshell.) Unlike you, however, it feels good to them to be race masochists for the unipolar order. They obtain atonement for their degradation, and they even have a doctrine of original sin to replace the equally scurrilous doctrine of original sin preached to our enslaved ancestors for more than 1,000 years. It all makes perfect sense to them.

        I don’t think it will be Shapiro, as he, just like Governor Hairgel and the rest of the satraps, know that hitching themselves to Harris will tie them to a millstone if she is “elected” since all the cumulative disasters of Chomo Joe’s reign are hers as well, in addition to the disasters coming down the pike, both foreign and domestic. Far better to let Harris girlboss her way to failure for four years without you being associated with it, which removes a rival in 2028, and if the Bad Orange Man somehow comes out on top, leading the “Resistance” to him and his legions of Magashirts sets them up for 28 against Vance.

                Yep. Walz delivers the Minnesota DFL vote and the Somali vote. The fact that they picked him over the Jew Shapiro is an obvious tell that they are worried about the Muslims, the brown people and the hard Left refusing to support the ticket over the Gaza child slaughter.
Of course, the Jews will still be in control of the Harris administration, but she’s got to put up a front to keep the nonwhites and the Lefties quiescent.

                That was my thought, for what it’s worth. They absolutely cannot afford a whole bunch of Sudden Onset Jihad Syndrome between now and November — it’s hard to Fortify the precincts if the polling places keep experiencing Sudden Unplanned Disassembly Events. Had they nominated Juggalo Josh, it would be clear that the Harris administration will be dominated by Our Greatest Ally.(Of course, now they have to make nicey-nice with our Pali-bros, who will be out in force at their convention. That will not go so well, especially given how much money they’ll expect AIPAC, Hollywood, etc. to pony up. But as our host says, they can never see past the first move, so… there it is).

                    Thead hocnature tells us that there in fact was some major medical emergency that hobbled the “Biden” candidacy. I doubt the Walz choice costs the Dems many Jewish votes (institutional support, yeah, but that was shaky already), but the PaliBros will fly their freak flags even higher now. They’ve shown a great deal of restraint up until now but like the scorpion, their nature is to sting. Will pro-Pali, anti-Israel demonstrations, which are going to be dialed up to 11 after a little taste of blood, be worse than the anti-Shapiro rioting would have been? Dunno. Take note that when the Regime failed to murder Trump, it called off the RNC riots, so there is a lot of pent-up rage ready to rip.

        One big problem with the Walz pick is that of geography: midwesterners become generally less stupid and less naive the farther east and south you get from Eau Claire, Wisconsin.
But none of this matters if the traitors in the FBI, Secret Service and CIA try to murder Trump again and succeed.

        Walz it is. I have a passing familiarity with him from being the occasional reader at Power Line. Given his reputation stemming from the Covid-19 “pandemic” and the circus that was the aftermath of the martyrdom of St. Floyd of Minneapolis, his Progressive credentials seem bona fide. Gov. Walz is nominally Lutheran, but likely favors a certain Tribe quite the opposite of what Martin Luther preached. As such, he’s a perfect candidate for being another Deep State puppet.

            Mr. Luther only discovered his position late in life, after his political stances put him in contact with nominal allies. They didn’t end up being allies.Jews and Their Lies was one of his last works and it’s mostly only a Christian Scripture apologetic.

        I guess it’s been a long time – maybe forever – that presidents have been nothing much more than figureheads.  But at least you figured tptb would install those that had some plausible authority or at least looked and/or spoke as if they wielded authority.  But the installation of kameltoe in particular dispels that myth in its entirety.  If something like this doesn’t point to the end of empire, I don’t know what does.  The only thing more ridiculous would be to slap a helmet on her melon and an AR-15 in her hands (aka Dukakis) – maybe as a recruiting poster for the war with Iran – LOL…

                The British people are speaking the wrong language.  The elite across the West only understands 1 language.Fear holds criminals in check, at least at the margins. This is true of the political and elite classes.  Since they no longer fear the law because they’ve captured and weaponized the law, that leaves only fear of people.  The Muzzies and other diverse peoples keep the politicians in fear.  The British people have not done anything to make the political and elite classes fear them, to fear the consequences of their evil.One of the Rotherham cases involved the fathers of 2 girls who were locked in a house, strung out on dope being forced to be “sex workers” (God, I hate that euphemism).  They were the only White people in that house.  The girls were both stoned and underage.  Guess who got arrested?  Yeah, the fathers.  The simple fact of the matter is, arresting the Pakis would have meant mobs at the police station screaming racism and threatening riots.  Arresting the fathers, OTOH, would be met with dank memes on the internet.  This has the added bonus of arresting the dank meme makers for hate speech (truth is not a defense to hate speech).

                    You not keeping up with the news?
As far as I am aware the English rioters are the first Western white people openly acting on a tribal basis; that’s new.Cops attacked and their cars burnt is not nothing.
The Americans,Canadians and even the Gilet Jaune were fighting/demonstrating for abstract nouns like “freedom”.The English have acted on behalf of the English.I’d say that’s progress.
More of this.

                        Absolutely. Keep it up Brits, and then some. Ideally, several thousand wogs get slaughtered, which compels the rest to behide themselve to their original shitholes, and deters any more of them from setting another scabies-ravaged foot on our shores ever again.

            Wise choice.They’re all in oncunty,guaranteeing near-100% support among everyone but white heterosexuals.Walz is the oldest Democrat who’s fully adopted the sensibilities of the millennial Twitter woman/tranny—the political form of the late-in-life lesbian, rather like Sailer (whose tingles are visible on seismograph). So the VP matchup is between Vance, who’s cynically playing the character of an older man, and his own true self in the body of an older man. It is, as they say, weird.The top of the ticket is known quantity vs. nonentity, so irrelevant peripheral nonsense—media noise—will be decisive. Walz is uniquely consonant with that noise. Decisive victory.(The above assumes a normal election where votes are counted, etc. In reality we don’t have those. Also, Trump’s getting shot again.)

            I disagree. He is a far left loon who was protesting with BLM and making excuses for them. There is no escaping this.  There is plenty there to be dug up and put on display.
But, they could have chosen a homeless drug addict for all the effect it will have on 90% of voters.  Minnesota was already a shoe-in for the election.  It really doesn’t make any sense.
My guess is they chose him because he is spineless, malleable and will dutifully repeat anything he is told to say, just like Kamala.

                It may be a dead cat bounce. We’ll see by the end of the week. I’m thinking it’s the churlish market sending a message to the Fed’s, and by so, essentially drawing a line in the sand. Fed now knows it needs to yield to Wall Street demand or suffer the consequences of a recession before the election. Who’ll cave first in this highly political situation?

Not an issue since both Vance and Trump are Zio Cucks. In fact, if Vance had to do over again, I’m sure a lot of cuck Republicans would also join the Israeli military. Just look at all these losers fighting on the Ukrainian side.
