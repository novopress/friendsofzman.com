        If people still doubt that Tiny Hat Krew are at the top of the stack, remind them of Lawrence “member of the” Tribe.  He was caught committing not just plagiarism but of passing off his students’ work as his own.  He is still professor emeritus of Harvard.

        They had women in academia figured out back in the 70s:
“My theory by A. Elk. Brackets Miss, brackets. This theory goes asfollows and begins now. All brontosauruses are thin at one end, much, muchthicker in the middle and then thin again at the far end. That is my theory,it is mine, and belongs to me and I own it, and what it is too.”
-Monty Python’s Flying Circus Episode 31  (look Ma I did the citation!)

        As if he had seen my comment about university endowments below, Senator J.D. Vance (R-OH) introduced a bill to tax those endowments at a 35% rate:

Unfortunately this bill was blocked by the pig Wyden (D-OR) as the mask fell entirely away.

            I’d settle for taxing them at all. Of course I realize the futility of wasting any more time than this wishing for such a thing.

        Adjacent to today’s post, in my brief time in industrial automation I’ve come to notice how many of the green hoaxes and scams emanate from the businesses and universities in the Cambridge, Massachusetts area.
Heck, in the battery space alone there are all these amazing startups with magical technology that can solve every problem that is not called, “exiting the small-scale lab environment.”

        Looking at images of the spectacular and precision-based ugliness of Dr. Gay, resplendent in Fearless Fly glasses, I’ve wondered what her inevitable autobiography would be titled, “Lucy’s” Child having already been taken.

        Morgoth has a topical post in regards to the one she-boss who was easily and quickly tossed overboard. Ironically, as you’ll see when you get to the end of his great essay, it is quite sad that they cast us overboard first.

            that life has become exponentially more difficult across multiple fronts but it has not been formalized and made ‘‘official’’ by the authorities and so there’s an added layer of confusion and unnerving gloom like in a David Lynch film—Yeah a lot of that.  We know “it’s all wrong” but we’re not allowed to discuss it, and it will certainly never be presented in some authoritative chart.

        This is an appropriate post for me to leave my periodic reminder that the Reign of Terror ended only because the first order of business of the leaders of the Thermidorian Reaction was to execute Robespierre and the leaders of his movement. Lesson learned.

        “No matter how much the various factions of the permanent revolution may hate one another, they all agree that they hate you more than they hate anything else on this earth. That is because you are the living rebuke of everything they claim for themselves.”This is nonsense as applied to ordinary, run of the mill, American Jews, now relegated to the curse of whiteness and who know they have more to fear from the wokesters than from “The Jews Will Not Replace Us” crowd.Dissident Jew bashers are the Jews’ useful idiots and, as “Queers For Palestine” demonstrate, idiots who are useful are still, for all that, idiots.

            I did not see any bashing. I work with two “run of the mill, American Jews.” Never even thought about them being Jewish, until… October 9th. Then their distinct identity came to the forefront, and they were suddenly no longer “white.”Honestly, I respect them. If only my ethnic group had such pride in a distinct identity.And, if not clear, distinct identity always contains at least a portion of “who we are not” and “who we hate.” Otherwise, you are not much of a distinct people.

            imbroglio:  “Ordinary, run of the mill, American Jews” are the sea in which the ADL and its minions swim.  And the fact that they maintain a distinct and separate identity is clearly evident in how quickly they mobilized their message and narrative after Oct.7.   I had no idea that you, yourself, were Jewish until you began posting comments after the Hamas attack.As Eloi noted, and Citizen of a Silly Country has said, to a certain extent that sense of positive identity is admirable – especially in one’s own country amongst one’s own people.  I only wish more Whites had such a clear sense of who they are.  But in the case of “American Jews” this creates an obvious conflict, unless one considers Heritage America and Israel to be one nation with the same domestic and foreign policy goals.I speak for no one but myself here, but I harbor no sympathy for Hamas.  They are not my people, and I cannot condone anyone kidnappying or harming young children.  BUT . . . Israeli Jews are not my people either.  This is not America’s fight, however much the Hasbara propaganda pushes the idea that Hamas will come for Whites next.  Yes, many of us remember the whole “Fight them over there” lie.  We also remember who pushed hard for decades to ensure ‘they’ – along with every other alien race and religion – flooded into America to make it less Christian White and thus ‘safer’ for the Jews.So sorry the non-White natives are getting restless, and control of money and funding is no longer keeping them all in line.  The heritage White natives are getting restless, too, and most of us know that any purported movement of Jews to the putative ‘conservative’ side of AINO’s uniparty will not change their identity nor their fundamentally anti-White ethos.

            Thanks for the advice, but I think that I’ll pass. I know that Jews only have whites’ best interests at heart, but, surprisingly, following your advice over the past 60 years hasn’t worked out so well for whites.
Odd.

            Things are bashed all over, guy. The idea that all non-Republican racist spoilsports are “objectively on the left” was a near daily News Corp screech during the Rove 9/11 years (prob was targeted more at libertoids before that) and those opinionators apparently really believed themselves heirs to a “historic realignment,” ha ha. Which why we have now the Jeb Bush Administration wrapping up his lame duck term as chief freedom officer. Also, did you see— Osama Bin Laden’s cranky blog posts somehow got into the Recycle Bin of History, not the trash can, so remember to sort your papers and plastics correctly next time

            I actually have a lot of sympathy for run of the mill Jews as you call them, that are not sympathetic to the woke agenda. But the JQ is not just fantasy. People like MacDonald who meticulously document the involvement, often central, of Jews in the promulgation of highly destruktive and, frankly, disgusting and treasonous ideas and policies, are slandered and attacked. But they’re rarely refuted credibly. Likewise the insistence that Israel must be a Jewish state while Jews were demonstrably highly involved in the destruction of a country like Sweden, is clearly hypocritical.Now demographic replacement is getting serious and so whites have very real grievances against the role Jews have played   I’d be interested to hear what Jews who are not trying to destroy the demographics of the West. Maybe Jews used to be the more victimized. But now we have real wounds too and frankly scores to settle. Maybe it’s just baked in by now that we have to be enemies. If not, how do we rebuild trust now?

        It is a long, unfortunately slow, but happily ongoing process for the Ivy League to lose its status. Following the current trajectory, there will come a day, eventually, when the only people impressed by a Harvard degree are Harvard grads, and not even all of them. The employment of a mediocrity (I’m being kind) such as Ms. Gay is a strong indicator that the institution is well past the point that it can fix itself, and that the trajectory will not change. Maybe it was still fixable 30 years ago, but not anymore. For better or worse this correlates with a lot of other baked in, irreversible decline in the west.

That doesn’t matter a bit to them as long as the Harvard grads are the ruling elite hiring the next batch of Harvard grads.

                All true, but the downward spiral of competence will make (has made?) them incapable of running much of anything, and presumably, at some point, this will lead to a loss of power.

            I can confirm that, as a Harvard grad…even 30 years ago, I was unimpressed with some of the people being given degrees at Harvard, and it seems to have gotten worse…If you aspire to be the best, you take the best people, and Harvard gave that up decades back….

                pyrrhus:  I knew a number of Harvard undergrads in my time.  They freely admitted doing almost nothing all semester long, and then feverishly studying and memorizing during their weeks’ long (3-4 but I don’t recall for certain) study period prior to final exams.  We had a measly 3 days to study, and simply passing or even acing a final exam did not equal passing a class, which almost universally included a midterm and at least a couple of papers.The Harvard undergrads  were lazy and entitled, and the hardest work they did was getting admitted.  After that it was smooth and easy sailing.

            These universities, with multi billion dollar endowments, are now just investment funds masquerading as educational institutions. Despite all their money it never occurs to them to use it to reduce tuition costs for their students. Their only mission is indoctrination of the next generation and doing whatever they can to offend the sensibilities of White middle class Americans.

                Nick Nolte’s Mugshot:  There is also a huge element of triumphalism.  The small hats and their woke foot soldiers took Harvard and the other Ivies from the Protestant heritage Americans who founded them, and they are not going to cede that control or skin-suit prestige without a fight.

                NNM-
Those endowments are a huge obstacle to restoring sanity in the USSA.
Each university has a dedicated team of well-paid pros whose sole mission is to grow the endowment.
This means each university has its own money printer.
The worst situations are when you have a libbed out university with a $2.4 billion endowment situated in a rural town of 9500.
Yes, Grinnell, Iowa, I’m looking at you.
Anyone who thinks that Grinnell’s massive endowment doesn’t completely distort normal town life can just…well, as Elon said, “Hi, Bob!”

                    Just putting that $2.4 billion in a money market, at present rates, would provide about $114 million annually, a sum pretty close to what Grinnell charges for room/board/fees to its students. Which is about $76k per year. ($76k x 1,700 or so students = $129 million roughly)
For Harvard, with its upwards of $50 billion endowment, there is of course no good reason for anyone attending to have to pay tuition.

            I used to think that Harvard and Princeton especially, my two favorite ivies  because they’re the strongest in the sciences, were genius schools. Only later did I realize that that’s not their secret. A school that takes in primarily high IQ sperg types, becomes “uncool”, which is to say lacks social or “soft” power. Places like MIT, Caltech or the university of Chicago, are more this profile. And while they have very smart people, they trail in impact.The ivies play a different game. They want people that are high IQ that are socially dominant. Sure they want some that are super geeks but mostly they want social winners. This is a strong strategy in stable times. But is a recipe for obsolescence when there is a transformation of the culture. Woke has hit diminishing returns with their screeching. And the ivies went all in on woke. This spells trouble . It’s like having worthless stocks that were pure gold before the crash. Or perhaps more fitting having last week’s lottery numbers

                    It’s not parody, it’s reality.
If I recall correctly, a few years back Harvard’s Negro “scholar” Cornel West was denied tenure because he cut a rap CD and Jewish then-president Larry Summers refused to accept it as “scholarship.”
Forbes just ran an article no how West, despite having “earned” millions, blew it all and is now broke, in true street-pimp fashion:

            In the early 90s when it came out that “Dr.” Martin Luther King plagiarized his doctoral dissertation at Boston U. from Jack Boozer, he was excused with terms like voice merging, intertextualization, alchemizing, yoking, echoing, and several more from Professor Keith Miller, Arizona State University, who wrote a defense of King at the time.“Prof. Miller says that non-whites, who have strong oral traditions, should not be held to stuffy, Western standards of bibliography and that King could not be expected to understand the demands of an alien white culture.”Alex Haley (Roots) and Maya Angelou also plagiarized their work, and were also excused.

        ‘The reason these girl bosses exist, regardless of their form, is they are a rebuke to the unifying enemy which is the white man.’Yup.  It’s been a Revolution of Resentment the past half-century.Their war is against masculinity and fatherhood in general, and ultimately against God the Father.  And the choice target has been the Evil White Male, no question.The stronk ‘n empowered girlbosses can never feel good about themselves as long as their betters are, well better.  Any amount of freedom, authority or relevance we retain must be crushed.  Dubble that for the stronk ‘n empowered of-color girlbosses.Ninety percent of Regime attitudes and actions are in-your-face displays of their empowerment, and of our disempowerment.  A constant state of incitement.  Like J6 or the Planetary Lockdown, everything now is We will do whatever we want, whatcha gonna do about it?‘It is also a useful reminder that the progressive is out there. It can’t be bargained with . . . (A)nd it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.’These people and groups enjoy tormenting their prey first, as proven by the past 50 years.  Simply killing us isn’t sufficient: we must be fully and publicly disenfranchised and disempowered, because only via this theatre can they show the world (and themselves) our inferiority, and their superiority.Us being dead doesn’t give them that charge, as there is no Deplorable Foil against whom to fulminate, resent, hate and mock.  As they are fond of saying, ‘Love Wins!’  :O)

        The “elite” universities scam will, in time, still fail.I recently went through this with my daughter. Schools separate out the “gifted” at an early age. Although my daughter graduated high school with a little over 500 kids, she only went to school with about 60. They all were in the “gifted” program, the honors classes, and took advanced placement courses. The Asians went to the schools one level below the Ivy League and are paying a pretty penny for it (STEM degrees). The two black kids both, despite lower scores, got full rides to Ivy League schools (worthless degrees). The White kids are commuting to the state university with full rides (STEM degrees). Oddly, the White girls she knows that weren’t part of the “nerd group” are all borrowing money to go out-of-state (worthless degrees). The “non-nerd” White boys are, mostly, either playing video games or working in the trades.The “elite” schools are not winning.

            McLeod:  If you genuinely want your White daughter to ‘win,’ don’t waste your money and her time sending her to college to be taught to hate her heritage and people.  Don’t get her trained to take a job that ought to go to a White man.  Don’t let her marinate in the hatred and dysfunctional anti-White, anti-male land blue-haired and tatted landwhales at college.  Don’t let her hookup with a jogger sportsball player.If you truly love your daughter and believe what you claim to believe, teach her that her highest and most rewarding calling will be to marry and serve as a help-mate to a good man, and raise children.  She will need a mind trained in budgeting and finance, culture and literature, and history and ethics to succeed at this job.    Do your daughter the ultimate favor and don’t raise her to think she needs a ‘career’ or to be ‘self fulfilled’ or independent.  It’s all lies and hopium.Live your values.

The Regime depends on men sending their daughters to Slut U. to learn how better to loathe their dads, and all white men.The Christian and ‘conservative’ dads have been at this also, since the Eighties.  Proud of it, too.   Sigh.You want to be a Christian?  Raise your daughters under your authority until giving them to a husband, at which time she’s under hubby’s authority.  NOT daddy’s authority, and NOT the State’s authority.

                        Jeffrey — I’ve lived in Latin America almost a decade.  It isn’t easy for an old man, but there are reasons for expatriation, and they are all cultural and inter-personal.  Extended family is still big here.  So is Christianity.
I can’t be a man in my own country, they keep wanting to accuse me and lock me up, though I’ve committed no crime except masculinity.  Whereas here I am respected, accepted and even loved.
Ain’t much of a choice, really.

                If the greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the world he didn’t exist, his second greatest trick was convincing women that it’s liberating to spend 10 hours a day in a cubicle filing TPS reports, rather than raising their own kids.You have to laugh at the virtue-signaling companies that recently said if abortions were banned in their states, they would pay for their pregnant employees to fly out of state.  I guess I am just cynical to point out how much cheaper it is for the company to have them back in their cubicle the next day, rather than providing maternity leave.

        The response of the Right is so sadly predictable.Rufo praises Jewish donors for fighting against antisemitism while not noticing that these same donors have been perfectly happy with their universities’ hatred toward whites for decades.Rufo views this as an opportunity to promote his dream of a colorblind society, even as the Jewish donors hyper-focus on fighting for their ethnicity.Sailer is even worse. He notices that Jewish donors are all for the Jews. But he continues with his hope the Jews will discover that promoting hatred against whites will backfire on them because non-whites view Jews as white. In essence, the hate whitey agenda is “bad for the Jews.”Sailer’s whole plan amounts to begging the bully to stop punching you in the face because he’s going to hurt his hand at some point. Pathetic.That all said, this affair is still good for whites. Some are noticing that you can fight back. (These naive souls think that Jews are just a subset of whites, so in their minds, whites are fighting back. They’ll learn the truth later.) Some are noticing that Jews were fine with colleges being anti-white, but when those schools turned on Jews, they freaked out, i.e., hey, maybe Jews aren’t on our side after all.But this idea that Jews will join Team Whitey because of this is laughable. Jewish identity is now centered on the Holocaust. For them, Team Whitey is Team Nazi. No, Jews will just force non-white leaders (if not all non-whites) to pretend that Jews are a part of Team Victim, indeed, that Jews are biggest victims of all.After all, Jews pay for the say, so they can make the actors say whatever they want.

            Agreed in full. Ackman said he had contributed tens of millions to Harvard without fully appreciating the insidious effects of DEI. Yeah, right, David. This is a good thing. Many whites on the higher end of the intelligence spectrum are seeing for the first time who their most vicious and effective enemies are. The paradigm has been shifting of late due to immediate harm. It is nice to see that shift accelerated by knowledge. Young white men refusing to degrade and debase themselves with military service was the canary in the coalmine, as unrelated as it may seem.

                Agree. Whites refusing to join the military is a huge sign. Something is breaking under the surface. Whether they are developing a sense of ethnic identity, I don’t know, but they’re certainly noticing that others have it.
As to Ackman and his fellow Wall Street Jews, yes, it’s great to see them screaming antisemitism every day, all day. Sadly, most whites won’t notice the hypocrisy, but many, especially well-off whites and whites who went to these schools, will.

                    They don’t “notice” the hypocrisy because they don’t want to notice it.
It is and has been for years, so blatant and in your face that only the very dullest among us could fail to notice.
Most of them are directly benefiting from the existing order.  Some are just cowards hoping to be eaten last, but most go along to get along and don’t want to rock the boat in any way. They don’t just stay silent, they actively participate.

                        There are two distinct conservative/right-wing/non-left attitudes toward actual existing hierarchy.One (manly) is that a world that’s failing, degenerate, stupid, misruled, etc., has its hierarchies all wrong—as a result, or as “root cause.”The other (womanly) is that hierarchy is inherently right and righteous, so, e.g., the fact that Jews dominate American society means that both Jews and America deserve it. When they replace you, it’s because you were always already a loser. Everything that happens is an epiphenomenon of *rank* that precedes it.The latter is the mental world of Sailer and the graph nerds, Spencer and the glowfags, “bootstrap” normie-cons (especially Christians), “Straussians,” etc.—and the actual existing left, which rules all their lives and minds, rightly and rightfully.There’s no possible bridge across this gap.

                Yeah, it’s hard to say with some of these guys. Perhaps, Rufo is a sell-out. Perhaps, he’s playing the long-game and trying to slowly move the Overton Window from the inside.
Who knows.
But I do know that he’ll never advocate for identity politics of any kind – white or otherwise – since he married an Asian and has biracial kids. Therefore, he will always fight for a colorblind, equality under the law society, and that’s a losing battle.
However, he can be useful to us at times.

                    Same for Richard Hanina, who also thinks Jews will move right, or at least the Jewish elite. While I think they may quietly give more money to Con Inc. shills like Nimrata, they (and especially their wives) will not like being associated with the anti abortion, anti gay trumpenproles waiting for the Rapture down at the local megachurch.
To the extent that Zionism becomes attached to the right, it becomes very déclassé.

                Stop trying to make “colorblind”  happen. It’s not going to happen. It’s counter to millions of years of human evolution. Only a small group of mutant Whites have sufficient outgroup preference that they allowed it to be a thing for a short period in history, and all the high in-group preference ethnicities are using it to take them to the cleaners.

            Excellent post. However, I’m not entirely sure the Finkels can shekel-whip the dusky Savonarolas into line. These august Solons can always dip their greasy paws into their inner city graft pits when they want a new Escalade or three. Jewish control of the fisc, and by extension, the teeming third world babblers, extends only so far.

        Steve Sailer had to be rushed to the emergency room for an overdose of noticing.Nah, Steverino is still trying to figure out why pedestrian deaths keep rising in the USA, and why traffic fatalities have gone up since the death of St. George of Fentanyl. ‘Tis a mystery Steve, ain’t it?(The line still made me laugh).As for the rest of it, I did like your point that the Real Chris Rufo comedically misses the point. Hey Chris, pro tip: If you’re willing to lie, cheat, steal, or ruin other people’s lives to advance yourself, you’re not going to really feelguiltyabout it if you’ve achieved success. Google “The Ends Justify the Means” and get back to us.In closing, brilliant job flooding the country with folks who hold a longtime hatred for you and bringing your old blood feuds here. Bra-vo. 👏

            The traffic deaths thing is easy.
Deaths are way up because speeds are way up and driving etiquette is way down.
Enforcement is also way down. No one in my metro area is being stopped for 20+ over, tailgating, no front plate, unreadable plates, headlights out, or illegal window tints.

                Wild Geese:  You mean Hindu and Han driving habits don’t mesh well with Latino style-driving?  Who knew?  In the DFW metro area of Texas, at least, many of the DMV workers (as well as most driving instructors and driving test supervisors) are Hindu and Han.  They enjoy failing White teens whenever possible.  And they specifically teach turning corners at a ‘safe’ speed of 10 mph, which does wonders for the flow of traffic.

                    Didn’t know the current crop of subcons were tending to be reckless drivers. The East Asian drivers I have known were pretty terrible (Koreans #1) but it didn’t present as recklessness or “exuberance” as Sailer calls it; rather I think there is a learned/innate difficulty with traffic proprioception— I’m far from Ryan Gosling myself but can still manage not to merge into parked cars. I don’t really care if some Asian college girl finds that racist, just saying we gaijin can pick up on this. And when I lived in San Antonio, headquarters of USAA (per legend started up by Army guys who couldn’t obtain car insurance otherwise), I viddied the full spectrum of Latino motor etiquette as well, which is indeed bad but not explosively so (Middle Easterners, Blacks). I think the two groups driving those conditions were the broadly Hispanic MJ aficionado segment, and the young military men (not getting high obviously, nonetheless young men with car keys).

                        DriversSpecialEd:  I didn’t say the Hindu and Han were ‘reckless,’ but they are terrible drivers nonethless.  No feel for the flow of traffic, park themselves way below the speed limit in the left lane, pulling halfway into parking lots, etc.  And the Han, in particular, are always on their phones or looking at their GPS and remain oblivious to other drivers.  And both often neglect to turn on lights at night or in the torrential rain (and the cops will never pull them over)The mestizo teens tend to drive aggressively; the squatemalan mothers drive very slowly, leary of getting a ticket and being found to have no papers (although that’s hardly a concern these days).Diversity in driving is no more beneficial than diversity in society or anything else.

        A lot of this kerfuffle revolves around what Z has called a crisis of competence. In essence, it’s hard for Jews to find good help.It’s stunning that these women were too stupid to understand their job and what they were supposed to say at the hearing. Maybe some true-believer Women’s Studies professor could be that stupid and deluded, but these women were college presidents. Their whole job is to gather money from wealthy donors, most of whom are Jewish.How could they not know what their bosses want from them?Well, they know now, and Jews are on a rampage to let the rest know that 1) we are the help and 2) our Jewish boss is going to be watching a lot harder than before for any signs that we’re not on board.

            A college President’s job is mostly to raise money, and one seriously under reported factor at work here is how much money the Ivies raise from Saudi and Gulf State sources. It probably totals in billions by now, and the schools may figure that long term, the Arabs are worth more than the Jews.
Incidentally, the Russians and the Chinese seem to have made the same calculation.

                The schools have also received some pretty big donations from rich Chinese, who know that money talks.This whole episode is a reminder that Jewish power is actually quite fragile. They have to have a complete lock on all chokepoints to elite society or their power evaporates quickly.The Wall Street Jews’ threat to blackball anyone who joins the protests only works if all the firms adhere to the plan. If a few firms tell those kids, “hey, we’ll have you,” the whole thing falls apart. It’s the same with donations.The good news is that the world is splintering. Jews don’t have a lock on global trade and finance anymore, so other countries are freeing themselves. What need now is the same thing to happen within the US.

                    “This whole episode is a reminder that Jewish power is actually quite fragile.”This is a point I frequently make. Jews are the junior partner in the Judeo-Puritan ruling class. The senior partner for whatever reason seems to have decided to take junior down a few pegs. To belabor the obvious, while obviously “our” people, the seniors also hate “their” people.There is no doubt Jewish power and influence remains extraordinary. This episode illustrates the extent. It also illustrates the limits. As you noted, that power and influence also is fragile. Both intentionally and otherwise, the Jews have been handled the cudgel to beat us down, and as a result they are hated. Our ultimate enemy is who handed them the cudgel. Destroy that enemy and this nonsense ends.

            Welp, good help IS going to be rather difficult to find among the demographics favored by the Finkels. If they really wanted bureaucracies staffed with unctuous Judeophilic lapdogs, they should be hiring white people, especially evangelical Christians. But no–their hatred of whitey burns so intensely that they refuse to do what is best for them. They prefer to burn the world down just to make absolutely certain that all of the Blue-eyed Ice Devils are incinerated in the process. They despise us even more than they worship themselves, and that is no mean feat.

        Their hatred of us is so all-consuming, that even when the story has nothing to do with us, they still find a way to tie it back to us. Look at Ryan Carson, that social justice “advocate” who got stabbed by a black kid breaking into cars in Brooklyn. The story isn’t the story, though, wherever you look. It’s how the right is basking in schadenfreude over the irony of a police defunder getting stabbed on the street. I’m sure our bemusement hurts a lot more than the holes that dindu poked in that wormy soy boy’s body. Same thing with the October 7th attack. The story isn’t then unibrows swooping down on hang gliders like flying monkeys to kill the hooknoses while they were dancing at their techno rave (that *should* be the story, as it’s quite a memorable image.) No, the story, rather, is that the attack is uniting the right, according to all the experts, while dividing the left. Forget that it’s not even true, as lots of younger normies are starting to question undying loyalty to Israel, nevermind the dissident right’s take on the issue. Everything for them is ultimately about us. They think about nothing else, ever. And even events halfway across the world involving total aliens are somehow our fault.Watching that video of Carson getting stabbed, I couldn’t help but recall what Tucker said about not wanting to be the kind of person who watches a video of a ten-on-one beatdown and celebrates, even if the victim is his enemy. That kind of principle is going to get us killed, literally—all of us—sooner rather than later. The “Boer Killers” in South Africa don’t have the same kind of logistical, institutional, and financial support that the antiwhite cohort enjoys in America.Z’s right. Skynet’s live and machines don’t fight fair.

This is only half true. In spite of kvetching and claims, there is no credible evidence of mass rape, just like there’s no credible evidence of 40 beheaded babies or pedal-powered masturbation machines.
I do, however, have it on good authority that the skin of those gyrating Jewesses was made into some pretty fine lampshades…which were also raped…possibly by a bear and eagle.

        I know your use of “nuanced” is tongue-in-cheek, but it’s just shocking how they pretend that there is nuance to the genocidal chants of their radical students while any poster with an implicitly pro-white message is an existential danger to every minority on campus. It’s a toss-up whether it’s a “they’re lying and they know they’re lying” situation or if they are really this dumb. I used to think that to get that high up, one had to have at least some brain cells, but we’re entering a situation where they might really be that dumb.https://www.harvard.edu/president/speeches/2023/courage-to-be-harvard/“Why? is a question that comes to us early in life. If you know a young child, you know this well: Why are we here? Why is the moon out during the day? Why can’t I eat ice cream for breakfast? Why is she talking so much? We may be tempted to stop asking why when we accept the default answers around us, until something sparks us to question those answers.Harvard has always been a place to ask Why? It animates our research and teaching.”That is an actual quote, from a prepared speech, of the president of the most prestigious university in our nation. The rest is no better, and sounds like something out of High School, Just baffling.

            Just as the White Right has no dog in the Gaza War, we have none in cat-fights between Jewish plutocrats and affirmative action Ivy League presidents. They best we can hope for in both cases is that they kill one another off or otherwise inflict manifold mutual harms.

        As seen on Xitter, behind the tall gates of many Ivory Towers, tenured professors are sweating bullets knowing that in a few months/years it’s going to be trivially easy for “AI” to scan their papers for plagiarism.
There’s either going to be general amnesty or their research papers will be put  under lock and key (like Obama’s college work) only accessible to “true academics.”
I wonder what unleashing AI on Xirl Science would reveal?

        “And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.”
On the bright side, it takes your participation— you have to lay down. Or, from the Christian perspective, climb up on the cross.
God sacrificed Himself to Himself to fulfill that insane part of the Law— the perpetual debt paid in blood. SO YOU DON’T HAVE TO (to the dumbasses out there). Judeo-Christianity, lol.

        When the wicked fight among themselves the good rejoice. The really interesting thing is whether little hat and migration jihad can paper over this fracture. The rift is deeper than ever before since 1973. Jews are genuinely spooked. And the destruction in Gaza is said to resemble that of Germany in WW2. I’m not so sure they can just go back to hating whitey. I think the scene has moved a little, to our advantage

Something in their nature, perhaps DNA, compels this hatred. That long with several other things (pettiness, vindictiveness, ego) I once thought were just stereotypes about them really have surfaced with this incident.

        I’m not so sure TPTB “hate us and want us dead”. It’s a good rallying line for our side, but it’s exaggerated and untrue.What we’re seeing is steam being let off – the daily churn of the permanent revolution coupled with the innumerate interest groups that TPTB have to handle does come to a boiling point now and then. Steam must be released. Because white people aren’t allowed to stick up for each other as an interest or and ethny, they get targeted. The weakest always gets targeted. Or, as in the case of white people, the group that allows itself to be steamrolled, will be steamrolled.They don’t hate us; in fact I think they are grateful that white people are as magnanimous and altruistic as we can be, and willing to ignore that which is in front of our noses. (The “naive white person” that I hear about all the time in my travels.) We are their punching bag; their living stress ball. We will take our lickswhilekeeping the country going, assured that hate and injustice will fade away with each successive managerial crisis. We’re like that slightly dumb blond jock archetype who goes 100% for each play, even though our team is losing badly.This all ends tomorrow when white people start sticking up for themselves as an ethny. Which, by the way, is happening. It’s not gone mainstream yet, but it will, as long as Elon keeps the lights on at Twitter.

Marko is correct in the sense that (((TPTB))) are grateful that we’re such chumps, and that gratitude rather confounds the hatred. But you are right from the standpoint that, in their heart of hearts, deep down inside, the really do hate us. The reasons for that hatred are multifarious, complex and ancient.

            As a noticer, I’m going to go with “they hate us and want us dead.” Sure, things will fall apart, but that’s not stopping their ongoing crusade of replacing Whites everywhere.  After all, they do have an established record of not exactly thinking things through.A recent example shows that since the BLM riots, Fortune 500 companies have hired 94 percent minorities.  Only 6 percent White males.Anyone looking forward to flying once the White male pilots have been replaced?  United has announced they will no longer hire White males.  They aren’t thinking about the consequences of Whitey no longer being there.

                We see “replacement” and they see “correction”. I agree that we are being replaced, but I guarantee you every white, especially those in power, or at a Fortune 500 company, thinks that diversity is great, or is just looking out for himself or herself and doesn’t want to rock the mental boat with “right-wing” ideas. Especially w.r.t. IQ.The upper white class, part of “they who hate us”, have a great gift for intellectualizing everything (to lift a term from psychology) and they are intellectualizing our demise. Whites are great builders and awesome destroyers. Now we are in our destructive phase. It is not J*ws or brown people that hate us; it is whites who are going through a natural cycle of destruction per the end result of novel ideas. Rome (via citizenship), the Christian church (via universalism), now Liberalism (via egalitarianism).

            There’s an “excited utterance” exception to the hearsay rule. Basically it holds that people don’t lie when they’re surprised. When surprised by “Brexit and Trump,” what did our enemies say?Judged by their spontaneous ejaculations—and their considered declarations, too, but those are less trustworthy—the average regime enjoyer (Democratic voter) hates the statistically average American more than the most vulgar, retarded “nazi” hates the most stereotypical Jew. And their hatred is a softly blurred reflection of their leaders’, the media’s, “the culture’s,” etc.But yes, they are grateful to us, thankful that we are what we are. Victim magnanimity heightens the sadist’s pleasure.

        Nuance generally does not work except in the groves of academe. In the public sphere, with the people generally and their tribunes, everything has to be black or white. St. George of Fentanyl good, Chauvin bad. Ukraine good, Russia bad. Biden good, Putin evil. Israel good, Hamas bad. The Jewish overlords and their paid prostitutes (the politicians) need to keep the public at this infantile level of development, of seeing everything as good or bad, black or white. Everything needs to be shoe-horned into one of two categories. If you don’t like Biden you must be pro-Putin. Nuance is thought crime in Oceania.In this case nuance means seeing that the protestors might actually have legitimate arguments on their side. That an unwarranted genocide is taking place. That the Hamas attack did not come out of nowhere. That the Zionists make the Nazis look like weak sisters. But this is heresy in the GAE.

        Ah, I LOVE this…it’s about all you can do not to laugh.I do think these little flaps are good for ‘the cause’ in general – like seeing Las Vegas in the sober morning light to see that it’s all just a ruse and the Bellagio is just a Super 8 with some better wall paper. Every crack in the facade, no matter how small is a tiny win, chipping away at the myths of the Clouds.And that bridge over the battlefield to the moral high ground does a wonderful job of helping escape the real questions. Not the questions that the ridiculous lady is a fraud, that can be assumed up front without evidence, but the questions of how many people saw this fraud behind closed doors and kept hiring/promoting her anyway.Those questions start to unravel a lot of other modern myths. Take for instance PhD’s. They have to present that thesis to a board of others whose sole purpose is to validate the work. Things like scientific rigor, plagiarism, etc. So the PhD process is either completely inept to stop these frauds or knowingly promotes them. Hmm. How about these hiring committees at all of the ‘prestigious’ institutions along the way? They either were inept to uncover the fraud or knowingly promoted it. Hmm.How many of these stack up to get her where she is now? How many others frauds are elevated in the same manner?

            Hey, it was good enough for MLK, it should be good enough for President Sheboon.
If they were able to do the work on their own, they would.
They can’t, so they do what they do.
Related to this, I was required to write a thesis for my Masters degree.
The first attempt was roundly rejected by my old, white instructor/mentor/friend.
He said “I know you can do better than that.” So I did.
It was the most difficult academic task I ever did, and in retrospect, I’m glad how it unfolded.

            It’s an axiom of life in AINO that 97 percent of negroes in positions of power got there through social promotion, not via their own intellectual candle-power and work ethic. It is also true that the asinine propagation of inept negroes undermines the credibility of every institution engaging in this process. And, for all intents and purposes, there is not an institution in AINO that doesn’t.

        I too am enjoying seeing this cartoonish expose of the fraud of merit-based selection at our so-called most elite universities.  This weekend, I found myself thinking–what is the probability that these three institutions all have girl bosses? If it is merit based it would be very low.  Patterns can be funny and persistent.  So, I did some research and find that of the eight Ivy league schools, six have women presidents and two have white guys.  Judging by surnames, it appears that the two white guys are jews.  It appears that four of the girl bosses are jews, one is black (and I agree, ridiculous looking) and one was (past tense because she was the one who was fired) a white gentile.

        If the schnozolas want to pull back their contributions, so what?  All three of those vaunted, elite institutions have multi-billion dollar endowments that’ll never be spent down in multi generations.  That said, the “go gurl” fiasco is funny as hell.  The old White babe gets the proverbial axe, the ugly, plagerizing black female gets raked over the coals, but the administrative and academic schmucks there back her up.  The jew girl at MIT curiously is hardly mentioned – surprise, surprise.  This former country is nothing but a bad joke at this point.

            Have to laugh at the naivete (affected or real) of some people celebrating that Harvard “lost 1 billion”. Like these transactions happen in a day. This seems like a show for boomers and boomer-like brains. No money will be withheld after they cave (or are forced to cave).If we had a proper journalist we should find how the whole endowment system works. Would not be surprised if Harvard uses it to pay favors while the money is parked in a tax exempt fund until it can be deployed. I don’t think they want to use the money to pay for tuitions.

                Harvard’s endowment is over 50 billion.  So they should be able to make that “lost” billion back with a couple good trades.
But maybe not.  Their returns haven’t been very good lately probably because their ESG rules prevent them from investing in anything profitable.

        May I simply point out that conservative ‘tards such as Rufo are evidence for my assertion a few days ago: Normie conservatives will not abandon the Republicans no matter how hard they (intentionally vague pronoun reference) are embarrassed. This diversity hire plagiarized anti-white rhetoric and is still at the top of the totem pole in academia, and the conservatives think they “won” because her fraud is exposed. This is the exact same behavior when the Right believes they win because they point out the hypocrisy of the Left.  Insanity.Again, watch how conservative gatekeepers always try to amaze their audience with the assertion that conservatives are on the cusp of some great victory, and watch how many cattle are amazed as a result. This buzzing anxiety is not that dissimilar to global warming anxiety – whereas one feels the imminent arrival of Armageddon, another feels the imminent arrival of New Jerusalem. Same disease, slightly different symptom.Abandon all hope…

            I disagree. This will be the last election in which the Republicans are nationally viable. It may not be abandonment as much as neglect. Those voters in ever larger numbers will stay home. I’m torn as to which outcome is of more benefit, but barring Trump from the ballot certainly would accelerate the move toward willful neglect.

                I have to disagree, sir. Consider our culture. For at least a decade, Normie has had the opportunity to learn that the liberals do not fear the claim of hypocrisy. And yet, that is all the conservative still screams in practice.Note the narrative for Normie: the main concern is that the Harvard president plagiarized, and they have caught her! She didn’t embrace Israel! She didn’t live up to the standards she should.Note what is not the narrative: some NASA is president of one of our (supposedly) greatest institutions. The system has installed a subpar ghoul.The former embraces the system; the latter scorns it. Note which one Normie has and continues to flock to. The nonviability of Republican candidates is far less dire and consequential to the actual “lived experience” (I hate that term – what else is experience except lived)than the nonviability of white candidates to positions of power. And yet, despite having their noses rubbed in it for over a decade, and increasingly being told they cannot note it, most work even harder now to justify the system.For the fanatic, defeat is no repudiation.

                    Great comment but I still disagree. It only takes about five percent staying home to take out the GOP permanently. They are there. Even more given recent actions, they themselves fully realize this is their last hoorah. They are openly siding with the Left against their putative constituents. This is to be celebrated, to be clear, since the phenomenon you describe is quite real but well past its expiry date. All cults have deadenders, of course, but that doesn’t allow survival. We’ll compare notes in about a year.

        Short term it does not matter and should be savored, yes. But this also indicates that long term the madness is unsustainable in its present form and geographic area. Great damage has been done to and will continue to be done to our people until then, but the demons will not prevail.As for the present and in this case the interim, mark this: Israel is done. I do not think this is necessarily an unalloyed good thing, either, as the present diaspora is full of destructive individuals and increasing their number will make that worse. Still, the last protector of the Zionist entity also is full of people who want to see it ended for the same reason they want to see whites ended. Israel is just a more intelligent high-end African nation dependent upon the charity of others.Domestically, the Coalition of the Fringes–never viable–has been thrown into permanent turmoil. They may have a common enemy but they really do hate one another. And that common enemy has seen clearly how the Coalition’s senior but doddering partner chooses who rules over them (is there a more ludicrous public figure than Mike Johnson?). My guess is at least one faction will transition from caucus to ethnic party in the near-term. A good candidate is Hispanics. La Raza del Norte, anyone? If and when this happens we should send them dinero.It touches on a hobby horse of mine and hopefully not a product of wishful thinking, but tension in the Coalition will lead to further Balkanization, dissolution, and fragmentation, which is in fact well underway. That, of course, is a good thing.As for that lady boss at Harvard, she will get the treatment in due time. The aged rattlesnakes she has riled up are known for biting long after they are kicked, and continue to have a few friends still embedded in high places that can make it happen after a decent interval. Again, we can enjoy the show.The blackpill is we have to endure this environment because some of our own people didn’t like us and actually themselves. They should look at the white lady at UPenn as a cautionary tale.

            Yes, the Jewish brains behind the Left have finally had to choose between Leftist “principles” and Israeli blood and soil nationalism. And – of course! Who would blame them? – they have chosen the latter.Ditto those supporting Palestine – another blood and soil state!

        I really enjoy the whole plagiarism thing. Anyone who has been in academia, undergrad thru PhD, knows how it works. There’s simply no way that’s an honest mistake. Those aren’t ooopsies. By the time you get out of your first Graduate seminar, footnoting every substantive claim is just second nature. What she did is just breathtakingly blatant.
Nothing will come of it, of course, but it amuses me, and like you say, take joy where you find it — especially in the enemy’s discomfiture.

            It is why academic writing is pretty much unreadable. It is littered with foot and end notes to the point where you wonder if the writer is being paid by Superscript Inc. Frankly, it is ridiculous. So yeah, not only did she have to know, she also knew that you get extra credit for the mentions. Her advisors also knew the deal too.The plagiarism charge gets recklessly tossed around like the racism and antisemitism charges, but in the academy, they have very clear rules and customs about this stuff, so it is a different thing. If she did copy and paste from others without attribution, there is no way it was an accident and there is no way her advisors did not know it.

                My only exposure to this was my honors thesis 40 years ago.  Had to be fully compliant with grad school/scholarly publication rules.  Writing it was relatively easy compared to checking/re-checking all the text for proper citations form and content.  This was not an accident. And the era of manual typing.

                Plagiarism also comes back on your adviser in a big way, and since academia is a very small pond you’re not just ruining your own reputation, but your adviser’s, too. And the adviser will get called on it, face to face, at the next professional conference. “How dare you let your student do that?!?” Careers have been ruined that way. But I guess that’s the choice they made — admit that this negress has no business getting a PhD, or rubber stamp her through. Either way it’s career suicide if you’re caught, so I guess pick the one you’re less likely to get caught doing and cross your fingers….

                        No question about it. It is practically impossible that a mentor–let alone one with tenure–would be defenestrated for advancing social justice by rubber-stamping a black imbecile. Far more likely that he would be labeled a racist for not doing so and lose his job thereby.

                        Oh, AND she won the “Toppan Prize for Best Dissertation in Political Science” for that thing, so not only did her committee fail to recognize that it was plagiarized, so did the prize jury.
Again, that is pretty much impossible. They either a) didn’t read it, or b) didn’t care, or c) all of the above.
I guess we now know the answer to the dilemma “Tell me you are the Affirmative Action hire to end all Affirmative Action hires without using the words.”

                        “ …not only did her committee fail to recognize that it was plagiarized, so did the prize jury.”  SeverianHell, even in the Computer Science department, we fed writings and programs into a service that reported on plagiarism.  The report would come back with notated lines that were found in writings elsewhere—even when those lines were subtly changed!Hard to imagine that even in ‘98 (infancy of the technology for this process) this service would not have been able to detect Gay’s plagiarism, which from the excerpts I’ve seen elsewhere was amateurish, but massive.As to the CV, we see exactly what you decry—advanced degrees awarded in pseudo sciences.  I maintain that all of these pseudo sciences were created for two reasons:  1) to increase minority graduation rates, 2) to increase general student enrollment and thereby “milk” tuition from children of gullible parents.We used to call the such institutions “degree mills” back in the day.  But that was another time and place, now they (not for profit colleges and universities) are all degree mills I guess.

                Great article today. I think the best insight was the point about celebrating, “the own”, as opposed to the fact that she ever got there and what enabled it.That lies in this comment thread as well. What is missed in the focus on the plagiarism is what it is that she was plagiarizing. Rufo is a dingbat for focusing not just on the plagiarism but that it is plagiarism of anti-white, anti-Occidental vitriol and nonsense. This is classic, “conservative”, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.Celebrate taking one person down for plagiarism and instead passing on a golden opportunity to show that all of these girl bosses oversee institutions that are anti-white to their core. It is in their writings, it is in their admissions practices, it is in their alumni’s words and deeds.It doesn’t matter. Now white women who have half an instinct for self preservation have been shown what lies behind the curtain. The UPenn lady won’t do anything with it. She’ll grovel and do her best to get plugged back into the matrix.What is important is that now, somewhere out there are more people of quality, the only people who matter, who have seen The Wizard.

                I recently had a PhD lift some of my analysis and publish it internationally as her firm’s product, with no attribution.  When I contacted her/them to complain, she feigned ignorance – which is ridiculous for the reasons Severian noted. PhD doesn’t mean what it used to.

                    I have had my copy here lifted a few times by somewhat famous people. They made a few changes, but it was obvious they were using me as a source they dare not mention. In other cases, people have noted other writers borrowing my ideas or framing without attribution.I am of a mixed mind on this. On the one hand, it could be accidental. Casual writing has lower standards and is not intended to be original scholarship, so you cannot expect people to go through the effort to make sure they are not quoting another without attribution. I am sure I have used lines that others can claim credit without knowing where I heard it.On the other hand, it is nice to be noticed, but that will never happen for me so I do not think about too much. This is where you see the difference between a professional writer and an activist writer. The former makes a living from words, while the later is seeking to change minds. If in the end I change some minds, but am forgotten, I can live with that.

That’s a beautiful way to frame this phenomenon. It is very likely no one will know who, say, Jared Taylor was in 50 years but with any luck the ideas he espoused will have achieved at least partial fruition. If that happens, the victors will stand on the shoulders of unknown giants.

                        When we both commented at NRO years ago, it was clear that their contributors were pillaging the comments section for good ideas.  After the 4th or 5th time it happened I started writing in away that would make it easier to spot.  Like you, I’m happy if my thought change minds or elevate ideas.  So I didn’t mind too much.Over time, though, it became apparent that NR was utterly devoid of intelligent people with interesting ideas.  And they needed the actual intelligent people in the comments section to keep things going.Conservative Treehouse is another place that sees its comments section get pillaged.  Not by the owners, but by third parties lurking in the comments.

                            I remember those days. The quality of the writing collapsed at NR when they began to restrict comments too. It is why I try to read all the comments here, especially the criticism. It keeps me on my toes. But, you have to be willing to take criticism, which is clearly not the case at most of these sites.

                    RabbiHighComma:  Many years ago I worked for a Korean multiational company that had just established its first ‘liaison’ (proto-lobbying) office in the US.  I would accompany the head guy to meetings and interviews with various US government officials and write up very extended accounts of these meetings, complete with various notes and side info on the subject matter.  I would also research and write reports on various other trade and manufacturing issues.My Korean boss would translate these reports into Korean and submit them, under his name, to the head office.  He received quite a few kudos for all his work and information.  There was no ill intent on his part – that’s just how his system worked.  I worked for him so he took credit for whatever I ‘produced.’  I find it quite funny, in hindsight.

                        “…that’s just how his system worked. I worked for him so he took credit for whatever I ‘produced.’ I find it quite funny, in hindsight.”Korean?  Not a problem.  They seem to take both credit and *accept* blame–even where no Westerner would attribute such to them.Remember the Korean boat accident a number of years ago that wiped out a Korean HS class on a trip?  The boat captain (not on duty at the time–gotta sleep right?) committed suicide over the shame of the accident. Guess you don’t have to sleep.Why? Because the captain is “responsible” for everybody (crew) under his command! Then the HS trip organizer committed suicide.  Why?  Because he chartered the boat! Guess he should have had some sort of psychic powers to foretell the future. He was even farther removed from blame.Korea is a shame culture.  But not America.  Here at my old university, they just announced a $285M revenue shortfall–bad investments.  Not a word of anyone being fired, much less the President who is paid $1.5M for his sage guidance of the institution. Instead, an austerity program is being instituted to punish the rank and file staff and raise fess to the students and public. Screw/punish everyone *except* those responsible–that’s the American way.Is this a great country or what (says no one these days)?

                Nope. Not in my experience. I don’t know how they roll in Political Science, but in my semi-adjacent field (History) you will get dinged pretty much automatically if you have more than a few paragraphs without a footnote.That’s not because of scrupulous attention to scholarly ethics, mind you, but because your dissertation is also a sustained exercise in ring-kissing. You find yourself citing the self-evident, just so you can get quotes in from the proper Scriptural Authorities. I had some fun with it, because I’m a jerk like that — I’d write things like “The English Civil War was, in Michel Foucault’s incisive phrase, ‘important&#x27;” — but that’s not really too far off from how it actually goes.Moreover, the stuff she plagiarized in her dissertation was background material. In other words, it’s stuff any competent adviser should recognize right away. It should get returned automatically with a note: “It sounds like you’re drawing from the work of [big name, easily recognizable scholar] here. Be sure to include the appropriate citations.”She knew she was plagiarizing. If her committeedidn’tknow, they either didn’t read the thing, or didn’t care (or both, of course).

I admit it’s not likely, few doctoral advisors allow such latitude of their enslaved disciples (i.e., doctoral student).

                        I would imagine an advantage of pseudo-scientific research is there is no actual knowledge available. However, this doesn’t mean the committee is incapable of noticing long passages of background material do not have citations (pace Severian). My guess is this was ignored intentionally, and the assumption was it would not be caught, which would have been true if the Tribe had not been angered. A mere white Gentile is not permitted to point out a Holy Person’s plagiarism. Also, we no longer can wave off retardation, even (especially?) at Harvard.

                    That’s quite right. The committee members would have been exceptionally well read in the literature she plagiarized. In fact, it is probable that much of the plagiarized text came from works the committee members assigned to her in preparation for her comprehensive exams. You can be dam’ sure that if she was using long stretches of these works verbatim, the committee members would have recoginized it. That being the case, it’s quite clear the committee members were aware of the plagiarism and couldn’t care less. Thus, the malfeasance radiates not only from the author but from those whose job it was to supervise her work.

            Don’t forget, when the boss lady with the weird glasses gets to keep her job, which she is keeping and will keep, that means she is right, correct, proper in all things, and the rest of us are wrong.  Or she wouldn’t still have her job, Ipso facto.
Leftie is great at shifting the successful exercise of pure power into some sort of twisted moral lesson for the rest of us.

            As an undergrad, I had drafts of papers returned if I didn’t cite the source of every single claim, and they were thoroughly checked. I’m supposed to believe a thesis advisor for a PhD wouldn’t be more strict?
Nowadays, pretty much every paper is run through a program that tags any and everything that isn’t cited.

                It is one of the first things you notice when you start noticing things.  Even some normies who try not to notice things are aware of it.  Granted I saw a clip this morning of Rep Jim Hines wanting to justify giving Ukraine another blank check by saying, “no one in Allied leadership questioned Churchill’s plan in WWII.”  He is Harvard educated and was a Rhodes Scholar.  When most of the people in the room are almost of dumb as Gay, it may not be as noticeable to her.

                        I just saw a short clip where he makes the comment during a floor speech. He doesn’t elaborate beyond “we stood by him because he stood for liberty,” and appears to believe no one in the Allied command ever questioned Churchill.  He must completely buy into the Zelensky is the new Churchill narrative the Kagan Cult was pushing at the beginning of this war.

                        Field Marshal Brooke’s diaries are full of clashes with Sir Winston. Churchill had some good insights, such as the promoting the invasion infrastructure that would be needed, as the tragic Dieppe Raid showed. Then there was his promotion–literally and figuratively–of Monty’s brother-in-law, General Hobart, whose command of an assortment of Sherman and Churchill tank-based “sapper” vehicles propelled British and Canadian troops over the beaches and across flooded rivers without appalling losses. But “Brookie” knew that the Wehrmacht couldn’t be commando-raided or dam-busted into defeat. Systematic effort would be required. As the war was raging, Brooke mused that he didn’t know where Britain would be without Churchill, but he admitted that he didn’t know where his country was headed WITH him.

        Watching this whole fiasco unfold has been about the most fun you can have with your pants still on.  And one where one can happily hope both lose.  The miscalculation here is not understanding the hedge fund/private equity guys.  They are the lizard guys running the pirate ship economy, so will happily fund all this nonsense…until there is the suggestion that they should be burned in an oven.  Then will turn all that reptilian fury on you.  I know Ackman by one degree of separation and triggering a guy like that was a big boo-boo.  He (and his fellows) pick fights like this for a living.

                Follow the proxy fight game for a while and you’ll see it has a lot of back/forths.  Ackman and his ilk are masters at this.  And of opening multiple fronts.  Ackman did that by opening a new one against the investment group—frankly pointing out the blithering idiocy of the investment committee with a gift he gave them years ago.  And now you are also getting glimpse of the strings attached to many of these massive gifts that allow them to be clawed back even though are counted to the current endowment.

It’s like with politics: everyone has dirt in their timeline, so you can always nail anyone who requires nailing. We own your ass, so sing from the hymn sheet and you won’t get outed.

It’s only “meaningless” if you expect it to lead to real knowledge, but it most definitely has meaning as a tool for pushing degeneracy on society.

True. One of my professors used to say that if you copy from one source, it’s plagiarism. If you copy from two sources (and are careful to cite them), then it’s scholarship.

                I copied one source and credited two others, carefully omitting the first guy from my endnotes. When I wasn’t plagiarizing myself, that is.
Worked like a charm. Left you a lot of time for partying.

                Reminds me of when I was finishing my degree many moons ago and I’d follow citations only to find that the cited source didn’t make the point asserted or, less common but still noticeable, didn’t mention it at all, like the author just used a random citation generator to find a book with a title that might contain the point he was trying to make.
I’d mentioned that to an academic buddy and he was like “yeah, you’ll get that”.

                        From time to time I will chase down references in a text and nine times out of ten there is no way to locate the source online or if I do find it the passage has nothing to do with the claim. It is why I hate notations. They are pointless.

Most of these quotes, I imagine, are generated when some guy cribs the sources from some youtuber who claims that: “wind power is now cheaper than coal”, except they don’t actually bother to read the link themselves.
Me: “Please give me a source for your claim that the vax has killed 20% of New Zealand’s population.”

            As I said in another comment. the plagiarism charge gets tossed around recklessly. If two people observe the same things and write about it, there should be similarities, even if they are unaware of one another entirely. There are only so many ways to say things. That said, you get extra points for referencing the work of others in the academy. The more footnotes the better, so there is a very strong incentive to credit others, even when the credit is not warranted. Every thesis reviewer, paper reviewer and book reviewer first looks to see if he is mentioned, quoted or there is a link to his work.

                Having had the dubious pleasure of being cited in dissertations and such — and yeah, of course I look, I’m only human — I can tell you how it goes for a workaday fellow (that is, I’m nobody’s idea of a big, important, trendy intellectual, so works that cite me are usually pretty close to the tiny field I worked in).Of 10 citations, 1-3 are correct and germane — I said what they said I said, and it’s relevant to the argument they’re making.Another 1-3 seem to be just padding. One of those footnotes that says “See also,” and then lists everyone who has ever written anything anywhere close to the citing author’s field.The remainder are all WTF. Either I didn’t say what they said I said, or I said the exact opposite of what they said I said, or what I said has no bearing at all on what they’re currently saying. Just bizarre. I have no idea how those happen, but they do. A lot.

                    Padding is valuable to researchers, however, insofar as it helps you find other scholars who have written on subjects germaine to your own field. It’s sort of a scholarly courtesy to other researchers.

        At this point I’m past the point of caring about what happens in cloud people land. The only thing keeping them together is the hated White man, but with Whitey refusing to play the part of hostile enemy and going full ethno nationalist they don’t really have a foil to focus on. At this point I believe most of the insanity we see today is just a provocation to get a response from us, so they can unite and crack down.It’s as if the brainwashing to keep us from rising up has the unintended result of causing them to instead turn on each other.
