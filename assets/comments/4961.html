        If you looked into the TFR rates in most of those European countries, you will find that the Muslim and African immigrants are contributing considerably more than their flaccid hosts.
The point of no return has been passed.
It is not just the demographics, but the wilful indifference of the political, administrative, journalistic and general chattering classes which makes it so.

        Doomsday report, ugh.  It does however give me an inspiration for a screenplay to counter this horrid turn of events.  I’ve said for years that a good old fashioned World War (total war) would be a good re-set button.

        The demographic collapse is probably irreversible, but things may not go quite so quietly into that good night.  From last Friday:Headline: Violent clashes break out in Rome as Italian opposition to migrants increases“Violent protests against refugees broke out in Rome on Friday, hours after locals in the northern city of Treviso forced the evacuation of a group of migrants by burning mattresses and furniture.Protesters clashed with truncheon-wielding riot police in the suburb of Casale San Nicola on the outskirts of Rome as a group of 19 refugees were driven under police escort to a former school that has been converted into a migrant reception centre.At least 14 police officers were hurt in the clashes, which came amid a growing backlash against the 84,000 refugees and asylum seekers who have arrived in Italy this year after crossing the Mediterranean in boats and dinghies operated by people smugglers based in Libya.That is on top of the 170,000 who reached Italian shores last year. ”http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/11747106/Violent-clashes-break-out-in-Rome-as-Italian-opposition-to-migrants-increases.html

        Quite a bloodless coup, setting up the EU. In Europe’s bad old days one had to kill a lot of people (or more accurately, persuade others to kill a lot of people on one’s behalf) to rule Europe. But we now have unelected ‘leaders’ running Europe who simply made themselves available for grandness. No one outflanked, no tanks rolling over piles of dead… all harmony and love with some people at the top congratulating themselves on begin in the right place at the right time to become top dog. (Or top hund, or top chien or worryingly, top kalb.)I do think that Europe isn’t bothered so much about reproducing because everyone knows there is no point. The people who eagerly threw open the borders to thousands of unskilled and largely uneducated immigrants have got the message through in a very subtle way: don’t bother having babies, Europeans, because Europe’s future rulers won’t want your race around anyway.By the way, UK news recently featured supposedly ‘feel good’ stories of British warships helping immigrants from Africa to reach Europe (and, without it being said, replace white Europeans and their culture). I presume, though this is never explained, that such aid was done in international waters. In which case why wasn’t the intervention to save Africans in small, crowded boats from a watery grave by our ships done facing the opposite way so these people could be returned safely to their natural habitat? I presume Britain’s shrinking navy still has steering that can point the ship in directions other than European ports, so hauling a few thousand Africans out of the briny and taking them back to African ports would be better than saying, in effect, it’s okay to try to get to Europe because we will make it easier for you.
