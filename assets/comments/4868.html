        This topic is so necessary for “dieters” to understand. In order to make these low-fat “foods” more palatable, the food industry added massive amounts of sugars (mostly in the form of high fructose corn syrup). When you add the highly refined and processed carbs to the added sugars this reaks havoc on insulin levels. The inevitable result is the diabetes epidemic we are now experiencing.

        Actually, margarine has been around a lot longer than the low-fat scare, and it’s original attraction was simply cost: a pound of margarine in 1950 was about 1/3 the price of a  pound of butter.Which led to some interesting machinations -none of which would have been possible pre-FDR and war ration boards- by governmental regulatory agencies who had been captured by the dairy industry. Since margarine, in its native form, is simply white, marketing it to the consumer as a butter substitute required it the be colored with yellow food dye. The “red dye #2 scare” was just a gleam in a bureaucrats eye at that point, but the dairy industry made do with what they had, and had their gov’t lackeys declare that dyeing it yellow was “false advertising”.The margarine producers were quick on their feet, though, and, in states where this ban was implemented, simply added a pouch with the yellow dye in it, and the customer kneaded the dye through it.I remember this because I was the one designated to do the kneading for my family. We weren’t poor (at least, we didn’t think of ourselves that way- especially given the tales from parents, et al, about being really poor during the depression) but butter wasn’t in the budget if there was something almost as good and a lot cheaper.

        Apparently the Atlantic did not employ editors in 1989.

        This attitude towards animal fat comes not from science, but from the 19th century Victorian attitude toward eating meat. Some religious reformers and feminists thought eating meat made people more aggressive, particularly men. One of the social goals of the time was to make men more docile, so Seventh Day Adventism required vegetarianism, and Mormonism encouraged meat consumption to be kept to a minimum.
The extreme of this was Dr. Kellogg, who abhorred sex and thought the key to health was his cereal. It’s wacky but true, they even made a comedy about him, “The Road to Wellville”.

            I’ve always sense that at the heart of diet fads and health fads lies good old fashioned self-denial. If it feels good, don’t do it! The default assumption is that if it tastes good, it must be bad for you. Alcohol consumption is the most obvious example. You have to be a monstrous drunk to wreck your liver. I’ve known men who drank heavily their whole lives without having alcohol related problems. Churchill is the most famous example. But, even moderate alcohol consumption is assumed to be bad.
