        I don’t know who’s better than who, but there are other women.

        Has anyone implied it is anything other than marketing? I always assumed she was the best female driver – so they threw her in to make things interesting. My beef would be if she is worse than other female drivers but she was chosen for her looks.

        NASCAR is just a marketing company, race tracks are giant billboards and the race is just a tv commercial. The Petty family knows this and they’re just playing the “heel” to create drama.

        She is not bad at racing cars. She is better at racing cars than 99.999 percent of the U.S. population. What’s wrong with throwing a woman into the competition to make a dull “sport” more interesting? As long as she is better than the worst male driver I don’t have an issue with her racing.

            But, no one is paying to see me drive to work. The fact that she is a better race car driver than me is irrelevant. What matters is how she does against her peers, which is not very good. Again, if she had a penis, she is struggling to keep a ride and very well may never have been given the chance. There’s nothing wrong with it, but there’s nothing right about it either, in the moral sense. The folks trying to get grace on the cheap by “supporting” her should look elsewhere. It is just a marketing trick. Nothing more.
