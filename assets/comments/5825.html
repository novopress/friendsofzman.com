        Here in Southern California we wear shorts all the time, all year round.  Of course, it’s 70 degrees year round, too.  I was at the grocery store last winter after a workout and was wearing shorts and a hoodie (it was about 55 degrees, a cold spell, for sure), and a couple who were new to the area (I live in a college town, and they obviously students there) commented to me about my choice of garb.  Shorts all year, baby.We also have those rolling road blocks – either Asian women in a fancy car or a fat Mexican woman in a mini-van.

        I’ve driven extensively round the northeast as well, and the worst offending states when it comes to the rolling roadblock are, in descending order, are New York, Connecticut, and Ohio.  Dishonorable mention goes to Maryland.I suspect that the infamous State Troopers in these states (especially New York) — more properly known as armed Revenue Agents — have the citizenry so beat down that they don’t have any understanding of traffic flow or lane discipline at all any more.  It’s been replaced with cruise control abuse.But, don’t get me started on cars and driving — I won’t get any work done at all today.

        WTF are you guys doing watching other dudes? You don’t have girls where you roam? I have NO tattoos, NO tank tops, Broad shouldered &amp; NEITHER fat NOR harry, and wear the same comfy cotton button down shirts with cotton shorts year round.Had some contract work requiring travel to snow country during the winter with hrs on the plane &amp; a couple more driving in a rental car in the freeze. My normal garb is most comfortable for the long trip and they make up for a slight discomfort in the rental car parking lot and entry into a motel. Only ONCE in countless such trips did I wish I’d taken a casual coat cuz I had to change a tire in 0deg weather. ONE TIME with only a dress coat unsuitable for tire changing.Feel free to look at my legs, my shoulders or whatever causes you to stare at men and barf or suffer however male-nuts suffer looking at other men. FU! Every where I go, there’s a pretty girl there to keep me happy. I don’t even notice you, unless you say hello and add some entertaining chat. Men can be funny as hell, usually more so than women.

        Yes, those rolling roadblock guys.  There’s the “timid passer”, too.  This is the person who pulls into the left lane to pass a very long tractor trailer.  But the act of changing lanes seems to exhaust his stock of courage, and so he can’t bring himself to hit the gas to go faster.  He ends up hovering next to the truck, going maybe 2 mph faster, which means it take him about 3 miles to finally pass wheeled behemoth.  Meanwhile, you’re behind him, in the shadow of the truck, and with its engine roaring right beside you.

            In Illinois, the trucks do this constantly.  One of these days I’m going to pass both of them on the shoulder, and then be the rolling roadblock myself.  No one will mourn my passing.

        Here in Jersey, we have a law that says “Keep Right Except To Pass”. Our fair state is full of people we politely call Left Lane Richards, or Dicks, if you will. Left Lane Dick will tootle along in the passing lane at or below the posted speed limit, oblivious to the traffic around him. I submit, the mines are too kind for some.Please, come to NJ once enthroned.

        People who buy savage dogs but never train or exercise them meaning whenever I walk past I have a half-inch piece of spruce between a me and a psychotic beast.
People who don’t just throw their cigarette butts out the car window but the whole empty packet.
Park goers who decide to break out the frisbee in a crowded play area.
People parking on the line deliberately taking up 2 parking spots.

        I live in Maryland, and you are so right about the rolling roadblock. I stick to the right, and there are many times I want to pass when I see someone coming up at a higher rate of speed. I wait for them and when they catch up they slow down and match speed in the next lane over, and just sit there.Also I’ve noticed that the inappropriate dress guy is a fat, hairy guy in a tank top (UK vest).

            That is a maddening thing. I should have added “speed up and slow down” guy to the list. You come up on a rolling road block guy and try to pass on the left. He then speeds up. You then think that maybe he was just not paying attention so you slow down to get in behind him now that he driving at the correct speed. Instead, he slows down too. Worse yet, he will place himself in your blind spot so you can’t be sure you are past him when you speed up.What I now do is jerk the wheel like I’m about to ram him from the side. Maybe toot the horn while doing it. They stop that nonsense and I can go on my way.

I saw a guy almost fall into the river while using one on a bridge, he had to drop his precious iPhone into the water in order to save himself, true poetic justice.

        Ah, the shorts and vest characters (and I use vest not as perhaps the US does, but much nearer what a basketball player wears) we see in the UK. If I go to the local supermarket, these half-nakeds are there in all weathers, but while it may be “because they are real men*” it is mostly because they have tattoos that have — just HAVE — to be shown off.Imagine getting a tattoo and no one saw it. How terrible that would be! So, to show they have no taste in body art they must wear the least clothing they can, no matter what the weather.So I’d pack them off to the mines for both having ugly tattoos as well as the mental defect that tells them to show them off 24/7.*My definition of a “real man” is those who saunter, with hands thrust deep in pockets, across a busy road within yards of a safe spot or public crossing just to show how tough they are. Pain? Permanent injury? Brain damage? Hey, I’m a real man so they don’t worry me.
