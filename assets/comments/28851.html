        I think that Z Man strawman’s Enoch’s-Johnson’s position a bit when he says they believe that “all of the problems that we have” have a source that we can’t mention.  I guess that both Enoch and Johnson would agree that progressivism is a huge problem that is not entirely emanating from the unspeakable source.  More specifically, I guess that they would agree that some strains of whites have utopian, evangelical and pathologically compassionate tendencies that cause lots of problems for us and that these tendencies are independent of the unmentionable source.From my point of view, we have two interrelated problems, both of which I mentioned above.  As in any case where you have interrelated problems, you have to decide the order in which you are going to work on these problems.For me, the observation that the unspeakable source mostly controls the media and the media mostly controls the beliefs of the white liberals is significant.Merry Christmas everyone!

            I don’t see it as a straw man. In Greg piece, he makes clear that you cannot engage in serious politics without first engaging in the forbidden topic. I have hear Mike say this many times. That is where I get off the bus. I think the crisis lies within European people. There is where the focus must lie.

                I have said here many many times . what the hell is wrong with white people .  look at Iowa for example , little diversity and the people there are more woke on racism that the people in NYC. they can’t hate being white enough .
I can’t claim to much originality there though, the derb was asking that 10 years ago.

        White knighting for the semites will not inoculate our host from being canceled some day.   The take  down of Johnson’s eminently logical discourse on the JQ was particularly bad.  The whole segment was so bad that i tuned out the ukraine segment.   Whats next?  A weekly post on how pervasive anti semitism in America is?  Just be another Instapundit?

        Musk is a rich douchebag, no different than Zuckerberg or Gates.  Apears out of nowhere to become a billionaire.  Yeah, right.  Jews run this freakshow, this corrupt ponzi scheme.  Musk is a sideshow, like Ukraine…look over here while we rob you rape you, inject you and kill your kids.  If you think he defends free speech, say something about  isreal or jews, you’ll have your answer.

        Well, The Z-man is certainly light in his loafers when he dances around the JQ.“Everybody knows about it so why tell people about it?”The answer is as plain as day. Everybody knows about but does not talk about it. Talking is a prerequisite of action.That’s why Ye is being destroyed.  Who knows where his talking might lead?
The Pajeets are muscling in precisely because they act in group solidarity.If Whites start to display the same, we’d beat the interlopers back in two decades.
It’s not brain surgery, Why the pretense?

            I think z, and Jared Taylor’s point, is that the Jews simply do what whites should be advocating for ourselves: always practicing what’s best for them. For centuries, no matter what country they’re in, Jews are always Jews first, and they advocate policies that help themselves and practice in-group preferences. It’s a positive identity. The blacks are trying to do something similar, but the average IQ works too strongly against it working. People like z and Jared Taylor are saying, whites should be focusing on building a positive identity like this, and advocate for our interests, rather than focus on a negative identity of screaming about the Jooos simply doing what we wish to do ourselves.

                    The Greek: “simply doing what we wish to do ourselves”.karl von hungus: “why not do both?”All week, going back to “Custodial Musings” [on December 13th], I’ve been trying to hammer away at the emerging dichotomy of “too many useless people” versus “not enough fake money”.During the quarter century from roughly 1995 to 2020, the shape-shifting oriental middle-men robbed the Federal Reserve of untold trillions of dollars.But now we’ve got a goy at the Fed, and [at least for the time being] the goy has broken the gravy train.No more fake money means stories like the following will soon become commonplace:Goldman Sachs to lay off up to 4,000 peoplehttps://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/4117127/postsThe Crown Jewel of the Diaspora going tits up would have been unthinkable during the Greenspan/Bernanke/Yellen era [which was why Timothy Geithner had to secretly wire a cool billion dollars to the Crown Jewel, in December of 2008, just after the defeat of John McCain, when no one was paying any attention].I’m telling youse guys, Jerome Powell needs to hire some food tasters, plus 25 or 30 ex-USMC ex-Seal ex-Green-Beret Bros to jump in front of the bullets.24×7.None of these shape-shifting entities – Google, Facebook, Blackrock, Goldman – ever earned an honest dollar.All of those business fictions were founded on the premise of infinite fake money flowing forever from the Fed, and when the last of the fake money dries up, they’ll have nothing left to fall back on.PS: Next Prediction… The big new scandal [within the next four weeks or so] will be the discovery of another Fed official going “Lone Wolf Timothy Geithner”, and secretly wiring a large sum of money to one of the shape-shifting entities.Somehow Powell’s name will get bandied about, and then Chuck-E-Cheese Schumer will be handed some ridiculously convoluted argument for his new spiel, the purpose of which will be to have Powell impeached and removed from office [once the majority-Dem Senate is seated].Bank on it.

                The people who largely control the media prohibit positive white identity by relentlessly pathologizing it.  If you want positive white identity then there are a few problems that you must attend to first.

                    Jews control everything, including a Feral Block of Intimidators ready to infiltrate and ruin any group of White men attempting to advocate for their identity or for any cause which might benefit them.
Worse yet: Any group of White male heterosexual males trying to start a ‘club’ or any group of like-minded individuals will be set upon like rats on cheese- by other Whites.
The range is available for your very closely vetted brothers you have known all your life. And be cautious even with them for awhile.

                    There’s nothing prohibiting it. You have to live outside the system and the media and have a positive identity. This is how the Muslims and Amish operate. They don’t pay attention to mainstream media and they don’t send their kids to American public schools. This is why z is always talking about building something outside the system.

                        That’s correct.  I also believe the Amish “burn off” their malcontents through the habit of“Rumspringa”.  Before officially joining the group as a full blown, participating member, their children take a year off and live in the outside world.  Those with a taste for it, stay.  Those who dislike it, return with knowledge and renewed appreciation for their communal lifestyle.
This is juxtaposed to Muslims who use threat of violence to retain membership in the group.  Apostasy being punishable by death.  Not all Muslims, I agree, but some of the more radical from the ME.

            Honest question– how isn’t he? Considering that history is largely written by the Journalists and he had the biggest impact on 2022 history therefore. You can even convince liberals by pointing out that You Know Who Else was also a MOY.
There is of course the obvious problem of all these prizes being reserved de rigueur to a certain Slav this year; but I’d rejoin that Zeylzensskkyy is just too great, just too much of Capt. America, Jesus, &amp; Santa Claus rolled into one, surely it’s insulting to not give him Man of Decade and/or Century.

        This is a great program where a Jewish financier discusses how organized Jewry exerts its influence. It is 2+ hours that is quite a revalation. Everyone needs to ingest and digest this.

        People know our special friends are the most powerful group in America, but the problem is they don’t know why.  Even adjusting for IQ, they are MASSIVELY over-represented in the fields they dominate.  Even the IQ difference is overstated. It’s at best around 105, not 112-115 BS numbers thrown around in the media.They dominate because they view themselves as a group and behave as a group.  You hire one and the next thing you know your company looks like synagogue. They only hire each other and only do business with each other when it is at all possible to do so. They create these groups to attack other people.The case of the ADL’s formation around Leo Frank is instructive here.  He was an evil man who raped and murdered a 13 year old White girl.  From across the country his fellows contributed huge sums of money to get him off. Had a White man done this to a 13yo black girl, other White people would have called for his head.  We have plenty of examples to prove it like the Gary Heidnik case in Philadelphia and this was adults and not even 13 year old children.  There was not a shred of reason to believe Frank dindu nuffin. It was ENTIRELY based on the fact he was a member of their tribe. In their minds, he is important and she is trash.

                Tars Tarkas: “You hire one and the next thing you know your company looks like a synagogue.”According to the Limeys on the other side of the pond, that’s true of the street-sh!tting brahmin, as well; let one brahmin get its toe into the door at your company, and within a year or two, the street-sh!tter’s brothers &amp; sisters &amp; cousins &amp; aunts &amp; uncles will have moved in to replace all the White employees.We’re seeing it around here in the medical skrewls; one street-sh!tter in a subspecialty quickly morphs into ALL street-sh!tters in that subspecialty.Apparently the concept of nepotism is completely unintelligible to the oriental mind.

            Precisely!  This is exactly how they have accomplished their consolidation of power and influence.  However, I disagree with the notion that everyone understands this phenomenon.  The masses, particularly normie Christians, know and understand nothing about how Jews organize and operate as a group.  They look at Jewish success as individual accomplishments and never bother to look any further.  I spent decades being completely puzzled by the existence of anti-Semitism.  After all, why would whites hate other whites who were intelligent and successful?  They even share our “Judeo Christian” morals and values.  This is as far as 95% of whites in the US will go in thinking about the subject.  They know nothing about Kevin McDonald’s writings, the Talmud, Zionism, and Jewish history regarding communism, pogroms, slavery, pornography, and virtually every other form of degeneracy being foisted upon western society.  The message needs to become mainstream and repeated persuasively and relentlessly if whites are ever to mount a defense.

                They don’t know how incredibly disproportionate things are. They generally just think “hey, these slightly different white people do a bit better than us, and happen to be a bit more prominent in certain areas.” That may have even been true in the old America with the old WASP elites.
But if you actually count, the numbers are astounding. Like, every single Joe Biden person is, other than a few useless POC tokens. People either can’t or refuse to see it. A good historical understand of Germany and Russia is also missing among most people.

            Yep, Jews’ success is NOT built on IQ, though they do seem a bit smarter on average, but it’s not much and we have plenty more smart people than they do. From what I’ve seen, Jewish success is built on a couple characteristics in their nature:1. Think and act like a groupNo need to go into this. Everyone knows all about it.2. Near neurotic drive to get ahead/pushinessThis isn’t so much a “hey, they’re hard working,” it’s more a “hey, they’re borderline autistic.” Jews just push things. Sure, there’s a few whites who are like this, but it’s dramatically higher in Jews.But like I said, it’s less about being a hard worker and more about an unhealthy obsession.3. Willingness to go for itJews are willing to risk a lot for the big score. They fail a lot, but sometime they win. And when they do, they take all that money and power and use it boost the Jewish community.Btw, none of this makes Jews evil. It just makes them different. They’re also not some super race that can’t be beat. The Asians beat them by simply not letting them into their societies. It’s one of the reasons China is trying to break away from the American banking strangle-hold. They know who runs it.Also, look at Israel. It’s nothing special.You beat Jews by not dealing with Jews. Hard to imagine now, but if we slowly build our own communities, it can be done. Just don’t forget the lesson.

                Their greatest strength is that they look like us. They can go from “normal white guy” to “tribesman” depending on the situation.They don’t look Chinese and can’t play the “regular Chinese guy” so their schtick doesn’t work on them.Things really change once you can identify them. Eventually you just know, and no longer need to go to the “early life section”. You can tell by how they look, how they talk, their names, their ideas, their morality. Sometimes people are ambiguous too. Almost all the vicious anti-white animus comes from these people. White Libs / Yankees are just fools who go along with it.Their rights were limited for most of European history. They have done well in America with all restrictions lifted and a naive host country with an individualist mindset. They also had a free pass since the end of WW2. I suspect that may be coming to a close.

                    Exactly.I’ve mentioned this many times. American and European Jews, once they went more secular and started to dress and act like the goys, gained a huge advantage.They don’t have that advantage with other races, who either see them as white or Jewish. Trust me, while whites are very naive about Jews, Asians aren’t, neither are Indians.Jews will not be able to do to India or China or Japan or South Korea what they’ve done to the US and Europe, which is why they’re being incredibly stupid ruining the US and Europe. Jews were also incredibly stupid allowing Asians and Indians into the US. Talk about own goal.

                    @B125 –
In a lot of mystery or true crime shows you often see no one ever gets under suspicion until they do another crime that is too similar to something else that was previously thought to be an accident.If they get caught doing a jfk 2.0 or a 9/11 2.0 I’d like to think that normies might be like “holy sh-t what else are they lying about”.

                    The nepotism and tribalism and corruption applies there as well. Their welfare state, corruption and regulatory regime make for a much lower standard of living. Many come here wanting to go back and don’t because they can’t get the same quality of life. Some go back to Israel to give it a go, but there isn’t enough opportunity so they come back here.Of course, if you see the Iron Dome in action, they have built Wakanda for their self defense. They also have a long, long term plan for Israel. They are thinking decades and centuries out. It wouldn’t shock me if commandeering the US nuclear and military power as we crumble and doing the same with Europe once the heritage and indigenous populations have been reduced to just another squabbling minority by mass immigration is on the plan. I have zero proof of this.The video I posted earlier is a must see. You can see how a small but highly organized and dedicated group can commandeer vast amounts of power and funnel billions of even local money to their cause and put a total legal stranglehold on your freedom of speech.I say, thank you for the blueprint. Let’s use it and take this thing back. J. Taylor’s draw a line somewhere and take half is unwise to the point of foolish. Many tribes are salivating over who has that all powerful set of keys/codes. We need to form up and ensure that our guy wins that battle. We need our guys in the military. Putting up with some BS to be on the inside is essential.Whining is for losers. Playing for keeps is for winners.

Have you read Elvis Dunderhoff’s piece on Pup Kink Furry Officers?
https://tinyurl.com/bdeejrk4
We’re gonna need to liquidate about half of the enlisted men and about 90% of the officers in order to have a military we can trust.
How are these Pup Kink s0d0mite s@tanists still breathing O2?
And why didn’t Nelson Rockefeller simply liquidate all of them at Stonewall?

                Ron Unz has done a lot of research on this subject.  For instance regarding admissions to Ivy League schools.   If you take two people with identical academic achievement and experience with no alumni history.  One person is Jewish the other with Christian or no religious preference. The Jewish individual is literally 1000 times more likely to be accepted into the choice school.
Explain that as you will but those are the numbers.  Ron Unz has the articles and research to prove it all.

            (It was also the start of the resurrected Klan, which was actually a loose network of copycats and wannabes.  In this case the small gang called themselves Sons of Mary.  This, before the proto-Hollywood movie (Birth of a Nation) that coalesced into that era’s version of Star Wars Stormtroopers.  Every-body wants to be a Stormtrooper.)And thanks!  Now I can work in a mention:  why tribalism?  Whence its power?  Because Winning is the Only Principle.  Hypocrisy, lying, fabulism, corruption, accusation, doubletalk- water off an commie’s back because winning for one’s tribe Is the only principle.  “Boo, ref, you suck!” This is the narrow moral spectrum Haidt found.Regarding this specific gangster culture: they are mulattoes plus 300 generations.Like their Erectus ancestors, fast-talking hustlers with tribal loyalty is the secret to their fat tail.Comedians, touchy, defensive, certain, emo, haughty, pithy, cynical; the emotional profiles match.Like anyone, the majority are  pretty decent.  Not all ‘Italians’ are Mob, but all Mob are ‘Italian’.As do football players and judges today, they took white mates to advance themselves in a greater white civilization.  Then they learned literacy from us, and were off to the races.  They stole the Book we were writing, and like our science, adapted it to their own advancement.  It is a chronicle of  diversity’s demand for caste war.Summary:  Mulattoes plus 5000 years.  We wrote it, they stole it.Time for us to steal it back- so Merry White Christmas!

                Not all mob are Italians, read up on organized crime in America. There were as many Jews in the mobs as Italians, if not more. The Italian mob became the most notorious while the wasps and Jews fell into the background or became more or less legit. Hollywood, Vegas and even corporate America are in many cases are havens of the old mob.The Pritzger family is a billionaire old money corporate family that less than a century ago was just as mobbed up as the Corleone family. Now they’re totally legit in politics and business. They haven’t changed at all, they’re just hiding it better.

Looks like French intel just tried to pop a Russian diplomat in the Central African Republic:
https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/russian-diplomat-hospitalized-mail-bomb-terror-attack
You have to admire Russia’s patience in not taking the obvious bait.
It also shows how the West fails to understand the Russian mindset because they aren’t reading any of the great Russian literature that provides insight into that people.

        When it comes to Twitter, it seems that Yoel Roth was the de facto CEO of the company, despite having no qualifications besides being a complete degenerate. Another thing that was very interesting is the number of ex-feds on payroll and the close interaction Twitter had with current feds. Indeed it seems like Twitter took all their marching orders from feds and moderated the site in full accordance with their wishes on a daily basis. Twitter seems like less of a company and more of an ongoing CIA psy-op, Operation Mockingbird in full implementation. After all, it never made any money and was considered the most poorly-run tech company, and the change in CEOs (to Agrawal) just led to business as usual.If those days of Twitter as CIA front are indeed over, though, it is a major loss for the GAE. After all, Twitter was remarkably effective for shaping public opinion on all topics relevant to GAE. We saw this to be the case the past six years. It will not be pleased to lose this asset.

        The argument you took fron Mr. Derbyshire that if jews achieved what anti-semites claimed they achieved, then jews deserve to rule is just stupid. The claim y anti-semites is Jewish rule is destroying White people. Derbyshire’s, and by extension your claim, is therefore white people should lie back and accept our destruction. That’s insane, so no thanks. If your argument is that White people are no currently being destroyed, then your views are at odds with reality. I don’t believe you believe that. So now I have no idea what your ideas are for White people to defend themselves, if they cannot at the very least call out the people who are doing the destroying.

            The Derb has a soft spot in his heart for Jews. But I think that he knows that confronting the issue of Jewish power means acknowledging that the entire system needs to be destroyed. And Derb doesn’t want to go there.I also don’t think that Derb writes about whites joining the identity politics game. Same deal. (He also has a Chinese wife and mixed kids so he has some personal issues with identity politics.)Derb strikes me as a guy who knows where all this needs to go, but that destination doesn’t jib with either his own hopes nor with where he’d like it to go for his kids, so he’s decided to leave the issue alone for the most part. But what do I know.I do know that it’s very easy to see when smart guys (Derb, Sailer, etc.) don’t follow their own or nature’s logic. It’s immediately clear that their fudging their writing.

                I read Derb frequently, and I think he bangs the anti-immigration drum pretty hard.  As far as identity politics, if you haven’t read his white version of “the talk”, please do (link below).  It’s a hard dose of race realism that got him kicked off National Review.  The fact he has an interest in other cultures does not necessarily mean he is soft on their negatives.  I haven’t seen his commentary on Jews, so I can’t disagree with your criticism.

                    Derb is a very good writer, perhaps too good for his own good. He dances around the subject of white identity – to some degree, so does Z.Derb very clearly doesn’t want non-white immigration to the West and, particularly, to the US. His view seems to be a sprinkling of the non-whites is fine – say 10% – but more screws things up. He’s right, of course, and that’s how he squares the circle of his personal life with the desire for the US to stay white.So far, so good. But how exactly does the Derb expect whites to rally their back-stabbing politicians, businesses and other ethnic groups who prefer non-white immigration to stop non-whites from invading the West.In essence, the Derb just says that allowing the West to be minority white is a bad thing. Quite true and it gets him in a lot of trouble. However, he never lays out a moral framework for this, much less promoting whites to organize. (Or, at least, I haven’t seen him write about this, though I admit to not reading him much anymore.)He believes that white Western countries should remain majority white, but then doesn’t really say why? The “why” is important.Is it because we’re a people and deserve a homeland? If so, say it. But he doesn’t because that means that whites would head away from the civic nationalism that he loves so much. It would also mean mean whites should think and organize as a people.Instead, again, he dances around why and how whites should stop our demise in the West. Until you can say, “These are my people. Those are not my people. I want this land for my people.” you are nibbling at the edges.As always, never trust someone who can’t answer this simple question: Who are your people?

                    DLS:  Many of us have “an interest in other cultures.”  Many of us have traveled extensively.  But Derb married a Chinese woman – she may be a fine individual, but she is still from a different history and culture and genetic line.  That is far different than a mere ‘interest’ in other peoples and places.Derb primarily reserves his criticism for blacks (like Sailer and the majority of his commentariat)  and skirts around all the other non-White grievance groups.  The only criticism of Chinese I’ve seen in his writing is for the current government and system, not the people and culture.And, like all parents of mixed-race children I’ve read, he insists his children look/present/act White.  If you cannot look at your own mixed-race family with some sort of objectivity, you cannot legitimately address the issue at all.

                The Derb just wanted to keep his job, read his review of Culture of Critique. he tells the reader at the start he will never get the Jew thing, its a very bad idea if you want to continue working in the media.
It wasn’t the Derb who labeled Kmac the Marx of the anti semites, someone else put the title on the review, the editor or sub editor
AFAIK Kmac didn’t like it, but you could take it as a complement IMO

                It’s hard to find people good on the subject of our small hatted friends.  Derb is right about one thing with them….the subject makes people crazy.  We call people like Enoch and Duke antisemites because that is the sole focus they have. Every problem in the world is directly traceable to the magical people responsible for everything.
Then there’s the people on the other end of that spectrum, dindu nuffins and we should be thankful for their presence among us.  Speaking on the subject is good way to be called, at the same time, an antisemite and a philosemite.

            Well, seeing how one notable attempt fared, a note of caution is in order.
Not only the most humane deportation program ever attempted, those guys recovering from Weimar literally built Israel, paying the Havarra emigrants to leave and sent billions in building materials.
That’s gratitude for ya.Some people’s notion of gratitude is light years away from ours, but we are way, way too forgiving.
Now, if we spoke to them in a language they understood, they’d respect us.  But then we’d be Stalin.

        Musk just proves that democracy is B.S. Elites shape the masses to cause the change they want to see, not the other way around. One billionaire with an axe to grind against the tranny cult (which one of his kids got caught up in) has created more change for the “right wing” movement than 40 years of voting for Uniparty-Red.Bezos doesn’t seem to be on board with Biden either, but he is much quieter about it. My general sense is that some percentage of elites, and more so some men of the petit-bourgeoisie and upper middle class, are growing unhappy with clown world, but those in charge of Hollywood, media, and Washington are full steam ahead.What does that mean for us though? It means continuing to create parallel societies and institutions, ready to jump in when the opportunity strikes. It means affecting the “ether”, putting out ideas into the general sphere, hoping some people like Musk pick up on it.

            It’s a war of technocrats who are debating which direction technology will lead us:One side wants to everyone into homogenized sludge with no roots where they can be incessantly tracked by the regime.  They want them doing mainly meaningless, make work jobs before voluntarily being killed in a MAID like program with a low carbon footprint.The other wants humans and machines to merge, enter the stars, and achieve ascension to higher life forms.Frankly, both are radically anti-human and bound for disaster, but the latter gaining ascension at least gives our guys some room to create uncomfortable conversations about genetics and the nature of human organization.

            Spot on.
Everything Musk’s recently forged enemies is ultimately counterproductive to them.
Bezos’ rice bowl has been dinged. It makes him just as dangerous. The “Left,” for want of a better term, lacks impulse control and is reckless. This is the only reason it has not been able to consolidate its grip on all levers of power. Eventually enough elites will have been angered and a check will be put on the Left. All hell will break out then, and we do need to be prepared at the personal level.

        There are few people as loathsome as “journalists” and as deserving of our utter contempt, though celebrities give them a good run for their money. Their self righteousness is just the icing on the cake. If any “journalist” ever gets arrested for blatantly breaking laws, the rest of them cry out in pain and carry on like “our democracy” is at stake. They give themselves awards, which is really funny. Most of them are retarded.  Maybe when the Aztecs vote themselves into power, they will start sacrificing them to the volcano gods.  It’ll be good family fun to watch.

The elites ARE our lions.  Always have been, always will be.  Zman is spot on by saying the millions may provide cover and backbone for an elite, but don’t ever kid yourself that “the millions” could organize a bake sale, much less an effective political platform.

            It is and the constitution and character of that million make all the difference. 200 years ago that million would already be a functional army if they experienced what we are experiencing right now.Today? They are soft flabby effeminate cucked men who have never known a day of hardship in their lives, soyboys, clueless soccer moms, turbo b-tch wahmen, voters, and grillers. And I’m talking about people on the -right- not the left. (Who are far worse) You going to organize that? Think again. It is very obvious these people will be rising up against nothing until it is on the doorstep.There are three things that will motivate normie to true action, this is the blackest pill that I’ve already swallowed:1) No Food2) Power Outage3) Violence outside their window be it through the ferals breaking loose or war.Short of that, you will see no mass movement in your lifetime. Count on it. Covid proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that 9 out of 10 people you encounter are NPCs and sheep. Any manner of indignity can be heaped on them and they will remain docile &amp; compliant.  We have it too good still. Every time someone posts here about ‘any day now’ for the uprising my eyes glaze over and I just tune out completely. It is the equivalent of Jesus coming back to save us all in our hour of need. Not happening…You are responsible for you. Period. Get yours, do what you can to throw wrenches and undermine w/o raising suspicion, get yourself as financially sound and as physically fit as your able. Those are your options in this interregnum we find ourselves in. If enough people are doing this as lone wolves it still has a net effect and it becomes untraceable because there is no ‘group’ to be infiltrated.

                What you say is unquestionably true. However, there is one other scenario that could prove our salvation. Insane Clown World, because of its shrieking irrationality, internal contradictions, and the galloping stupidity of its elites, could weaken and disintegrate of its own accord, which would negate its ability to project power, not only around the world, but even to the periphery of its own domain. And, if central power declines enough, it is certainly possible that like-minded whites will be able to create functionally, and possibly formally, autonomous areas in the hinterlands.Much as the Roman Empire collapsed and localized feudatories sprang up in its place, so too with the GAE and independent racial polities.

                    This, a thousand times.The one constant green shoot is the impulsivity and recklessness of the Left. But/for that aberrant, uncontrollable behavior it would have been game, set, match long ago vs. always bordering on it. What we are seeing with Musk is a very good example. He was the Left’s best ally with deep pockets (filled by the State) but when he deviated one small degree from Regime orthodoxy, he became Public Enemy Number One. He is still the same grifter and lefty but Musk has been forced into opposition with the Regime’s foot soldiers. This will play out with others again and again. As B1 mentioned, the same is playing out with Bezos below the surface because his rice bowl has been slightly dinged; in time he also will be in a struggle with the Left because it cannot control itself.The wildcard in all this, and we don’t dwell on it although we should, is these unhinged and undisciplined types control nuclear stockpiles. Any future opening will be closed if that pops off.I agree with Apex there will be no uprising from below, but once enough Musk types are alienated, and have functional control of the MIC and its thug civilian counterparts, things change (unless they have been vaporized).

        I know “journalists” are dumb, and I know that if they could see the skull-fornicatingly obvious consequences of their actions they wouldn’t be Leftists, but holy tap-dancing Buddha, what an own-goal that ch!ld pr0n stuff is turning out to be.As you’ve written many times, Z Man, the Left only succeeds because they hold the moral high ground. Which to their… credit, I guess, the “right” seems to vaguely grasp. That’s the point of DR3, after all — if “racism” is the worst sin, then pointing out the Dems R the Real Racists should be a winner. But since the Left are utterly shameless it doesn’t matter……but the CP thing is just a bridge too far. I can’t  get too worked up about the Left’s “racism,” because, well… you know. But CP is just disgusting, and these people are truly horrible. Nonetheless they could get away with it, if not for their bizarre insistence on “normalizing” all their perversions. I don’t know what the counter-morality that the Dissident movement must have in order to win will eventually turn out to be, but making “no more grooming!” point #1 is a major step in the right direction, and the Left’s “journalists” are really doing us a solid.

            They’re greasing the skids right now to normalize pedophilia. There’s no sexual depravity that they feel comfortable taking a moral stand against. Bringing kids to drag shows, gay pride parades, and teaching them sex and gender fluidity from elementary school sets up sexualized confused youths, perfect prey. If you were to look into a crystal ball 10 years in the future, would you be shocked to see CNN and the NTY promoting pedophilia as normal, and those opposed to it as bigots and purveyors of misinformation?

                CA Dem Congresswoman Katie Porter aka “Katie Porker” (hugely fat White woman) has already done this. She harangued people for saying the words pedophile and groomer, saying it was objectively anti-gay. Since she’s in a safe Democratic District and has no internal rivals its a safe move for her.
They have no fear, none at all, because a dump of 4:30 AM ballots insures a lifetime of electoral victory. No fear at all.

It’s more than that.  It’s also that the foot soldiers, Antifa and BLM will terrorize people who disagree.  Corporations will fire people and take away their livelihood if they protest this.  While the ballot dumps are a big part, it is not the only thing.

                        Correct. People need to stop thinking solely in terms of politics and government, and instead to begin thinking in terms of a unitary Power Structure comprised of DC, Wall Street, academia, the media and Hollywood. This Power Structure is a seamless whole with an objective that is explicitly anti-white and anti-Western.

                    Porter isn’t in that safe of a seat.  I am sure her district has been fortified, but she won this time 52-48% the vote margin was about 9,100 in her favor.  In California, they don’t rely on middle of the night ballot dumps, they take weeks to tabulate the results so they have plenty of time to bring in the extra votes they need.  But based on how close this is, I don’t doubt a majority of the voters in Porter’s district hate her.

                        I was in Porter’s district, then my area with Trump flags and the Nixon Library was carved away and put in a district where an R won by about 10%.  So that carve out is what put her back in her seat.
Even then Porter just scraped by.  If those “religious Hispanics” that keep pulling the D lever woke up to her rabid wokiism maybe she would lose her seat, but I don’t see that happening.

                    The fact that she A) felt safe doing this and B) hasn’t been forced to resign, shows that the regime feels that it doesn’t even have to police it’s own ranks for this anymore.  That’s the other issue with fortified democracy as they believe they can now get away withanything, which, maybe they’re right, but the downside of being wrong is not really worth the risk methinks.

She can shout that from the rooftops.  All it does is point out that many gays are pedophiles and groomers.

                    Here’s the quote from Porter.
During a Congressional hearing on ‘anti-LGBTQ violence,’ a Democratic Representative parroted the same claim as several LGBTQ activists that the terms ‘groomer’ and ‘pedophile’ are discriminatory against sexual preferences and gender identity.
“You know, this allegation of ‘groomer’ and ‘pedophile,’ it is alleging that a person is criminal somehow and engaged in criminal acts merely because of their gender identity, their sexual orientation, their gender identity,” Porter claimed.

            Anyone who is able to be promoted to high office in the West has some kind of kompromat. TPTB simply won’t let anyone reach those heights without something to keep them in line.
It used to be bad habits, embezzling, affairs, and gay stuff. Now that those three things are normal sauce, so the only thing left was pedophilia. Now they’re going to normalize that?? If so, then what could possibly TPTB have over some power-seeker? Because I can’t think of anything worse.

                Everyone keeps saying it’s a bridge too far to normalize pedophilia.  Is it?  Look at the people taking their kids to drag shows.  It’s all white suburbanites.
The deep rooted problems of our society are not just brought on by a sociopathic, inept ruling class, they are also brought on by the people we are forced to live around and co-exist with.
For me personally, there is no word big enough to describe my disdain for these people.  If I could physically remove them from earth I would do it without hesitation or remorse.

                    This is what I keep thinking every time someone insists that the pedo stuff is the red line.  Once the social pressure to be a goodthinker is applied, your average normie is going to send little Timmy off to the elementary school prom night with Mr. Slippyfist and, on top of it, think themselves good people for so doing.Remember the gay stuff used to be a red line that no one would tolerate.  Before that letting black people sit on our toilet seats was the red line.  Before that letting your daughter show off her ankles in public.  In every case all it took was a little dab of That’s Not Who We Are™ to totally retcon prole morality.

                If CP and all the other forms of degeneracy are fully normalized, then TPTB won’t need to keep anyone in line because everyone will be fully in thrall to their agenda. It will become a society that has fully fallen and has no standards whatsoever. Already we are starting to see this in some places on some policies, for example, the media was crowing about how opposition to abortion hurt Republicans in some places.

                The homosexual risk was passe even by the early 70s. Have you ever read “Banford’s “The Puzzle Palace”? It’s a history of the NSA. If I recall the story correctly, way back when (book is from mid-80s) a few highly cleared employees in NSA were discovered to be of the gay variety. Since they were apparently valuable workers, they were required to disclose their homosexuality to their family, to minimize risk of blackmail.
I do agree that kompromat must exist in various forms. Probably always has to some degree.

            Sadly, it will not be child pornography per se that checks the Left, for want of a better description. But the impulsivity that causes such an abhorrent and repulsive message to be pushed will destroy the Left when the Elite has enough. For example, even though it is ultimately counterproductive, the Left is going after its former ally Musk because he deviated slightly from the Regime orthodoxy. The Left will continue to be reckless and self-destructive until they screw around with one too many Musks. That day is coming.

        It’s been rather heartwarming to learn about the trouble the antifa lunatics are finding themselves in these days. Maybe the hot water they are in will remove some of the foul stench. The mug shots are hilarious as we consider physiognomy.
Have a nice break, Zman. Looking forward to the listening to the song about the boys singing “Galway Bay” and the bells ringing out for Christmas Day.

        Regard West and the Jews, I agree that West looks like a clown. However, I disagree that everyone knows that Jews run things. The vast majority of people I know – good, wholesome upper middle class folks – really don’t know that Jews run things. If you get outside the East Coast that number falls even further.Now, perhaps in DC and NYC, or in certain professions – law, entertainment, high finance – most of the middle management people know about Jewish influence, but outside of those areas and profession, you’re average engineer or accountant or project manager really does have no clue about Jews.Believe me, in the Midwest, they barely know that Jews exist as a group and if they do think about them for more than ten seconds, they think of them as just another white ethnic group, like Italian or Irish or Catholic, and assume that Jews think of themselves as “American” first and Jewish as a very, very distant second, third or not at all.

                Yeah, there’s a fair amount of that as well.
It’s actually stunning that Jews are trying to destroy white America as they’ve never been more accepted or treated better by another group in history. It’s not even close.
You can’t change a people’s nature, I guess.

        We’ve had a Uniparty in the US since at least the Clinton presidency, but the chimera of two party system has persisted nonetheless. That perception will continue to change as vote rigging becomes more apparent, but a large cohort of the electorate will still chase the carrot of voting harder-harder because it’s easy and the alternatives involve real work or effort.The good news is that, as with the Soviet Union, a dysfunctional government will eventually collapse, and it will likely be unexpected and fast. In 1991, the newly designated Russia was descended upon by financial vultures and it produced a decade of misery for the dirt people while a very few oligarchs became billionaires. Imagine how different things might have been if those vultures has been expelled or extirpated upon arrival on the scene.Those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it.

        I dunno, I thought Johnson’s point with his article was that White people should group together and cheer for their own team like the Jews do, but I admit that I may have been reading in to it what I wanted to.As far as election fortifications go, GA,NM, AZ, NV, MI, MN, and PA are all fortified beyond the reach of non-inner party pols.  Even nominally blue states like CO, MA, NY, and IL would probably be at least remotely competitive were it not for The Cheat, but their urban areas have the votes heavily locked down.  That leaves the GOP with a couple unpopulated red states (WY, ID, etc) and states with some security on their voting (I think just OH and FL).  That’s not even enough to make it interesting.  (Well, it *will* be interesting, just not in the way that they’re thinking).

            I think that is the key insight as well. When we lived in a society where people were willing to drop their continental national identity to be American (in the founding sense of the word), that worked. Of course, in the settlement/expansion phase of the nation claiming space and being industrious made that easy. The non-WASP immigrant phase changed that to more job seekers. WWII meant that the European immigrants became American. However, that was already a different culture. It was the middle class borg pursuit.I think that Americanism was shallow. It was rallying around the flag and the military, and huddling around the television for too many people. In any case, I don’t think being anti some group or another as a leading jab is going to do anything.We do need to become a group. That group needs to act as a group but only after we take care of business the way the Jews, Subcontinentals, and East Asians have. We need to form our elite and be better than theirs. Then we look out for our own people in the Clouds and on the Ground.In that sense Johnson is correct. The group strategy will crush the atomized individual strategy. Rather than whining about like POCs and blaming and complaining, let’s buckle up and achieve to our full potential. This time, let’s adopt the in-group preferences and strategies. The egalitarian melting pot is a lie. Let’s stop being the only group that believes it. It will mean getting comfortable with conflict and learning how to engage in it with the intent to win but keep the battles behind the scenes. It is either that, or being scattered to the winds and ground to dust.

        With respect to Friedman-Bank, magic 8 ball says he never gets to testify. God only knows what will spill out of his mouth.
Euthanizing the enemies of the state aren’t a problem anymore, so I would actually be surprised if they didn’t Epsteen him.
Finally, if you want an entertaining instructive laugh, watch Patrick Boyles YouTube video that dropped a day ago regarding SBF.
It’s informative and wryly comical.

            There seemed to be an odd alignment between when he was arrested and when he declared that people were being hard on him because of anti-Semitism.  I think hot on the Kanye mess they didn’t want such a clown sucking out what little air is left in that balloon.
As for his fate, he seems like a bit of a dolt socially, it wouldn’t surprise me if he really doesn’t know anything (and got the job for exactly that reason).

        Speaking of California insanity, Prop 31 was approved this last November by this states voters. The Cali voter, renowned for their grasp of logic and critical thinking, are having some second thoughts on the implications of Prop 31.See, Prop 31 was a complete ban on flavored tobacco, but the devil is in the details. This ban affects non-tobacco products that many use or have used to quit smoking cigarettes or smokeless tobacco. This includes nicotine pouches, lozenges, and other items that contained no tobacco.What will be the result of Prop 31 is that it will lead to more people resuming their smoking habits. Also, menthol flavored cigarettes fall under this ban ostensibly to combat racism against black consumers. Clown World.

            [Here is a post along these lines that appeared on a kindred forum that shall remain nameless. While this post is credited “Anonymous,” it sounds remarkably like something I’d type 😀]Really? So smuggling methols will be a thing. Pardon the obvious pun, but I say Kool, man.On a just slightly sillier note, negotiations are underway to provide $200,000 “reparations” to Melanic Hominid™ State residents who (presumably) are the descendants of slaves and somehow, a State that never hosted slavery somehow owes descendants just because. I see in today’s loony presshttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11544937/Deon-Jenkins-California-senate-candidate-warns-backlash-reparations-debate.htmlthat some local Blacktivist™ there wants to up the ante to $800,000. Why stop there? Anyway, I wish our near-human cousins good luck with this grift. Whether the State Legislature is really nuts enough to pass some form of it, I don’t know, but I surely would not bet against it.For the remaining 49 States that haven’t gone totally into the Twilight [of Civilization] Zone, I offer a humble suggestion: Give an incentive to all Blacks (genuine citizens ideally who can prove slave ancestry) who reside in those States to move to and become permanent residents of CA. Of course details would have to be hammered out, but perhaps something like this: provide assistance in finding housing there and getting on benefits. After proof of being a resident for (say) one year or more and not setting foot where they moved from, each Negro would be awarded $1,000 or its equivalent in menthols, redeemable at the nearest out-of-state cigarette retailer.I salute California’s progressive government for being the vanguard of attempting to right the wrongs the Blacks have suffered, all the fault of Whites of course. I wish them great success in handing out cash to “their” Blacks, and I hope they’d welcome other oppressed Blacks from elsewhere in our still-White-Supremacist nation.

                Imagine a 1980s-style comedy where the protagonist is forced (maybe by threat of prison if he refuses) to run for an office he doesn’t really want. He senses that the only way out is for his controllers to voluntarily change their minds, so he subtly tries to sabotage his campaign at every opportunity. Little does he know that his backers themselves are coerced, and must continue to push him no mater how non-viable he becomes. As the election approaches, the candidate finds he is more popular than even he expected, so he must go to even more and more absurd lengths to sabotage his campaign. Hilarity ensues!

                Yeah, Trump may have “jumped the shark” this time.  He’s looking like a sore loser and huckster rather than a wronged statesmen.  He needs to reinvent himself and fast.  If he has a chance, every word out of his mouth from now on has to be wrt political policy and action in his second term—specifics, not bluster.

                Wild Geese:  It’s not only the sheer grift and blatant money grubbing that struck me, although that was distasteful enough (immediately after Trump put on an estimated $1.5 million wedding for Tiffany and her Lebanese, and while Javanka strolls from holiday to holiday while waiting to move into a custom-built Florida bunker mansion).  What’s most telling, to me, was the imagery of Trump as handsome, vital, muscled-up super hero.  He really seems to like that image of himself, even if it was created by autistes or as sarcasm.  This epitomizes believing his own propaganda, being high on his own supply – whatever the trite expression of your choice.  Knowing he has a massive ego is one thing.  This is beyond parody.

        Calling journalists “clerics” is spot on. That’s exactly how they view themselves. Most don’t make much money, but it does gives them immense power and they feel as though it’s their calling – which, of course, makes them incredibly dangerous.However, the DC/NYC reporters are a different breed. They still don’t earn much money outside of the very top ones, but they do okay and are usually married to someone who does make money. They also view themselves as the priestly class but also a full-blown member of the upper managerial class.Basically, most reporters are like the local priests (local power but not very disconnected from the real power) whereas the NY Times/WSJ/WaPo/Network reporters are the bishops and archbishops. Most grew up on the East Coast or LA/San Fran and went to big name colleges. They’ve been a part of the upper managerial class from birth. It’s their home and they will defend it.It’s why all these branches of the upper managerial class work so well together. They all come from the same places, went to the same schools, live in a few cities/neighborhoods and have the same culture/worldview.The journalists roles is exactly the role of clergy. They control the information to the peasants and to tell the peasants what’s moral and not. “Israelis bombing and killing Palestinians is good,” while “Russians defending Russians living in Ukraine is bad.”But there’s a big exception. The current clergy is far more reliant on the current rulers for their power than the medieval clerics. Sure, the church relied on the king for power and influence, but even without the king, they still were the word of God. No one today considers modern journalists to have some special ability to channel God or whatever higher power. Their power and influence is solely reliant on our rulers, so they will do whatever they can to protect those rulers.

            The basic problem—in addition to your sage description—is that journalism has lost its direction and fundamental, traditional foundation.  All that has been taught in schools of journalism for at least 2-3 generations is “advocacy journalism”.  No longer is the traditional foundation/core the basics of who, what, why, when, where, how.  It’s now “the end justifies the means”.  Your job as “journalist” is to lead the (benighted) mob on the path of righteousness.Journalists therefore are in thrall to the political winds of the day and become simply propaganda arms of the political party in ascendancy.  Because, the traditional basics of journalism require logical thought and hard work, we see a degeneration of the quality of journalists graduated.  It’s always easier to make it up a you go—especially when you are not subject to criticism as your associates control the sphere of influence (MSM).Goebbels would be proud.

                Advocacy journalism is in part a response to the change in people who went into journalism.Before the 1970s, journalism was considered a blue-collar job for the most part and most reporters hadn’t been to college. That started to change in the 1970s and by the 1990s, every new reporters had been to college.As college grads, they didn’t want to just report the facts. They wanted to influence society and felt that they deserved such power because they were smart college grads, especially if they went to a top college like most people working at the NYT or WaPo did.

                    Pretty similar to my experience with any number of college bound folk who want to land “government positions” when they graduate.  I’ve listened to more than one insipid story of how they have planned their educational goals I order to land assistantships to political office holders and judicial officials.  Makes me ill to think of these little devils obtaining power through such means, rather than dint of excellence in any productive endeavor.  But I guess I’m a product of a dying age.

                Goebbels obviously read “Propaganda”, written by a jewish nephew of Sigmund Freud. But all the techniques were spelled out long ago; Machiavelli prescribed them for Princes, they are referenced in the protocols as well. It is most disturbing to still see ‘red-pilled’ conservatives turn to the same tropes the jews have foisted upon the Western world- “no one ever could possibly be as evil as those nazis who put us in a work camp”. It is to laugh about the grifters like elie weasel who faked a tattoo for the holy victim status. or cry, maybe.

            Not really.  The primaries are for show as well.  The Dem candidate (here at least) is almost always selected prior to the primary.  Indeed, most Dem primaries had only a single candidate.  I suppose in some places you might find a Dem primary with a “Green” candidate or some other nobody, but a real decision between two alternative Dem’s?

            Barrons is now running a hit piece claiming Tesla investors want to replace Musk as CEO.
I’m not sure that would be a bad thing because Musk is so central to Tesla the way Jobs was to Apple and Bezos was at Amazon.
Putting some Cook or Jassy style clod in at Tesla would certainly tamp down the EV buzz.

                It really is extremely amusing to see the propaganda-reader class turn on Musk and Tesla overnight. One day they were shilling and cheerleading for Saint Elon, and now he is unfit to lead, and Twitter could be better run by (insert some eyeball story telling pump-and-dump SV grifter).Think of how many people who literally adore Musk who are also die-in-the-wool lefties/Democrats whose hero is doing an about face and in turn the propaganda-reader-class is doing an about face on him. It also shows them what we know, which is that the “financial news”, is just another arm of the same machine.The modern propaganda machine is so all pervasive that even if you do not watch/follow it it still finds you. In this case I don’t mind it finding me, because its nice to see the steam coming out of the engine and hear some gears grinding and the crankshaft wincing.There is other good news in terms of extra-regime organization. Matt Peterson of American Mind and their New Founding organization just took the first veil off of a new anonymous LinkedIn-like talent/entrepreneur matching service. It will match people who want out of Woke Corp and who want to compete with it. It is now learning to walk.I had some conversations with some people the other day about this sort of thing on some posts here. Have a look at New Founding, (I can’t remember who it was). It doesn’t have a way to flag your woke-opportunist managers or colleagues as bad guys, but you should be able to find some tenaciously competitive entrepreneurs and team mates and hopefully kiss the anti-white animosity at your workplace goodbye. Like any network, the more high skill talent that shows up, the more successful it will be. It may be worth putting up an anon profile just to help the network grow. We have a very deep vested interest in this. The more of us who can be cancel proof, the more we can come forward and encourage more and more people that it is okay to notice and to take our side.Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas everyone! Have a wonderful time with your friends and family. May your New Year be filled with opportunity, good company, and an abundance of blessings of good character, good health and opportunity. See you all next year!

        The way I see all this is this.Flies everywhere land on shit. Lay eggs in shit. Fly away. No sooner does your dog squat and take a shit, that flies arrive to ‘do their thing.’I don’t have to get down on all fours, for a close up look. Yes, if the flies enter my abode, they deserve a fate that means wriggling their last on a strip of fly paper. Swat! Or some spray – if you have some old Raid stock around, better as the new, environmentally friendly version seems to do everything but kill.Extrapolate the above to Tweeters, social media whores, and you get the drift. My approach is to promptly pick up and bury dog shit in an outdoor night soil hole that then gets composted down the road. And even then flies still arrive in seconds, some may even ride the shit into the terra firma, dying to cling to the shit.If you like the sight of flies, and smell of shit, Twitter is for you. Enjoy.
