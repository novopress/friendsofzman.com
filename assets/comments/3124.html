        The bullying tactics of the “Rainbow Party” are also what led the American Psychiatric Association into changing the classification of homosexuality from that of a mental disorder in the first place.

        Not so long ago I went to a ‘pro-feminist’ wedding (hetero couple but who thought the wife should come before the husband) and bizarrely — though perhaps not given the couple’s friend-base in the capital where they lived — they placed a rainbow flag prominently at the entrance to the post-wedding festivities.I have no idea why this couple would think promoting gays are good for them, and even less idea why they think everyone attending the celebrations would think the gay lifestyle is cool.I admit the few I have known have tended to be nasty to their own kind (the words drama queens fits the bill) though I equally know straight women who love them, though I suspect it is because a female can have a ‘good time’ without being approached in any sexual way. Perhaps they find it refreshing to talk about perfumes and drapes with a near-man. Who knows?But the greatest mystery of the gay crowd is their apparent love of muslims. There are gay men who march with their islamist ‘brothers’, waving flags for freedom and the imposition of sharia law while carefully ignoring the fact that homosexuals are routinely executed in places the islamists love. When islam is more entrenched in the west, those freedom-demanding gays may find that flying the rainbow flag leads to certain difficulties.

        I met many gays in NYC, all powerful and influential, most had wife and childrens and knew how to manipulate Conservative and Liberal issues for the Good of their Tribe.
