        Let’s assume evolution is true. ID arguments then offer the opportunity for trial and error to confirm evolution and flesh out the remaining areas of our understanding of it, which would be less likely to happen as quickly and completely, if the ID arguments were not there to push the process along.Now, let’s assume evolution is false. ID offers an alternative view from which to study and evaluate. ID may be wrong, too, but it offers a rich opportunity to perhaps find out what is really going on.Or…evolution is the best and most complete and empirical explanation we have to date, but there are enough unanswered questions and unexplainable elements to keep us searching for clues. I think I buy the third possibility, frankly.The problem all around is everyone is saying “I have the answer” instead of “what are the questions”. Work without bias on the questions and the answers should reveal themselves…eventually.

        I believe Haldane was right, as right as we are going to get. The universe is not only stranger than we imagine, it is stranger than we can imagine. That ironically makes one a believer.

Where do these secular believers in an intelligent Designer congregate? I’ve never seen one in the wild. I guess the 99.99% who came to it through religion must be making all the rest look bad.

            Yeah, it has been my experience that the ID’ers are neo-Christians, the types to go to “non-denominational churches.” But, maybe Jews and Arabs have a lot of ID’er and I have just missed it. I tend to doubt that non-believers would go for ID.

        The trouble is science does not work like religion…Science is the process of trial and error, with error leading to new discoveries.
Heh, you have been paying attention to climate science right?  I’m not about to defend ID or creationists, but simply shouting ‘Science!’ is no vaccine against magical thinking.

No doubt. I’ve argued since the start that Climate Change is closer to witchcraft than chemistry, on the empiricism scale. The only thing that lack is animal sacrifice.

        hmmm although the ID movement does have Christians , it’s mostly secular. Some ID people are proposing alternatives to evolution as well as pointing out evolution’s possible confusions. Some ID folk are  obstinate but others are open to the possibility of being wrong. Besides the science, maybe Derb likes evolution maybe because he sees himself and others like him as the most evolved alpha smart humanoids.
