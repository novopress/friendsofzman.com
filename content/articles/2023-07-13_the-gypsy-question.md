If you go to certain parts of Europe, one of the things you will
experience is this class of people who sort of exist and sort of not
exist. They exist, as in they are part of non-contextual reality, but
everyone tries to ignore them. You notice them when their children beg
for money or try to sell you some useless trinkets. This is often just a
way to distract you while they steal your wallet. These are, of course,
Gypsies or what the cultural enforcers call the Roma people.

Gypsies are not everywhere. In Paris it feels like they are everywhere
if you hang around the tourist areas. In Copenhagen there are no
Gypsies, at least not in the main areas like you see in tourist traps.
They exist in Denmark. Official statistics say there are about 5,000
Gypsies in the country, but the nature of Danish society makes the
pick-pocket lifestyle impossible for them. Instead, they find other ways
to sustain themselves that do not involve street crime.

In other parts of Europe, they will be in what amounts to Gypsy ghettos.
This is most common in the old communist bloc. Ghettoization of
minorities has been the habit in that part of the world for a long time.
With lots of different people thrown together in artificially
constructed kingdoms, the best solution to social conflict was peaceful
separation, so minority troublesome populations ended up in ghettos.
This persists today for universally despised populations like Gypsies.

That is one of the first puzzles about the Gypsies. Throughout Europe
they are hated, and they have always been hated. Even the efforts to
embrace the new American religion regarding diversity and inclusion has
not extended to the Gypsies. No amount of hectoring can overcome
centuries of hatred. That raises an obvious question as to why these
people continue to exist as a population. Why have they not disappeared
through assimilation and self-deportation?

This becomes even more of a puzzle when you see that the locals have not
just treated these people as pariahs. Some people have probably heard
about the organized murder of Jews in the Second World War, but the
murder of the Gypsy population dwarfs the other persecutions. Half of
the Gypsy population was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_Holocaust" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">killed</a> in the war, mostly because it was an
opportunity to kill them. The locals just took advantage of the
opportunity to rid themselves of these people.

Logic says that if you are at risk of death living where you live, then
you would be smart to find a new place to live. American suburbs exist
because of this logic. Fearing black crime, white people moved from
cities into the surrounding suburbs. The Jewish population in American
swelled a century ago because Jews were under constant threat in the
Russian empire. The great wave of Jewish immigrants at the end of the
19th century was mostl from the fringes of Tsarist Russia.

Despite facing “you’re not welcome” signs all over Europe, the Gypsy
population remains a fixture. It says something about a people that they
want to be somewhere that they are not wanted and will never be
accepted. It could simply be that alienation reinforces their culture.
They hang together because it is impossible for their members to
assimilate into greater society. This results in their culture having a
hostile and parasitic relationship with the host population.

This process operates for other subgroups. The Travelers in the
English-speaking world are a lot like the Gypsies. They are
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep42187" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">not</a> Gypsies. They are Irish, Scots, and English that
probably came into existence in the 17th century. The people we are now
supposed to call the Roma are an Indo-Aryan ethnic group that migrated
out of the Indian subcontinent around 1000 AD. Despite having no
biological, linguistic, or cultural connection to Gypsies, Travelers are
remarkably similar.

The theory is that Travelers became landless people who learned to
survive travelling around doing labor and stealing. That last part is
what made them social pariahs and isolated them from the rest of
society. Most likely, those who could integrate back into society and
wanted to do it, were boiled off. The result was a selection process in
favor of people with a strong desire for the lifestyle and the ability
to serve the people inside their clans, resulting in an increase in
Traveler-ness.

This turns up in genetic studies. Closed populations will tend to have
specific genetic issues due to the founding population having those
traits and the consequences of marriage only within the group. The Amish
are another good example. What this means is that once a group is cut
off from the main group, a process develops that reinforces this
separation both culturally and biologically. In the case of the Gypsies,
who they are depends in part on being despised by the host population.

Interestingly, Gypsies appear to be quite dull. Intelligence studies put
their average IQ in the mid-70’s, which is what you see with Somalis.
This may explain why they are most common in the duller parts of Europe,
like the Balkans. A population of parasitic simpletons is not going to
do well amongst the high-IQ Swedes, but they can survive among the
atomized and tribal population in the Balkans. Even so, it is surprising
that they have survived at all given their limitations.

As a comparison, Irish Travelers check in at around eighty-seven
compared to the average for the Irish population of ninety-two. This
makes sense. Their origin story suggests they were the losers in an
economic game of musical chairs. Rather than end up in ghettos and
trailer parks, which did not exist, they ended up as itinerant workers
and thieves. In the modern age they are known for living in caravan
parks, which are a rough equivalent to the American mobile home park.

The persistence of Gypsies raises another question. The open society
that is being forced upon the West requires assimilation. It is assumed
that minority populations wish to assimilate but are prevented from
doing so because of whiteness. The Gypsies and the Travelers are two
good examples of minority populations that refuse to assimilate because
they know they would cease to exist if they did assimilate. The open
society people have the same Gypsy problem as the fascists.

Of course, the question at the root of it all is what does the majority
do about a minority population that cannot and will not fit into
society? This is a problem that has vexed political philosophy since
John Stuart Mill. You can force them to comply, but this comes at a
cost, and it creates new problems like social unrest. You can remove
them, but as we see with Gypsies, they just keep coming back. Even the
mass murder of Gypsies in the last century did not remove them from
Europe.

The irony is that the solution the world has arrived upon for dealing
with this problem is the one which caused the problem in the first
place. The isolation of unassimilable and incompatible people is what
you see everywhere, not just with Gypsies. The “solution” to the Gypsy
problem is to try to keep them bottled up on the fringes of society,
which ensures that there will also be a steady supply of Gypsies. The
solution to the problem makes sure the problem is never solved.
