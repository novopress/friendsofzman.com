In a previous post on the economics profession, I singled out the
profession’s weird belief that public policy is about efficiency. <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Posts like this one</a> are a
good example of the weird myopia. How is it possible that fully formed
adults cannot know efficiency and efficacy are of no concern to the
welfare state?

If anyone really gave a damn about helping the poor, they would stop
welfare altogether. You would think people in a racket allegedly
designed to study markets would know you get more of what you subsidize.
Paying people to be in the underclass means you get a steady supply of
people in the underclass.

Welfare is, in part, about buying grace. The over-class loves these
cost-free (relative to them) ways to help the poor. Guys like John
Forbes Kerry and Joe Biden don’t give real money to charity. Instead,
they give other people’s money to these programs. The added bonus is
they get to go around the country bragging about how good they are to
poor people, despite the fact they are trying to create more of them.

Even better, their kids get to work in non-profits, funded by
government, that allegedly help the poor. That way when they take over
for dad in the political rackets, they too can brag about being generous
with your money. The politicians in a democracy is like a fireman who
runs around setting fires he can heroically battle. They create the
conditions for an under-class, then claim to helping the under-class.

Another aspect of welfare is aimed at the middle-class. It is riot
insurance. Let the Koreans open their cash businesses in the ghetto. Let
the cops figure out how to keep the ghetto savages penned up. That’s
where welfare comes in. Give them cash to buy a forty ounce, some weed
and some bling. Let ’em sell drugs and shoot one another. If that’s what
it take to keep them on the reservation, so be it.

The middle-class looks at welfare as a cheap way to deal with the
ghetto. Instead of doing the hard work of enforcing social policy that
rewards the fit and punishes the maladapted, they happily pay higher
taxes to maintain urban reservations. They move to exurbs without public
transport in order to avoid the problem. Welfare is not about helping
the poor. It is about political piety and reality avoidance.
