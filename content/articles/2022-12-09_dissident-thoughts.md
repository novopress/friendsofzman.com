Years ago I did a show on what it means to be on the dissident right,
but it was long enough ago to revisit the topic. Back when I did the
show, hardly anyone used the term so it was a different conversation
than today, when lots of people use it. In fact, far too many people
recklessly throw around the label. Just because you got booted from your
Facebook group for using the N-word does not make you a dissident.

What you see is lots of people who used to claim the label alt-right
having stopped using that now discredited term and picking up this new
label. Their opinions have not changed and their understanding has not
changed. They just needed a new label so they scanned around and found
one that had not be ruined yet. In many cases, these people have no
coherent politics at all, just grievances.

Labels are important, especially in politics. The words in the label
bring meaning and connotation, but the label should have its own
definition. The white nationalists are not simply people who are white
and patriotic. Hitler was white and a nationalist, but no educated
person would call Hitler a white nationalist. The label white
nationalist has meaning that transcends the words in the label.

Therein lies the danger with labels. The white nationalists have allowed
the bad guys to define the label they use. It was not all their fault,
as the bad guys control the organs of cultural production, so they were
able to define the label. That said, the many wackos who have been
allowed to use the label white nationalist have made it easy for the bad
guys to anathematize the term by soaking it with their vitriol.

That is why it is important to control your language. This was one of
the many errors made by the alt-right. They never bothered to provide a
clear definition of what they meant by an alternative right. This
allowed every weirdo and goofball looking for a home to lay claim to the
label. If they had put some effort into defining their labels and
controlling who used it, they would have avoided the weirdo problem.

That is the gist of the show this week. What it means to be a dissident
in this time and place, as well as what it means to be dissident right.
I have also sprinkled in some of the things I talked about at AmRen, so
the people who were there will recognize some of the things at the end.
This is a topic that could probably be made into some useful posts down
the road.
