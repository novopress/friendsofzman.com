Summer is here in Lagos. We went from cold mornings and moderate
afternoons a week ago to cool mornings and hot afternoons. Next week is
the unofficial start of summer in the U.S. and the start of high killing
season here in Lagos. There be lots of pent up homiciding, so we are
expecting a banner year. In preparation I am taking next week off from
the show and the Sunday show. Next week is one of the slowest traffic
weeks for the site, so it is a good time for a break.

This week I wanted to clear out the mailbag, but I have been noticing a
trend in the e-mail the last six weeks or so. That is people asking me
about topics that I have not discussed anywhere. I have not done
anything on the Israeli attack on Gaza or the Arizona audit, for
example. Since many of these topics will never warrant a post or a
segment in the show, it seemed like a good time to address them this
week. I am killing two birds with one show, so to speak.

Getting back to the coming of summer, it is looking like an interesting
culture war here in Lagos over the dropping of the masks. Last week, the
Tubby Tyrant in charge of this dump dropped the mask edict. In theory,
you are no longer required to wear a mask when going into stores or
offices. We never wore masks at the office, but if you wanted to go in a
store, you had to wear one. “Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely
exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive.”

So far, no stores have dropped their mask mandate. In fact, the
Covidians seem to be doubling up on their mask discipline. I saw a
normal in the Wawa without a mask and a helpful Covidian tapped him on
the shoulder to remind him it is store policy to wear a mask inside the
store. She was just another customer. I was hoping he would reply with a
right cross, as that is probably the only way these people learn, but he
just ignored her and went about his business. She probably reported him.

I have had some fun with the Covidians I know by saying that mask
wearing goes against the science. You can see that it really cuts deep.
They have spent the last year telling us the CDC is the Oracle of
Delphi. Now their most trusted oracle has turned on them and they have
no way to handle it. That will not stop the lunacy. Instead of stars on
their bellies, the Covidians will have masks on their faces. This could
become a permanent feature of our society going forward.

It is not the worst thing. For a while now it has become clear that
normals cannot live with the crazies much longer. Maybe their decision
to mask up forever will lead to a natural self-segregation of the two
species. The crazies will slowly stop dealing with normals and normals
will be able to easily spot a crazy from a distance. A slow segregation
of the two groups will emerge. it is wishful thinking, I know, but
summer is upon us and it is the time to think positive thoughts.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
