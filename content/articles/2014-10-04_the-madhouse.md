*It had been a relatively quiet policy debate until the full-page ad
appeared in the local newspaper. “A male wants to shower beside your
14-year-old daughter,” it said. “Are you OK with that?”*

*The ad, placed by a socially conservative group in Minnesota, was meant
to snap attention to a proposal to allow transgender students to play on
teams based on their preferred gender rather than the sex assigned to
them at birth.*

*It appears to have worked. More than 100 community members flooded a
meeting this week near Minneapolis, and thousands more sent e-mails. In
response, the quasi-public body governing high school sports in
Minnesota decided to delay a vote on a new policy covering sports
participation by transgender students. Members of the board of directors
said they needed more time to study the issue.*

*The policy, which they now plan to vote on in December, was an attempt
to grapple with a question that has bedeviled many states: How do you
deal with the growing number of children identifying as transgender who
want to participate in the highly gender-specific worlds of high school
sports and extracurricular activities?*

When the Left stopped using the word sex to mean male and female and
started using the word “gender”, you know we were headed for trouble.
Back then, the madness was about denying the obvious differences between
boys and girls. Hilariously, they claimed that sex was a social
construct, not a biological one. In order to mask the madness, they
changed the language. If you let the lunatics control the language,
everyone eventually sounds like a lunatic.

The fact that “growing number of children identifying as transgender”
does not set off any alarm bells speaks volumes. Science tells us that
human beings evolved very slowly over thousands of generations of trial
and error. It does not happen overnight. Therefore, “new” traits and new
“trends” are never new. Either we just discovered a way to notice or we
are kidding ourselves, pretending the old is new. In the case of
children suffering from the mental disease of “transgenerism” the latter
is the most likely answer. Turning a mental disorder into a fad is
almost as crazy as thinking you are the off-spring of a

Those crazy people I references at the start have been handed control of
society. Now it is the sane who are tormented, wondering if they are the
ones losing their minds because they don’t think reality is infinity
negotiable. If you don’t want a homosexual taking your son into the
woods, you’re a child abusing nut. If you think your daughter should not
be forced to shower with the boys, you”re a sexist. If you punch a woman
in the face, you’re a misogynistic monster, but if you come to that
woman’s aid, you’re also a misogynistic monster.

In the madhouse of modern America, this makes sense, What’s wrong with
you?
