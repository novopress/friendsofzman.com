This week’s show is a continuation of last week’s show. The point of the
effort is to describe the various aspects of the ruling regime. We don’t
have a good name for this form of rule and one reason for it is it just
sort of happened. Unlike various forms of socialism, there is no one guy
at the center of it. It is the combination of historical and economic
events over the last two centuries. The great contribution of Karl Marx
was having a last name that made for a pithy label.

In last week’s show, I thought the segment on managerialism was the
best, but it is also the most studied aspect of the system. We have 80
years of writing on the growth of the administrative state. This week I
think the two segments that are most important are Custodialism and
Quadripartism. This growing sense by our rulers that they need to take
care of us is rising from and encouraging this blending together of the
power centers of the American empire.

There is a feudal aspect to this arrangement. People think of feudalism
as knights saving damsels in distress. That makes for good story
telling, but it was really a fully integrated social control system. The
reciprocal relationships between the warrior elites evolved into a set
of customs governing all of society. The duties and responsibilities the
warrior elite had with one another became a model for society. The life
of every person was defined by his duties and responsibilities.

Something similar is happening with the power centers of the empire.
They are working out the rules with which they regulate behavior towards
one another. At the same time, they are working out rules to govern
those within their domain. Instead of a code of chivalry it is terms of
service. Like life in feudal Europe, people are either compliant or
non-compliant. The compliant get the privileges and protection of the
system while the non-compliant are fair game.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
