I’m not sure if I’m an outlier on this, but I have lost all patience
with the news to the point where I don’t even scan the news sites. For
dissidents, current events is always a spectator sport, so I usually
don’t get too worked up about this stuff, but lately my tolerance has
dropped to zero. I hit the Post of Times and my first thought is, “who
are they trying to kid with this stuff?” It’s like they are not even
trying. Maybe it is just me, but I’ve dropped out of the new watching
for the time being.

As a result, this week’s show is mostly news free. I have a list of
these sorts of shows I want to do as time and inclination permits. They
take a little longer to prepare, so I have to plan ahead, but I think
they make for a nice break from the normal routine. This is not a
history podcast or a deep dive analysis type of show, but doing a little
bit of that stuff from time to time is a nice corrective to the insanity
of the age. A little diversity is a good thing and nothing says
dissident politics like the love of diversity!

I think the parallels between our age and the events leading up to the
Great War are quite remarkable, so it is a favorite topic. History does
not necessarily repeat itself, but it is good to remember that there is
nothing new under the sun. The things we see from our ruling class, for
example, are not new. In fact, they should be predictable. Understanding
how a panicked ruling elite responded to the Red Scare a century ago
will help us understand how they are going to respond to the White
Scare.

In the course of doing the show, I kept thinking that a show on
anarchism one day may be a fun thing to do. It is, by far, the weirdest
of the radical political movements to arise from the prior age. My hunch
is it is one of those movement where the adherent fell in love with it
at first exposure. The more you study it, the crazier it seems, so to be
a dedicated anarchist means not thinking about it too much. Instead, you
just focus on expressing yourself through violence and mayhem.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
