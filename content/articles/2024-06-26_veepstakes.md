**Note:** I am doing a Q&A type of show this week, so if you have any
small topics of interest, pass them along in the comments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Between now and the start of Donald Trump’s debate with the CNN hosts on
Thursday night we will learn the name of his running mate. Trump said
that his pick will be at the debate, so it has been assumed that person
will be revealed at that point, but Trump is being cagey about it. He
has invited various people to stand around the backstage area during the
debate, so maybe the suspense will continue. There is no audience for
this debate, as Joe Biden is now easily startled by loud noises.

It used to be that the running mate selection was one of the first big
tests of a party’s candidate because it spoke to the strength of the
candidate. In 1976 Jimmy Carter picked Walter Mondale to balance the
ticket geographically and to assure Washington insiders that he would
not cause any trouble. Reagan did a similar thing in 1980 when he picked
former CIA head George Bush. In both cases, the running mate pick
suggested the candidate had enough insider support.

For establishment candidates, the running mate was about geographic
balance or shoring up a party constituency. In 1988 George Bush had all
the Washington support he needed, but the party base found him to be a
bit weird so he went with Dan Quayle from Indiana on the theory he would
win over heartland voters. In 2004 John Kerry picked John Edwards to add
geographic balance and add some personality to a ticket featuring a man
who appeared to be made of wood.

The running mate pick has lost its luster of late. No one remembers who
Hillary picked for her running mate. He may be dead now for all anyone
remembers. Trump picked Mike Pence, mostly because Pence is so boring.
He was not expected to add anything to the ticket but serve as Trump’s
emissary to the uniparty. George Bush II picked Dick Cheney because the
people who picked George Bush II told him to pick Dick Cheney so he
could run things from inside the administration.

The funny thing about the running mate job is it has always been the
death sentence for a political career. Vice Presidents rarely go on to
win the top job. Fifteen vice presidents went on to become president,
but eight of those got the job when the president died or was
assassinated. Only four of those won an election in their own right. It
is one of the other rarities of the 2020 election. Not only did a man
with dementia become the most popular man in the country, but he was
also a former VP.

This may be about to change with Trump. Since he is limited to one term,
his running mate will be viewed as the guy who inherits the MAGA
movement and gets the Trump endorsement for running in 2028. We are
about to have a great die off in both parties, so it will be a scramble
over the next decade among the toadies and flunkies to see who gets to
pretend to be in charge of things. Being a second or third banana is
going to become a coveted position.

You can see this with Biden. His people picked a cackling simpleton as
his running mate because it was seen as life insurance. Installing a
moron like Harris as president is too much even for the psychopaths
running Washington, so picking her as the VP meant no one was going to
put a pillow over Biden’s face. That was a fine plan for the Biden
family, but now the party is stuck with a guy who soils himself in
public while staring blindly out into space during public events.

This is what will make Trump’s pick interesting. Has he managed to learn
anything about his moment in the timeline? If he picks another stooge or
someone dictated by the party, then it is another reminder that Trump is
not a historical figure as in a man who is shaping history, but rather
he is a feckless ignoramus who just happened to be swept up by the tides
of history. If he picks someone expected to continue the fight, then
maybe Trump has learned something.

Ten years of Trump says the way to bet is that he picks the worst
possible option as his running mate, which would be someone like Glenn
Youngkin. He is a less masculine version of Liz Cheney. He has
Washington support, is loved by the neocons, and has deep ties to the
economic elites. If Trump picks him, it means the regime has decided to
let him win and then wear his administration as a skin suit. In effect,
the populist rebellion will have officially died.

Of course, the main problem for Trump picking an heir is that his MAGA
movement has zero institutional support. It is why every candidate in
the primary was a zombie from the plant where they produce Republican
politicians. The only guy who sounded like Trump was Vivek Ramaswamy and
he was probably faking it. Then you have the fact that you cannot let
South Asians anywhere near power in a white country. Just look at what
is happening in Canada and Britain.

In this regard, Trump’s final big decision as a player on the political
stage reflects the reality of the system. It is beyond reform, so that
means there is no solution through the normal functioning of the system.
You cannot vote your way out of the problems of democracy because the
point of democracy is to prevent it. “Our democracy’ is a rigged game in
which the house must always win. In the end, that will be the lesson of
Trump and the populist rebellion that produced him.
