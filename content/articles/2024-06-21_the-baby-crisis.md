After putting the show together I thought about many things I could have
included but either forgot or did not think about until I got into the
topic. The demographic collapse we are seeing in the West gets some
attention, but no where near enough given the enormous consequences that
lie ahead. No civilization that we know of has gone down the path on
which the West has embarked.

A subject that gets even less attention is the fact that fertility rates
are dropping all over the world, not just in the West. Mark Steyn wrote
a book about this years ago, but conservatives are too dull to think
about such things. David Goldman also wrote about this around the same
time, but he too was ignored. There is a great deal of leaving alone
going on with regards to collapsing fertility rates.

If you are a conspiracy buff, you could add in the Covid panic and how
the virus was deliberately created and maybe accidentally on purpose
released into the world by the sorts of people who cheer demographic
collapse. You will note how the origin story of the Covid virus is also
getting a good leaving alone. A cynic might think that maybe there is a
link between collapsing fertility and engineered superbugs.

Based on what we know, it seems unlikely that the people running the
world are trying to snuff out humanity, but the point of mentioning it
is that there are a lot of angles to the global fertility crisis. The
fact that the great and the good are putting so much effort into making
sure no one thinks about it is a story in itself. There is a reason they
do not want the masses thinking about this topic.
