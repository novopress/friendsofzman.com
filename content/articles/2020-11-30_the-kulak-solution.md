------------------------------------------------------------------------

One consequence of the Trump victory in 2016 was that many people were
reassured that reform was still possible. Trump was an imperfect vessel
for a reform movement, but he was just the guy to shake things up. He
would be both a warning to the establishment and a catalyst for reform.
The last four years proved that to be a false dawn, but people had hope
for the 2020 election. The rigged election has probably put that idea to
bed for most white people.

The question now is where do we go from here? If the Republican Party is
a waste of energy and the Democrats are now the anti-white party,
conventional politics looks like a pointless exercise. One way out of
that is to either create a new party that transcends the GOP as the
opposition or infiltrate the Republican party. The former solution is
the dreaded third-party route and the latter is the “reform within”
approach. Chris Roberts at American Renaissance [points
out](https://www.amren.com/blog/2020/11/the-american-rights-thirty-years-war/)
that neither is a new idea.

Taking over the GOP has proven to be impossible for the same reason
reforming Washington has proven to be impossible. If you have a
leadership that is so corrupt it needs reform forced upon them, you have
a leadership that is so corrupt they will find a way to thwart reform.
It’s like forcing a lion to be vegan. It is so against its nature that
it will just eat the keeper, rather than accept fake food. This has been
the case for the Republican Party going back to Pat Buchanan.

The third-party route has the same problem. The system has been designed
to prevent outside challenges. Both establishment parties take turns
playing the loyal opposition, so that discontent with official policy is
funneled into one side or the other. That way the discontent is recycled
as fuel for the establishment. Generations of conditioning have made
white people hostile to third parties. Even if a third party were to
succeed, they would face what Trump faced as a reformer in Washington.

Roberts suggests a third option in which people focus on narrow
interests and press those interests within the system. He points to
various pressure groups that have had varying degrees of success. The
NRA has probably been the most successful of the groups named, because
it has influence within both parties. In this model, whites can press
issues like immigration or economic reform in a bipartisan way, rather
than hoping to make these platforms in one political party.

This approach could be described as the Kulak option. The Kulaks were
peasants at the end of the Russian Empire who owned their own land. As
the revolution rolled on, the term came to mean property holder,
especially those who were hesitant to support the Bolsheviks, but were
also unwilling to side with the peasants. The kulaks would chastise the
peasants for not supporting the revolution, but they were never
completely onboard with giving up their land in service of the
revolution.

In this age, the Kulaks are those who view politics merely as a way to
protect their diminishing economic and social status. These are people
in the upper middle-class, economically and culturally. That last bit is
vital to understanding the most bourgeois class in modern America.
Flattery is the mother’s milk of this group. No people need to be told
they are a good boy, a very good boy more than the white professional
class. It is why they recoiled at Trump’s lower-class aesthetics.

These people are willing to embrace half measures in the same way the
Kulaks were willing to meet the Bolsheviks halfway. It’s not that they
hate white people or the cause of white people. It’s that they think it
is icky to be seen on the same stage as people who shop at Walmart. This
is the group that first fell for using grimy canvas sacks to tote their
groceries and now wear their mask while driving their foreign sedan. For
them, moderation in politics is a moral signifier.

This is where single issue politics comes into play. Some of these
people can get behind immigration reform, not for racial reasons but for
fairness reasons. It is unfair to current immigrants to leave the spigot
open. They can back tough trade policy, because globalism is bad for
minorities. Many of these people supported Trump as a social statement,
but abandoned him in 2020 as a social statement. Like the Kulaks, they
could not fully support the forces of change.

What this means is the people with the money to fund a reform movement
will always want a firm hand on the leash. This is why the Republican
Party is never willing to press their advantage or follow through with
their promises. The people who they rely upon for funding resist
anything that puts their interests at risk, but mostly they resist
anything that offends their elevated sense of self. As a result, their
politics are ceremonial. It is about where you stand on the stage,
rather than what you do on it.

Of course, the dissident project is about bringing people over the great
divide and part of that journey is the realization that dissidents are
the radicals now. The people calling themselves radicals are just
deluded tools of the establishment. Antifa and BLM should have corporate
sponsors on their outfits like sports teams. The real radicals are those
standing outside the prevailing moral and civic orthodoxy, questioning
the very basics of the liberal democratic project.

Like those old Bolsheviks, who courted support from the Kulaks, and
their urban analogs <a
href="https://www.firstthings.com/article/2020/10/suicide-of-the-liberals"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the intellects</a>, dissidents
need to appeal to upper middle-class whites in order to advance the
cause. Because this group responds primarily to symbolism and moral
signifiers, the appeal can and must be superficial. It is a means to an
end. They want to be part of something that promises change, but never
threatens their position. In time, they will be forced to choose or the
choice will be made for them.
