This month was the 40th anniversary of the United States Olympic hockey
team beating the Soviets and winning the gold medal. The sports channels
have done some segments on it, bringing back some of the young men, who
are now old men, to talk about their experiences. Some of the players
have shown up with Trump out on the campaign trail. The movie Miracle on
Ice, a “fact-based” depiction of what happened with that team is getting
replayed on the various services.

The win over the Soviets is one of the greatest upsets in sports
history. That’s not an overstatement based in nostalgia or latent
patriotism. The Russians were the best hockey team on the planet and it
was not close. They had won everything for twenty years and had not lost
to the Americans since 1960. They had done a barnstorming tour of the
NHL the year before and beat several NHL teams handily. Any team beating
them in that Olympics was going to need a miracle.

The Americans, in contrast, were college kids assembled for the
tournament. Younger people cannot appreciate this, but at the time there
was some national pride in the fact that America relied on amateurs in
the Olympics. “The only reason the Russians do so well is they are using
professionals” was a common refrain. It had the added benefit of being
true. The Soviet bloc countries used full-time athletes, who did nothing
other than train for their sport. They were professionals.

To put it in perspective, imagine a college team today beating a team of
NHL all-stars or an amateur golfer winning a major tournament. Think of
some implausible combination of events in your favorite sport and you
have an approximation of the enormity of this upset of the Russians. The
American team averaged twenty-two years old. They had played together
for a couple of months. The average Russian player had been on the team
ten years. It was literally men against boys.

Of course, the reason it still resonates with Americans old enough to
remember the event is the cultural and political impact. Carter was
still president and the country was in a deep spiritual depression. The
nation’s leaders regularly talked about how the good times were over and
it was all downhill for America. We were just going to have to get used
to be losers. After the disastrous 1960’s and 1970’s, that really did
not strike most people as wrong. America had killed itself.

More importantly, there was a sense, promulgated by the
<a href="https://berniesanders.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Left</a> at the time, that the Soviets were on the
winning side of history. Communism was on the advance, while capitalism
was on the defense. The number of countries falling under the spell of
communism was increasing. The Soviets had just invaded Afghanistan and
the Iranians had made a mockery of American power. It is hard to believe
it in hindsight, but serious people really did think it was over for
America.

I was a boy in that time and I recall my grandfather telling me that I’d
surely live long enough to see
<a href="https://berniesanders.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">communism in America</a>. He’d talk about the number of
countries that had gone over to that side. He’d point out the nature of
the American Left and how it was mostly focused on destroying the white
middle-class. He would say, “Communism is a war on the middle, waged by
those at the top using us at the bottom.” His opinion was not out of the
ordinary for the time.

The Americans beating the Russians and then beating Finland to capture
the gold was a transformative event. All of a sudden. everyone had a
reason to be proud and more important, be proud in public. It was a
great example of the cascading effect. Everyone suddenly realized that
lots of other people harbored the same thoughts as they did about the
state of things. Those
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR56GJ05IMs"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">chants</a> of “U-S-A” still
bring chills to anyone old enough to have watched that Olympics. It was
amazing.

Young people today get mad at old people for hanging onto the old civic
nationalism, thinking they are just deliberately obtuse. There is some
of that, for sure, but the real magnetic power of civic nationalism is
patriotism. The feeling people had in the days following that win over
the Russians was the best thing most American had ever experienced as
Americans. Everyone was talking about it. “Can you believe we beat the
Russians” was said over and over in joyous disbelief.

Those old enough to remember that time and what it was like to feel
genuine love of country, should be forgiven for not wanting to close the
door on it. There are few things that rival the bliss that comes from
genuine national pride. Not only wanting that feeling for yourself, but
for your descendants is not unreasonable. Preferring to look back to
when such a thing was plausible, rather to a future of angry
caterwauling by ungrateful browns, is perfectly understandable.

Old people should not be so quick to condemn the young people for
mocking Baby Boomers or criticizing civic nationalism. At the root of
that mockery is a bitterness at knowing they can never experience what
their ancestors experienced. There will be no miracle on ice for the
young. The social capital that made such a thing possible was converted
into money and traded away by global capitalism. They have a right to be
bitter over what their ancestors bequeathed them.

For those of us young at the time, this anniversary is a reminder of the
strange divide in our timelines. One side of the timeline is the *before
times*, when being a patriotic America was exhilarating. Then there is
the *after times*, the *now times*, when such feelings seem absurd.
Looking back over that great divide to this particular event is a
strange feeling, because it’s like remembering yourself as a foreigner,
living in a strange and foreign land. Your past is now alien to you.

That is the duty of those who have made the journey over the great
divide to dissident politics, but still remember when the other side had
promise. The America that made possible the miracle on ice had promise.
It could have been a great nation. Instead, the people in charge chose
to leverage our patriotism, monetize our social capital, so a handful of
alien money-changers could turn themselves into potentates. They can
never be forgiven for what they have taken from us. Never forget.
