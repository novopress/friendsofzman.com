One of the stranger things about modern times is the war on the
language. In English speaking countries it is close to tipping into
insanity. In other countries with more reverence for their language, it
is not as far along. The French have always been an odd exception to
this part of Cultural Marxism. They jealously hang onto their language
and resist the importation of foreign words. <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">They even have a government
department</a> working to keep English out of their language.

But, that does not mean their Cultural Marxists cannot make war on the
language too. <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Consider this story</a> about
recent labor rules.

*According to <a
href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/no-afterwork-emails-orders-french-labour-deal/story-fnb64oi6-1226878661655#"
rel="nofollow">The Australian</a>, a new French labor deal — which is a
legally binding deal signed by employers’ federations and unions
representing workers in the digital and consultancy sectors — says that
employees are to shut off work devices and avoid work emails after going
home for the day.The ruling applies to all companies in the technology
and consultancy sectors. It was brought forth after a study found that
39 percent of workers and 77 percent of managers used their smartphones,
tablets and computers for work purposes in the evenings, during weekends
and even on holidays.*

Think about that for a second. France is run by a socialists, who
regularly brand “the far right” as fascists. Fascism, as an economic
model, is based on corporatism. Specifically it is based on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripartism"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tripartism</a>, where the
state brings labor and business together to the benefit of all three.
The argument is the state coordinates capitalism, while protecting the
interests of labor, thus advancing the goals of the state.

That’s exactly what the French are doing here with this new law. The
state is not arbitrating a specific dispute between a company and its
employees. It is functioning as the third partner to labor and business.
It is the very same economics of fascist Italy, without the nationalism.
France, like most of Europe, has abandoned nationalism for
internationalism. They embrace internationalist fascism

We’re all fascists now.
