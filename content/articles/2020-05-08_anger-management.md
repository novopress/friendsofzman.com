I don’t know about anyone else, but I am finding that my patience is
running thin with everything that is going on with the virus. I’ve never
been much of a television watcher, but I still catch Tucker’s monologue
a few times a week. I’ve stopped that this week as I cannot take another
ad from a corporation telling me how much they care and how hard they
are working on my behalf. I can’t take anymore nonsense about hero
nurses and doctors. In fact, I’m starting to become a nursist.

Going outside has now become a depressing reminder that we now live in
an explicitly authoritarian society. It used to be a very soft,
passive-aggressive authoritarianism that you could ignore while enjoying
your life. Now it is an in-your-face corporate authoritarianism that is
impossible to ignore. On a trip to get supplies, it is a constant
reminder of Theodore Dalrymple’s [famous
quote](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/67950.Theodore_Dalrymple)
about communism. Not even the quiet revenge fantasy on the commute eases
the burden.

When this started, my sense was the panic would peak around Easter and
then begin to decline as the obvious became obvious. The politicians
would see the damage they were causing and panic in the other direction.
The public would quickly figure out that a disease with a 99% survival
rate was a risk worth taking in order to put food on the table and a
roof over their head. By now we would be a in mad dash to talk ourselves
into believing everything would get back to normal.

I was wrong about that. Some states are trying to break loose from the
spell, but most seem to like what’s happening. They are feverishly
looking around for reasons to extend these restrictions into the summer.
Not only that, they are dreaming up new torments in the name of “keeping
us safe.” A local grocer here in Lagos now takes everyone’s temperature
before they enter. They also limit the number of people in the store at
any one time, which means there is a block long line to enter.

It is tempting to think that people will finally have enough and put an
end to this madness, but that is a fantasy. The few brave souls taking a
stand are getting support, for sure, but the bulk of the public is happy
to be treated like children. You can be sure the majority oppose the
protests at state capitals. Until the food runs out and the machine
breaks, people will accept unlimited torment. That means we are left to
hope for the end times if we want to escape this madness.

Of course, being wrong about the track of the panic means I could be
wrong about people’s attitudes right now. Maybe the bulk of the public
is quietly seething. It’s hard to know since everyone is locked inside,
but it is possible. The support for that hairdresser in Texas suggests
some people have had enough. Maybe a few more abuses like that are what
it will take to get people angry enough to stop caring about the rules.
That’s what it takes in these times. People need to get mad as Hell.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
below.
