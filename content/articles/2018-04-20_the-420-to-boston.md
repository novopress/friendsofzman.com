Even though spring is not in the air here in Lagos, the hints of it are,
so I am feeling a bit more optimistic about things this week. I like
winter, but I like spring and summer too. It is this weird in-between
season that I don’t like very much. It’s not winter, but it is not
spring either. As I type this I see frost on the car. Yesterday it was
windy, cold and I saw some snow flurries. That said, Old Man Winter is
on his way out, I can just feel it.

Even if you like winter, there is something about the change of seasons
that brightens the mood. There’s a sense of anticipation about it. You
have to wonder how this changed people over a thousand generations.
Those who evolved in tropical climates never experienced the extremes of
weather Eurasians experienced, nor the anticipation of the change of
seasons. It has to have had some impact on our cognition.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. Of course, the Hitler Phones are so slow now, you may never
finish. YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a
download link below.
