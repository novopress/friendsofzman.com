This week I decided to do some housekeeping. I started looking at the
lists I keep for posting and podcasting with an eye on doing some
year-end cleanup. This time of year, I like to take some time to
reorganize and reset. I noticed on my podcast list that I had some stray
items and leftovers that I was probably never going to use, so some
housekeeping was in order. That is when it occurred to me that maybe I
could bundle all of them into a single show. That way I would not
discard them entirely.

The result this week is a show about things you should avoid doing.
These are all ideas I thought about using for different topics, but they
never quite fit. The first segment, for example, was something I thought
about in the show on fascism, but it was left on the cutting room floor,
as the professionals say. The last segment is something I thought of
using in a show about popular culture, but I decided I did not care
enough about popular culture to do a whole podcast on it. This show is a
hunter’s stew, of sorts.

Tonight at 8:00 PM EST I am scheduled to be the [Josh Neal live
stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auhQDTMv9z0). I don’t know a
whole lot about him, but he seems to be interviewing people involved in
dissident politics, so I figured it would be fine. His list of topics to
discuss is free will, the near future of dissident politics and my
thoughts about Donald Trump. The show will last about 90 minutes, and
you can watch it at any time. Given that this livestream will happen
during my designated drinking time, it should be an entertaining
episode.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I have been
de-platformed by Spotify, because they feared I was poisoning the minds
of their Millennial customers.
