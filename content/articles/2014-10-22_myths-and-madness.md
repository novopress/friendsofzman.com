Crackpots are often entertaining, but they are usually just tiring. A
guy who thinks dinosaurs once had a sophisticated society, but were
obliterated by space aliens in order to give mammals a shot is probably
a fun guy at the bar. The Brits used to call these sorts of eccentrics
“mad” or “daft”, as in harmlessly nutty.

At the other end of the spectrum, you have the sort that you suspect is
one nudge away from going bonkers and shooting up a mall. These are the
guys sending angry letters to the editor of their local newspaper –
every day. Nowadays, they show up on Facebook and

Or, they get a PhD and <a

*The American Renaissance Foundation is an extremely
<span style="color: #ff0000;">conservative</span>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">right-wing</span> organization that also
publishes a monthly magazine of the same name, American Renaissance
(AR). The magazine’s first issue appeared in November 1990. The
foundation was established by Jared Taylor (1952–) who serves as
president of the New Century Foundation and as editor of AR. Taylor has
ties to a variety of domestic and international
<span style="color: #ff0000;">racists</span> and
<span style="color: #ff0000;">extremists</span>. He is on the editorial
advisory board of Citizens Informer, the newspaper of the Council of
Conservative Citizens, a virulently
<span style="color: #ff0000;">racist</span> group whose website has
referred to blacks as “a retrograde species of humanity.” He has
contributed writings to The Occidental Quarterly, a
<span style="color: #ff0000;">racist</span> journal. He also has been a
member of the board of directors of the National Policy Institute, a
self-styled <span style="color: #ff0000;">racist</span> think tank, and
has received funding from this institute.*

*Taylor has close ties with members of various
<span style="color: #ff0000;">neo-Nazi</span> groups and with Gordon
Baum, the CEO of Council of Conservative Citizens. He is a frequent
radio guest of Don Black’s, operator of Stormfront, a
<span style="color: #ff0000;">white supremacist</span> online forum that
also advertises American Renaissance conferences. He also has ties to
Mark Weber, head of the Institute for Historical Review. European
<span style="color: #ff0000;">racists</span> are among his close
associates, including members of the British National Party, a
<span style="color: #ff0000;">racist</span>,
<span style="color: #ff0000;">far-right</span> political party in
England, and the National Front, a
<span style="color: #ff0000;">racist</span>,
<span style="color: #ff0000;">far-right</span> political party in
France. Nick Griffin, the head of the British National Party, has been a
speaker at two American Renaissance conferences. Frédéric Legrand, a
member of the National Front, is a frequent contributor to American
Renaissance.*

In those 263 words, I highlighted 14 scare words. It reads like
something written by the Lyndon LaRouche people. I was expecting some
reference to Henry Kissinger and his international communist ties. This
is the sort of rant you expect to be hand written on note paper, folded
up a bunch of times and then stuffed into a plain envelope. If you read
the whole 3,000 word tirade you start to think the guy already has Jared
Taylor tied up in his basement and this piece includes his demands.

I know next to nothing about Jared Taylor. I recall Derb writing about
him once so I went to the
<a href="http://www.amren.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">American
Renaissance</a> site. I find white identity to be a bit silly for the
same reasons I black identity to be ridiculous. Not all blacks are the
same and not all whites are the same. In America, blacks at least share
a common ancestry and history. You can reasonably argue that there is a
“black culture” that is shared by all black people. You can’t say that
about whites. Flinty guys from New Hampshire are not a lot like
Scots-Irish in Georgia. Then you have all the Poles, Irish, Italians,
Jews, Germans and so forth. There’s simply no such thing as white
identity.

That said, it is a harmless eccentricity. I’m more concerned about
deranged crackpots like Robert Wald Sussman than some old white guys
getting together to bitch about the “darkies.” Imagine the poor kids who
foolishly take his course only to find they will be getting harangued
three times a week by an aging madman.
