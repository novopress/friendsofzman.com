My first week back had me in the car most of the week, running around
between Philly and Washington. I try not to do much driving these days,
as the traffic in this area is the worst. In the DC area, people face
two and three hour commutes that can turn into four and five hour
commutes. The combination of having not driven much around here and
having been driving around Denmark made for a striking contrast. Last
night, I had close to four hours on the road before getting home to
finish the show.

I knew I might get caught up in traffic, so I did most of the recording
on Wednesday night. That way I would not be up all night if I got home
late on Thursday. It was a good call as I got home around eight. By the
time I stopped seething with rage, it was close to nine before I got
started. I think if I had to deal with long commutes every day, I’d quit
my job and find something else, even if it meant poverty. I used to have
an hour commute and that was hell. I can’t imagine two and three hour
commutes to work.

Sitting in traffic at some point, it occurred to me that parts of
America may already be seizing up, as a practical matter. In Northern
Virginia, traffic jams are pretty much constant during the daylight
hours. If you want a quick trip in that area, it means doing it in the
dead of night. That means the people spend more time in traffic than
they do at home with their families during the week. That’s not living.
That’s being a minor gear in a machine that is slowing grinding to a
halt. Even bugmen have better lives.

Of course, here in Lagos, there are large swaths of the city that are
off-limits to normal people, as a practical matter. That has an impact
on traffic patterns. Roads that were never intended to have heavy
traffic are snarled, as people look for a way to avoid driving through
the ghetto, especially in the evening. That’s on top of the roads that
were built for traffic loads a third of what they have now. The traffic
is not as bad as some parts, but it gets worse every year, with no
relief in sight.

I forget where I was, but I started to think about the last time I
recalled seeing new road building in the area. Nothing came to mind. I
then tried to recall the last large scale project on the east coast that
was intended to ease traffic. The only thing that came to mind was the
Big Dig in Boston, which was completed a dozen years ago. I may be all
wrong on this, but I bet a politician could get a lot of votes by
promising to build new roads and bridges, possibly even a big beautiful
wall along the border.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
