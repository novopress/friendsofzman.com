I was listening to a Boston sports radio station over the internet today
and I heard an ad for the
<a href="http://www.newenglandcannabisconventions.com/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">New England Cannabis Convention</a>. It’s possible that
this is an internet-only ad, but lots of people listen on-line these
days so I’m not sure that matters. That means these ads are hitting a
broad audience, even if it is not over the public airwaves. Apparently,
the station thought it was OK to run ads for this thing, since it is
legal in the state. Why not?

Imagine a parent on the way home with their pre-teen kids, listening to
the radio. This ad comes on and there’s not much the parent can do about
it. Turn off the radio and the kids will take note. Leave it on and the
kids have to hear about the exciting new world of weed dealing. Parents
have been talking about drugs and alcohol with their kids for a couple
of generations now, I would assume. By the early 70’s parents knew their
kids would be exposed to street drugs, in addition to booze. Their
natural ally was the fact drugs were illegal. Now, they are cautioning
against something that is celebrated.

That’s always been the issue with drug legalization that gets ignored.
Prohibition does not reduce use only by raising prices and reducing
supply. When you ban something, a stigma is associated with it. After
all, why ban something that is morally good?  When you legalize
something, the stigma is lifted. Anti-smoking campaigns took decades to
stigmatize smoking. Even so, they needed the law to step in and ban the
practice from most public places. In some jurisdictions, smoking is
allowed only in your own home.

The legalization of cannabis will come with all sorts of surprises like
that advertisement I heard on the radio. Half a century of prohibition
means all sorts of customs and institutions have grown up expecting
drugs to be illegal. Pull the pin of legalization and all sorts of
unexpected things get damaged in the explosion. The pro-legalization
people only see the potential upside of legalization. The big important
stuff, however, is always the stuff you don’t see.

What that ad for the convention makes quite clear is that the goal of
the weed community to to attract more weed users. If you tried to have a
tobacco convention, using Joe Camel to pitch your show, the cops would
throw you in jail. The weed crowd is, so far, immune from these laws, so
they are doing what any business does. They are advertising and trying
to increase their customer base. That means we will have a lot more pot
smoking and that means more of the problems that come from pot smoking.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKhukbe_VkE" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Sensible people</a>, who have argued for legalization,
have also acknowledged that it would bring an increase in drug use.
Forty years ago when Milton Friedman was making that case, we had three
TV channels, analog phones tethered to the wall and AM/FM radios.
Advertising, marketing and “socializing” a product was greatly limited
relative to today. Imagine your kids getting text message from the local
pot dispensary with the
<a href="http://www.cheebachews.com/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">daily specials aimed at a more youthful audience</a>.

I think the data from Colorado is pretty clear that legalizing cannabis
will result in an explosion of cannabis use. The power of science and
modern business techniques means many more people are going to be high
in the workplace, school, at the mall, etc. Doing bong hits requires
privacy while munching on a THC-laced candy can be done at your kid’s
soccer game – by the coaches. I’m not imagining reefer madness, but I’m
thinking we better get used to dealing with stoners in our every day
life.
