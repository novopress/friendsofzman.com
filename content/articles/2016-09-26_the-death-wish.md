A few times a month, I get an e-mail soliciting my opinion on Israel or
on Antisemitism. Often, these queries are in the context of a question
about one facet of the ideological landscape. “Why do you think Jews
support liberals, even though liberals hate Israel?” I have not
tabulated the results, but my guess is I get more questions about Israel
than any single topic, despite the fact I never write about Israel. I’d
have to check, but I don’t think I have ever posted about Israel. If I
have, it would most certainly be in the context of the Arab world.

My limited interest in the Jewish people is purely biological and
cultural. By that I mean I find it interesting that the Ashkenazim have
wildly out-performed their numbers in the United States. Jews are about
1% of the US population, but they dominate the law, academics,
entertainment and finance. When 1% of the population is 30% of the
richest people in the country, that’s phenomenal. There’s also the fact
that you really cannot understand the world without understanding
religion and that means understanding the role of Judaism and
Christianity, <a

The preceding is just a little background for the new readers who may
not be as familiar with my work as others. That way I can talk a little
about this segment on <a

target="_blank">John Derbyshire’s latest broadcast</a>.

I have been reading and listening to John for decades and I think he
captures his, as well as most people’s attitude, perfectly. I’m not fond
of rank anti-Semitism, any more than I’m a fan of racism, but my
definitions are more narrow and specific than they are today so maybe
John is correct to say he is an anti-anti-Semite. I don’t know a word
for being an anti-racist that does not imply lunacy, but maybe there is
one. My view is people are tribal and they will have tribal prejudices.
There’s no hectoring that away.

The whole segment is best listened to rather than read, as John’s
intonations convey additional meaning to the words. The reason for my
interest here is what he has to say at the bottom regarding the
anti-Trump phenomenon.

As someone without much of an interest in Semitism or Antisemitism, this
struck a nerve. I too have noticed that the people opposing Trump most
viciously all have familiar last names. Lots of gold and silver in the
\#nevertrump clown car. This has always struck me as illogical. Trump is
our most Jewish presidential candidate in my lifetime. He has always
been a big supporter of Israel and he is more than a bit famous for
socializing and doing business with the Jewish business community in
America.

It is a good reminder that there is always a portion of every population
that has a death wish. They agitate for things that are against the
interests of their ethnic group and they are more concerned with
strangers than their own family. Jews are no exception. Progressivism is
increasingly anti-Semitic and anti-Israel. Trump and his voters are very
much the opposite. Yet, that causes the Jennifer Rubins of the world to
hate him even more intensely than one would consider rational.
Self-loathing is a powerful drug.

There is a temptation to assume there is an anti-Christian vibe to what
we are seeing from people like Brett Stephens and Jennifer Rubin. That’s
not the case as they reserve special hatred for orthodox and
ultra-orthodox Jews. This is where the self-loathing becomes more clear,
These people sneer at the guys in the black hats and tzitzit hanging
out. If there is any anti-Christian sense to this, it stems from the
fact that American Christians are enthusiastic supporters of Israel and
virulent anti-anti-Semites.

The point here is that John is correct that these people are haunted by
the hoof beats, but they also wish they would return. The longing for
death, the death of their people, is what makes them tick. There’s some
element of this in all people. It’s just that Jews have been wildly
successful in America so their death wish gets played out on TV, while
the self-loathing Poles have to nurse their death wish in private.
Luckily for all of us, most Jews are not crazy and <a

blowing</a>.
