There is a big NATO summit going on in Washington right now and the main
focus of the meeting is what to do about Ukraine.
<a href="https://x.com/RealSaavedra/status/1810796906093891895"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is Biden talking about doing
something with the wife of the NATO Secretary General and then
<a href="https://x.com/BehizyTweets/status/1810806236255818079"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">calling</a> him an “intellectual wigger”
for some reason. Perhaps Biden thinks this will get him more support in
the black community or perhaps he has no idea where he is, but that is
part of the background noise of this summit.

The point of NATO, formed up after the Second World War, was to keep
Germany down, the Russians out and the Americas in. It is just assumed
that NATO is an American creation, but it was created by the UK and
France. The Treaty of Dunkirk was signed by France and the United
Kingdom on 4 March 1947 with the express purpose of mutual defense in
case of attacks by Germany or the Soviets. The real purpose was to bind
the United States to Europe forever.

This formula worked throughout the Cold War, as the Red Army sitting on
the border of Western Europe was a daily reminder for why the so-called
free nations of Europe needed to stick together and under the protective
shield of America. The fact that it was highly unlikely that the Soviets
would move into Europe was never considered, as the threat was simply
too convenient. The Warsaw Pact was formed almost a decade later in
response to the formation of NATO.

This should be ancient history, as the Soviet Union is gone and the Cold
War has been over for more than a generation, but it helps explain the
present psychosis that has gripped the NATO countries. For half a
century, their identity and therefore the reason for their political and
economic elites to exist was based in this fear of the Russians flowing
across the border. What it meant to be European came to mean fear of the
bear and the desperate clinging to the eagle.

In other words, European elites need the bear and the eagle, because who
they are literally and spiritually exist between the two. Much of what
passes for European diplomacy over the last decade or so has been an
effort to poke the bear into being the bear again and telling the eagle
that she is still that majestic eagle of yore. This is why the Europeans
flew into action at the start of the Ukraine war. Their reason to exist
had finally returned and there was cheering in every European capital.

The trouble is the eagle is too old to fly. Biden hosting what will most
likely be his last NATO summit is emblematic of the problem. The America
that beat the fascists and secured peace for half a century is no more.
The arsenal of democracy, like old family heirlooms of a once proud
dynasty, has been auctioned off to the highest bidder and like Biden, is
a shuffling husk of its former self. Biden mumbling crazy things on
stage is the perfect image for the current moment.

One cannot help but wonder how the alleged leaders of Europe can sit in
their chairs watching this desiccated husk cling to office and not see
the problem. An America that produces a leader like Biden is nothing
like the America that produced the young and reckless Kennedy or the
sharp and charming Reagan. How is it possible for these people to not
see what is plain to anyone who looks? How can they possibly think they
can and should tempt war with Russia?

Of course, the main reason is that the European elites are just as
dilapidated and broken down as the American elites. Look across Europe
and you cannot find anyone who would be allowed to shine the shoes of
great leaders of the past. Instead, it is managerial functionaries who
have been elevated into positions with impressive titles and no real
power because they are obsequious toadies. They may as well be actors
hired from the local circus.

In truth, they are actors. Europe, having been remade in the image of
the progressive masters across the sea, has the same problem we see in
American politics, which is a system that selects for people willing to
read their lines. It is why you never find anyone in European politics
who had a job in the dreaded private sector. That is a disqualifier on a
resume, so the politically ambitious avoid anything that requires
practical knowledge and instead work on their obsequiousness.

Amusingly, many of these so-called leaders claim the Ukraine war is an
existential crisis, apparently thinking “existential” means “external.”
Even more amusingly, they are correct despite not understanding what
they are saying. The Ukraine war is the result of an inner conflict in
Europe. To be European no longer has any meaning, so what is the purpose
of the institution set up to protect it? The so-called leaders have no
answer when asked, “why defend Europe at all?”

The proof of this is the steady invasion from the south. The people
terrified of an invasion from the east celebrate mass migration. So much
so that they are now rigging their elections to prevent any efforts to
stem the flow. Keir Starmer’s first act was to welcome boats full of
Africans to the UK. The unsaid truth at the NATO summit is the answer to
the question at the center of Europe’s existential crisis is suicide.
They will end the question of Europe by exterminating it.

Maybe in the end that is the final point of NATO. Just as the people who
run imperial foreign policy would rather blow up the world in a nuclear
Armageddon than see their ancient enemy prosper, the so-called leaders
of Europe would rather see the end of Europe than think about leading an
independent Europe. This NATO summit is Jonestown, and the leader
promising salvation is a deranged old man who everyone hopes brought the
Flavor Aid.
