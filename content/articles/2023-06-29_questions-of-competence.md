The crisis of competence has been a popular topic in dissident circles
but largely ignored by mainstream politics. Human intelligence is a
dangerous subject in this increasingly primitive time because it points
to immutable differences in human beings, which contradicts the new
religion. If who we are is determined by our genes, then many of the
popular social fads are invalid. This makes discussing the declining
competency of Western societies difficult.

Even so, the reality of the situation is hard to ignore, and we are
seeing more mainstream writers notice the topic. Here is a <a
href="https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/the-affirmative-action-regime/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> in the Claremont Review of Books
discussing one cause of the decline. While the article focuses on how
civil rights theology has warped the law, this warping of the legal
system is having a deleterious impact on society by reducing competence
to happy accident. When vague notions of social justice are primary,
competence is an afterthought.

The most recent Budweiser panic is a good example. The ethic inside the
company was built around notions of representation and equitable
outcomes. These magic phrases did not spring from nothing. They are
rooted in the same civil rights theology as the legal mechanism that
enforce diversity quotas. It is a straight line from expecting equal
outcomes to thinking you need to market cheap beer to crossdressers in
order to make sure everyone is represented in your marketing.

Instead of a company making cheap beer, imagine the same company making
airplane parts, elevator controls or military equipment. Competence is
just as essential to beer making as making any other product. There is
no reason to think that the company providing safety services to
airports is less concerned for their diversity goals than the company
making cheap beer. When diversity is our greatest strength, it means
competence is somewhere down the list.

Of course, the new religion is not the only cause of the crisis of
competence we are seeing throughout American society. This <a
href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/06/01/complex-systems-wont-survive-the-competence-crisis/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">long article</a> on the impact of
diversity quietly mentions another elephant in the room. While not
explicitly stated, the decline in intelligence brought on by immigration
is making it more difficult to maintain the complex systems of our
society. The millions moving to America are not fleeing well-run,
high-IQ, high-trust societies. They are the exact opposite.

Again, this is not a new topic on this side of the great divide. Here is
a <a href="https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=28299" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">post</a> from 2022 on how the decline in competence led
to the Ukraine war. Here is another
<a href="https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=28299" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">post</a> from last year going into the impact of the
general decline in IQ. In 2018 Ed Dutton and Michael Woodley wrote a <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/At-Our-Wits-End-Intelligent/dp/184540985X"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">book</a> on the topic of declining
Western intelligence. Quantitative bloggers and HBD commentators have
been talking about the impact of intelligence on society for decades
now.

There is a chicken and egg angle to all of this. Is the spread of the
new religion the prime mover of these observed phenomenon? For reasons
as yet explained, the ruling elite of the Global American Empire
embraced these vague notions of equity and diversity because they solved
some unexamined psychological need or maybe they were deemed useful in
promoting group solidarity. The resulting policies led to a decline in
competence and general intelligence.

On the other hand, material prosperity reduced the risks in life, which
resulted in more stupid people making it to sexual maturity. More of
these people were then able to reproduce thus increasing the percentage
of stupid people in society. Generation after generation the stupid
multiplied due to the work of the intelligent in making life safer for
the stupid. At a certain point, ideas like diversity and equity start to
make sense as the stupid begin to overwhelm the competent.

The best evidence in support of this theory is the social fads. You have
to be outlandishly stupid to think people are assigned a sex at birth.
In fact, stupidity alone does not explain this lunacy. It must be
amplified by a fanatical zeal to conform. In other words, people are not
just dumber, they are increasingly terrified of the world around them
and naturally seek safety in numbers. Western man has gone from being
wolves taking on nature to moronic sheep hiding from nature.

All of this reads like a warning, as if there is something that can be
done about the rapid decline in general competence. The immigration
people say that ending immigration will help arrest the decline, but it
is probably too late. Even if all immigration ends today, America
becomes majority-minority by 2050 at the latest. It would also take
competence to end immigration and we probably lack the ability to do it
now. In other words, we have passed the point of no return.

The question then shifts from what can we do about it to what happens as
the population loses the ability to maintain the social systems? For
example, you cannot have a rights-based political culture with a low-IQ,
low-trust population. You cannot leave people to question the rules and
be inventive when you have to fear the consequences of their
inventiveness. The Western way of organizing society can only work when
the population is smart and competent.

This raises another question. It is not as if the future will be
universal stupidity as it was  in the movie Idiocracy. The future is
going to be pockets of occidental competence in a sea of vibrant
stupidity. Will high IQ, homogeneous New Hampshire want to be in the
same country as diverse and stupid New Mexico? The former has an average
IQ of 103, while New Mexico comes in at 95. Throw in the language and
cultural barriers and you can see the problem.

This brings us to a final question stemming from the crisis of
competence. If we cannot have the social structure we had when America
was a European society, then what sort of social arrangements can we
have in the diverse and stupid future? What sort of society is possible
with the demographics of the future? Will all of the people of the
future accept such those arrangements? Will the rump occidental
population tolerate those conditions or seek to change them?
