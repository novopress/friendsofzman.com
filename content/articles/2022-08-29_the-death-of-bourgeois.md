things.

Spengler famously described a civilization as having a birth, life and
then a decline into death, much like the life of man. One of the
features of decline is the elite stops being elite in term of talent and
ability. They may sit atop society and hold power over the people, but
they are no longer a genuine elite. They simply hold positions in a
system created by those who came before them. They are the inheritors of
status that they did not earn and they lack the ability to earn.

This reality is becoming increasingly obvious as we see highly
credentialed morons stagger from one blunder to the next. Europe is
about to go into a modern version of the turnip winter because European
leaders picked a fight with Russia, the primary energy supplier to the
continent. The people leading Europe do not decorate themselves like
African potentates, but they are every bit as ridiculous. They are like
children wearing their parents clothes, pretending to be adults.

The decline of the elites has become so obvious that even some former
neocons are starting to notice the problem. Victor David Hanson has a <a
href="https://amgreatness.com/2022/08/21/the-worst-and-the-stupidest/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">piece</a> in American Greatness bemoaning
the decline of the elites. He clings to his old civic nationalists
beliefs, so that has left him in a no man’s land of sorts. He cannot
take the trip over the great divide, but he cannot sign onto the latest
thing. He is left to argue that better people at the top would somehow
fix the system.

What civic nationalist critics fail to see is the elite incompetnace is
a product of the system, rather than a plague upon it. The crisis in the
West is not caused by failed leadership but rather the elites are a
product of the same forces behind the general crisis in the West. A
bourgeoise culture evolved in the 20th century that naturally leads to a
flattening of talent. The elites seem mediocre because bourgeoise
society, taken to its logical end, is the celebration of mediocrity.

One part of it is democracy. The core assumption of democracy is that
all opinions are equally valid, if not equally correct. The former is a
moral claim while the latter is an empirical claim. The problem is you
cannot suppress a moral claim with a factual one, so bad opinions can
flourish like weeds alongside good ones. Before long it is impossible to
tell the good from the bad. In fact, any effort to pull the weeds from
the garden is met with howls of protest.

Of course, democracy in the modern sense is only possible in a society
with a large middle-class, like post-war America. Prior to the war,
egalitarian notions had little purchase in American society. Men were
equal before God and equal before the law, but few people confused that
with equality of talent. Nonwhites were systematically excluded from
everything important because whites naturally assumed they lacked the
ability to perform the duties of citizens.

The great explosion of middle-class life after the war changed that
view. In a world where most white people could expect a nice house in a
nice neighborhood and their kids would have a better life, natural
equality started making sense. As the bulk of white Americans entered
the material sameness of middleclass life, they began to adopt the
spiritual sameness of bourgeoise life. When the observed differences
were the result of effort, it is not a big leap to egalitarian civic
nationalism.

Late 20th century America became a bourgeois-ocracy. Middle-class values
dominated not just the popular culture, but elite culture. The world of
deeds gave way to the world of clever words. When the plumber’s house is
not that much different from the lawyer’s house, there has to be
something other than material prosperity to distinguish the lawyer from
the plumber. The result was a growing collection of soft things, moral
signifiers to distinguish people within the bourgeoise space.

As an aside, the drive to impoverish the middle-class is not the result
of a ravenous elite seeking to enrich itself. It is the result of an
insecure elite trying to create distance between itself and the vast
middle-class. Think of the college student that comes home with a nose
ring and blue hair. The point is to put space between herself and her
family with the exaggerated gesture. Our sophomoric elites are doing the
same things, except you will eat bugs and walk to work.

Putting that aside, this need to distinguish oneself within a system
that champions sameness is part of what drives the current thing. People
within the elite of a bourgeois-ocracy struggle to distinguish each
other within the elite. The reason they rush from one weird fad to the
next is the fear of melting into the bland, gray nothingness that is
bourgeoise culture. They are not weird for material gain or even spite,
but out of fear of being smothered by the great nothingness.

This excellent <a
href="https://www.firstthings.com/article/2020/10/suicide-of-the-liberals"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">essay</a> in *First Things* about the
intelligent is pre-revolutionary Russia gets at an aspect of this
phenomenon. In a world where deeds count for very little, the only thing
left is posturing. In pre-revolutionary Russia, liberals were happy to
sign on with the radical terrorist, even though they were often the
victims. The reason is the pose was a way to signal their existence.
They sided with radicals because that let them stand apart from the
crowd.

The modern intelligent, with her pronouns in her profile, is simply
hoping to create barriers in the gray nothingness. On the one hand, it
signals moral status within the gray nothingness of bourgeois life. On
the other hand, it creates the sense that there is a moral barrier to
entry. The gross people at Target do not use the proper pronouns, while
the cool people using Instacart never deadname anyone. The meaningless
gestures are supposed to give meaning in an otherwise meaningless
culture.

The crisis in the West is not due to faulty elites. The elites are the
product of a long decline into a bourgeois-ocracy. The replacement of
the vertical relations with horizonal ones was always unnatural and
unnatural things cannot last. The mediocre elites are just the natural
result of mediocre people spawned by the socio-political culture that
values mediocrity over greatness. Nature selects against the mediocre
and therefore the bourgeois-ocracy is trundling to its natural end.
