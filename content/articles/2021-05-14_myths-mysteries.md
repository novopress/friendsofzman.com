A topic I keep returning to is how the new fads sweeping our elites are
like primitive rituals rather than old time ideology. The Marxists
really thought their economic policies would result in plenty. On paper
at least, their plans made some sense. The new stuff is all mystery and
magic. If people chant certain things at certain times or places, then
something magical will happen. There is no attempt to create a logic
that connects the dots or explains the logic. They just believe.

That is what lies behind the critical race theory business. Read through
it and you see there is no plan of action or set of standards to be met.
There is no list of things that need to be done or not done. It is a
blend of graduate school jargon and feminized encounter sessions. If
everyone sits in the room and hears the gibberish from the lecturer,
somehow the fog of racism will lift. Or maybe it will never lift, and
the struggle will continue forever. No one knows or thinks about it.

Antiracism, like Nth-wave feminism, has become primal screams, bursts of
uncontrolled emotion and mysterious rituals. It is what Jacques Derrida
labeled hauntology, the persistence of elements from the past, as in the
manner of a ghost. In the case of antiracism, it is the ghosts of
slavery, colonialism, discrimination, the mean look from the white girl
in fifth grade that haunt the minds of the present. Antiracism has
become a battle with the past, that by definition can never end.

It is why none of it makes sense. Antiracism is a mystery cult. The
insiders have learned the language and those who refuse to learn the
language are the outsiders, the bad people stuck in the white
supremacist mindset. That is the appeal of antiracism for the white
people joining it. It is grace on the cheap. Learn some catchphrases,
attend a seminar, and show some enthusiasm. The prize is you get a black
person to bless you and bestow forgiveness. It is the prefect bourgeois
religion.

Hauntology is a useful term here because Derrida coined it in response
to Fukuyama’s these in the End of History. The old Left could never
accept that Marxism was a dead end, so they have had to conjure a way to
keep the faith alive. Something similar happened with race in America at
the end of the Cold War. For all practical purposes, racism ended in the
1980’s. That left the anti-racist with nowhere to go, so they conjured
the spirit of racism as a specter that now haunts the present.

Sweep away the jargon, however, and you are left with oogily-boogily. We
have people running around claiming that an organization is haunted by
white supremacy and the cure is a ritual to purge the evil spirits of
racism. We have the equivalent of a witch hunt for white supremacist.
Instead of cavorting with Old Scratch, they secretly commune with the
spirit of bad uncle. The only thing missing is spectra evidence, but
that will no doubt be presented in the future trials of heretics.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
