I was tempted to take this week off, given that it is the sacred holiday
of Juneteenth, a day when all white people are supposed to contemplate
their guilt. According to this newly minted ancient custom, whites are
supposed to sit at home with the shades drawn and the lights off. It’s
sort of like what Jews are supposed to do on their sabbath, except
there’s never any forgiveness or the possibility for salvation. This new
religion is a one-way street for white people. We’re all going to Hell.

While it is not official, you can be sure our corporate tyrants will try
hard to impose this holiday on us. It has already started. My bank is
closing early today in celebration of Juneteenth, a holiday they just
heard of last week. You can be sure the other global pirates will follow
suit for next year. Then there will be a push to make it a Federal
holiday, which will get no resistance. The reason for that is anyone who
would resist will be silenced or threatened, as Juneteenth intended.

Of course, this Juneteenth nonsense is just another vehicle for sowing
despair in the ranks of white people. It is a form of ethnic cleansing.
Historically, ethnic cleansing is accompanied by the destruction and
removal of the cultural and historical evidence of the targeted people.
We tend to focus on the murder and violence of the concept, but the real
crime is the destruction of that which ties the current people to their
ancestors and to one another. It is a program to steal their identity.

This is what we see all over America. The condition of white people is
as a conquered people, but one that still thinks they are in charge.
Popular culture is erasing all traces of whiteness. The corporate
tyrants are bombarding us with anti-white messaging through their ads
and conduct. If the people in charge were lizard people from another
planet, no one would be confused about what is happening. Everyone would
recognize all of this stuff as the acts of a conqueror.

It is not hard to see where they are headed with this Juneteenth thing.
In addition to black history month, June will turn into anger and
resentment month, with the 19th being the high holy day of anti-white
hatred. The gays will have to shift pride month to July, but maybe they
will get a holiday out of it too. The Stonewall gay riots carried into
early July, so maybe Independence Day is refashioned into gay liberation
day. It sounds insane, but just look around at what’s happening.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
