One costly side effect of spread of mass media is that likable stupid
people have the opportunity to spread nutty ideas. Walter Cronkite was a
hugely popular because he perfected the avuncular style that people
naturally trust. He seemed like a nice, thoughtful older man who was
only there to inform the viewers. We now know he was a pathological liar
and willfully misinformed his viewers on behalf of the Left

The cable news channels and network news operations are always looking
for that person who can gain the trust of the viewer. If they can peddle
the old time religion at the same time, that person is getting very rich
on TV. A good example on the Right is financial pundit Larry Kudlow. On
TV and radio he comes off as a super-nice, old financial hand, whose
wealth of experience makes him uniquely qualified to assess the economy.
He gets treated as a sage, despite being wrong about most of the things
he discusses.

For all his wrongness, he is a good bellwether. He can be counted on to
pitch the company line. In his case, the company is the GOP and the go
along to get along gang of Conservative Inc.
<a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101164217" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Seeing this today</a>, we can assume that the GOP will
be satisfied to say they are right, but otherwise do nothing to claw
back some of the last five years. The signals are being sent to the
party and its cheerleaders that the cost is clear. No one will expect
them to actually do anything once they have some power.

The usual suspects will churn out some books about how to repeal this or
reform that liberal policy. The GOP will offer up candidates long on
complaints about the welfare state, but short on desire to do anything
about it. The GOP will soon offer up a laundry list of things to fix it.
The dynamic of the next 15 years as the boomers age off will be one
where one party promises to fix it and the other promises to expand it.
The logic of it is now off-limits. Instead, we are looking at a long
losing fight against mathematics.

The line now from Conservative Inc is, “it will collapse under its own
weight.” That’s true, but it will take 15 years. In a business, pushing
off bankruptcy for fifteen years is a good thing. Most businesses don’t
last that long. For government, the longer reform is delayed, the worse
the cost of collapse is when it comes. In fifteen years, there will be a
lot of white people expecting their checks and a lot of brown people
expecting their free stuff. When the money runs out, things will get
ugly in a hurry.

That’s the insidiousness of social democracy. You get the benefits up
front, but push the cost way past the point when current office holders
are gone. Whatever the structure, democracy ends up as a some type of
tragedy of the commons. All of the incentives are for living in the
moment and pushing the costs off to the next generation. It’s why every
democracy ends in dictatorship. It’s also why the so-called
conservatives are just fraudsters. They know this, yet they go along
with it because it pays well.
