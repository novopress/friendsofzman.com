Baltimore is a majority black city with an all black government and
bureaucracy. Like Detroit, the government avoids plundering what wealth
is left only because they are too incompetent to steal what’s left.
There are pockets of rich whites and a small hipsterville, but otherwise
it is Lagos on the Chesapeake. But, they can’t help but jump on the <a

*Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake plans to unveil dozens of
recommendations Wednesday intended to lure immigrant families to
Baltimore and retain them.*

*The proposals, from increasing the availability of translators at city
agencies to making it easier for the undocumented to buy homes, offer
insight into the mayor’s pledge to attract 10,000 new families over the
next decade — an effort that is focused in part on the city’s burgeoning
immigrant neighborhoods.*

*“I want to make sure that Baltimore isn’t behind the curve on this
trend,” said Rawlings-Blake, who will formally announce the
recommendations today. “This is about taking advantage of the growth
that we’ve already seen.”*

*The proposals are part of a new report crafted by a city task force and
the Abell Foundation.*

*Census data show that 46,000 people in Baltimore were born in another
country, and 40 percent of them are naturalized citizens.*

*That represents a 55 percent increase in the number of people who
identified themselves as immigrants in 2000. Most analysts believe those
numbers significantly underrepresent the number of immigrants who
entered the country illegally.*

*The task force suggests the city should approve an ordinance requiring
agencies to develop policies that comply with federal regulations on
“language access” to ensure that those who don’t speak English can take
advantage of city programs.*

*And noting that potential homebuyers who don’t have Social Security
numbers often struggle to obtain mortgages, the panel also recommends
creating a committee to study programs that allow immigrants to borrow
instead with a Tax ID Number issued by the Internal Revenue Service.*

Again, why would any government want more poor people? The reason they
can’t get credit is they are not here legally and they have no money. It
is a crazy thing, but this is what extreme partisanship is like in a
late stage democracy. These people will self-harm just to be on the
right side and hold the right opinion.
