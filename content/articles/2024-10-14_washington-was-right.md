**Note:** Behind the green door I have a post about the death of
grammar, a post about life as a modern serf and the Sunday podcast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

George Washington famously observed, “The nation which indulges toward
another an habitual hatred or an habitual fondness is in some degree a
slave.” This was in his farewell address where he cautioned that one of
the risks to the new nation was from involvement in foreign affairs.
When a country aligns with another country, it not only takes on the
friends and enemies of that country, it opens the door for that country
to influence its leaders and shape its policy.

We see this writ large with Israel. Since the Bush II administration,
Israel has been seeking a way to get the United States to go to war with
Iran. They claim Iran is the cause of all the problems in the region.
Coincidentally, Iran also backs the two primary opponents of the Greater
Israel project, Syria and Hezbollah. Therefore, if the United States
takes out Iran, then peace will descend on the region and,
coincidentally, Israel will face no opposition to its expansion plans.

Bush II probably would have pulled the trigger on a war with Iran if the
Iraq war had not been such a debacle. The neocons were boasting in the
first term that once Iraq was made into a democracy, it would help
“liberate” Iran from its rulers. These plans we shelved once Obama came
to power, in part because of Valerie Jarrett, who was in favor of
normalizing relations with Iran. The neocons were also busy getting
Project Ukraine off the ground.

Depending upon whose narrative you prefer, the United States is either
abandoning Project Ukraine in order to deal with the Middle East or the
United States is getting sucked into a war with Iran and must abandon
Project Ukraine. Either way, it is becoming clear that war with Iran is
in the cards. The Israelis keep provoking the Iranians, who have no
choice but to respond. The Israelis then claim the response is an
unjustified attack so they must respond.

The last turn at this game was a genuine escalation as the Iranians
launched waves of ballistic missiles that were able to penetrate Israeli
air defenses. This by itself is a huge step in the process. No one
thought the Iranians had this ability. Add in the accuracy with which
they were able to target Israeli military facilities and the Israel –
Iran conflict moved much closer to all-out war. Israel promised massive
attacks against Iranian nuclear and energy facilities.

Now we get word that the United States is setting up the THAAD
anti-ballistic missile system in Israel. This is the most advanced air
defense system in the American arsenal and it is supposed to be capable
of defeating the best missiles. Of course, the Iron Dome was supposed to
be the best air defense system until it was defeated. The Patriot system
was also supposed to be a great system until it was destroyed by the
Russians in Ukraine as soon as it was deployed.

Reportedly, the Biden administration opposes attacks on Iranian nuclear
and energy facilities, but that could be a cover story. They reportedly
promised Iran that Israel would not retaliate to the Iranian drone
attack. Then Israel set off a string of targeted assassinations and the
famous pager attack. It is a good reminder that everyone involved in
Middle East politics is incapable of honesty. Everyone lies about
everything to everyone, even about the lies they are telling.

Regardless of intentions, this move now provides Israel with cover for
whatever attacks they have planned. This will inevitably mean Iran
launches another wave of missiles at Israel, maybe even targeting that
THAAD system. This is what happened with the Patriot system in Ukraine.
The Russians filled the sky with drones, so when the Patriot system lit
up, it became an easy target for Russian missiles. The use of air
defense systems makes them vulnerable to attack.

Even if the Iranians avoid striking this system, they have a lot of
missiles and the THAAD system is limited. Each battery is about forty
interceptors. Iran reportedly has thousands of missiles. Of course, like
everything to do with the Military Industrial Complex, the THAAD system
is <a
href="https://www.twz.com/11429/one-faulty-part-halted-thaad-interceptor-production-for-four-months"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">riddled</a> with corruption. It is a big,
complicated and expensive system no one expected to use in war, so it is
mostly a jobs and patronage program, rather than a weapon of war.

All that aside, it is easy to see that George Washington was correct.
Indulging habitual fondness for Israel has made the world’s lone
superpower a slave to whatever schemes the Israelis are plotting. The
United States is on the brink of war with Iran, solely because Israel
desires it. No one in Washington dares question any of this, as the
Israeli lobby is too powerful. Even the neocons, who prefer Project
Ukraine over Project Iran, are powerless against the Israel lobby.

War with Iran will be a disaster of the United States. The American
military can deliver devastating strikes against Iran, but Iran can also
close the Strait of Hormuz, sending global oil prices through the roof.
They could also attack oil facilities in the region, crippling global
supplies and sending the world into a depression. Only a madman would
want such a scenario, but this is the price that must be paid when you
chain yourself to the lunatic regime that is Israel.

Compounding things is the fact that no one knows who is actually running
foreign policy in the Biden administration. We know it is not Biden, due
to his declining health, but who is calling the shots is a mystery. It
is no doubt a mystery to Iran, as well. The Russians have made this
point regarding the Ukraine war. The result is the United States is the
Lennie Small to the Israeli George Milton as far the Iranians are
concerned, which means the United States no longer has agency.

This is exactly what Washington warned of in his farewell address. The
only way out of this degenerate relationship with Israel is a revolution
in how Washington deals with the entire region and that is impossible
due to the massive Israel lobby. When every Congressman has a minder
from Israel and every media outlet has to run their coy past AIPAC and
the ADL, there is no room to think about this clearly, much less have a
debate about this terrible situation.

This is why the way to bet is war with Iran after the November election.
The Biden people have no reason to care at that point and Israel will
see it as an opportunity to get what they have wanted for decades. The
next administration will have to pay the price for this reckless foreign
entanglement. Perhaps it is the price that must be paid for the end of
empire. Gas lines and ten-dollar gasoline will surely cause some to
question this habitual fondness for Israel, at least.
