If you were to go back in time to the 1980’s, scoop up a group of
conservatives and show them this <a
href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/national-conservatism-a-statement-of-principles/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> from the National Conservatives,
those retro-conservatives would be very confused. For starters. they
would be puzzled as to why such a thing was even necessary in 2022.
Surely by this late date everyone would know the general framework of
the American Right. More important, it would be the general framework of
the nation, given the trajectory of the conservative movement.

Once the present situation in America was explained to them, they would
no doubt want to know what went wrong? Was there a horrible calamity
that derailed conservatives and sent the nation reeling into
authoritarian degeneracy? Did the Left stage a revolt and seize the
country by force? Did we lose the Cold War? At this point, the room
would fall silent as none of the signatories of that post could provide
a coherent explanation for why things have gone so horribly wrong.

Many of them have been participating in a long running debate about what
fills the void left by the implosion of Buckley conservatism. A few
camps have formed up around various concepts. They all agree that
Buckley-style conservatism was a failure, but there has not been much
discussion about why it failed. In fact, they seem to think Buckley
conservatism was fine, as they make clear in that document. Again,
everything there was baseline conservatism in the 1980’s.

Those 1980’s conservatives would also be a bit puzzled by the names.
Once they got their bearings, they would quickly figure out that many of
their favorite conservatives in the 1980’s did not live to see 2022. New
voices would have come along to fill those spots, but surely some would
have made it. Which of these names are taking up the banner once held by
Sam Francis, Pat Buchanan and Paul Gottfried? It seems like those guys
were right about the direction of conservatism.

Imagine the shock when it was explained that those guys were not only
purged from conservatism but pre-emptively purged from the new
conservatism. Sure, this statement of principles is being posted in a
magazine founded by Pat Buchanan, but not a single name on that list
would want his name in the same sentence with Buchanan or any of the
other guys from the 1980’s who turned out to be right. In fact, many
have denounced the old paleos as immoral.

There is something to be said for getting back to basics in a time of
stress, so this statement of principles makes sense for a group that
largely seems dedicated to going back in time and starting over. By
embracing what was standard issue conservatism in the 1980’s, they are
hoping to reset the movement and install themselves at the top, with all
the benefits that come from it. That means their central claim is that
real conservatism has never been tried.

It is in that document, however, where you see the seeds of failure
within the old Buckley-style conservatism. The first principle starts
with “We wish to see a world of independent nations.” It finishes with
“We endorse a policy of rearmament by independent self-governing nations
and of defensive alliances whose purpose is to deter imperialist
aggression.” The fact that this obvious contradiction was not obvious to
the signers suggests they have leaned nothing from failure.

As George Washington explained in his farewell address, a nation cannot
remain independent when it forms alliances with other nations. As
history makes clear, when you agree to defend Poland from its enemies,
you inherit the enemies of Poland, even if that contradicts the
interests of your people. Washington correctly argued that “inveterate
antipathies against particular nations, and passionate attachments for
others, should be excluded.”

One can maybe debate this point within the larger debate about
conservatism, but there is no debating the bit about deterring
imperialist aggression. The sole source of imperialist aggression in the
world today is the Global American Empire. By the reasoning in that
first principle, the world should unite in opposition to the United
States and perhaps even the collective West. You can be certain that not
a single signer of that document would agree with that point.

Of course, it is the last point where they give the game away. This is
surely the contribution of Yoram Hazony, who seems to lack even a high
school level understanding of human biology. Instead, he just accepts
the far-left claim that race is skin color and that biology is a social
construct. Whether he really believes this is open to debate, given that
he is an Israeli, but he makes a point of denying biological reality
whenever the opportunity arises.

That last principle is worse than ignorant, it is traitorous. These are
the guys claiming to defend the tradition, history and culture of the
people. At the same time, they insist “The history of racialist ideology
and oppression and its ongoing consequences require us to emphasize this
truth.” Really? Who are those racist oppressors? Is it the guys whose
statues lie in ruins? Is it the guys lying in graves desecrated by
left-wing goons bellowing about the history of racialist ideology?

This gets to the failure of Buckley-style conservatism. At some point,
Buckley figured out that he could enjoy the lifestyle he deserved by
conceding the moral high ground to the people he claimed to oppose. Once
he conceded that basic point, he condemned himself to a lifetime of
performing as a useful idiot for the benefit of his masters on the Left
and he condemned his movement to failure. There is simply no room for
conservative ends within the left-wing moral framework.

A nation is a people, not a collection of abstract concepts. Within a
nation there can be a fair degree of variance, but relative to other
people the differences are tiny from the perspective of outsiders. To a
Swede, a Finnish atheist is no different than a Finnish Lutheran or
Finnish pagan. They are just Finns. On the other hand, no one, not even
these egalitarian nationalists, would confuse a Finn for an African.
That is because they are obviously different people.

Finally, what this and the larger discussion within the group debating
the future conservatism reveals is they have learned nothing. That is
because they have not bothered to think about why conservatism failed.
Perhaps the danger that lies in such a project is the issue. Maybe they
lack the intellectual firepower to tackle it. Either way, repeating the
slogans of the past, hoping to recreate the past is called a cargo cult,
not a serious political movement.
