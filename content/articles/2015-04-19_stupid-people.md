Way back in the olden thymes, I became acquainted with the phrase
“pseudo-intellectual poseur.” The person using it was a very liberal
person aiming it at some other liberal person. I no longer remember why
I was privy to this bum fight, but the phrase stuck with me. The Brits
have an old word that conveys a similar sentiment. George Galloway once
called Chris Hitchens “a drink-soaked former Trotskyist *popinjay*.”

As in all of these progressive bum fights, the person hurling the
accusation is most likely projecting what they hate about themselves
onto the object of their anger. Progressives are full of self-loathing,
among other things. George Galloway is a windbag and grifter, the very
definition of a popinjay. In the bum fight I witnessed, the two
combatants were both mediocre minds pretending they were something
better.

Anyway, the phrase “pseudo-intellectual poseur” always comes to mind
when I think of *Vox*. There’s a humorless scold quality salted with a
genteel prissiness one used to associate with upper class homosexuals.
Mostly, it is mediocre minds prancing around as intellectuals when they
would be better off teaching English at a public middle-school.

This is a great example
from <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/4/12/8387003/i-am-an-immigrant"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Matt “Don’t Call Me Julio” Yglesias</a>.

*Studies done in the United States show that immigration [raises average
incomes of native-born
Americans](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/04/22/immigration_raises_american_income.html),
including [native-born Americans with low skill
levels](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/04/18/strange_moral_calculus_of_low_skilled_immigration.html).
Immigration is, of course, <a
href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/01/high_tech_immigrant_productivity_indian_computer_programmers_earn_a_huge.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">even better for the incomes of the
immigrants themselves</a>, which makes reduced barriers to migration one
of the <a
href="http://www.cgdev.org/publication/economics-and-emigration-trillion-dollar-bills-sidewalk-working-paper-264"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">biggest possible game changers</a> for
overall global growth. What’s more, as the
Economist’s <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2015/04/puzzles"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ryan Avent has recently shown</a>, more
immigration could be a highly effective fix to
the <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/10/28/7078167/secular-stagnation"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">currently hot topic of secular
stagnation</a>.*

Now, put aside the fact that we could fill out those same posters with
pictures of Pakistani pimps and their teenage victims. Yglesias is
claiming that the laws of supply and demand do not apply to labor
markets. After all, if increasing the amount of low-skilled labor
increases the *wages* of low-skilled labor, we have stumbled upon a
truth that invalidates the foundations of economics. Everything we know
about economics is therefore wrong.

Of course, that’s not the case and Yglesias is a stupid person for
saying it. His frequent use of the phrase “game changer” is one of those
easy to spot signs that the person using it is not very bright. Stupid
people love talking about game changers. At the root of it is the
magical belief that utopia is just around the next bend. But, they think
it sounds clever so they decorate their language with it as well as
other abracadabra phases.
