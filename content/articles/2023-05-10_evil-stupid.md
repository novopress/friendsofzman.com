Congressman Thomas Massie (R-Agribusiness) is waging jihad against his
fellow Republicans in the House over H.R. 2, an immigration bill that
has been working through the House since January. He has specifically
targeted the E-Verify provision, that would require employers to use the
system, which has been in place for decades, to verify that their
employees are legally allowed to work in the country. He has been on
Twitter
[railing](https://twitter.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1655219404009873409)
against the E-Verify system.

There are two schools of thought as to why Massie has picked out this
provision of the bill as his reason for opposing it. One is the old
“Republicans donors like cheap labor” argument, which is mostly true.
Massie gets a lot of money from agribusiness, which relies on illegal
aliens to work in meat packing plants, commercial farming enterprises
and food processing facilities. What you never find in a food processing
plant these days is anyone speaking English.

The other explanation for Massie’s berserk opposition to this provision
is that he is a libertarian who spasmodically opposes government
programs. He has been dressing up his arguments in libertarian
jibber-jabber. He claims that Joe Biden will use the system to prevent
normal Americans from working. According to Massie, this program will
require you to get permission from Joe Biden in order to work, which is
a weird claim, but consistent with libertarianism.

In fairness, both explanations could be true. In order to get into the
House of Senate, you have to be willing to take bribes from the donor
class. The reason both parties support the current chaos is because both
parties have the same paymasters. Those paymasters think borders are bad
for business, so they oppose anything that would result in an orderly
border policy. Hiring libertarian goofballs to be the messenger on this
makes it look principled, rather than cynical.

The donor class will get serious about immigration when they start
feeling the pain of immigration in their own lives. This is what
happened a century ago. When newly imported anarchist and communist
started killing rich people, rich people suddenly got religion on
immigration. In short order Congress passed bills effectively ending
immigration for over half a century. We will see the same thing once a
rich person is murdered by Mexican cartel members.

There is another reason for Massie’s behavior. He may be a sociopath.
His claims about E-Verify are obvious lies, yet he tells them with
enthusiasm. The system has been in place for decades, but it has been
voluntary. In theory, employers are prohibited from hiring illegal
aliens, but they ignore the law. The point of making E-Verify mandatory
is to force employers to comply with existing law. Massie’s claims about
it being a new government program are an absurd lie.

Putting that aside, what we are seeing here is an example of how the
Republican Party is an ongoing fraud on its voters. It exists only as a
relief valve. You get mad at the Democratic administration and vote
Republican. They promise to do something about the latest thing, but
then they always find a “principled reason” for not doing something
about the latest thing. You see all of their favorite tricks in this
latest immigration bill that Biden has already promised to veto.

The first trick is what Massie is doing. He claims to oppose open
borders in theory, but he can never find a proposal he likes. Either the
proposed solution violates his libertarian principles or, as he argues
in this case, the proposed solution is not perfect, so not good enough
for him. If you read his Twitter, you will see that he is playing both
of these tricks on his voters right now. He says E-Verify will not work
and it is a violation of his principled stand against the government.

Of course, the only reason the House is pushing this bill along is the
Republicans know it has no chance of becoming law. When they had the
House, the Senate, and Trump in the White House, they could not be
bothered. Trump was sitting there with his pen ready to sign an
immigration bill, but there were always more important things to do like
moving commas around the tax code. Republicans only get serious on
immigration when they have no chance of passing legislation.

The worst part of this fraud is that people like Thomas Massie
deliberately use the virtues of their voters against them. In this case,
he is waving the bloody flag of Covid around to scare his voters. “See
what they did with Covid now imagine what they will do with this
program!” Meanwhile, over three million illegals have entered the
country since the start of the year. Millions more are queued up.
America is facing an
[invasion](https://twitter.com/BillFOXLA/status/1656284776691556354) and
the Republicans are aiding and abetting it.

Stanton Evans famously quipped “We have two parties here, and only two.
One is the evil party, and the other is the stupid party.” Ever since it
has been assumed that the Democrats are the evil party and the
Republicans the stupid party. The truth is the parties are neither of
those things. It is the voters. People who vote for Democrats are evil,
while the people who continue to vote Republican are stupid. Only when
enough people smarten up will be able to address the evil.
