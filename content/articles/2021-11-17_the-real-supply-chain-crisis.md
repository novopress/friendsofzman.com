**Note:** Behind the green door is a
<a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/posts/467868" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">long post</a> on the Star Trek franchise. I have been
watching these off and on for a couple of years and have some thoughts
on how the series evolved foreshadowing today’s events.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A popular plot in science fiction shows is that the human stars of the
show discover technology from an ancient race. In trying to figure out
how it works, they set off a reaction that puts them at risk. They
realize they have to figure out the ancient alien technology in order to
save the day. Usually, the moral of the story is that humans are infants
in the universe. They may have conquered interstellar travel, but they
are nowhere near ready to handle the complex stuff.

It is a popular storyline in science fiction shows because it allows the
writers to cook up exotic technology without thinking about how it
works. The technology can operate like magic to make the plot happen. It
also lets the writers do some finger wagging at the enemies of
Hollywood. The white cast members are humbled to learn that they are not
at the top of the humanoid hierarchy. Mostly it is just an easy way to
grind out a script for a television series like the Stargate franchise.

This concept is not without some parallels in this world. There were
people in the early Middle Ages confronted with the same issue. They
inherited things like aqueducts from the Romans but lacked the social
capital to keep them going. The ancient Greeks assumed the Mycenean
ruins were built by a race of giants. They could look at the ruins and
imagine what they were at their peak, but they had no idea how they were
built or who had built them. It was beyond their knowledge.

America may be entering a similar period. One of the growing complaints
in the dreaded private sector is the lack of talent. The mass media
notices the labor shortage in things like retail and hospitality, but
the real scarcity is upstream. Finding people with the cognitive ability
and work ethic to fill important roles is not easy. Often the choice is
one or the other. The person has the talent but is unreliable or they
are reliable but maybe a click below what the position demands.

The main driver is demographics. The Baby Boomer swan song is upon us,
and it is showing up in the payroll registers of American companies. The
first wave Boomers are in the prime retirement range. Covid has led many
to clock out early. The second wave is in their early sixties, so they
are planning to wrap things up. Generation-X is a much smaller cohort,
and the Millennials are not ready for prime time. The talent – work
ethic dichotomy is very obvious with Millennials.

Of course, it is with Millennials where the glories of
[diversity](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2016/06/28/diversity-defines-the-millennial-generation/)
appear. They are the second least white generation. The Zoomers are
mostly nonwhite. That talent – work ethic dichotomy is exacerbated by
“the tax”. The cost, in terms of human capital, in hiring the younger
generation is much higher, which means the talent for other things is
decreased even further. Basically the private sector is facing a smart
fraction problem that promises to get [much
worse](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/26/due-to-covid-college-enrollment-saw-largest-two-year-drop-in-50-years.html)
in the near future.

This talent shortage is showing up in strange places. College football
coaches are not considered super-smart guys, but it is a challenging
job. They run what amounts to a mid-sized business with hundreds of
employees. They also have to master the complexity of a game that has
reached its peak in complexity. Here is an
[example](http://www.playbookexchange.net/playbooks/Offense/01100301-FlyOffense.pdf)
of one part of a college football playbook. Finding men with the
required skillset to run a college football program is becoming
[increasingly
difficult](https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/with-a-lacking-supply-of-top-coaching-candidates-floridas-hesitancy-to-part-with-dan-mullen-crystalizes/).

The solution in sports like football is to simplify things. This is the
new trend in the game to reflect the demographic reality. Instead of
complex passing plays the offense just gives the ball to a fast guy and
lets him run around with it. One of the top young quarterbacks in the
NFL is Lamar Jackson. He scored a 13 on the Wonderlic test, which is
what you would expect from a janitor. Lamar is not working a Rubik’s
cube in his off hours nor is he studying a complex offensive system.

The dreaded private sector is going the same way. Automation is the way
to reduce the need for talent. Using robots is one way to do this in
manufacturing. Another way is software systems to atomize and control
the required tasks. In the office, software is doing more of the
analysis and decision making. Dispatchers, for example, are being
replaced by software that routes field personnel. Those people in the
field have mobile devices that fill in the blanks of their knowledge.

Part of what is driving the ruling class is the belief that technology
can replace those retiring white Baby Boomers. The dream of the
multicultural paradise, free of white power structures, assumes the
robots will take over from the white people. No one thinks much about
who is going to code, operate and maintain the AI. That is the fatal
flaw in the plan. There will never be a time when the machines become
self-sufficient and anything but
[super-racist](https://futurism.com/delphi-ai-ethics-racist).

The fact is, there is no escaping the ramifications of the cognitive
decline. We have created a society that requires an average IQ of about
97. The distribution of smarts provided sufficient talent at each layer
of society. The smart fraction was large enough to carry the rest. Now
that IQ has dipped below that threshold, we are starting to see problems
like the supply chain issues. This is just the beginning of a systemic
collapse brought on by the lack of social capital.

That is the real supply chain crisis. Each generation is supposed to
build on the next but starting in the middle of the last century this
system started to break. The Baby Boomers did not create enough
replacements. Worse yet, they did not train them to take up their
positions. The waves of immigration have watered down the system
further, creating shortages that will only get worse. Soon, Americans
will be like those humans in the sci-fi shows, unable to operate ancient
technology.
