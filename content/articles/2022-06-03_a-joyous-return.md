Distraction is a primary tool of politics, used most often by
politicians who are in trouble with their voters for some reason. Boris
Johnson is in trouble for partying like a rock star during the Covid
lockdowns, so he never shuts up about Ukraine. This has the added
benefit of providing an excuse for inflation, shortage and energy costs.
If he can get everyone to pretend that Ukraine is more important than
feeding their kids or paying their light bill, maybe they forget about
the partying too.

Joe Biden is trying the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aMRsLCfsu4&amp;t=254s"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">same act</a> with guns. Unlike Boris
Johnson, Biden has many more problems to hide via distraction. Eighteen
months into his tenure and just about everything has gone wrong. Biden
is about as popular as rectal cancer. The reason is incompetnace. This
is compounded by the fact that Biden is a vegetable, barely able to
function most of the time. Even when lucid, he reminds people why no
serious person ever thought Biden was anything but a clown.

His handlers are hoping they can have him stand over the corpses of dead
children, pointing the finger at white people and his troubles will go
away. This is what passes for clever politics in a world disconnected
from reality. Everyone is onto this stunt and no one is fooled by it.
Instead, people rush off to the gun shop and pick up something, just in
case this time things are different. Gun grabbers have sold more guns
and gun company stocks than John Browning.

The gun issue is particularly bad for Biden because it reminds people of
his reputation for being an outlandish liar. Most people know the facts
on guns. When the gun grabbers start in on their nonsense about
“military-style rifles”, “weapons of war” and “gun show loopholes”,
everyone knows they are lying. For Biden, it brings to mind all of his
other whoppers. Instead of distracting from the administration’s
problems, the gun issue refocuses the mind on the source of the
problems.

It will be interesting to see what the summer brings. The administration
seems to be poleaxed by the economic troubles. They try to avoid
mentioning it. Ukraine was supposed to be the main topic, but that is
now joining gas prices, food shortages and inflation on the list of
forbidden topics. They will need something to distract people, so we
will just have to wait and see. Who knows? Maybe they produce something
inventive to keep people busy over the summer.
