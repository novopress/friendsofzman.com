The ham-handed way American diplomats go about their craft is usually
just a source of amusement, but it does have serious consequences. For
decades, American rulers have been content to beat the stuffing out of
third world nothings, rather than mixing it up with the big boys like
Russia and China. It’s been mostly a waste of men and money, that has
sapped the strength of the military. Otherwise, it has not caused that
much trouble for Americans or anyone else, other than the third world
target.

That may be changing with the reckless and stupid way the Obama
administration has handled Ukraine.

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The story</a> from a while
back is a good example of the amateurish way the American deep state
interfaces with the world. The Russians have very real interests in
Ukraine. They also have very strong emotions about the place. They are
not going to stand by as America peels away another layer of their
defense against creeping liberalism.

They certainly are not going to let their access to the Black Sea get
blocked by a bunch of yahoos from western Ukraine.
<a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20140227/DAC7P0LG0.html"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">That’s why they have moved to
take Crimea</a> and inched the world closer to a very dangerous
confrontation.This may be a game for the ruling class in the state
department and the administration, but it is serious business to the
Russians. They will not yield to bluster from armchair generals in the
American media or positioned at places in the State Department.

The Ukraine has a respectable military force. They have roughly 700 main
battle tanks at the ready and 60,000 ground forces. To put that in
perspective, the Russians have 360,000 military personnel spread over
the whole of their country. If the Russians seize Crimea, Ukraine may
feel they have no choice by to send in their tanks. Deliberately causing
an international crisis by meddling in Ukraine is deeply stupid. <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">That’s how Americans play the
great game</a>, which why we should not be playing it.

The Ukrainian nationalists in the streets have done one thing. That’s
made clear they can and will force the politicians to flee. If you are a
Ukrainian politician right now you understand that and will appeal to
the nationalists. It is pretty safe bet that the nationalists will not
be OK with the Russians seizing the Crimea. On the other hand, the usual
suspects have been stirring up trouble in Ukraine for a long time, so
who knows how the politicians will respond. That’s why we bets stay out
of it.
