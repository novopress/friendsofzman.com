<a href="http://heartiste.wordpress.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Chateau Heartiste</a> is generally credited with
popularizing the term “beta male” as a term of art to describe the
over-class definition of masculine. The site is a Mecca for
“<a href="http://heartiste.wordpress.com/category/game/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">game</a>” theory, which is
different than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">game theory</a>. In that
world, dividing the male population into betas and alphas is important,
so it makes sense. The guys reading that site may not want to be hairy
chested he-men, but they want to get laid and if that means being a
little butch in public they will do it. That view of masculinity is
under assault by the Left.

The war is taking an odd turn this week. <a
href="http://nationalreview.com/article/366896/age-intolerance-mark-steyn"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mark Steyn</a> takes on the
hilarious story of the Duck Dynasty guy getting axed for being a public
Christian. Steyn’s take is that it is a part of the stifling of
non-leftist speech. He’s certainly right that the Left wants to stamp
out religion, particularly Christianity. The list of things that are
unmentionable in public grows longer every day and most of Christianity
is now on the list.

The <a
href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/366912/steyn-speech-jason-lee-steorts"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hysterical reaction of
National Review’s homosexual conspiracy theorist</a>, Jason Lee Steorts,
shows there is another angle. The Duck Dynasty guys are emblematic of
the traditional American male. That’s the guy who shaves because he has
to, likes blowing things up and shooting guns. You see guys with big
beards and bandannas and you assume they are not to be trifled with,
unless you are a tough guy. Guys like Steorts hate these people because
their mere existence puts the lie to effete culture.

There must always be a balance in civilized society, between the sorts
of guys who settle things with their fists and the type who settle
things with words. It’s the tension between John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart
in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. You need both, but the West is now
desperately short of the John Wayne type and over flowing with the Jimmy
Stewart type. A world run by Jason Lee Steorts is a world ripe for
conquest or worse, a world ripe for conquest by women. That’s where we
are now.
