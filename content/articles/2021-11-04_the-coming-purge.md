One of the rules of the universe is that you should never take advice
from your enemy, unless you are a Republican. This is the one big
exception to what should be a fairly obvious rule of life. This also
applies to so-called conservatives, who love nothing more than taking
advice from the people they claim are their opponents. On the other
hand, so-called conservatives and Republicans never listen to their
voters. You see this in the aftermath of the Tuesday elections.

<a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/03/politics/trump-election-voters-2021-what-matters/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> we have an actor on a far left
cable channel explaining how Glenn Youngkin beat Terry McAuliffe in
Virginia. The cable channels always have these guys who pretend to know
things that they cannot possibly know. They are less reliable than palm
readers, but they are a staple of political coverage. In this case, the
role of this guy is to explain why the Republican should read the
election results as an embrace of the far-left agenda and use it as a
road map for future elections.

Right on cue, the <a
href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/11/virginia-shows-why-a-credible-conservative-needs-to-challenge-trump-in-2024/#slide-1"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">mouth breathers</a> at National Review
repeat everything the far-left is saying about the election results. You
see, the win by Youngkin is actually a rejection of Donald Trump and his
ideas. “The stakes simply will be too high for conservative Republicans
to defer and allow Trump to use the election as an extended ego trip to
air his grievances about 2020” reads the post. The only path forward,
according to the author, is to take Left’s advice.

This has been the pattern for generations now.  After the 1980 election,
the Left said Reagan needed to govern from the center. The so-called
conservatives agreed that it was a conservative principle to govern as
moderates. The same thing happened after the blowouts of 1984 and 1988.
That’s when the conservative started with the “big tent” nonsense, which
was the excuse to not do anything that might upset the people who lost
three straight elections.

In fairness, the so-called conservatives know their audience. After the
McAuliffe conceded to Youngkin, the GrillerCons were out in their
backyards thinking happy thoughts about sports and grilling. They were
relieved by the results, because they could finally go back to grilling.
They “won” which for them means it is all over and they can get ready to
consume more product. Republicans and conservative know this type and
they know how to keep them content.

On the other hand, the Democrats does not take defeat lying down. It
took them three humiliating defeats back in the 1980’s before they
dropped the whole technocratic socialism stuff. Jimmy Carter, Walter
Mondale, and Mike Dukakis were their three party leaders in that span.
After each failure they responded with a promise to double down on their
agenda. It was only after the party leaders dropped dead and were
replaced by Boomers that they finally changed gears.

After Tuesday’s results, which were a stunning rejection of the Left’s
core agenda item, the war on white people, the Democrats promised to
double down.
[Here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/11/03/democrats-virginia-biden-spending-infrastructure/)
we have Nancy Pelosi promising to speed up their plans in the House. The
people animating Biden’s corpse have him
[saying](https://www.axios.com/biden-spending-bills-election-blow-3af98be3-49e0-4eec-bd5a-81f1fb41777c.html)
the same thing. [Here](https://archive.md/vBjkt) we have the far-left
members saying that the election proves they must pass their agenda. The
clear message, as far they are concerned, is they need to do more.

A normal person might be tempted to think this is proof that these
people are crazy but this actually sound policy. The one thing the
Democrats know is that their voters never want to hear the word
“compromise” unless it is used to bash the enemy. What the core Democrat
voter wants to hear is the promise to destroy the other side. They
certainly have no interest in reading about their guys asking the other
side for advice on picking their leaders in the next election.

Now, to be fair, elections are just ceremonial beauty pageants that have
very little to do with policy or ideology. The voters of Virginia
support Democrats because most of them are managerial-class types
dependent on government. Most are not even from the state and about a
quarter are not from the country. The reason many stayed home this time
is they are tired of Covid theater and the nonsense with the schools. In
other words, the election had nothing to do with policy.

This is why the inner party never wavers and why the flunkies of the
outer party always beg for forgiveness when they accidentally win. Both
sides know that these election shows are just a relief valve. The
so-called conservatives know that they will be writing the
“conservatives case for” whatever the Left cooks up next and the Left
knows they will keep plugging along on their schemes. Once you accept
that
[elections](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B)
don’t matter, it all makes a lot more sense.

That is the central lesson of Tuesday. Caring about which side wins has
no more impact on the results than caring about the winner of a sports
game. The dialectic of formal politics is about normalizing what is not
normal or even conceived. One side proposes and the other side opposes.
The synthesis of these two forces is always what both sides had in mind
from the start. The point is to condition the mind of the people to
accept whatever they have planned.

That plan is the restoration of the old order prior to the unfortunate
disruptions of the last five years. The great purge of populist politics
is well under way. The Democrats are marginalizing and isolating their
Bernie Sanders wing. The Republicans are about to purge their Donald
Trump wing. This election and the midterms next year are the process for
conditioning the voters on both sides to embrace it. If history is any
guide, the bulk of the voters will be happy to obey.
