The January 6 committee has finally wrapped up its work with a series of
criminal referrals for Donald Trump. Exactly no one is surprised by this
result, as this was obviously the point of the charade from the start.
The only people surprised by the ending are the <a
href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/12/january-6-committee-criminal-referral-donald-trump/672514/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">cranks</a> and <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/12/19/jan-6-committee-report-trump-referrals/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">crazies</a> that still bang on about
Trump. The one interesting thing about this is that it highlights the
defining feature of the people who compose the core of the anti-Trump
cult.

There are two big questions with this latest development. The first is
whether the Department of Justice will go ahead and indict Trump.
Merrick Garland has been under intense pressure from the crazies to
throw Trump in jail, but he has so far found a way to avoid deciding. He
just appointed one of their favorite goofballs to operate as a special
prosecutor. It was a delaying tactic, much in the way that the
appointment of John Durham was a way to run out the clock.

Garland is a bloodthirsty fanatic like the rest of his cult, but he
understands the danger of bearing his fangs in public. If he makes it
too obvious that his cult no longer has any respect for the people or
institutions of the country, there could be trouble. These people
believe deeply in the power of narrative, so the narrative builders are
busy inventing new stories to provide the content creators in the media.
These things take time, so the final call is probably months away.

The other big question is whether this is good for us. There are a few
schools of thought on the whole throw Trump in jail business. The
conventional school is that even though everyone knows this is Stalinist
nonsense, it is another blow to his brand, which is dying from a
thousand cuts right now. The cumulative effect of these assaults is
slowly marginalizing Trump. At some point, Trump will have to agree to
go out with a whimper and thus leave his supporters without a leader.

That seems to be the thinking of the anti-Trump cultists. They think
they are the white hats with the support of the public. The counter is
that Trump is once again blessed with the best enemies. Just when people
get tired of his act, his opponents remind the world that Trump stirs
the passions of the most loathsome, vulgar people at the center of the
current crisis. No man has been blessed with the volume of free media as
Trump and this is just more free attention.

There are other scenarios for how this plays out. Garland could formerly
charge Trump and then the Republicans mount a “totally spontaneous and
authentic” campaign to remove him from primary ballots. In the same way
they engineered Congressman Steve King’s exit from politics, they would
run the same scam on Trump. By coordinating with the other party, they
would pretend they are simply protecting the party from this obviously
bad man.

From a dissident perspective, this would be manna from heaven. No one
would be fooled by this and it would bolster the case for boycotting the
party. The only thing keeping many people engaged with Republican
politics is the hope that the highly corrupt leadership could one day be
replaced. Trump is their symbol of hope, so his engineered removal by
party leaders would be the final straw. Millions of Trump voters would
suddenly start thinking about boycotting the system.

Even if the Republican party sits this out, Trump getting hauled away in
chains is good news for dissidents. Given what has been revealed about
the FBI’s involvement in censuring speech on-line and the DOJ running a
<a
href="https://justthenews.com/accountability/russia-and-ukraine-scandals/doj-spied-house-intelligence-committee-investigators"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">domestic spying operation</a> on
Congress, it is hard to not see the bananas in this republic. Biden
having his political rival thrown in prison on manufactured charges
would instantly vaporize support for the system as a whole.

George Washington famously said that the last act of any government is
to loot the treasury, but he turns out to have been wrong. In
pre-ideological societies, this was probably a fair observation. Like
the rest of the Founders, Washington was deeply influenced by the
English Civil War. He had ancestors who fought on the side of the king,
so it was more than just historical. In the age before ideology, money
was what eventually broke the legitimacy of government.

In the ideological age, the final acts of the government are about
snuffing out the last flames of love the people have for the cause. The
Soviets eventually made even the most loyal communists cynical. Mao had
to murder a lot of people, but eventually the ChiComs lost faith in
communism. Of course, the final acts of revolutionary France were to
bring the Jacobins to meet Madame Guillotine. As with marriage, when the
love for the cause fades, the relationship soon dies.

That is the way to look at this Trump business and all the other stuff
that has been revealed over the last decade. The loathsome degenerates
parading across the political stage rely on public faith in the system.
Every outrage undermines that faith until a tipping point is reached.
Maybe it is Trump being thrown in a dungeon or maybe it is something
else, but the tipping point is always closer than we think. Godspeed
anti-Trumpers, Godspeed.
