The title of this bit is from
<a href="http://isteve.blogspot.com/2013/11/what-changed-on-112263.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stever Sailer</a>. Unsurprisingly, he
recognized long ago that the JFK narrative was just another instance of
white on white crime. That is, northern whites (whites who identify with
northern attitudes on race) against southern whites. The mythology is
that northern whites are tolerant and open minded, while southern whites
are uneducated bigots.

That means you can be southern white while growing up in New Hampshire,
as long as you say bad things about non-whites and shop at WalMart. On
the other hand, many whites in suburban Atlanta are preachy about race,
loath southern culture and therefore qualify as northern white. It’s
good white versus bad white. The JFK killing shows the divide quite
clearly as we see in <a

*FOR 50 years, Dallas has done its best to avoid coming to terms with
the one event that made it famous: the assassination of John F. Kennedy
on Nov. 22, 1963. That’s because, for the self-styled “Big D,” grappling
with the assassination means reckoning with its own legacy as the “city
of hate,” the city that willed the death of the president.*

*It will miss yet another opportunity this year. On Nov. 22 the city,
anticipating an international spotlight, will host an official
commemoration ceremony. Dallas being Dallas, it will be quite the show:
a jet flyover, a performance from the Naval Academy Men’s Glee Club and
remarks from the historian David McCullough on Kennedy’s legacy.*

*But once again, spectacle is likely to trump substance: not one word
will be said at this event about what exactly the city was in 1963, when
the president arrived in what he called, just moments before his death,
“nut country.”*

In other words, bad whites killed the hero of good whites and they
refuse to accept blame for it. Never mind that Kennedy hated black
people and seemed to admire Hitler. His old man was a Nazi so the apple
does not fall far from the tree. The fact is JFK was killed by a
quintessentially good white named Lee Harvey Oswald. He was a communist
who tried to defect to Russia. Oswald would have fit in with Bernadine
Dorn.

Then we have the fact that a bad white pushed through Civil Rights and
was quite fond of black people, going back to the 1930’s. Johnson was a
lot like Woodrow Wilson, in that he went against his inclinations and
his native culture in order to fit it, but he was never accepted by the
good whites. These inconvenient facts are airbrushed out of the
narrative, as it inconsistent with the mythology of the good whites.

There’s another way to distinguish the tribal differences. LBJ was
perfectly at home rubbing elbows with blacks. He got his start in
politics by helping blacks get to the polls and actually voting.
Granted, they were voting for him, but it shows his natural affinity for
black people. Kennedy, on the other hand, despised blacks and made sure
he was never around them. He thought MLK was a threat to the nation.

But, the truth is never important in mythology.
