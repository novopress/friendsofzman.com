While doing homework on the Army – McCarthy hearings, I was reminded of
two things that seem to come up regularly. One is that the people
causing the mayhem in our society are lacking in self-awareness. The
term McCarthyism has dropped out of use of late, I cover this in the
show, but most people are old enough to remember when it was popular and
what it meant. The new McCarthyites are totally unaware of that rather
easy comparison between themselves and McCarthy.

The other thing that comes up repeatedly is that the people causing
trouble have a weird blind spot about the internet. Often, they will
make a big bold moral statement and then sometime later make another big
bold moral statement that is the exact opposite of the previous
statement. Even crazier is they will do this on Twitter. Not long after,
people will post screen caps of their prior statement alongside the new
statement, easily revealing the contradiction.

You are left with the impression that these people are unaware of the
internet, despite using it for their political drama. You really see
this with the January 6 show trials they are cooking up. The claims they
are making against these people are for things these people have done in
the recent past. Adam Schiff spent four years claiming the 2016 election
was illegitimate. Now he is tormenting people for the crime of
questioning the legitimacy of the 2020 election.

What lies at the heart of this is the problem presented by McCarthy. The
sorts of people attracted to these moral crusades are without the normal
sense of self that mentally healthy people possess. They need a foil,
someone they can point to as bad in some way, so they can claim to be
good by virtue of opposing that person. It is why their politics are
highly personal. Liz Cheney cannot stop obsessing over Trump because she
is a moral nullity who needs a villain to feel like a hero.

That is what makes the January 6 commission worth following. These
people are so morally obtuse they could very well set themselves up like
McCarthy. None of the people on that commission are sympathetic to the
public. None of them seem to be smart enough to see this. They are so
sure they are on the sign of angels, because they are certain their
opponents are evil. That is how these people eventually find themselves
on the other end of the inquisition.
