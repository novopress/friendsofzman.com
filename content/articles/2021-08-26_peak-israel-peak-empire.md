There is an old expression about the Bolshevik revolution that says it
was made by Jewish brains, Latvian bayonets, and Russian stupidity.
There is a lot of truth to it, as the ethnic makeup of the revolution
was not very Russian. One way to look at the revolution is as a revolt
of subject people against their old masters. This was made possible by
the cupidity and stupidity of the Russian elites. A very similar thing
is happening in the American empire, just at a slower pace.

This formulation can also apply to the Middle East. For a long time now,
the history of the region has been shaped by a combination of Israeli
strategy, Saudi Arabian oil, and American force. It is reasonable to say
that America would have no presence in the region if not for Israel. The
creation of the Jewish state in 1948 set the region on fire, drawing in
the Americans and Russian. Oil and gas, of course, is what made the
region vital in the long battle between the two empires.

Since the Cold War ended, the primary reason for US involvement has been
Israeli intrigue and Saudi oil production. The first crusade in Iraq was
about protecting the oil and gas interests. The second crusade was about
changing the balance of power in the region to meet Israel security
needs. The crusade in Afghanistan was mostly about containing Iran,
despite the rhetoric. Look at a map and it is easy to see that it would
be a useful launching pad for air strikes against the Iranians.

The collapse of Afghanistan is getting a lot attention, but it is part
of a larger collapse of the regional order. Israel, for example, has
undergone a political revolution of sorts with the end of the Netanyahu
regime. The new prime minister is the product of the neo-liberal order,
rather than the fight for independence. He got rich selling software in
America and his parents were left-wing fanatics from San Francisco. He
is a man of the global managerial class rather than the local elite.

On the Saudi side of things, the walls continue to close in as their
stranglehold on the oil and gas market collapses. New technology has
opened up vast reserves in North America, so the need for Saudi oil has
declined. Iran’s [Caspian
Sea](https://www.zerohedge.com/energy/irans-huge-caspian-gas-find-geopolitical-gamechanger)
natural gas deposit will put her on even footing with the Saudis. That
leg of the triumvirate driving regional politics is no longer the
gatekeeper of the world’s energy supply. Soon, they will be just another
gas station selling a commodity on the world market.

Taken together, the old combination of Israeli strategy, Saudi Arabian
oil and American force is about to unravel. America still has troops
staged in Syria and Iraq, but the writing is on the wall there too. It
also means Israel as the primary mover and shaker in the region is
coming to an end. Without American firepower and the Saudi control of
energy politics, Israeli is just another country in the region. Throw in
the Russian-Iranian partnership and the Middle East is going to look
very different.

This is one reason the neoconservatives have been trying to restart the
Cold War with the Russians. Given the their involvement in the Middle
East, a new contest with them would draw America back into the region.
It was also why Israel talked Trump into dumping the Iran deal.
Normalization of relations between Europe and Iran makes war with Iran
impossible. If that is not an option, then there is little point in
America maintaining a military presence in the region.

What we may be seeing is peak Israel. For generations, Israel has
occupied the center of American politics. During the Cold War, the three
“I’s” of politics were Israel, Indiana, and Ireland. After the Cold War
it was Israel, India, and Investment Banking. It is fair to say that
what passes for conservatism in America is just low-tax Zionism. The
collapse of American involvement in the region means there is little
reason to make Israel the focal point of American politics.

This is no small thing. The Republicans are celebrating the bad fortune
of Biden and the Democrats over Afghanistan, but this is very bad for
them. During the Cold War, the left-side of the American ruling elite
was allowed a free hand in domestic affairs and the right-side ran
foreign affairs. The end of the Soviet empire left the right-side
without a reason to exist, so we got the crusades against Islam for the
last 30 years. Suddenly, the only reason to vote Republican has gone
away.

It is not all roses for the left-side either. Without the distraction of
endless war, the focus will be on domestic issues. All of those people
who were titillated by the prospect of “glassing” various countries can
now focus their energy on the people trying to turn their sons into
girls. America has been at war with someone for close to a century now
and this has allowed the Left to remake the country. It also allowed
them to underwrite their schemes with the proceeds of empire.

For seventy years, Israel has played an enormous role in the politics of
the American empire, but that seems to be coming to an end. It may be
that Trump’s decision to move the embassy to Jerusalem was the top of
Israeli influence. The fading of the American empire, particularly in
the Middle East, means the influence of Israel on the world must fade
with it. It also means the Israelis will have to seek new partners in
their endless game of neighborhood politics. America is no longer
useful.
