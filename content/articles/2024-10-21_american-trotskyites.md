One of the most remarkable, but woefully unremarked, developments of the
last decade is the shift of the neocons back to the left. Starting with
Trump coming down the escalator in 2015, the neocons first tried to
purge him and his supporters like they did to Pat Buchanan and the
paleos in the 1990’s. When that failed, they began their slow march out
of the conservative movement then out of the Republican Party, returning
to their old home on what we call the left.

Perhaps it is the timescale, but this is not something that has gotten a
lot of attention, despite the centrality of the neocons to conservatism.
There are prominent neocons at all the major media nodes, where they
have spent the last decade railing about Donald Trump on a daily basis.
For those familiar with the history of neoconservatism and their wars
with the people we call paleos, this transition is like getting
confirmation of a long-dismissed conspiracy theory.

Imagine if twenty years from now a collection of retired government
officials steps forward and to say that 9/11 was an inside job. The
planes were real, but the whole thing was orchestrated by the CIA or
maybe the Mossad. It is not just that it would reveal a conspiracy to
conceal the truth, but that it would validate the people tarred as
conspiracy theories for doubting the official truth. It would be the
sort of revelation that leads to questioning other official truths.

That is how this <a
href="https://jewishinsider.com/2024/10/former-bush-aides-make-a-conservative-jewish-case-for-kamala-harris/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> about Bill Kristol and Eliot
Cohen should be viewed. Way back when a group of Jewish intellectuals
broke with the left in the middle of the last century and started their
march into Buckley conservatism, there was a debate about what they were
really doing. Was it a way to subvert the Buckley movement? Were these
people genuinely changing their ideological orientation or were they
simply opportunists seeing conservatism as a more useful vehicle for
their project?

Long forgotten is the fact that the label “neoconservative” was a smear
coined by a socialist named Michael Harrington. These newly minted
conservatives were often called Trotskyites because they never abandoned
their old ideology, but simply opposed the people who came to dominate
the American left. Of course, others accused them of being a stalking
horse for Zionism and the Israel lobby. Still others suspected that
their obsession with Russia was the real motivation.

In other words, from the very start no one trusted their sincerity with
regards to their conversion to the conservative cause. They brought lots
of money and organizational might, so the Buckley crowd overlooked these
concerns and welcomed them into the movement over many objections.
Before long, the neocons organized the purge of their doubters and
enemies in the movement. Half a century or so since this started, the
skeptics of these people have been vindicated.

Buried in that post about Kristol and Cohen is an easily overlooked
assertion that has always been at the heart of the issue. They claim
that conservative Jews have specific interests that they think are
better served by the Democrats now. Leaving aside their definition of
“conservative Jews”, what they are arguing is that this subgroup of
Americans has interests peculiar to themselves that can conflict with
the majority interests of the country, but those minority interests come
first.

This gets to something further down the memory hole than the old neocon
– paleocon battles of the last century. Jewish liberals and leftists
have often accused neocons and Zionists of being bad for the Jews,
because they confirm the claims often made by Jewish opponents regarding
the loyalty of Jews. Bill Kristol makes explicit that his primary
interests lie outside of and often in opposition to the interest of the
American people, so you can see the problem.

A lot of people accused of being conspiracy theorists with regards to
the behavior of the neocons have been vindicated over the last decade.
This gets little to no attention in the mainstream media because the
neocons still wield enormous power. They have always deftly folded their
interests into those of the Israel lobby and no one in politics dares
take on those guys. For elected officials, opposing Israel means losing
the next election and for the chattering classes, it means exile.

Another aspect of this is the ease with which the neocons have made the
transition from conservative and Republican to progressive and Democrat.
Disgraced in the Bush years, they nevertheless hung on in the Obama
years, orchestrating various schemes like the 2014 coup in Ukraine. They
have had total control of the Biden administration to the point where
its sole purpose was war with Russia. At no point in this transition was
there a hint of dissent or self-examination.

The other side of this is the fact that the Democratic Party has put up
no resistance to the return of their old Trotskyites comrades. The same
people who were marching around in the streets, banging their pots and
pans over the Bush wars in the Middle East now wear Ukraine lapel pins.
Without a trace of irony, they accuse Trump fans of disloyalty for not
supporting the Ukraine war or the Israel wars. There is a last scenes in
Animal Farm quality to all of it.

Of course, this raises the oldest critique of America’s two-party
political system, that it is just a show put on for the masses. The real
decisions are made outside of public view by the powerful interests who
control the system. One of those powerful groups are the neocons, who
work with the Israel lobby to control foreign policy. Given what we have
witnessed over the last decade, that old critique is vindicated. The
people in charge are immune the ballot box and operate as an alien
overclass.
