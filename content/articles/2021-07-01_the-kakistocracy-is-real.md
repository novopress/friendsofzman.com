An easily ignored aspect of the Tucker Carlson spying story is just how
ham-fisted this caper was executed, regardless of the reason. Carlson is
a relentless critic of the regime, but his audience is relative tiny.
His average total audience is roughly 3 million people per night. Even
if every night is a new crowd, that is an audience of 15 million in a
country of 330 million people. He may be the biggest name in cable news,
but the reality is, cable news is a low impact medium.

This was always the lesson of the Trump phenomenon. The entirety of the
mass media, including the so-called conservatives, aligned against Trump
but he was able to win the nomination and the general election. These
are people who were sure they were the king makers in national politics.
This TV carny comes along and walks right through their lines as if they
were not there. Then he turned them into objects of ridicule and mockery
by calling them childish names.

If the intelligence agencies were what they imagine themselves to be,
they would see that Tucker is never going to be much of a problem. They
could just ignore him, like most everyone does, or they could use him.
Carlson is one of the few serious people on television, but he is still
on TV. He wants ratings, so a shrewd intel operative could feed him some
juicy tidbits that serve the interests of the regime. Instead, they are
in a petty spat and making him the sympathetic victim.

These sorts of thumbless capers raise an important issue. Our managerial
elite is rapidly getting dumber. This is plainly obvious in the military
side. Sure, rural peasants armed with Russian surplus were able to
defeat the US army in the 1960’s, but that theater negated the primary
American advantage at the time. Armor and advanced transport are useless
in a jungle. Air dominance is not terribly effective against guerilla
tactics in urban and jungle conditions.

In Afghanistan and Iraq, the US military could exploit every
technological advantage against a poorly equipped and trained opponent.
In Afghanistan, the US faced off against a Bronze Age opponent. After
two decades the white flag has gone up and the Taliban will take over
this autumn. In Iraq, a ragtag force of insurgents led by a cleric came
close to defeating the US army. The final peace looked more like a
concession by the US, as Iraq is now an Iranian client.

The gross incompetency of the military is not unique. The entire
managerial class is suffering from a rapid decline in intelligence. The
truth is the system evolved for an adult population of the last century.
It reflected the demographics of the population as a whole, but also the
demographics of the ruling class. Over the last couple of generations,
the people taking up positions in the system are significantly dumber,
reflecting the changing demographics of the country.

This IQ decline will only become more acute in the next decade. The
great Baby Boomer retirement will hit the civil service harder than the
dreaded private sector, because the civil service is much older. The
average age of the private workforce is roughly 35, depending upon who
is doing the measuring. Similarly, the average age of the government
workforce is 50. The leadership class is even older. In other words, the
people running the system are geezers, not long for the world.

This is most stark in politics. Joe Biden is so old he has been in
office longer than most people have been alive. The leadership of both
parties is close behind. Pelosi, Schumer, McCarthy, Hoyer and McConnel
reflect the sensibilities and the mating decisions of the disappearing
past. Their replacements, Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Tim Scott, and so
on, reflect the rapidly approaching future. Repeat this throughout the
civil service and you can see the problem. The kakistocracy is real.

This decline in IQ is evident in the current upheaval. The great
Progressive awakening of the 1950’s and 1960’s was driven by idealism.
They really thought they were going to create a better world. It was
also driven by the big change in the ruling class. Jews had taken up
positions in the post-war ruling elite. They were making their mark by
leading many of the cultural revolutions, like civil rights.
Self-interest played a role, but social justice has always been a part
of the Jewish cultural outlook.

Today, the revolts we see look like a cargo cult. They are reenactors
playing parts they heard about in school. They think if they can replay
the events of the past, the past will come alive and the great do-over
begins. They are led by a carnival of simpletons and lunatics who mostly
like smashing things and making noise. Antifa and BLM are the short bus
passengers in the story of street activism. None of what we are seeing
makes any sense or has any point. It is just mayhem for the sake of it.

The institutions of a society are the tools of the people running the
society, designed for their use over the course of time. The
institutions of America were made for people a full standard deviation
smarter than today’s rulers. Those tools were also created with certain
cultural assumptions missing from the current class. The next generation
of rulers are the [opening scenes](https://youtu.be/ypEaGQb6dJk) of
*2001: A Space Odyssey* compared to the men who created the tools used
to run the empire.

It will not end well.
