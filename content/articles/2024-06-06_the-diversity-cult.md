The 2023 Irish action thriller, *In the Land of Saints and Sinners*, is
one of those films that offers some insight into the machinations of our
cultural overlords. It is one of those small budget adult dramas that
does not get a ton of attention but does well on the streaming services
after its initial release. It is not that these are bad films, but they
are not expected to pack the theaters. These are the new version of the
B-Movie that fill up the spaces between the heavily hyped, big budget
films.

Anyway, the film is set in Ireland during the Troubles because every
movie about Ireland is set during the Troubles. It stars Liam Neeson,
who plays Finbar Murphy, a hired assassin who lives in a quiet coastal
town. It is not all that clear who is assigning the hits, but they come
through a local businessman who gets the assignments and hands them out
to men like Finbar. This local businessman is not connected to the
Troubles and makes sure to not get involved in politics.

The story arc for Finbar starts during his final assignment when the guy
he is about to kill gives him some advice rather than beg for his life.
Finbar’s habit is to grab his target off the street and take him out to
the woods, where he makes the guy dig his own grave before shooting him
with a shotgun. He then plants a tree on the grave. This target is a
former contract killer, who urges Finbar to make something of the rest
of his life before he ends up in the same place as him.

This leads Finbar to have a crisis of conscience and he decides to
retire. Meanwhile, some IRA terrorists have come into town to hide out
after having set off a bomb in Belfast that killed some children. They
are staying with a relative who lives in the town and that relative just
happens to have a run in with Finbar. Of course, Finbar solves the
problem by taking the guy out to his favorite killing field. Thus, we
have the central conflict of the film as the terrorists face off against
Finbar.

This all sounds like the basis for a good old-fashioned thriller. You
get some Irish history as a backdrop, and you get to see Liam Neeson use
his “particular set of skills” to slowly take care of the bad guys.
Neeson has been playing this role since he got super famous for doing it
in the movie *Taken*. He is in his seventies now, but he still manages
to make it work, just as long as he does not have to move around too
much. In this film he is the wise old version of the lethal weapon.

Somewhere in the middle of the film, there is a black guy. Finbar is in
a pub and there is a black guy playing Irish tunes on a fiddle. He is
not a black leprechaun, but he is a short guy so that would have made
some sense. Instead, he is a refugee from Africa who somehow settled
into this tiny coastal town in rural Ireland. He tells Finbar that the
reason he picked the town is he wanted to escape the violence of his
home country and he once heard Irish music as a kid.

It gets more absurd. Later in the film there is the big show down
between Finbar and the terrorists at the pub. The terrorists are
shooting the place up and Finbar sees the sacred African hiding under a
table, so he rushes over to save him. In other words, the wandering
African is not just a ridiculous addition to a film set in 1970’s
Ireland, he is now a sacred symbol of the film. In that scene you expect
the people to scream, “leave the women and children but save our sacred
African!”

Clearly, the quality control committee realized that their film did not
have the required amount of diversity, so the script was sent back for a
rewrite. The writers probably thought they were okay because they made
the head terrorist a sassy girl boss with two thick headed male
henchmen. That was not enough so they needed to figure out a way to add
some color to story set in rural 1970’s Ireland and they settled on
having a peripatetic African midget playing the fiddle in the pub.

We have all become used to the black washing and race swapping that goes
on in the culture, but in a film like this you see how mechanical it has
become. Somewhere in the process there is a crew of shrews and scolds
who make sure there is a girls boss and the proper amount of color. They
do not care if it makes any sense. Like people with rubber stamps in a
bureaucracy, their job is to make sure the film has enough diversity
points before it goes into production.

Eric Hoffer famously said, “What starts out here as a mass movement ends
up as a racket, a cult, or a corporation.” In fact, it often becomes all
three and you see it with the diversity rackets that now infest every
institution. It is a lucrative racket for those who master the arcana,
but it has been embedded in the economy. Like the green rackets, the
diversity rackets are now part of the fabric of corporate life. It is
assumed to be an essential part of every large enterprise.

The thing that holds it in place, however, is that it is a cult. There
is little doubt that many of the people in that film thought it was
stunning and brave that they had a little African guy skittering around
the set. Those who thought it was a ridiculous addition to the film kept
their head down because they did not want the lunatics from the cult of
diversity hounding them over it. The result is we now have diversity
everywhere when what we need is to have it nowhere.
