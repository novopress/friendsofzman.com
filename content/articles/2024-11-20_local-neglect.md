This week, Erik Prince, the founder of the private military company
Blackwater,
<a href="https://x.com/realErikDPrince/status/1858553096638464478"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> a condemnation of the
Venezuelan ruler on Twitter. Prince has connections to the inner circle
of Donald Trump, so his opinions about such things could reflect Trump’s
opinion or may influence Trump’s opinion. He also linked to this New
York Times
<a href="https://archive.is/yGGzl" rel="noopener" target="_blank">puff
piece</a> on Venezuelan “opposition leader” María Corina Machado, which
paints her as the Margaret Thatcher of South America.

The quotes around the term “opposition leader” are because there is
nothing authentic about María Corina Machado. Like Juan Guaidó, who
preceded her as the official opposition leader, Machado is largely a
product of the American foreign policy machinery, which produces these
figures on demand. The United States intelligence community runs a
complex program to select, filter and groom opposition candidates for
just about every country on the globe.

That is not to say Machado is not a real Venezuelan, but that like most
of these American made opposition leaders, she is more comfortable in an
American faculty lounge than on the streets of Caracas. This was the
problem with Juan Guaidó, who is now driving an Uber in Miami. The
people who select and groom these people select and groom people who are
compelling to them, rather than the target audience, which is why they
tend not to do so well in their home country.

It speaks to the insularity of the American managerial elite, as well as
to the poverty of human intelligence. They never think about why Nicolás
Maduro remains popular, despite the conditions in the country. He may
not have majority support, it is impossible to know, but he has a strong
base of support. The same was true of Hugo Chavez, who preceded Maduro.
The American elites just see a thug and assume everyone sees the same
thing, so he must be illegitimate.

That is not to say Maduro is a good ruler. By objective measures, he is
a terrible ruler, outside of his ability to survive American regime
change efforts. Otherwise, his policies have been terrible, and they
have helped plunge his country into economic collapse, resulting in a
flood of people out of the country. It is a disgrace that the American
government has not been able to do anything to address this problem.
After all, this is the backyard of the American Empire.

Since President Monroe first articulated it in his State of the Union
address, it has been the official policy of the United States to protect
and safeguard the countries of the Western hemisphere. At first it was
intended to defend them against the colonial powers of the Old World. In
the 20th century, it evolved to include protecting the people of the New
World from their own rulers. Controlling guys like Maduro used to be a
primary mission of American foreign policy.

It is not as if America has not tried to regime change Venezuela. It
just so happens that Maduro is better at being gangster than the
gangsters in Washington. This gets to another problem with American
foreign policy. In the old days, when the people making policy traced
their family line to the Mayflower, dollar diplomacy and clever
statecraft were used to manage these problems. These days, the people
making policy can only think of using force to get their way.

That is where you see other problems turning up in South America. China
just
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg79y3rz1eo" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">opened</a> a massive new port in Peru, which will allow
it to service the South American market and buy lots of new friends in
the region. Chinese companies have acquired concessions for two of the
five ports adjacent to the Panama Canal. China is investing billions
into infrastructure projects in and around the canal. Of course, China
and Brazil are partners in BRICS and the Belt and Road Initiative.

While The Lobby demands the Levant get all the attention of the American
empire, the neocons demand Russia get all the attention and the China
hawks demand Taiwan get all the attention, the backyard of the American
Empire is ignored. This is in spite of the fact that the two major
problems facing the United States have their source south of the Rio
Grande. The flow of drugs and migrants into the country is entirely due
to neglecting American duties in the hemisphere.

Donald Trump’s focus on immigration suggests he will make the Western
Hemisphere a priority again, but it remains to be seen if the foreign
policy establishment will go along with it or rethink its tactics.
Thirty years of thuggery not working should cause some rethinking, but
these are people who struggle to learn from failure. The tone of that
tweet from Erik Prince is not encouraging. Perhaps it will take another
failed regime change effort to change some minds.

What is happening in South America is a microcosm for what has been
happening with the American Empire since the Cold War. Everything close
to home is ignored in favor of distant ventures on the periphery of the
empire. Policy makers in Washington think more about infrastructure in
Ukraine than in the United States. The lack of a response to the
hurricane in North Carolina is a great example. If that happened in
Armenia, the empire would have swung into action immediately.

In the area of foreign policy, the empire has been doing what it has
done with regards to domestic policy. The focus is always on what is
furthest away and has the least impact on the citizens. Buckets of tears
are shed over “refugees” entering illegally while the millions of
Americans poisoned by drugs are ignored. Millions are spent on “securing
the safety” of imaginary online communities rather than on the actual
safety of the food supply or the physical health of the American people.

The same hollowing out of American culture and the physical homeland has
been happening with foreign policy. Trillions are spent trying to change
ancient cultures around the globe, while the problems in our backyard
are neglected. The Panama Canal matters far more to Americans than Gaza,
yet the former is neglected, while the latter is an obsession. As with
domestic neglect, there will be a cost to ignoring our backyard in favor
of the other side of the world.
