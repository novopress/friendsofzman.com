The false dichotomy, sometimes called the false choice, is one of the
most popular rhetoric tricks used in liberal democracy. The point is to
frame the debate in such a way as to either avoid some unpleasant topic
or narrow the scope to the benefit of one party in the debate. “We
either do X or we allow this terrible thing to continue” is an effective
way to compel action. After all, everyone knows that doing nothing in
never an acceptable action. Only monsters choose that option.

It is fair to say that our political system is built upon the false
choice. Every election we are asked to choose between the two offerings
put forward by the parties. In most cases, one option is ridiculous.
That is why over 90% of incumbents win reelection. In races with real
competition, the options put forward are nearly identical. Both parties
offer up a plank of wood spouting whatever slogans are popular at the
moment. The voters select between two robots programmed by the same
people.

The reason this is a false choice is there is at least one other option.
The voters could stage a boycott of the election. Maybe demand some
reforms as a condition of rejoining the charade of democracy. Of course,
the voters could riot at the polling stations, hurl the voting machines
into the river and burn the ballots. They could vote for a third party
candidate as a protest. Picking from one of the two options offered up
from the uniparty is a false choice, because there are other options.

Of course, people do not select the other options because they are
constantly reminded that those are all bad options. No rational person
votes third-party. Even the most cynical critics of democracy say the
third party option is a waste of time. Similarly, boycotts are dismissed
as pointless. Rebellion, of course, is dismissed out of hand, despite
the fact the country was literally founded on rebellion. The one thing
everyone seems to agree upon is you have no choice but to pick from the
two parties.

Another example of where the false choice is the foundation of liberal
democracy is in the current Covid panic. The reason the rulers took a
wrecking ball to society is they were sure they had just two options. It
was either the wrecking ball or do nothing and we all know that doing
nothing is never an option. They had to do something, and all of the
choices were bad, so they happily went with the bad option. When you
eliminate the best option, you are always left with the worst options.

The false choice plays out in more subtle ways too. Unwilling to leave
well enough alone, the rulers are now trying to impose a vaccine
passport. The idea is to require this for travel or to attend public
gatherings. Given that liberal democracy looks a lot like fascism,
businesses and banks are making noises about requiring the vaccine in
order to have a job or use the financial system. You can get the
vaccine, the choice is yours, but you may not be able live in society.

People are rightly upset about this turn of events. House broken
conservatives are banging on about how the vaccine passport if just like
when their grandparents made the Jews wear gold stars. The point of the
yes/no debate on the vaccine passport is to distract from the real
problem. The people in charge of public health are incompetent and have
turned a minor public health problem into a disaster. Worse yet, they
seem to take some pleasure in being incompetent at it.

Not so long ago, proof of vaccination was a common requirement for
travel. People were given a card that showed their vaccinations. This
was before computers when the people in charge were somewhat competent
at their jobs. People went along with it because they understood it was
for public health. They could trust the people in charge enough to go
along with it. The people who cured things like polio and smallpox were
proud of it and the policies that made it possible.

Today, of course, no one trusts anyone. There can be no public pride in
collective accomplishment because we have accomplished nothing, other
than putting men in dresses and desecrating some statues. This is why
half the public is skeptical of the vaccine and the passport business.
Instead of dealing with that reality, we choose to have a debate about
the passport itself. The false choice here is whether to get the vaccine
or not. Whether to have a proof of vaccine or not.

The promise of democracy is that public policy is no longer set
according to the narrow interests of a small ruling class. Instead, the
marketplace of democracy will set the priorities and select the polices
based on majority will. In reality, democracy is a mass delusion where
the public debates pointless issues and selects from identical options,
all in order to avoid facing reality. Say what you will about
aristocracy, at least everyone knows who is in charge and who is to
blame.

The Covid hysteria underscores how the false choice society staggers on
through inertia and dumb luck. Faced with a real crisis, the current
regime would collapse in a pile, with the people bickering with one
another over how best to celebrate the pile once the dust settles. The
false choice society is a society built on lies the people tell one
another in order to avoid reality. The trouble is reality is the thing
that does not go away when you stop believing in it.
