The Derek Chauvin trial came to a speedy end yesterday with the jury
finding him guilty on all counts. What this means is they thought he
intentionally caused the death of George Floyd and unintentionally
caused the death of George Floyd. To a normal person, this makes no
sense, but it is another reminder that America stopped being a rational
society a long time ago. In a sensible society, this trial never would
have occurred, because George Floyd would never have existed.

Lots of <a
href="https://www.chron.com/news/article/Cities-brace-for-post-trial-unrest-get-16116261.php"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">people were jubilant</a> over the result.
They do not know why they are happy, as they lack the ability to reflect
on their own actions. They just know that their tribe won and that means
they should be happy. That is the nature of liberal democracy. It is
always about “who” and “whom” because everything is partisan. Those
people celebrating are not happy for themselves. They are happy because
they believe their enemies, real and imagined, are unhappy at the
result.

It is not a lot different than a blood feud. When one side kills a
member of the other side, it is not about righting some wrong or solving
some problem. It is about adding more blood to the feud. That is how the
Left sees white America. It is the people they hate and anything they
can do to harm a white person is automatically good. Most of those
people celebrating know nothing about the law, policing, crime, or the
people involved in the incident. They just know Chauvin is white.

Of course, the other side of this, the sensible white people trying to
make sense of what is happening, are not happy. Many were willing to be
reasonable and meet the other side halfway on this. Maybe Chauvin was
wrong or made a mistake. Maybe he should face some sort of punishment.
Maybe he needs to be made an example so other cops are more careful.
They thought that was the point of the system. The jury would do the
right thing and find a suitable compromise.

Those sensible white people are waking up to the terrible reality of
America. The system they have spent their life trusting is now as
irrational and deranged as those people celebrating in the streets.
America is not the land of Thomas Jefferson, George Washington and the
other Founders. It is not the land of Abraham Lincoln. It is the land of
Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez. They not only run the
country, but the country also runs by the deranged logic of their minds.

For sure, many will rationalize what happened in order to stick to the
old civic nationalist slogans they love so much. “This will be
overturned on appeal” or “we have to take our country back from these
Democrats” will get a lot of play. This is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Prophecy_Fails"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">behavior</a> of people in a cult when the
tenets of the cult are disproven. Instead of accepting that beliefs were
false, they internalize the disconfirmation into a justification for a
more intense commitment. These people will decide to vote harder.

The parasites in Conservative Inc. will fund raise off this, telling
those people desperate for answers that they will fight those liberals
on their behalf. In a bankrupt society like America, every event is a
chance for the grifters to grift a little bit more. You can be sure the
conservative talk show hosts were popping champagne last night when the
verdict was announced. There is nothing better for the conservative
grift than losing, which is why they have been making sure to lose for
generations.

Many though will let go of that last reed that was tethering them to the
old America they grew up believing was real. Many will go through the
stages of grief, maybe skipping to step three by this point. The
realization that this is not their country and they are now second class
citizens will not bring them comfort. It will free their mind of the
frustration of believing in a myth. They will quit Red Team and start
the process of looking for a new team, which will lead them to this side
of the great divide.

This is the reality of a cultural revolution. The people smashing the
system in the name of the revolution are beyond reason. It takes time
for the rational, the people who make society function, to come to grips
with it. Little by little, one martyr at a time, people do come to grips
with this reality. You can be sure that every white cop in America is
having the conversation with his wife right now. He may not know what to
do, but he no longer sees himself and his job the way he did not so long
ago.

It is frustrating, of course, for the people who have been on this side
of the great divide for a long time. How is it that white people cannot
see what is happening and where this must inevitably lead? The fact that
no one was born on this side of the great divide, and we all made our
own journey, is easily forgotten. For those on this side, this is the
new normal and it is hard to imagine thinking any other way. The other
side is a foreign country populated with people living a delusion.

That is the real test in these times. Those who have opened their eyes
and see what is happening have to avoid being bitter about it. The job
at hand is to wake up as many people as possible, ignore those who
cannot open their eyes and help those staggering into the sunlight
adjust to this new normal. There will be many more martyrs in the days
ahead. Every war has them. The challenge is to give their martyrdom
meaning so that one day, there are no more martyrs to our cause.
