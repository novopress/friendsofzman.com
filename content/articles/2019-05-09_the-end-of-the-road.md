At the end of the Cold War, when Francis Fukuyama wrote
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/End-History-Last-Man/dp/0743284550"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The End of History and the
Last Man</em></a>, the belief among the Western elites was that the
great debates were over and liberal democracy was the winner. The days
of nations competing for resources and ideologies competing for
adherents were gone. Instead, liberal democracy would spread to the rest
of the world and capitalism would be the universal economic model. If
there was to be a debate at all, it would be over how best to distribute
the great surplus.

Thirty years later, it seems a bit ridiculous, but in the context of the
age, it was not an unreasonable prediction. The Cold War suppressed
economic development in both the East and West, for close to seventy
years. The West spending lavishly on armaments meant not spending on
other things. The East having embraced communism meant three generations
lost to pointless social experimentation. Stripped of the burden of war,
the world could rapidly develop, unleashing an enormous supply of human
capital.

It did not really turn out that way, of course. The West is noticeably
less free today than it was thirty years ago. The ruling class is
rushing to close off political debate and free expression. In the name
of democracy elites are sending gangs of thugs to harass and assault
people exercising their democratic rights. In the name of capitalism, a
narrowing group of oligarchs are exercising control over large swaths of
the economy. The surveillance state is reaching levels unimaginable
thirty years ago.

In the shadow of this growing authoritarianism sits the political and
cognitive elite, unable to come to terms with what is happening. What is
remarkable about the current age is the public debate, the officially
permitted one, at least, is irrelevant to what is actually happening in
the world. Three years on and the American media is still talking about
invisible gremlins supposedly hypnotizing voters in the 2016 elections.
Meanwhile, millions of barbarians pour over the southern border and the
public space collapses.

This summer, various types of patriotic groups will come to Washington
to demonstrate and proselytize for their constitutional rights. It is a
feature of life in the Imperial Capital that used to go unnoticed.
People demanding free speech by speaking freely in front of the White
House was always a bit amusing. Now, however, those speakers will be
attacked by black clad militants, calling the speakers fascists. The
media will hiss at the speakers, claiming their demands for free speech
are a threat to democracy.

Meanwhile, the supposed conservative opposition will be having name tag
parties where they will talk about the threat of socialism. Nowhere is
the absurdity of the age more obvious than in the so-called conservative
movement. They have coordinated, with the Republican Party, a campaign
to <a
href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/spring-webathon-help-fight-socialist-resurgence/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fight socialism</a>. The
stunning inability to come to terms with present reality is
breathtaking. Their campaign against socialism is every bit as
ridiculous as seeing people walking around dressed in leisure suits.

It is not just right-wing Progressives trapped in the past. What passes
for serious thinking on the Left side is just as vacuous.
<a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">This is a journal</a> published by a Harvard graduate
student that’s popular with the “serious” Progressive. It is every bit
as retrograde and irrelevant as the nonsense belched out by so-called
conservatives. The midget wrestling of this age is two young
intellectuals, like
<a href="https://sociology.fas.harvard.edu/people/nathan-robinson"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nathan Robinson</a> and
<a href="https://www.dailywire.com/authors/ben-shapiro"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ben Shapiro</a>, debating
socialism, using language that fell out of fashion a generation ago.

In all candor, many on the dissident right suffer from the same problem.
Look around the intellectual space – and it is quite vibrant – and you
cannot help but notice that a lot of it is backward looking. A big part
of it is “rediscovering” thinkers from the last century, who were on the
losing side of the great debates of their age. There’s that haunting,
familiar to every southerner, that the wrong side won. If only we could
go back and re-fight those old fights, maybe things would be different.
It’s a longing for an unrealized present.

This antiquarianism is most obvious in the street fights between the
radical Left and radical Right. One side imagines themselves as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotfrontk%C3%A4mpferbund"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rotfrontkämpferbund </a>while
the other side is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturmabteilung"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sturmabteilung</a>. The
silliness of either side thinking they are part of some radical
tradition is obvious. More important, it reveals the lack of original
thinking. Old dead ideas like fascism, anarchism and radical socialism
have little to tell us about politics in the post-industrial,
technological age. It’s nothing more than
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5BivgnvzZE"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">play acting</a> to no end.

Fukuyama was a bit grandiose in pronouncing the end of history, but he
was not wrong about the Cold War marking the end of something. It turns
out that it was the end of the Enlightenment. All of the debates
important to the intellectuals who emerged from the middle ages have
been addressed. There’s nothing left to be said on those topics. It
turns out that much of it was just a dead end. Perhaps all of it. The
resulting conclusions don’t seem to have much value in this
post-Enlightenment age.

Meanwhile, noises coming from the cognitive elites fill the air, but
they mean nothing to any man standing in the current age looking forward
down the timeline. Instead, the noises from these people are like the
wailing of animals trapped in the tar pits. They are sad, mournful and a
bit terrifying, but the only reason to pay any attention to them is to
listen for signs of their waning. Their time is done and once they are
gone, the world can move forward with whatever comes next and stop
thinking about a now dead past.
