When I agreed to go on the Luke Ford show, he said the topics would be
my background, the alt-right and discussion of the JQ. The show was
supposed to be an hour, but turned into three hours, because of loads of
political talk. I don’t do a lot of politics, as I don’t think it
matters that much. For me, politics has been mostly entertainment. My
side has no representation, so the whole thing is foreign to me. Lots of
people like it, though, so doing some politics from time to time is good
for business, if you’re a blogger or podcaster.

I’m also liking the thematic episodes. The feedback has been good, so
doing a full show on Trump makes a lot of sense. The other benefit of
the thematic show is it forces me to think more about the subject. Doing
this episode, I was surprised by how much of what Trump has done is good
for our side. We tend to focus on the bad stuff, but eighteen months of
Trump has been a lot of white pills. It’s not all good, but the bad
stuff is mostly just the lack of good stuff. From a political
perspective, these are good times for our side.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
