I recorded the show just when news of the queen’s passing was hitting
the wires, so it was not on my list of topics. It will no doubt be the
main topic of the news this weekend and into next week. Every loathsome
creature seeking attention will slither forth and say something stupid
in the hope of getting likes. Ours is an undignified age and even the
funeral of a dignified figure will not change it.

Tucker Carlson had a good
<a href="https://twitter.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1568034996622970880"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">monologue</a> on the link between the
queen and the British past, which is now gone for good. Great Britain is
barely a country at this point and it will soon be closer to South
Africa than its glorious past. Like America, Britain is on its way to
becoming a majority-minority society. At that point it ceases to be a
nation or even a country, but simply an administrative zone.

The Queen’s funeral will be a time for the old British to mourn the loss
of their country and its traditions. There will be those who try to
lever this emotion into a rearguard action to fight against the
gathering darkness. Of course, the new British will be out reminding
everyone that the new Britain will be vulgar and coarse. An ungrateful
nation of foreigners will get to be ungrateful one more time.

The new British are not entirely wrong. The old Britain is never coming
back and no one should be mourning its loss. It is the old British who
murdered their society and turned it over to ungrateful foreigners.
Sure, not everyone was onboard with the great replacement, but most of
the British ruling class not only supported the auctioning off of their
heritage, but they continue to celebrate it.

Clearly, something went horribly wrong in that glorious past. There is
no going back and starting over, so the logical thing to do is close the
books on it and begin thinking about what sort of future can be
fashioned from the present. Maybe use thoughts of the glorious past to
maintain a healthy anger at the bastards responsible for wrecking your
country and turning it over to ungrateful foreigners.

Otherwise, the past has little to offer us. The connections have been
severed and we are drifting into uncharted territory. If that glorious
past will be remembered at all in the future, its orphans will have to
be the ones to win the future. That is the next turn of the wheel for
dissidents everywhere. You win the future by preparing to fight for it,
not by agonizing over a past that is gone and never coming back.
