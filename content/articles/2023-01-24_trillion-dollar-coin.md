One of Shakespeare’s most famous lines is from Henry VI. The pretenders
to the throne are plotting and a character named Dick the Butcher says,
“The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers”. The line has been
interpreted many ways within the context of the play, but most people
remember it at face value. In order to get anything done, you must first
get rid of the hairsplitters, gainsayers and schemers that have always
defined the legal profession. It is a lovely thought.

Like all humor, it is funny because it contains a kernel of truth.
Lawyers, given enough time, can fashion an argument for or against
anything. You see this in the recurring debate about the trillion dollar
coin. This is the claim that the executive can get around Congressional
spending and borrowing limits by minting a trillion dollar coin. The
mint would strike a coin whose value would result in one trillion in
seigniorage . This is the difference between the value of the coin and
its cost.

The [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trillion-dollar_coin) on
this topic is both amusing and informative. Normal people would
naturally assume that the government cannot invent out of thin air a
trillion dollar coin, but the lawyers have found a way. At least they
have found a legal justification for conjuring such a coin. The
mechanics of how this would work are a bit sketchy, but lawyers never
let practical reality get in the way of a good idea. We will be hearing
lots from them during the coming debt ceiling debate.

The basic argument here is that the mint has the legal right to sell
bullion coins, circulating coins and numismatic items. That means they
can take gold and make a gold coin and sell it. They can also make
collectors items and sell those. They can also buy and sell circulating
coins at a profit. Since the mint is charged with striking circulating
coins for the Treasury, they also make a profit from this. These sales
pay for mint operations and profits go to the Treasury.

The claim here is the mint could create a trillion dollar coin that has
the cost of the materials and the labor to make it. Since these are
tiny, relative to the face value of the coin, the seigniorage would be
roughly one trillion dollars. This would then be handed over to the
Treasury to spend on government. Congress is cut out of the process, as
they do not control the mint. That also means the Treasury could bypass
the debt limit as they would have a trillion dollars.

If this sounds insane, you are in luck. It is insane. When the mint
strikes a novelty item for collectors, they actually sell it to
collectors. They price the item based on estimated demand and the cost
of production. Like any business they are seeking to make a profit from
these sales. The reason buyers are willing to pay more for a novelty
item than the value of its base metal is they think it will fetch more
on the secondary market because of its limited production run.

Another way to think of it is the trading card makers. They will create
a special limited edition run of cards. They use the same paper and the
same images as other cards, but these cards are limited in number. Maybe
they have a special imprint or these days a holographic stamp on them.
Collectors will pay a premium for these cards on the assumption that
they will be worth more in the future. Of course, card collectors also
buy for their own collections.

Who will pay a trillion dollars for a coin? The answer is no one.
Markets can only work if there are buyers and sellers. Who would be the
trillion dollar buyer? The only plausible buyer is the Federal Reserve.
To do this they can liquidate assets from their balance sheet in the
open market, then use the proceeds to buy the coin. There are two
problems with this idea. One is the banks would be taking a trillion
dollars out of the economy and flooding the market with various assets.

The other problem is the central bank could not plausibly list this new
coin as an asset as the coin has a market value of zero. Again, a thing
is worth what someone will pay for it and in the case of a coin with one
possible customer, the value of the coin must by definition drop to zero
when the customer acquires it. In effect, the Fed will have handed the
mint a trillion dollars for nothing and the mint would then turn that
trillion over to the Treasury as a profit.

There is an old joke that goes something like this. A rich man is
traveling in Europe and finds himself in a small town. He needs a place
to stay, so he goes to the one inn and asks for a room for the night. He
slaps down a thousand euros and tells the innkeeper that he wants the
best room he has to offer. The innkeeper takes the money and tells the
man that he can take any room he likes. The man goes upstairs to look at
the rooms and the innkeeper leaves to see the grocer.

You see, the innkeeper owed the grocer a thousand euros so he wanted to
pay him off before the grocer cut him off. The grocer is happy to be
paid. He takes the money and immediately heads off to his landlord to
whom he owes back rent. He pays off the landlord with the one thousand
euros. The landlord, who has a taste for prostitutes, takes the money
and pays off the madam. The madam then heads off to the innkeeper to pay
him for the use of his rooms.

Meanwhile, the traveler comes back down and tells the innkeeper that he
does not find any of the rooms satisfactory and demands his money back.
The innkeeper is happy to refund him the one thousand euros, as he just
got them from the madam. The traveler leaves, but everyone in the town
has been made whole. The innkeeper paid his debt to the grocer, the
grocer paid his landlord and the landlord paid the madam, who then paid
off the innkeeper.

The joke is the economy works just fine as long as the money keeps
flowing and there is always some new money from outside to prime the
pumps. As soon as we run short of outsiders with the extra cash, the
system locks up. This is what the trillion dollar coin idea amounts to
in the end. The Fed artificially increases the balances of member banks
so they can buy assets from the Fed. Those banks then become the man
looking for a room in that old gag.

The coming debt limit drama and the inevitable howling from the crazies
about the need to get around this problem with crackpot ideas like the
trillion dollar coin mask a much deeper problem. Washington famously
said, “The last official act of any government is to loot the treasury.”
That is what these debt limit fights are about when you examine them
without the lawyers present. It is just a debate about how best to
continue looting the treasury before it all comes crashing down.
