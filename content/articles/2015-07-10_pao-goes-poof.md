The conniving adventuress and grifter <a
href="http://www.wired.com/2015/07/reddit-ceo-ellen-pao-steps-down-huffman-replacement/?mbid=social_twitter"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ellen Pao has been sacked</a>.

*<span class="lede" tabindex="-1">Reddit interim CEO </span>Ellen Pao
resigned today after facing an all-out revolt on the site in the wake of
the firing of a popular employee. Steve Huffman, Reddit’s original CEO
and co-founder of the site a decade ago, is taking over the job,
effective immediately.*

*“Ellen Pao resigned from Reddit today by mutual agreement,” Reddit
co-founder Alexis Ohanian [wrote in a post on the
site](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cucye/an_old_team_at_reddit/).
He said Pao would remain an advisor to Reddit’s board through the end of
the year. “She brought a face to Reddit that changed perceptions, and is
a pioneer for women in the tech industry.”*

I get why companies say nice things about the dirtball they just canned.
There’s nothing to be gained by trashing the fired person and there’s no
need to risk a lawsuit. Ellen Pao does have a habit of suing employers
so it is best to leave sleeping dogs lie, I guess.

In this case, the tongue in cheek praise is probably better than
speaking truthfully. They hired the dumb twat because she has a vagina
and is Asian. That’s the new face they reference. She was laughably
horrible at her job, thus changing the perception that Asians are hard
working and smart.

*On Monday, Pao [took to
Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cbo4m/we_apologize/)
to apologize for the incident, as well as years of mismanagement and
poor communication between the company and the band of unpaid volunteer
moderators who keep the site going.*

*As of Tuesday, a public petition on social justice platform Change.org
demanding Pao’s resignation had garnered close to 200,000 signatures.*

One of the unexpected consequences of social media is it fools people in
leadership positions into thinking what is trendy with a handful of
weirdos is a broad social movement. America is a country of 320 million.
You can get 200,000 people to agree to drink Drano if just ask. But,
200,000 is a big number so it makes a big impact on the minds of people
running a company like Reddit.

Of course, most of these social media protestors are robots and sock
puppets. A deranged idiot with 85 twitter accounts spending all day
messaging people looks like a mass movement. <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">The crackpots harassing Rush Limbaugh
last year</a> turned out to be seven mental patients with thousands of
e-mail accounts. Social media is a megaphone for maniacs.

As is always the case with the Cult, they turned Pao into a hero, not
because they gave a crap about Pao, but because she was a convenient
club to use in their fight against normal white people. Now that she is
a two-time loser, I suspect she falls down the memory hole and goes back
to selling knock-off handbags on-line.
