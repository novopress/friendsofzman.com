Watching the tunneling Hebrews scurrying out of their warrens the other
day, my first thought was why did the government let these people into
the country. The original cult members came over during the war, so
maybe no one noticed, but since then they keep coming and there is no
excuse for not noticing the weirdness. No offense to these people, but
we have our own weirdos. We are full up.

Of course, no one is allowed to notice such things or notice anything
about people unless it furthers the goal of eliminating “who” from our
reality. We can notice blacks in the context of them being the victims
of whiteness and we can notice whites as oppressors, but this in
furtherance of dismantling the “how” of things so that these identities
are no longer a part of contextual reality.

Otherwise, talking about who is doing anything is increasingly off
limits, to the point where police sketches will soon be stick figures.
Most normies looked away from the images of those Jewish guys crawling
out of the sewer grates because the only way to understand it was to
think about who these people are what makes them so different from what
we consider normal in America.

This aversion to *who* and the preference for *how* is not new. This is
part of the Western intellectual tradition and is now reaching a peak.
Transgenderism is the logical endpoint of universalism, which strips the
who from the moral debate. If anyone can be inside the Western moral
framework, then people no longer have fixed identities. If a man can be
anything he wants, then logically he can even be a girl.
