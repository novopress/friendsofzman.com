If there was ever any doubt that the cult of diversity was, in fact, a
cult, <a
href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn-school-cutting-gifted-program-boost-diversity-article-1.1595864"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this should dispel those
doubts</a>.

*A popular gifted program will get the axe after Ditmas Park school
officials chose diversity over exclusivity.*

*Citing a lack of diversity, PS 139 Principal Mary McDonald informed
parents in a letter that the Students of Academic Rigor and two other
in-house programs would no longer accept applications for incoming
kindergartners.*

*“Our Kindergarten classes will be heterogeneously grouped to reflect
the diversity of our student body and the community we live in,”
McDonald told parents in a letter posted on the photo-sharing site
flickr <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and obtained by Ditmas Park
Corner</a>.*

The benefit of diversity, however it is defined, has never been
established, beyond some wild claims by people in the diversity rackets.
History, on the other hand, shows humans have been against diversity
since the dawn of time. In fact, <a
href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/05/the_downside_of_diversity/?page=full"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">diversity is most likely bad
for human communities</a>. The evidence thus far shows that the greater
the diversity, the weaker the community, as fewer people volunteer and
participate in the running of the community.

We are tribal animals and that means being around people like us.
100,000 years or so of evolution is not going to yield to wishful
thinking from people who tend not to live the diverse lifestyle. That’s
the thing with the cult of diversity. The preachers tend to live in
homogeneous communities, which means white communities. You never hear
black people in the ghetto talking about diversity. The only time blacks
use the word is as code to mean lots of black people, which is how white
people are now using it.

This particular school is in a gentrifying neighborhood, which means
loads of middle-class white women pretending to be artists as they live
like June Cleaver. That’s the other thing about the diversity cult. The
women all pretend to be artsy feminists, but they live like a 1950’s
house wife, including the husband with the good job. All of their
progressive posturing is intended to conceal the very real fact they
live a very homogeneous life. Multiculturalism is a burka they throw
over their life.
