Way back in the olden thymes, when companies were getting on-line to
sell stuff, it looked like Amazon picked a strange market to exploit.
Buying books on-line was not a great leap forward, but Bezos knew
something the rest of us did not. He knew that a business that flattered
the beautiful people would have an army of beautiful people promoting it
to the rest of us. It was the central insight of Steve Jobs. He was the
post-modern P. T. Barnum, selling the glorious future rather than a
glimpse of the wolf-boy or the tattooed lady.

Amazon never made money selling books, but before anyone could pay too
close attention to that, Bezos moved onto selling other stuff. When that
failed to turn a profit, he got into selling music, then it was movies
and TV shows. Amazon eventually turned a profit, but the total profit
for the firm over its history amounts to what a company like ExxonMobil
generates in a good month. Now, Amazon is promising to have drone robots
deliver your goods before you even decide to order them. The future will
be glorious.

The key for Amazon making it all these years was to keep people focused
on everything but their financials. This is not an exception. Faceberg
will never have earnings to justify its share price. In fact, it will
never have user rates to justify its ad revenue. It’s not unreasonable
to think that <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">everything about the business is
fraudulent</a>. That should trigger large scale audits and
investigations into its business practices, but Facebook is on the side
of angels in the cultural revolution, so its all good.

Probably the best example of our carny-barker economy is Tesla. To his
credit, Musk has built a real factory that builds real cars. No one is
going to say the Tesla is a work of art or even a practical car, but it
is a car and the technology is impressive. The trouble is the company
does not exist to make cars. It operates as a tax sink, where government
subsidies flow into it and some portion of those subsidies turn into
payments to the principles in the form of stock repurchases, debt
service and compensation.

This only works if people think the venture will either one day turn a
profit or the technology that it creates will result in something good
down the road. To that end, Musk is regularly out doing his
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDOI0cq6GZM" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Lyle Lanley act</a>, making all the beautiful people
feel righteous by backing his ventures. He’s also telling Wall Street
that he will soon be making and selling enough cars to turn a healthy
profit, even without massive tax subsidies. The trouble is, <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">that’s probably never happening</a>, at
least not with current management.

What we are seeing with Tesla is pretty much what we saw with Amazon.
Tesla is a great show so the tax subsidies will not be shut off. Amazon
avoided paying sales taxes for years this way. Rich people think Musk is
cool and it is currently hip to have one of his cars as a toy, so there
will be no push to cut the apron strings. That means Wall Street
investors will stay in the game, even though they have people who know
there is zero chance for Tesla to profitably make cars anytime soon.

In fairness, this sort of chicanery is not new. The industrial age saw
similar rackets, which is how great public works projects were built.
The government turned a blind eye to the cost shifting and corruption,
as that seemed like a reasonable price to pay for a bridge or a
hydroelectric damn. It was not just corruption. Railroads and power
companies trampled on the rights of citizens to build out their
networks. Despite all that, the people still got trains,
electrification, bridges and roads. People can accept those trade-offs.

Whether or not that will hold in the technological age is debatable. The
collapsed retail sector has left retail centers looking like ghost
towns. Getting cheap stuff on-line is not exactly a great legacy,
compared to rural electrification. On the other hand, maybe battery
powered, self-driving cars will be seen as having been worth the massive
debt and tax shifting that is so much of the modern economy. And, unlike
the robber barons, guys like Bezos, Musk and Zuckerberg put on a good
show, so there’s that.
