The first time I heard this song in full was on the way back to
Massachusetts. It was the day before Thanksgiving and it was snowing.
Driving through Stockbridge, I came upon a cop who had pulled over a car
full of hippy looking degenerates. I stopped and offered to help him
beat the hippies. He was more than happy to let me join in on the fun.
Before long there was a whole gang of us, beating hippies and enjoying
good fellowship. Thereâ€™s really nothing like the holiday season to bring
out the best in people.

Happy Thanksgiving everyone.
