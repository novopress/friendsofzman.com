There are several remarkable things happening in response to the massive
push back from Americans to the oligarchic coup we are seeing unfold.
The one getting the most attention, of course, is the hysterical
reaction by the political class. Their rhetoric is so out of sync with
reality it suggests mental illness. One thing not getting noticed is how
Conservative Inc. appears to collapsing right in front of us. Look at
the flagship of that racket, National Review, and it should have
tumbleweeds on it.

Their first big <a
href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-cure-for-trumpism-reaganism/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">think piece</a> in response to the
epiphany protests was something so bizarre that it could have been from
the Babylon Bee. Put aside for a second that most people in America have
no memory of Reagan. These are people endlessly howling about the need
to court nonwhites and that nonwhites are their future. The typical
black is 27 years old and the typical Hispanic is 11 years old. Talking
about Reagan to these people is like talking about Frederick the Great
or Napoleon.

Look into that piece and the writer’s cure for what ails the country is
the exact thing 75 million people voted against twice. Being the party
of global enterprise at the expense of the culture and spiritual welfare
of the people is why the Republican Party is headed to the dustbin of
history. Tone? The GOP has been obsessed with tone policing everyone for
generations now. The reason people voted for the loudmouth is they are
sick of being told they cannot speak out against what is happening.

Of course, the slovenly Kevin Williamson has been
<a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/author/kevin-d-williamson/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">pounding away</a> at Trump and Trump
voters in service to his paymasters in the uniparty. What you have to
admire about Williamson is that he is loyal to his paymasters. Most
pens-for-hire show a little reluctance, as their conscience tends to
gnaw at them. Not old Kev. He was bought to be a foaming-at-the-mouth
Trump-hater back in 2015 and he stays bought. The Iranians use guys like
this to clear mine fields.

His most amusing post of the bunch thus far is <a
href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/01/task-ahead-for-conservatives-in-the-biden-age/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">this one</a>, where he lays out his big
strategy for the collection of rent boys and house slaves called the
conservative movement. Down in the middle he writes, “The big technology
companies are the most successful thing going economically in the United
States; the Europeans, who have nothing to compare to a Facebook or a
Google, resent them and fear them; Democrats hate them, blaming Facebook
for the election of Trump in 2016.”

This is what most people used to call a bald-faced lie. The Democrats
love the tech oligarchs every bit as much as National Review and for the
same reason. They both get gobs of cash from the Silicon Valley
oligarchs. The tech companies are systematically erasing anything
resembling dissent to the official orthodoxy. They are even erasing
people Williamson would call allies. For old Kev, the only allies are
those who can keep his refrigerators stocked. He’s happy to be an organ
grinder’s monkey.

Of course, you see nothing on National Review concerning the most
relevant issue of the day, which is tech censorship. For a collection of
people who amusingly insist they are a movement, you would think they
would have something to say about the thing everyone is discussing. The
one exception is <a
href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/01/assault-on-the-capitol-has-let-loose-the-electronic-octopus/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">the piece</a> they get from Victor David
Hanson, but he has no role in the editorial stance of the site. In fact,
he is notable in being the last actual conservative writing for the
site.

Of course, Conservative Inc. is not just National Review, but it has
always been the canary in the coal mine. The more vibrant and active
sites are shifting into the populist camp as they realize there is no
future with the National Review types. The average age of a NRO reader
is over 70 now. You’ll note that most of their stories get few comments
and that is because many nursing homes no longer provide free internet
access to their patients.

All of this is good news. The National Review type has always been a
hindrance to the genuine right-wing, because they operate as the “good”
conservative. That is, the Left anoints them as the opposition, so money
and attention flow to them. Meanwhile, the genuine opposition to the
Left is begging for scraps and attention. Stripped of that credibility,
it is no longer possible for them to play that role. The money will
continue to dry up and National Review will go the way of all legacy
media.

All of this points to something much bigger. What has unfolded since the
election has opened the eyes of millions of people. Despite the rhetoric
from their cult leaders, even many lefties are getting nervous about
what is happening. They live close enough to reality to know what lies
ahead if we keep on this pace. For Conservative Inc., it means they no
longer have an audience hoping that a settlement can be negotiated with
their friends on the Left. Principled surrender is no longer an option.
