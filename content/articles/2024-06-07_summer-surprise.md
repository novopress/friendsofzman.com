The real power of the media is the power to ignore, so noticing what
they ignore is a good way to get a sense of what is happening in the
regime. Sometimes they ignore something because it has no interest to
the rulers and sometimes it is just to prevent anyone from discussing
it. There are times when the media gives something a good leaving alone
because the regime does not know how to respond.

The Trump verdict may be the last option. We had the usual stuff on the
day it happened, but then the story sort of just disappeared. There were
a few conservative cucks doing their normal cuckery, but otherwise the
conservatives followed the crowd, which laughed and jeered the verdict.
The kooks even had to accept that this was not going to be the winner
they imagined. As a result, the story just died.

One possible reason is the verdict has created more problems for the
regime, as no one has any idea what to do about it. The whole point of
the lawfare gambit was to scare away Trump’s support or bully him out of
the race. Instead, he has bulled his way forward to the nomination and
he has more support than ever. Like Project Ukraine, the prophesies have
not come true and there is no plan B.

There may be other things going on behind the scenes. There are signs
that the people with real power are worried about what is going on and
this Trump verdict may simply be another log on the fire. That is the
show this week. It is a bit of thinking out loud about what could be
going on with our rulers and what sort of surprises they may have for us
this summer.
