Until about an hour ago, I had never heard of Ekaterina Jung, now
calling herself Cathy Young, a writer for something called Newsday and
the website, The Federalist. <a
href="http://thefederalist.com/2016/04/14/you-cant-whitewash-the-alt-rights-bigotry/#disqus_thread"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This link</a> was in my
twitter feed along with a bunch of snarky comments. The article is
another tantrum about the growing army of people who have had enough of
so-called conservatism and went elsewhere for their arguments.

The phrase “alt-right” has become an abracadabra phrase for the
commercial Right, in the same way that “extreme right-wing” is a magic
phrase for the loonies of the Left. The theory is that if the
good-thinker says the phrase three times, their tired old excuses and
arguments are declared the winner and they can dismiss their critics.
The hacks of Conservative Inc now call everyone to their right,
“alt-right” so they can avoid debating them.

The Cathy Young tantrum is fairly typical. She spent an hour breezing
through some sites like VDare and Unz looking for “evidence” she could
use to pad out her claim that the bad-thinkers are all racist Hitlers
and stuff. I’m old enough to remember when Lefty used to write these
sorts of columns about Buckley Conservatives, using National Review as
the source material. That’s how far the Overton Window has moved left.

Anyway, two things are interesting to me. One is the bio of the writer.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Young"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to Wiki</a>:

*Born in [Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow "Moscow"), the
capital of what was then the [Soviet
Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union"),
Ekaterina Jung was 17 when her family emigrated to the United States in
1980. She became a naturalized citizen in 1987 as Catherine Alicia
Young, and graduated from [Rutgers
University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_University "Rutgers University")
in
1988.<sup>[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Young#cite_note-1)</sup>
At Rutgers, she wrote a column for the student newspaper [The Daily
Targum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Targum "The Daily Targum")
and worked as a student writer for [The Detroit
News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Detroit_News "The Detroit News").
She also completed her autobiography, Growing Up in Moscow: Memories of
a Soviet Girlhood, published in 1989.*

*Continuing her association with The Detroit News, Young was a regular
columnist for the newspaper from 1993 to 2000 and worked as a freelance
journalist for a variety of publications including [The New York
Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times"),
[The Washington
Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post "The Washington Post"),
[The Philadelphia
Inquirer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Philadelphia_Inquirer "The Philadelphia Inquirer"),
[Newsday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsday "Newsday"), [The New
Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Republic "The New Republic"),
[The Wall Street
Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal "The Wall Street Journal"),
[The American
Spectator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Spectator "The American Spectator"),
[National
Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Review "National Review"),
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon.com" class="mw-redirect"
title="Salon.com">Salon.com</a>, [The Weekly
Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weekly_Standard "The Weekly Standard"),
and
[Reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason_(magazine) "Reason (magazine)").*

*From 2000 to 2007, Young wrote a weekly op-ed column for [The Boston
Globe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Globe "The Boston Globe").
In 2008, she began to write a regular column for RealClearPolitics.com.
In 2012, she became a weekly columnist for Newsday. Over the years,
Young has had a close association with Reason, where she is a
contributing editor and was a monthly columnist from 2001 to 2007. Since
2014, she has regularly contributed to
Time.<sup>[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Young#cite_note-2)</sup>*

*Young is a research associate at the [Washington,
D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C.")-based
libertarian think tank [Cato
Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_Institute "Cato Institute"),
for which she co-authored a 1996 policy analysis paper, “Feminist
Jurisprudence: Equal Rights or Neo-Paternalism?”. Her writing covers a
variety of topics in politics and culture, with particular focus on
gender issues and feminism, reflecting an [individualist
feminist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualist_feminism "Individualist feminism")
perspective (c.f. [Wendy
McElroy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_McElroy "Wendy McElroy")),
frequently agreeing with [men’s rights
activists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_movement "Men's movement"),
while criticizing them for emulating the [identity
politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics "Identity politics")
associated with some forms of feminism. In addition to appearing on a
number of radio and television shows, she has spoken on college campuses
and, during 2001 and 2002, taught a 3-week gender issues course at
[Colorado
College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_College "Colorado College").*

*Young supports legally recognizing same-sex
marriages.<sup>[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Young#cite_note-3)</sup>*

Young is basically a liberal woman who likes money so she defends the
people who give her money. Today, that happens to be the Koch Brothers
so she is a libertarian. You don’t write for those hyper-progressive
publications without having been cleared by the Cult of Modern
Liberalism. Throw in the middle-aged woman’s obsession with her vagina
and you have a Cato endorsed social justice warrior.

That’s the thing with libertarians. They agree with the Left on all the
important stuff. Their quibble is mostly over who gets sent off to the
camps and by what means. Liberals want the state running the camps while
libertarians think Elon Musk should get the contract. Over 50 years ago,
<a
href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/213298/big-sister-watching-you-whittaker-chambers"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Whittaker Chambers pegged
these people</a> and nothing much has changed, other than the fact the
Buckley Conservatives surrendered to them.

The other interesting bit is this at the end of the Young’s tantrum:

*Today, the excesses of the “social justice” movement have brought us to
a point where reasonable conservatives, libertarians, and liberals are
ready to join forces against quasi-totalitarian identity politics. We
need to start reclaiming the principles of common humanity, freedom, and
universal values, not put a positive spin on a different brand of
divisive identitarianism.*

Progressivism is based on the claim that all humans are the same.
Egalitarianism is the foundation stone of the Left. Their coat of arms
is decorated with the phrases “common humanity” and “universal values.”
These are not conservative expressions or sentiments. They are
antithetical to traditionalism, conservatism and biological reality.
What Cathy Young finishes with is a call for total surrender.

That’s why the Buckley Right is collapsing. Decades of surrender and
excuse making have sapped them of their legitimacy. What’s the point of
following these guys if all they do is lose and blame you for it? You
may as well throw in with these new guys, who may be nuts, but they are
spoiling for a fight. If your culture and people are going to be erased
from the book of life, you can at least put up a fight on the way out.
