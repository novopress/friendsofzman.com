I was listening to Imus this morning and he was gas-bagging about the
Ferguson shooting. He said something stupid, but obviously intended to
tell the rulers he was not going to be any trouble on the subject. Since
his return from exile, Imus has been extremely careful about anything
touching on race. In fact, he has been very sensitive about the whole
metastasizing list of official taboos.

This is becoming more and more common. As the lunatics get better and
better at ruining careers, the people on radio and television become
increasingly frightened and cautious. I still watch Red Eye, for
example, but it is so tame now I hardly see the point in watching it.
Every show they do a segment on how much they love homos or trannies
now. Once in a  while they worship a black guy. I fast forward through
the piety segments, but sometimes that’s most of the show.

Anyway, he said something about how the cop had no right to shoot the
big black guy in question. His argument was that there are no
circumstance in which a cop can shoot an unarmed person. I’m a police
skeptic and I said from the start that I would need a strong case to
justify this shooting. Getting bashed in the face by a giant and then
having said giant come back for another shot is enough for me.

In fact, it is enough for everyone in most states. When you get a
concealed carry in most states, you learn when you can use lethal force.
The first rule you learn is the seven yard rule. When the bad guy is
within 20 feet, it is assumed retreat is impossible. About 20 states do
not require any retreat whatsoever. Others have laws on the books
requiring a citizen to take reasonable steps to get away from the bad
guy. Once the bad guy gets close, however, you can do what you need to
do to avoid harm.

That rule applies to cops too. This guy is not required to take a
beating just because the giant did not have a weapon. Once the giant
punched the cop, the cop had every right to assume the giant posed a
threat. The only two questions left are how close was the giant when the
cop fired on him and was the giant coming forward toward the cop. If the
giant was running away or surrendering, then the cop is guilty of
murder. If the giant was a block away then the cop is guilty of murder.

What we know so far is that the cop was struck in his car hard enough to
fracture his eye socket. That sounds worse than it is as that part of
the skull is fragile. Boxers suffer broken orbital bones frequently.
Still, it takes a big hit to cause that level of damage. The other thing
we know is the giant was shot in the front. Assuming the autopsy report
is correct, his arms were at his sides and he was facing the cop. What
we don’t know is if the giant was surrendering or advancing. Witness
accounts are all over the place and press accounts are full of
deliberate lies.

That’s what makes
<a href="http://market-ticker.org/akcs-www?post=229323"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this post from the
increasingly deranged Karl Denninger</a> hilariously stupid. He’s
arguing that the cop can only shoot the giant if the giant is actively
attacking the cop. Not even the Brits have laws like this. In America,
no one, not even the cop, has to submit to a beating in order to claim
self-defense. Otherwise, there’s no such thing as self-defense and
there’s no reason to give the cops guns.
