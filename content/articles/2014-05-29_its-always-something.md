People in the stock trading business always have a reason to buy stocks.
If the market is falling, it is a great time to bargain hunt. If the
market is soaring, you have to get in while the getting is good. A
nuclear strike incinerating NYC would not be enough to discourage these
guys. That’s the business. It’s a form of gambling and they are addicted
to it. They love the action in the same way a base jumper loves the
thrill of the activity. It’s not rational, but emotional.

CNBC exists to gaslight these types. No matter what, they can see the
bright side of what is happening in the markets.

target="_blank">Today’s revised Q1 GDP</a> is a good example.

*The U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter for the first time in
three years as it buckled under the weight of a severe winter, but there
are signs activity has since rebounded.*

Yeah, suddenly we’re all hot house flowers incapable of handling a
little snow.

*The decline in output, which also reflected a plunge in business
spending on nonresidential structures, was sharper than Wall Street’s
expectations. Economists had expected the revision to show GDP
contracting at a 0.5 percent rate.*

*The economy grew at a 2.6 percent pace in the fourth quarter. U.S.
financial markets are likely to shrug off the report, given the
temporary factors that weighed down on growth and the fact that economic
activity is rebounding.*

*Data ranging from employment to manufacturing suggests growth will
accelerate sharply in the second quarter.*

*Economists estimate severe weather could have chopped off as much as
1.5 percentage points from GDP growth. **The government, however, gave
no details on the impact of the weather.***

Weather could have been a cause. Magic evil leprechauns could be the
cause too. We don’t know, but let’s go with weather because we don’t
think it was leprechauns.

*Businesses accumulated $49.0 billion worth of inventories, far less
than the $87.4 billion estimated last month.*

*It was the smallest amount in a year and left inventories subtracting
1.62 percentage points from first-quarter growth. But inventories should
be a boost to second-quarter growth.*

*While the decline in exports was not as severe as initially thought,
import growth was stronger. That resulted in a trade deficit that sliced
off 0.95 percentage point from GDP growth.*

*A measure of domestic demand that strips out exports and inventories
expanded at a 1.6 percent rate, rather than a 1.5 percent rate,
indicating underlying strength in the economy.*

*Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S.
economic activity, increased at a 3.1 percent rate. It was previously
reported to have advanced at a 3.0 percent pace.*

*Spending was boosted by the Affordable Healthcare Act, which expanded
healthcare coverage to many Americans. Consumer spending had increased
at a brisk 3.3 percent pace in the fourth quarter.*

*Business spending on nonresidential structures, such as gas drilling,
contracted at a 7.5 percent rate. It had previously been reported to
have increased at a 0.2 percent pace. The report showed corporate
profits after tax plunged at a 13.7 percent rate, the biggest drop since
the fourth quarter of 2008.*

Let’s see. Demand was higher, but profits were smaller. Business, for
some reason, reduced inventories. But wait. Consumer spending was not
higher on things people want like new TV’s and cars. It was higher for
stuff they don’t want like health care. My goodness. Does anyone even
bother to read the copy before it goes to press?
