The term “woke” started turning up in mainstream discourse about a
decade ago as part of the cultural revolution from the top. When this
current phase started is debatable, but the term “woke” started
circulating around social media in the Obama years, which means we are
into the second decade of the woke phenomenon. In fact, it has been
around long enough to become a bit dated.

Interestingly, the word and the concept did not originate inside the
academy. A century ago, a black blues singer calling himself Lead Belly
urged his listeners to “stay woke” in a song about blacks being falsely
accused of rape by whites. The term and concept caught on among blacks
as a warning about accepting the reality of white America as advertised
and instead accepting the lived reality of black Americans.

In the middle of the last century, upper-middle-class white feminists
culturally appropriated the term to criticize what they called the white
patriarchy and then woke was off and running in the academy and then
society. As with so many things, the managerial class, devoid of any
creative or critical thinking, pilfered an idea from black culture in
order to pretend to have a culture of their own.

It is why the concept of cultural appropriation was so easily adopted by
the people flying the woke flag outside their mansions. They could
easily imagine the damage done by frat boys wearing sombreros at their
Cinco de Mayo party because they themselves have been pillaging the
cultures over which they rule. The culture of the ruling class is a
self-critique projected onto the masses.

Putting that aside, the appeal of “woke” to the managerial class, as
well as the adjunct professor living in her car, may be caused by
something other than cultural barrenness and ideological fervor. When
you get past the lunacy, there are traces of the same impulse found in
the transcendental movement. There are some strong parallels between the
main concepts in both.

That is what the show is about this week. In the first half we cover the
two main concepts of what most mean when they use the word “woke”. The
second half of the show is a very brief discussion of Emerson and his
classic lecture to the Harvard Divinity School, along with a reading
from Thoreau. The idea is to see if “woke” is just the current
manifestation of the American moral imperative.
