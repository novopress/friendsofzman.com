A point I like to make about libertarianism is that while there can
never be a libertarian society, libertarianism can be useful as a
critical tool. In the last century it was useful in analyzing and
confronting socialist economic policy. The “science” of the marketplace
was good at dispelling the morality of left-wing claims. The market
economy provided more people with more goods and services at fair prices
than the models that claimed to defend the interests of the masses.

The ethnostate is similar to libertarianism in that there is no way to
go from current social arrangements to an ethnostate. Even in places
that have an ethnocracy, like Israel, going the next step is impossible.
Even the most clannish societies have some outsiders in their midst.
Even so, the model is useful when confronting the claims of diversity
and multiculturalism. The ethnostate model exposes the contradictions
and false claims at the center of post-Marx culturalism.

Ethnocracy, on the other hand, is possible. Israel is the obvious
example of a country arranged so that the dominant ethnic group remains
in power. Syria is another example of an ethnocracy, one ruled by a
minority. You can probably classify post-Civil War America as an
ethnocracy, ruled by the Yankee elite. The image of the WASP aristocrat
is drawn from this reality. A good show might be an examination of
American history through the lens of ethnocracy.

These examples are useful in understanding what is happening in the West
and in thinking about alternative political models. Majority populations
in the West used to unabashedly work to promote the interests of the
majority, but then the poles reversed and majoritarianism became taboo.
The concept of the ethnostate is useful in understanding why this
happened. There is something about Europeans that make us open to
division and internal conflict.
