When I was a kid, it was part of the holiday season to see politicians
participating in the rituals of Christmas. The President would show up
at a church somewhere to participate in a Christian mass, even if he was
not a member of that particular sect. The exception was that
non-Catholics would not take communion at a Catholic mass, out of
respect to Catholics. Otherwise, it was considered a sign of respect for
leaders to show up at a church at times like Christmas.

Similarly, political leaders would show up at a military memorial on
veterans holidays to lay a wreath, say a prayer and demonstrate a proper
reverence. On the 50th anniversary of D-Day, Ronald Reagan made a week
out of showing his respect for the men and women, who saved Europe from
herself. Even communist mayors of progressive American cities knew to
show respect to veterans on those holidays. The point was for the people
to see that these public figures were pious and shared our fidelity to
the cultural institutions of society.

Public acts of piety by leaders are a part of settled society and an
integral part of political leadership. Scipio Africanus, the great Roman
general, is famous to modern people for defeating Hannibal at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Zama"
target="_blank">Zama</a>. In his day, he was famous to his
contemporaries for his great displays of public piety and his use of
them to win the support of the people in order to defeat his political
enemies. Roman emperors invested a great deal of wealth and time into
public acts of piety, building great temples and holding elaborately
expensive public events. Public piety is a feature of human society.

That’s an important thing to keep in mind when watching our public
figures perform in public. In almost all cases, these performances are
carefully considered and choreographed. They are intended to win support
for the public figure. If they are attached to a cause, the way to bet
is the public figure cares little for the cause, but is simply using it
to curry favor with the public. <span style="font-weight: 300;">The
point is for you to walk away thinking the public person is moral and
good, and therefore deserving of your support.</span>

This is the case with <a
href="http://spacecoastdaily.com/2016/09/atlantic-coast-conference-follows-ncaas-lead-moves-championships-from-north-carolina/"
target="_blank">the Atlantic Coast Conference announcing that they will
be pulling their sportsball tournaments out of the state of North
Carolina</a> in protest of the state law banning deranged men in
sundresses from stalking women in public toilets. For those unfamiliar
with American college sports, our colleges run billion dollar sports
leagues for some reason. How this happened would take a long to explain,
but imagine if your football leagues were all owned and operated by your
colleges and universities.

Here’s the statement from the college presidents:

> “As members of the Atlantic Coast Conference, the ACC Council of
> Presidents reaffirmed our collective commitment to uphold the values
> of equality, diversity, inclusion and non-discrimination. Every one of
> our 15 universities is strongly committed to these values and
> therefore, we will continue to host ACC Championships at campus sites.
> We believe North Carolina House Bill 2 is inconsistent with these
> values, and as a result, we will relocate all neutral site
> championships for the 2016-17 academic year. All locations will be
> announced in the future from the conference office.”

Clearly, an army of public relations people worked on this statement for
weeks so that it is packed the most pious punch possible. It has all the
abracadabra phrases the Cloud People love. “Collective commitment” is
one of my favorites. Cloud People love that phrase. Pol Pot was fond of
that phrase too. The Cloud People never shut up about the glories of
unity and collective action, while at the same time yapping about
diversity and tolerance. <a

target="_blank">Mussolini would be proud</a>.

Similarly, the “values of equality, diversity, inclusion and
non-discrimination” are not values anyone in the Cloud actually follows,
but they like the way it sounds so they say it a lot. Show up at a
faculty meeting with a Trump hat on and these people will run screaming
for security. You will be arrested and thrown in a pit, all in the name
of tolerance and inclusion. The words no longer have a literal meaning
for the Cloud People. They are magic words and the point of using them
is make you shut-up so they can boss you around without having to
explain themselves.

The insanity of this is not in the fact they are on the side of mentally
ill men in dresses stalking little girls in public toilets. That’s
crazy, but what’s really nuts is the fact they think this appeals to the
general public. “I support men in dresses watching my daughter pee” is
something said by exactly no one ever. Dirt People feel sorry for
transvestites and would support mental health services for them. Normal
people would be against throwing trannies off rooftops, as is preferred
by the Muslims the Cloud People are importing.

Otherwise, it is an ugly part of the human condition that normal people
tend to ignore. If the man down the street likes to wear something
pretty, that’s his business as long as it remains just his business. If
he goes outside like that, he better be extremely respectful of the rest
of us. The same is true of swingers and other fetishes like
<a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2001/03/furries200103"
target="_blank">furries</a>. Normal people have always understood that
privacy must be respect and publicity should always be used carefully.
Keep your private affairs private and respect the privacy of others.

It is just another example of the great gulf that lies between the
rulers and those over whom they rule. Not so long ago, the rulers would
have known this and showed their goodness by defending the little girl
from the deranged man in the sundress. They may not have done much about
it, other than make a speech, but they would have made the effort to
show they are on the side of angels, with regards to men in sundresses
stalking children in toilets. The North Carolina law is perfect example
of this practice.

Today, they expect the fathers and mothers of those little girls to
cheer them for unleashing perverts onto the public. It is the worst sort
of grace on the cheap, because it inflicts a heavy cost on the public.
The Cloud People ruthlessly enforce their codes of conduct in their
world,, while denying normal people the right to do the same. One can be
forgiven for thinking that maybe there is a sadistic pleasure at work.
The Cloud People humor themselves by immiserating their subjects.

Again, it is easy to see why Mao sent these people to the rice paddies.
