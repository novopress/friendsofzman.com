In the movie The Godfather, there’s a scene where Don Corleone is giving
Michael some advice about life. He says, “I spent my whole life trying
not to be careless. Women and children can afford to be careless, but
not men.” It’s a great line and it was true for most of human existence.
The role of males in society has always exposed them to the greater
risk. That and male competition has often been for keeps. When the
stakes are high the room for error is smaller so men have always had to
be the less reckless of the sexes.

We live in a soft age where women run most things so that means we live
in a careless age as well. All sorts of silly and ridiculous things are
indulged because the margin for error seems endless. You can make up a
bunch of silly diversity rules, for example, on the college campus,
because little serious work is done on the college campus. Most of what
is done is busy work. In the areas where serious work is done, like the
hard sciences, you see very little of the PC nonsense we associate with
the academy.

That’s a pretty good measure to keep in mind. In any area where you see
lots of PC jaclassery, you can be sure that most of the work is
unimportant. Of course, the opposite is true as well. In Silicon Valley,
for example, work has to get done and the work is challenging, so they
don’t waste a ton of time on counting colors and vaginas in the work
force. <a

The people running Facebook need real work to get done and get done
quickly. That means hiring the best people they can find. They don’t
have a lot of time to indulge the diversity nonsense so they don’t. If
they filled their cubicles with a rainbow of diversity hires, the PC
Puritans would love them, but their share holders and users would not.
Since the latter pay the bills, Facebook can live with some bad press.
Zuckerberg will just donate another billion dollars to some Progressive
cause.

That leads to another rule. When a company that appears to doing real
work hires a powerskirt to bring diversity to the firm, it means the
insiders have cashed out and no longer think the firm is a good bet.
Yahoo made that clear when they hired Marrisa Mayer to diversify the
company. <a

target="_blank">She immediately went berserk and started firing men</a>
and turning the place into an estrogen circus. This was possible because
the smart money had left and they could afford to indulge in some PC
jackassery.

That’s the thing about modern liberalism. Identity politics cannot
survive contact with reality. That’s because it is the ultimate luxury
item. It can be indulged only where the consequences are of no
consequence. The Federal government can have a workforce that ticks all
the boxes on the diversity scorecard, because no one actually wants the
government to do anything. Having a collection of incompetent people at
a government agency goes unnoticed so they can fill it up with diversity
hires.

While the futurists promise us a future where all the required work is
done by AI robots, so we can enjoy the long overdue flying cars and
jet-packs, that’s not now. In the present, the hard work of keeping
society going still needs to be done by competent people. Ask anyone who
hires for a living and they will tell you that the demand for competence
outstrips the supply in just about every field. That means wherever real
work gets done, diversity can never be a top priority, so it will not be
a top priority.

Reality. It is the thing that does not go away when you stop believing
in it.
