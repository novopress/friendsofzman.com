For about six months, starting last winter, Western media talked about a
Ukrainian counter-offensive that was supposed to change the direction of
the war. These stories coincided with stories about the delivery of
various types of equipment, along with expert opinions from retired
generals. Late in the spring Washington sent reliable <a
href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2023/05/30/ukraines-counteroffensive-plan-impressive-sen-graham-says-00099230"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">toadies</a> over to Kiev to see the plans
and then talk to the media about how the Ukrainians were preparing to
deal a death blow to Moscow.

As we get into the heart of August and the third month of the offensive,
it is clear to most everyone that it has been a <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/08/politics/ukraine-counteroffensive-us-briefings/index.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">disaster</a>. First came the images of
Western armored vehicles trapped in minefields. Images of burning tanks
were then followed by video of Ukrainian soldiers struggling to escape
the same minefields after their armored vehicles were disabled by mines.
Then came weeks of reports in the West about revised tactics that
achieved nothing along the front.

As things stand, the most enthusiastic Ukraine supporters say that the
counter-offensive has managed to capture about ten square miles. In
reality, the Ukrainians failed to make it through the security zone of
Russian defenses. This is the area in front of the first defensive lines
that are used to slow an attack. In the south, Ukraine managed to
capture a few abandoned villages, but relentless Russian attacks from
artillery and airpower turned those into Ukrainian cemeteries.

At the start of the offensive, independent observers and Russian sources
said the Ukrainians had enough resources to continue their offensive
into August. At that point they will have exhausted men and material. At
that point, they would have no choice but to stop offensive operations
and fall back into defensive positions. Otherwise, they would be forced
to cannibalize their lines and leave themselves open to Russian attacks
in other areas along the line of contact.

That may have been a generous assessment. Over the last couple of weeks
Russian forces in the north have steadily
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNqpyi7KP1U" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">pushed</a> the Ukrainians back. Ukraine has just moved
their northern headquarters west to get clear of the Russian advance.
They have also ordered the evacuation of Kupyansk, an important town
located on the bank of the Oskil River in the Kharkiv Oblast. Reports
suggest the Ukrainians simply lack the manpower and equipment to defend
the area.

Washington is in a panic because they promised everyone that the
Ukrainians would easily smash through Russian lines in the south. The
plan was to rush through to the Sea of Azov, thus severing the land
bridge between Russia and Crimea. Once that happened, attacks would
begin on Crimea. The Russian army would either revolt after the
humiliation or simply collapse, causing political chao in Moscow. It is
hard to believe, but this was the official narrative.

Interestingly, the narrative was not just another pack of lies from the
Kagan cult, but an official assessment from the Pentagon. It has been
Western military doctrine that the way to defeat the Russians in a land
war is with a rapid, concentrated attack on their defensive lines using
armor and infantry. Here is a <a
href="https://www.moore.army.mil/armor/earmor/content/issues/2017/spring/2Fiore17.pdf"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">paper</a> on the topic from 2017 and here
is a recent
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo3PfWYsDVA" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">video</a> discussing it in connection with this war.
This strategy actually goes back to the Cold War days.

The short version is that Russia organized its army around groups of 800
to 1000 men that operate independently within the defensive formation.
These units have, tanks armored personnel carriers and artillery. The
NATO strategy was to send overwhelming force at these units, forcing
them to retreat in order to preserve their equipment. Russia is known
for trading land for resources. They did this in the Kharkiv region last
year and in the Kherson region last spring.

What Washington did not notice is that the Russians have moved away from
the Battalion Tactical Group to more flexible arrangements based on the
situation, terrain, and their own resources. In the south when Ukraine
launched its main attack, they did not face battalions, but divisions.
Further, the Russians had prepared complex defensive positions designed
to trap advancing armored columns. In other words, the Russians read
that paper and were ready for it.

Another thing Washington did not notice is that the Russian army has
changed in other ways since the Cold War. They have a wide range of
electronic warfare systems that work well against modern weapons. They
also have incorporated drones in massive numbers that are highly
effective against Western armor. The internet is full of videos where a
Lancet drone takes out a Ukrainian armored vehicle. The Russians have
quickly become the masters of drone warfare.

The main reason the Ukrainian offensive is a catastrophe is the side
with the trillion-dollar annual budget has not updated their
understanding of the Russian army since the last century. They have not
bothered to notice what has been happening on the battlefields over the
last eighteen months. Instead, the world’s most expensive military has
gone along with the crackpot plans of the Kagan cult, either not
understanding what is happening or indifferent to the inevitable
results.

The Ukraine war is becoming a microcosm of the crisis of competence. It
is not just the scarcity of talented people in the ranks. They still
exist in sufficient numbers to keep the system operating reasonably
well. The issue is the selection pressure at the top is for true
believers and sycophants. The only way to get in the room to discuss the
Ukraine war is to be fully on board with the dream of destroying Russia
or be willing to humiliate yourself by telling these people what they
want to hear.

Imagine the tag team of Victoria Nuland and General Milley replicated
throughout the managerial system. Nuland is the maniacal imbecile in
charge for no other reason than zealotry, while Milley is the oleaginous
flunky with the credentials to provide legitimacy to the rantings of
Nuland. The competent are driven from the room, leaving this combination
to chart public policy. The general decline in competence that is
driving <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/08/gen-z-americans-white-majority-study"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">demographics</a>, is driven by this
combination at the top.

In the movie Braveheart, Longshanks returns from France to
<a href="https://youtu.be/4S7QARslq74" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">confront</a> his son who was charged with putting down
the Scottish revolt. His son has his “advisor” with him, who makes the
mistake of speaking out of turn. This is what has happened in the West,
except Longshanks died of a heart attack and his son is in charge. The
advisor now busies himself telling the son what he wants to hear.
Meanwhile, outside the castle walls, the kingdom rattles toward
collapse.
