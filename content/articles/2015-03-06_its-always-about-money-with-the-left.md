I’m fond of pointing out that the Left has a strange and predictable
opposite rule of rhetoric. Whatever they are accusing the bogeyman of
doing, you can almost always be sure it is the exact opposite of the
truth. In almost all cases, the thing they are accusing the bogeyman of
doing is what they are currently doing. It is a wonderful bit of
deception and a great group adaptation. While the non-believers are
examining the bogeyman’s actions, the Left gets to operate unfettered.
Shifting the focus is one of those individual traits that scales up very
well.

So it is with the Left and foreign policy. They are always accusing the
neo-cons or the plain old regular cons of trading blood for something,
like oil. Iraq was allegedly about oil. Afghanistan was about
Halliburton and the defense industry. A lot of time was spent examining
these claims only to learn that it was ideology and sloppy reasoning,
not money, at the root of these adventures. The Bush people really
thought they were spreading democracy.

The Cuba deal, on the other hand, was a pure money play. Obama’s money
men see opportunity in Cuba. It may be a poor country, but it can be a
resort colony, medical colony for health care tourists and a source of
cheap labor. To the average America, Cuba is a wart on the face of
humanity and should be allowed to sink into the sea. In other words, the
Right is motivated by morality, while for the Left, Cuba is just another
place to feed.

The pending Iran deal is similarly about money. The usual suspects on
the professional Right are trying to make it about Obama the Muslim or
Obama the Jew-hater. Obama is most certainly pro-Muslim and he hates
Jews, but that’s not what it is about. It is about money. I have a
friend in the region who works in the oil and gas sector. He reports
that American firms are sending top level delegations to Tehran in
anticipation of a deal. The head of
<a href="http://www.cevalogistics.com/en-US/Pages/default.aspx"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ceva Logistics</a> was just in Iran
trying to cut a deal. They are a prime for Halliburton and Schlumberger.

The American Left is not Marxist. That strain died out in the 50’s. As
David Horowitz has explained in great detail, the modern Left rejected
the old commies early on as has-beens and opportunists. The modern
American Left is very comfortable with global capitalism. They made
their peace with it in the late 80’s and have since evolved into a
movement Mussolini would easily recognize and envy. In some respects,
the Clintons get away with their shenanigans because their coevals envy
their prowess. Obama and the Wookiee hope to follow their model and
become super-rich after his term in office is complete.

This sort of cynical self-dealing has its limits. In the banana
republics, it usually ends in a bloodbath. In a nuclear world, a
bloodbath is a good result. Sane people who follow Iran think the rulers
truly believe their rhetoric. The Iranian mullahs think they are
ushering in the end times and they will be triumphant in the final great
clash. Maybe they don’t. Maybe they just say all that stuff because they
think they have to keep up appearances, like American politicians
wearing flag lapel pins. No one can know, but it is a big risk for a
little cash.
