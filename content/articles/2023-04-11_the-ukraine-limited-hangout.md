Last week, the New York Times broke a
<a href="https://archive.is/jaKGm" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">story</a> about allegedly leaked documents from Western
sources circulating on the internet. Since late January, images of what
looks like briefing documents have been turning up on various sites. In
March, a trove of them turned up on Discord and then another batch soon
after. These documents focus primarily on the Ukraine war, but cover
other issues as well, like spying on various governments and plans for
war with China.

This comes at a critical time, as the war in the Ukraine seems to be
reaching an inflexion point militarily and politically. The Russians are
about to crack the Zelensky line by taking Bakhmut. This will force the
Ukrainians to move further west into the last defensive lines in the
Donbas. Politically, patience is beginning to run out in Europe as the
war drags far past the promised end date. Washington promised regime
change in Moscow and instead it is happening in European capitals.

There is also the endless chatter from Washington about a spring
offensive by Ukraine that promises to retake the Donbas. Every day
someone from the administration or one of their proxies tells the media
about the spring offensive. These documents seem to confirm that NATO
has been planning an offensive for months. They list troop numbers for
new battalions, as well as equipment deliveries. The most publicized
military operation in history is now getting more publicity.

That is the first red flag with the document leak. These documents
confirm many of the public statements made by various officials. It is
as if they felt that no one believed them, so they leaked this stuff
on-line. The fact that “sources” have rushed to their favorite
regime-aligned media to confirm the authenticity also suggests this is a
bit too convenient of a leak. Normally, there is no comment about these
sorts of leaks, to avoid revealing additional information.

Of course, that brings up the second red flag. The four people
“reporting” the story for the New York Times are well known conduits for
regime propaganda. Gibbons-Neff is most likely an intelligence agent,
given his resume. Schmitt has ties to the Kagan cult and has a long
association with the State Department. Over the last year, every story
from these four reads like a press release from the administration.
Their job is to push regime narratives and disinformation campaigns.

Another red flag is the comingling of disparate information.
Compartmentalization is the foundation of state security. This means
segregating information into discrete domains, which is the basis for a
need-to-know information flow. Some people need to know about
battlefield data, for example, while other people need to know about the
political situation, but not necessarily the battlefield information.
Only senior people will need to know both data sets.

Now, it is possible that these documents are from a range of briefing
books, but that would mean they are from a senior official. Think about
the sort of people who need data on Ukraine, the looming war in Asia,
the current war in the Middle East and the current state of spying on
friendly governments. Unless the leaker is General Milley, the breadth
of subjects in these documents suggests they may be part of a
disinformation campaign of some sort.

That brings up another red flag. If you want to trick someone into
believing your story, you seed the story with facts that they can
confirm. When presented with confirmed information and unconfirmed
information in support of a narrative, humans are likely to accept the
narrative. If the confirmed information is not generally available, then
the bias in favor of the narrative is stronger. In other words, you put
your poison fruit in a basket of wholesome and pleasing fruit.

You see that in this document leak. Mixed in with plans for taking the
Crimea is data about casualties and supplies that you do not see in the
media. This is the sort of stuff the Russians could confirm, as they
surely know the condition of the Ukrainian army and their casualty
numbers. The intel on Ukrainian air defenses is another bit of truth
that makes the leak story look plausible. This data gives away nothing
but adds authenticity to the other data in the documents.

Now, Hanlon’s razor applies here. It is not as if the people running
Ukraine policy for the regime are the best and the brightest. All these
red flags could be explained away as incompetence by the regime. In
fact, the leaker could simply be trying to get this reality out into the
open. There are plenty of skeptics on the military side of the regime
who could be leaking this to embarrass the neocons. It is impossible to
know, but skepticism is always the prudent course.

The question behind this is why would the regime do a limited hangout
like this on the eve of the big spring offensive? Surely, they know the
Russians have their own intelligence operations. That means they know
what Ukraine is planning. The Russians have satellites too, so they can
see where Ukraine is mustering forces. In other words, this sort of
operation is not going to trick the Russians. If this operation is not
aimed at the Russians, then who is the target?

The logical answer is European politicians. The bits of tasty fruit in
these documents stroke the European ego. It makes their American masters
look crude and amateurish, not like the suave and sophisticated
Europeans. By playing to their vanity this way, they are more likely to
buy the narrative of a great Ukrainian offensive. These documents tell
them that they need to wait just a little while longer and they will be
rewarded with a smashing success on the battlefield.

Alternatively, this may be prep work for the political fallout that will
surely come when the Ukraine war turns ugly later this year. Sending
Marco Rubio out to <a
href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2023/04/09/marco-rubio-slams-french-presidents-call-break-away-us-does-macron-speak-europe/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">trash</a> French President Emmanuel
Macron could be the start of a campaign to shift blame for the failures
of Ukraine to the Europeans. Conservatives can then focus their ire on
the French, rather than the neocons. You see? Those duplicitous French
have undermined our Ukraine policies. Freedom fries are back!

Since the key to regime power is control of information, we are left to
guess as to why these allegedly secret documents are on the internet.
Stupidity is always a good option, but that cuts in many ways. Stupid
people do not lack agency. They do things for a reason, but their
reasons are stupid. That may be the case here. It could also be part of
some larger narrative developing for later this year. After all, these
people are also evil and evil people think this way.
