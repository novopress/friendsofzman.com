In the history of motoring, no owner of a sports car has ever said,
“This car would be perfect if it sounded like a washing machine instead
of a sports car.” In fact, a common complaint from sports car
enthusiasts over the decades is that their favorite model does not have
a sexy enough exhaust note. A big part of owning a sports car, even a
budget model, is the sound it makes when driving. Watch a car show or
YouTube car channel and exhaust sound is always mentioned.

Even if you are not into sports cars, the sound of the engine revving is
something everyone associates with a sports car. The sound of the car
shifting gears, the echo of the exhaust in a narrow canyon, is a big
part of the experience. Similarly, driving enthusiasts prefer manual
gearboxes to automatics, even though they will tell you that computer
controlled automatic transmissions are far superior. The manual gearbox
allows the driver to feel like he is part of the machine.

With that in mind, the world’s premiere sports car makers are promising
to take all of that away in the coming years. They say they will stop
building internal combustion engines and go completely electric. Most
have already abandoned manual gearboxes and the rest promise to do so
shortly. The supercar makers are investing all of their time in electric
motors and self-driving technology. Their goal is to make the elite
sports car into something close to an autonomous vehicle

That means the sports car driving experience will soon be like sitting
in front of your laptop to the sound of kitchen appliances. Car shows
will have soft looking men and women climbing into futuristic vehicles
then sitting there in silence as the vehicle goes about the business of
being a car. Presumably, the sports models will come with a VR system so
the driver can pretend to be driving an actual sports car or maybe it
will just have a screen to see what it used to be like.

The question is why? Again, no one can find a Ferrari owner saying he
wishes his supercar sounded more like the kitchen juicer. No one has
ever daydreamed about driving his blender through the countryside.
People into motoring do it for how it makes them feel and it makes them
feel alive. It reminds them that life is for living, not ticking boxes
on a spreadsheet dreamed up by a sadist with a graduate degree. That’s
the thrill of driving a fast car to your limit.

Granted, there is a group of people who claim to be sports car
enthusiasts who think electric sports cars are a great idea. They like
telling people that electric cars have a flat torque curve, meaning they
can accelerate faster than a normal car. BMW has made a lot of money
selling them Z-series sports cars, the ones that look like a clown’s
shoe, because these are people who are dead inside. Their enthusiasm for
sports cars is superficial and performative.

Of course, there is the environmental angle. The Gaia worshippers claim
that electric cars are better for Mother Earth. These are the people who
tote their groceries home from the market in grimy canvas sacks. These
are the people who wear ornamental face gear thinking it wards off evil
spirits. The people who have made a childish fear of the bogeyman into
both a science and a religion love electric cars. They also think
everyone should live in pods and ride the bus.

Putting aside their superstitions, electric cars are not eco-friendly or
a more efficient use of natural resources. Electric comes from power
stations. The most common powerplant fuels are coal, natural gas, and
uranium. In the United States, only 20% of electricity comes from
so-called renewables like solar. These “good” sources of electric like
solar are a blight on nature and environmentally toxic. The long term
costs far outweigh the costs of conventional energy production systems.

Then there is the practicality of electric cars. Fueling a normal car
takes a few minutes while charging an EV takes hours. Again, no one is
sitting around saying, “I’d like to spend hours at a roadside station
talking with people who tend to loiter at rest stops while my electric
car is being charged.” Then there is the fact that you have to install a
charging station in your home. Imagine buying a car and being told you
have to install a filling station in your backyard in order to use it.

In other words, the natural demand for electric cars was zero and
remains low even with the push to manufacture demand. There is a novelty
factor, for sure, but if no one had bothered to push the production of
electric cars, they would not exist. Tesla exists as a way for Elon Musk
to hoover up billions in government money, not because he found an
unexploited niche in the automobile market. What he found was a clever
way to become a rent seeker and the P.T. Barnum of the technological
age.

It would be easy to go through all of the arguments in favor of electric
cars and show them to be ridiculous or plain wrong. That is not the
point. The point is despite the obvious, Western elites are hell bent on
forcing us into electric cars. Those super car makers are not marketing
to the hoi polloi. They cater to the global elite and they think the
global elite believes in the miracle of electric cars. They are catering
to their audience and their audience is our ruling class.

The point of this exercise is not to argue against electric cars, but to
point out that practicality and self-interest are not what motivates the
ruling class. All of them mouth the platitudes of Gaia worship because
that is the prevailing orthodoxy. It is a way for them to signal their
adherence to the faith. The local officials installing charging stations
at the local school, yet ignoring the broken pipes and boarded up
windows, are not thinking practically or responding to the demands of
the people.

The electric car grift is useful in thinking about how partisanship in a
liberal democracy becomes ideology then something closer to theology.
The old partisan divide of the last century, good whites versus bad
whites, has become a basket of beliefs untethered from practical
reality. That basket of beliefs now forms a religion that bounds and
defines the ruling class. The managerial class now has its own religion
to control and define the members.
