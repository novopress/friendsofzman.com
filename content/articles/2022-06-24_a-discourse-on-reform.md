The show will go on hiatus for a week, so this is a two hour program to
make up for the loss of an hour next week. Since we are officially in
summer, something I wanted to do, but have not found a way to do it, is
plug some books from our side that people may find useful on the summer
holiday at the beach. I do not do many book reviews, but I get a lot of
requests for them, along with book suggestions.

For the fictionally inclined, three books by two authors from our side
have been recommended to me. Karl Dahl’s *Faction* is a
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Faction-Karl-Dahl/dp/1082596450/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">crime novel</a> released last year and
another episode is coming out soon. Spencer J. Quinn, who turns up in
the comments here and writes for Counter-Currents has sent me two of his
books. <a
href="https://www.booksamillion.com/p/White-Like/Spencer-J-Quinn/9781940933740"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">One</a> is *White Like You* and the <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Charitys-Blade-Spencer-J-Quinn/dp/9187339803"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">other</a> is *Charity’s Blade*.

Old friend Joseph Cotto has a <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Eye-Liberty-Murder-Pursuit-Revenge-at-ebook/dp/B0B2RHL4ZJ/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">book</a> out about the history of
Florida. This focuses on the French settlements and what happened to
them. It is a bit of forgotten history that there was a French
settlement in Florida. It is fair to say that the history of the state
and of the country would be much different if the French had done a
better job managing their colonies in the New World. Counter-Currents
has reviewed it
<a href="https://counter-currents.com/2022/06/when-florida-was-french/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.

While on the topic of friends of the show, I did a <a
href="https://amgreatness.com/2022/02/26/a-movement-that-must-invent-its-enemies-to-exist/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">review</a> of Paul Gottfried’s <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Antifascism-Course-Crusade-Paul-Gottfried-ebook/dp/B08YXF4V7F/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest book</a> for American Greatness a
few months back. Given that the Left is now promising another summer of
rage, some may be inclined to study up on the history. *Antifascism: The
Course of a Crusade *is a short read about the surprisingly long history
of anti-fascism in the West. It is a good companion to his <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X1NK37C/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i6"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">book</a> on fascism.

Finally, I recently read Kevin MacDonald’s <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Individualism-Western-Liberal-Tradition-Evolutionary/dp/1089691483"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">book</a> *Individualism and the Western
Liberal Tradition* and I have to say it is an odd book. I was planning
to do a review, so I did a close reading, taking lots of notes, but even
after thinking about it for a while I am still not sure what to make of
it. I did not hate it, but I did find it a bit frustrating because of
how it is organized. It could just be a matter of taste.

In case anyone is interested, I am currently re-reading Burnham’s *The
Managerial Revolution* for my own book project. My copy comes with the
essay by George Orwell titled, *Second Thoughts on James Burnham*. The
essay is a critique of Burnham’s often ridiculous claims during the war
and the failure of his theory from a socialist perspective, which itself
is an interesting reminder of Orwell’s own limitations.
