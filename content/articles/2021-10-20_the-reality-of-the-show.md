If a man had fallen asleep in 1980 and woke up in this age, he would be
amazed at many things. We can easily think of the technological stuff
like social media, Zoom calls and mobile devices. Then you have the
cynical stull like the failure get back to the moon, much less Mars. One
less obvious change is the explosion of entertainment and the public
obsession with being entertained. Forty years ago, people did not expect
to be constantly entertained throughout their day.

One aspect of the saturation of entertainment is how public affairs
transformed into something like Vaudeville. People dream up new acts and
new characters to play on-line and on television. If the act works, we
get a flood of imitators. Once that runs its course, someone cooks up a
new way to separate from the rest of the performers and they have their
run on the big stage. Politics in this age is pure theater, centered on
various acts making claims to certain audiences.

Unlike jugglers or sword swallowers, political theater is not
transactional. In the conventional form, entertainment is about the
performer getting your attention, which causes you to pay to see their
act. There is no connection between the audience and the performer,
beyond the implicit agreement that he will do his best to entertain you
and you will applaud when he does. In political theater, you are
supposed to care about the performer and do what you can to boost his
career.

This <a
href="https://amgreatness.com/2021/10/18/the-stupid-money-on-the-right-rides-the-grift-train"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> over at American Greatness gets
at this odd nature of political entertainment with regards to
Conservative Inc.. The post is a takeoff on something Michael Anton
<a href="https://youtu.be/T6zY1lSqgcU" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">said</a> about the conservative rackets. Wealthy people
lavish conservative rackets with cash, despite the fact they accomplish
nothing. In fact, it is fair to say that Conservative Inc. is just an
enabler of the things they pretend to oppose. In other words, they lose
on purpose, and they know they are losing on purpose.

The post goes on to talk about how easily conservative donors are duped
by people like Jonah Goldberg or Ramesh Ponnuru into handing over cash.
National Review just raised $100,000 on-line despite having no audience
outside the institutions of Conservative Inc. and even that is
debatable. The Bulwark and Dispatch have billionaire support even though
they have no audience. Why is it that smart people with money are easily
fooled by these hustlers?

One reason is the nature of political entertainment. When you watch a
movie or television show, it is a passive act. There is a clear divide
between you and the performers on stage. In political theater, each
member of the audience is drawn into the act, feeling like they have an
impact on the performance. Even when it is not interactive, the person
watching tends to feel like his caring about what he sees and hears can
change what is happening in the show.

Jonah Goldberg is a useful example in that he is one of the more
successful political entertainers of this age. He is also a creature of
the new political entertainment that emerged in the 1990’s with the
widescale adoption of the internet. He started out fetching coffee for
the far-left extremist Ben Wattenberg, who had a long running show on
state television. In prior times, this would have been about as far as
Goldberg would go in the realm of current events programming.

Instead, he landed the role of internet slacker for National Review’s
new on-line venture that was aimed at a younger and hipper crowd.
Goldberg’s role required him to blend official dogma with snarky pop
culture references. Early in his role, he often made jokes about his
slacker lifestyle. He invited readers to e-mail him, and he would often
post about the exchanges. Later, comments were added to the site, and he
would respond to them from time to time.

Goldberg got famous and very rich despite being as dumb as a goldfish
and peddling boilerplate neoconservatism. The reason for this is his
fans felt like they were a part of his act and there were having an
impact on what he was saying. Despite the fact that he and his neocon
cronies have slithered back to the Left, many of his fans still follow
him at his new venture. In other words, even after it is clear that
Goldberg would happily gas his readership, many remain engaged with him.

The main result of the relationship between political performers and
their marks is that they are able to transfer their interests onto the
audience. That is, the audience for this stuff cares about things that
are good for the guys who they follow. The donors who get to have dinner
with the team at the Dispatch are not thinking about the issues being
promoted so much as the people promoting them. They feel like they are
part of the show and have some input on the performance.

Conservative Inc. is a long sophisticated confidence game. It was not
always this way, but it evolved into a racket in the 1990’s. It
coincides with the explosion of mass media and the emerging
entertainment culture. Going back to the Rip Van Winkle at the start of
this post, he would be baffled by how people identify themselves by the
types of entertainment they consume. Putting your sports teams in your
social media profile would seem bizarre to a man from the 1980’s.

This is something Ryszard Legutko noted in his excellent
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0742HPXCS/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">book</a>, *The Demon in Democracy: Totalitarian
Temptations in Free Societies*. Legutko is a polish politician who was
involved in the Solidarity Movement. Among many excellent observations,
he notes the lack of seriousness in liberal democratic politics.
Everyone is consumed with leisure and being entertained. Adults are
encouraged to act like children, even in areas like politics which
should be the domain of the sober minded.

In this light, the boiling off of serious political actors from the
large public stages is perfectly rational. The serious critics of the
war machine, for example, may be correct in their observations, but they
get marginalized because they do not offer the larger audience the thing
they crave. They are the party poopers who yell at the people at the
party for not caring about some cause. Worse yet, they remind adults
that they are acting like children, so they are shunned.

The same can be said for the fringe on the other side. Immigration
patriots are not littering their commentary with pop culture references.
They are not flattering their audience with the promise that if they
care enough, the ending of the show will be just as they imagined.
Instead, they warn about demographic collapse and that is just a total
downer, and no one wants to hear it. The most hated man is the serious
person in a room full of silly people looking for a good time.

What this suggests is that outsiders have two choices. One is to put on
the grease paint and get out there and please the crowd. The people
demanding Medicare for all need to make it fun to care about such
things. The Straussian critics of conservatism have to put on a better
show, out-clown people like David French. Otherwise, the alternative is
to work the small stage waiting for when the times need serious men and
the people in charge are not up for the task.

Those are not pleasant options, but adults are supposed to accept that
often the choices are not very good. Serious people know that the best
you can do sometimes is play a bad hand so you can play the next hand.
They are also supposed to know that society is a big complicated thing
and you cannot easily alter it. often, you just have to let things play
out and prepare for it. The antidote to frivolity is not more frivolity
but a sober-minded acceptance of reality, no matter how unpopular.
