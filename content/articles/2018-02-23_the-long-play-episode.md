This week’s show is T-rated. That means it covers taboo subjects that
may not be appropriate for all audiences. Listener discretion advised.
That means I’m tackling one of the most taboo subjects in our age and
that is the JQ. Specifically, I’m breaking down the alt-right argument
with regards to Jews in America. Since I want to be fair and it is a big
subject, this episode is twice the normal length. Think of it like a
double album.

The reason for getting into this is a debate I saw between Mike Enoch of
<a href="https://therightstuff.biz/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The
Right Stuff</a> and a person calling himself
<a href="https://www.halseynews.com/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Halsey English</a>. The
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzE9vfiLU9Q" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">debate</a> itself was terrible, but it got me thinking
about the arguments these guys make about Jews and white identity. In
fairness to them, I had never seriously thought about their arguments,
so I thought I should and that’s why it is in this week’s podcast. I
look forward to correction if I made any mistakes.

This week I have the usual variety of items not in the now standard
format. Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the
Android commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I
am on iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their
Hitler phones. Of course, the Hitler Phones are so slow now, you may
never finish. YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a
download link below.
