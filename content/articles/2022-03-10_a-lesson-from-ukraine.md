One of the underlying plot lines of the conflict in Ukraine is the role
nationalism has played and in playing in the conflict. Fundamentally,
the West, especially the United States, is responding to the purest of
nationalist calls. The response to Ukrainian patriotism is an
endorsement of the basic tenets of nationalism. The Ukrainians are a
unique people with a common language, culture and territory. Therefore,
they have a right to their own nation.

Conveniently left out of American coverage is the fact that
ultra-nationalists have been playing a key role in the drama. These are
the militia groups that have a fondness for fascist ideas and
iconography. The most famous example is the Azov Battalion, but they are
just one of many operating in Ukraine. These groups have been doing the
fighting in the breakaway republics. This was true when the Ukrainians
were assaulting the areas and now that the Russians have invaded.

Of course, the West is now organized around opposition to nationalism,
especially the form expressed by the Ukrainian ultra-nationalists. In
every country in Europe, nationalist groups have top meet in secret to
avoid the wrath of state sponsored terrorist groups like Antifa. In
Germany, nationalism is illegal as a practical matter. A party that
sounds too nationalistic, like the AfD, will be crushed by the state. In
theory, Ukraine is what the rest of Europe opposes.

Then there is the reality of Russian nationalism. The Western media is
painting it as the new fascism, but this is another example of the
antifascist legacy. Russian nationalism is now a mirror of Europeanism.
Listen to Putin and what you hear is a call for pan-Slavism or
Eurasianism, to use a Dugan term. Instead of a unified Western Europe it
is federation of Eurasian people with the Russians leading the way. It
is the EU for people with no natural place in the EU.

There is another aspect to the Russian side that the nationalists have
thus far struggled to accept or even understand. What Russia is arguing
for is an older, more realistic form of nationalism that is based on
blood and history. Putin talks about the long history and shared
suffering of the Russian and Ukrainian people. It is a call to
solidarity that transcends the whims of map makers. The modern dissident
nationalist is mainly focused on maps and objections to globalism.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has put the dissident nationalists in a
crisis, because it is placing them on the wrong side of history and the
wrong side of the present. All of a sudden, nationalists are standing
shoulder to shoulder with the people they know are the enemies of
nationalism. It is turning out that modern nationalism is more of a pose
than a well-considered political morality. They have been left with the
same silly flag waving that we see from actors in the news media.

It is not an accident that many of the people who fly the nationalist
flag were all wrong about the Covid response. Nationalism, in the modern
sense, is nothing more than warmed over cartoon fascism. The modern
nationalist dreams of wearing snappy uniforms and being at the top of
the status hierarchy. He is fully engaged in opposition to the
prevailing cosmopolitan globalism, but he has no agenda of his own,
other than opposition to the polices of globalism.

This is not to say that nationalism is a bad thing, especially in the
way the modern ruling elite describes it. Nor does it mean that the
nation state is a failed idea. What the crisis in Ukraine reveals is
that modern nationalism is simply not ready to be anything more than a
holding pen for the disaffected. Nationalists in Europe need to
understand that no one in the European elite is shedding any tears for
what is now happening to the ultra-nationalist at the hands of the
Russian military.

What the Ukrainian disaster provides is an opportunity for nationalists
to regroup and plot a course that acknowledges present and future
reality. The Global American Empire is fading and we see that in Europe
now. What comes next is open for debate and if nationalists are to be a
part of that debate, they have to have a positive agenda, rather than a
list of complaints about American globalism. Nationalism needs to offer
a way forward in the post-America Europe.

The place for them to start is Ukraine. Nationalism needs to explain why
the Zelensky government violated its duty to the people by picking a
fight with Russia. It also has to explain why Ukrainian patriots are
right to defend their country, even if their government is a corrupt
puppet regime of another power. In other words, nationalist need to fuse
their theory with practical politics. Political theory is a fine thing
but it is worthless if it cannot solve the practical problems of human
organization.

The Ukraine disaster should be a lesson to American nationalists,
especially the pro-white variety. The cultural, biological and
linguistic differences between Russians and Ukrainians are small,
certainly not worth fighting over. That is the theory, but the reality
is the bombed out schools and dead soldiers. America is a big diverse
place with differences that dwarf the differences between Russians and
Ukrainians. Uniting any group in America is a gargantuan task.

For any form of nationalism to work in America, as it descends into
majority-minority demographics, it must respect the vast regional
differences. Simplistic calls to demographic reality will work no better
than the simplistic calls to nationalism have worked in Ukraine. Laundry
lists of complaints about the present or the past are not a viable
agenda. Whatever comes next for America will have to be rooted in a
positive agenda that promotes a future that inspires the target
population.

Finally, what the Ukraine disaster shows is that the old categories and
the old ways of speaking of politics no longer work. The
ultranationalist are not Nazis, despite their adoption of some Nazi
iconography. Putin is certainly not Hitler. There are no white hats and
no black hats. The simplistic world of the past where everyone had a
convenient role to play is over. In the post-American Empire, we will
need not only new labels, but a new political morality to go with it.
