When you start doing something like a podcast, you quickly discover that
there is a whole new world of technical skills that you have taken for
granted. Audio engineering has been around since the dawn of radio, but
no one thinks much about it. We just expect radio to sound a certain way
and audio for TV and movies to sound a certain way. Probably the closest
we come to thinking about it is when setting up a home theater or adding
a sub-woofer to the sound system. Otherwise, there is no reason to think
about it.

Start doing a podcast and you are suddenly made aware of this hidden
world. One of the things on my 2019 list is to learn more about this
dark art, to make the show sound better and more professional. I just
acquired some new gear this week and this is the first show applying
some new skills. Removing background noise or “room sound” is something
I have added to the skillset. I also got better at removing those little
breaths you can sometimes hear as I am reading something from a news
story of post.

Doing the editing with quality headphones was a learning experience.
When I did that, I realized that the final product sounds a lot
different to what comes from the speakers on my computer. They say
headphones give a better sound quality, but I have never liked listening
to anything through headphones. It is why I use bone induction headsets
for travel. Most people probably consume podcasts through headphones, so
I figure I should optimize the sound for that way of listening to audio.

Another thing I have learned by listening through headphones is the
stinger, that little explosion sound at the end of segments, sounds
terrible. Through speakers, it sounds fine, but through headphones it is
awful. This weekend I will be auditioning new stinger clips for the
show. Since the software I use allows for the creation of sound effects,
I will use this as an opportunity to figure out how that works. There’s
free stuff on YouTube, but not all of it is high quality. I can figure
out how to make my own sounds this way.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I have been
de-platformed by Spotify, because they feared I was poisoning the minds
of their Millennial customers.
