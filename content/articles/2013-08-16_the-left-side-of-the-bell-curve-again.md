Given the tiny audience I have at this stage of my blogging career, I’m
surprised to get any responses to post, but it does happen once in a
while. Once I figure out how to work the commenting system here, maybe I
will get responses that way, but for now e-mail is the only way to
respond. Anyway, this was in the mail in response to my post about the
left side of the bell curve. Here’s the text, without identifying the
sender:

I’m going to assume that English is not the first language of my
correspondent and assume what he meant in the first bit is “reliance”
and not “subservience.” Relying on IQ as a rational measure of
intelligence is good enough for neuroscience so it is good enough for
me. We have a tremendous amount of data on human intelligence thanks to
a century of testing. Unless and until someone comes up with a better
way to measure intelligence, IQ is what we have. It’s one piece of the
puzzle, but an important and reliable part.

Now, the next bit is one area where there is great debate. Can you
structure a society-wide education systems to lift the average IQ of the
population? Maybe. Ron Unz has written some <a
href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/race-iq-and-wealth/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">excellent essays</a> on the subject. <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/IQ-Wealth-Nations-Richard-Lynn/dp/027597510X/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=vd0b-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Richard Lynn</a> is a good recent example
of the counter argument. We can throw <a
href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/08/opinion-jason-richwine-95353.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jason Richwine</a> in the mix as another
recent combatant on the topic of IQ and education. Then of course we
have the <a
href="http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/head-start-tragic-waste-money"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">dismal results from such programs as Head
Start</a>, which is a complete failure.

I’m of the opinion that the data and the science support the argument
that no amount of education will alter one’s intelligence. I’d go even
further and point to the many urban school systems that spend enormous
sums on students. If there is one place where we would see a causal
relationship between spending on education and educational outcomes, it
would be the urban school systems.  Education *could* have a non-trivial
impact on overall IQ, but so far no one has been able to find evidence
of it.

While that debate is interesting, it has absolutely nothing to do with
the central problem facing modern technological
societies. <span style="line-height: 1.625;">There will always be a left
side of the bell curve, no matter how you view education. Not even the
most rabid blank slate fanatic argues that we can raise the IQ level of
the bottom half to match that of the top half, resulting in everyone
being average. Well, maybe George Bush thinks that, given that he once
argued that the goal of his education policy as to make every kid above
average.</span>

The fact remains that even in Asian societies that lack a significant
African or Amerindian population, there are a lot of people with IQ’s
below what will be required in the technological future. This assumes
automation progresses as everyone seems to think it will in the coming
decades. <span style="line-height: 1.625;">Even if education can make
some difference, all you can do is increase the size of the smart
fraction. You will still be left with a large number of adults in the
labor pool unable to master anything beyond mundane tasks.</span>

The bit in the e-mail about the obsolete getting new skills is the
standard refrain from libertarians to my question. It is merely a dodge.
Instead of addressing the question, they answer a different, unasked
question. Every human society has a subset of people with a very low
ceiling. You cannot ship them away to a colony. You can’t send them off
to the lithium mines. They cannot be taught to trade mortgage backed
securities or teach gender studies at the community college. Every
society has to figure out what to do with them.

Having a small percentage of the population, say ten percent, that is
useless either because they are dumb or lack self-control is manageable.
When fifty percent of adults have no role in the economy because they
lack the IQ to do useful work, that’s a problem no society has had to
solve. A<span style="line-height: 1.625;"> large population of idle
dimwits getting into trouble is a very new problem that advanced
technological states will probably have to solve or they will be
destroyed by it. That means a very different form of
political </span>organization<span style="line-height: 1.625;"> in the
future.</span>
