The failure of conservatism is one of those things that has been
observed many times by many different people, but why it failed is never
discussed. The assumption is that conservatism failed because the people
in it did not try hard enough, or they were easily corrupted by the big
money donors. The underlying assumption is that it could have succeeded
and created the civil nationalist paradise.

This is why these successive efforts over the last decade to create a
new right have failed to get very far. They assume they just need to get
new people saying the same old things and they can get the band back
together. Christopher Rufo’s internet activism is in pursuit of the same
agenda as Buckley conservatism. It has the same agenda because it
learned nothing from failure.

The most likely answer to why conservatism failed, however, is that it
was doomed from the start and by start, I mean the founding.
Conservatism, in a nation that was never a nation, but rather a country
that saw itself as a radical experiment in liberty, was going to be the
first thing reformed out of existence. What a radical experiment of any
kind can never tolerate is anything in its way.

Conservativism in America was just slow progressivism, with
progressivism being the radical ideology at the core of the experiment.
As Dabney noted a century ago, conservatives were merely a drag on
progressivism. Its job was to slow the process but eventually concede to
the progressives. This meant that the reason conservatism failed is the
progressivism has failed.

That is the show this week. Technical issues made it difficult to record
and compile the show, so it may sound a bit wonky. Getting over those
technical issues left little time to organize my thoughts on this topic,
so it is mostly thinking aloud, but it is a subject I may returned to in
a future show. The death of conservatism is as much about the death of
progressivism as anything else.
