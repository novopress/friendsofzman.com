rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The US Supreme Court refused
to step into a slavery case</a> in New Mexico. The New Mexico Human
Rights Commission had ruled that two lesbians had the right to hold
photographers as a slaves, forcing them to perform photographic work for
them against their will. OK, that’s a bit of an exaggeration, but it is
not too far off. Forcing people to work for others against their will is
a form a slavery, just one that has some pay. That’s what is happening
with these cases where businessmen have to work for gays.

*The Supreme Court has refused to hear an appeal from Christian
photographers who were fined and admonished by the New Mexico Supreme
Court for declining to work a same-sex ceremony, in what could be a blow
to religious business owners.*

*The high court decision not to take up the appeal means the New Mexico
ruling against them stands. That ruling is only binding in New Mexico,
but could set a precedent that can be cited in subsequent cases.*

*In this case, Elane Photography, owned by Jon and Elaine Huguenin of
New Mexico, was brought to court for refusing to photograph a same-sex
couple’s commitment ceremony in 2006.*

*An attorney for the couple argued that the business openly advertises
its wedding photography services, and as a public business is required
to follow the same anti-discrimination laws as any other company.*

*The New Mexico Supreme Court ruled in August that the business’s
refusal to photograph the ceremony involving two women did violate the
state’s Human Rights Act.*

*Lawyers for the business, though, argued the ruling violates the
business owners’ free speech rights by compelling them to “express
messages that conflict with their religious beliefs.”*

*Elaine Huguenin said she also has a right of artistic expression under
the First Amendment that allows her to choose what pictures to take, or
refrain from taking.*

The reason the SCOTUS is avoiding these cases is obvious. As soon as
they grant a religious exceptions to private discrimination, freedom of
association will be out of the box again. How can one permit Christians
to avoid perverts, but not permit blacks to avoid Koreans? The current
principle is that your tastes, your preferences are not important in the
area of commerce, hiring and housing. if there is an exception made,
then the whole regime gets called into question.
