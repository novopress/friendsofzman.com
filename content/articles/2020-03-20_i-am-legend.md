The lock-down, at least around here, really got going on Monday and has
accelerated through the week. The weekend saw the hoarding, as public
officials started acting hysterically in front of the cameras. On
Monday, businesses started to wind down, sending people home if they
were not needed or could work from home. The parking lot at my office
was very light on Monday, but there were still people in the building.
By Thursday the parking lot was just about empty of all cars.

There’s some traffic on the roads, but it like a Sunday morning, rather
than a weekday or even a weekend afternoon. People are staying home, for
the most part. Not happy with their work, the government is talking
about a <a
href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/trump-eyes-grounding-jets-halting-stock-trading-ording-shelter-in-place"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nationwide quarantine</a>.
They are talking about grounding all passenger air traffic for up to 30
days, halting stock trading on Wall Street, and imposing a
shelter-in-place rule. Presumably, if one more person gets sick after
that, they will begin bombing American cities.

Yesterday I realized that I had not had a face-face conversation with
another human in a couple of days. I’ve spoken to people by phone and
had e-mail exchanges, but I’ve not talked to anyone in person for a
while. For whatever reason, I was reminded of the old Vincent Price
movie <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Man_on_Earth_(1964_film)"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Last Man on Earth</a>.
There was an old Twilight Zone episode of a similar nature. Of course,
there was the crappy Will Smith version on this theme, in which you end
up rooting for the monsters to get him.

In my fortress of solitude, I started thinking about another science
fiction classic,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mote-Gods-Eye-Larry-Niven/dp/0671741926"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Mote in God’s Eye</a>. In
the book, humans finally meet an alien species for the first time and
discover something called the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mote_in_God%27s_Eye#Crazy_Eddie"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Crazy Eddie</a>. This is a
mythical character the aliens use to explain the inevitability of
repeated cycles of collapse of the alien civilization and the
pointlessness of trying to prevent them. Anyone who thinks they can
solve the inherent defect in their society is called Crazy Eddie.

That’s the thing that does not get addressed in the tales of apocalypse
like I Am Legend or the many movies that spring from it. The plague
movies usually have a story line where the good guys can stop the plague
or maybe come up with a miracle cure for it afterward. In the
post-plague stories, after society has collapsed, the characters never
think much about how they got to that place. It’s just bad luck. The
collapse itself has no meaning other than as a devise to drive the plot
of the story.

Maybe what we are seeing here is the inevitable end of all human
society. From the perspective of time, the end point looks like a
fizzling out of a dying people, but to those in it, it looks like mass
insanity. Maybe this is what it looked like for those living in the late
Roman Empire or even the late days of the Republic. Then, as now, the
people speaking out against the gathering madness were dismissed as
madmen, as everyone set about pulling the roof down on civilization.

On the other hand, one has to consider the possibility that it is not
the world going mad, but you are the one going mad. It’s possible. There
are a lot of people looking around and wondering why we are doing this,
but maybe all of us are suffering from madness and the rest of the world
is acting sober minded. It’s possible, but that would mean they have a
secret way to feed people in a nationwide 30-day lock-down. Maybe
turning America into a hermit kingdom is the path to the Promised Land.

For the curious, if they can get past however they are responding to the
what’s happening right now, this is an amazing time. We will see things
that no one could have imagined seeing just a few weeks ago. No one can
know what follows a 30-day quarantine of a continent sized country. No
one really knows what will follow just this one week halt to the global
economy. No one knows what happens if the plague fears are wildly
overblown, which seems inevitable at this point.

Regardless of what follows, we are living in a time without precedent. A
century ago, we had a real plague, but the world did not stop. The stock
market collapse in the 1920’s did bring a closure, but it was not for a
month. The bank run that happened in 1933  resulted in a week-long bank
holiday, but the rest of society kept going. The past provides some
samples but nothing close to what is being contemplated. Heck, we are
already into uncharted territory with the one-week lock-down.

Maybe I am the crazy one, but crazy or not, messing with big complicated
things always has unanticipated results. This is an iron law of systems.
Even if the response is appropriate to the danger, taking a sledge
hammer to the very complex system that is American society will have
consequences that no one can anticipate. Another rule of complex systems
is you need to understand the iron law of systems before you are allowed
to even tinker with the system. That rule has been violated.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
