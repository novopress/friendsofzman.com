Last month Paul Gottfried wrote a brief
[note](https://chroniclesmagazine.org/web/opening-the-window-to-real-historical-debate-on-the-right/)
in Chronicles about an event hosted by The Philadelphia Society. The
event was a virtual debate between Christopher Owen and Glenn Ellmers on
the topic of which is the more important founding document, the
Declaration of Independence or the Constitution. Presumably, this is
some sort of old person role playing game where the two men reenact the
debates between Harry Jaffa and Willmoore Kendall from half a century
ago.

In fairness, revisiting this topic is useful for those wondering why
conservatives have a fetish for Lincoln. Maybe not this debate
specifically, but the debate between Kendal and Jaffa in the last
century. So-called conservatives embraced Jaffa’s rewriting of American
history because it solved their race problem. If one wants to understand
the “conservative case for” and the “democrats are the real racists”
memes, you start with Harry Jaffa’s Lincoln project.

Putting that aside, the purpose of Gottfried’s post was to point out
that these sorts of conservative groups operate like eccentric museums.
They claim to exist in order to promote debate, but in realty they exist
to prevent debate. Gottfried could be describing all of Conservative
Inc. with this line. “Although founded by Frank Meyer in 1964 as a
center for vigorous debate on the intellectual right, the Philadelphia
Society now exudes the freshness of an ancient Egyptian tomb.”

That is a slander against Egyptian tombs. At least when someone finds a
tomb, there is some curiosity about what is inside it. There is a chance
that archeologists will find something new or maybe answer an ancient
question. Inside conservative institutions there is nothing new. No one
needs to be curious about what is inside because everyone knows what is
inside. The point of these operations is to make sure nothing new ever
happens on the so-called Right.

Gottfried goes on to call for some new voices to be invited into these
institutions in order to freshen up the debate. Even if the geezers
inside are not interested in new ideas, at least they can freshen up
their old arguments a bit. Even museums spruce up the exhibits from time
to time. Of course, this will never happen and Gottfried concedes that
it can never happen as long as the tomb managers remain. Politics on the
Right advances one funeral at a time.

The thing is though, it is not all that clear that the actuarial tables
will solve the problem that haunts Conservative Inc. Look around at the
various institutions and you see plenty of young people, but they were
selected for their obsequiousness rather than their willingness to
challenge old thinking. They get picked and promoted in the same way the
Chinese exam system promoted people in the Song dynasty. Conformity is
the highest virtue in the conservative ecosystem.

The model for this is National Review. When Bill Buckley started
searching around for a successor, he went through a few talented men
until he found Rich Lowry. Those talented men threatened to change
things at National Review. Lowry was simply too stupid to change
anything. More important he was an obsequious rumpswab who would tend to
Buckley’s lifelong project like the men assigned to keep Lenin’s body on
display in the Kremlin. He was the ideal museum keeper.

This is not just a problem with conservatism. The ruling class of the
Global American Empire is the product of the 20th century. It evolved
for the 20th century and therefore seeks to maintain the conditions that
made it possible. It is why the origin point of every subculture within
it is the 20th century. Every issue is jammed into a narrative structure
that dates to 1938 or 1968. Every foreign enemy is a new version of
Hitler and every domestic villain is Bull Connor.

This is why there can be no airing out of the institutions. Even if the
crypt keepers of conservatism fling open the windows and let in some
fresh air, they will be forced to close those windows. The survival of
conservatism depends on it fitting into that 20th century narrative
structure that controls the ruling class. The only way those windows
remain open is if it is a bankruptcy sale. That particular institution
is being sold off because it is no longer needed.

It is also why the new “conservative” operations quickly begin to
conform to the old narratives as soon as they get attention. As long as
they are not an explicit rejection of the old thinking, they are
assimilated into the collective. First some famous people show up to
look around, then the money begins to flow. Before long, the “rebels”
are beginning to enjoy the perks that come with submission. They are
assimilated into the blob and become another node of the system.

Modern conservatism suffers from the same malady that plagues most of
the institutions of the empire. That is, it has no purpose. Once the
Soviet Union collapsed, the organizing purpose of the West collapsed
with it. The difference was the West thought it won the Cold War and
therefore was validated. The communists were under no such illusions, so
they got busy escaping the 20th century. The West thought it had arrived
at the end of history.

While it would be nice to see a wrecking ball smash through these
decrepit institutions of conservatism or maybe see a peasant revolt
against them, the reality is they will stagger on as long as the empire
exists. A feature of every dying empire is a fear of change and we are
clearly in that stage. Those old men keeping the museum exhibits going
on the Right, as well as their youthful apprentices, care only for
keeping the lights on for another day which means keeping the doors
locked.
