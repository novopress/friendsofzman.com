rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This is interesting</a>.

*While the tech industry has long aspired to be inclusive, the numbers
are dismal. Hardly a week passes by without media outlets highlighting
concerns about sexism, ageism or “founder profiling” in our industry.*

*The truth is that TechCrunch will not be able to solve the SF housing
crisis or increase STEM education in inner-city schools. We can’t offer
entrepreneurship classes in rural America or require VCs to screen
founders without considering their gender.*

*But there are great organizations who can. And we aim to support them.*

*Today we’re excited to announce TechCrunch Include, which is a program
designed to help social enterprises (nonprofit and for profit) working
to make tech a more inclusive place. The program offers a year’s worth
of access to TechCrunch resources — financial as well as media and
events. Our mission is to help these enterprises increase their
effectiveness on a variety of fronts, including fundraising, volunteers,
partnerships and media attention.*

*Participants will receive a number of benefits, including free
exhibition space and tickets to Disrupt and Hackathon events, free
attendance at all other events, and assistance with media/press
strategy. In addition, TechCrunch will commit a total of $50,000 a year
(starting in 2015) in direct financial support to select participants.
TechCrunch already awarded $50,000 this year to Girls Who Code.*

*Consider this our minimum viable product. As we learn more about how
TechCrunch can leverage its strengths, we may add to or modify this
list. Of course, we’re open to feedback and suggestions.*

*So who should apply? We’re open to all types of organizations, as long
as the mission is related to increasing diversity in tech. You do not
need to be based in San Francisco or even the U.S. to apply. In keeping
with TC’s love for startups, we’re especially eager to find compelling
groups with early traction that will really benefit from Include.*

Though not said, all of the dog whistles are there. This is for
non-white males. Why does Tech Crunch hate white guys?

Oh, right, never mind.

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The application</a> is
interesting. In the diversity rackets, you have to know all of the
buzzwords and code phrases if you going to be a playa. That’s what the
free form comment boxes are for. If they flat out ask if you’re black or
have a vagina, it spoils the fun. They don’t really want diversity after
all. What they want is people who think and act just like SWPL, but with
vaginas or brown skin.

I filled it out and in the comment boxes and put “I hate white people!”
over and over along with a few “I hate heterosexuals!” and “I hate men”
thrown in for variety. Fingers crossed!
