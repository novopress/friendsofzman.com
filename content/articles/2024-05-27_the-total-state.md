If you are of a certain age and inclination, reading *The Total State:
How Liberal Democracies Become Tyrannies*, a new <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Total-State-Liberal-Democracies-Tyrannies/dp/1684515580"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">book</a> by Auron MacIntyre, feels like a
trip down memory lane to a time when you were discovering the major
figures of what would eventually be called paleoconservatism. The text
is filled with references to Carl Schmidt, Machiavelli, Vilfredo Pareto,
James Burnham, Paul Gottfried, Sam Francis, and other figures who
feature prominently in the paleo subculture.

That is the first way to approach this book as the writer was by his own
account a garden variety conservative until a few years ago. That means
he accepted the neoconservative foreign policy claims, the libertarian
economics, and the civic nationalism of the Buckley crowd. The Trump
years, the 2020 election and Covid forced him to reevaluate that way of
framing politics. Working in the media, he also witnessed firsthand the
corruption and mendacity of the fifth estate.

Judging from the number of references to Covid and how often it is used
as an example in making points about what he calls the Total State, it
is fair to assume that the mass panic and group think within the
managerial class during Covid is what sent the writer on his journey out
of civic nationalism. The state’s willingness and ability to trample the
idea of a rights-based society in the name of public health, along with
the media cheerleading, broke the spell of civic nationalism.

What followed was a crash course in the ideas of the “alternative right”
as Paul Gottfried used to call it before that term was anathematized.
The result is this book which can be read as an intellectual journey.
Ideas common in dissident circles were new and amazing in their ability
to explain what was happening during Covid. The enthusiasm MacIntyre has
for the material will surely bring back memories for older readers who
recall experiencing this material in their youth.

Another way of reading this book is as a summary, a Cliff Notes version,
of managerialism and the managerial state. MacIntyre borrows the title
of the book from Carl Schmidt, who called this form of government *der
Totalstaat,* which translates into English as the Total State. He could
also have used the term Sam Francis used, Leviathan, or simply the
managerial state. All roughly mean the same thing, which is the
all-encompassing corporate state.

Read this way, this book is an excellent primer for the person who is
embarking on a journey out of civic nationalism. MacIntyre covers all
the important bits using accessible language and recent examples, like
the Covid panic. He makes good use of references to the pantheon of
stars that make up the paleo constellation but does so in a way that
does not require the reader to know about these people. It is an
introduction to other modes of conservative thought and the topic of
managerialism.

Still another way to approach this book is as the down payment on the
long overdue project of building an alternative intellectual framework.
What passes for the right in America was not much more complicated than
saying, “not so fast” to the schemes dreamed up by the people we call
the left. The closest anyone came to building an alternative moral
framework was Sam Francis who died before he could finish is <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Leviathan-Its-Enemies-Samuel-Francis/dp/159368049X"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">magnum opus</a>, *Leviathan and Its
Enemies*.

In <a href="https://www.unz.com/ghood/the-american-right-grows-up/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">his review</a> of *The Total State*, Greg
Hood suggests this might be the start or a restart of that project as
MacIntyre is not just a nobody on the internet. He is a member of the
so-called conservative media with access to influencers allowed to
operate unmolested on the public stage. He regularly turns up on
television during elections and has mainstream guests on his show.
MacIntyre dusting off these ideas from a perch within mainstream media
could be the start of the project.

There could be something to this as there is a gold rush right now to
find something to replace Buckley-style conservatism. There are formal
efforts like Yoram Hazony’s National Conservatism project and the
Claremont Institute. There are informal efforts among online content
creators, the sort of people I
<a href="https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=32014" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">called</a> Cosmos and those Dave Green <a
href="https://fiddlersgreene.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-the-linkedin-right"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">calls</a> the LinkedIn Right. There are
lots of people searching for a New Right and perhaps they discover a new
ideological framework.

The book is not without its flaws, of course. MacIntyre mentions Curtis
Yarvin too many times and one is counted as one too many. Yarvin simply
has no place in a serious discussion about politics or political theory.
Maybe his name was dropped because he is reportedly Peter Theil’s court
jester or maybe MacIntyre thinks this is a useful reference point for
his intended audience. Regardless, seeing Yarvin’s name turn up in
anything is like discovering a hair in your soup.

That aside, another quibble is one it inherits from paleoconservatism
and that is it cannot explain why managerialism exists. Burnham noticed
that it first appeared in fascist systems. Later writers observed that
communism was also good soil for the growth of managerialism. Now we see
American-style liberal democracy has also been overtaken by bourgeois
managers. This is hardly an accident, but paleos have never produced an
explanation for it.

That leads to another quibble that also comes from the paleo space.
MacIntyre cannot provide an answer for what to do about it. He finished
his book with three possible ends for The Total State. One is it
staggers on due to a monopoly of power. Another is it is replaced by a
strong man of some sort. The final option, the one MacIntyre prefers, is
that it slowly dies from its own internal contradictions. Note that none
of these lead to any action against the managerial system.

That was always the flaw of paleoconservatism. It was a call to inaction
in the face of perpetual revolution from the top. You cannot build a
political movement on a foundation that calls for hiding out in the
basement until the storm passes. Even if the storm passes, what comes
next will not be the work of those who choose inaction in the face of
danger, but by those who have a platform that calls for action in
pursuit of something different and better than hoping for nicer weather.

In the end, the judgment of any book is whether it did what it set out
to do, not what could have or should have done according to the critics.
When approached by any of the angles above, *The Total State*
accomplishes the goal of the author. It is a book for those who would
like a fuller understanding of the terms commonly used in dissident
circles and for the people looking for a path out of the banality of
what passes for conventional conservatism.
