Imagine if tomorrow members of the Biden administrations, including
Biden, start going around in public in the nude. They show up at press
conferences and photo sessions fully naked. Now further imagine that no
one in the media bothers to notice this and continues as if it is
perfectly normal. Maybe the cable channels start to add a “clothing
disinformation expert” to their rotation of fake experts. Regime toadies
decry nakedness disinformation from Russia.

Of course, this will be joined by waves of volunteer auxiliary toadies
on social media defending the new policy. All of a sudden, as if they
just got a new firmware update, they are off the Ukraine train and on
the naked train. They start harassing normal people, demanding that the
normals defend their opposition to the new nakedness, as if walking
around naked was always common and the normal people suddenly decided
that it was not acceptable. Naked Twitter becomes a thing.

Maybe this sounds ridiculous, but given the age in which we live, it
should be one of many absurdities on the list of probable things. We
live in an age in which outlandishly stupid people are presented as
experts. The president just had another <a
href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/mumbler-chief-bidens-lackluster-delivery-front-world-leader-draws-scorn-social-media"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">bizarre</a> press conference with the
Israel president. Of course, Biden mumbling to himself as he reads his
script is nothing compared to his bizarre sniffing of children. Biden
alone is enough to fill up the bizarro land bingo card.

In other words, what is strange about this time is not the steady stream
of weird and bizarre behavior, but the normalization of it. Everyone
reading this remembers a time when the media would have had a field day
with a president struggling to make it through these perfunctory events.
They would have made excuses like he was tired, or it was a bad camera
angle, but they would not have continued like it is perfectly normal for
the president to be a senile old coot.

That is something to keep in mind as the next chapter in the plan to
disqualify Trump from the 2024 election unfolds over the next months.
The ironically named Department of Justice has <a
href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/18/trump-says-special-counsel-told-him-hes-a-target-in-jan-6-probe.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">informed</a> Trump that a grand jury is
investigating him for crimes that probably do not exist. This is the
first step in bringing an indictment, which means another theatrical
arrest of the former president. The same cranks and crackpots who would
be pro-nudity will be cheering this online.

As if it was all coordinated, Jeb DeSantis had prepared a little script
where he not-so-subtly <a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/desantis-says-trump-ve-responded-forcefully-jan-6-rcna95018"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">cheers</a> the prospect of Trump being
removed from the race. Given that the only way Jeb wins the nomination
is if Trump is removed, this is not surprising. The naked opportunism is
not the part that matters. What matters is it is clear that his campaign
is based on the assumption that the system is so corrupt that no one
will complain when the frontrunner is legally barred from running.

There is an old saying in sports that pressure reveals character. People
never exposed to pressure often mistakenly think pressure makes
character, but you see that the former is correct with Jeb DeSantis. In
the hothouse of Florida politics, he looks like a strong leader. In the
pressure of national politics, he has failed every test. Worse yet, he
cannot seem to get past Trump making fun of him. Instead of being a
strong leader, we see he is a small, thin-skinned twerp of man.

Putting that aside, the <a
href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/18/trump-top-rivals-jan-6-00106938"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">normalization</a> of lawfare is well
underway. Again, as if it were coordinated, the media is pretending this
is normal. They make no effort to ask if this is how a healthy political
class should operate. Instead, the game is to shift the focus from the
propriety of this behavior by the government. The question in that post
could be said as, “given the outlandishly lawless behavior of the Biden
administration, is it now okay to arrest people noticing that behavior?”

It is not just Trump getting the Stasi treatment. In Michigan, the
secret police have <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/18/politics/michigan-fake-electors-bios/index.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">arrested</a> sixteen senior citizens for
the crime of participating in the 2020 election process as alternative
electors. The media is trying hard to disguise the fact that these
people are very old, but
<a href="https://twitter.com/RaheemKassam/status/1681398078803197961"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a> are their ages. Three years
after the fact, the regime is rounding up old people and threatening to
put them in prison for the remainder of their days, because they dared
to participate in the system.

This is not normal. The regime toadies will work hard to make it seem
normal, but what we are seeing is not normal. Sissies in conservative
media will mew about this being banana republic behavior, but this does
not happen in the third world. They lack the human capital to operate a
police state. This is what happens in a modern state undergoing a soft
coup against the system itself. America is becoming a police state run
by alien weirdos who hate the majority population.

More important, it is becoming the new normal. Once Trump is removed
from the ballot, people will come to accept that they are not allowed to
have candidates that address their issues, unless the people in charge
approve. The pundits will turn themselves into experts on judging if a
candidate is acceptable to the people in charge. While we will lack a
formal council of political clerics like Iran, the unofficial council of
clerics will make their voice known through the pundit class.

Imagine if tomorrow you are at a social event, and everyone is naked.
You are still wearing clothes, trying to explain why you are the normal
one. Your conservative friends tell you that nudity has always been a
conservative value. One of them produces a pic on his phone of Martin
Luther King giving a speech naked. He says to you, “Democrats are the
real clothists.” At that point, the pressure on you to strip down and
submit to the new normal may be too much to resist.

What we are living through right now is the choice Vaclav Havel
described in his
[story](https://hac.bard.edu/amor-mundi/the-power-of-the-powerless-vaclav-havel-2011-12-23)
of the green grocer. We can submit to the official lies, pretend that
arresting old people for questioning the source of the official lies is
perfectly normal. The other choice is we choose to live in the truth.
Most will submit because that is easy, but some with refuse and remain
living in the truth. They will win and we know this because the
communists are gone, and Havel’s words are still with us.

*The Guide and I into that hidden road*  
*Now entered, to return to the bright world;*  
*And without care of having any rest*

*We mounted up, he first and I the second,*  
*Till I beheld through a round aperture*  
*Some of the beauteous things that Heaven doth bear;*

*Thence we came forth to rebehold the stars.*
