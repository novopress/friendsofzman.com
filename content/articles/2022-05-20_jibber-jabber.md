The show this week is the season finale, so to speak. No show next week
as it is a long weekend in the United States. I need a little break to
catch up on some other items, so this is a good time for that. This week
I empty out the mailbag and address the complaints that have come in
since the last time. The title for the show reflects the fact that the
show has no theme. It is just a grab bag of topics that have accumulated
since the last mailbag show back in the winter.

Something I did not notice while compiling the show was that I have not
received any Covid questions or comments in a while. For a long time it
was close to a daily occurrence, then it settled into the same pattern
as other topics. Looking back, the last Covid e-mail was back in in the
winter. That means the topic has pretty much fallen out of the news
cycle now. There are efforts to revive the franchise but rebooting Covid
is going to be a tough sell, even to people on the Left.

Next up for a starring role on the big stage is the election. You can
see the shift already, as we head into the unofficial start of summer.
Ukraine is starting to slide down the page for the New York Times and
the Washington Post. This is no doubt this is coming at the direction of
the party, who may be figuring out that it is a loser issue. The big
spending bill that just passed signals the end of the line for the
Ukraine story in Washington as events on the ground turn negative for
them.

I have to say, this may be a hilarious election season from a dissident
perspective, as it is nothing but bad news for the uniparty. The GOP has
managed to stock their ticket with zombies from party central, but those
zombies will have no choice but to say mean things about Washington
while campaigning. Of course, Trump will be out there on the campaign
trail and you know he will be slinging mud at McConnell. It means
nothing, but it should make for good theater.

The real action is on the other side. I fear I may blow a funny fuse
watching the inner party explain how inflation, gas shortages and a
declining stock market are the fault of white supremacists invading
Ukraine. Even better will be watching Jean-Pierre, the black lesbian
Biden spokesbot read these lines from her script. I though Shark Eyes
Psaki was peak ridiculous in that job, but then they managed to find
another gear and give us someone dumber that old Jen.

It is going to be a rough period economically and a lot of our people
will suffer as a result, so we need to avoid being callous. We also have
to avoid getting sucked into the madness we see in convectional
politics. The best way to do that is to enjoy the absurdity of it and
the ridiculousness of the people. If I were to make a banner for the
Dissident Right convention, it would feature the band playing on the
deck of the Titanic as it went under. That is our best approach to the
current crisis.
