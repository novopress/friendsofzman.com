One of the ironies of the Trump phenomenon is that his most ardent
supporters and his many opponents focused on the man, when it was never
about the man. Ten years ago, no rational person would have picked
Donald Trump as the face of populist discontent, much less the most
consequential political figure in generations. When he ran, it was
assumed it was a publicity stunt, as he had spent his life as an
entertainment gadfly, finding ways to draw public attention to his real
estate schemes.

Yet, as the Trump era draws to a close, both his supporters and his
enemies have developed a political cult around the man. His supporters
are sure he has some last trick up his sleeve to do something to save
the country. His opponents are sure he has some trick up his sleeve to
steal their democracy from them. So much so, in fact, they have turned
the tiny internet fad called QAnon into a subversive conspiracy. There
are more anti-Q fanatics now than genuine followers of it.

The thing is, Trump was always an opportunist. In fact, he is the
extreme expression of the opportunist, which is how he went from Queens
landlord to one of the most famous and successful real estate developers
in the world. Real estate, especially the business of high-profile
resort properties, is about opportunity. You find a deal before everyone
else and cash in before the next big thing. Trump got rich finding the
next big thing before everyone else realized that it was the next big
thing.

Trump got into politics for all the same reasons everyone else runs for
office in a modern liberal democracy. He wanted affirmation. Unlike the
narcissistic robots that fill up both parties, Trump saw an opportunity
outside the system. The swelling ranks of disaffected whites, unhappy
with both parties, looked a lot like a neglected property with
tremendous promise, if the right investor came along. Most important
from Trump’s perspective, they were a motivated seller.

The first eager seller was Ann Coulter, who was one of the most
prominent celebrities to get on the Trump train. Well before anyone
thought Trump was a serious threat to the Republican nomination, she was
saying he would not only win the nomination but win the general
election. Queen Ann completely bought into Trump being the daddy she had
been waiting for her whole political life. She went to war for Trump the
man, believing he was the answer.

She was not alone in thinking Trump was the savior. The alt-right that
had been forming up on-line in the Obama years also went all in on
Trump. They convinced themselves he was the American Pinochet. Mike
Enoch of The Right Stuff jumped on the Trump train with the same
enthusiasm as Ann Coulter. Richard Spencer was a full-blown MAGA man.
The alt-right went to war for Trump in the 2016 election, so much so
that even Hillary Clinton felt the need to notice them.

The trouble is, Trump was never that man. He could never be that man. He
could never have won the nomination and the general election if he was
that man. Only an opportunist with no regard for what he was saying
could have gamed the system the way he did in 2016. Unlike Pat Buchanan
and Ross Perot who came before him, Donald Trump won because he was not
constrained by the truth. Like every opportunist, he was only focused on
exploiting the opportunity.

Of course, when this reality became too obvious to ignore, many people
jumped off the Trump train and became droning critics. Like jilted
lovers they could not stop talking about how the mean old orange man did
them wrong. They were not wrong to point out Trump’s faults. Their error
was in thinking he was their savior or that any man can be the savior in
this political system. They were sure and remain sure that you can vote
your way out of the defects of liberal democracy.

There are three lessons here. One is that Trump could never have existed
without the realty of the masses that supported him. He was just a front
runner, a guy who jumped to the head of a wave of people coming to terms
with the fact that we are entering a new era of politics. With or
without Trump, those people exist and will continue to exist with the
same grievances and concerns. Just because the dull knight vanquished
their champion, does not mean they cease to exist.

Another lesson is there is no way to reform this system. The sort of
person who can win an election is either a careerist sellout like every
member of the GOP or an outlandish outsider with no ability to govern.
The only way forward for dissidents is to focus on building outside the
system. A third of all adults and close to half of white people no
longer think the system is legitimate. Every day the people in charge
convert more people to this view with their authoritarian actions.

The final lesson here is that the old political labels are no longer
relevant. That is what the Trump era demonstrated. It is no longer about
conservative versus liberal or red team versus blue team. It is not
socialism versus capitalism. It is about those who live in the lie of
liberal democracy and those who live in the truth. If you live in the
truth, you not only oppose the people running the system, but you also
oppose the system that allows these criminal aliens to rule over us.
