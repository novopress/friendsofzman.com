------------------------------------------------------------------------

A popular aphorism on this side of the great divide is a line from the
poet T. S. Eliot who wrote “Humankind cannot bear very much reality.”
Most of the time it is part of a general critique of the age, with
regards to the human condition. Our betters, rather than face the
reality of the human condition, concoct comfortable sounding fantasies
to explain the inequality of man. The reason Johnny can’t read, for
example, is because of some flaw in the schools, not the mating
decisions of his ancestors.

Reality avoidance is a modern problem. In recent times it seems to have
become something of a plague on society. Movies and television have
shifted from fantastical tales of human achievement, like space travel,
to comic book tales of god-like creatures saving the child-like humans
from reality. Mainstream politics is one fantasy camp screaming at the
other fantasy camp over their imaginary differences. The mass media
makes fantasy literature look like a technical manual.

The election of Donald Trump has probably been the greatest catalyst for
political fantasy in American history. Since he came down the escalator
in 2015, few have bothered to look directly at the reality of this
phenomenon. Instead, all sides have spent the last five years building
elaborate, plausible explanations for what was happening around Trump,
rather than accepting it at face value. Our politics the last five years
has been a war between competing realities.

Those fantasy versions of Trump are not fixed. Take for example the
alt-right crowd that jumped on the Trump train earlier than anyone. They
convinced themselves he was the Pinochet they imagined, who would come
to power and rescue them from the fringes of political reality. When the
reality of Trump turned out to not be something other than the rise of
the god-emperor, they turned the other way and created a fantasy world
in which they have always been deeply skeptical of Trump.

In this version of reality, we see the use of a scapegoat character that
is common to all of the political fantasy camps. The “boomer” is the
uncritical believer in conservative politics that is the archenemy of
the red-pilled realist. Whatever contradicts the fantasy is boomer
politics. They heap onto this character all of the things they think are
wrong with modern politics. Even their impotence is the fault of the
boomer. For them, Trump is the king of the boomers, who refused to
accept the red-pill.

Of course, fantasy has a kernel of reality. The people still convinced
that Trump will make some last-minute move to deny Biden the election
are delusional. They can accept that the election was rigged, but they
cannot accept that this is the result of a deeply corrupt system that is
beyond reform. They hold onto the fantasy that somehow, within the
rules, there is a solution to the problem. They are now like a UFO cult
waiting for January 6th to see the prophesy revealed.

Probably the most deluded people in this age are those fully invested in
establishment politics, both Left and Right. The cranks and nutjobs
embracing woke politics think they are fighting the man. The fact that
the most powerful institutions on earth are backing them is lost in the
fantasy. The racketeers of Conservative Inc., in contrast, are sure that
once Trump is gone it is back to business. They will be out there
selling Reagan and Buckley memorabilia to a new generation of
conservatives.

Lost in all of this is the fact that Trump will waddle off the stage
next month and no longer serve as the catalyst to these fantasies. The
red-pilled crowd will need to come up with a new way to convince
themselves they are special snowflakes. They won’t have the MAGA-hat
wearing boomer as a foil. The true believers in MAGA world will not have
Q or their god emperor to star in their fantasy. Both sides of this
relationship will be looking for a new type of escapism.

The mainstream crowd will have it a bit easier, simply because they can
plug into mass media and forgot about the world. Still, they will have
to come to grips with the fact that they helped install a dementia
patient in the White House. The people around the Pretender Biden are
not interested in the colored revolution. They just want to steal as
much as they can before it is too late. Those longer for a return to the
old ways will have to find a new excuse for why things are not working.

Next month will kick off something of a triple witching hour in the
fantasy camps of American politics. The three main camps have relied on
Trump as a tent pole to hold up their preferred version of reality. With
Trump headed off to retirement, those fantasy versions of realty are no
longer tenable. The red-pilled will need a new way to pretend they are
special snowflakes. The MAGA crowd will need a new banner around which
to rally and the blue-pilled will need a new devil.

People may prefer fantasy to reality, but reality does not go away when
you stop believing in it. In the coming months, lots of people are going
to arrive at the end of a fantasy road. Maybe they come up with a new
fantasy. Maybe the ruling class brings back the escapism of sports and
consumerism. It’s also possible that people have run out of ways to
avoid facing the reality of this age. Like all forms of escapism, the
world of fantasy politics may be coming to an end.
