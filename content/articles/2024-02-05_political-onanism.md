------------------------------------------------------------------------

Carl Schmitt famously said that “the political is reducible to the
existential distinction between friend and enemy.” The shorthand you
hear in dissident circles is that politics is about friends and enemies.
You can see this in your own life when it comes to some issue with which
you have been on the opposite side of a friend. That person may now be a
former friend if the issue was important at the time. It is why families
often avoid talking about politics during the holidays.

A practical aspect of this reality is that political activism should
always seek to harm the opponent and boost your side. An action that
makes the other side look bad is good activism and it is even better
activism if it also makes you look good. Of course, bad activism is that
which boosts the enemy and harms you. The Charlottesville rally in 2018
turned out to be disastrous activism for the alt-right. It rallied their
enemies and gutted their support in the broader community.

Life is not always so cut and dried. Generational politics, for example,
often feels like good politics to the people doing it. Whether it is
young people moaning about old people having had it easy or old people
moaning about young people having it easy, the people doing it always
feel good about it. A Nick Fuentes feels like a hero when he
<a href="https://t.me/nickjfuentes/12407" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">makes fun</a> of adults for being adults. He thinks it
is good politics because it brings in money and gets his young fans
excited.

Of course, this goes both ways. Matt Walsh from the Daily Wire often
makes fun of Zoomers for being whiny and soft. Recently, a young girl
posted a video of herself crying about having to work forty hours a week
and still not having money to live like she did in college so Matt Walsh
made
<a href="https://twitter.com/MattWalshBlog/status/1753080080556011738"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">sport</a> of her. The young people who
always complain about the boomers then piled in to tell him he was a
horrible person for not empathizing with the young girls in the video.

At a personal level, generational politics is good as it makes money for
the people doing it, but at another level it is bad for their overall
political mission. The only people engaged in generational politics are
white people who are either in white identity politics or aligned with
it. Nick Fuentes casts himself as a white identitarian, but he spends a
lot of time mocking white people. Matt Walsh opposes antiwhite politics,
but like Nick Fuentes, he spends most of his time attacking white
people.

You will note that the people who control the culture are fine with this
sort of politics, despite it coming from people they hate. In popular
culture you will never see a young black guy calling his grandfather a
boomer. You will not see an old Jewish guy laughing at his grandson’s
student loan debt. For the people who control the centers of cultural
production, generational politics is only for white people. It is one
part of their antiwhite pogroms that have come to define popular
culture.

Generational politics is not politics at all but a form of political
onanism. It is not only a fruitless activity, but it also discourages
the sort of politics that could bear fruit. It is no different from the
war of the sexes business, where feminists and anti-feminists seek to
pit white males against white females. Whatever the truth of the mutual
critiques, it is not an activity that can lead to anything other than
temporary ecstasy. It is a form of politics that can never lead to good
activism or any activism.

For example, look at the recent trend of attacking Reagan. Critics
correctly note that he signed off on immigration reform. He also ushered
in economic reforms that now feel like bad ideas, especially for young
people. This critique of Regan usually ends with angry shouting at
boomers for having enjoyed the good times that followed the reforms of
that period. The boomers are bad people for having enjoyed a good stock
market and low interest rates over the last forty years.

Let us assume that Reagan and his supporters were evil people who knew
what they were doing would harm their grandchildren and great
grandchildren. Let us also pretend that the boomers all agreed it would
wreck the country for their children and grandchildren who they would
live to see. Even if you could prove this, what would be the point of
doing it? The most you get from it is the momentary satisfaction of
shaking your first at an imaginary version of the past.

The reason to care about the past is to understand how you reached the
present and to have some sense of what comes next. Understanding the
politics around the Reagan era immigration policies is about
understanding the nature of the people behind the just proposed
immigration reform bill in the senate. Chuck Schumer put that together
because he hates you and he has always hated you. There is no talking
him and his allies out of hating you. He is the forever enemy.

There you see the problem with generational politics. The young people
trembling with anger over the thought of Ronald Reagan are focusing on
their grandparents rather than the people who finked on their
grandparents, the same people who are now trying to close the door on
America, by opening up the borders. It is a politics that turns old
friends into imaginary enemies and enemies into fans cheering the people
attacking one another in the arena of generational politics.
