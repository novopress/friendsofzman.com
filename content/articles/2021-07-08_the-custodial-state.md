One of the weirder aspects of the Covid panic was how every corporation
decided they needed to do their duty with regards to panic. In many
respects, they were the primary fear mongers, as people interface with
corporations multiple times a day, while it is possible to tune out the
government. For most people, the yammering meat sticks in the media are
just the background noise of life. The corporation, on the other hand,
is the safety rails of their life, guiding them as hey go about their
business.

Shortly after the politicians declared mass panic, every retail chain
was busy putting up signs, setting up social distancing protocols and
training an army of harpies to lecture people about the need to be safe.
The banal overhead music was replaced with endless chants about how much
they cared and wanted you to be safe. Those declarations were followed
by the robot voice telling you to obey the latest edicts from the CDC
about social distancing and dousing yourself in alcohol gel.

The weird part about it was not that it was right out of dystopian
science fiction movies where people live in high tech penal colonies.
What was weird is no one noticed that we were suddenly thrust into high
tech day care centers. The fact that corporations would take the lead
was just expected. Something similar happened with the antiwhite pogroms
launched after George Floyd. It was corporate America leading the war on
white people through ads, TV shows, sporting events and movies.

Again, the remarkable thing about this is not that corporate America is
hyper-political now, but that everyone just accepts it without notice.
Here is <a
href="https://taibbi.substack.com/p/a-case-of-intellectual-capture-on"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">a story</a> by Matt Taibbi about YouTube
censoring someone named Bret Weinstein. He walks through the travails of
Mr. Weinstein and other Covid skeptics who have been harried by faceless
censors on social media platforms. It is a weird blend of
passive-aggressiveness and technological superficiality. It is Kafka
meets Hal 9000.

The thing that Taibbi does not mention is why these companies suddenly
think it is their duty to police what people say. All of the heads of
these tech firms regular say they have a duty to police what people say
on their platforms. The retail chains that decorated their stores with
Covid stuff took the same stance. They were doing their duty by pushing
you around in their stores. It was not profit or the satisfaction of
their shareholders at the top of their list. It was your safety.

We have gone from a world where private companies should have the right
to regulate what happens in their firms because property rights are
essential, to a world where they must regulate what happens because the
public good demands it. In the blink of an eye, all of corporate America
is of one mind on all issues and they volunteer to be on the front lines
of the fight over those issues. America is now a massive daycare center
run by corporations acting like matronly old hens.

It turns out that C. S. Lewis got it exactly right when he said, “Of all
tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may
be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons
than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron’s cruelty may
sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those
who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do
so with the approval of their own conscience.”

The custodial state turns out to be worse than the authoritarian state
imagined by Orwell, because there is no face to the enemy. In 1984, it
was Big Brother who ruled with an iron fist for his own sake. In the
custodial state it is an invisible network of mother hens with unlimited
resources. With one hand they dispense the pleasures of life and with
the other hand they grab you by the scruff and make sure you eat your
broccoli before leaving the table. All we see is the hand, never the
face.

Because they are faceless, there is also no way to appeal to their
humanity, their sense of fair play or the rules they claim to follow.
When YouTube bans you from their platform, they issue a form of “Because
I’m your mother and I say so” when you try to appeal their decision.
When the bank shuts down your bank account, they make sure to inform you
that this hurts them more than it hurts you. Declaring themselves a
selfless nanny of the custodial state makes it all right.

The custodial state is the sensibilities of women armed with the weapons
and power created by men. This is what lies behind the popular lunacies
of Critical Race Theory, wokeness and white fragility. Every one of
these is pushed by a thousand perfumed hands as a way to show how much
they care for all of their children. Stripped of the Marxist jargon, it
is nothing more than a mother standing over her children telling them to
play nice and share their toys with one another.

In the *Assemblywomen*, the 4th century BC playwright Aristophanes
described a world in which the women of Athens gained control of the
government. Before long the city fell into a chaos that is familiar to
us today. Men were wearing their wives’ clothing, ugly women were
demanding that men see them as attractive and, of course, everyone was
supposed to share their good with the community. In short order the
normal rhythms of Athenian life give way to the chaos of female tyranny.

Aristophanes never explained how it ended, because it was just assumed
that no such thing could last very long. That was what made the play a
comedy. America will soon find out how a gynocratic custodial state
ends. Maybe modern people are happy to sink quietly into the darkness of
infantilization. Rather than take up their posts in the adult world,
they prefer to live like children, a modern Eloi. The collapsing
fertility rates and increasing dependency suggest the end of us is a
form of crib death.

*“‘It seemed to me that I had happened upon humanity upon the wane. The
ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind. For the first
time I began to realize an odd consequence of the social effort in which
we are at present engaged. And yet, come to think, it is a logical
consequence enough. Strength is the outcome of need; security sets a
premium on feebleness. The work of ameliorating the conditions of
life—the true civilizing process that makes life more and more secure—
had gone steadily on to a climax. One triumph of a united humanity over
Nature had followed another. Things that are now mere dreams had become
projects deliberately put in hand and carried forward. And the harvest
was what I saw!”*
