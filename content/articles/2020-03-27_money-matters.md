A favorite expression is “pressure reveals character.” Anyone who has
played sports has probably used the expression. It is one of those
truths of life that turns up all over, but is most obvious in sports.
Guys can look like heroes in practice when everyone is loose and there
is nothing on the line. In the game, they perform poorly, unable to
perform under pressure. It’s why the military performs live fire
exercises. It’s a way to see how men will perform under the extreme
pressure of combat.

A public crisis like the current panic over the virus is where we see
how people operate under pressure. More than a few people, who we
thought to be steely-eyed cynics, have been revealed to be hysterical
ninnies. Nassim Taleb, who really likes to tell everyone he is a man’s
man, has gone so far as to post a <a
href="https://www.academia.edu/42223846/Ethics_of_Precaution_Individual_and_Systemic_Risk"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one page paper</a> explaining
how best to throw your dress over your head and run around shrieking
like a girl. He brings to mind this
<a href="https://youtu.be/qvPugcb7QGE" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">classic scene</a> from the movie Airplane!

<a
href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EUEFzAMU0AA7hvK?format=jpg&amp;name=large"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This graph</a> gets to
something else that has been revealed during this crisis. Those inclined
to left-wing politics are more easily frightened than those attracted to
more sober minded approaches to public policy. It is something to keep
in mind when looking at how our guys have reacted to this crisis. For
example, many of the
<a href="https://twitter.com/RichardBSpencer?lang=en"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">old alt-right people</a> now
sound like one of the girls from the Huffington Post. It is a good
reminder that there is a left-right axis within dissident politics.

Another thing the pressure of the moment has revealed, something I touch
on in the show, is that many of our guys are wholly ignorant of
economics. Given that the rejection of the neoliberal economic order is
one commonality on this side of the great divide, it is a bit surprising
that many of our guys do not have the first clue about how the system
actually works. More than a few of our guys have taken to sounding like
<a
href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/aoc-blasts-coronavirus-stimulus-blames-gop-for-not-granting-checks-to-all-immigrants"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of the girls</a> from the
Democratic Socialist camp.

Of course, much of this is the result of people living outside the
system that most people take for granted. The typical college professor,
for example, spends his life in the adult daycare center we call the
college campus. He lives in a fantasy world. Eventually, his
understanding of reality is warped by that fantasy world. It’s easy to
demand we pull out all the stops against this virus when you feel as if
you are immune to the consequences of pulling out all the stops. It’s
easy to be generous in behalf of others.

Similarly, people completely invested in politics can also become
divorced from the daily reality of life. It is surprising just how many
well-known figures in dissident politics don’t have jobs and never had
jobs. Maybe they kicked around the publishing world or the academy, but
that’s not real work. In the world of political theory, staking out an
extreme position has no cost. In fact, it is often the point. In the
real world where people live, staking out the extreme position has a
cost, a big one.

This is why the stimulus bills that get passed during each crisis get
bigger. There’s no benefit to prudence, so no one considers it. There is
a benefit to showering favored constituents with cash, so everyone tries
to be the most generous. It’s also why these efforts never amount to
much. The people crafting them don’t have the slightest clue how the
retail economy works. Small business is as alien to them as everything
else about the people over whom they rule.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"

href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-z-blog-power-hour?refid=stpr"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stitcher</a> for the weirdos.
YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
