**Note:** Today I will be on with professor Ed Dutton. We will be
watching women’s beach volleyball together and commenting about it
MST3000 style. The livestream is on the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DrEdwardDuttonTheJollyHeretic"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube</a> at 2PM eastern. He posts
replay on
<a href="https://www.bitchute.com/channel/1MUVaTZWgbLj/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Bitchute</a> so when that link is available, it will be
posted here.

I also have a post up about the classic film The French Connection. This
is behind the green door for subscribers. For those who have not
subscribed may Allah send a gaggle of chubby feminists to your Christmas
party.

A wise person once said that the revolution comes when a conservative of
some sort is addressing a crowd and when he starts babbling about the
evils of racism, the crowd begins to snicker and then starts laughing.
In other words, there will come a point when white people have caught
onto the scam privately then they realize that everyone else has caught
on as well. The revolution is people realizing that everyone else is
thinking the same taboo things privately.

It may not be that dramatic, of course, but that is a good way to think
about how attitudes change slowly then all of a sudden. We may be seeing
some of the slowly part as we close out the year. The jury in the Kim
Potter manslaughter trial is in its third of day of deliberations and
may be headed to a hung jury. Kim Potter is the former policewoman who
killed Daunte Wright during a traffic stop. She mistakenly used her
service weapon rather than her taser and shot him in the chest.

The case, of course, is highly important because it happened during the
Derek Chauvin trial in the same general area. Minnesota has become
ground zero for proving that diversity plus proximity equals violence.
They have had four high profile police shootings involving diversity. In
three cases the victims were diverse and the officer white, while in one
case the officer was diverse while the victim was white. The results say
a lot about where we are as far as diversity.

What makes the Potter case interesting is she was not charged with
intentionally killing Wright as we saw with Chauvin. There is no
question as to what happened in this case as it was caught on video and
Potter admits to the facts. The issue at hand is whether she should be
put in prison for an honest mistake. Under normal circumstances, third
degree manslaughter would be a slam dunk for the prosecutor. All of a
sudden, it is not looking like the easy conviction they imagined.

The suspicion is that at least two jurors have refused to convict. That
suggests we may be seeing a new type of jury nullification. Not a single
person in that courtroom is unaware of the fact the Derek Chauvin was
railroaded by the state and sent to prison for twenty years because he
is white. Everyone in the courtroom knows the Feds have piled onto
Chauvin making sure he has no chance to overturn his verdict by hitting
him with trumped up <a
href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/derek-chauvin-pleads-guilty-federal-civil-rights-case-avoid-life-prison"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">civil rights</a> charges.

Again, a reasonable person can look at the Potter case and conclude she
deserves the same as a drunk driver, which is about ten years.
Recklessly taking a life, regardless of your profession, requires a
punishment. This is easy stuff but all of a sudden it is not so easy for
this jury and the most likely reason is they follow the news. They
notice that there are no more white people in TV ads. They have had to
sit through diversity training at the office. Their kids are facing it
at school.

The other bit of evidence that private conversations are turning away
from the prevailing orthodoxy is the Rittenhouse trial. Reports from the
trial suggest many of the jurors were offended by the spectacle. It was
clear that one juror tried to shanghai deliberations but was bullied
into submission. That jury was given every chance to convict Rittenhouse
on a lesser charge. Instead of taking the easy way out they decided to
send a message and acquit on all charges.

Individually these sorts of events can be explained with whatever theory
you find comforting but taken together we are seeing a trend. White
people are figuring out that they are the target, not some abstract
baddy like Nazis and racists. When they watch a football game, they see
the crowd is white, but the ads all feature black people in unrealistic
settings. Maybe they notice out loud around friends and those friends
laugh uncomfortably at first, but then it becomes a thing.

This does not mean that every white person in America is suddenly going
to become a white nationalist or anything close to it. What it means is
that we are heading into a new phase of the struggle. White people are
increasingly comfortable with the idea that they are being made a
scapegoat because they are white. That means the lunatics bellowing
about racism are suddenly going to see their audience shrink. Attitudes
are shifting slowly and that changes the battlefield.

The hopelessly pessimistic will want to dismiss this as pessimism is a
form of escapism, like libertarianism. The pessimist always seeks to
dismiss the positive, so he does not have to act on it. He can remain on
the sidelines, smugly brooding about the end of the world, while
everyone else is in the struggle. His only comfort is the libertarian,
smugly assuring him that he will be proven right in the end, between
rounds of smelling his own farts, of course.

The reality of this struggle is that reality has always been on the side
of dissident and is on the side of the people who make civilization
possible. Civilization operates in a longer time span than we would
like, but the course of history is always bending to conform with
biological reality. It is often hard for us to see it, but there are
times, like now, when you see the signs of a turning. Like the line
about bankruptcy, revolutions are slowly then all of a sudden.
