Note: There is
<a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/posts/415649" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">new content</a> behind the green door. For those
interested in the Western, I have a review of the 1969 classic *The Wild
Bunch*. The role of the Western is something I’ll come back to again. It
is an interesting topic.

The <a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/theranos-blockbuster-trial-starts-wednesday-whose-story-will-jury-believe-n1278657"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">fraud trial</a> of Elizabeth Holmes
begins this week, and it promises to be an enjoyable bit of theater for
those interested in the workings of the Cloud People. Holmes founded a
company called Theranos when she was just 19-years-old. She had dropped
out of Stanford and promised to deliver miracle drug testing equipment.
She attracted the support of all the beautiful people, who saw her as
the living example of everything the Cloud People believed about the
world.

In reality, the company had nothing to offer other than the promise to
fulfill those prophesies the Cloud People cherished. Holmes adopted the
Steve Jobs black turtleneck and spoke in a weird deep voice. Like all
grifters, she was short on specifics, but long on inspirational
flattery. This got some of the most famous men in the world to support
her company, giving it an aura of authenticity. As a result, Theranos
stuck around for a dozen years before it was revealed as a fraud.

In many respects, Holmes is the poster child for the new religion. The
reimagined gender role for women is just women doing the things men
normally do. You see this in movies where the normal male lead is
replaced by a strong diverse female who does all the same things as a
male lead, even the personality. There is really nothing new about the
new gender roles. The new ideal female is nothing more than a fraud
against nature, a fraud that is eventually undone by observable reality.

That is the story the Feds will tell in court. They will point out that
nothing about this company was based in reality. Holmes and her business
partner, another unicorn of the Progressive imagination named Ramesh
“Sunny” Balwani, knew all along that their new technology would never
work. They hid the facts from investors in order to swindle them, the
textbook definition of fraud. More important, she damaged the cause of
women in the workplace, which is her biggest sin.

From the perspective of the Dirt People, the Elizabeth Holmes story is
great fun and also a reason to keep fighting. One look at
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGfaJZAdfNE" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">this woman</a> and a normal man in control of his senses
could see she was trouble. Many people at the time made this point, but
the Cloud People fell for her shenanigans hook, line, and sinker. It is
a good reminder that these people are not evil super geniuses. They are
frauds like Holmes who now have real power, but they are not unbeatable.

The Holmes story is also a good example of abductive reasoning. This is
the type of reasoning that makes a conclusion on what you know or what
you think you know, which is always an incomplete set of data. You wake
up in the morning and you see the driveway is wet, so you quickly assume
it rained overnight. There could be other explanations, like your
automatic sprinkler is on the fritz or a pipe burst somewhere during the
night, but rain is the most likely answer.

The important thing about abductive reasoning is that the explanation
for the given facts does not have to be right to be accepted. After all,
the explanation is simply the most probable, based on the data set. This
is why in the hands of a good storyteller, abductive reasoning is very
powerful magic. Humans are hard wired to accept stories, so a good story
that explains what is going on can quickly become gospel. A good story
that confirms the gospel is never questioned.

This is what Holmes was doing with her presentation to Cloud People. She
presented herself as living proof of the one true faith. She was every
bit as talented as the pale males in Silicon Valley. She could do
anything a man could do, even sound like them and run an identity cult
like Steve Jobs. Apple became one of the world’s biggest companies
selling toys disguised as holy relics. Holmes was the female Steve Jobs,
but saving the world, rather than entertaining it.

Another interesting aspect to the trial is the plan by the defense to
blame her former partner for everything. The old story of gender said
that women were always the victims of male oppression. Women who killed
their husbands for the insurance would always accuse the dead man of
being abusive. That story was being replaced by the new story of female
empowerment. The jury will be presented with a conflict of the two
absurd visions of womanhood promoted by the Cloud People.

This story is a good example of how facts play a supporting role in
life. People are believing machines. Even the most cynical hard cases
among the Cloud People believe they are on the side of angels. It is why
facts and reason have no effect on these people, outside of the
extremes. Once the reality of Theranos was too much to ignore, the Cloud
People abandoned their unicorn, but only after it became clear that
Holmes was a mockery of their beliefs, rather than confirmation.

That is why the endless presentation of facts and reason falls on deaf
ears. The Cloud People will never abandon their faith for mere facts.
The only thing that will get them to abandon their faith is a better
faith. This was the central insight of you know who back in the last
century. His story of redemption covered the observable, and his new
facts was the mortar that held them together into a coherent narrative.
That is what awaits the Cloud People running the American empire.
