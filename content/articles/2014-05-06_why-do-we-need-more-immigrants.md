rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In this post</a> about the
economics of Brooklyn, there is this bit of data:

*<span style="font-family: inherit;">Kind of. In 2011, the Census
estimated the median household in Brooklyn earned $42,752 a year.  In
1999 the Census estimated the median household income in Brooklyn
was…$42,852 (in [2011 dollars](http://www.westegg.com/inflation/); the
listed figure in 1999 dollars is $32,135).  That’s compared to a
national median household income of $50,502 (in 2011) and
$55,999</span> (in 1999), again using 2011 dollars.  In constant
dollars, Brooklyn stagnated while incomes dropped elsewhere.*

In that period, we have probably absorbed 20 million legal immigrants.
Some claim we have also added another 10-15 million illegal immigrants.
The debate over the exact figures is pointless. Everyone agrees we have
added a whole bunch new people. This at a time when Americans are
getting poorer, outside the over-class and managerial class. They are
doing great, naturally, but the middle class is slowly being drained
away by globalism and the resulting wage constraints.

The sentimentality of immigration is tough to resist. The myth of
immigrant America has been sold to us for generations. People are
conditioned to think immigration is one of the great virtues of America.
The mathematics of it, however, are beyond dispute. The elites are
deliberately impoverishing the country by importing millions of
foreigners, who suppress wages and bid up housing.
