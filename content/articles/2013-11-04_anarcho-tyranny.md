I’ve never been a believer in supplements. The reason is I’m a natural
skeptic and the claims always set of my BS detector. The other reason is
I know a bit about nutrition and science. Humans have evolved as
omnivores. We can get the nutrition we need from a wide range of
sources. In modern times, with so much food available to us, the odds of
missing something important are close to zero. It’s why no one calls in
sick because their rickets or scurvy is acting up. We have more than
enough food.

All of those fat people waddling in and out of Walmart are not lacking
in essential vitamins or minerals. Similarly, the health benefits of
these things are dubious. It is rare that you see real science backing a
claim. Even in cases where there is some correlation between a
supplement and a positive life outcome, the benefits are weak. Take a
vitamin may help in some small way, but not enough to worry about not
taking one. That said, most of it is harmless so taking a multivitamin
every day is not going to kill you.

At least that’s what I used to think. <a

many people have been harmed by this crap. Whenever I watch TV, I see
ambulance chasers looking for victims of one drug or another. Often, the
causes of the alleged injury is something I heard marketed just the year
before. Maybe it is just another scam, but some portion are legitimate.
Given that these companies appear to be jamming whatever they can find
into gelcaps and selling it to the public, I suspect a lot more harm is
being done than we know.

I suppose a terrible farting spell is not the end of the world, but it
is not something you should expect from a pill being sold in America. We
have this massive regulatory state and yet they allow crooks to sell
fart pills to the public without any consequences. Giving people a
“powerful laxative” when they are hoping for a little help with their
depression is downright monstrous. Unless what is bringing you low is a
lack of fiber, and that seems highly unlikely, giving depressed person
the runs sounds quite cruel.

All of this is fraud and is easily policed. The trouble is we have a
government that is no longer interested in this basic functions. These
require effort and risk by the bureaucrats within the custodial state.
These companies have money and lawyers. They can fight back. Crimes like
fraud are allowed to go on because the state has no desire to enforce
these laws. Yet, someone with a real drug that can help real people will
be faced with the wall of regulation promulgated by the state.
