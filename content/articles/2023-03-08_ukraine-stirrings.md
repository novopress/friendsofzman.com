Last Friday, the ruler of Germany got on a plane and flew to Washington,
then took a car service to the White House for a private meeting with
Joe Biden. He was not accompanied by German media. After the meeting,
the White House <a
href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/03/readout-of-president-joe-bidens-meeting-with-chancellor-olaf-scholz-of-germany/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">issued</a> a one paragraph summary of the
meeting. There was a brief
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcuzwIL5qkQ" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">media show</a> after the meeting and then Scholz got
back on a plane to Berlin. Regime media then <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/03/us/politics/biden-scholz-ukraine-china.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">issued</a> the usual agit-prop about the
collective West’s commitment to victory.

The whole thing was extremely bizarre, even by current standards.
Normally when a  head of state visits Washington, they bring their media
to cover it. They typically bring some of their most important citizens
to meet Washington officials. Often, the visiting head of state will
stay the night in the White House, even if there is no official state
dinner on the agenda. The trip is finished off by a press conference in
which state media from both countries put on a show.

One interpretation of this bizarre event is that Scholz was summoned to
the imperial capital so he could be reminded that Washington would not
think twice about regime changing him and the other flunkies in his
government. The German political class may be craven and obsequious, but
they are not so stupid as to not understand what is going on with the
war on Russia. A year on and none of the predictions from Washington
have turned out to be accurate.

The reason that the promise of new super tanks for Ukraine has fallen
apart is the Germans cannot scrape up enough of them. The reason for
that is the internal resistance in Germany to supplying what is left of
German weapons. This is not just a German problem, but it is signaling
to the other EU counties that it is probably a good idea to not give the
store away. This meeting could have been a warning to Scholz about what
happens when you defy the empire.

Alternatively, Scholz could have been dispatched to deliver a secret
message to Washington on behalf of Europe. Given the shabby state of
things in the West, the only way to make sure such a message was not
leaked to the world would be to hand deliver it in the White House.
Scholz met privately with Biden for one hour. This means no one can be
sure what was said in that meeting. Most likely, Biden had his key
handlers there to receive the message from Scholz.

A third option is that Scholz was summoned so that Washington could
confirm that it was Washington that ordered the bombing of the gas
lines. What followed the meeting was a
<a href="https://archive.is/53Oxz" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">claim</a> laundered through regime media that it was the
Ukrainians that bombed the Nord Stream pipelines. The absurdity of the
claim notwithstanding, this could be misdirection to give Scholz some
cover. Maybe the disclosure came with some promises to help in other
areas.

A fourth option is that Washington is planning to expand the war to
include China, with the excuse being the claim that China is selling
arms to Russia. China is a vital trading partner for Germany. Scholz
recently met with the Chinese and <a
href="https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/3212456/germanys-olaf-scholz-warns-consequences-if-china-sends-arms-russia"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">issued</a> Washington supplied statements
about the consequences of selling arms to Russia. This secret meeting
could be part of some backdoor discussion with China or about looming
sanctions on China over support for Russia.

On the other hand, the Germans have been increasingly restless about the
progress in the war, so this meeting could have been a warning to
Washington. The German economy is in a precarious state due to
sanctions. Europe avoided an energy crisis this winter because they
stocked up on Russian gas. That buffer is now gone, which means a
looming energy crisis this year. Put another way, time is running out on
Washington’s scheme to defeat the Russians and steal their resources.

There are also the events on the battlefield. The Russians have
encircled the strategic town of Bakhmut. This is the linchpin to what is
called the Zelensky line. If this town falls, then the line of contact
moves rapidly west. It would also rule out any possibility of counter
attacking this spring. There were reports that the Ukrainians were
abandoning the town, but then Zelensky changed course again. Now there
are reports of new units with new Western gear being thrown into the
cauldron.

Clearly, Washington is calling the shots in Kiev, so this change of plan
in Bakhmut could mean there is some new escalation planned. That could
be why Scholz was called in for a private briefing. Maybe the Poles will
be sent into the Western part of Ukraine in order to bring supply lines
closer to the front. Currently, the Ukrainian army is supplied through
Poland using rail lines. Having the Poles set up forward bases in
Ukraine shortens the supply lines.

That would also put NATO troops near the front. The Russians have been
attacking the rail system and power grid all over Ukraine. Would they
attack those rail depots knowing that they are full of Polish troops?
That could give the Kagan cult the excuse to launch World War III. It
sounds insane, but this is what happens when you have a Bronze Age death
cult running imperial policy. No matter how insane the idea, they are
willing to consider it in pursuit of their goal.

The final possibility is that we are seeing the start of the end game.
Unless Washington is prepared to get directly involved in the war, there
is no other possible outcome for Ukraine than defeat. The question is
how to manage this so that Western governments experience the least
amount of agony. Given how Western politics is driven by narrative, this
meeting may signal the start of a new narrative to explain what is
looking like the inevitable demise of Ukraine.
