For as long as anyone can recall, the offer from the American political
system to the typical white person was a choice between a party that
wants to harm you and your interests or a party that will work to
prevent it. It was never explicitly stated this way, but it was always
the subtext to Republican Party marketing. Vote Republican or risk being
subjected to the tender mercies of the Democrats.

Note that the Democratic Party did not market itself this way. They did
make wild claims about the Republicans wanting to do things like bring
back slavery or roll back women’s rights, but they were always couched
in the assertion that the Democrats were going to advance the goals of
their supporters. The choice was between progress and regress, never
stasis as with the Republican messaging.

Since the end of the Cold War, this dynamic has become grotesque. The
Democrat Party invents increasing bizarre goals it seeks to achieve,
things like letting men in dresses chase your kids around the park,
while the Republican messaging has become feebler and more subservient.
Republican messaging has been reduced to “Vote for us so the man in the
dress chasing your kids is not a racist.”

It is clear that the people in the white working and middle class no
longer have any options at the ballot box save for one. That option is
to abandon the party that claims to represent their interest and thus
abandon a system that mocks the very notion of representative
government. Zeroing out the Republican side of the equation is the only
way to break the cycle of madness.

That is the show this week. A big part of it is about how the system
works and why there is no voting your way to a better result. The two
parties, in collusion with the donor class, have rigged the game in such
a way that voting no longer matters, other than to confirm to the
parties that the rubes continue to be fooled. Negating that last part
may be the only peaceful way of initiating a reform cycle.
