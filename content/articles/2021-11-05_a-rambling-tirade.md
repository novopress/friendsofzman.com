One of the unnoticed things about the current crisis is that the people
getting what they want are increasingly angry, while the people getting
worked over by the system are remaining calm and patient, for the most
part. The crazies got what they wanted through the Trump years. They
snarled his administration in a made-up plot and convinced his own party
to sabotage his efforts. This required little effort, as the GOP is just
their dull-witted flunkies.

Then they purged him from the system. The 2020 election should have
signaled the end of the madness. The evil orange man had been removed
from office. The Republicans could crawn back under their beds and the
Democrats could waste everyone’s time with their crackpot ideas. The
media would not have hear every day that they are fake news or the enemy
of the people. Everything was back to how it was. You would think that
they would be celebrating in the streets.

Instead, it has been a year of tantrums and vitriol. The more the
lunatics get, the more they want and the more they want, the angrier
they get. Their response to the mild bit of pushback on Tuesday was to
promise more attacks on normal people. Pelosi promised to ram through
their Build Back Better scheme. Biden promised to fire millions from
their jobs for not worshipping Covid. Of course, these responses are
always accompanied by an endless stream of lies and deceptions.

Of late, the question that keeps coming to mind is how much longer are
we going to put up with these lunatics? The stock response from most is
something about normie just wanting to grill and watch sportsball. It is
certainly true that people will tolerate a great deal as long as their
bellies are full, and they are entertained. It is also true that no tree
grows to the sky, meaning there is a limit to everyone’s patience. The
American Revolution was not about the lack of food or entertainments.

It is not even about the people at the top. The real issue is the
fruitcakes and lunatics that have been unleashed into a daily life. How
can normal people expect to live with the sorts of people in this
<a href="https://twitter.com/niggy_stardust/status/1452006192360853507"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Twitter thread?</a> For ideological
reasons they are making up nonsense about how food is a luxury item. How
long can any sane person put up with people who lie like this? How long
before normal people snap and slap the smug off the moonbat in their
life?

Imagine having to tolerate this <a
href="https://michiganadvance.com/2021/10/24/susan-j-demas-the-soul-crushing-fight-of-parents-battling-right-wing-covid-nihilism/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">stupid shrew</a>? We all have a Covidian
in our life and have had our patience tested by them. This ridiculous
dingbat could not count her boobs twice and get the same number both
times, yet she floats around lecturing the rest of us on vaccinations.
These people are why we had things like the dunking stool and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scold%27s_bridle" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">branks</a>. At some point, even unlimited amounts of
food and sportsball is not going to be enough to tolerate these people.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
