People often join mass movements as a way to replace their own hated
identity with that of the group. They immerse themselves in the movement
or cause, losing themselves in the identity of the group. Their sense of
who they are gets blended with the cause so that they are one with it.
It is why their life is quickly organized around the cause they are in
at the moment. Not everyone does this, of course, but every mass
movement has true believers, people who become one with it.

This is why the true believer reacts to all criticism of the movement as
if it were a physical attack on their person. They treat all opposition
to their cause as a violent threat, because from their perspective, it
is an attack on their person. Once who they are is indistinguishable
from the identity of the group, any criticism of the group becomes a
threat to their very existence. It is why reasoning with a true believer
makes them more belligerent and hostile.

Another consequence of this fusing of identities is that the true
believer tends to project onto others the things he hates or fears about
the group. Since the very nature of the true believer precludes
self-examination, it also precludes a critical examination of the cause
they have joined. For the same reason they look at criticism of the
group as an attack on their person, they cannot criticize the group.
Instead, they project these faults and fears onto some external entity.

A good example is
<a href="https://thebulwark.com/the-paradox-of-trumpist-patriotism/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">this post</a> from the neocon website the
Bulwark. The neocons, of course, have been driven berserk by Trump and
the rise of populism. They were sure their scaly tentacles were so
tightly wrapped around the Republican Party that it was nothing more
than their personal golem. Then Trump comes along and shatters that
certainty by sweeping the primaries. Not only that, but he also pointed
the finger at them as the reason for why things have gone wrong in
America.

This is a good bit of evidence that whatever it was, neoconservatism had
transformed into a weird political cult. The first generation had
practical reasons for the transition from Trotskyists to Buckley
conservatives. They saw that the American Left was getting cozy with the
Soviet Union. It was not so much their flirtation with communism, but
their friendliness with the ancient enemy in the East. The neocons
dropped their own communism and became libertarian Cold War hawks.

The following generations, on the other hand, were not so clever. Bill
Kristol, for example, has been wrong about everything for thirty years.
He thought Dan Quayle would make a good second for Poppy Bush. He though
Sarah Palin would make a good second for John McCain. Quayle and Palin
were decent people trying to do the right thing, but their appeal to
Kristol was that he believed he could outwit them, which meant they were
not the sharpest tools in the toolshed.

Putting that aside, you really see the cult-like aspect in this post. It
is pure projection of neoconservative defects onto their enemy. The
post’s subhead says it all. “Claiming to love America while believing
that it is broken and that many of your fellow citizens are your
enemies.” These are people who spent the last six years claiming that
Trump and his voters need to be exterminated on the grounds that they
are evil. Bill Kristol wants to <a
href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/9/bill-kristol-asks-if-lazy-pockets-of-white-working/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">genocide</a> the “lazy” white working
class.

Later in the post we get this gem, “In his public addresses, President
Biden has made a conscious effort to speak to all Americans. Donald
Trump, by contrast, typically reverts to the language of
us-versus-them…” This is the sort of thing you get from someone who is
no longer engaged with reality. It is also the way a cult member
projects the defects of his cult onto enemies. The hive-minded neocon is
projecting the things he most despises about his cult onto the enemies
of the cult.

The transformation of neoconservatism into this bizarre hyper-violent
subculture raises an interesting set of questions. Was it always a
blood-soaked political cult obsessed with bringing about the end times?
On the other hand, is this what happens when a bespoke identity cult
loses its primary purpose? After all, neoconservatism was built for the
Cold War, so when that ended, their purpose ended. Like a hive who loses
its queen, the remaining members of this cult buzz around in anger.

There is another angle here. The first generation of neoconservatives
went through a period where they aggressively attacked their former
host. It was as if they were trying to purge themselves of the old
identity to make room for the new one. That could be what we are seeing
here. The current neocons are shedding their old conservative skin in
order to grow a neoliberal skin. This will allow them to attach
themselves to what they think is the permanent new order in Washington.

Additional support for this the tone and language in their posts. Note
that in the past they differentiated between “Trumpists” and
conservatives. Increasingly they conflate the terms, using them as
synonyms. Note also they are not trying to reconcile with their old
allies in Conservative Inc. Instead, they have retreated into their own
ghettos while they go through the transformation. The next chapter of
neoconservatism will take place within the neoliberal order, they hope.

It is an interesting phenomenon to behold, if you can avoid being
emotionally drawn in by their projection. Perhaps that is another reason
that cults project their hatreds, fears, and insecurities onto others.
It is a distraction. The endless feverish attacks on alleged enemies
draw the eye away from what is happening in the cult. That old
self-loathing, the desire for self-abnegation, at the root of the true
believer, results in a group behavior that always seeks to distract from
what is happening in the cult.
