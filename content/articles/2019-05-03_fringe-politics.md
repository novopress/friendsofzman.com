I like to mix things up to keep it fresh, so this week I’m doing a show
on some of the more fringe aspects of the dissident right. Even though
these political movements don’t get a lot of discussion, they have had a
lot of influence on outsider politics in America and in Europe. Some of
the things that you hear in alt-right circles, for example, come from
National Bolshevism and Archeofuturism. Even if you are not interested
in signing onto a fringe political movement, knowing something about
them can be useful.

This is a topic I have been looking forward to doing for a while now.
I’ve had some exposure to all of these at one time or another, but I had
to take some time to get reacquainted with much of it. It’s fascinating
to me how some ideologies don’t change all that much. The Third Position
guys, for example, have been pretty much the same since I first
encountered them as a kid. Even though the Cold War is a fading memory,
there are people out there still viewing the world in terms of the old
Left and old Right.

The segment on Archeofuturism is probably the most salient. I’m not
someone who comes from that school of thought, but Guillaume Faye is
probably the one “right-wing” thinker in the last couple of generations
to seriously re-think what it means to be on the Right. He is certainly
one of the few who moved his focus up the great chain of causality from
institutions to biology and culture. Most of the conventional Right has
gone the other way, falling into the gutter of libertarian economics.
Faye is a guy worth reading again.

One administrative note. I did a long interview with the guys at
<a href="https://identitydixie.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Identity Dixie</a> this week and the results will be
posted on their site this upcoming week. I think I will be doing a post
on the topic of Southern Nationalism at some point, but their site has a
lot of interesting stuff on the topic. They did a <a
href="https://identitydixie.com/rebel-yell-128-american-nations-the-ensign-hour/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">podcast</a> with the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_uJZ5PFi-sNvnMk1XMPuw"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ensign Hour</a> guys, a
Canadian nationalist podcast, that was quite interesting. There is a
surprising amount of overlap between Southern nationalism and Canadian
nationalism. If you have time it is worth a listen.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I have been
de-platformed by Spotify, because they feared I was poisoning the minds
of their Millennial customers.
