Sextus Julius Caesar I was the man who killed the Roman Republic. He was
not  *the* Julius Caesar, but he was the man who started the line that
would eventually give us *the* Julius Caesar. In 208 BC, no one could
have possibly known that a man of his line would bring down the
Republic. If they did, he would have been murdered along with all of his
kin. We can never know these things. You just have to hope you get
lucky.

No one could have known that an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obadiah_Bush" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">eccentric school master</a> would found a line whose <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">men would bring about the end</a> of the
American republic.

*Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is “moving forward” on a potential 2016
White House run and it appears more likely he will enter the Republican
field, according to his son, who’s running for office in Texas.*

*George P. Bush told ABC’s “This Week” that his father is “still
assessing” a presidential bid, but suggested it was more likely that he
would seek the White House this time. The ex-governor declined to run
for president in 2012 despite encouragement from Republicans.*

*“I think it’s more than likely that he’s giving this a serious thought
and moving — and moving forward,” said the younger Bush, who is running
for Texas land commissioner.*

*Asked if that meant it was “more than likely that he’ll run,” George P.
Bush responded: “That he’ll run. If you had asked me a few years back …
I would have said it was less likely.”*

*Jeb Bush, the brother of former President George W. Bush and the son of
former President George H.W. Bush, would stand out in what could be a
crowded Republican field in 2016.*

*Bush has headlined fundraisers for Republican candidates and committees
and helped campaigns for governor in Iowa, South Carolina and Nevada,
three of the first four states to hold early presidential primaries.*

*Family considerations could play a factor in his decision.*

*In an interview with The Associated Press this month, Jeb Bush said his
wife, Columba, is “supportive” of a potential presidential campaign and
his mother, former first lady Barbara Bush, was now “neutral, trending
in a different direction.” Barbara Bush declared last year there had
been “enough Bushes” in the White House.*

*“But that doesn’t mean that I don’t understand the challenges that this
brings,” Jeb Bush told the AP. “This is ultimately my decision with as
much consideration as I can to take into account the people that I
really love.”*

*George P. Bush, in the interview aired Sunday, said his family would be
“100 percent” behind his father if he decides to run.*

God help us.
