Maybe it is just me, but there seems to be an edge to everything of
late, like everyone is a little madder about things than normal. I feel
it in myself, which is why I have decided to decouple from the news
entirely next week. I suspect it has something to do with the Jusse
Smollett story. Not in a direct way, as no one is surprised by the
result. Well, the media is pretending to be surprised, but no one
else. This is one of those events where there is the above the waterline
story and a below the waterline story.

The above the waterline part is the fact that everyone knew it was a
hoax and the people in charge bothered to acknowledge it. Usually, these
hoaxes get broomed and the only people following them are the weirdos
who cater to the woke Dirt People. Without Steve Sailer, no one would
know about Haven Monahan. Heck, most people still do not get the
reference, or they have forgotten it, along with the whole story. That
is how good the media is at controlling the minds of most Americans.
Propaganda works.

The below the waterline story is that Smollett is going to get away with
it. Some BoomerCons will wave around this petty charge as vindication,
like they are doing with Trump’s fake wall declaration, but people on
our side know better. If it had been two white guys attacking a black,
they would be facing life in prison. This clown, who cost the city
millions and perpetuated this blood libel against whites, will end up
with probation and a boost in his career. Notice he has not been fired
from his job yet.

A growing anger is the price for people becoming aware of what is
happening to them, but it makes for a tense environment. A lot of
CivNats are slowly realizing they have been conned, duped by people they
trusted. This is not America, at least not the America with laws, rules,
and equal justice. We are a lot closer to where the Russians were 40
years ago than where America was 40 years ago. That is both scary and
infuriating, but that is inevitable as our people wake up from the
American Dream.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I have been
de-platformed by Spotify, because they feared I was poisoning the minds
of their Millennial customers.
