There are no Starbucks in the ghetto, so I have to assume the CEO of
Starbucks hates black people. I suspect most of my neighbors would have
a tough time spending ten bucks for a coffee and muffin, served up by a
snotty lesbian with a face full of fishing tackle. Still, it is not hard
to imagine how
<a href="http://fortune.com/2015/03/16/starbucks-baristas-race-talk/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">this would go in my neighborhood</a>.

*But the executive, who oversees a coffee empire with 4,700 U.S. stores,
has now taken on arguably the most polarizing political debate in the
United States: race relations.*

*Starbucks published a full page ad in the New York Times on Sunday — a
stark, black, page with a tiny caption “Shall We Overcome?” in the
middle, and the words “RaceTogether” with the company logo, on the
bottom right. The ad, along with a similar one on Monday in USA Today,
is part of an
[initiative](http://news.starbucks.com/news/what-race-together-means-for-starbucks-partners-and-customers)
launched this week by the coffee store chain to stimulate conversation
and debate about the race in America by getting employees to engage with
customers about the perennially hot button subject.*

*Beginning on Monday, Starbucks baristas will have the option as they
serve customers to hand cups on which they’ve handwritten the words
“Race Together” and start a discussion about race. This Friday, each
copy of USA Today — which has a daily print circulation of almost 2
million and is a partner of Starbucks in this initiative — will have the
first of a series of insert with information about race relations,
including a variety of perspectives on race. Starbucks coffee shops will
also stock the insert.*

White plutocrats like the people running Starbucks can have
“conversations about race”: because everyone they know is white and has
the same opinions about race. Their conversation about race is more of a
cheer than a conversation. I suppose that’s why they think this is a
great idea.

In more vibrant neighborhoods like mine, there’s no need to have a
conversation about race. Everyone knows the deal. We also know it is
best be polite to one another in order to keep the peace. If the local
coffee shop hires a bitter lesbian and has her lecture the customers
about race, there will be blood.

If Starbucks wants to do something about race relations, how about they
open some shops in my neighborhood. They’ll need to cut the prices and
knock it off with the weird names for things, but maybe the shops in the
rich white people towns can pay a little more for social justice.

That’s never going to happen, of course, because it would require some
skin in the game. It’s much easier to stand on the lawn of the mansion
or in the boardroom lecturing the rest of us from behind a line of
security guards.
