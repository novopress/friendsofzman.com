If you were around in the 1980’s and old enough to have noticed
politics, then you probably recall the smug satisfaction of liberals
when they criticized Ronald Reagan and the people who supported him. You
see, conservatives were uneducated rubes easily fooled by a jocular
actor who took naps during the day. Smart and educated people were not
fooled by this stuff. It was mostly a coping strategy, of course, as
Reagan was wildly popular so liberals could only grumble.

The claim was not entirely without support. For most of the 20th century
it was the Left that could claim intellectual rigor. Smart people went
into various forms of liberal politics and churned out new ideas and
proposals. From the New Deal to the Great Society, liberal intellectuals
drove American politics. It was in the 1980’s when that started to
change, and the right started to be the place where smart people went to
debate the issues of the day and the polices to address those issues.

In fairness, there were very smart people on the Right prior to the
Reagan years, but it was a small club. James Burnham, for example, wrote
his foundational work during the Second World War. Bill Buckley was
challenging the Left in the 1960’s. In other words, there were
conservative intellectuals before the 1980’s. It is just that Reagan’s
success worked to legitimize the right as an intellectual endeavor,
which in turn brought in waves of young smart people.

The truth is the American Left never recovered from the civil rights
era. The arc of American progressivism begins with demands to end
slavery and ends with the demand that fat naked men have a right to wave
their genitals in your face. While it is reasonable to say that the Left
is degenerate and evil, the reason they embrace this stuff is that they
are morons. The Left is now dominated by credentialed idiots who think
being loud and obnoxious is the peak of humans thought.

As is their nature, however, the people who continue to identify as
conservative followed their friends on the Left into idiocy. There was a
time when the flagship publication of conservatism, National Review,
sported some of the smartest and most original thinkers and critics in
the country. That was a long time ago. Today you will find jarringly
stupid posts like this <a
href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/reject-right-wing-marxism/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">one</a>. That post is an echo of this
longer and much dumber <a
href="https://lawliberty.org/book-review/inspiration-should-be-sought-elsewhere/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> in something called Law &
Liberty.

There was a time when a phrase like “right-wing Marxism” would have been
met with howls of laughter. The reason is the term is ridiculous. More
important, there was a time when conservatives knew enough about Marxism
and what it meant to be right-wing to know the term is ridiculous. The
person who posted that item at National Review does not know this. The
author of the source item seems to think the word “Marxism” is just
another word for “bad.”

Putting aside the stupidity of the key phrase, the original article is
riddled with errors that should have been noticed by the editor. An easy
example is his claims about Russell Kirk, who has been forgotten by
modern conservatives. The reason National Review types sent Kirk down
the memory hole is he sided with the paleos. He proudly supported George
Wallace, for example. Kirk was also the Michigan chairman of the Pat
Buchanan campaign.

The author of that Law & Liberty article is either an idiot or a liar.
He clearly does not understand the material. He does not know the
history of the intellectual tradition that he is claiming to defend.
Worse yet, his main argument is that the paleos were unpopular, which is
proof they were wrong. There is no form of conservatism that claims
truth is determined by popular consent. In fact, the rejection of that
idea is the very first principle of conservatism as
[presented](https://kirkcenter.org/conservatism/ten-conservative-principles/)
by Russell Kirk!

This brings us back to where we started. There was a time when
conservatism was a vibrant and dynamic intellectual space. There was
room for Sam Francis to critique Russel Kirk and a place for Mel
Bradford to rebut the claims of Harry Jaffa. Those days are long gone
now as conservatism has suffered from a long brain drain. What has
replaced it is a narrow conformism. Dimwits like Bobby Miller and
Michael Lucchese are now what passes for conservative thought.

Proof that the universe has a sense of humor, this state of affairs was
predicted by many of those old paleos hated by modern conservatives. Sam
Francis observed that Buckley’s movement would inevitably have to
compromise its principles in order to have a place at the table. The
price of admission was accepting the moral claims of the people who
controlled the political system. You could not be a critic of that
system and be a beneficiary of it. Something had to give.

These moronic posts on conservative platforms are the inevitable result
of the necessary brain-drain that started when conservatives joined the
club. Smart people ask questions and asking questions is always a good
way to fall afoul of the prevailing orthodoxy, so conservatism began to
select for the incurious and dull. The long arc of conservatism ended
with morons shrieking phrases like “right-wing Marxism” while they point
at the intellectual debate to their right.
