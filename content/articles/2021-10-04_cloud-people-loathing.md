**Note:** The weekly
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/the-seeds-of-moderate-defeat/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Taki column</a> is up. This one did not
come out very well, but even the best have their off-days. I could not
quite figure out where I wanted to go with the analogy, so it went
nowhere. Maybe I’ll revisit it here this week. The
<a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/posts/434786" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Sunday show</a> is up behind the green door for those
with a soul.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A feature of the ongoing crisis in America is people realizing that
things they assumed to be true are not what they had always assumed. The
so-called red-pilling or awakening is usually related to the egalitarian
issues, but it can also be about general politics, as we saw in 2016.
Many rank-and-file conservatives discovered that professional
conservatives were not what they claimed. Their attacks on Trump and
populism were an awakening for many normal people.

Another part of the great awakening is the realization that things make
much more sense if you start from the assumption that the people in
charge are motivated by a hatred for normal people. The pointless and
punitive measures with regards to Covid has opened a lot of eyes. The
people in charge seem to be sitting around dreaming up ways to hassle
people, using Covid as an excuse. The pandemic has been a two year party
for the sadists among the ruling class.

You really see this with the so-called conservatives, who have evolved
into nothing but a cult of loathing. That loathing is directed at the
sorts of people they used to trick into supporting them. This is most
likely connected, in part, to the fact that so many of the former
suckers have wised up over the last five years. The Trump phenomenon
broke the spell and there is no way the former suckers are going to go
back to being conned by the grifters of Conservative Inc.

The glaring example here is the revolt of the neocons, who broke with
Conservative Inc, and have now migrated back to their old home on the
Left. Jonah Goldberg, who started out in life fetching coffee for the
far-left crank Ben Wattenberg, is pretty much a middle of the road lefty
now. Bill Kristol is openly supporting far-left candidates like Terry
McAuliffe in Virginia. When you see Bush flunkies in bed with Clinton
flunkies, it is not hard to see that conservatism was always a grift.

That is the thing about a grifter. They despise the person they are
trying to scam, which is why they can be so ruthless. The grifter does
not rip-off everyone. They target a mark and then use all of their
powers to harm him, often just for the fun of it. People who have
studied the confidence man have noted that the conman always feels like
he is in the right and the mark somehow deserves it. You see that with
the neocons, who cry out as they strike at the people they conned for so
long.

Another example of this conservative loathing for normal people is [this
post](https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/10/a-small-blow-to-the-defamation-peddlers/)
from the corpulent Kevin Williamson. For a long time, his grift was to
be the common man at National Review, where he wrote about the little
people. Unlike the rest of that crowd, he was not the product of elite
universities and connected families. He was from West Texas and flunked
out of a state college. His job in Conservative Inc. was to be the
populist affirmation of the latest conservative fads.

Conservatives are supposed to “stand athwart” this sort of corruption of
the law by the Left, but here you have Williamson celebrating it. The
reason is Alex Jones is associated with Donald Trump and populism. In
other words, his hatred for the people who used to read him counts for
everything. If it means goofball judges promoting nonsense lawsuits that
undermine public order, Williamson is for it as long as it harms the
people he loves to hate.

Kevin Williamson is a good example of how the loathing of normal people
is linked to a deep self-loathing. He is famously obese. He often looks
like one of those people who paramedics have to use a flatbed truck to
transport to the hospital. The morbidly obese are driven by
self-loathing. They eat to get the momentary hit that comes from high
calorie foods, but this also fuels the self-loathing. The more they eat
the more they hate themselves for it. The morbidly obese have a death
wish.

Another reason that guys like Williamsons and David French, another good
example, are so blatant in their hatred for normal people is they have
always had to play the role of the Dirt Person for their masters in the
rackets. They used to make Williamson, for example, dress like a
rag-picker when he went on television. You see, he was playing the lucky
dirtball, allowed to live in the master’s house, as long as he was a
good boy and did what he was told. It is a degrading existence.

This is why he is obsessed with hating Trump and those associated with
him. The 2016 election put the lie to his existence. He was just a
houseboy for mediocrities like Rich Lowry and Ramesh Ponnuru. Imagine
having to call them sir when out in public and you can see why
Williamson is filled with rage. You also see why he drowns it in
processed foods and invective aimed at normal people. He hates you
because you remind him of why he hates himself and why he *should* hate
himself.

No life is without some purpose and the purpose of these people has been
to open the eyes of normal people about the reality of conservatism.
Millions of people have realized over the last five years that these
people are liars and crooks. Conservatism was always just a con. Like
all conmen, the various characters of Conservative Inc. were motivated
by a deep hatred for their marks. Like the rest of the Cloud People,
they are defined by their loathing for the Dirt People.

It is this awakening that has put those rackets into crisis. Rich Lowry
was finally demoted from his position. Daily management of National
Review has now been outsourced to Bangalore. Massive pay cuts and
layoffs hang over the entire enterprise now that the suckers have
smartened up. A big part of this great awakening is that people are
figuring out that it all makes sense when you realize that the people in
charge hate you. Your only choice is to hate them back.
