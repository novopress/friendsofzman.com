The news brings word that foaming at the mouth lunatic [Keith Olbermann
has been hired by
ESPN](http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/9485482/keith-olbermann-returns-espn-late-night-program).
They plan to stick him on late night and promise he will not talk about
politics. I guess we are supposed to believe that no one else could
possibly fill that time slot so they had to hire a screaming fanatic to
do it. That’s what Olbermann is and that’s what he will be in his new
gig, a screaming fanatic in the mold of Father Coughlin. That’s probably
unfair to fans of Coughlin, as they never passed themselves off as
intellectuals.

Olbermann walks around thinking he is a genius level IQ when he is
probably just about average for the population. That’s because like all
fanatics, he conflates morality with reason. This has always been a
feature of the Left. They see themselves as the anointed and anyone who
does not see that must be stupid or evil. That gives them license to
celebrate their brilliance and do anything they like against their
opponents. The fanatic has no limits on his virtue or his vengeance.
That’s why Olberman is a nut.

Regardless, it is emblematic of what has gone wrong in America. This
idiot keeps getting high paying gigs, despite being a stupid dickhead
that everyone seems to hate. Failing up seems to be the way the
over-class operates. The more you screw up, the higher you climb. It is
only in the wretched world of reality do we see a connection between
performance and remuneration. Get fired from a few sales jobs for being
an asshole and you end up working the drive through. Screw up in
politics or the media and you get rich.
