Imagine someone trying to convince you to do something by arguing that
this thing is in your financial interests. They give you a stock tip,
for example. You check it out and decide to buy some of the stock. In
the following weeks, the stock price collapses, and you lose money.
Obviously, you will not be happy, but you are not going to assume the
guy who gave you the stock tip wanted to harm you. Unless you bought the
stock from him, you will assume he made the same error as you.

Now think about a different scenario in which someone convinces you to
do something because it is the right thing to do. In other words, he is
not appealing to your desire to make money, but your desire to be viewed
as a good person. The deed in this case is donating to some cause. You
check it out and donate, but soon learn that it is a fraud and the
people involved are swindlers. The person who tricked you into giving
money was also in on the scheme.

If we assume the money lost is equal in both cases, you are going to
have much stronger feelings toward the second person than the first
person. One reason is the assumed intent of the two people. The first
guy was trying to help you but was wrong about his stock tip. The second
person wanted to rob you. Even if the first guy was reckless in his
behavior, he was not trying to harm you, but there is no doubt about the
intent of the second guy.

More important, the first person appealed to your greed, while the
second person appealed to your morality in order to trick you. We can
accept some blame when we let our vices get the better of us, as in the
stock tip scenario. You let the idea of free money cloud your judgement.
When someone turns your virtue into a vice, by playing on your good
intentions in order to harm you, it challenges the idea of right and
wrong, which is far worse than simple theft.

This is what comes to mind reading this
<a href="https://www.firstthings.com/article/2023/05/what-ukraine-means"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> in *First Things*. George Weigel
is a well-known neocon and warmonger. The timing of the post is a bit
odd, given that we are in the end phase of the war. The time for making
the “moral case” for yet another war on the world was a year ago. It
suggests the Kagan cult is planning to keep the war on Russia going long
after the Ukraine portion is settled. Weigel has been dispatched to turn
virtue into vice for the suckers of Conservative Inc.

Twenty years ago, almost to the day, Weigel <a
href="https://www.americamagazine.org/issue/428/article/just-war-case-war"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">made</a> the same “moral case” for
launching a preemptive war on Iraq. It you read both posts together, it
is as if he is working from a template. That is because he does work
from a template. When you strip away the moral pretentions, Weigel is
not much of a thinker. His act is to play on your Christian duty or
maybe your patriotic morality. He is not trying to appeal to your reason
with a well thought out argument.

Last year, Eric Sammons at *Crisis Magazine* <a
href="https://www.crisismagazine.com/opinion/the-dangerous-weigel-script"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">dissected</a> the Weigel style. “The
Weigel Script includes: (1) a comparison to Nazi Germany; (2) turning
foreign leaders into cartoon villains; (3) accepting at face value any
and all U.S. intelligence that puts the proposed adversary in the worst
light; (4) making non-falsifiable assertions about a dire future if the
U.S. doesn’t intervene; and (5) ignoring any potential negative
consequences of U.S. intervention.”

You see it in the *First Things* post. He even adds in the now famous
meme associated with the neocons. “For no reason at all” Russia invaded
Ukraine. In this case, he surely knows that what he is saying is a lie.
Twenty years ago, when he was selling the death of Iraqi children as a
cost worth paying to stoke his moral vanity, he could claim ignorance
about the lies underneath the claims about Iraq. Lots of people assumed
George Bush was sincere about the WMD business.

In the case of the Ukraine war, Weigel knows he is lying, and he
probably knows that the readers know he is lying, but he lies anyway.
You are not supposed to think about the facts, because it is your moral
duty to oppose evil! As long as you accept his claims about Putin being
yet another Hitler, the lies do not matter. Like the guy from the second
example at the start of this post, Weigel is trying to turn your virtue
into a vice, and he is doing it with knowledge of forethought.

The thing is, Weigel is not an exception. Conservative Inc. has always
produced odious carbuncles who prey on the decency of normal people.
Weigel is getting long in the tooth, so his act has been moved from the
main stage. Guys like David French have taken up the mantle of moralizer
for the cause. He now claims to be the keeper of the true conservative
flame, while he writes about himself at the New York Times, the supposed
enemy of conservatism.

All of this brings us to a question. Who is the real enemy? Is it the
self-described leftist who maintains an alien moral code? Is it the
alleged friend and ally who uses your moral code against you? The former
thinks he is right and thinks you would be wise to agree with him. The
latter knows you are right but uses that to trick you into going along
with what is wrong. The former may support evil things like gender
identity, but the latter seeks to make you evil.

What all of this gets to is that before conservatism and its
neoconservative core are pushed into the dustbin of history, we need to
think about how a new moral order resists this form of trickery. The
trouble with conservatism is it never thought much about inoculating
itself against these sorts of people and instead just accepted them as a
feature, rather than a bug. Whatever replaces conservatism must prevent
people like George Weigel from gaining a purchase.
