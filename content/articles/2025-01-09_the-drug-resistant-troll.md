Mark Twain said, “There is no such thing as a new idea. It is
impossible. We simply take a lot of old ideas and put them into a sort
of mental kaleidoscope. We give them a turn and they make new and
curious combinations.” This is generally true, but occasionally
something new comes along. The printing press is the best example. In
fact, it was a revolutionary novelty. Much of what ails the modern world
in some way traces its roots to the printing press.

The internet is another great novelty. Sure, the internet is, as Twain
said, a lot of old ideas in a new combination. Sending letters to people
over the internet is just a modern version of sending letters through
the mail. Social media is a crowded public place where people strain to
understand one another. Quantity has a quality of its own, however, and
in the case of the internet, hooking billions together has created
something that is different from its antecedents.

One example of this is the
<a href="https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=19531" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">digital grifter</a>. These are people who have many of
the qualities we associate with conmen, but they also have qualities
unique to the digital age and therefore could not exist before it. The
analog grifters did not seek unrestricted attention, because they feared
getting exposed. The digital grifter lives on attention and has no fear
of being caught. In some cases, being labeled a grifter is viewed as an
asset to the overall grift.

The difference between the digital grifter and the old fashioned grifter
who may ply his trade online is that the money aspect of the grift is
secondary. The old fashioned grift is all about separating the mark from
his money. The digital grifter is not directly trying to scam people out
of money. Instead, he wants a crowd that will operate as social proof
for others who may buy something from him or sign up for a service like
his YouTube channel, which is heavily monetized.

A good example of this is James Lindsay, the buffoonish “anti-woke”
crusader who spends his days offending as many people as possible. He
started out as a garden variety anti-Christian bigot, but that market
was overserved, so he moved on to opposing “woke” nonsense in the
academy. This got him a bunch of attention, so he expanded his anti-woke
campaign to cover everyone. The Framers are now woke and Karl Marx was a
woke crypto-Christian.

By making himself a public nuisance, he gets lots of attention, which
brings him money through subscriptions, monetization and invites to
events where other public nuisances do their act to the suckers. What he
has done is make himself into a version of Mike Cernovich, a pioneer in
using Twitter to troll himself into a career. Instead of pretending to
be a lifestyle expert, Lindsay pretends to be a student of left-wing
ideology and the champion of the fools who believe him.

The professional troll is a genuinely new thing made possible by the
novelty of the internet, which makes it possible for a man and his phone
to irritate millions of people with the push of a few buttons. While the
public nuisance is not new, his elevation to a public figure is a
novelty. In the analog age, Nick Fuentes was selling used cars and James
Lindsay was that guy in accounting who talked about model trains. In
this age they are getting rich as annoying weirdos.

This is leading to another novelty. The digital platforms that made
these people possible are now transforming to encourage them. The
Twitter monetization scheme is based on the number of people who engage
with your post. The monetized users get paid for getting your attention
and the best way to get attention is to be controversial, so it is not
hard to see where this is heading. It is why Musk reinstated Fuentes. He
may not get monetized, but his opponents do get paid to make noise.

Mark Zuckerberg just announced that he is cancelling his army of Indian
content moderators and going to a group-sourced system like Twitter. The
reason for this is moderation is bad for the professional troll.
Community notes, however, is great for the professional troll, as it
brings them even more attention. In effect, the group-sourced moderation
encourages the sorts of behavior that moderation was intended to
suppress, thus generating more of it.

It is why the “For You” tab on Twitter is worthless. It is filled with
accounts that are designed to maximize attention. Many of them are bots
that post and repost the same material to game the engagement system.
There is a tragedy of the commons going on with Twitter. This is when
many people enjoy unfettered access to a finite, valuable resource, like
your attention. They will tend to overuse it. For Twitter, it means
people retreating to a narrow group they follow.

It remains to be seen if the social aspects of the internet can exist as
a massive version of daytime television. There is a novelty to it and
each version of the troll brings some new way of being a troll. There is
a limit to everything, however, and we are already seeing a recycling of
the trolls. James Lindsay ripped off
<a href="https://x.com/restoreorderusa/status/1877079251888882140"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Vox Day</a>, who was on the anti-woke
stuff when Lindsay was busy insulting Christians. The “groypers” are
just a dumber version of the “stormies” created by Andrew Anglin.

Maybe this phase runs its course, like Hollywood reboots. After a few
more turns of the wheel, people develop the mental armor to ignore the
genre entirely. Starved of what it needs most, attention, the troll then
withers and dies. On the other hand, maybe they kill off the big social
media platforms as people retreat to private spaces. We are already
seeing signs of this with the kooks stomping off to Bluesky. The great
disaggregation of the internet will make the professional troll
impossible.

Of course, the digital grifter and its crude variant, the professional
troll, are novelties of this age, so it means their demise, if there is
one, will be a novelty as well. New problems often require new
solutions. Given that these people are unemployable in the normal sense,
they will no doubt be like a drug-resistant virus, mutating with each
eradication effort. Like those afflicted by herpes, the internet may
never rid itself of the infection known as the professional troll.
