**Note:**
<a href="https://schoonercreekfarm.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Schooner Creek Farm</a> is in a legal battle with the
corrupt mayor of the City of Bloomington. The city has allowed (probably
encouraged) Antifa street gangsters to harass these people in order to
ruin their business. I met Sarah Dye last winter and she is very nice
person. She and her family are just trying to live and mind their own
business, but they have been set upon by well-funded gangsters. If you
have a few bucks to spare, donate <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> or

When you tour around crazy land, one thing that jumps out is that these
people are in denial about what has been happening. The stories about
the election corruption, the few you will find on these sites, are just
excuses to launch into paranoid theories about their old nemesis, Donald
Trump. Otherwise they are slobbering over the corrupt stooge who will
soon be installed in the White House. One gets the sense that the
establishment is a little worried about what they have done.

The Republicans appear to be in a panic. Like their masters on the Left,
they just assumed everyone hated Trump as much as they hated him. They
were looking forward to a Trump loss, but holding the Senate by a seat
or two. This would allow them to keep working the old grift on normal
people. “You better support us or the bogeyman will come and make you
socialism!’ You can tell they had this old scam all polished and ready
to go for another round of grift whitey.

Things have gone sideways for them. There is a full-on revolt against
the GOP by their voters, which could cost them the senate. Compounding
matters is you have odious carbuncles like <a
href="https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/12/03/romney-trumps-election-fraud-claims-damaging-america-biden-will-be-president-january-20/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mitt Romney</a> carrying on
like leftists. No decent person should support a party that tolerates a
duplicitous traitor like Romney. Then the senate GOP stabbed their
voters in the face by giving away half a million green cards to India. A
thank you for Kamala Harris, probably.

America is about to descend into one-party rule like you see in all
third world countries, which is what happens when you import the people
of the third world. California is more like Mexico now than historic
America. This is fine in a state, as people can just move to another
state. When that happens in a country, people cannot just pickup and
move, so things get a bit more complicated. Our rulers are realizing
that the old Punch and Judy act is not going to work in New America.

Conservative Inc., always behind the times, because they are always
focused on following the Left around, did the old coordinated hit piece
on Lin Wood. They first had a flunky post a story on <a
href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/12/02/records-lin-wood-decades-voted-donated-democrats-including-barack-obama-david-perdues-2014-opponent/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Breitbart</a>, then the more
“sober minded” poohbahs of the racket <a
href="https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/the-post-election-madness-gets-worse/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">piled on</a> with their own <a
href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/12/the-conspiracy-theory-that-could-hand-joe-biden-the-senate/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hit pieces</a>. It is the old
game of one guy lies and the rest swear to it that they used on Pat
Buchanan a million years ago. Back then they accused him of being an
anti-Semite. This time they are using the D-word.

The amusing part of this is seeing the comment section of Breitbart
erupt in revolt against the post. The old gags are not working now. The
readers of National Review are all in nursing homes, so they are unable
to respond. A mental barrier has collapsed and these people are suddenly
instinctively suspicious of the people and outlets they used to trust to
do their thinking for them. It would take a heart of stone not to enjoy
the suffering of Conservative Inc and the GOP right now.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Deezer</a>, for our European haters and <a
href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-z-blog-power-hour?refid=stpr"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stitcher</a> for the weirdos.
YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
below.

For sites like this to exist, it requires people like you chipping in a
few bucks a month to keep the lights on and the people fed. It turns out
that you can’t live on clicks and compliments.
<a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/the-z-blog"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Five bucks a month</a> is not
a lot to ask. If you don’t want to commit to a subscription, make a one
time donation. Or, you can send money to: Z Media LLC P.O. Box 432
Cockeysville, MD 21030-0432. You can also use <a
href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=UDAS2Q8JYA6CN&amp;source=url"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PayPal</a> to send a few
bucks, rather than have that latte at Starbucks. Thank you for your
support!

**Promotions:** The good folks at
<a href="https://alaskachaga.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer"

readers of this site. You just click on the
<a href="https://alaskachaga.us/discount/ZMAN" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">this link</a> and they take care of the rest. About a
year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
