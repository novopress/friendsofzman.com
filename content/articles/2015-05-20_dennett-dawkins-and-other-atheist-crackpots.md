Right after Penn Jillette went bonkers and took up atheism as his cause,
he was on Red Eye making the case for his new religion. Like all
converts, he was proselytizing because he was full of doubt. Logically,
the reason people try to recruit is for confirmation. If scads of other
sensible people are signing up for the cause, the cause must be a good
thing. So, he was trying to get the others on the panel with him to go
along with his new cause.

He also employed a little trick I suppose has become popular with the
atheist movement. It works like this. If you cannot or will not fully
embrace the belief in a living god, then you are an atheist. This is an
attempt to widen the pool and normalize atheism by declaring it the
default position.

In other words, left to their own devices, humans will not believe in
the supernatural and instead will embrace the pure reason of atheism. I
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_God_Go" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">guess that means wearing dildos on their head and
fighting otters. Or maybe it means dating transexuals</a>. Regardless,
the implication is that religion is a made up thing with out any basis
in the natural world. The fact that this is provably false does not
factor into the equation.

Penn Jillette is a fine entertainer and a lot smarter than most people
in the entertainment rackets, but he is full of baloney. Indifference to
religion and the supernatural is exactly that, indifference. I don’t
believe in God, but I don’t *disbelieve* either. Logically, I can never
*know* if there is or there is not a God or gods or some other
supernatural force at the heart of existence. I know I can’t know and
have no strong beliefs about the matter.

Atheists are certain or at least they claim to be certain. I doubt that,
but even taking them at face value, they claim to know that which cannot
be known, which means they *believe*. Atheism is just another mass
movement with its own set of beliefs. One of those beliefs is that the
pious atheist must make war on the Christians. Like those annoying
people giving away copies of The Watchtower, atheists make being a
public nuisance the highest calling.

Anyway, this showed up in my twitter feed the other day.

The link goes to <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">this Salon interview</a> the atheist
crackpot Daniel Dennet and the alleged end of religion. Dennett is a
great example of how someone can be brilliant in one area and a total
loon in most others. Noam Chomsky is (was?) a great linguist, but he is
otherwise nutty as a fruitcake, indulging in all sorts of deranged
theories.

That Dennett interview reads like the sort of stuff you find from
survivalist websites. The final reckoning is coming and you better be
prepared!!! He so desperately wants to be right that any scrap of data
that can be interpreted as proof is waved around like the missing link.
In the end, he just comes off like a madman struggling to keep it
together.

For the most part, eccentric old coots like Dennett are harmless and
often entertaining. His lectures are probably great fun, even when he
slips into his crazy talk. In my student years, the best teachers were
those mad old guys who no longer cared about convention and simply said
what was on their minds. They made the material interesting.

The trouble is these crackpots are not always harmless. Dawkins and
Dennett have argued for banning religion by force. Dennett argued in his
book *Breaking the Spell* for removing children from parents who are
religious, which is most parents. Specifically he advocates the end of
privacy laws and religious liberty so the state can raise children free
from religion.

Dawkins, of course, thinks it is OK for the state to gather up the unfit
and exterminate them so none of this should be surprising. Celebrity
atheists seem to care as much for being offensive as they do about
atheism. There’s reason to believe that the attraction of atheism is it
lets these guys be an ass in public.

Over 50 years ago Whittaker Chambers exposed the reality of Utopians
like Dawkins and Dennett in <a
href="http://whittakerchambers.org/2012/03/17/big-sister-is-watching-you/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">his great take down of Ayn Rand</a>. In
the end, all of these theories end up in a bloodbath.That’s because the
Utopians hate humanity. Humans are irrational and messy, which means
human society will be irrational and messy. Utopians hate that so they
inevitably conclude that the way to paradise is to kill the humans.
