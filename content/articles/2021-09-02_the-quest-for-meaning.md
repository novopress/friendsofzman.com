When you are living through an age, it is very difficult to see the
currents with which the age will be identified. Few people living in the
Jazz Age would have guessed they were living in the Jazz Age. In this
age, society is whipsawed by one trend after another, so it seems
impossible to know which one will be remembered. Maybe this is the
geriatric age where aging Baby Boomers ruled the day. Perhaps the
democratic age, where mob rule plunged the West into darkness and chaos.

One option may be the age of meaning. This is the time when people are
always searching about for meaning and purpose in their lives. They turn
the trivial into all-important moments, so they can pretend to be in a
struggle. They invent victims of imaginary oppression so they can play
the white knight. Every crisis, it turned into a crusade that quickly
takes on the trappings of religion. Ours is an age where everyone is on
a vision quest and they force the rest of us to play along.

For example, lost in all of the handwringing about Afghanistan is how
some became emotionally attached to a place they ignored for two
decades. Suddenly, getting our “allies” out was a holy mission. They
spent all day [on-line
playing](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/08/afghanistan-digital-dunkirk-defense-contractors-combat-vets-whatsapp/)
“digital Dunkirk” as if they were really doing something heroic. All of
a sudden, the media was full of stories from people who claimed to
working to get their friends out of the country. Of course, those
friends were always heroic Afghans, not Americans.

This quest for meaning was not limited to LARP’ing on-line. Two
[congressmen](https://apnews.com/article/business-evacuations-kabul-islamic-state-group-9aa28ed934ac7a00e5982dafeab84c84)
flew over there against the wishes of the government in order to play
hero. They were not satisfied with making noises about it on the House
floor. They had to be in the middle of the action. Rep. Markwayne Mullin
of Oklahoma decided to [play Rambo](https://archive.is/wQZIv) and went
over to personally rescue people. These pointless and foolish acts are
driven by a need to be seen as men with a purpose beyond the role they
play.

Of course, for close to two years we have been hit by a tsunami of this
from women claiming they are in the “front lines” of Covid. Just look at
the language. They imagine they are in real trenches fighting real
monsters. When it started, every nurse and doctor went on-line every day
to tell us how exhausted they were, as if they were rescuers working day
and night to save people from a collapsed building. Many got swept up in
their fantasies on-line for the same reason.

The main reason the Covid panic is not old news is the people swept up
in the cause cannot let go of it. For many, this was the first time in
their life they woke up in the morning with a sense of purpose. There
are nefarious reasons behind the government response, but it is aided
and abetted by the quest for meaning. There are many more people who
want to believe the stories are true than those who are offended by the
assault on their liberty by the state in response to the problem.

The best way to see this quest for meaning is in things that are not
driven by a sense of crisis, but by history.
[Here](https://archive.ph/1a2GA) is the ridiculous governor of Virginia
inserting himself and his co-religionists into the history books. They
get to feel like heroes for righting a past wrong, that was probably not
wrong. The facts are not important. They need to be part of the long
gone struggle. Since the line for the Emmett Till ride is way too long,
they picked a different event to exercise their quest for meaning.

This is one reason events like the civil right movement are talked about
as if they happened yesterday. Part of it is nostalgia, for sure, but a
big part of it is a secondhand nostalgia by people who have no direct
connection to the events. Instead, they seek to fill the need for
meaning and purpose in their present lives with fantasies about having
experienced emotionally important events of the shared past. This allows
them to feel like they are part of the struggle from the safety of home.

Bourgeoise restlessness is not a new thing. This desire to do something
important seems to be the result of leisure. Young men from good homes
have gone off to seek adventure since there have been young men from
good homes. We live in an age in which large swaths of the population
are idle. Poverty is no longer a threat, as even the poor have more than
they need. In one respect, the quest for meaning in a post-scarcity
phenomenon driven by an excess of middle-class people.

Another driver though is the devastation wrought by liberal democracy.
Social capital in the form of family and community has been used to fire
the great engines of the technological state. The transactional
replacements, on-line community, social media groups and mass media, are
a poor substitute. Like emergency meal replacements, manufactured
community can keep you going for a while, but it is a constant reminder
of the loss of the real thing, as well as a poor substitute.

At the end of the *Time Machine*, the protagonists realizes that the
future he witnessed was not the failure of man, but the result of his
success. “It is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual
versatility is the compensation for change, danger, and trouble.” Once
those challenges were conquered, there was no need for the sort of men
who rush to the sound of danger. Over time those types faded away and
were replaced with the type who easily lived a carefree life as food.

We are learning a similar lesson. Like all living things, humans are
wired to do what is necessary to reach sexual maturity. What has always
made man unique is the desire to live beyond that point. To look into
the heavens for purpose and then manifest that purpose on earth for the
benefit and admiration of our people. The dream may be small or
grandiose, but it is the dream that gives meaning to life. We are not
meant to live in adult daycare centers, marking our days consuming the
latest products.

Perhaps the tech overlords will make the virtual quest for meaning good
enough to keep the species going for a while longer. We will plug into
the machine and have our dreams made true by an algorithm. Maybe we
simply make ourselves insane in the increasingly chaotic quest for
meaning. Whatever happens, there is a good chance that people look back
at this age and know that we were spoiled for choice in the material
realm but starved for choice in the spiritual realm.
