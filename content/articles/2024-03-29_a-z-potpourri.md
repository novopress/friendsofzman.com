It is appropriate that on this Good Friday I have carried your questions
up the hill to my studio and answered them in the podcast. Lots of good
ones this time. No questions about Easter, which was not a surprise, as
I do not do a lot on religion. Putting the show together, it occurred to
me that we will soon see a push to remove Good Friday from the federal
calendar of holidays.

Easter has already been greatly minimized. When I was a kid, spring
break was always before or after Easter. The schools did an Easter show
where the little kids were dressed up in silly outfits to entertain the
parents. We also made Easter baskets and colored eggs in school, which
is banned now. I think the Easter basket tradition has pretty much gone
away entirely at this point.

The current war on the phrase “Christ is King” is a no doubt the first
shots in the coming war on the remains of public Christianity. If they
manage to make public professions of Christian faith “antisemitic” then
it will not be long before Republican governors are banning all displays
of Christianity in the public square. It may sound crazy, but most of
what is normal today was lunacy just a few years ago.

For now, at least, I hope everyone has a blessed Good Friday and Easter
weekend with your friends and family. For the Orthodox readers, you will
have to wait another month this year, but that is how it goes some
years. Catholics, of course, will be saying a special thanks for the
Episcopal Church. It is a reminder that no matter how terrible things
have gotten for Catholics, it can always get worse.
