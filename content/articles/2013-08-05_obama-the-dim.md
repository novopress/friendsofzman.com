I’ve taken to calling Obama “Obumbles” because it infuriates my liberal
friends. Liberals have an emotional need to believe they are the
smartest people in the room, so causally accusing their hero of being a
dimwit offends them greatly. It is the hangover from the “scientific
socialism” days when the Left swore their preferred arrangements were
the natural order. In a better time, true believers would justify their
actions by claiming they were doing God’s will. Today, Progressive
fanatics believe reason is on their side.

Anyway,
<a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/nrd/articles/353797/front-man"

touches on that a bit. Obama is supposed to be the smartest man in the
room. He may have an above average IQ, I don’t know. Steve Sailer thinks
his test scores were probably high average at worst and most likely
above average. That’s not enough, of course. The Unibomber was a genius.
Mao was probably genius or at least very shrewd. Personality is the hand
that wields IQ. In the case of Obama, the personality is one that is
disinterested and lazy.

I would add that Obama is emblematic of the modern meritocracy.
Accumulating credentials stands in place of accumulating
accomplishments. Starting a business takes courage. Making it successful
is hard work. Getting an MBA is relatively easy and it pays much better.
The result is we have a lot of MBA-toting people who cannot run a
lemonade stand and a shortage of honest entrepreneurs. A fair number of
those credentialed professionals could never run a small business or
dare try to start one.

That’s one side effect of managerialism. Getting credentials is a
straight forward process with fairly clear instructions. If you have
above average test scores, it means going to a good college and doing
what you are told for four years. This opens the doors to elite society.
Since the number of people meeting the minimum threshold exceeds the
number of seats, the meritocracy quickly becomes a game of who you know
and how to game the system. The result is a lot of credentialed idiots
running around elite society.

Maybe that is self-correcting or maybe it does not matter. How much
damage does a John Kerry really cause? Obama is president and he has
proven to be fairly harmless. The bigger issue is that the ruling class,
which depends on the ranks of the managerial class for talent, because
incredibly narrow. The strivers at the bottom are motivated to emulate
the people at the top, because that appears to be the path to success.
Over time, the diversity of thought falls to zero. Everyone thinks and
says the same things.

This happened with the Chinese exam system. Initially, it was a great
way to find and cultivate talent. In time, the people entering the
system saw that emulating those in the system was the golden ticket. The
reason is the people in the system selected for people who would
reinforce their position within the system. A few spins of this wheel
and the imperial administration was staffed with men who only knew
esoteric stuff like lines from old poetry and calligraphy. Something
similar is happening to America.
