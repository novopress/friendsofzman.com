Imagine you are presented with evidence of some sort, maybe pictures of
a crime scene or some sort of accident. You see all of the physical
evidence and you are given three stories to explain what you see. Each
version is presented by a person who comes into the room to give their
theory of the event. What we know about human nature tells us that you
will agree with the best storyteller. Even if his story requires some
leaps of logic.

Humans have been telling each other stories since we acquired language.
Much of our social activity is story telling. When you go to a party,
everyone there tells each other stories about their lives, their
experiences, current events and so on. Some people are better at
storytelling than others. These people tend to get invited to more
social events, because they are entertaining and therefore pleasing.
Even if they polish the apple a bit, people still like a good
storyteller.

This is most obvious in politics. Ronald Reagan was famous for his
short, pithy stories he would tell audiences on the stump. Sometimes
they were just funny and other times they had a point. In the latter
case, that point had something to do with some larger political point he
was making. In the former case the story relaxed the audience and made
them more open to his pitch. A man who can tell a good story is always
someone we feel we can trust, even if we disagree with him.

Storytelling can be a highly effective form of logic. A persuasive
storyteller will start with a set of objective facts. These are things
that even a skeptical audience will accept as being true. Then the
speaker provides a narrative to explain those facts and tie them to some
cause, like a person or group of people. The narrative is presented in
such a way that it appears to be the simplest and most likely
explanation. For the listener, there is not obvious reason to dispute
the conclusion.

This is a form of abductive reasoning. The conclusion is not proven in
the sense that all other explanations have been eliminated. It is not
proven in a scientific sense in that the causes are demonstrated to
result in the stated conclusion. There is some doubt that the causal
relationship is true, but it seems to be true and there is no obvious
proof that it is not true. If the narrative is presented by a persuasive
and charismatic speaker, then the listener is disinclined to question
the conclusion.

The writer Ben Novak wrote a <a
href="https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780739192245/Hitler-and-Abductive-Logic-The-Strategy-of-a-Tyrant"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">book</a> explaining how Adolf Hitler was
able to use the power of narrative to persuade the German people. For
those looking for the short version, Greg Johnson reviews it <a
href="https://counter-currents.com/2019/12/ben-novaks-hitler-abductive-logic/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>. The key to Hitler’s success as
a politician was his ability to reframe events in such a way that
changed how people viewed those events and the people involved in those
events. Hitler changed the way in which people interacted with their
world through his speeches.

Getting back to the example of three people trying to explain images
from what looks like a crime scene, the reason you will go with “the
best explanation” is that your brain has an idea of what the best answer
is before you hear the stories. If you hear three dry presentations,
then you will pick the one that matches the one in your head. On the
other hand, if one is presented by a great storyteller and he takes you
on a journey to an entirely new conclusion, your mental model will
change.

Take a step back and the three great ideologies of the last century were
basically narratives that framed how people experienced politics. The
communist narrative was a story of class struggle. The workers versus
the capitalists. The liberal democratic narrative was the story of
political struggle. The people versus the powerful interests that rule
every society. Fascism was the story of national struggle, the people
versus the internationalists who run the global economy.

The point of all this is that human beings have evolved to understand
the world through a mental framework. We have a conception of how the
world works and we process information through that framework. That
framework is the product of our upbringing, our experiences and the
culture in which we live. It is not a permanent part of our
consciousness that forms and remains static. It evolves and therefore it
can be altered by new experiences, like a great story from a great
speaker.

We see this in the current election cycle. Gavin Newsome, the governor
of California, <a
href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3715468-newsom-democrats-getting-destroyed-on-messaging/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">says</a> his party is in trouble because
they are “getting crushed on narrative.” It is not the economy or
culture; their problem is they have not presented a “compelling
alternative narrative” to the Republicans. No one can tell you what the
Republican narrative is, but he is sure it must be better. How else can
one explain why voters appear to be moving against the Democrats next
week?

This incredible <a
href="https://www.ft.com/content/837c3863-fc15-476c-841d-340c623565ae"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">op-ed</a> in the Financial Times lays the
blame for inflation at the feet of the storytellers, rather than
economic policy. You see, corporations are taking advantage of inflation
to raise prices higher than necessary. They can do this because “the
power of storytelling has conditioned consumers to accept price rises.”
You see, “consumers seem to be buying stories that seem to justify price
increases, but which really serve as cover for profit margin expansion.”

What those two examples suggest is that the great promoters of liberal
democracy think the tenets of liberal democracy are nonsense. The
politicians think people are morons who will fall for a good story,
rather than vote their interests. The economists think consumers are not
swayed by prices but by irrational beliefs. The premise of liberal
democracy is that people understand their interests. If given the chance
in a democratic system or a market economy, they will express those
interests.

In reality, people will go along with that which keeps them in good
standing with their fellows, even if it is against their interests. It
is why a good storyteller can be so effective in liberal politics. He
can get the crowd nodding along. Each member sees those around him
agreeing to the pleasing story. Even if the story is clearly against his
interests, he will justify nodding along with it. After all, every human
brain has a narrative of sacrifice built into it at a young age.
