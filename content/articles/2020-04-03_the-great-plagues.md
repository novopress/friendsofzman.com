The great role of pathogens in human affairs is one of those things that
had largely been forgotten, at least by the general public. In the West,
it has been a couple of generations since a pestilence gave us a good
scare. The Hong Kong flu was the last time people really worried about
the invisible death. Even that was pretty mild, compared to past
pandemics. You have to go back to the 1950’s to find an invisible killer
that got the attention of the public. That’s almost three generations
ago.

The fact is though, the invisible killer has been a part of the human
story since there has been a human story. People suddenly coming down
with some unknown ailment and dying in volume is as much of the human
story as anything. A fair bit of our superstitions have probably been
driven by such events. If you cannot come up with a natural explanation
to events, you come up with a supernatural explanation. That fear of the
supernatural got constant exercise throughout human history.

That may be what we are seeing with The Great Madness. It is that old
fear of the unknown, not exercised for several generations, suddenly
being turned on by the threat of the Chines flu. In the past, people
knew how to control this fear and rulers knew the danger of succumbing
to it. Modern people are now like teenagers discovering the opposite
sex. Our fear hormones are in overdrive and we have no ability to
control and channel them. Hence the great panic we see today.

There’s also the fact that we have conquered nature, for the most part.
Even things like hurricanes and earthquakes are not much of a threat.
Sure, a hurricane can knockout New Orleans, but everyone understands
what was really going on there. That disaster was due to man not
respecting that nature does distribute her gifts equally. Natural
disasters may knock down some buildings, but they are quickly rebuilt.
Increasingly, our buildings are resistant to the best Mother Nature can
throw at us.

Even when it comes to pestilence, humans have been taking the fight to
Mother Nature in a big way. We are probably a generation away from
conquering diseases like cancer, at least the most common forms.
Genetics could very well allow us to overcome lots of other natural
disorders that shorten our lifespans and diminish our lives. The lack of
great plagues seems like proof that the days of such things are
numbered. Maybe this virus is a reminder that Mother Nature has plenty
of fight left in her.

That said, this pandemic is a piker compared to the past. The Swine flu,
which hardly anyone remembers, despite happening just a decade ago, had
twice the body count of the Chinese flu in the United States. There’s
still time, but in the grand scheme of things, this pandemic is never
going to be on the list of great plagues. The best chance of it being
remembered is if the economic fallout is such that people remember for
generations that we tried shutting down the world over a virus.

That’s probably the most interesting aspect of pandemics. They often
leave their mark in how they shape human events. How different would our
world be if Athens never suffered a plague and went on to defeat the
Peloponnesian League? How about if Justinian was able to reconstitute
the Roman Empire? It’s impossible to know, but most likely we are what
we are because of these plagues. They not only alter the timeline, but
they cull the herd in ways that are felt for many generations.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
