A unique feature of this age is the fact that our societies are largely
controlled by what we call the media. It was not that long ago when the
term “the media” did not exist as a commonly understood concept. There
were newspapers, books, and pamphlets, but they were called newspapers,
books, and pamphlets. The concept of “the media” is a product of the
20th century.

These days, the media is not a collection of discreet communication
entities but more of a subculture that hangs over society like smog.
There are thousands of people who call themselves journalists, for
example, who do not work for a journal or even have full-time employment
at a newspaper. They are part of the media and speak of themselves as if
they are in a righteous subculture or mass movement.

That is the way to think of it. The people in this thing we call the
media operate like people in a religious cult or movement. This is why
there is so little diversity of opinion in the media now, compared to
just a generation ago. In a holy cause, there is no tolerance for those
who question the cause. The people in this thing called the media are a
priestly class who see their role as moral enforcers.

That is the show this week. It is a rumination on the media that came to
mind as I was driving home late last night. The show covers why people
join the media and why they are unable to square their activism with
reality. Of course, I also talk about who really controls the media.
This is the surprise ending. It turns out that the media is a
consequence of a different process in our society.
