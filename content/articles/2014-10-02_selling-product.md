Conservative Inc. is term that turns up on the Right. The reason is they
use politcs to sell stuff to people, rather than effect public policy.
Michelle Malkin, a nice women, has made a tidy living repeating mindless
platitudes on TV. She’s just a spokesmodel for Conservative Inc. Her job
is to move product. She does that through TV appearances, blogging,
radio, Twitter and so forth. Ann Coulter also churns out books and
columns aimed at selling Ann Coulter, which also sells TV shows, radio
spots, etc.

Another less obvious one is the consultancy rackets. Karl Rove has made
himself millions dispensing bad advise to GOP candidates. The big money
though is in selling hope so his army of fellow consultants can get paid
by campaigns. Getting your buddies to tell National Review readers that
Ed Gillespie has a prayer in his Senate race, means more money for Ed
Gillespie to spend on consultants, ad buyers, pollsters, etc. It’s a lot
like how the stock market used to work. They called it the churn.

*The new <a
href="http://www.quinnipiac.edu/images/polling/nj/nj10022014_n673mdw.pdf"
rel="nofollow">Quinnipiac poll</a> of the New Jersey Senate contest
shows Jeff Bell only 11 points down to Cory Booker, 51 to 40 percent,
among likely voters. It goes without saying that a race can move a dozen
points in the final five weeks of a campaign—especially when a little
known challenger (but one who’s well-regarded by those who do know of
him) is taking on a pro-Obama incumbent who’s barely above 50 percent in
an anti-Obama, anti-incumbent year. (<a

rel="nofollow">Obama’s approval</a> in New Jersey is hovering around 41
percent.)*

*But take a further look at the poll results. Booker leads Bell, 51-40.
Seventy-six percent of Booker supporters and 84 percent of Bell
supporters say their mind is made up. Do the math. Among those whose
mind is made up, Booker leads Bell 39 to 34 percent.*

*So Booker’s hard lead over Bell is a mere 5 points. He’ll outspend Bell
over the next month. But money can’t buy you love. Sometimes, it can’t
even buy you votes. If New Jersey flips in November, we’ll remember this
Quinnipiac poll as Jeff Bell’s fire bell in the night.*

First off, it is obvious click bait. I saw it on Drudge so it means a
few million hits on The Weekly Standard site. Pitching an unwinnable
race in New Jersey is not going to help Jeff Bell, but no one cares
about him anyway. The real pitch is for the “wave” theory, which says
“If Bell has a shot, imagine what your local GOP candidate could do with
just a few dollars more from you!” It’s all about moving product. Books,
magazines, TV shows and the massive consultancy racket that finances the
mandarin class.
