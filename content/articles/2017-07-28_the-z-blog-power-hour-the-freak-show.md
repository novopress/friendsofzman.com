This week was a big test for the project as I was traveling and that
meant recording this thing on the road and when time permitted. The
result was some strange acoustics in some parts and an on-the-fly
editing job at the airport.

I am at American Renaissance this weekend, so I will not be posting much
on the site. I expect to return on Sunday and provide a full report on
Hate-Fest 2017 as soon as I get settled in on Sunday

This week, Spreaker has the full show. YouTube has the full show and
some new graphics to distinguish the bits from the full show. I am now
on iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can now listen to me on their
Hitler phones.You’ll also a note I have renamed this thing, which is
explained in the podcast.
