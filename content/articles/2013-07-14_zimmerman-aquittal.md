In light of the Zimmerman acquittal, [John Derbyshire’s concept of the
cold civil
war](http://takimag.com/article/the_cold_civil_war_grinds_on_john_derbyshire/print#axzz2Z3TMO2W4)
seems about right. The prosecution of this guy had nothing to do with
race or racism. It had little to do this the facts of the case. This was
about one group of white people taking a shot at another group of white
people. John uses the labels Hutus and Tutsis, but that does not quite
work. Those groups hate one another over blood and land, the time
honored hatreds between tribes. In our war, one can pick sides. It’s the
nature of a culture war.

I prefer to frame it as Whole Foods whites versus WalMart whites.  Whole
Foods whites are mostly northern, mostly liberal and mostly college
educated. Go to a Whole Foods and the creepy conformity is a little
unnerving. The women dress the same, are roughly in the same age
bracket, sound the same and do their hair the same. The men are mostly
of the soft artsy variety. With a few exceptions everyone there is what
David Brooks described as Bourgeois Bohemian. It’s an updated form of
Puritan conformity.

WalMart whites have their own culture too. They are fat and wear clothes
that displays their pop culture preferences. While Whole Foods whites
will wear a plain t-shirt, the WalMart whites always have something
scrawled on their shirts and it is never the name of a college. The
parking lot will be full of domestic cars and pickup trucks, many with
NASACAR bumbler stickers. That’s the thing with these folks. They like
guns, car racing, country music and hearing fart jokes from guys like
Larry the Cable Guy.

When George Zimmerman shot and killed Trayvon Martin, Whole Foods Whites
saw nothing more than a WalMart white with a German last name and
assumed he must be the heir of Bull Connor. Strangely, despite their
educations, Whole Foods whites know little about the South and believe
nothing much has changed since 1968. The case for them was just another
chance to marginalize WalMart whites and their culture. In this regard
it is reminiscent of the Snopes – Compson dynamic in the Faulkner novels
