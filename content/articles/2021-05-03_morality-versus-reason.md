------------------------------------------------------------------------

David Hume observed that there is a difference between statements about
what is and statements about what ought to be. Hume’s law or Hume’s
guillotine has become an axiom of philosophy ever since. That axiom is
that you cannot move from descriptive statements to prescriptive ones.
Put another way, there are things that are true based on observation
like the movement of the stars. Then there are things that are true
based upon a set of rules, like ethics or religion.

Despite the fact–value distinction, people tend to conflate factual
truth with moral truth, especially in politics. For example, you could
make a solid economic argument in favor of slavery in certain areas of
the economy. Your reason could simply be to make a larger point about
economics or maybe labor in that field. That would not stop people from
condemning you as a heretic. The moral rule says that any mention of
slavery must be in a spasmodic condemnation of whiteness.

On the other hand, given the direction of American morality, you could
probably cook up an argument for assessing everything in blackness.
Since America was built on the backs of black labor, everything should
be valued in those terms. It is ridiculous as a matter of fact, but the
present morality would probably be receptive. Taken to its logical
conclusion, we could very well end up denominating all goods in
Africans, because the moral framework has sacralized black people.

No matter how rational and logical the argument, it cannot overcome
morality, but moral claims can easily overcome factual objections. In
the example above, the facts about labor markets and the reality of
servitude will never make a dent on public opinions regarding slavery,
because being opposed to slavery is a central part of the moral
framework of the current age. On the other hand, if slavery can be
recast to fit within that moral framework, then it will be eagerly
embraced.

This is the central problem of politics within a liberal democracy. The
spring of democracy is morality. The popular will always bends toward
the general morality, even when it goes against public interest. In
fact, the public is more easily persuaded to do things against their
interests than in their interests. The reason is sacrifice is always a
part of morality. Asking people to sacrifice in the name of some moral
cause turns their sacrifice into piety, which is the coin of the realm.

This is why liberal democracy seems to be shaking itself apart. In
theory, liberal democracy is supposed to be a representative government
constrained by the principles of liberalism. These principles are
enshrined in a constitution or a body of laws that limit the actions of
citizens and the government. Since everyone is equal before the law,
everyone has the same rights and privilege. Free speech and freedom of
association, for example, are inalienable rights of everyone.

In reality, that spring of democracy easily overrides the principles of
liberalism, always in the name of same great cause. You see this here in
a
[post](https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/05/race-demagogues-are-poisoning-our-politics/)
from someone calling himself a conservative. He writes, “Racism was such
a dark chapter for our country that, in striving for its extirpation, we
adopted anti-discrimination, public-accommodation, and even
affirmative-action provisions that are in tension with aspects of
liberty and the principle of equal protection under the law.”

The word “tension” there is a gratuitous assertion. There is no tension
between the moral orthodoxy regarding race and liberal principles. The
former overrides the latter and even so-called conservatives celebrate
it. He finished that paragraph with “The prudence of some of these
provisions is debatable, particularly their effectiveness in achieving
their lofty aims. We’ve maintained them nevertheless as a sign of
commitment to a society that is repulsed by racism.”

What is the logic behind reorganizing society in such a way that the
world knows we are “repulsed by racism”? There is no such argument.
There cannot be a rational argument against racism, as racism itself is
a social construct, something that only exists within a set of rules
created by current society. It is a devil created by progressivism a
century ago as one justification for their cause. As God slowly receded
from their moral framework, he took Old Scratch with him, so they
invented racism.

In a democracy, even a liberal one, “is” must always yield to “ought”
because morality is the organizing principle of a democracy. That
morality is defined by and expressed as the will of the people. If the
people are convinced that Africans are sacred people, they will conjure
unlimited arguments in defense of the notion, despite the objective
reality around them. To stand against the majority, even one conjured by
the mendacious, is to stand against accepted morality.

This is, of course, why various forms of conservatism and libertarianism
have all failed to make a dent in Progressivism. In a democracy, you
must win elections and that means getting the majority to agree with
you. You can do this my changing enough minds to win the election or you
can lie convincingly to enough people so that you win the election. Put
another way, you can *organize* people around new moral arguments, or
you *mobilize* people with some version of the old moral arguments.

Obviously, convincing people that their old beliefs are in error is a
lot more difficult than flattering them in some new way. Inevitably,
conservatism takes the latter course and comes up with some way to
flatter people’s existing sense of morality. Their promotion of Tim
Scott, for example, is a way to flatter white people on race. The result
of this is the people who claim to oppose the Left end up reinforcing
the moral claims of the people of the Left and are assimilated into
them.

This is why bourgeois objectivism is no match for left-wing ideology.
The cold reality of being correct can never overcome the warm
satisfaction of being *right*. Those descriptive statements about
reality are cold, while the prescriptive statements about what ought to
be are warm and comforting. People will sacrifice everything for the
warm glow of self-righteous certainty. The only antidote to the morality
of liberal democracy is an alternative moral framework that promises
more than sacrifice.
