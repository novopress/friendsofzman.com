Now that the Democrat circus is over, it is time to take a look at where
things stand for the election show. Regime toadies are just now waking
up in a pool of their own vomit after having partied hard for the last
month in what will be remembered as the greatest gaslighting campaign in
American history. It really has been an incredible month of unrelenting
bullshit from the regime.

In fact, I was tempted to call the show “Peak Bullshit”, but you have to
be careful using naughty words in these things. It is the right title.
The bullshit being sold to us is that this boozy dingbat is the greatest
candidate since Lincoln. In reality, she is closer to Gerald Ford, who
found himself leading his party after it managed to blow itself to
pieces in the Watergate coup that toppled Nixon.

It is the quintessential internet campaign thus far. Internet
gaslighting follows a predictable pattern. First a truckload of bullshit
is dumped on the internet by the regime media, which is followed by
“influencers” taking long deep breaths from the steaming pile of
bullshit, while telling us they predicted it. After this crowd runs out
of hot takes, the truth starts to creep into the conversation.

This week the “influencers” started to run out of things to say and
began looking around for the next trend to front run. That new trend
will be the reality that faces the regime as they try to drag the Boozy
– Fudd ticket over the finish line in every state they have to win order
to win the election. That list of states may turn out to be bigger than
all the so-called experts have been predicting.
