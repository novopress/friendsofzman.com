------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upon assuming the thrown in 568 AD, the Visigoth king Reccared converted
from Arian to Chalcedonian Christianity. This led to some unrest in the
kingdom, as the Visigoths had always been Arian. The Arians were mostly
tolerant of other religions, including paganism, but the Chalcedonians
were not so charitable. Reccared put down the unrest and then oversaw
the Third Council of Toledo in 589, where he announced his faith in the
Nicene creed and denounced Arianism.

The spiritual differences between Arians and Catholics may be of
interest to those with an interest in theology, but what matters to us
today is that the trinitarians were the winners in the theological
debates within the early church. From that point forward, there was one
true faith in the Visigoth kingdom. The people were expected to convert
to the new faith. Those who refused could expect some form of
repression, ranging from extra taxes to expulsion from the kingdom.

Why Reccared converted to Catholicism is not all that clear. The
material benefits, if they existed, have been lost over the centuries.
His conversion brought with it new conflicts, especially with the Jews
of his kingdom. The Arian kings had been disinterested in the faith of
their subjects, which meant they could get along with the Jews, who were
quite powerful in parts of the kingdom. That ended with the conversion
of Reccared, as the Catholics were not tolerant of Jews.

What happened in Spain under the Visigoths would be repeated many times
over the centuries in Europe. The ruling class would convert, and the
people were expected to convert along with them. In England, which was
controlled by many different kings, the Church converted one at time,
the same way they converted Reccared. Of course, the same pattern would
remerge in the Reformation. The rulers would change religion and the
people would be forced to change their religion as well.

If you wanted to pinpoint the birth of universalism and universal
intolerance in the West, the early Middle Ages is probably a good place
to start. The Romans persecuted a lot of Christians and Jews, but it was
mostly because they saw these movements as a direct threat to their
power. By the middle ages, persecution of heretics was no longer about
threats to power, but about violation of a universal truth. The mere
existence of doubters or skeptics was seen as a threat to the one true
faith.

The thing is, from the perspective of the common people, these changes
at the top probably made little sense. Imagine you are a proud Goth who
has served in the king’s army and then one day you are told you have to
change religions. The reason is that the old religion was all wrong. In
the case of the Visigoths, this happened twice. Once when some guy
created a bunch of squiggles he claimed was your language and everyone
became Arians. Then again when Reccared renounced Arianism.

People today should be able to relate to this. Within living memory, the
rulers made a point of showing they were faithful Christians. Jimmy
Carter was an Evangelical who spoke openly about his faith. Reagan
salted his language with Christian references and Bill Clinton carried a
Bible around with him. Today our rulers worship black people and think
men in dresses are the fullest expression of womanhood. The schools now
teach us the evils of whiteness and white privilege.

As with the Christian era in the West, this new religion brings with it
an extreme intolerance of skepticism and doubt. Men are being fired from
their jobs because they are not enthusiastic enough for the new faith.
Those who challenge the faith are anathematized in the same way the
early Church would anathematize those who challenged them. Our rulers
have not started breaking heretics on the wheel or decorating the
streets with the crucified, but it is still early.

We also see the universalism of the new faith. The rulers who embrace
this new religion are sure it is the only way any human society can
live. All of those in the past, the people that made the present
possible, we monstrous sinners. Those in the present, clinging to
alternative faiths, are monsters that must be destroyed. The ruling
class of America wants to have a nuclear war with Russia over
homosexuality. The Crusaders were insanely tolerant compared to today’s
crusaders.

There are differences obviously. The universal faith that emerged in the
early middle ages provided a social structure in which the West could
begin to advance materially and intellectually. Whatever its faults, the
Church provided a complex moral and social order that eventually
resulted in what we think of as Western Civilization. The faith emerging
today among our rulers is a step back into barbarism. It is a reversion
to some pre-modern mean, corresponding with the collapse of the West.

The other big difference is the rulers converting to or from the Church
in the past did so mostly out of conviction. There were material
interests, for sure, but most genuinely believed in what they were
doing. They thought what they were doing was in the best interest of
their people. Today the rulers are guided by what they imagine is in the
worst interest of their people. This new religion is not about elevating
them or their people, but about harming the people who make their rule
possible.

The other big difference between now and past conversions is the people
did not have much to lose by going along with the king’s new religion.
Life in the early middle ages was not easy, so giving up the old gods
for this new thing or changing from one form of Christ worship to
another slightly different form was not a huge risk. The conversion we
are seeing today threatens the very existence of the West. If our rulers
are wrong, the ape historians of the future will puzzle over why we went
along with it.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
