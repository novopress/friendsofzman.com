The interwebs tells me that <a

particularly Trump voters.

For those too young to remember, or too old to remember, Rob Reiner is
famous for having played the character “Meathead” on the popular 70’s TV
show *All In The Family*. The show was supposed to mock traditional
Americans, particularly blue collar Americans, but the public received
it mostly as a celebration of normal people at a time when normals were
under assault from liberals, hippies and various other degenerates. Rob
Reiner’s character came to represent what had gone wrong with the
country.

Meathead was a loudmouth know-it-all boomer, who enjoyed lecturing his
father-in-law about the terribleness of America and the men that had
made the country. The irony was that Meathead lived off the people he
ridiculed. Archie, the patriarch, worked and paid the bills while his
daughter and son-in-law lived in his house. It was a perfect metaphor
for what was happening in the country. The parasites were determined to
kill the host, but in the mean time they were perfectly willing to enjoy
the fruits the host had accumulated.

Years ago, the great Paul Gottfried remarked that the country had long
been taken over by the Meathead generation and their ethics. The Archie
Bunkers were all gone. By that he meant traditional working and middle
class America had been lost and the country was now run by fashionable
liberals, who occupied the first ruling elite in history to be actively
working to destroy the foundation on which it rests. Look around the
culture and all the high ground is occupied by degenerate boomers, who
carry on as if it is still 1968.

It has been said a million times in a million places, but the Meathead
generation has been, on the whole, a national disaster for America. The
nation started falling to pieces right around when the first wave of
boomers hit adulthood. With a respite in the 80’s when the old and the
young teamed up to support a return to sanity, it has been a fifty year
slide into cultural turpitude, forced upon us by the Early Boomer
cohort. Look around the political class and the <a

target="_blank">worst</a> of the
<a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UbEalLMQvOw/maxresdefault.jpg"
target="_blank">worst</a> were born in the 40’s and were apart of the
first assault upon the culture fifty years ago.

The good news, if there is any, is that the Early Boomers are starting
to croak. The front edge is now 70, which means they are retiring or
dropping dead quickly. The demographers place the end of Baby Boom as
1964, but that’s never been very useful culturally. Someone born in 1964
has nothing in common with someone born in 1946. The real troublesome
cohort was born in the ten year period following the war.These are the
Early Boomers, the first wave that we generally associate with the
madness of the late 60’s and early 70’s.

That means if you are a young alt-right trouble maker, you only have
another decade or so to put up with degenerates like Rob Reiner. This
realization may be at the heart of the hysteria we see in the ruling
class. Rasping geezers like Hillary Clinton look around and see their
time is just about done. They also see that what is forming up behind
them is a giant cultural eraser, ready to rub out any trace of what her
cohort leaves behind. <a

target="_blank">Her “Basket of Deplorables”</a> are young dudes and
dudettes in hazmat suits, ready for cleanup.

Maybe that happens, maybe it is too far gone and alt-right is a just an
echo from a past that is too far gone to matter. Regardless, generation
Meathead will be remembered as the cohort that gnawed away at the social
fabric of the nation, like rats, until it began to fall to pieces. Maybe
this election is the start of the great cleaning up of the mess made by
guys like Reiner and he cohort. Maybe it is something else, but their
time is coming to an end. Generation Meathead will soon be gone. Good
riddance to bad cess.
