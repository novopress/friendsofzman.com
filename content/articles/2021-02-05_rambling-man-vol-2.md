One of the weird parts of the mass media age is the constant bombardment
from the firehose of mass media warps our sense of time. The Pretender
Biden was installed just a couple of weeks ago, but it feels like a long
time ago. It always feels like so much is happening in the moment, that
what happened in the prior moment has tp be stashed in long term memory.
Just as you are processing one bizarre thing from the ruling class, they
are firing the next bizarre action at us.

It is a relentless succession of events, one more stranger than the
next. The most powerful tool of managerial authoritarianism is constant
disruption. The thing is, it is not a deliberate strategy. They are not
sitting around thinking about what loony thing they can do next to
create disruption. They have a need for the constant crisis. They need
to feel as if life is on the knife edge at all times. it one result of
the feminization of the managerial class. It is endless drama.

Still, when you take a break from the firehose and assess things, it is
striking just how bizarre the word is all of a sudden. Collapse of any
sort is like a man falling down a very long flight of stairs. From the
top, it is a quick tumble then a long landing. That landing runs out of
road and another stumble down some stairs to another landing and the
process keeps repeating. You can add in a brief ascent back up to a
previous landing, if you like, to account for those periods of reform
and renewal.

The bizarreness comes from the lack of self-awareness. The people hiding
behind the razor wire green zone in Washington never think about how
this looks to the hundreds of millions on the other side. They don’t
even consider it. They are like fireflies in a jar, obsessed with
blinking at one another. They are oblivious to how it looks to those
outside, because they are oblivious to the idea of an outside. This is
probably the most remarkable change in the last few decades.

Still, the spectacle is incredible. We live in an age when a Puerto
Rican barmaid and a bald black woman with the IQ of a goldfish stand on
the floor of the House sharing their “lived experiences”, which are
totally fabricated. Not only that, these people are our rulers or at
least members of the ruling class. Things would be less ridiculous if a
state put a horse in the Senate. Calling this clown world is an affront
to the men who dedicated their lives to making kids laugh at the circus.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
