There is plenty of talk about the demographic changes happening in
America, but not much thought about where it is headed. Some people
mention the fact that the country will be majority-minority in a
generation, but no one likes to think about that so that is as far as it
ever gets. The people in charge seem to think America will be Brazil but
without the favellas and kidnapping industry.

The fact is the social and political structures that have defined
America cannot survive the demographic changes that are coming fast. The
main reason for that is the majority population, once it becomes just
another minority population, cannot continue to think like a majority
population. The majority will no longer be able to swap the good of the
whole for the good of their group.

Everything about America is the result of the majority population
swapping their interest for the interest of the country. This altruism
works only when the interests of the country are seen to align with the
interest of the dominant majority, which is a thing that comes naturally
when the majority is near ninety percent. Once that majority shrinks
down to nearly fifty percent this perception collapses.

This is what we see happening all around us. The majority looks around
and see nothing but angry minorities, both unhappy with their position
in society and totally unwilling to sacrifice anything for the good of
the whole. The campus protests, for example, are just another sign that
we have reached the tragedy of the commons phase of the demographic
collapse of the white majority.

That is the show this week. It is a rumination on how majorities
naturally see themselves and how minorities naturally see themselves.
Democracy can only work in a majoritarian society. Once a democratic
society devolves into a majority-minority society, minoritarianism takes
over and democracy is no longer possible. What comes next is from a set
of choices most do not relish.
