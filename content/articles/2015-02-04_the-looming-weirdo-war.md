*Used to describe something that’s been around much longer than the word
itself, the phenomenon of homonormativity is considered by many to be
destructive to the queer rights movement and to the larger queer
community.*

*Homonormativity is a word that addresses the problems of privilege we
see in the queer community today as they intersect with <a

and <a href="http://everydayfeminism.com/2014/03/everyday-cissexism/"

up leaving many people out of the movement toward greater sexual freedom
and equality.*

Feminism is unabashedly anti-capitalism now. By capitalism, she means
free markets, not the concentrations of wealth derided by traditional
conservatives. The writer, for example, is in the
<a href="http://www.iphoneogram.com/u/45042629" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">MacCult</a>. The preferred economic model of these folks
is closer to Mussolini than Marx. She’s OK with enormous companies that
turn their owners into super-rich billionaires, as long as the companies
are of the one true faith. Walmart is bad capitalism and Apple is
socially responsible entrepreneurship.

The other crimes (sins?) are just new names for the same old insanity
second wave feminism offered up. The “cisgender” thing should be
categorized as a mental illness. If someone declared Newton’s laws of
motion “oppressive” we would lock them up, for fear they would jump in
front of a car or jump off a building. If instead of saying they were a
third sex, these people insisted we pretend they are invisible, they
would be wearing a jacket with no sleeves.

*First, let’s examine it’s
counterpart, <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-heteronormative-mean.htm"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">heteronormativity</a>. This is a word
that similarly describes the evaluation of “normal” sexuality that we
see in our culture, from the policy and institutional level down to the
interpersonal.*

href="http://www.eldis.org/go/topics/resource-guides/gender/key-issues/heteronormativity"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">heteronormativity</a>, which describes
the assumption and promotion that heterosexuality is the only “normal”
and “natural” orientation out there, privileging those who fit the norm
and positing anyone outside of this as abnormal and wrong.*

***Our culture is deeply heteronormative, but as queer experiences and
rights become more accepted, a policing of sexual and gender expressions
within LGBQ spaces is also growing. This is** <a
href="http://dismantlinghomonormativity.weebly.com/what-is-homonormativity.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>homonormativity</strong></a>**.***

*Homonormativity explains how certain aspects of the queer community can
perpetuate assumptions, values, and behaviors that hurt and marginalize
many folks within this community, as well as those with whom the
community should be working in
[solidarity](http://everydayfeminism.com/2014/03/moving-past-privilege-guilt/ "True Solidarity: Moving Past Privilege Guilt").*

*It addresses assimilation, as well as intersection of corporate
interests and consumerism within LGBQ spaces.*

***It also describes the assumption that queer people want to be a part
of the dominant, mainstream, heterosexual culture, and the way in which
our society rewards those who do so, identifying them as most worthy and
deserving of visibility and rights.  ***

Bold in the original. My base assumption in life is that the invention
of new worlds or jargon follows the invention of new lies. Words have
meaning and when a people use an agreed upon lexicon, lying is
difficult. Thus the need for new words and new grammatical
constructions. Whenever I’m confronted with jargon I get suspicious.

In this case, these people are trying to cloak their true intentions. It
never has been about rights or even acceptance with regards to
homosexuality. It is certainly not what is at play with the more
deranged members of these sexual identity cults. It’s about offending
normal people. The guys in sundresses want to parade around your kid’s
school because it offends you. The worst thing that could happen to them
is for people to accept it. South Park did an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_Camp_of_Tolerance"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">episode</a> on it.

*As we’ve seen the issue of marriage equality gain success, swooping the
nation in election after election, we have to question its position as
The Gay Rights Issue™.*

*Fighting for sexual liberation and equality is, of course, so much more
than fighting for the right to marry, but how is the positioning of
marriage equality as the major issue also <a
href="http://sfonline.barnard.edu/a-new-queer-agenda/beyond-marriage-democracy-equality-and-kinship-for-a-new-century/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">promoting homonormativity</a>?*

***Marriage as an issue sets up the requirement that all relationships
should mimic this heteronormative standard of sexuality and family
structure.** It promotes the idea that all people want to emulate
straight monogamous couples.*

*When we focus only on this issue, we exclude polyamorous and other
non-normative relationship structures as acceptable, as well as, of
course, those who don’t want to get married.*

*Even as marriage becomes inclusive of a particular kind of queer
relationship, <a
href="http://www.organizingupgrade.com/index.php/modules-menu/beyond-capitalism/item/1002-marriage-will-never-set-us-free"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">it perpetuates a policing of other kinds
of relationships</a>, maintaining the borderline of what is an
“acceptable queer relationship.”*

*The focus on marriage challenges very little, prioritizing the legal
sanctioning of one’s relationships over real relational and societal
transformation.*

*By showing that people outside of the heterosexual norm want the same
things that “traditional, straight America” wants, **themarriage
equality movement fights to gain access to this social institution by
reproducing, rather than challenging, heterosexual dominance and
normativity andusing this as a basis for who deserves rights**.*

I’ve often remarked that inside of a mass movement, people find clarity.
That’s what keeps them in the movement. Every failure and every setback
is explained in someway that signals to the adherents that they must
redouble their efforts. Every success is met with sound reasons why they
must keep fighting for whatever it is the movement uses as a lure for
the adherents. In some case, plain old delusion works fine as in the
belief gay marriage is <a
href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/why-does-gay-marriage-keep-losing-at-the-ballot-box/2012/05/09/gIQAzhlNDU_blog.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">popular at the ballot box</a>.

Putting that aside, the incoherence of these crotch-cults is what will
ultimately pull them apart. Gay marriage is the obvious example.
Homosexuals have a near total lack of monogamy. The social science is
quite stunning, but social science is not science so it can always be
disputed. Real science tells us that homosexual males account for 1.6%
of the population and 65% of syphilis cases. Syphilis rates are a good
proxy for promiscuity rates. People with astronomically high promiscuity
rates are never going to adopt marriage, which has proven to be the
case.

Therein lies the problem. In addition to having the dog chasing the car
problem that is a feature of all mass movements, the sexual identity
cults have the additional problem of success invalidating the cause.
Social adoption of gay marriage will just prove it was ridiculous from
the start. Similarly, normalizing all of these other fetishes will only
make those causes appear more absurd.

When the dog catches the car, we all see there was never a car. He was
just running around and barking.

The article is a crazy quilt of jargon and locution aimed at people in
the third wave feminism cult so it is easy for a normal like myself to
misinterpret it. Still, the vibe is undeniable. The gals at the womyn’s
studies department are getting uncomfortable with the queers. It’s not
just that they are jealous of the success of gay males in the culture.
It’s that the queer rights stuff is making it impossible to turn weird
for the sake of being weird into a political cause. The womyn are about
declare war on the queers.
