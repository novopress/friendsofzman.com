Raw intelligence is a poor predictor of political success. The HBD
people tends to link IQ with everything, even politics, despite the
rather obvious fact that many of our politicians are uncommonly stupid.
Joe Biden is quite dull. Years of drinking and a few strokes have shaved
a dozen points off his IQ. Odds are he would score in the low 20’s on
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonderlic_Test"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wonderlic Test</a>, maybe even
high teens. His rather obvious lack of intelligence has not worked
against him. He’s going to president one day.

Saying that politicians are dumb is a popular past time, but not all of
them are dumb and even the dumb ones can say some smart things. Simply
noticing things can be the smartest thing one can do and some of our
politicians can notice things. Sarah Palin was hooted down by the Left
for her alleged lack of smarts. They mocked here for claiming Russian
had designs on parts of the Ukraine.  <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This story from Breitbart goes
into it in light of recent events.</a>.

*During the 2008 presidential campaign, Republican vice presidential
nominee Sarah Palin warned that if Senator Barack Obama were elected
president, his “indecision” and “moral equivalence” may encourage
Russia’s Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine.*

*Palin said then:*

*After the Russian Army invaded the nation of Georgia, Senator Obama’s
reaction was one of indecision and moral equivalence, the kind of
response that would only encourage Russia’s Putin to invade Ukraine
next.*

*For those comments, she was mocked by the high-brow Foreign Policy
magazine and its editor Blake Hounshell, who now is one of the editors
of Politico magazine.*

*In light of recent events in Ukraine and concerns that Russia is
getting its troops ready to cross the border into the neighboring
nation, nobody seems to be laughing at or dismissing those comments
now.*

*Hounshell wrote then that Palin’s comments were “strange” and “this is
an extremely far-fetched scenario.”*

*“And given how Russia has been able to unsettle Ukraine’s pro-Western
government without firing a shot, I don’t see why violence would be
necessary to bring Kiev to heel,” Hounshell dismissively wrote.*

*Palin made her remarks on the stump after Obama’s running mate Joe
Biden warned Obama supporters to “gird  your loins” if Obama is elected
because international leaders may test or try to take advantage of him.*

That’s not to say Palin is very smart. It is a good bet that she is not
working math puzzles in her free time. She’s not dumb like Joe Biden.
Palin is school teacher smart, while Biden is fork lift driver smart. On
the other hand, Biden is politician smart, while Palin is not. One can
be left unsupervised while the other may run with scissors if you don’t
watch him. You can trust Palin with your kids, while Biden, well, you
know.

That’s the thing about politics in a social democracy. it’s not about
smarts. Palin could have been the sharpest person in the room, but the
Left would still call her dumb, because they need to call her dumb. They
would get away with it because she is not good at politics in the way a
lunkhead like Joe Biden is good at politics. That’s why democracy is a
terrible system. It rewards Joe Biden and punishes Sarah Palin.
