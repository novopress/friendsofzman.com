An informal metric for measuring the stability of a society is the
distance between reality and the official truth of the ruling regime.
The more lies the regime tells, the less stable it and the society over
which it rules. Official lies are a good proxy for the degree of
authoritarianism within the regime. The degree of authoritarianism is a
good proxy for the level of official insecurity. The more thuggish the
regime the less support it enjoys, thus the more it needs to lie to the
people.

At the extreme end of this metric is a place like North Korea. The
regime is deeply paranoid about everything. The Kim family does not
trust anyone in the ruling class and no one in the ruling class trusts
anyone, especially Kim. The one thing everyone agrees upon is they
cannot trust the people. This is why they get images of the tubby Kim in
heroic poses or stories of him making ten holes in one playing golf. The
regime feels it needs to present him as a god to intimidate the people.

On the other end of the spectrum, you get a place like Switzerland that
barely has a government relative to the rest of Europe. Many Swiss
residents do not know who is currently holding the position of
president. It is a rotating position currently held by someone calling
herself Simonetta Sommaruga. The Swiss government has no need to turn
her into a rock star or make while claims about her. The official truth
of Switzerland is easy for everyone to see, so they have no need to lie.

Obviously, it is an informal metric that is subjective. An extreme case
like North Korea is easy to use, but where would France or Germany fall
on the scale? They are closer to Switzerland than Ukraine or the United
States, but not so close that anyone in France would say they believe
their government. In fact, that is the story of the West since the end
of the Cold War. Every Western nation has moved down the scale of
honesty toward the North Korean pole over the last three decades.

Lying has consequences. One lie begets another lie which then requires
more elaborate lying to cover up the previous lies. This lowers trust in
the state, but it also lowers trust in institutions and eventually
lowers social trust. Step one is the lies erode faith in the ruling
class of the country. Step two is people lose faith in the institutions
for not having punished the liars. The final step is the people who wake
up to the official lies lose trust in those who keep falling for the
lies.

You see this with the school shootings. Generations of lying about the
nature of crime and the role of guns in these school shooting, have made
it impossible to have a civil conversation about the issue. The bodies
were not even cold after the latest school shooting and the usual
suspects were out in public telling the all to familiar lies about the
causes of these crimes. The only thing that comes from this is normal
people grow to hate these liars a little more than they did yesterday.

How many people watched President Biden speak about the Texas shooting?
The answer, if it was possible to get an honest one, was close to zero.
Joe Biden has been a promiscuous liar for generations. Now he is an
incontinent zombie barely able to read his script. That script is
written by the same collection of sociopaths than have infected politics
since the Clintons blew into town. Even the sociopaths have lost
interest in the production of these ridiculous theaters of mendacity.

Tragic outliers like a deranged lunatic going on a rampage are just part
of the human condition, but can something be done to limit it? It feels
like this stuff happens more often now, but who can know? The even
bigger question is why are these obviously deranged people ignored by
the people around them? The Buffalo shooter was ignored by everyone,
despite the obvious signs. The liars fill the space with lies about the
subject so that getting a straight answer is impossible.

Of course, the reason the liars exist is they keep people off balance.
Official lying has been outsourced in what may be the most cyclical
public-private partnership in human history, so that the rulers can just
nod along with the symphony of lies. Biden’s script writers just go to
one of the websites of the many organizations who exist to produce
official nonsense and jot down a few of their lines. The mass media, of
course, then blasts this and their own lies to the public.

One of the underrated aspects of Orwell’s Animal Farm is how the pigs
used deception to create doubt among the animals. It reached the point
where the animals could not trust their own memory. The other day, the
Washington Post <a
href="https://nypost.com/2022/05/24/washington-post-deletes-tweet-that-george-floyd-was-shot/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">claimed</a> George Floyd was shot by
police. How long before school children are taught that he was hanged by
the Proud Boys? More important, how many people will tire of correcting
the record and this lie becomes official truth?

The official lies are not just about keeping the public confused. It
also serves to keep the managerial class huddled together. On the topic
of official lies, the classic Vaclav Havel
[essay](https://hac.bard.edu/amor-mundi/the-power-of-the-powerless-vaclav-havel-2011-12-23),
“The Power of the Powerless” comes to mind. Amazingly, the people who
shower the public with disinformation, the official lies, claim to be
fighting against disinformation, often citing Havel’s essay. The lying
is an important part of their identity as a besieged group defending
“our democracy.”

In the final years of the Soviet Union, the general public no longer
believed anything said by their government. The people in government
were every bit as cynical about the official truths, but they were paid
to lie so they lied. What held it together is both sides were sure the
other side believed the lies, at least enough of them that the rest
dared not question the lies. The collapsed came when everyone realized
that no one believed what they were forced to say or forced to hear.

Havel opened his famous essay with this line. “A specter is haunting
Eastern Europe: the specter of what in the West is called dissent.” He
then explained, “It was born at a time when this system, for a thousand
reasons, can no longer base itself on the unadulterated, brutal, and
arbitrary application of power, eliminating all expressions of
nonconformity.” That was almost fifty years ago in a world that is
largely forgotten by modern people, yet terribly familiar to us now.

The final sentence of that opening paragraph is, “What is more, the
system has become so ossified politically that there is practically no
way for such nonconformity to be implemented within its official
structures.” One paragraph from a dissident operating in an alien system
from the past captures the current moment in America. A decade later
that system collapsed. That is what the sea of lies from our rulers
tells us about what lies ahead. A regime built on lies always ends in
collapse.
