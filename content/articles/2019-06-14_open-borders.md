In the process of registering for
<a href="https://nationalconservatism.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">this event</a>, I had to interact with some of the
beautiful people, who are trying to create a “new” nationalism. What
struck me is just how far away we are from one another in terms of our
politics. What passes for the “far right” among the Cloud People is
pretty tame stuff. For example, the “new” far right is still not sure if
we should end immigration. Some think open borders is fine, while others
think some limits are OK, but otherwise nationalism means open borders.

Since the purpose of my attendance is to get some of these people to pay
more attention to what dissidents are saying about the issues of the
day, I thought a show about immigration was a good idea. I have not done
a lot on the subject. I’m a zero immigration guy, so I tend to forget
that most people are still making their mind up about this subject. New
people heading our way are mostly coming for the identity politics
stuff, but immigration is a big driver of it and a major concern for
dissidents.

The first segment is twice the normal length and I may post this as a
clip at some point, as it is the sort of thing to send to your friend in
the Ben Shapiro fan club. In that first segment, I walk through all the
different ways people can legally enter America. My guess is few people
here know about all of the various visa programs. The typical normie
knows nothing about the immigration system. I found it astounding that
it took me 20 minutes to read all of it out loud and I take the time to
learn this stuff.

**The Daily Reminder:** As you surely know, we are facing a giant spider
invasion. Those of us on the front lines fighting the giant spider
invasion can’t do it without your support. If you care about your
community and want to support those working hard on your behalf,
consider supporting my work by donating the price of a beer or a cup of
coffee at Starbucks. <a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/the-z-blog"

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
