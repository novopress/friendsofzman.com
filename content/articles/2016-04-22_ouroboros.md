If you have been reading this blog regularly, you’ll know I’m skeptical
about the long term prospects of the managerial revolution. It’s not
just that technocrats have a poor history. Even allowing for the miracle
of the meritocracy to correct past errors, the very nature of
technocracy is antithetical to nature. It requires constant care and
maintenance to keep it running.

As with anything that requires constant repair and defense, the cost of
maintaining it eventually consumes all benefit. At the point of
diminishing returns, it becomes a question of when, not if, it
collapses. The most obvious example is the Roman Empire. Once they ran
out of profitable people to conquer, they were left with the expense of
empire, but no new revenues to offset those expenses.

To quote Gibbon’s summary of the decline of Rome:

*“The number of ministers, of magistrates, of officers, and of servants,
who filled the different departments of the state, was mul­tiplied beyond
the example of for­mer times; and (if we may bor­row the warm expression
of a con­temporary) ‘when the proportion of those who received exceeded
the proportion of those who con­tributed the provinces were op­pressed by
the weight of tributes.’ From this period to the extinction of the
empire it would be easy to deduce an uninterrupted series of clamors and
complaints. Accord­ing to his religion and situation, each writer chooses
either Diocle­tian or Constantine or Valens or Theodosius, for the object
of his invectives; but they unanimously agree in representing the burden
of the public impositions, and par­ticularly the land-tax and capita­tion,
as the intolerable and in­creasing grievance of their own times.”*

I’m offering that up for the new readers, of which there are many, so
you can know where I’m coming from when critiquing <a
href="http://www.global.nationalreview.com/article/434313/donald-trump-republican-party-future-reform-conservatives"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">stuff like this from Ramesh Ponnuru</a>,
who is the dean of the “reform-o-cons.” To be fair to Ponnuru, he is one
of the few in the Buckley Conservative ecosphere that has not made a
fool of himself over Trump. He has been rather sensible in his opinions
and forthcoming about his motivations. The sad fact of modern life is
most public men do not come upon their opinions honestly.

Even so, Ponnuru is a technocrat who spends his days imagining
technocratic solutions to the problems of the technocracy. Therefore he
focuses on the technocratic stuff like moving commas around the tax code
or crafting new regulations to fix prior regulations. For the men of the
managerial class, every answer is a recursive solution that aggregates
more and more to the managerial class, at the expense of those outside
their class.

The result is a weird myopia that seems to come naturally to the
bureaucratic mind and it is on display in this bit from the column.

*But if some reform-conservative premises have been vindicated,
reform-conservative policies have played almost no role in those
primaries. Senator Rubio did the most to embrace those ideas. In mid
2014, he started echoing reformist themes: the need to apply
conservative thinking in fresh ways, the potential of conservative
reforms to reduce the cost of living and thereby make a difference in
people’s lives. He came out for an Obamacare replacement that made it
possible for nearly everyone to purchase at least catastrophic coverage
while deregulating the system. He sponsored legislation allowing people
to finance higher education in new ways. And he advocated tax relief for
middle-class parents, not just high earners (although his plan also gave
high earners very large tax cuts). He did not talk about these
initiatives very much, however, perhaps viewing them as helpful in a
general election rather than in a Republican primary. Rubio talked about
his tax plan twice in the debates, both times in response to criticism.
He was more associated with his 2013 immigration bill and a very
hawkish-sounding foreign policy than he was with any domestic agenda. He
came across less as an innovator than as a younger, more articulate, and
Hispanic version of George W. Bush. He ended up doing well among
affluent, college-educated Republican voters but not connecting with the
more economically stressed and disaffected voters he needed.*

That bit of self-delusion is probably popular with most members of the
managerial class. It also shows why this phenomenon is inherently
unstable. The only acceptable responses to the challenges facing America
are those that require a massive jobs program for the members of the
managerial elite and those seeking entry into the system. Reforming or
reducing the managerial class is off the table, even when it is the
source of social dysfunction.

Therein lies the central defect of the managerial revolution. It is a
headless version of Diocletian’s innovation. Instead of a bureaucracy in
support of the emperor, it is a bureaucracy in support of itself. It
commands no loyalty outside of those it serves, which is strictly the
managerial class. Policy proposals have as their underlying motivation
the desire of the writers to send their kids to Princeton. If anyone
else benefits, that’s a happy accident.

Class awareness brings with it the myopia you see in the Ponnuru column.
The Left side has dropped their interest in economics because they can
no longer imagine what it is like to be subject to the rhythms of the
economy. They have no need to know. The right side has dropped the flag
waving and calls to patriotism because they no longer know anyone who
cares about those things. All that matters is advancement within a
system that has no top. It is a snake eating its tail.
