Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, the logic of the West has
rested on the theory that the Russians cannot sustain a long war. In the
winter of 2022 the argument was summed up by Francis Fukuyama in this
legendarily wrong <a
href="https://www.americanpurpose.com/blog/fukuyama/preparing-for-defeat/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a>. In that post he claimed the
Russian army was about to collapse at any minute and maybe take the
Putin government down with it. He then followed up on that claim with a
similar <a
href="https://www.americanpurpose.com/blog/fukuyama/why-ukraine-will-win/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a>, in which he claimed to have
been right, amazingly enough.

It is tempting to dismiss Fukuyama as just another brazen hustler that
circulates around the managerial class, but he is one of the more
successful ones. His famous book, *The End of History and the Last Man*,
was a massive best seller primarily because he pushed all the right
buttons for the post-Cold War elites. It was massively successful
flattery because the people being flattered believed it. They continue
to believe it, which is why they maintain a bellicose foreign policy.

Put another way, these grifters passing themselves off as intellectuals
tell us something about the system that hosts them, but also the people
they flatter. Fukuyama gets to travel around the empire passing as a
sage, because the people hosting him think he is right and that is
because they want him to be right. Meanwhile, a guy who has been
consistently right, John Mearsheimer, gets called mean names, mostly
because he is right and the people calling him names hate him for it.

This blinkered view is how we got the war in Ukraine. This almost
religious belief that the triumph of the West in the Cold War was the
beginning of the final journey into the promised land, the end of
history, has shaped imperial policy, both foreign and domestic, for
decades. Fukuyama wrote his book in 1992 and others have been building
on it ever since. In his 1997 <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Grand-Chessboard-American-Geostrategic-Imperatives/dp/0465027261"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">book</a>, *The Grand Chessboard*,
Zbigniew Brzezinski argued for the breaking up of Russia to finish the
Cold War.

In other words, the war in Ukraine is not something that happened for no
reason at all, but rather it is the product of a messianic outlook in
the West that has existed since at least the end of the Cold War. In
fact, the war looks like it comes right from the Western playbook to
undermine and topple the Putin government. This <a
href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR3000/RR3063/RAND_RR3063.pdf"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">study</a> by the RAND Corporation, the
most important think tank in the empire, talks specifically about this
type of project as a tool to destabilize Russia.

The point of all this is to properly frame the war as part of the
overall belief system of the West, rather than just something that
happened for no reason at all. Washington expected this war because they
had been planning for it for decades. Even though they were wrong in
most of their assumptions, there is no reason to think that belief
structure has changed. History shows that believers do not abandon their
beliefs when faced with disconfirmation. They just believe harder.

That is important to understand when thinking about what comes next. The
micro-countries of NATO are now yapping about war with Russia.
Hilariously, tiny Estonia is offering security guarantees to Ukraine.
The Estonia military is about the size of the Las Vegas police
department and probably just as lethal. Lithuania is now <a
href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-bundeswehr-zeitenwende-tanks-troops-lithuania-russia-artillery-nato-steadfast-defender/#:~:text=After%20taking%20the%20landmark%20decision,border%20with%20Russian%20ally%20Belarus."
rel="noopener" target="_blank">inviting</a> in the Germans to build
defensive structures for the assumed Russian attack. Perhaps the Germans
will bring their <a
href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/german-soldiers-used-broomsticks-instead-of-guns-during-nato-exercise/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">broomsticks</a> with them.

The reason these small players are making these noises is the same
reason Fukuyama wrote a book, calling the people he wished to flatter,
the deliverers of mankind from the clutches of irrationality. These
micro-countries organize their foreign affairs around flattering the
powerful. Without NATO, Kaja Kallas is as well-known as the mayor of
Wichita, but in NATO she can stand on the big stage, just as long as she
<a
href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-russia-war-help-estonia-prime-minister-kaja-kallas/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">tells</a> Washington what they wish to
hear.

This is what makes the moment so dangerous. Kallas is a simpleton, but
an obsequious simpleton, so she often speaks the truth about her
masters. Washington has no plan for ending the war other than the total
defeat of Russia, something that can only happen if they launch nuclear
weapons. The current debate about letting Ukraine use NATO weapons to
attack inside Russia is mostly about normalizing the idea of NATO
attacking inside Russia, something the Russians will never tolerate.

Compounding all of this is the fact that Ukraine is slowly being ground
down by the Russian war machine. All of Ukraine is now forced to ration
electricity. Major cities have long blackouts due to the lack of energy.
The Ukraine army is desperate for soldiers, but all of the men have gone
into hiding to avoid being grabbed off the streets and sent directly to
the front. These raw “recruits” are being <a
href="https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-june-2-2024"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">trained</a> at the front, which means
thrown into a trench with a rifle and a few grenades.

The point is we will soon see something like what Leon Festinger, Henry
Riecken, and Stanley Schachter described in their
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Prophecy_Fails"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">study</a> of a UFO cult. Western
political leaders have been assured for decades that the promised land
lies just after the final disillusion of Russia, which will come any day
now. Like the people waiting for the space aliens, they have been
waiting for regime change in Russia. Instead, they may be facing angry
mobs outside their own palaces as the project collapses.

We live in an age of wonders, but the greatest wonder to be revealed
will be when the regime realizes that the future promised to them by the
neocons and their fellow travelers was never going to be reality. When
the Ukraine army starts to buckle and the politics in Kiev become
violent, how will the West react? Will reality suddenly descend upon
Washington, or will they do like the cult members in *When Prophesy
Fails* and find some way to internalize it and keep the faith?
