People who fret about the future and those unhappy with the people in
charge, tend to rely on Orwell for their ammunition. The truth is,
Orwell got most things wrong. The future is not going to be a boot
stamping on a human face forever. The future is going to be something
closer to what Huxley had in mind.

Automation will do most of the work required to sustain life and people
will spend their free time on drugs or their technological
equivalents. The “feelies” were a type of movie experience Huxley
described where the viewers experienced raw emotions, rather than
watching a story with characters and plot.  According to this story, <a
href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/10602690/Wearable-book-allows-reader-to-feel-emotions-of-characters.html"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">books will soon deliver
emotion to the reade</a>r.

*Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology have created a
“wearable” book which allows the reader to experience the protagonist’s
emotions.*

*Using a combination of sensors, the book senses which page the reader
is on and triggers vibration patterns through a special vest.*

*“Changes in the protagonist’s emotional or physical state trigger
discrete feedback in the wearable \[vest\], whether by changing the
heartbeat rate, creating constriction through air pressure bags, or
causing localised temperature fluctuations” the researchers said.*

*The vest contains a personal heating device to change skin temperature
and a compression system to convey tightness or loosening through
airbags.*

It will not be long before movies move from 3D to 4D, where the fourth
dimension is smelling, tasting and so forth. Instead of sitting in a
theater, you put on your headset, plug into the grid and join other in
some grand adventure that is like being in a video game. It will be
lucid dreaming with a social element. Old people will lie around
reliving their youth until the state pulls the plug. Maybe it will work
out just fine or maybe not.
