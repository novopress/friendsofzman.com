The old expression is that change is constant, which is true, but the
rate of change is anything but constant. Material progress goes in fits
and starts and cultural change is anything but guaranteed. The great
cultural revolution that begin in America after the second industrial
war is an anomaly. These sorts of sweeping cultural changes are not the
norm in human existence. if within this unusual period of change, there
have been quiet times when things have not changed much.

For example, the 1980’s were a relatively quiet time on the culture
front. In fact, lots of people assumed at the time that the crazy
changes of the 60’s and 70’s had finally run their course and things
would return to normal. Aesthetically, the 80’s look much more like the
50’s than the 60’s and 70’s, so it made some sense. Then in the 90’s the
crazies started getting wound up again and we entered another period of
change. In fact, we are still in the second cultural revolution.

The thing is, people talk about the stuff that is easy to see like
clothing styles, material goods or technology, but that’s not real
change. Sure, cars are incredibly complex technology platforms now, but
they still do the same stuff as previous cars. People have more stuff
their homes, but their home is still their home. Our living arrangements
have not changed, other than we have more adults living with their
parents and fewer married women than previous eras. That’s the real
change,

Oddly, the people who notice these changes the least are the people who
have lived through the rapid change. It just gets normalized. Young
people, on the other hand, can look at the past from a purely objective
set of eyes and see the gaps. Again, it is often in the obvious stuff
like technology and fashion, but as we see with the Zoomers, they notice
the other stuff too. The dissident youth look around and wonder why in
the hell their ancestors created the present.

Of course, the people in charge in the 1980’s were not sitting around
thinking, “this is a nice lull in the action, but let’s get going on the
tranny stuff.” The weird thing about the great cultural changes we have
experienced since the end of the Cold War is that no one alive today
asked for any of it. Like the foreign invasion, the cultural changes
were planned behind closed doors by the people in charge. The facade of
democracy is exactly that, a facade. The people were never asked.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
below.

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
