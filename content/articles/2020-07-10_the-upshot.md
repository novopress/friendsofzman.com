I was in the diner picking up my lunch and they had ESPN playing on the
television in the main seating area. They used to have CNN playing
during the panic, but that was when they were not allowed to seat
customers. I’m pretty sure when they were allowed to seat people again,
those people complained about CNN, so they changed it to something they
thought was neutral. The lunch crowd at most places, especially
old-fashioned diners, is going to be old and white.

Of course, ESPN is now hate-whitey all the time. I have not watched the
channel in so long I no longer recall when I last watched it. Probably a
sporting event of some sort back in the before times. While I was there,
they had a parade of famous blacks on to complain about white people.
The absurdity of rich blacks moaning about racism is lost on the blacks,
but I suspect it is not lost on whites. There were more than a few angry
faces looking at the television while they chatted at lunch.

It is hard to avoid your own bias in times like these, but I do wonder
if our rulers have inadvertently created a problem for themselves by
politicizing sports. Watching sports was the last refuge for white
people. There is a pretty strong correlation between interest in sports
and the politicization of society the last three decades. The Cold War
ended, liberal democracy was let off the leash and then everyone crowded
into sports venues to escape the relentless spread of politics.

Of course, with the long sports holiday due to the panic, one that could
probably be extended through the year, that refuge does not exist. Lots
of normal white people with only a passing interest in politics are now
facing the grim reality of what America has become over the last few
decades. The great doses of Soma that was the NFL, for example, are now
going to be the opposite. Instead of putting whitey in a trance, they
will rub in his face the fact that he is now forced to wash the feet.

Again, this could be my own bias at work. A year ago, I would be looking
forward to college football season. It was the last sport I watched with
any regularity. I like the traditions and variety. Now, I have no
interest. They could play the games in my front yard and I’d close the
blinds. I’ve moved past disinterest into outright hatred of the whole
sports entertainment world. The reason is I hate that they have
decorated it with their vulgar and degenerate politics.

Time will tell, but the magic of human society is that twenty percent of
any population is the threshold for change. Self-identified Progressives
are 20% of American society, but they run everything. Muslims are about
15% of France now and they are pushing around the natives. In both
cases, they are well organized, but it just shows how a society can be
ruled by a minority. If 20% of white people are red-pilled by the
current race war, the nature of white people changes in a hurry.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
