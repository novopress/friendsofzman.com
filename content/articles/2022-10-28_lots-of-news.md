With Halloween approaching I thought about doing a special show on the
subject, but then I remembered I did that last year. I then remembered
that it was not just the <a
href="https://odysee.com/@TheZBlog:c/witch-hunting:a?r=3z9tryPnWbnHCsX7miaF2gHZsdDgpVfN"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">greatest Halloween show ever</a>, it was
probably the best podcast ever produced in the history of podcasts. In
retrospect, I should have retired after that show, but like all
champions, I have lingered on too long.

Luckily, the news is providing more than enough content. We have the
war, the midterms, the fatwah against Ye. Next week we will get to see a
million blue checks on Twitter wail in unison over Elon Musk. It looks
like he will start his reign of terror with mass firings, which will be
a good time. This is the season of schadenfreude and the gods of that
concept are going to be generous.

The one sour note will be seeing so many of our guys rush back to
Twitter so they can once again perform for the enemy. Generations of
conditioning have trained them to think they need the attention of lefty
in order to live. They will abandon the various alternative platforms
just so they can carry on like precocious children for their masters on
the other side. It is the slave’s mentality.

It gets at the heart of being a conservative. The whole point of the
enterprise was to get the attention of lefty and one day get him to
agree. It is what Robert Lewis Dabney was getting at with this <a
href="https://counter-currents.com/2012/11/robert-lewis-dabney-on-conservatism/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">famous quote</a>. Going back long before
anyone alive can recall, the people we call the left have been training
their opposition to grovel for the hope of some positive recognition by
lefty.

The people racing back to Twitter will deny this. They will say they are
doing it because they seek a broader audience for our ideas.
Conservatives used to say this long before the internet existed. They
would crawl on their belly to get on lefty talk shows, only to be
humiliated. They would mew about the unfairness of it all, but then
crawl right back at the first opportunity. It was shameful then and it
is shameful now.

It is a reminder that even though someone crosses the great divide to
this side, they bring with them the habits of mind of the other side.
Good salesmen know that you have to keep reselling your accounts in
order to reduce attrition. Dissidents have to accept that crossing the
great divide is just the first step. The initiates need to be
reconditioned to have a positive identity, rather than a negative one.
