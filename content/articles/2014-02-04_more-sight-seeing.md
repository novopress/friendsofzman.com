Driving around Boston, some things caught my attention. One is the use
of difficult to see speed bumps to reduce speeds in residential
neighborhoods. Everywhere on earth, warning drivers of speed bumps is
the civilized thing to do. In fact, civilization is measured by traffic.
Well maintained roads, clear signage and sensible layouts are what you
see in the first world. Outside of civilization, the roads are a mess,
the drivers are crazy and you have no idea what’s around the next turn.
Here’s a good example.

Anyway, driving around Boston, I come upon these massive speed bumps
that look like slabs of side walk on in the street. My buddy warned me
so I saw it, but it was not easy. If you were unfamiliar with the area,
you could easily rip the wheels off your car. There’s little doubt that
the people who installed them did this on purpose. The speed bump is
supposed to be punishment. It’s another reminder that social justice is
just thinly veiled social vengeance on the rest of us by people who hate
us.

Another thing I noticed was a new type of street light. This one would
be red for stop and flashing yellow for go. I’m sitting there, trying to
figure out what that meant when my buddy tells me it is the new green.
The point is to encourage caution, he thinks. There may be a better way
to regulate an intersection than the traditional American scheme, but
that’s certainly not it. That’s stupid. It feels like you’re being
warned by your mother to look both ways or brush your teeth. It’s a
traffic light that nags the drivers.
