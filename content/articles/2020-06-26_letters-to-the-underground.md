We live in an odd time. It is not just what is beamed to us by the
media, but what is happening in the more mundane areas of life. Drive
around the typical business park and the parking lots are empty. Even as
the lock down stuff lightens up, people are not returning to work.
According to the government, over 40 million people have been furloughed
over the last two months. That would explain the empty parking lots, but
it does not explain the busy streets. Lots of people are on the roads.

The working theory is that the people laid off from their work are just
enjoying the extra benefits from the Federal government. The $600 per
week check along with the normal unemployment means they have no
disruption in their lifestyle. Covid has been a very long government
financed vacation. That’s why the parking lots in the business parks are
empty, but the streets are busy during the day. It would also explain
why we don’t have a rush hour in the morning or the evening.

That theory will be tested in August, as the Federal checks are supposed
to run out in July, assuming no extension. Another angle here though is
the people still working are busier than ever. Despite the massive
layoffs, work still goes on and the people not granted the extended
holiday are either working from home or back in the offices doing more
than they did before the shutdown. It is a real life example of the plot
for a
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51233/51233-h/51233-h.htm"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">science fiction story</a>. The
term “working class” now has new meaning.

In my case, I am busier in the day job than ever. So much so that I’m
taking next week off from the podcast just to get caught up. The last
full day I’ve taken off was back in April and I’m not sure of the day.
You make hay while the sun shines as a small business man, so I have no
complaints. It is just another part of the mystery. Forty million out of
work, whole swaths of the retail economy closed for months, but the
people working are busier than ever. No one seems to notice this either.

Even crazier is we have been told since forever that mass unemployment
leads to civil unrest, as people blame the government for the job
losses. The civil unrest we are seeing, however, is people who have
never worked and never intend to work. They are bums, layabouts and
parasites. Their complaint is mostly toward the people who make it
possible for them to remain alive. It is always popular to say the world
has gone mad, but this time it may be more than a figure of speech.

Regardless, I will be taking a week off from the show. That will give me
some time to get caught up on the day job. We are coming up on White
People Independence Day, which is always a slow time for the site. In
fact, the next two weeks have always been the slowest for traffic and
comments. I’m hoping I can get caught up on the day job, so I can then
get back on some other projects I have going. This week I cleared out
the mail bag and inbox, so I’m clean for another month.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
