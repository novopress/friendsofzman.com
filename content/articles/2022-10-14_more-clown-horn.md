There used to be a time when certain pundits would post about the
correlation between economics and election results. They would go to one
of the quantitative guys who modeled these things and then make
predictions based on his model. This was a way for a pundit to pretend
he was smart. George Will perfected this trick back in 1992 when he
consulted a Yale professor whose model predicted a Clinton win.

We do not see much of that anymore. The last time anyone bothered to
make the connection was in the 2012 election. The economic models said
the election should be razor thin, but that was declared *haram*. Obama
was black Jesus and no one would be allowed to cast shade on our dusky
savior. Since then, no one has bothered to talk about economics and
elections.

Even now it is not getting much discussion, despite the fact we have
1970’s style inflation and a crumbling economy. People are feeling the
pain at the cash register, but the real pain lies just after the
election. People seem to get that and will most likely make this known
on election day. On the other hand, the great invisible army of Biden
voters may think everything is great. Who can really know?

Still, you get the sense that the regime is bracing for bad news. They
are feverishly crafting narratives to claim that the bad guys are doing
shenanigans. You see, unlike the 2020 election, this election is under
assault by the forces of darkness who are trying to attack our
democracy! Of course, those forces are led by Donald Trump who must be
arrested now so he cannot attack the 2024 election.

This is life in a theocracy. Putting that aside, there is a sense of
impending doom hanging over the regime media. The economy does feel like
it is on the edge of a cliff due to a number of factors. It is not just
poor management. The old arrangements seem to be failing in several key
areas. The world is slowly turning the page on the 20th century and
America is just waking up to this reality.
