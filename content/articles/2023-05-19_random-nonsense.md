Yesterday, Bernie Sanders, Ed Markey and some other generic senators
from the Democratic Party held a presser with John Fetterman at which
they demanded Joe Biden use the Fourteenth Amendment to raise the debt
ceiling. Fetterman is unable to form coherent sentences and he is unable
to dress like an adult, so he stood around in ratty gym shorts and a
hoodie.

The reason Fetterman was invited is he is a rock star in Washington. As
the first severely brain damaged man to win a senate seat, he is a trail
blazer according to the carny politics of this age. Because he is
mentally incapable of doing anything but utter random words, he is a
unique act on the political stage. His extended time in the lunatic
asylum only added to his novelty.

Politics is nothing more than a carnival act now. The game is to find
some novel way to stand out from the crowd but do so in such a way that
you can plausibly claim to be part of a designated victim group. For a
white guy, the options are limited, as you are assumed to be part of the
oppressor class. Fetterman’s crazy act lets him be a victim and lecture
the rest of as a white man.

That is something we have to consider. His inability to string a
sentence together could be an act. Aphasia is a real thing with stroke
victims, but sociopathy is far more common with politicians than aphasia
with stroke victims. It is possible Fetterman is overdoing the Sling
Blade act as a way to boost his standing. His extended time in the
asylum could simply have been rehearsal time.

That is where we are now with our democracy. We have a guy like John
Fetterman who could be a brain damaged hobo with no business in the
senate. He could also be a faker, pretending to be a brain damaged hobo.
Either way, the carny freaks that dominate politics think it is a great
act. No one dares say that he is an embarrassment to the system because
none of them are embarrassed by him.
