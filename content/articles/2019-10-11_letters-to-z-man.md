I’m on the road so I don’t have much to post here or much time to do it.
As I type this, it is 5:30 PM here in Denmark. I’m expected to meet some
friends in a bit. I did put together a show this week, so this makes me
the hardest working guy in dissident show business, or at least one of
them. I was in a rush when I did this, so it is not the best quality,
but it is not the worst either. Have a great weekend everyone and I will
be doing some more travelogues over he weekend.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
