Hunting around for material this week, I stumbled on some stuff from
Conservative Inc. that reminded me of why so many of us threw in the
towel on them and made the journey to this side of the great divide. It
also reminded me that there are lots of people just starting the journey
from Buckley conservatism or libertarianism. A lot of things readers and
listeners here take for granted, they are just experiencing. It’s why it
is necessary to go back and play the standards once in a while. So, I
have a show about cuck-bashing.

A funny thing I discovered while doing research is that The Weekly
Standard website is now for subscribers only. They used to post their
stuff to the public, but now you need a sub to read their articles. What
that means is my posts now have more readers than anything at the Weekly
Standard. They claim 65K subscribers as of 2012, which is probably down
to 50K now, maybe less. This site gets about 100K unique readers every
month. My heart is an alligator. Let’s hope their numbers continue to
fall.

It’s not all good news. I saw that one of
<a href="https://twitter.com/xan_desanctis" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">the dingbats NRO hire</a>s to churn out pap for them was
on twitter demanding someone be purged. The fact that any young people
still think that crap is edgy or relevant means there is still plenty of
work to be done. Like it or not, the cuck-o-sphere still has a vast
audience for their surrender ideology. That’s why it is important to
keep going over these arguments about the futility of Buckley
conservatism and the danger of subversive neocons like Ben Shapiro.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I’m now on
Spotify, so the millennials can tune in when not sobbing over white
privilege and toxic masculinity.
