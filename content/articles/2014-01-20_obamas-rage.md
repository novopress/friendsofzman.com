To the surprise of no one, President Obama is not <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blaming white people</a> for
his low approval ratings. This was entirely predictable. No black
politician in the last fifty years has passed on the opportunity to play
the race card. The only thing remarkable here is that it took this long
for Obama to start doing it. His use of the race card in his re-election
bid was rather subtle. Of course, he no longer has to worry about
getting white votes now, so he can let his freak flag fly, as the smart
set is fond of saying.

As <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Theodore Dalrymple points
out</a>, politicians are mediocre people with ambition. They succeed
because they have a ruthlessness that allows them to do horrible things
to the other people in their way. That’s what democracy selects for,
which is why every democracy is overrun with sociopaths and lunatics.
Obama was able to rise to the top because he was useful to his backers
and he was willing to say whatever had to be said in order to rise to
the top. Like all politicians, he has no soul.

For Obama, it manifests a bit differently. Blacks in American politics
operate under some different rules than whites. Obama was not getting
anywhere if he walked around with a
<a href="http://www.glamazini.com/images/2007/3.3.Adima.2.jpg"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nappy afro</a> and a pick
sticking out of it. He was never going to get far with the <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Choom-gang look</a> either. In
fairness, a white guy is not getting far if he looks like <a

cannot look like <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Aaron Hernandez</a>. But,
blacks are raised to believe they must act white in order to succeed, so
they rage against this forced adaptation.

Because all politicians are are special form of sociopath, they see
anything less than unconditional love as an unconditional assault. That
means when they fall in the polls, they want to rage against the voters.
For whites, this usually means blaming their advisers or the media. For
black politicians it means blaming that white avatar that always have
hovering over them. For lame duck Obama, fading into obscurity, he is
free to vent his rage against the people who made it possible for him be
in the White House.
