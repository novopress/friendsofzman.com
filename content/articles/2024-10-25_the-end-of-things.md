One of the reasons it feels like the wheels are coming off society is
that we seem to be at the end of things. By things I mean cycles. These
are cultural, intellectual, historical and economic cycles. Some have
played out over generations while some are playing out in a single
lifetime. The result of so many things ending at once is something like
the confluence of several rivers.

Probably the biggest thing coming to an end is the idea of America that
everyone was raised to believe. If you remember the Cold War, then you
probably recall people talking about the difference between America and
the world. It was not just the free world versus the communists.
Europeans would talk about how America was the envy of the world for our
freedom and love of individuality.

We put people in jail now for having the wrong opinions. Our
institutions are so corrupt no sane person trusts anything that comes
from them. The only difference between America today and the Soviet
Union of the 1970’s is that we have vast material prosperity, but that
is bought on credit. The American economic system is a ticking timebomb
just waiting for someone to cut the wrong wire.

People struggle to accept that old America is dying, and this remains a
primary obstacle to changing the trajectory of society. The answer to
the ongoing madness from the people we call the left is some form of “We
just have to go back to…” that can never happen, so we continue to swirl
in the churn of decline. This is often the dynamic with the other things
entering their end phase.

It is why we are cursed with backward thinking. Everyone is obsessed
with rummaging around in the past, like a person searching around for a
lost item, as if there is an answer in the past that will prevent the
inevitable future. One reason no one talks about what comes next is fear
of what comes next. It means closing the door on the past and those past
ideas. The future is a terrifying idea for America.
