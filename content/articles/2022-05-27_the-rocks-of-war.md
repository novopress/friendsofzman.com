Wars often turn over rocks exposing truths about the age that have
either been ignored or hidden from the world. Old tactics, in the case
of the Great War, were exposed as obsolete by modern weapons. Sometimes
it is in war that the hollowness of a great power is exposed. This was
the case of the Soviets in Afghanistan. That war exposed the internal
weakness of the regime. The war in Ukraine is similarly exposing
problems in the collective West.

The first lesson of this war so far is that Western intelligence has
been exposed as useless in understanding modern Russia. At every turn,
the information provided to political leaders about what Russia is doing
and planning to do has turned out to be more fantasy than reality. The
West has been operating on assumptions that may have been true
twenty-five years ago but are no longer true today. The result has been
a total political failure in response to the invasion.

The big example of this was the claim that the Russians could only
support their army in Ukraine for a couple of months. Western strategy
was built on the assumption that the Ukrainians just had to hold out for
a month or two. They would dig into fortified positions and wait out the
Russian assault. Instead, a highly mobile and patient Russian assault is
slowly decimating the Ukrainian army. Three months into the conflict and
the Russians are on the cusp of victory.

This is another rock turned over in this war. The West has been
preparing for a war with a Russian army than has not existed since the
Cold War. The Soviet way of war was something called deep battle
doctrine. This is based on a highly mobile, combined arms approach to
fighting. The Russians would find a weak spot in the enemy front,
concentrate forces there, break through the lines and then flood the
zone with armor and infantry, creating chaos in the enemy rear.

The Soviet approach required large numbers of men. It imagined millions
of men mobilized to fight in the West. This is not the new Russian way
of war. The Russians, like everyone else in the West, have been living
in the age of low fertility and rising standards of living. Mobilizing
millions of men and throwing them into battle like Stalin did against
the Nazis is no longer acceptable. Instead, the Russians have organized
around reducing casualties to the minimum.

As a practical matter, what those hunkered down Ukrainians have been
facing is something like what the Mongols brought to the fight. Instead
of one massive army centrally controlled from the rear, it is a
collection of small units, self contained and self-directed toward
narrow goals. These units combine infantry, armor, mobile artillery and
air support, along with the use of drones. This is combined arms warfare
reduced to small units working independently.

Because these units are smaller, they are more intolerant of personnel
losses, so they are more cautious. A unit that loses its tanks is no
longer effective as a unit, so the premium is on reducing losses. The
goal is to use speed and mobility to find weak spots in the enemy and
quickly exploit them, with minimum losses. Overall, this is a much
slower approach to fighting, but once a weakness is exposed, it can be
exploited much faster due to the improved mobility and flexibility.

This is on display in the Donbas. The Russians used artillery and
airpower to break down the Ukrainian defenses at Popasnaya, which is a
strategic town in the middle of the contact line. The Russians were then
able to rush units into this breech and employ the modern version of
deep battle doctrine. These small units combined to turn the contact
line into a series of pockets surrounded by Russian units. Now the
Russians are pounding these cauldrons with artillery and air power.

The result is the West, primarily Washington, prepared the Ukrainians to
fight the wrong war against the wrong army. Instead of a short defense
against a Soviet siege, they are getting a war of attrition against a
highly mobile and flexible army using the right weapons for such a
fight. That is another aspect of this war that should be a wake up call
to Western planners. The Russian weapons are better and more useful than
the Western weapons supplied to the Ukrainians.

In line with the new way of fighting, the Russians have developed
weapons that can be incredibly useful with small, combined arms units.
They do not require a complex information grid so that commanders in the
rear can direct the action. Modern technology is used to make it easy
for these small units to fight effectively on their own or quickly
combine with other units on the fly. The Russians have also done their
homework and have evolved effective counter measures.

This is why the many “game changers” the West has sent to the Ukrainians
have failed to do much damage to the Russian forces. The javelin has
been a bust. The Man-portable air defense systems (ManPads) are
worthless. The Russians have made these weapons obsolete. The big shock
is their drone defense. The kamikaze drones and the Turkish TB2 have not
been the game changer that was promised because the Russians have
evolved effective jamming tools.

Probably the biggest rocks turned over in this war are economic. The
assumption of the West when they instigated this war was that the
Russian economy had not changed since the end of the Cold War. For a
long time, the West has looked at Russia as a gas station masquerading
as a country. It was a version of Venezuela, wholly dependent on selling
natural resources to the West. If the sale of those resources slowed
just a bit, then the Russian economy would collapse.

This has turned out to be wildly wrong. Now, part of this failure is due
to the raging bigotry of the neocons behind the war. Their seething
hatred for the Russian people has blinded them to many things. The
economic revolution that has taken place in Russia is the biggest one.
It turns out that the Russian economy is much more resilient and
flexible than anyone in the West realized. As a result, the sanctions
regime has turned out to be a disastrous failure.

That has turned over another economic rock. The European economy has
been revealed to be a house of cards. The sanctions regime is creating
havoc for the Europeans, because their economy was based on the
assumption that the Russians would always supply them with cheap
necessities. The EU is a mommy economy where Mother Russia makes sure
her babies are warm and fed. Shortages and spirally prices are bringing
this reality home to Europeans.

In total, what the war in Ukraine is revealing is that the collective
West has been living in a fantasy world for the last few decades.
Without a real challenge, they have been allowed to indulge in whatever
fantasies they liked. Like trust fund babies raised in insular opulence,
Western leaders are unprepared for a world where they have to perform
their role as elites. The war is exposing them as a toxic blend of
self-indulgence, stupidity and ignorance.

The truth about war is that the rocks that it turns over cannot be
turned back over to hide the truth underneath. The West will now have to
face this new reality, especially on the economic front. The grand
schemes for creating a new world order in the image of Western elites
will now have to give way to this new realty. What has been revealed is
that the new world order is one in which the West must compete in a
multipolar world of civilizational equals. That means a new elite for
this new age.
