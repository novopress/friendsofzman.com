Wars are often described in the context of the diplomacy between the
combatants and the battles that make up the war. Today is the
anniversary of the launch of Operation Citadel by the Germans in the
Second World War. This battle was part of the larger
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kursk" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Battle of Kursk</a>, which featured the largest tank
battle in history. This battle, like the war itself, is described by its
various operations. It was decided, however, by decisions made by both
sides long before the battle took place.

It is those decisions made in advance of war that play the biggest role.
The planning of both sides, their assumptions about the other side, as
well as assumptions about the course of the war, are the major factors
in a war. Once the fighting begins, both sides are often swept up in the
action, which is the product of their plans and assumptions interacting
with the plans and assumptions of the other side. Fighting becomes a
machine with a mind of its own.

We see this with the Ukraine war. Before the actual fighting, both sides
were busy preparing for what they assumed would come next. The Russians
amassed about 150,000 men on the border of the Donbas. The Ukrainians
had been preparing a summer attack on the Donbas but switched to
preparing for a defense. Both sides were preparing based on the
assumptions they were making about the other. In the case of Ukraine,
their assumptions were NATO assumptions.

The Russians were the first to move their pieces on the board. They
assumed that the Ukrainians would not want a war. They assumed Europe
would jump in to broker some sort of peace deal based on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk_agreements" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Minsk agreements</a> in 2014. They crossed the border in
Ukraine assuming they would not have to do much fighting. The sight of
Russian tanks outside Kiev would conjure images of war, which would
cause the Europeans to rush to the table offer a peace deal.

This plan was a total failure for the Russians because they were
operating from assumptions about the West that were all wrong. Ukraine
was not interested in a deal and the Europeans would not try to persuade
them because Washington was not interested in a deal. Washington wanted
regime change in Russia, which meant they wanted war with Russia in the
Ukraine. Not only that but the Minsk agreements were a
<a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202212/1281708.shtml"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">deliberate ruse</a> to sucker the
Russians.

In the spring of 2022, the Russians had to rethink everything. This
meant new assumptions and new plans based on those assumptions. This is
when they reorganized their command structure, called up hundreds of
thousands of reserves and embarked on an entirely new strategy for
dealing with the West. The Russians pulled out a blank piece of paper,
wrote down what they knew, what they thought they knew and then built a
war plan from what they had on the paper.

On the other side, the West had been preparing for this war since
Washington overthrew the government of Ukraine in 2014. Their base
assumption was that Russia was too weak to either stop NATO from
expanding into Ukraine or two weak to sustain the effort required to
halt NATO expansion. They would either put nuclear missiles on Russian’s
border or they would get war that would quickly exhaust the Russians,
thus ushering in the planned
<a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB10014.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">breakup</a> of Russia.

At the start of the war, the Ukrainians were faced with the same choices
that faced the Confederacy at the start of the Civil War. When facing a
more powerful opponent, you can either make a daring attack on their
forces hoping to force a truce, fall back into defense hoping to sap
their will to fight or you can look for some way to reduce their ability
to conduct the war. This may mean using unconventional tactics to
destroy their war production and logistics networks.

In the case of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis preferred the defensive
strategy, assuming the North would quickly tire of the war. General Lee
preferred to go on attack, largely based on the same assumption. The
superior field commanders of the South would quickly drive up the cost
of war for the North. Stonewall Jackson, on the other hand, saw the
problem in both strategies. He preferred to attack the North’s
industrial capacity and logistics. Lee won the argument and lost the
war.

Like the Confederates, the West made the same assumptions about the
other side’s willingness and ability to sustain the war. They chose two
of the three options, by waging a sanctions war on Russia to reduce her
capacity to fight and had the Ukrainian army dig in for a long siege.
Even to this day, Western media is predicting that the Russians will
collapse any minute. The long-promised summer offensive was predicated
on this key assumption about the Russians.

In what may go down as one of history’s greatest ironies, the West has
made the same mistake that was made by the Confederacy. It turns out
that the Russians can wage war for as long as it takes to achieve their
goals. Not only that, but Russia also has large untapped resources to
supplement what she had on-hand. As some Western analysist have noted,
the Russians are <a
href="https://cepa.org/article/russias-military-has-improved-the-west-should-take-note/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">stronger</a> now than at the start of the
war. The key assumption of the West about Russia has proven to be wrong.

Once the Russians realized their blunder, they found themselves with the
same choices as the North in the Civil War. They could sue for peace and
accept whatever would come from it. They could ramp up for a massive
offensive against the Ukrainians and accept sizable losses or they could
prepare for a war of attrition aimed at sapping the ability of Ukraine
to maintain her army in the field. The Russians settled on what amounts
to a Slavic version of the Anaconda plan.

The Russians appear to have made three key assumptions. One is they
assumed the West lacked the military industrial capacity to fight a war
of attrition based on artillery and mine warfare. The second assumption
was the West could not replace the Ukrainian air defense system once it
was depleted. This would give Russia control of the skies over the
battlefield. Finally, the Russians assumed that eventually the West
would force the Ukrainians to go on offense using NATO tactics.

The first assumption has proven to be true. The West is running out of
stocks to send Ukraine and has limited ability to produce more. The
American military system is not built for this sort of war. Ukraine uses
in a month what the West produces in a year in terms of artillery
shells. This is a fraction of Russian production. Added to this is the
fact that the Russians are simply better than the West at artillery war.
They have better guns, better training, and better tactics.

The second assumption has also proven correct. At the start of the war,
the Ukrainians had the second-best air defense systems in Europe. The
reason is they were using the same systems as the country with the best
systems, Russia. Again, this is not something in the Western toolkit.
American strategy is to use air power to control the skies, not ground
based missile systems. That missile barrage against power plants was
meant to deplete Ukrainian stocks and it has succeeded.

Finally, the long-awaited offensive by Ukraine is looking like what the
Russians prepared for over the last six months. Like the German army in
the Battle of Kursk, the Ukrainians are running into complex defenses
based on slowing them down so Russian artillery and air power can
destroy them. That plus the extensive use of mines to entangle Ukrainian
forces as they approach has led to scenes like this <a
href="https://gab.com/system/media_attachments/files/141/389/417/original/81f02409570d6bd8.mp4"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">one</a> during the early days of the long
anticipated offensive.

NATO is set to meet this month to discuss where they go next with this
war, so the Ukrainians are desperate to find a victory somewhere to show
them. They are currently back to hurling infantry at Russian defenses
around Bakhmut. Given the Russian understanding of the dynamics of this
war, it is possible that Ukraine wins a battle for a village or two at
some point along the front. The point is to keep driving up the cost to
the Ukrainians in terms of men and material.

To bring us back to where we started, the long promised Ukrainian
counter-offensive is looking a lot like the Battle of Kursk. The
Russians were prepared and understood what they were facing. Like the
Germans, the Ukrainians have misread things and continue to operate from
false assumptions about their opponent. The result is the Russian
anaconda plan is about turn this offensive into Gettysburg. It is a
defeat from which Ukraine can never recover.
