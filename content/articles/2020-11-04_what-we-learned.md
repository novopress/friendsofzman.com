Elections are one of those windows into the nature of a society, like
the roads or public transport systems. It is a manifestation of the real
nature of society. In the case of elections, it is not about the
results, but about how the election is run. Orderly, well run societies
have orderly, well run elections. The results are known soon after the
votes are cast and no one questions them. In disorderly, low-trust
societies, the vote is messy and chaotic and no one takes the results at
face value.

You see that with yesterday’s election. Most people voting remember when
you stopped off to vote on the way home from work or maybe before work.
Office people could vote at their lunch break, because it only took a
half hour at most. In most of the country, even big urban areas, it was
rare to run into long lines or delays. Today, the opposite is now true.
It is rare to experience an orderly, well run polling station. Instead
it is long lines, broken equipment and lots of shenanigans.

Of course, those chaotic voting stations are not able to tally the votes
in a timely manner, so the count carries on for days in some areas. Back
in the days of mechanical voting machines and paper ballots, the vote
was counted in hours. If the polls in a state closed at seven, the vote
was known by nine. Again, there were exceptions, as nothing is perfect,
but they were exceptions. Yesterday’s vote will not be known for weeks
and much of it will be decided in the courts.

Now, one big reason for the delay is the people counting the votes need
time to rig the results in such a way that makes it hard for the courts
to see it. Pennsylvania, for example, is furiously printing up new
ballots for people who did not vote. These will be filled out for Biden
and other party candidates, then dropped off at post offices around the
state so they can be added to the real votes. They now have nine days to
make up enough fake ballots to tip the state to Mumbly Joe.

In states like California, general incompetence rules the day. Since
most of the voters now are foreign born, the results are known in
advance. It’s why no one bothers to campaign in the state. Still, in
order to maintain the fiction of democracy they run elections, but it
takes them weeks to produce a result. Like everything else about the
state, their elections are very third world, which is no surprise as the
majority of the population is from primitive societies. Demographics are
destiny.

It used to be that America would send international observers to a
country to make sure their elections were free and fair. The claim was
the government was either too crooked or too inept to manage an
election, even if they wanted to do it. A gaggle of experts from the
West would be sent in to help organize the voting and make sure
everything was done properly. These international observers would
supervise the counting so that everyone could trust the result.

Now, the shoe is on the other foot. The UN should probably step in and
start supervising American elections, because the government is so
corrupt and incompetent, no one can trust them to run an election. Iraq
now has more orderly and honest elections than most states in America.
Iraq actually requires voters to present an ID and they make voters do
the purple finger thing to prevent ballot stuffing. Maybe the Iraqi
government can send supervisors to Pennsylvania.

In the coming weeks, as this circus drags on in the courts, lots of
people will compare it to the so-called banana republics. That is not
fair, as those banana republics did not ask for democracy. It was
imposed on them. Left to their own devices, they would have been happy
with some form of big-man government. It was Western business that
demanded democracy, so they could more easily exploit these countries.
It is easier to bribe parliamentary mediocrities than an oligarch or
despot.

The United States does not have that excuse. If the people were free of
their depots, tyrants and lunatics, they would revert back to moderate
self-government. The problems faced today are the result of a crooked
and disgusting ruling class. In many cases, the people in charge are
genuinely insane. Gretchen Whitmer is becoming a modern day <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Christian VII of Denmark</a>.
Our increasingly bizarre and corrupt elections reflect the nature of the
American ruling class, not the people.

It is an axiom of the dissident right that democracies always end in
despotism, but that is not really true. After Athens lost the
Peloponnesian War and democracy was suspended in favor of the
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Tyrants"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Thirty Tyrants</a>“, the
people still wanted to return to their natural way of governing
themselves. Eventually those tyrants were overturned and democracy was
restored. The institutions of a people are the product of their biology
and their culture. That is the chain of causality.

In 1787, Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to the son-in-law of John Adams
in which he stated, “The people can not be all, and always, well
informed. The part which is wrong will be discontented in proportion to
the importance of the facts they misconceive. If they remain quiet under
such misconceptions it is a lethargy, the forerunner of death to the
public liberty.” Later he asked, “What country before ever existed a
century and half without a rebellion?” This is a question for us now.

If those words sound familiar, they should. In that [same
letter](https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/tree-liberty-quotation)
Jefferson wrote the famous words, “The tree of liberty must be refreshed
from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is it’s
natural manure.” That is the real lesson of yesterday’s election
charade. The time is soon coming when our petty tyrants will be
trembling in their homes or slithering across the border. These
disgusting piggish buffoons must meet the fate of all tyrants. That’s
what we learned yesterday.
