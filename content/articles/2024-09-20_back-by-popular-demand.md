It has been at least a year since I took a deep dive into the published
works coming from the grievance studies departments. Back when I did
regular Xirl Science segments, I spent a few hours a month perusing the
various journals and aggregators, looking for the most amusing items. If
that is your intent when reading something like
[Hypatia](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/hypatia), the journal
of feminist philosophy, you are spoiled for choice.

Perhaps it has been the long break from reading this material or perhaps
they have continued to evolve, but the material seems different now. On
the one hand, it is less flamboyantly nutty than I remember. There are
far fewer articles that read like satire on the grievance studies
rackets. They still exist, but it is clear that the trends have changed,
and outrageousness is no longer the in-thing.

Instead, the work is more seriously crazy, as in claims that time itself
is a result of oppression and whiteness. They appear to have moved on
from claiming that Western culture is a conspiracy by the pale penis
people to oppress embodied coloredness and people of uterus, to
questioning reality itself. Even though it is loaded with insider
jargon, the point of many papers is to question space-time.

This makes sense when you think about the basis of the project. What
started out as a belief that culture creates people, so therefore those
who “control” the culture create the people to their benefit, must
eventually arrive at the conclusion that reality itself is merely a
product of cultural control. Therefore, the victim of this can only
escape by escaping the reality manufactured by the creators.

There is, of course, a strong whiff of the old gods in this. The culture
is the creation of the white patriarchy in the same way the natural
world is the creation of the Old Testament God. Alternatively, it is a
corruption by white men in the same way Odin and his brothers killed the
true creator in order to rule the world. The point of this “scholarship”
is to return to the original intent of creation.

In other words, all of this stuff, like the liberal project that
proceeded it, operate within the old mental frameworks inherited from
both the Christian framing of existence and the pre-Christian framing.
They discarded the essential bits and have set about producing things to
fill the void of the supernatural. The woke are those most in need of
the old gods searching for a modern version of them.
