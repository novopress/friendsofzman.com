One of things most annoying about modern times is the solipsism.
Everyone is convinced that their ignorance is important. The typical
formulation is something like “I’ve never heard of ….” That is a
response to some statement that contradicts the official narrative. It’s
as if not knowing something makes it go away. Megan McArdle had a
[different
take](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-08-12/only-stupid-people-call-people-stupid)
on this the other day. In the middle of her post she has this summary of
the phenomenon.

*I’m always fascinated by the number of people who proudly build
columns, tweets, blog posts or Facebook posts around the same core
statement: “I don’t understand how anyone could (oppose legal
abortion/support a carbon tax/sympathize with the Palestinians over the
Israelis/want to privatize Social Security/insert your pet issue here).”
It’s such an interesting statement, because it has three layers of
meaning.*

*The first layer is the literal meaning of the words: I lack the
knowledge and understanding to figure this out. But the second, intended
meaning is the opposite: I am such a superior moral being that I cannot
even imagine the cognitive errors or moral turpitude that could lead
someone to such obviously wrong conclusions. And yet, the third, true
meaning is actually more like the first: I lack the empathy, moral
imagination or analytical skills to attempt even a basic understanding
of the people who disagree with me.*

*In short, “I’m stupid.” Something that few people would ever post so
starkly on their Facebook feeds.*

The other stuff about the wrongness of calling people stupid is whatever
you want to make of it. Pointing out the stupid is useful. If we’re not
going to let the stupid eliminate themselves from society, we better do
what we can to identify them. The stupid are always a danger to others.
truth in labeling is vital.

Anyway, way back in the olden thymes, solipsism changed from a character
flaw into a weird defense against uncomfortable facts or opinions. The
simplification of communication through networking platforms like
message boards, Facebook and now Twitter has gifted this idiocy to the
masses. Maybe before the information barrage, it was easy to avoid
people and words that were unwanted. The response to this change in the
human condition is to pretend their can be no thoughts, feeling or ideas
that are not your own. The more we crowd together, the more we become
isolated.
