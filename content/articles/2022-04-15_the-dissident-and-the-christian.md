It is fair to say that this is the worst time for Christians and
Christianity in the West since the Roman empire. In order to promote
equality, liberal democracy has created protected classes of people who
cannot be criticized. The other side of this are people who must me
mocked and ridiculed. Christians were the first group placed in this
category and remain the popular object of ridicule in the West. There is
no prohibition against overt hatred of Christians in most Western
countries.

We are not feeding Christian to lions in gladiatorial pits, but you can
be sure some elements of the ruling class have thought about it. Back in
the Obama years, much of the health care bill was designed to torment
Christians. For example, forcing Catholic groups to pay for abortions
and prophylactics. There was no public health reason for these
provisions. They simply satisfied the demented and sadistic impulses of
the people who put together the program.

In some Western countries, practicing your faith is close to illegal.
Päivi Räsänen is a Finnish politician. She was <a
href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/finnish-lawmaker-being-charged-expressing-religious-views-speaks-out"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">charged</a> with crimes against democracy
for tweeting out a picture of a Bible and quoting it in public. She was
eventually acquitted by the courts, but that was not the point.
Persecution is about the process. This was true under communism and is
even more true under liberal democracy. Hell is being in the control of
ideological fanatics staffing a bureaucracy.

The fact is the managerial elites of the West are not irreligious.
Ideology is just religion that replaces God with man. Our elites are
fanatics for liberal democracy and they will murder anyone who questions
it. Christianity has always been their primary target because the
Christian’s first loyalty can never be to man or the institutions and
ideologies he creates. Liberal democracy, of course, demands absolute
obedience to the state and the people who run the state.

It is not just the secular elites that make war on the Christian. The
big churches have been taken over by the ideologues. Anywhere you see a
rainbow flag it is either a gay bathhouse, a public school or a
Protestant church. The Pope cares more about climate change than the
Catholic faith. Even the Baptists have seen their organizations taken
over by far-left radicals. The great challenge for most Christians is in
finding a church that is not run by a far-left lunatic.

Culture is to a great degree a trickle down affair. The hostility toward
Christianity among the Cloud People has infected the Dirt People. Church
attendance has been in decline for a few generations. Close to 30% of
Americans have no religious identity. This means they have no experience
with religion. About 40% of people who still identify as Christian no
longer attend church. Overall, about 40% of Americans still belong to a
church and attend services on a regular basis.

In Europe, Christianity is just about dead. Only 1.4 percent of the
population of England attends Anglican services every Sunday. Fewer than
one-in-ten Germans say they believe in God. For most Europeans,
Christianity is as alien as Islam. They know nothing about it, other
than what is taught in history class. Given the entrenched self-loathing
that has been imposed by America, Christianity is part of the hated past
where evil Europeans tried to enslave black bodies.

It is not all bad news for Christianity. The faithful are slowly
realizing that for their faith to survive this age, it must live outside
this age. Christians are reverting to what all persecuted minorities
must do. They are learning to live in the shadows and think of
themselves as the outsider. Traditional Catholics seek one another out
and form up shadow communities. Bible study in America is becoming a
private affair organized by small local communities of believers.

These defensive measures are what will form the basis of a revival.
Anything that is open to everyone is valuable to no one. Christianity
was at its most powerful when it was exclusive and required sacrifice
from the believers. One of the main reasons for the decline of the
Western churches is their success. Once it was easy to be a Christian,
it stopped being a powerful force in society. Its return to a
persecuted, underground movement is the only path to renewal.

This presents a challenge and an opportunity in dissident politics. Many
people waving the dissident banner have yet to shed their liberal
disdain for Christianity. Some have manufactured bizarre <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Hoax-Pauls-Fooled-Thousand/dp/197432964X"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">conspiracy theories</a> about the Church.
On the other hand, many sober minded dissidents have soured on their
faith, due to the take over of the churches by liberal democratic
fanatics. One reason many dissidents have soured on the world is they
have seen what happened to their churches.

In America, this is compounded by the problem of evangelical politics.
In the 1970’s, in reaction to the cultural revolution, evangelicals
decided to engage directly with politics in order to get their guys in
office. This was a disaster. Many of the evangelical activist groups
became profitable grifts for the leaders. The pols who took advantage of
the evangelical vote sold out those voters. They convinced believers
that their faith required them to accept liberal degeneracy.

The debacle of Christian political activism cannot be overstated. The
neocons were able to take over largely with the support of evangelicals.
Even now, after the disaster of the Bush years, many of these groups
still care more about Israel than the condition of their own people.
When the typical dissident sees stuff like
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ4pG5t_6ec" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">this</a>, he wants to hoist the back flag and start
slitting throats. It is a reminder of just how easily these people were
turned into weapons against the West.

That said, there is a slow rapprochement between the secular dissidents
and the growing number of dissident Christians. The former is coming to
understand the defining role not just of belief but of structured
rational belief. The latter is coming to terms with the reality of their
situation. For the West to survive and resurrect itself after the
horrors of liberal democracy, it will need a new set of core beliefs,
based in the old ways shaped by the experience of the crisis.

This is where dissident Christians can contribute the most to the cause.
The sin of despair is one of the worst, because it is deliberate. One
deliberately decides that salvation is impossible. It is the state
immediately before suicide. The only reason to be a dissident it to
maintain hope that through the struggle, reason and decency can be
restored in the West. Without hope, the dissident has no reason to
exist, which is why despair must become a mortal sin for dissidents.

You see more and more dissidents and dissident Christians willing to
circulate in the same platforms. Gab has become the social media
exchange for both dissidents and dissident Christians. Nick Fuentes and
his groypers blend dissident political critiques with overt Christian
beliefs. For the first time in a long time church attendance has ticked
up in America. These are grim times for the defenders of civilization,
but we still have hope because that is what must carry us through.

Happy Easter.
