Thanksgiving upon us, posting here will be light, but I will be posting
some content behind the green door.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

By now it is obvious to everyone that Covid has become a bizarre mystery
cult embraced by those into left-wing politics. There are some
exceptions, like the HBD crowd, which was driven mad by Covid. A few
dissidents were gripped by the great fear, but most have recovered. The
bulk of the people hooked on Covid, however, are the sorts of people who
obsess over climate change or check under their beds at night to make
sure Hitler is not hiding there.

The HBD people were driven mad by Covid because it was a reminder of
their exile and the price they have paid for holding bad ideas. This
issue was in their wheelhouse, but their status excluded them from the
conversation. If they had been in good standing, this would have been
their time to shine. Instead, they were left to jump up and down on the
sidelines desperately trying to get the attention of their old friends.
This is the agony that comes with exile.

The Covidian proper is someone who traffics in the usual fads. She totes
her groceries home in grimy canvas sacks because Gaia supposedly hates
plastic. At one time, she had a weird food allergy, maybe a series of
them. The overlap between Covidians and Glutenites is near 100%. Of
course, she was sure that Trump was Hitler and she was also sure
Kavanaugh was going to stuff her uterus full of Bibles. Covid is just
the latest stop on the crazy train for her.

She used to think the problem was too many people. This has been lost to
the mists of time, but the Gaia worshippers started out as hardcore
misanthropes. Mankind was a plague, a virus on the planet that had to be
contained. This was the primary motivation behind unlimited abortions.
These people think mankind is the enemy so anything that is bad for
humanity is good. That is the appeal of Covid. To the Covidian, it feels
like Mother Earth is getting her revenge.

Revenge is a big part of left-wing politics. The Wisconsin massacre was
immediately hailed as revenge for the Rittenhouse verdict. Social
justice, of course, is just a dog whistle for racial vengeance.
Environmental justice, [according to the
EPA](https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/learn-about-environmental-justice),
is where the nonwhite populations exact revenge on white people on
behalf of Gaia. The word “justice” is a universal dog whistle for
vengeance. As a result, the Department of Justice is now the
[inquisition](https://nypost.com/2021/11/16/fbi-created-threat-tags-over-alleged-harassment-of-educators-whistleblower/)
of the new religion.

Covid is not just about the vengeance of Gaia. It is about a general all
around vengeance toward the enemies of the faith. That is what lies
behind the redefinition of words like “vaccinated” and “immunize”. By
redefining these words, it allows the Covidians to exact vengeance on
the unbelievers. It allows the Covidians to retroactively blame the
enemies of the faith for this great plague. It is a witch hunt in which
the witches are doing the hunting.

Of course, vengeance has always been a traveling partner of radical
politics because radical politics is at odds with nature. The great
smashing of the system never ushers in the promised Utopia, so someone
has to pay for it. Covid, however, reveals that the thirst for vengeance
is what draws people into radical politics. Like the bitter,
self-loathing wife beater looking for an excuse to knock around the old
lady, the radical seeks out politics that promise the chance for
vengeance.

There is more to the Covid phenomenon than vengeance. The ritualized
mask wearing and obsession with vaccines suggest there is a mystery
element. There is something magical about all of this that appeals to
the Covidian. Talk to a Covidian and few have a high school level
understanding of biology. They talk about Covid as if it is an evil
spirit, some dangerous miasma. The mask has become a talisman and the
vaccine is a blessing from the shaman to ward of the evil.

This is why women
[insist](https://www.forbes.com/sites/leahcampbell/2021/09/30/covid-symptoms-but-testing-negative-heres-whats-going-on/)
they have Covid despite testing negative. It’s not a lot different than
saying you have been touched by Old Scratch or bewitched by the old
woman who lives in the woods. First, it elevates her status. The evil
one has targeted her for some reason. Second, she is a victim and gets
sympathy. Of course, she is a hero for battling this great plague on her
own. The negative test ties it all together allowing the accursed to
suffer for all of our sins on Twitter.

This is the promise of the new
[symptomless](https://www.bedfordshirelive.co.uk/news/bedfordshire-news/new-symptomless-covid-strain-more-6234566)
Covid. The evil one is so evil that it is now able to infect without
anyone knowing about it. The true believer can now claim to be infected,
but fighting it, even when she has no symptoms and the test comes back
negative for Covid. It also means wearing the proper amulets is now more
important than ever, since spotting the damned is now impossible.
Society will now be reorganized around the beliefs of this new mystery
cult.

Taken together, what Covid has revealed is that something has gone
horribly wrong with Western people. The self-loathing, the thirst for
vengeance and the paralyzing fear of existence all point to a common
cause. The West has reached a point where we hate our very existence. 
We have evolved down a cultural dead end and we have no way to escape
it, so we are hoping for a great destruction. A great plague or natural
disaster is seen as the hope of mankind, because it promises a do-over.

The flip side of this is that Covid and these other mystery cults are
just a way to give purpose and meaning to life. Western society has
arrived at the point where there is nothing left to do but consume. A
species built to compete with the world has conquered the world and is
now left to graze in the fields. Our success is our curse and the price
to be paid is eternal self-torment. Idle hands are the devil’s workshop
and too many idle hands have created this devil we call Covid.
