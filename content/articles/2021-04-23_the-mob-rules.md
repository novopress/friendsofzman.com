Every once in a while, you cannot help but notice that the people who
rule over us are operating like primitives from another age. A great
example is
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDcvPf78g1k" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">this video</a> in which Susan Wojcicki, the head of
YouTube, gives herself an award. The award in this case is for her
support of free speech. While accepting the award, she brags about the
efforts of YouTube to stifle the speech of anyone with whom she
disagrees. You see, slavery is freedom, war is peace, and she is a hero
of free speech.

The amazing bit is where she mentions that her family was chased out of
Poland because they kept saying and doing things the Poles did not like.
She says this experience that she did not actually experience, is what
drives her now to drive people off the internet who say and do things
she does not like. You see, back then it was bad, but now it is good
because she is doing it. More important, she is justified in doing it
because Hitler, which makes everything right.

This is, of course, a primitive mindset. When one band of savages sacked
the village of another band of savages, they would erect their totem.
The presence of their god in the form of that totem made it all good.
Everything was seen in terms of the blood feud, so everything was
justified. The people being savaged had it coming because somewhere in
the past their ancestors did something to deserve it. Today the claim is
the bad people are white, so they deserve whatever they get.

What makes the video amusing is she found a shiksa who is literally
blind to present the award to her. First of all, a blind video maker is
something from a bad script writer or a hacky comic. Putting that aside,
the only person unable to see the absurdity of Wojcicki giving herself
an award is a blind woman. This is Kim Jung-un giving himself
“Humanitarian of the Year” or Nancy Pelosi, after a few jugs of wine,
proclaiming herself the most sober person in Washington.

John Derbyshire used to say there is hope in the comments. This is where
you see that people are not falling for the lies. This is why most sites
have banished their comment sections now. YouTube is about to banish
their down vote button for what you see in that video. There are 116
upvotes from YouTube lackeys and thirty thousand down votes from normal
people. The comments tell the story. Primitive dirt-bags like Wojcicki
can give herself awards, but she is not fooling anyone.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

For sites like this to exist, it requires people like you chipping in a
few bucks a month to keep the lights on and the people fed. It turns out
that you can’t live on clicks and compliments.

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Five bucks a month</a> is not
a lot to ask. If you don’t want to commit to a subscription, make a one
time donation. Or, you can send money to: Z Media LLC P.O. Box 432

**Promotions:** The good folks at
<a href="https://alaskachaga.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer"

readers of this site. You just click on the
<a href="https://alaskachaga.us/discount/ZMAN" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">this link</a> and they take care of the rest. About a
year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
