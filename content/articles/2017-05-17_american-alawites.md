I was googling around trying to remember the name of the funeral song
for Pinochet and I found
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rsb7dT6sEM"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this video</a>. The Chilean
army uniforms got my attention. I could not recall anyone claiming that
Pinochet was Hitler or even antisemitic. Out of curiosity I searched
around for anything on his views regarding the Jews. I found <a
href="http://www.unz.com/pgottfried/eastern-european-jews-and-the-case-of-the-marginalized-elite/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this twenty year old
article</a> from the Jewish World Review. It turns out that the Jews
thought The General was good for the Jews. This bit is what piqued my
interest.

The casual way in which a total lack of national loyalty is mentioned
suggests it is just the way in which Jews view their relationship to the
host country. Whether or not Allende was good or bad for Chile was
inconsequential. What mattered was protecting their property and assets.
There are other countries, after all. It is not the way most people
would look at things. Your patriotic duty would require you to put
nation ahead of personal gain, but more important, where would you go
even if you threw in the towel on your country?

Jews have always been accused of having dual loyalties and the charge is
not without some merit. It’s also not without good cause. After all, if
you are a tiny minority living in lands where the host population is
often less than welcoming, a high degree of clannishness is a necessary
tool for survival. That loyalty to the group over all else naturally
means a lack of loyalty to the host population. Both Jews and gypsies
have managed to thrive as tiny minority groups, largely because of
intense group loyalty.

Of course, clannishness is a bit easier when the host population is
hostile. In America, the host population has always been indifferent to
Jews. The first wave that came over in the 19th century largely blended
in with the locals. In areas where they maintained a unique cultural
identity, German Jews tended to conduct themselves like the WASP elite.

of stuff on Jewish golf club culture</a> and the divide between the
first wave German Jews and the second wave eastern Jews.

If hostility from the majority helps minorities maintain group loyalty,
then the lack of hostility works against it. In modern America, there’s
no such thing as Irish or Italian culture anymore. It has been
commercialized and homogenized out of existence. It is why Jews work so
hard to perpetuate the idea that they have faced terrible discrimination
in America, despite all the evidence to the contrary. Maintaining the
belief that the goyim are about to go full blown Nazi at any minute
helps maintain group solidarity.

The thing is though, Jews are not a minority living on the fringes of
American life. A scan of who controls the high ground in America shows
that <a
href="http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Terra-Incognita-The-20th-century-was-the-Jewish-century-470293"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jews are wildly over
represented in the law, culture, media and finance</a>. It really is
quite incredible. Close to half of the owners of pro sports teams are
Jewish. Roughly 85% of Jews attend college and <a
href="http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/income-distribution/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">44% of Jewish households</a>
earn $100,000 or more.
<a href="http://www.arthurhu.com/index/jewish.htm"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The statistics are rather
incredible</a>, when you consider that Jews are just 2% of the
population.

American policy makers struggle to understand why Bashar al-Assad of
Syria tenaciously hangs onto power. He has been offered a deal to leave
Syria and live out his life in luxury somewhere in the West. Instead, he
fights and his people fight, despite being outnumbered by the Sunnis.
The Alawites are just 12% of the population, but they have been able to
dominate Syria largely by remembering they used to be an oppressed
minority. There was a time when Alawites had no legal rights. Righteous
indignation is a powerful weapon.

This is relevant to Jews in America because they have manufactured a
history of oppression in America as a way to maintain group loyalty and
cohesion. This not only allows them to prosper, but it is a strong
motivation to be wary of anything resembling group loyalty anywhere
else. In a country that is becoming increasing fragmented, and headed
for majority minority status, this will eventually be seen as hostility.
Put another way, what has so far been good for the Jews could turn out
to be really bad for the Jews.

Whether or not that’s how things unfold is hard to know. The appearance
of “renegade Jews”, the term David Horowitz applied to Bill Kristol,
could be a sign that Jewish identity and group loyalty is breaking
apart. The whole neocon experiment looks increasing like a suicide cult.
The folks at Commentary Magazine may be ready to close the books on
mankind, but it is unlikely the rest of the Tribe is ready to join them.

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The paranoia over Chabad</a>
suggests group loyalty is not holding up.

The world is ruled by numbers. The Syrian Alawites have used cunning and
ruthlessness to rule over the majority population. The American Alawites
have used superior cognitive skills and the generosity of an open
society to occupy the high ground in culture, politics, finance and the
law. Maybe that’s enough and it is the natural order of things. The
grinding war in Syria, however, suggests otherwise. But, Assad remains
in power and the Sunni remain divided, so maybe numbers are not
everything.
