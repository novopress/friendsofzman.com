In modern times, the popular culture is geared toward looking down in
the gutter for examples. Every social pathology is celebrated as
authentic and realz. That means black culture is dominant or at least
everyone pretends that it is the greatest thing since pockets. Reality
is always something different these days and it occasionally peaks
through the cloud cover like when football legend <a

act white</a>.

*Charles Haley is the only player in NFL history who’s been a part of
five <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Super Bowl</a> winning teams, so it was no surprise in
May when one of those teams, the
<a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/page/SF/san-francisco-49ers"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">49ers</a>, asked him to speak to their
rookies.*

*What might come as a surprise to some people though is what Haley said
to those 49ers rookies.*

*“As far as the rookies, and I know they probably got mad, but I said,
‘Why don’t you all act like the white guys? You never see them in the
paper getting high or hitting people,” Haley said, via the <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">San Jose Mercury News</a>. “‘Why don’t
you act like that?’ They all looked at me crazy.”*

*The 51-year-old Haley wasn’t necessarily trying to be controversial
with his comments, he was just trying to get the attention of a bunch
rookies — Something that’s much easier said then done in this age of
cell phones, Twitter and Instagram.*

*“I just did it for the shock value of it,” Haley said. “The hardest
thing is these guys, they have an attention span of a 5-year-old. I’m
not the most gentle and kind person to sit there and deal with that
crap. I’m a little more confrontational. I think I got my point
across.”*

He’s right, of course. White athletes get in far less trouble than black
athletes and it is because the blacks guys have the self-restraint of
children. One thing that you notice living in the ghetto is that black
males stop maturing at around 12 and stay that way until they are
murdered, go to jail or magically make it into their 40’s. The later
group usually gets deadly serious about life at that point.

Segregation had a lot of problems for whites and blacks, but it did not
spring from nothing. The historical record has been re-imagined, but in
the original many blacks in the South liked segregation. They correctly
saw that the rules on behavior benefited the black community, especially
women. The trade-offs were not just, but there were trade-offs, which
means some benefits.

Attempts to create a shaming culture such that successful older black
males can shame young black males into behaving properly has been short
circuited by Progressives, but it is probably the only reasonable
compromise. Put another way, you cannot have a multi-ethnic society
unless the people at the top of the various ethnic groups agree on the
high culture and enforce it amongst their own. That means old black guys
telling young black guys to act white.
