**Note:** The Monday
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/a-moral-battle/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Taki piece</a> is up and the topic is the moral
dimension to the ongoing social war. There are a few new items up behind
the green door as well.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The “Black and Tans” were a police force recruited by the British into
the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) as something like a paramilitary
force or a militia during the Irish War of Independence. The majority
were unemployed former soldiers who fought in the Great War, but many
were criminals and even prisoners. They got their nickname from the
uniforms they wore. They were supposed to help the overstretched RIC
maintain order and deal with the Irish Republican Army.

In reality, they were something like a mob of thugs unleashed on the
Irish population as a form of state sponsored terrorism. While most had
military training, there was no code of conduct to control their
actions. They were known for their brutal tactics and their
indiscriminate attacks on civilians in retaliation for IRA attacks on
them. Because the men recruited into the ranks were young and had few
prospects at home, they were happy to do whatever was asked to the Irish
population.

This is a useful historical example to keep in mind when reading this
<a href="https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Time article</a> on how the oligarchs
rigged the 2020 election. Most people have fixated on the audacity of
posting such a piece. Usually, people who commit crimes try to conceal
their actions, but in this case, the principles are willing to boast
about it. We are in the midst of a great purge of our institutions of
anyone who questions the legitimacy of the election and here we have
these people confirming many of the claims.

The motivation behind writing that piece is spite, of course. The
half-hearted talk of bringing unity after the election has not fooled
many people. That Time piece makes clear that there can be no unity,
because there will be no peace. As the article says, the point of
rigging the election was to “fortify” what they call democracy, but
which the rest of us call their permanent rule. They were prepared to
use any means necessary to defend their rights and privileges from the
people.

One of those tactics, of course, was the unleashing of mobs onto the
public starting with the highly orchestrated George Floyd incident. This
was a combination of Black Lives Matter, created by the Obama
administration during his second term, and ANTIFA, created and funded by
the Soros organization. One group allegedly represents the interest of
blacks, while the other group claims to be the inheritors of the
communist revolutionary spirit. It was blacks and reds.

This is the truly remarkable aspect of that post. For months, the
evidence piled up suggesting the mobs were manufactured. There seemed to
be someone or a group of people funding and directing them. Early in the
Time story, it boasts “In a way, Trump was right. There was a conspiracy
unfolding behind the scenes, one that both curtailed the protests and
coordinated the resistance from CEOs. Both surprises were the result of
an informal alliance between left-wing activists and business titans.”

In other words, the suspicions were correct. The left-wing terror
networks that operate out of not-for-profits like Pro Publica and The
Bail Project, funneled cash, supplies and instructions to the mobs on
the streets. That cash came from the CEO’s and their money changers in
Washington, Silicon Valley and New York. This money was offered in
exchange for violent street actions intended to either provoke a
right-wing reaction or embarrass the Trump administration.

This sounds a lot like what the British did in Ireland. Unable to win
popular support in their crusade against Trump, they unleashed thugs
with official protection to terrorize the population. State sponsored
terror is a well-known tactic to control a population, but it is
generally considered the bane of civilized government. This is the sort
of thing you expect from authoritarian societies or occupied ones. It
was something the Bolsheviks did after the revolution, which is ironic
given the people involved.

A century ago, the Irish Republican Army figured out that winning the
hearts and minds of the people made British occupation expensive. When
the British could not recruit Irish into the police force, they brought
in the thugs that became known as the Black and Tans. These thugs only
made it easier for the IRA to win the public over to the cause and the
IRA was quick to take advantage of it. Eventually, the British had no
choice but to abandon the tactic and disband the unit.

Here in modern America, the situation is different, at least for now, so
the Black and Reds are seen as effective. They have not been officially
disbanded by the ruling regime, even if they have been sidelined.
Recently, Antifa turned up in Washington, harassing diners and fighting
with the police. They will no doubt be out this summer causing trouble
along with Black Lives Matter. Unlike the Black and Tans, they have not
been promised pensions or positions in the government.

Even so, it is a useful comparison. The British unleashed the Black and
Tans because they did not see the Irish as humans. They were a
population that had to be controlled, like wild animals or maybe
prisoners. The people on the other side of the razor wire and in the
bunkered communities of Silicon Valley and Wall Street look at the rest
of us, especially the white population, the same way. We are no longer
humans, so they are free to do as they like in order to control us.

The lesson is that in a social war, every event must be used to rally
support for your side and put the other side in a bad light. The Black
and Tans undermined the British position with both the Irish and British
public, because the IRA made them the face of the British occupation.
That is what must happen here. These mobs must be closely tied to the
CEO’s and politicians directing them. The Biden presidency must be known
as the Antifa presidency. Make them own their golem.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
