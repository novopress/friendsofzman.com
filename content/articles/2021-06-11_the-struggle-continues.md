This week has been nothing but a struggle. For some reason, the PC I use
to record the show reconfigured itself one night. That meant all of my
audio settings were set to the default. That meant I had to spend too
much time relearning how to set them back to what I prefer. I think I
got them back to pretty much where they need to be, but the audio may
sound a little weird in places.

It was also hard finding material that I found interesting. Maybe it is
just the summer doldrums setting in early, but life seems boring of
late. Part of it is the media is busy making the Vegetable-in-Chief
sound like a statesman, which is far less exciting than it sounds. The
novelty of having a dementia patient in the White House has worn off and
we are left with the reality.

That reality is that there was never any reason for Biden to be
president, other than he was the only option they had to replace Trump.
Once he scrawled what he thinks is his name on the executive orders they
put in front of him, there was nothing left on the agenda. The long
temper tantrum no longer has a reason, so the stasis of late empire
decline is back, which means nothing happens.

The only potential for something interesting to happen is if they snuff
out the vegetable and install Harris. She is revealing herself to be
dumber and shallower than anyone imagined. She is fumbling the softest
of questions from the most obsequious of reporters. It seems impossible,
but she may have less cognitive function than her boss and he is close
to brain dead.

All that said, in clown world there is always another act warming up
off-stage, so something will come along to provide content. Now that the
Covid restrictions are lifting, all of the pent-up mayhem from our
vibrant community can blossom. At some point, the media will have to
take notice of that reality. Even conservatives are starting to notice
that diversity may not be a strength.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
below.

**Promotions:** The good folks at

readers of this site. You just click on the

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
