It appears that the Islamophobia monster is still loose. Thankfully, the
nutters from the Cult of Modern Liberalism have found some new <a

*Comedy has always had the unique ability to cut to the core of a
cultural divide and lay it bare for a laugh.*

*Comedians like Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor and George Carlin long ago
solidified the standup stage as an unlikely venue for confronting social
issues and challenging public perception.*

*Now the co-founders of the

and Maysoon Zayid, want to use it to change the conversation about
Muslims in America. They sat down with Yahoo global news anchor Katie
Couric at the

York City.*

*“I really feel like it’s a great equalizer,” says Zayid. “Because if
you can get people laughing, they stop thinking of you as an ‘other.’
And I think that’s where the power in comedy is. It’s to take things
that otherwise make people uncomfortable and instead make them laugh.”*

I have a friend who is convinced he is a libertarian, but he is a
standard issue moonbat from Massachusetts. Immediately after 9/11 and I
mean hours after it, he posted on his website a long plea to avoid
rounding up Muslims and putting them into camps. His \#1 concern was not
the smoking hole in the middle of New York City. No, he was more afraid
of his fellow citizens, his neighbors.

Despite decades of Muslim terrorism all over the world, there’s been no
backlash against Muslims anywhere. That does not stop the Cult from
pretending so they just pretend that Muslims are being oppressed by
Americans. They are forever vigilant, looking for any signs that
Islamophobia is about to break out.

One of the great debates on the fringe (and even on the conventional
right) is about whether Progressives really believe the things they say
in public. It’s probably best to frame it as a long running debate
dating back generations, maybe all the way back to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Civil_War" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">1642</a>. I’ve been reading a lot about the English
Civil War and it is tempting for me to date a lot of this stuff to that
period.

I wish I had a nickel for every time some popular man of the Cult gave a
speech making claims that were obviously false. Even allowing for
personal bias and perspective, Progressives often say things that are
completely insane. Obama’s nomination speech is an obvious example:

*Because if we are willing to work for it, and fight for it, and believe
in it, then I am absolutely certain that generations from now, we will
be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when
we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless; this
was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet
began to heal; this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our
nation and restored our image as the last, best hope on earth.*

When hearing that, normal people wondered how he and his audience did
not burst out laughing. Political hyperbole is to be expected,
particularly after a big election, but that’s the sort of thing that
used to get people committed. Did he really believe his election would
alter the earth’s climate? Found a new nation in place of the current
one? Is it possible for one man to be full of so much shit?

The thing that was clear with my moonbat friend was that he really
believed Americans were pulling out their torches and boiled rope after
9/11. It’s what normal people have always got wrong about Progressives.
It’s not an act. These people are the truest of true believers. Katie
Couric really does worry that the great backlash is upon us.
