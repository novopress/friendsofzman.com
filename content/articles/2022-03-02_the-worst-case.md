It is assumed that the worst case scenario for the Russo-Ukrainian
conflict is the direct or even indirect involvement of NATO in Ukraine.
If NATO forces came into direct conflict with Russian forces, the result
would be total war and total war could easily and quickly lead to
nuclear war. This is a remote possibility as NATO has been adamant about
not getting militarily involved. The West is content to use the economic
weapons at its disposal that it assumes the Russians have anticipated.

While there is nothing worse than nuclear war, the fact that it is the
least likely outcome means it is not the worst probable outcome. The
fact is, the Cold War was a good lesson in the use and non-use of these
weapons. Nuclear weapons are last resort defensive tools. A nation will
use them as a last gasp at survival. This is why Israel stole the
technology from America in the last century. It is why North Korea is
developing the ability to deliver a nuke to North America.

If nuclear holocaust is off the table and a wider scale war in Europe is
off the table, then that leaves the softer, less predictable outcomes.
We are already seeing big ripples in the financial markets as people try
to figure out the downstream consequences of the economic sanctions on
Russia. Despite what the media may claim, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine
are not hermit kingdoms. They have a lot of economic links to the rest
of the world and are a vital part of the global supply chain.

For example, one bottleneck in the chip supply chain is in Ukraine. The
world has just started to turn the tide on the chip shortage, but now a
vital bottleneck has been closed due to the war. Optimistic predictions
said the chip shortage would be over by the end of 2022, but now that
date is pushed well into the future. Everyone in the dreaded private
sector knows the mischief caused by the chip shortage. That mischief is
now going to play out for a much longer period than expected.

That last part is where to focus. Economics is about expectations.
People will stock up on something, for example, if they anticipate a
shortage or price hike. On the other hand, people will take risks in
good times, risks like starting a business, buying a new home or hiring
new staff. A massive amount of risk has been dumped into the global
economy as a result of this war and the response from the West. For the
first time in a long time everyone has a reason to not take any risks.

On the more tangible side, energy prices are spiking at a time when we
have spiraling food prices globally. The last time this happened there
was civil unrest throughout the Middle East and North Africa. The
so-called Arab Spring was marketed as a quest for freedom but it was a
revolt over food and fuel shortages. It is good to remember that the
same people who sold those results as a positive are the ones
responsible for the mess in Ukraine and responsible for managing the
fallout.

Ten years ago, the Arab Spring was watched in America during a time of
historically low inflation and interest rates. The population was fairly
content. Today, America has double-digit inflation and is now about to
get an energy cost spike. The population is also at each other’s throats
because the people in charge are sure one half of the population are
evil insurrectionists. A global depression is not going to help sooth
the social tensions that exist in Western nations.

Wide-scale supply chain and financial disruptions is probably the rosy
scenario end of this conflict in Ukraine. Shippers are already
hesitating to take on Russian products, even those products are not
sanctioned. It is conceivable that deliveries of vital natural resources
like fertilizer, food and energy from Russia, Belarus and Ukraine will
be delayed for the next several months. These countries ship a lot of
food to the global south, so it is a profoundly serious problem.

If that is not enough to consider, think about the last time waves of
men flooded into Europe from the south. That was largely driven by
economics. Given the socio-economic mood in Europe right now, how well
will they handle a million men marching into the heart of Europe from
the Middle East and Africa? Who will be blamed this time for the
demographic calamity that would follow? Far-right candidate Eric Zemmour
could end up sounding like a moderate.

The global order that the West, led by the United States, has evolved
over the last several decades assumed certain things. For example,
populism was assumed to be impossible in a system that efficiently
delivered quality consumer goods. It assumed that price shocks were a
thing of the past. Similarly, inflation was assumed to be controlled by
the judicious control of the money supply. It assumed the free flow of
goods, capital and information.

The system struggled to contend with the populist revolts of the last
decade. Two years of mismanagement of the Covid crisis have brought
populism back to the fore and called into question key economic axioms.
We have labor shortages all over the place, despite rising wages, but we
also have spiraling inflation. This is at a time of historically low
interest rates. Prior to the war, this combination was assumed to be
impossible and now it will only get worse as a result of the crisis.

When the axioms of a system begin to crumble, people quickly begin to
doubt the system that rests on those axioms. Confidence in the
socio-political order was already falling as a result of demographics
and mismanagement. The banging of war drums by the geriatrics ruling
Washington is not going to change this. In fact, it is clear that the
public blames those geriatrics for the Ukrainian mess. We are entering
uncharted territory with regards to public confidence in the system.

It very well may be that the worst case scenario is upon us with regards
to the Russo-Ukrainian conflict. A fragile system that was already
wobbling due to demographics and mismanagement is now about to receive a
series of economic body blows. Europe may be getting a new wave of
demographic reality. The worst case scenario may be a revolution in
public consciousness about the socio-economic order. The elites may be
blowing their world up the old fashioned way.
