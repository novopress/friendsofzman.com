------------------------------------------------------------------------

It has been noted many times now that people in the West have to read
American media the same way they used to read the Soviet media. Most of
what we get from mainstream sources is the natural propaganda one
expects from the toadies and bootlickers that follow every authoritarian
regime. Other pieces are planted by regime elements for reasons that are
not always obvious. As with Kremlinology a generation ago, regime-ology
is something of sport now.

For example, the regime keeps planting these stories about an imminent
Russian invasion of Ukraine in their favorites outlets. A few days ago
this entirely made up <a
href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-military-intel-50k-casualties-russian-invasion-ukraine-2022-2"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">report</a> was sprinkled all over regime
media. It painted a grim picture of the attack that we are told was
happening any minute. Of course, the White House comes out <a
href="https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/russia-might-invade-ukraine-soon-tomorrow-white-house"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">every day</a> and tells the stenographers
in the press pool that the Russians will invade Ukraine as soon as
tomorrow, but tomorrow never comes.

Today we have the latest regime
<a href="https://archive.is/pk6rr" rel="noopener" target="_blank">scare
story</a> written by one of the zombies at their favorite outlet. The
point of this story is to embarrass French President Emmanuel Macron who
is trying to work out a deal with the Russians. He has been meeting with
the parties the last two weeks to put an end to the situation. Unlike
the Washington regime, Europe has no interest in war over Ukraine. The
Europeans can read a map and they are not insane.

For a long time, it was assumed that the reason for the war drums from
Washington was due to so many pols being on the Ukrainian payroll. We
know the Biden family has been taking bribes from Ukraine for over a
decade. That was one of those interesting stories that arose from the
second impeachment of Trump. This tiny little corrupt country in Eurasia
had a lot of friends in both political parties. The best sort of
friends, the kind that can be bought and will stay bought.

That may be part of it, but it is clear that the Ukrainians have no
desire to be the battleground in a new Cold War. For their part, the
Russians have made clear they will never tolerate Ukraine in NATO. This
should be an easy demand to meet, as no one in NATO, other than the
Washington regime, wants Ukraine in NATO. Everyone in Europe understands
the reality of Ukraine. It is a hyper corrupt kleptocracy that would be
better off turned into a federalized neutral zone.

The other aspect of this is that the stories about the Russian military
buildup appear to be mostly fake. The Russians are free to conduct
exercises in their own land, which is what they have been doing thus
far. They have not been sending weapons or “advisers” to the friendly
militias operating in Ukraine. The CIA has been conducting covert
operations with friendly militias for a decade now. In other words, this
whole thing is one long running color revolution.

That raises the obvious question. If no one in Europe wants a war over
Ukraine and the Ukrainians are not interested in a war, what is really
going on here? One option is the permanent foreign policy establishment
is infested with paranoids who wake in the middle of the night to the
sound of hoofbeats. That has been an amusing line for years, but it
would be a terrifying reality. Is the Ukraine mess really the result of
deranged fanatics operating in the Washington foreign policy
establishment?

Another less terrifying option is energy. The one thread that ties the
foreign policy misadventures of the last thirty years together is
energy. Russia has partnered with Iran and Syria because of energy. If
they can control of natural gas out of the Middle East into Europe, that
gives them leverage. Nord Stream 2 is a regular <a
href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-nord-stream-2-oil-pipeline-779970ee17f6fa9d0fa2996e45cbeab9"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">topic</a> for the regime media, so it is
fair to assume that the regime is worried about it. In this context,
Ukraine is just a convenient cat’s paw in a larger geopolitical game.

What the regime is hoping for is an invasion of Ukraine that would then
force the Europeans, especially the Germans, to kill Nord Stream 2. The
Russians would remain the primary supplier of natural gas to Europe, but
they would not become the exclusive supplier of energy. If Nord Stream 2
comes online Washington loses most of its leverage over Europe with
regards to Russia. This is why they are so committed to this narrative
about a Russian invasion. It has to happen.

The problem with this scenario is that it is too late to kill Nord
Stream 2. The pipeline is complete and filled with gas. The last step in
the project is for Germany to start using the gas and pay the Russians
for it. No sane person can imagine a scenario in which this project is
shut down. Even an invasion of Ukraine by Russia would only delay the
opening of the pipeline. The Germans want the gas, the Russians want to
sell it to them, so that deal will be consummated no matter what.

One interesting side bar to this is that the regime is certain they can
jawbone the Russians into invading Ukraine. They also seem to think they
can convince the world that a war is imminent. It is one of those
examples where the regime reveals how disconnected they are from
reality. Exactly no one seems to be falling for this disinformation
campaign, especially the Russians. Yet the regime keeps running these
stories in their media as if they are working.

As was the case with Kremlinology, we are left with our best guesses as
to why the Washington regime is hyper-aggressive toward Russia. It could
simply be cultural momentum within the foreign policy establishment. No
one inside the regime knows why they have to talk about Russia as the
great villain. It has just been the way it has always been. No one
questions it, so the cultural inertia inside the system just keeps
pushing the political class into confrontation with Russia.

That is the problem with closed regimes like we have in Washington. No
one can see inside to figure out what is happening. Everyone inside sees
everyone outside as a possible enemy, so no one talks candidly about
what is happening. Everything operates inside of a black box. No one
sees in and no one sees out. To the outside the world, the regime looks
increasingly paranoid and dangerous. Eventually, it burns through its
legitimacy and we arrive at a
