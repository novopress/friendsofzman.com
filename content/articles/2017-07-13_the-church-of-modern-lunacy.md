I have a passing interest in the Church of England and its American
variation, the Episcopal Church. An old friend is in the church so I get
some first hand descriptions of what it is like to be in a dying
institution. That’s the only way to describe the Episcopal Church.
Attendance declines every year as old members die off and new members
never materialize. Go into an Episcopal service and you can’t help but
notice that most everyone is a senior. The actuarial tables are the
church’s greatest enemy.

Of course, church attendance has always skewed a little older. Young
people tend not to be attracted to the faith, even if their parents
regularly attend services. As people get older, have families and begin
to sink roots, they get more involved in their faith and attend services
regularly. That’s the trouble with the mainline Protestant religions.
The young are not coming back once they start having families. That
means their children are not raised in the faith. As a result, these
churches are now in a death spiral.

The story is familiar to anyone who has been paying attention. These
churches made the decision to chase the latest social fads in the 70’s
and 80’s, hoping to make themselves more appealing to the young. The
only thing they did was make themselves less attractive to people
interested in being part of a traditional Christian sect. It was not
just in the pews, but in the clergy as well. Those feeling the call
found that the church in which they were raised was not interested in
defending and maintaining the faith.

The result is the clergy slowly radicalized. First came the women and
then the feminist women. Soon they invited in the homosexuals and the
clergy started looking like the faculty of a liberal arts college.
That’s when the pews started to empty out. Why bother going to church,
when you can get the same liberal lecture from television? That’s what
started the decline in church attendance. Instead of offering a shelter
from the storm, they decided to chase an over-served market – radical
Progressives.

Talking to my friend, he tells me that there are elements within the
Episcopal Church that know what must be done to save the church. The
trouble is they are outgunned and out maneuvered by the radicals. That’s
the thing. The conservatives make it a priority to serve the church and
serve God, while the radicals are always scheming to advance the radical
agenda. The conservatives are constantly outmaneuvered because they are
not playing the political games. They end up getting marginalized,
despite having numbers.

Of course, young people seeking to join the clergy are confronted by a
politicized bureaucracy full of homosexuals and social justice warriors,
who are mainly interested in advancing their own agenda within the
church. Like the old commie radicals of yesteryear, the current radicals
use struggle sessions and purity tests to boil off those who would
challenge their agenda. Imagine you’re a young priest and you are told
you now have to <a

Notice the feminine language. They want to “welcome and affirm” trannies
into their churches. I’d like these guys to point to the passage in the
Bible that covers men who like to play dress up or people so mentally
unbalanced they believe their sex organs are imaginary. Ministering to
the mentally ill has a place in a church, but that’s not what they are
saying. They want to make mutilating people a sacrament. Imagine being
forced to embrace this sort of madness. It is no wonder the sane clergy
are leaving.

Of course, it’s also why the pews are empty. It’s another reminder that
Progressives must be treated like rage zombies or highly contagious
disease carriers. Once you let one into your organization, it will set
about bringing in more of its kind. In this case, it was women in the
clergy, then feminists, then homosexuals. They have reached the point
where few inside the church care at all about the faith. It’s all about
the latest Progressive fads and how they can outrage the remaining
members of their congregations.
