seeing in the political climate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What has gotten the most attention on this side this past week is the
hypocrisy by the ruling class and their histrionic flunkies in the media
over the peaceful protest in the Capitol last week. The first response
of normal people is to note how the same people raging about these
protests were celebrating violent riots in the summer. In what remains
of the internet, people have been posting examples of people in politics
or the media saying the exact opposite of what they said a few months
ago.

Normal people have been programmed to think hypocrisy is important, even
though it is clearly not important to the people in the ruling class.
Normal people are taught that a civil society operates by a clear set of
rules that apply to everyone. When the people in the ruling class have
one set of rules for normal people and a different set of rules for
themselves, normal people get mad. The ruling class, however, does not
care, as there is one set of rules for them and another for the rest of
us.

This focus on hypocrisy has left something unnoticed. That is the
increasingly overwrought behavior of our rulers. They have become a
collection of hysterical drama queens, who carry on like the world is
about to end. This is the one thread connecting all of the insanity we
have experienced from our rulers recently. Their reaction is wildly out
of proportion from what is expected. The actual news, when you think
about it, is always about their emotionally charged reaction to mostly
normal events.

If we go way back to the 2016 election, the political class reacted as
if the most important man in history had come out of his cryogenic
chamber in Paraguay and seized control of the government. Instead of
analyzing why it was there preferred option was rejected and making the
normal adjustments, they concocted wild fantasies about invisible
Russians and carried on like teenage girls for four years. It has
already been forgotten, but they really believed that Russia stuff.

The Covid stuff is another great example. The local tyrants have used
this minor public health issue to feature themselves in a drama of their
own creation. In this story, they are heroically fighting the great
virus enemy. They are rallying the people in a great cause to prevent
the extinction of mankind. The media slavishly reports on their great
deeds as if they are out slaying dragons or facing the Black Knight. The
buffoonish governor of New York even had a book written about his
heroism.

What should be a minor public health issue has been turned into a great
drama acted out by emotionally unstable people. According to the CDC,
over 250 million people have been tested with 22 million confirmed
cases. Total deaths in 2020 were in line with what you would expect,
given the country’s demographics. A little higher due to Covid and a
little higher due to the reaction. Sober-minded people would have
treated this as a very bad flu season. Our hysterical rulers treated it
as the end times.

The most recent example of the overwrought behavior by our rulers is the
reaction to the protest last Wednesday. The “storming of the Capitol”
was really just a bunch of people walking past the cops and going inside
the building. Sure, juvenile pranksters livestreamed themselves doing
shenanigans, but other than the Pence aide murdering Ashli Babbitt, it
was nothing more than a frat house prank. It was nothing like the
Kavanaugh protests just a short time ago.

The reaction by the rulers is as if a rebel army laid siege to the
Capitol and set fire to most of the city. [The
FBI](https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2021/01/09/law-enforcement-cast-wide-net-for-capitol-attack-suspects-four-men-arrested/)
has been tasked with hunting down, in the most dramatic way, all of the
protestors. [Their media
lackeys](https://twitter.com/samjmintz/status/1347317087711211521) are
now calling the Capitol protestors “insurrectionists” and demanding they
be destroyed. Instead of calling it a protest, they are calling it a
siege. Again, the image is of a foreign army attacking the center of the
empire, like the Gauls sacking Rome in 387 BC.

For the inauguration they have now deployed army and national guard
units. The [media
lackeys](https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/dc/armed-national-guard-troops-arriving-from-six-states-inauguration/65-a71e778b-177a-4c1f-b972-440c575f3e87)
are bragging that they will be prepared and enthusiastic about using
lethal force if any protestors turn up that day. Pelosi has been trying
to get the Army to remove Trump from office. She apparently thinks he
could launch a nuclear attack. We have come a long way from the America
where citizens were expected to petition their government for the
redress of grievances.

What we are seeing is the reaction of people who are no longer engaged
in normal life, but instead are playing the game of life. They are
immersed in a live action role playing game operated by juvenile
narcissists. The ruling class gets to imagine themselves as world
historical figures and every event puts the world on a knife edge. Their
actions will determine the outcome. The entire ruling class is swept up
in these false dramas that they get to play, while the rest of the
country suffers.

Another clue is how they echo one another in the use of dramatic
language to describe mundane events. One uses some over-the-top language
then the rest of them are repeating it, maybe adding on some more
dramatic language. The “protest” went from “riot” to “insurrection” to
“horrendous insurrection” in a few cycles. They are competing with one
another to show their loyalty to the group. What matters to them in this
game is the opinion of the people in the game, not the rest of us.

America has reached a point where the ruling class and its various
support structures is no longer connected to the people over whom it
rules. They are inside Versailles or the Winter Palace, imagining what
is happening outside. Meanwhile, outside, the world is nothing like the
rulers imagine. The people outside look at the palaces and try to
understand what is happening inside, based on the noises and behavior
they see from the organs of the state.

That really is the root of their anger. The outside broke though the
wall and gently reminded them that life is not a game and they are not
great men. In the game they are always the winners, but in real life
they are judged by their actions. It may take a while, but they will be
held accountable. This is what angers them. They hate this reality,
which is why they cling to the alternative reality of their fantasy, but
reality does not go away when you stop believing it.
