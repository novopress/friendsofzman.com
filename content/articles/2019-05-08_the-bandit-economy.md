There is an old parable about business ethics, where a young ambitious
man is hired to run a pickle factory. Being ambitious, he comes up with
a brilliant idea to increase productivity. He reduces the number of
pickles in each jar by one. The result is the cost per jar falls and the
number of jars produced goes up. His bosses are suitably impressed and
he is quickly promoted. The firm hires another young hotshot to take his
place, he quickly figures out the scheme and repeats the process.

The lesson of the story is that such an approach is not really about
increasing efficiency or cutting costs. It is about fraud and the limits
of fraud. If this process is carried out a few more times, customers
will notice that the jars have a lot less product. Taken to its logic
end, the company will eventually be sending empty jars to the market. Of
course, once the public catches onto the fraud, the good name of the
company is ruined and all of those savings they gained on the front end
are lost on the back end, plus interest.

It is a useful parable when trying to understand what has happened to
America over the last three decades. Free of the threat of nuclear
annihilation, the ruling class has abandoned ethics and morality. One
result is we live in a bandit economy, where things like

rather than exceptions. <a

Hedge details how the gas you put in your car has been systematically
watered down over the last quarter century, coincidentally starting at
the end of the Cold War.

Of course, a trip through the supermarket will find plenty of examples
of this phenomenon, some of which border on the absurd. The classic pint
of ice cream is now fourteen ounces and shrinking. It won’t be long
before they will quietly change the definition of quarter to be 2.5
pints. Only conspiracy theorists will notice the change. It used to be
that a pint was a pound the world around, but you can’t even
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgUJqkQfw_w"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">buy a pint of beer</a> without
a heroic capitalist pulling shenanigans on you. It’s becoming a game
with them.

The libertarian line about the market simply being a place where buyers
meets sellers sounds good in the hothouse, but in the real world, left
unattended, it becomes a grifters alley, where the honest are preyed
upon by the unscrupulous. Just as there is never a cop around when you
need one, there is no longer anyone policing the practices of our
capitalist overlords. If you want to know why people at the end of the
Industrial Revolution were open to the call of communism, stand in the
chip aisle of your market.

If you are the sort who likes a sandwich and some chips for his lunch,
the one thing you can’t help but notice is the bags of chips have grown
larger and more expensive. What used to be fifty cents is now a
buck-fifty. The bag is also twice the old size, but inside are fewer
chips than in the past. It’s already reached the point where the bag is
80% air and 20% product. If this continues on much longer, the lunch
time snack will be a dirigible sent to your office containing one chip.
That will be your drone delivery.

What the West is experiencing is something people figured out at the end
of the industrial revolution. That is, market capitalism is great,
except for the market capitalists. Left unsupervised, they quickly turn
into bandits in business attire, coming up with clever ways to rob the
public. Another feature of this age is the declining number of
independent suppliers. It turns out that a feature of unrestrained
market capitalism is the strangling of the market by a handful of
powerful suppliers, who exercise hegemonic power.

Of course, what is happening here, in a million little daily
transactions, is the monetization of public trust. The office workers
grabbing lunch trusted that the participants at their local deli were
playing fair. Meanwhile, those clever MBA-toting business men and their
brilliant ideas about removing just one more pickle from the jar, are
exploiting this trust and skimming a few more pennies from the unwitting
customer. This sort of practice is modern coin-clipping, which used to
be a capital offense.

At some point, when the rubes notice their sandwich can fit in the palm
of their hand and the bag of chips is the size of a hot-air balloon,
they lose their naiveté and privately realize they are being scammed. We
live in a cynical age, because privately, people are coming to believe
nothing is on the level and no grift is too small. That has the effect
of codifying deceit as a feature of the market and of society. We are
rapidly reaching a point where only a sucker trusts anyone other than
his friends and family.

This is why unfettered market capitalism is a cancer on society. It
turns morality on its head, justifying the unwillingness of the elite to
enforce public morality. It’s why your kid’s phone is full of hardcore
pornography. The market has spoken and you’re not against the market,
are you? Eventually, there is the “A-HA!” moment, when people discover
that their private loathing of the daily grift is shared by a large
portion of the population. The preference cascade sets the world on fire
and morality returns with a vengeance.
