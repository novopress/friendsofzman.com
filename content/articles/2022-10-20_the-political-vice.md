The British oddsmakers are not giving new prime minister Liz Truss much
of a chance to survive the year, putting the odds at 1-in-8. They are <a
href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/liz-truss-odds-front-runners-093703388.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">posting wagers</a> on her probable
replacement, which is a good sign they are confident they will have
plenty of action in the near term. You can wager on just about anything
in Britain but the point of posting odds is to attract action. If the
oddsmakers are posting odds on the next prime minister it means there is
a demand for it.

From an American perspective it is a bit amusing because of the
over-the-top way in which the media talks about these things. It is like
how British sports announcers turn a mundane sport like soccer into life
and death drama. Every player heroically passes the ball to some other
hero, who courageously passes it back. They are doing the same thing
with the political squabbles within the Tory party. They are carrying on
as if the island will flip over if they pick the wrong person.

The British are in political crisis because the people who actually run
the country never forgave Boris Johnson for supporting Brexit. The fact
is, the elites in Britain all wanted to be fully integrated into Europe.
They loathed the very idea of Brexit and detested the people who
supported it, which is the majority of the people. Just as everywhere
else, British elites, and those who think they are elites, define
themselves by the degree to which they hate the average subject.

The elites shoved old Boris over the side without thinking much about
who would replace him because of another quirk of modern Western elites.
They never think more than once move ahead when on the attack. When
scheming to line their own pockets, they are masters of eight
dimensional chess. When they get their feelings hurt, they tend to
blindly and maliciously strike out while howling in pain. They never
think about what happens after they get their revenge.

This is what is happening in Britain. They got revenge on old Boris, but
then they had no suitable replacement, so they were stuck with Liz
Truss. She is a simpleton, so this has quickly blown up on them. Now
they have to find a way to push her over the edge and find a different
empty suit to play the role of PM. The odds are the next person will be
terrible and this will force new elections. The other party will be
declared the winner and then the drama comes to an end.

The only reason this is interesting is that it will be a story we see
all over the West in the coming months, even in America. The midterms
are shaping up to be a disaster for the Democrats, so they will be
forced to address their Joe Biden problem. He is not going to go
quietly, because his handlers need him to stay. Joe Biden is a shuffling
husk, but the people holding important jobs in the administration need
him in the job so they can hold onto those important jobs. Dementia Joe
is useful.

Regardless, the people who actually run Washington will conclude that
they have a Joe Biden problem after the election. The trouble is the
next in line makes Liz Truss sound like Cicero, so pushing Biden over
the edge will just create new problems, but wounded animals do not think
that far ahead. We could very well see a replay in Washington of what is
happening in London. Biden is forced out for health reasons, then Harris
is forced out because everyone remembers that she is an idiot.

Of course, as the political turmoil in the West heats up over the next
year, the popular explanation will be that it is due to bad economics.
Inflation, shortages, recession and energy prices will get the blame.
You see this happening in Britain where inflation is getting blamed for
the crisis. It is complete nonsense. The Bank of England is undermining
the Tory government, not popular unrest. The Tories have no reason to
care about public opinion. They do care about elite opinion.

That is the real source of the crisis that is slowly spreading in the
West. In theory, government exists to exercise the will of the people.
The “general will” is defined though the democratic process. The parties
compete for support by offering up policies to address the issues the
voters think are important. The Tories are in power because they
supported Brexit and they implied they would do something about the
problems that naturally stem from post-national cosmopolitan globalism.

There was never any chance of this happening because the people who
actually run Britain never wanted those things. Those people are not
subject to elections and have no concern for public opinion. That is the
cause of the crisis. The political process and its results lie between
public opinion and elite opinion. The two sides are natural opposites
that operate like the jaws of a vice. As they close, the political
process is squeezed until it eventually bursts.

The fact is the West has reached a point where we cannot have both an
avaricious ruling elite and a prosperous middleclass. Either the elites
are brought to heel and are subject to the political process or the
middleclass collapses. The new world order is an effort to consolidate
power and impoverish the population. Populism and various forms of
nationalism are middleclass efforts to fight back against elites. The
West is now entering the survival stage of liberal democracy.

It is tempting to think that numbers matter and the people will
eventually win out and bring their elites under control. Covid should
disabuse anyone of that notion, as it is clear that most people would
rather die than speak out against the most humiliating abuses of the
elites. If you can make people wear their underwear around their heads,
you can make them do anything. Of course, an elite willing to mutilate
children is never going to be susceptible to appeals to their humanity.

On the other hand, no one was really at risk during Covid. People got
sick but people always get stick from something. Covid policies did not
put the general wellbeing in danger, at least not right away. When
people are worried about paying their rent or keeping the doors of their
business open, they stop worrying so much about offending the
sensibilities of rich people. Western people seem to accept no limits on
their humiliation, but maybe there is a limit.

Regardless, the West is clearly entering a crisis phase. Unlike past
crises in Greece, Spain or Italy, this one is occurring in the heart of
the West. People expect political turmoil in Italy, but not in Britain.
People expect the Spanish economy to be on the edge of the abyss, but
not the German economy. Washington is supposed to be the same regardless
of the party in power. This crisis is in the core of what made the
post-Cold War order possible. Soon, all of it will be up for debate.
