The reason why publications like National Lampoon and The Onion lost
their audience is daily life has become so ridiculous there’s no need to
lampoon it. Post-modern means, among other things, farcical.

*Georgetown University (GU) student who says he was mugged at gunpoint
says he “can hardly blame” his assailants.*

*Senior Oliver Friedfeld and his roommate were held at gunpoint and
mugged recently. However, the GU student isn’t upset. In fact he says he
“can hardly blame \[his muggers\].”*

*“Not once did I consider our attackers to be ‘bad people.’ I trust that
they weren’t trying to hurt me. In fact, if they knew me, I bet they’d
think I was okay,” wrote Friedfeld in an editorial featured in
<a href="http://www.thehoya.com/i-was-mugged-and-i-understand-why/"
rel="noopener" target="_new">The Hoya</a>, the university’s newspaper.
“The fact that these two kids, who appeared younger than I, have even
had to entertain these questions suggests their universes are light
years away from mine.”*

*Friedfeld claims it is the pronounced inequality gap in Washington,
D.C. that has fueled these types of crimes. He also says that as a
middle-class man, he does not have the right to judge his muggers.*

*“Who am I to stand from my perch of privilege, surrounded by
million-dollar homes and paying for a $60,000 education, to condemn
these young men as ‘thugs?’” asks Friedfeld. “It’s precisely this kind
of ‘otherization’ that fuels the problem.”*

*Police also aren’t the solution to the problem, Friedfeld argues.*

*“If we ever want opportunistic crime to end, we should look at
ourselves first. Simply amplifying police presence will not solve the
issue. Police protect us by keeping those ‘bad people’ out of our
neighborhood, and I’m grateful for it. And yet, I realize it’s
self-serving and doesn’t actually fix anything.”*

*Friedfeld suggests that the “privileged” adapt to normalized crime,
until the wrongs of the past are righted.*

*“The millennial generation is taking over the reins of the world, and
thus we are presented with a wonderful opportunity to right some of the
wrongs of the past,” writes Friedfeld. “Until we do so, we should get
comfortable with sporadic muggings and break-ins. I can hardly blame
them. The cards are all in our hands, and we’re not playing them.”*

*Friedfeld did not respond to Campus Reform’s request for comment in
time for publishing.*

This is common at our elite colleges and universities. Some time ago I
was visiting with a friend who was at Yale Divinity. In the grad school
bar we took in the scene and too many beers. What stood out was just how
socially awkward and submissive the men were compared to what one would
expect in a normal college setting. My friend said it was worse with the
graduates than the undergrads, but he was probably splitting hairs. He
called them a generation of suckups, which looked about right.

I can’t help but think it would have been better for all concerned if
the robbers had pulled the trigger on poor Oliver.
