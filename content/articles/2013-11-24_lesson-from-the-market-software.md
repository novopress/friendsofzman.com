I go to an upscale grocery store that is like Whole Foods, but without
the preachy liberal nonsense. They sell all the fashionable stuff and
they make sure to create an atmosphere that flatters their clientele. It
has a coffee shop and bakery, so shoppers can have a latte and a muffin
while they browse the organic food items. Of course, everyone uses the
silly canvas sacks that are supposed to be good for the earth. It’s all
pretentious and silly, but unlike Whole Foods, the prices are great so i
tolerate the other stuff.

Anyway, I was at the checkout and I noticed they still use a character
based computer software. Judging from the interface, I’m going to say it
is written in COBOL. You can sort of tell by the blue screen with red
highlights. It could be some form of business basic or maybe even
Clipper/Foxpro. Regardless, it is old stuff, probably written for them
two decades ago. They have scanners and scales, but that’s not
revolutionary. Integration to these items was done long before the
graphical user interface.

Checkout is fast and efficient. The clerks never struggle to price an
item or look up some obscure code for a weird item. For the grocery
chain owners, the point-of-sale system is perfectly adequate and they
obviously see no reason to “modernize it.” From their perspective, this
tools does the job that needs doing, so there is no reason to replace
with a new tool. In the grocery business, margins are small, so anywhere
they can reduce costs, they will, even if it means using a twenty year
old software system.

I know of at least a dozen goodly sized companies that use legacy system
for their business. In one case, they use a system written by a firm
long defunct in a language long abandoned. The other use systems that
are a decade or more out of date and no longer supported by the
developer. I know of a large importer using character based software
written in the 80’s. Most banks in this country rely on software written
in the 1970’s, patched up over the last few decades. There’s lots of old
code out there.

The point here is that good enough is good enough. As much as we think
technology is a constant driver of innovation and change, it does run
its course. The lesson from the market is that we may have picked all of
the low hanging fruit from the computer revolution. While automation
will continue, it will be much slower than the futurist would like us to
believe. That growing pile of legacy code that is out there in the world
will only make the process slower. We are quickly reaching the point of
diminishing returns.
