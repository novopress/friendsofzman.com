One of the problems the world faces is that the dominant power on the
planet has entered a period of incoherence. Joe Biden has come to
symbolize the country he allegedly leads in that he is old, frail and
not always understandable. This is how much of the world now sees the
United States. What they see from Washington are people either trapped
in a bygone era or divorced from present reality. It is as if the last
several decades never happened.

You see this in this Financial Times
<a href="https://archive.is/pL6QD" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">post</a> about what foreign policy could be like under a
second Trump presidency. Keep in mind that the Financial Times is often
used by the intelligence community to plant stories it wants to launder.
The audience is not just the English-speaking world, but also Europe.
The people quoted are all said to be associates of the Trump team. Their
views may or may not reflect the thinking of Trump’s inner circle.

That aside, the first thing to note is that there is no acknowledgement
of present reality in the story. For example, Congressman Michael Waltz
is quoted often about how to resolve the Ukraine war. He says, “Trump
could threaten to crash Russia’s economy by lowering the price of oil
and gas.” According to Waltz, this will force the Russians to beg for
peace negotiations. This policy makes sense if it is 1985 and Russia is
still the Soviet Union with a brittle command economy.

For starters, the president cannot willy-nilly change oil prices. No
amount of American production can drive down prices to a level where it
would have an impact on the Russian economy. The “break even” point of
Russian crude is well below that of the cheapest American production.
Then you have the fact that it will take a decade to bring American
crude production to the levels needed to crash prices. There is also the
fact that Biden emptied the strategic oil reserve.

In other words, the big idea from the foreign policy experts is
something they read about from the Reagan years that has no chance of
working now. It is as if they are unaware of the sanctions war they
launched two years ago that not only failed to crater the Russian
economy but boomeranged back on them. The German economy is in in free
fall because they no longer have access to cheap Russian gas. Meanwhile,
the Russian economy is booming.

Of course, there is the fact that these people can only think in terms
of threats when it comes to dealing with the rest of the world.
Congressman Michael Waltz is a neocon sock puppet who was an early <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">cheerleader</a> for Project Ukraine. He
was also wrong about every aspect of it. In any other profession, being
as wrong as Mike Waltz would be disqualifying, but here he is being
quoted as an authority on Russia. This is what happens when there are no
consequences to failure.

Elsewhere in the article, they quote Fred Fleitz, a former John Bolton
staffer and current foreign policy adviser at the America First Policy
Institute, which <a href="https://archive.is/w84wP" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">promotes</a> itself as helping shape Trump policy. With
regards to Iran, Fleitz argues “The objective should be to bankrupt Iran
again and to reinstitute maximum pressure.” Again? Has he not noticed
that Iran survived sanctions for three decades? Is he not aware that
Iran now has the support of China and Russia?

With regards to settling the war in the Ukraine, Fleitz says, “We freeze
the conflict, Ukraine does not cede any territory, they don’t give up
their territorial claims, and we have negotiations with the
understanding there probably won’t be a final agreement until Putin
leaves the stage.” Unlike Waltz, Fleitz has no clue as to why the
Russians would entertain such a silly offer. Note that this idea was
first floated by the neocons when the Ukrainian counter-offensive
failed.

The jaw droppingly ignorant part of that post is the use of the term
“Minsk-3” to describe the Trump strategy. The Russians correctly view
the Minsk agreements as a Western ploy to buy time to arm Ukraine. The
reason they think this is Angela Merkel said this in an interview last
year. Naming the Trump strategy after two prior efforts to trick the
Russians is just a way to make sure there can be no negotiations between
the Trump people and the Russians.

This is probably why this story was planted in the Financial Times. The
hope is to poison the well, so to speak, for the next administration
with regards to negotiating with the Russians. They may not be able to
control what Trump does, but they can give the Russians many reasons to
not trust any overtures. After all, Trump will be gone in four years, so
if they can freeze the Russia situation, they have a chance to get back
in power and resume their efforts to start a war with Russia.

What becomes clear in that Financial Times story is that the American
foreign policy establishment does not have a clue as to how to address
the many problems the next president will face. The main reason for
their incoherence is they seem to be unaware that these problems were
caused by them. Compounding it is the toxic ideology of neoconservatism
that has poisoned the foreign policy community. It is a cancer in the
bowels of America’s most important institution.

It is what makes prospects for a sober minded and realistic approach to
foreign policy under Trump unlikely. Trump’s instincts are good, as are
those with many of the people around him, including JD Vance, but he
will inherit a foreign policy establishment that is both stuck in the
past and corrupted by a worldview that is inconsistent with the world as
it is today and with the needs of the country. Fixing this problem
without the use of extrajudicial means may not be possible.
