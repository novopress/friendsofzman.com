When it comes time to write the obituary for Western civilization, the
focus will not be on the forces of destruction, but the forces of
distraction. These are the people who peddle utopian alternatives to the
present, thus preventing a real opposition forming up to defend the West
from its attackers. The West is not being destroyed by malevolent forces
like Wokism, antiwhite radicalism and the concentration of wealth in
alien hands, but by the forces preventing an organized resistance.

One of the primary examples of this is libertarianism. The real trick of
this evil ideology is that it convinces the victim that he is responding
with pure reason to the irrationalism of the rats gnawing away at
civilization. In reality he is indulging in fantasy, every bit as
ridiculous as left-wing utopianism. The difference is that Marx imagined
a world where man was freed from his nature through cooperation, while
Murray Rothbard dreamed of you being free from your community.

Libertarianism convinces the victim that cooperation is evil, so he not
only eschews any sort of organized resistance, but he also works to
prevent it. It is this last bit that allowed it to infiltrate
conservatism and turn it into a cat’s paw. Twentieth century
conservatism became the great defender of Progressive dominance,
undermining any resistance in the name of individual liberty. The result
is that otherwise good people volunteer to hang alone rather than hang
together.

The true nature of the cult of libertarianism is clear in this <a
href="https://mises.org/wire/thomas-piketty-wants-bring-back-communism-guise-democratic-socialism"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">review</a> of the most recent Thomas
Piketty book, *A Brief History of Equality*. The author of the review
does not beat around the bush attacking Piketty’s ideas. Instead, he
warns that it could persuade people to organize against the forces
destroying their society. In other words, the crime here is not in being
wrong about economics. The crime is in being wrong about politics by
advocating against the status quo.

As is custom when critiquing libertarianism, it needs to be pointed out
that the author’s revealed preference is for something other than
libertarianism. He has steadfastly avoided the dreaded private sector,
choosing a
<a href="https://mises.org/profile/mark-thornton" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">life</a> in government, the academy and think tanks. One
of things you will never find in the dreaded private sector is a genuine
libertarian, because people who work understand that society is not
possible without organization and someone enforcing the rules.

Putting that aside, the absurdity of libertarianism is that it starts by
agreeing with Marx on human organization. Marx believed that what
defined the human condition and drove the flow of history was economic
relations. The human condition is defined by man’s economic relations
with other men. This is not only the starting point for both Marxism and
libertarianism, but the end point as well. Both seek the perfection of
human relations through economics.

Of course, Marx was wrong about the nature of man. Humans are not
defined by their economic relationships with other men. The glue that
holds people together is blood, their shared ancestry. The things that
define a people are not the product of economic relations but the
product of their shared struggle as a people. Culture is the answer to
the central question of human organization. “Who are we?” is answered by
the traditions, customs and history of the people.

Put another way, culture is the shared labor of the people. It is not
just the product of their current labor. Culture is the preservation and
improvement of their ancestor’s labor in order top pass it to the next
generation. Culture is the shared accretive product of generations of
people. That is what defines a people and the individual, not the
trading of goods between people. The Marxist and libertarians strip man
of his humanity by reducing him to his transactions.

The Marxists and libertarians share something else. Both are a response
to the individualism of John Locke. If God holds dominion over the world
because he created it, and man was made in God’s image, then it
naturally flows that man holds dominion over that which he created. You
own you and everything you make because who you are is the product of
your labor. This is the bedrock of Western liberalism. We are naturally
free because we own ourselves.

Marx saw capitalist economic relations as the source of exploitation,
which he defined as men compelled to labor for others. Contrary to
popular legend, Marx was not opposed to capitalism, a term he
popularized. He saw capitalism as a necessary transition phase to
socialism. Eventually, the number of people controlling capital, thus
compelling labor, would shrink to the point where people would overthrow
them and restore their rights to their own labor.

Libertarianism makes a similar argument. Instead of the holders of
capital compelling labor, it is the state. You will note they always
avoid discussing who actually owns the state, but instead focus on how
the state compels your labor. They tax your labor and force you to so
that which you otherwise not do. It is only when the state is eliminated
will you be free, because then you will once again own your labor. They
land in the same utopia as the Marxist, just by a different road.

It is not hard to see why libertarians despise culture as much as the
enemies of Western civilization despise it. Culture defines *who*
decides. The culture of a people defines who makes the final decisions.
The answer is always confined to people who are of the people. How those
people are selected and by what right they make their decisions on
behalf of the people is within that context. Both Marxists and
libertarians hate this idea and always oppose it.

This is the great trick of liberal utopianism. One side explicitly seeks
to obliterate natural human relations in order to reach the promised
land. The alleged opponent implicitly seeks to obliterate natural human
relations but claims to be a defense of those natural relations, which
they define as pretty much the same as their opponent’s vision of man in
his blessed utopia. In both cases, the goal is a world of pure
self-ownership in which man has no debt to anyone but himself.

Whenever the final accounting of Western civilization is done,
libertarianism will go down as the greatest hoax in human history. In
the name of individual liberty, it commands the followers to build the
gas chambers used by their alleged opponents to snuff out the defenders
of Western culture. Without out that culture, what is left is a
deracinated mass of individuals enslaved to the great ideological state,
drugged by cheap consumer goods to avoid contemplating the banality of
life.
