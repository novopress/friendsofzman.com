This week is a show about women. No, it is not just me mocking
feminists, but there is some of that. I think our side does not always
talk about the proper role of women, mostly because the people involved
in dissident politics are men. <span style="line-height: 1.625;">That
and the feminist loons dominate the issue, so the natural tendency is to
react to their latest lunacy. It is a topic our side should talk about
in a more constructive way, so I thought I’d try a little bit of that
this week. At the same time, I wanted to keep it light, so I have some
feminist bashing too.</span>

After wrapping this episode up, it occurred to me that there are no
alt-right women outside of the eye candy who do YouTube videos. Let’s
face it, their popularity is superficial. No one will be asking me about
<a href="http://www.irreplaceablebook.com/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Tara McCarthy’s thoughts</a> on the current crisis.
That’s no knock on these women. I’m just pointing out that the women
involved in dissident politics are not engaging at an intellectual
level. On the other hand, the more thoughtful women may be confined to
the trad-mom world, which I don’t follow, so who know.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I’m now on
Spotify, so the millennials can tune in when not sobbing over white
privilege and toxic masculinity.
