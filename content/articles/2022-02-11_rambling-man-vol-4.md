This week I have been pressed for time, so the shows I have in the
planning stages had to be shelved for something that fit the schedule.
Since the schedule has little free time right now, that meant I turned
on the mic and spoke for an hour off the top of my head about whatever
was on my mind. I did no editing and I stopped only once or twice for a
drink as I was recording, so it is pretty much a first draft. All things
considered it is not the worst noise you will hear this week.

Upon reflection, I probably have more to say about the trucker protest
in Canada than I said in the show. One thing that comes to mind as I
type this is that it reveals just how controlled the mass media is now.
They have been told to ignore it other than some approved narratives and
that is what they have done. Look at the Canadian media and there is
zero sympathetic coverage of the protestors. They are making no effort
to meet with these people and give them a hearing.

The American media has brought down the cone of silence. Drudge has a
government issued warning to Canada at the top. The New York Times and
Washington Post are busy peddling their latest Russia fantasies. Soviet
media was more informative that the American media is now. If you want
to know anything about anything you have to dig around in Substack and
independent sites. The American media is now a blanket of darkness
thrown over the public square.

The other thing that comes to mind is how blatant the authoritarianism
is now. I see the Canadian dictator just ordered the funds for the
truckers frozen. He just made up some new rule apparently or his
handlers did. Trudeau is most likely illiterate, so he has to rely on
others to do these things. The US government is flying surveillance
aircraft over the protest to intercept communications. They will then
“share” this intel with their “partners” in the Canadian secret police.

This is the new game now. We saw this with Trump. The CIA asked
Australia and Britain to spy on the Trump campaign. That got around the
rule against the CIA spying on Americans and gave the FBI an excuse to
do their own spying. Five years ago, they made up a phony story as
cover, but now it is out in the open. We live in a country that has
secret police that spy on people with impunity. America is becoming East
Germany with better consumer goods.

That last bit is always the undoing of authoritarians. You can run a
police state or you can have a happy productive society that has nice
things. With posted inflation approaching double digits and real
inflation much higher, the economic reckoning is quickly approaching.
There is no easy way to tame inflation. It always means a recession and
usually an ugly one. People are unhappy now. Imagine where things are
when the economy is in the dumper.
