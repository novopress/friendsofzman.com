Lost in all the howling about DOGE, the rogue judges and the Ukraine
happenings is the Trump economic policy that is slowly coming into
focus. One of the reasons the administration pushed for the continuing
resolution was that they needed time to put together budgets and
spending priorities based on the cuts they are now making across all
agencies of the government.

It is why they were so mad about the grandstanding of Thomas Massie. He
is clearly someone who does not understand what they are doing and too
addled by the brain-rot of libertarianism to ever understand it. He
wanted to waste time and political capital on a pointless fight over
pennies. The administration has bigger plans for reorganizing the
government that needs time to develop.

The new economic model will be based on cheap energy, cheap money, low
taxes on labor, limited regulation, and tariffs on imports. You can hear
all of these when Trump seems to speak off the cuff. His plan to
eliminate taxes for those earning under $150,000 per year is a good
example. That is not just a tax cut for the wage earner, but also a tax
cut for the employer.

The point is to make labor relatively cheaper for domestic employers,
while using tariffs to make cheap foreign labor relatively more
expensive. This is not a lot different from what Reagan tried to do in
the 1980’s with Japan. Instead of being limited to trade issues with
specific countries, it is to be the general policy. The goal is to boost
domestic production in order to lower imports.

That is the show this week. The first part is a summary of the current
economic model which no one discusses anymore. Back when it was coming
into focus, people debated it and those opposed turned out to be right.
The second part is about the schemes to unwind the old model and create
a new one. Trumponomics is Abenomics but for a continent sized country
with the global reserve currency.
