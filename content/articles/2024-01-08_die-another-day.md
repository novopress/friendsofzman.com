**Note:** There was no Sunday podcast this week. I got back from the new
house and was simply too tired to do it. I may put the Sunday show on
ice until I get the house finished, which means doing something else in
its place. Behind the green door, there were two written items this
week. A post about my trip to the witchdoctor and post about the
aesthetics of modern cars. Subscribe

It would take a heart of stone not to laugh at the massive food fight
that erupted among the worst people over how the allegedly best people
cheat like crazy. Claudine Gay, the former president of Harvard, was
supposed to be a proof of concept for the egalitarian blank slate
religion of the Cloud People. In reality she was as synthetic as their
empathy for people of color. Claudine Gay was a modern lawn jockey.
Instead of standing on their lawn with a lantern, she held up her
diplomas.

Then we have Bill Ackman, the billionaire hedge fund guy who started
this when Gay made unpleasant noises about Israel. He first threatened
to withdraw funding and when that did not work, he went after her
credentials. In a world of credentialism this was a declaration of war
on the system. Soon the internet dug into Gay’s background and found
examples of alleged plagiarism. Harvard then demoted her to being a
million dollar a year political science instructor.

In response, MIT decided to get into the fight, and they leaked <a
href="https://www.businessinsider.com/neri-oxman-plagiarize-wikipedia-mit-dissertation-2024-1"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">dirt</a> to Business Insider about
Ackman’s wife, who supposedly had a cut and paste problem too. It is
ironic that people who are immune to the charge of hypocrisy thought
they could use the charge of hypocrisy against people famously immune
from the charge of hypocrisy. It is an example of how the hive mind
operates. Once Ackman was declared outside the hive, he was no different
from Trump or Hitler to the hive.

For his part, Ackman has declared a jihad against MIT. He is asking for
volunteers to scan the academic work of everyone at MIT. He has also
offered to fund the use of technology to expedite the process.
Interestingly, the MIT president said all the same things as the Harvard
and Penn presidents about Israel, but she has been immune from criticism
to this point. Perhaps she thought the force field was not enough to
protect her, so she launched this preemptive strike.

Again, it is hard not to enjoy this poo-flinging contest, but it
obscures a reality at the heart of the whole thing. That is the logic of
the egalitarian religion must lead them to these self-destructive ends.
The reason for that is there is no way to reach the stated goals of this
new religion without dismantling the standards and practices of the
Western society that made the modern university possible. In other
words, to dismantle whiteness they must dispense with the rules of
whiteness.

The only reason Claudine Gay can exist is if the rules of the academy
are changed to make it possible for her to exist. All along the way her
mostly white advisors cut corners for her so she could move along
through the system. They do this because it was the path of least
resistance, but also for self-interest. They could subtly mention how
they were once the advisor of this shining example of the new religion.
This is social capital an academic can use for status seeking.

Systemic rule breaking is not confined to the grievance studies areas.
The need to acquire totems of the new religion is everywhere on campus.
The chemistry department at Rice University, for example, spends scarce
resources on thirty different diversity and inclusion
<a href="https://chemistry.rice.edu/diversity-and-inclusion"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">programs</a>. The department now offers a
for-credit course in <a
href="https://courses.rice.edu/courses/courses/!SWKSCAT.cat?p_action=COURSE&amp;p_term=202420&amp;p_crn=25669"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Afrochemistry</a>, which is taught by
this <a href="https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/brooke-johnson"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">woman</a>. She will no doubt be lifted up
on the shoulders of academics and socially promoted into a leadership
role.

This all sounds fine except that when you populate your new system with
people who are both incompetent and entitled, the results of that system
will reflect this. The long running discussion about the decline of
elite universities is centered around the fact the graduates are often
astoundingly incompetent. The truth is, they may be incompetent at
traditional things, but they are stars at the rules of the new system.
The products of dismantling whiteness are good at dismantling whiteness.

The reason we have a crisis of competence in America is the managerial
system is slowly being taken over by people who are only good at gaming
the system to produce diverse, equitable and inclusive results. The
managerial system is slowly being bent to the goal of denying its own
existence. No one would dare hire Brooke Johnson to do chemistry, but
she plays a role in who gets hired to do chemistry. Get enough Brooke
Johnsons and Claudine Gays and the system begins to fail.

All of this was inevitable as soon as the moralizers of the
mid-twentieth century declared a fatwa against nature. Once it was
immoral to notice natural inequality and the fixed nature of people, the
old system was doomed. The only permissible explanation for the
persistent inequality was to blame the system and that meant destroying
the system was the only moral path forward. The social promotion system
is about maintaining the myth of egalitarianism.

That also means there is no way out for these elite colleges. Bill
Ackman can expose all of them as plagiarists, cheats, and fools, but
nothing will change because nothing can change as long as the core
tenets of the faith remain. Unless Bill Ackman has a new religion for
these people to embrace, they will burn the whole system to the ground
before abandoning diversity, equity, and inclusion. This means the
collapse of the university system is inevitable.
