While on a walk, I was listening to Jared Taylor
<a href="https://www.amren.com/podcasts/2023/10/the-war-on-whites/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">interview</a> a fellow calling himself Ed
Brodow about his <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/WAR-WHITES-Hating-People-National/dp/B0C63VW28M/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3RVLHBS1XYW2Z&amp;keywords=ed+brodow&amp;qid=1692580300&amp;sprefix=ed+brodow%2Caps%2C96&amp;sr=8-1"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">book</a>, *The War on Whites: How Hating
White People Became the New National Sport. *Given the title and the
platform, I was expecting the author to have similar views on race as
other people in that scene. Instead, he sounded more like a civic
nationalist or a typical conservative.

It was a fascinating conversation as the author would layout a bunch of
facts you would get from the race realist camp, but then try to fit them
into the conventional moral framework with regards to race. At the same
time, Jared was trying to lead him back to the obvious conclusion of the
facts the man has in his book. It was an interesting back and forth that
is well worth a listen.

It was also a great example of of the power of moral authority. Jared
Taylor rejects the moral claims about race that come from the race
denialists, while the author of the book accepts most of those moral
claims. It was a clash of moral visions that highlights a central
problem with regards to race. One side has a different view of right and
wrong regard race than the other side of the conversation.

This is not unusual. When it comes to a wide range of issues, most
opinions are guided by a moral framework that few people consider.
Everyone accepts, for example, that racism is a universal moral concept.
Everyone knows it is wrong to notice race, unless you are of the elect
and you are noticing that someone not of the elect is noticing something
about race. Then and only then is noticing race okay.

The truth is, noticing race was normal until the middle of the last
century and the normative claims about racism we take for granted today
would have been unknowable to people a century ago. This new moral
framework, however, does not rest on a legitimate moral foundation. It
was conjured from the ether and great effort is made to conceal its lack
of moral authority.
