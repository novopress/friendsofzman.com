Big events reveal things that may have been in plain sight for a while,
but they remained hidden for cultural or political reasons. The mortgage
crisis of 2008 is a good example of something that was hidden in plain
sight. The sub-prime corruption should have been obvious, but few people
saw it. When the system started to lock up, everyone suddenly noticed
the massive corruption. The signs were there for a long time, but it was
the fear of collapse that forced everyone to face it.

We are seeing an example of this with the war in Ukraine. Europe has
been a land run by ridiculous people for a long time, but it was
concealed by tradition and the Global American Empire pretending that
European “leaders” are serious people. The war has revealed that Europe
is a farce. It is not a collection of countries operating in concert for
the common good. It is a collection of territories of the Global
American Empire run by provincial clodhoppers with no real power.

Baiting the Russians into war served no European interests. It is
obviously bad for the people of Europe. There is nothing to be gained
for them by this war. It is wrecking the economy and reducing the
standard of living. It is not good for European business, which now
finds itself uncompetitive due to the costs of war. Germany is now on a
short path to de-industrialization. Given that the German economy is the
heart of the European economy, this will harm all of Europe.

The war is proving disastrous for the political class as well. Unlike
the United States, there is no big sprawling military industrial complex
in these countries. They have some boutique industries, but nothing like
the American arms industry. That means there are not great profits to be
had, which can be used to bribe the political class. Instead, the
stockpiles of Europe are being stripped by NATO to supply Ukraine, while
EU politicians pretend to be leading the effort.

If the European political class existed as anything more than a carnival
act, they would have told Washington to pound sand and made a deal with
the Russians long before this war in Ukraine could get started. In
fairness, Angel Merkel pretended to be doing that in 2014, but that was
just a con run by Washington. She has since admitted that she was lying
to the Russians to buy time for Washington to arm and train the
Ukrainian military for a war with the Russians.

Merkel was the most important “leader’ in Europe and she was nothing
more than a toady for the Global American Empire. That right there
speaks to the impotence of the European political class. This is why the
Kremlin does not bother to take the calls of European “leaders” anymore.
What is the point? A state governor in America has more sovereign
authority that a European leader. If Ron DeSantis called Putin, Putin
would take the call because DeSantis has real power.

The fact is “Europe” is just an economic zone heading for the abyss
because the plans of Washington require it. American politicians are
happy to get those checks from the oil and gas industry, which is
getting fat selling LNG to Europe. The American war machine is happy to
use Ukraine as a testing ground. If the Europeans have to reduce their
lifestyle, well, that is tough luck for them. The people in charge have
bigger issues than the welfare of the territory called Europe.

The fact is, Europe is dead and it has been dead for a long time. None
of the EU states is a sovereign country. The national governments do not
control their currency, which is a prerequisite for sovereignty. Their
budgets must be approved by Brussels, which sets most regulatory policy
for the bloc. These “countries” no longer control their borders in any
meaningful way. The EU controls the flow of people by the farcical rules
set up to deal with refugees from the global south.

A country that does not control its money, its laws or its borders is
not a country, so it has no need for serious national leaders. This is
why the political class of Europe has become increasingly comical over
the last decades. It is the same reason that American mayors, especially
in small cities, tend to be eccentric. A mayor has limited powers and
mostly performs symbolic acts. That is the definition of a European
leader. They have no real power, but they need to perform for the
public.

It is not just the continent. Britain has become a floating carny act as
well. Does anyone know the name of the current Prime Minister? Would
anyone be shocked if the White House did not know his name? Why would
they? That role has been reduced to an administrative post. The proof of
that is Washington is <a
href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ec5c31bc-92ba-11ed-8b99-f233af7a7956"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">planning</a> to send Boris Johnson to
Ukraine to deliver the latest instructions. Maybe they think Boris is
still in charge or, most likely, they know who is *really* in charge.

The sad fact is the Global American Empire spent the last half century
turning Europe into a giant outdoor theme park. It draws in tourists to
gaze at its long lost glory and it soaks up American cultural items.
Walk through a mall in Europe and you hear hip-hop music and see NBA
jersey on display. The European culture that tourists want to see is
locked up in museums, while the real European culture is as vulgar and
degenerate as the rest of the Global American Empire.

In this excellent
[post](https://gilbertdoctorow.com/2023/01/02/wars-make-nations/) by
Gilbert Doctorow, he explains how this proxy war with the West is
redefining Russia as a nation. Wars often define countries. The two
industrial wars of the 20th century changed America from a republic to a
global empire. Wars can also destroy countries. This is what happened
with Europe. Those two wars plus the Cold War drained the vitality from
Europe, reducing it to an economic zone, a dependency of the Global
American Empire. That is obvious now.

The hope for Europe is that this reality is made so clear by
Washington’s war on Russia that the farce can no longer be maintained.
Perhaps some elements of the European political class grow tired of the
humiliations they must endure and seek to regain their nations from the
clutches of Washington. Perhaps the cost of war loosens the grip of
Washington on the empire. Otherwise, that grip will squeeze what little
life remains in Europe and the lights go out forever.
