**Note:** The Monday Takis <a
href="https://www.takimag.com/article/the-fight-for-civic-nationalism/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> is up. Not all that related to
this post, but not entirely unrelated either. I like the Taki post this
week. The Sunday
<a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/posts/469360" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">podcast</a> is up behind the green door for those on the
side of angels. I was on for two hours last night saying bad things
about lots of people. You can find the replay

------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the great innovations in American politics introduced by
libertarians is the ability to turn the sidelines into the moral high
ground. In order to avoid taking on the Left, especially with regards to
morality, libertarians became expert at finding a neutral position that
worked like a cloaking device. Because the libertarian position offered
no threat to the Left, the Left ignored it. This allowed libertarians to
pretend to oppose radicalism while never threatening it.

This cloaking strategy took the form of them finding some “principled
position” that was often so unrealistic that it did not bear
considering. A good example is the homosexual marriage debate. Normal
people understood that what the crazies were doing was attacking the
very concept of the family. The exclusivity of family offends the core
concepts of the open society. Reducing marriage to a handshake agreement
open to anyone eliminates its exclusivity.

Instead of confronting the reality of this, libertarians took the
position that the state should have no interest in marriage at all. In
other words, the libertarian answer to the assault on the institution of
marriage was to advocate the elimination of the legal concept of
marriage entirely. This allowed them to subtly agree with the Left while
claiming to stand on some abstract principle. The libertarian moral high
ground was just a way to stand on the sidelines and do nothing.

This habit of mind soon infected Conservative Inc. A strategy that
allowed them to tell well-meaning rich people that they are fighting the
good fight, while never upsetting their friends on the Left was manna
from heaven. One manifestation of the this is the “conservative case
for…” strategy where they find a way to make the left-wing position into
a right-wing principle. Another is the agree and amplify approach. The
Democrats are the real racists is the most popular example.

Over the weekend the so-called conservatives were trying to pair the
<a href="https://twitter.com/redsteeze/status/1461824481584812037"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Andrew Coffee</a> case with the Kyle
Rittenhouse case. Coffee is a drug dealer who was involved in a gun
fight with cops at his drug den. His girlfriend was killed in the gun
fight. The state charged him with her murder on the theory that he
initiated the gun battle, so he was culpable for her death. He was
acquitted on the grounds that he had a right to defend his drug den from
the cops and black lives matter.

Now, the Coffee case is interesting for a number of reasons and one can
argue that his acquittal was justified. It is in no way analogous to the
Rittenhouse case. Comparing the two is a way to defend some abstract
principle of self-defense while not taking on the reality of the
Rittenhouse case. It was a purely political prosecution. If he was black
the Left would have made him a hero. Because he was white and his
attackers were antiwhite, they wanted to murder him.

Another example of this is the CRT business. It is explicitly antiwhite
and the people pushing it are not afraid to make that point. The
response from so-called conservatives is to claim that it was an assault
on black people or Asians. They scoured the land for examples willing to
play along. Christopher Rufo, the guy turning the issue into a career,
went out of his way to beat back the antiwhite angle. The reason he
opposed calling it antiwhite is it offended the Left.

Conservatives have been hiding under their beds for the last five years
as the Left has run various antiwhite pogroms. First the excuse was
Donald Trump made them sad, so they had to stay in bed. Then they
not-so-subtly blamed the people who voted for him, those
insurrectionists white supremacists. Now that Biden is as popular as
rectal cancer, they feel the coast is clear so they can crawl out from
under the beds to pretend they are leading a political movement.

House mouse Rich Lowry has a <a
href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/11/woke-racialism-is-a-clear-and-present-danger-to-the-american-system/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> wagging his finger at “woke
culture” in which he, wait for it, says the Left are the real racists.
You see, the response to the antiwhite pogroms of the last half dozen
years is not a rigorous defense of white people, but rather a
declaration of race denialism as a conservative principle. Meeting the
Left head on would be wrong. Instead, they will find some comfy place on
the sidelines where they can smugly pretend they have the moral high
ground.

It is tempting to think this stuff is intentional, but guys like Rich
Lowry lack the intellectual agility to think this way. He is just an
obsequious dullard. Instead, the reason behind this approach is
instinct. To be a conservative in the modern sense of it is to assume
the Left is the moral superior and they are on the side of angels. This
is the starting assumption on the so-called Right. Therefore, to oppose
left-wing morality is to become the bad guy in the political drama.

Since the conservative ecosystem selects for the soft and the cowardly,
it is full of people unwilling to look their superiors in the eye. That
has been the great gift the libertarians have bestowed upon them. It was
the entry fee for libertarians to join the coalition of cowards knowns
as conservatism. Whatever the Left proposes, the Right will find some
morally ambiguous space from which they can pretend to be standing on
principle while offering no resistance.

While frustrating, events of the past few years have made this clear to
most people and this trick is losing its magic. The odious David French,
a man so soyish he makes Rich Lowry look butch, <a
href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/kyle-rittenhouse-right-self-defense-role-model/620715/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">condemning</a> Kyle Rittenhouse in a
far-left website is now met with howls of laughter. Current events are
providing much needed clarity. In this time for choosing, the cowards
who choose the sidelines can be condemned and ignored while the business
of beating back the darkness can begin.
