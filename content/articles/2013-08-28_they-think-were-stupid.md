Politics is mostly theater to keep anyone from noticing that the people
in charge are not the people you see on your televisions. It’s not the
tin-foil hat deep-state stuff, but the politicians all report to their
donors. Still, the reason the media exists is to put a professional
gloss on the whole thing. The people working for the New York Times are
supposed to be good at the propaganda stuff. Instead <a

You see? It’s not a normal system failure that happens every day. It was
a super-sophisticated crew of hackers who live in a war torn land
without running water and electricity. There’s no question that the
people charged with writing up this stuff probably believe it. They are
dumb and don’t know any better. The people running the company certainly
know better, but they go with it anyway because they think we’re dumb.

It is long past time to stop with the scary hacking stories. The reason
they got hacked, assuming it happened, is incompetence. A properly
designed and managed site like a news site should never get hacked. In
most cases, the site is not even hacked. The hosting service is what
goes down and that’s seldom a real hack. Usually it is either a stupid
IT guy leaving a door open or an old fashioned hardware failure. There’s
also the fact that the New York Times is not exactly a high value target

Of course, the point is to keep beating the war drums over Syria. The
same media that spent the entire Bush administration in hysterics of his
wars is now out promoting war in Syria. The reason is magic black guy.
War in Syria is even dumber than war with Iraq and that was pretty dumb.
At least there was some chance of finding a local strong man to take
over fro Saddam. Topple over Assad and it is chaos for a generation or
longer.
