One of the greatest tricks Americans have ever pulled is convincing
themselves and the world that we are not ideologues. At worst, we are
the defenders of Western liberalism, which is never described as an
ideology. Unlike communism or fascism, it is seen as a set of obvious
conclusions arrived at through reason. If anything, the American way is
considered a practical antidote to the problems of ideology.

This has always been nonsense, but we have believed it for so long that
no one thinks much about it anymore. The closest we get are critiques of
liberalism from neo-traditionalists, as if we still live in a liberal
age. In reality, America is an ideological state and has been for a long
time. The ideology has evolved to suit the times, but the core features
have remained unchanged since the 19th century.

This is one reason for the current crisis. The age of ideology is coming
to a close, but the United States, especially its ruling class, remains
trapped in the age of ideology—like a dinosaur stuck in a tar pit. While
other major powers think and talk in practical terms about practical
problems, the United States continues to think and talk in explicitly
moral terms about abstract concepts.

That is the show this week. It is an exploration of American ideology
and the factors that made it possible. This is a topic that could fill
up several more shows, so this episode is just a quick summary of the
material. I could easily do at least one show on how the two great
industrial wars warped the American perspective. The Cold War could be
at least one episode, probably two, so this is just a starting point.
