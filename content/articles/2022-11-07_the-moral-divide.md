**Note \#1:** I was on with Mike Ferris to have a causal chat about
current events and the midterm elections. You can listen <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>. The Monday
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/29647/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Taki post</a> is up and it is related to the topic of
the day. Sunday Thoughts is up behind the green door so if you do not
have a subscription, get one.

**Note \#2:** If you post a comment and it disappears or says something
about it being in moderation, do not keep hitting submit. Do not change
the wording thinking you will game the robots. Be patient. I check
moderation several times every hour so your post will appear shortly.
The best way to avoid moderation is to not link to video or images, as
they always get flagged and I rarely approve them.

Every human society has a set of rules that define the society and
answer the most fundamental question for any human society. You cannot
have a society without first answering the question, who are we? History
and biology do the heavy lifting for large human societies, while
smaller societies, like social clubs, will have some sort of founding
document to define the society. Of course, constitutions are not just
for small scale societies. Big countries have them too.

The United States has had at least three unifying concepts. Originally,
what held America together was a common religion. The founding
generation were English people who practiced a common form of
Christianity. Subsequently, the country was held together by republican
virtue. A civic religion based around the liberal principles in the Bill
of Rights. This was replaced in the 20th century with the melting pot
idea, where diverse people emerge from the crucible of liberty as one
people.

Throughout our history, in every framing of American unity, a set of
principles has defined the morality of American society. First and
foremost, Americans have the unfettered right to speak their minds, even
to those in positions of authority, without fear of retribution. Free
speech, the freedom of belief, the freedom to assemble and the freedom
to do all of these to petition the government for the redress of
grievances is the first principle of American morality.

There are other moral principles enshrined in the Bill of Rights. The
right of self-defense, even from the government, is in the Second
Amendment. The Fourth Amendments prevents the state from spying on
citizens. The Fifth Amendment prevents double jeopardy and compulsory
self-incrimination. The things we think of as our rights are enumerated
in the Bill of Right, but in practice these are the moral principles we
consider to be beyond questioning.

It is those rights in the First Amendment that are the most sacred to
Americans, as they are the cornerstone of American morality. The right
to believe what you want to believe, say those beliefs out loud and
organize fellow believers to promote your beliefs is the encapsulation
of the American identity. It is not just how Americans see themselves,
but how the rest of the world defines American identity. The rest of the
world may not like what we say, but they envy our right to say it.

This is what makes the assaults on Kanye West and Kyrie Irving
important. These two are not simply getting jeered by detractors. There
is a highly organized effort to destroy their lives and strip from them
their most basic right. In the case of Irving, he has been
[told](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nets-give-kyrie-irving-six-requirements-to-fulfill-before-he-can-return-to-team-per-report/)
that he must publicly condemn the movie he promoted and denounce
everyone involved in it. This is what the Red Guards did to their
victims. They were forced to publicly confess and wear dunce caps in
public.

There is also the race issue. Black people in America get a free pass on
speech, even when their speech offends common decency. Kanye West
promotes himself as a Christian, but he got rich in a business built on
peddling vulgarity, violence, drug taking and criminality. Everyone has
been forced to use euphemisms in order to discuss crime, because blacks
get special treatment. Here we are, however, with two famous black
people forced into a humiliation ritual.

What this suggests is the bigots opposed to this core moral tenet, the
right to speak freely and without fear of retribution, have removed
themselves from what we have always considered the fundamental morality
of America. Bigot is the correct word, as a bigot is someone obstinately
or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices and
intolerant of those outside their group. This is the factionalism that
the Founders warned was incompatible with a republic.

Kanye West and Kyrie Irving are ridiculous people whose heads are full
of nonsense, but these are the people who have always been the proof
case. In our society, we tolerate ridiculous people with nonsense in
their heads. To paraphrase Jefferson, we try to set them right to the
facts. If they remain unpersuaded, we persuade everyone else to ignore
them. From time to time, the ridiculous guy spouting nonsense turns out
to be right and we are all better for it.

That is unlikely to be the case here, but it is not the point. What this
incident reveals is that there is a moral divide. There is no middle
ground when it comes to these moral principles that define American
civilization. There is no ADL exemption to our moral code that permits
this. There is no moral scold clause that permits the SPLC to organize
an economic war on Elon Musk. These people have chosen to remove
themselves from our common morality.

The moral separation is at the very heart of American identity. The
Declaration of Independence is a moral document that spells out how the
colonies and Great Britain no longer shared the same moral space.
Because the colonies had evolved a new moral code that was different
from that of the mother country, it was necessary that the colonies
break free from the mother country. Two people who lack a common more
code must separate from one another.

What normal Americans now face is the dilemma imagined by Hans
Hermann-Hoppe when thinking through the challenges of a libertarian
society. Hoppe has tried to address a well known contradiction in
libertarian theory. How can a libertarian society deal with people who
embrace socialism or monarchism? If your principles prevent the use of
coercion, what do you do when members of a libertarian society embrace
something contrary to libertarianism?

The starting place of every human society is that set of moral
principles that answers the most fundament question for every human
society, who are we? What must be done when a segment of society decides
they are no longer us? This is what the bigots are presenting to the
rest of us. They refuse to uphold our morality, the thing that defines
us as a people, so they are in effect making war on us. How should we
defend ourselves from this assault on our very nature?
