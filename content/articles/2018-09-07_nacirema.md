Over the long holiday weekend, I had the misfortune of being in the
company of a classic ConservaCon type. The only thing he was missing was
the tricorn hat and over-sized copy of the Constitution. No matter what
the topic, he somehow circled back to some version of “we need to get
back to our constitutional principles.” It is the abracadabra phrase of
these people. If we just say it enough times, poof!, we’re in the 18th
century again, with better hygiene. It really is annoying, even if it is
understandable.

On the way home I started thinking about the rights that actually exist
in the Bill of Rights and how much of them we actually have now. I
though it might make a good topic for the podcast, so that’s what I’m
doing this week. It is one of those topics where after some thinking
about it, you end up sounding like a radical civil rights lawyer. Well,
like what radical civil rights lawyers used to sound like when we still
had something resembling a constitutional republic and stable
demographics. Funny how that worked out.

Something I did not discuss this week, but occurred to me while editing,
is that our side needs a William Kunstler. He was the old publicity
hound, who represented the radicals of the 60’s and 70’s. It was not so
much that he was a great attorney, but that he knew how to work the
press in favor of unpopular clients. Those old radicals knew how to
normalize the defense of villains, thus making them less villainous, but
also making it more difficult to railroad the inconvenient. He raised
the cost of what passed for virtue signaling.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I’m now on
Spotify, so the millennials can tune in when not sobbing over white
privilege and toxic masculinity.
