A feature of this age is that we are regularly presented with unusual
events and then presented with an official explanation that is stranger
than the event itself or given no explanation at all for what happened.
In fact, you could describe the Trump era as a series of unexplained
phenomena that either come with no official explanation or one so
ridiculous no one accepts it. Trump is like a modern-day wizard in that
his mere existence creates unexplainable happenings.

In this age of mass communications, we are more likely to experience
rare events, because those rare events get blasted around the internet
by people looking to profit from them, so that is part of it. On the
other hand, the same technology regularizes rarity, so rare events
should be less frequent. Just as soon as people start to notice some bit
of weirdness, the authorities can flood the information space with a
plausible explanation, so it is not just a feature of mass media.

For example, this summer a young man managed to get on the roof of the
only building near a Trump rally and take shots at Trump. He did this
despite Trump allegedly having the best personal security available to
an American. For some reason, none of these crack security guys thought
it was a good idea to guard the roof. Not only that, but they were also
in the building and somehow managed to not hear a man walking around on
the metal roof above their heads.

Just that bit of the story is explainable as incompetence. We live in
the age of increasing incompetence, especially with the managerial
class. Then we learn that the shooter, who was killed on the scene, is
the only young person on planet earth without an extensive internet
profile. He also happens to be a kid from a tiny town in flyover country
that was in a Black Rock ad. Now we
<a href="https://x.com/JD_Cashless/status/1838969222476468587"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">learn</a> that an off-duty ATF agent in a
suit was there taking pics of the corpse.

Any one of those points are farfetched at face value, but the lack of
any explanation from the government makes the whole thing a one in a
billion event. At least it should be, but now we have another one to
pair with it. Last week we got
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y5l9jzjglo" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Ryan Routh</a> crawling around Trump’s golf course with
a rifle. How he got there and how he knew Trump would decide to get in a
round of golf that day is a mystery. Like the first assassination
attempt, this one makes no sense on the surface.

To date, no one has bothered to explain how this penniless kook managed
to travel around the world supporting Ukraine. No one has explained how
he got to Florida and how he acquired the rifle. He is a resident of
Hawaii, so he would not be able to buy a gun in the lower forty-eight.
Why did he drop off a box of ammo containing a <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/23/politics/ryan-wesley-routh-trump-assassination-attempt-letter/index.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">written confession</a> to an associate
months prior? Who was funding this guy and how did he end up in the
bushes outside Trump’s golf course?

No one knows and the government is not talking. The same people who
cannot shut up about disinformation and misinformation are perfectly
happy to let speculation run wild on these two bizarre events. It is
possible they do not know. Maybe they are as stumped as everyone else.
They could just say they are as baffled as everyone else, but instead
they now claim that Iranian hit squads are roaming the country looking
for their chance to take out Donald Trump.

To make the Iranian stuff fit in with the bizarreness of the two
assassination attempts, the secret police posted this
<a href="https://archive.is/haszr" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">story</a> in their media outlet claiming Trump is nuts
to think the Iranians are out to get him. Then in another media outlet,
the secret police say they <a
href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/trump-warned-of-alleged-iranian-assassination-threat-1/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">warned</a> Trump about the Iranian
assassination attempts. The one thing we know is that everything in the
media about the government is written by the government, so why do we
have these two conflicting reports from the government?

The general weirdness of these stories and the even stranger handling of
them by the regime is not the main topic of conversation because they
are not unique. They are part of a general pattern that has become the
new normal. We still have no plausible explanation for the pipe bomb
story the FBI put out during the election integrity protests of January
6, 2021. All we know for sure is someone planted them while the local
police looked on from their marked police vehicles.

In fairness, that is not the only thing we know about the events that
day. We have also learned that the Justice Department has been
stonewalling investigations into what actually happened on that day. We
know this because Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz
testified to it this week. In fact, he <a
href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-inspector-general-does-not-deny-fbi-informants-were-among-jan-6-crowd"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">volunteered</a> it and promised to keep
stonewalling until after the election. The strangest thing about this
admission is that no one seemed surprised.

You could probably write a book detailing the bizarre occurrences we
have seen over the last ten years since Trump arrived. You would not
have to offer an explanation or a conspiracy theory to any of them. Just
provide the known facts and maybe a few blank pages for official
explanations. That really is the remarkable bit about what has been
happening since Trump came down the escalator. It is not the explosion
of anomalies, but the silence from official sources.

What this suggests is that maybe there is no general conspiracy at work,
but rather a breakdown of control at the top. The reason no one can
explain how in the hell that kid got on the roof of that building in
Pennsylvania is no one in the regime really knows for sure who is
working which caper. In other words, it is not a desperate effort to
maintain control by the people at the top, but a breakdown of their own
internal control mechanisms leading to seemingly random rogue behavior.
