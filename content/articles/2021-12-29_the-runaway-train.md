A popular topic on this side of the great divide is how much of what we
see from the ruling class is directed and how much is emergent. Put
another way, how much of it is the result of conscious coordination from
some central source and how much is just the mentality of the swarm.
Those who like conspiracy theories and simple answers prefer the
coordination model, while those with experience in complex human systems
prefer the emergent behavior approach.

Of course, both can be true. Elites in the anglosphere have been
enamored by what is called nudge theory for a while now. the 2008 book
*Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness* was a
big hit with the managerial class, as it suggested a feminine way to
compel social behavior. Instead of ordering people around, elites would
use their power over the institutions to “nudge” people in the preferred
direction with positive incentives, rather than force.

As is so often the case, Nudge Theory is really an old idea tarted up
with managerial class jargon that comes from the graduate schools. The
tax code in America has been used this way long before the nudge idea.
The mortgage interest deduction is a nudge toward home ownership, rather
than renting. Business gets tax breaks for capital purchases when the
economy is flagging. The government food pyramid is a way to nudge
people toward one form of consumption over another.

The food pyramid is a good example of how conspiracy and emergent
behavior work together in a mass society. The people behind the food
pyramid are the giant agricultural concerns that control the food
supply. A high carbohydrate diet is more profitable than a healthy diet,
so they bribe government officials and academic researchers to promote
the high carb diet. At the same time, people actually believe in the
“low fat” diets now so no nudging is required.

We are seeing this with the Covid drama. The inner party has finally
realized they have a serious problem on their hands with Covid theater.
People have figured out that they can get two weeks out of work by
claiming to have Covid, so the great winter sick-out is starting to harm
the economy. Of course, the contradictions and lies about Covid are
undermining their ability to tell future lies. Biden’s last speech on
Covid came with a message to the media to cool it on Covid.

The White House is pushing a message to the media, which they expect the
media to blast through their megaphones. You are starting to see planted
stories about how Omicron is harmless and a good sign. On the other
hand, the hive mind of the media has been tuned to spread fear about
Covid. The front page of party organs like the New York Times are
organized around Covid theater. The result is a weird whipsaw effect
where the message swings wildly back and forth.

Covid theater is useful in exploring the hive mind aspects of this age.
All of a sudden, tens of millions of normal people are made aware of the
fact that many of their associates are not just liberal, but possibly
insane. The people wearing ceremonial face gear are exempting themselves
from the normal tribe and declaring their allegiance to the crazy tribe.
One sort of emergent behavior, triggered by the Covid conspirators, is
causing new emergent behavior among the healthy.

Those big tanker trucks you see on the road are a good model to think
about when considering this stuff. Inside those tanks is either
compartments or what would look like a baffles if you peeled back the
skin. The point of the internal structures is to give the tank rigidity
but also prevent the fluid inside from sloshing around. A ton of water
sloshing forward when braking would create a tremendous amount of force.
The tankers are designed to keep the contents stable in transport.

That is a good way to think of society. The hive mind, the emergent
behavior is like the fluid inside one of those tankers. When the ruling
class jams on the brakes or takes a sudden turn, general opinion can
swing wildling in one direction. The initial Covid panic is a good
example. The baffling is supposed to be local institutions, community
and the traditions of society. They are supposed to put a brake on the
wild swings of opinion caused by the sudden lurching of the ruling
class.

This is the proper image for modern America. It is a tanker truck racing
down the road half full of fluid. During the Trump years it swung from
one side of the road to the other, in part due to the driver and due to
the sloshing about inside the tank. The Biden turn at the wheel was
supposed to stabilize things, but every reaction on their part to
stabilize things has caused a new action inside the tank. Trump enjoyed
the ride, while Biden is hanging on like prisoner to the machine he is
driving.

The point is, much of what looks like conspiracy is just wild reactions
to events that the elites set off by a legitimate effort to nudge
society in a preferred direction. Just as war plans do not survive
contact with the enemy, elite conspiracies do not hold up very long
after contact with mass society. Covid is revealing just how little
control our ruling elites have over their creations. They unleashed a
panic that has become a bizarre subculture they no longer can control.

This does not settle the question at the start, but it does suggest the
question is not all that important. Unless you are inclined to believe
that the people “really in charge” are super-geniuses able to play
four-dimensional chess, yet not realize you are onto them, it is hard to
see the hand of design in the current madness. On the other hand,
emergent behavior does not explain the players who are fortuitously
positioned to profit from the madness unleashed by our rulers.

Perhaps the way to think about is as a process that evolves and two of
the forces driving the evolution are conspiracy and emergent behavior.
The former is locked in on short term gain without considering the long
term consequences. The later forces are just the normal social forces
weaponized by the collapse of that internal baffling that comes from
strong local community and traditions. The empire is a runaway train and
all of us, the engineers included, are just along for the ride.
