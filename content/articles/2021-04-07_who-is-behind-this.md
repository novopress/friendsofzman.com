Most Americans have always understood that their politicians are not
really in charge of the government or even their own offices. The secret
hand of “special interests” guide the daily functioning of the state. In
the old days this meant rich guys from the world of business, local
interest in the home state of the representative and powerful people
with connections inside government. These days it is those things plus
government unions and foreign powers like Israel and China.

Despite the role of special interests, people still participated in the
democratic process on the assumption that everything has a limit. Those
special interests manipulating the system would have to yield to popular
will eventually. After all, those politicians have interests too. If
they keep finking on their voters, they will find themselves on the
losing end of the next election. Even the most craven politician would
eventually have to draw the line with the money men telling him how to
vote.

A regular plot in movies and television is the politician who has a
crisis of conscience over some issue and he turns on the money men in
support of the people. Alternatively, and now quite amusingly, a heroic
member of the press exposes the shady backroom deals to the public. The
public, having been informed of the shady dealings, turns on the
participants. Sometimes it is a combination of these plots, but in the
end the public will triumphs over the shady backroom dealers.

When you stop and think about it, the way in which politics and the
media are presented in movies and television is a masterful bit of
propaganda. On the one hand, it fully acknowledges the corruption of all
democratic politics. The people in the system are always bad people. On
the other hand, the bad guys always lose to the good guys, the voters,
so it is proof that the system works. In other words, political
corruption is turned into proof that the system works. That is some real
4-D chess.

If you want to take the 4-D chess idea further, you can add in the
occasional arrest of a shady politician for political corruption. These
scandals are always turned into morality tales by the authorities and
the media. The FBI starts dishing dirt about the target to stenographers
in the media. Then they coordinate with the media for the big day when
the scoundrel is hauled away in chains. Often, the story is then
forgotten, as it has served its purpose in reinforcing the narrative of
democracy.

Of late, something seems to be broken with the system. It started with
the governor of South Dakota, who vetoed a bill banning men from playing
girls sports. Krisiti Noem, despite spelling her name like a stripper
and looking like the antihero of a country music video, was being
prepped for a national role. Then all of a sudden, for no clear reason,
she decided to support men playing girls’ sports. She was forced to go
on [Tucker Carlson](https://youtu.be/6jy_oG4gcSw) to humiliate herself
in service to the “trans” agenda.

Just this week, this same bizarre pattern repeated itself. Asa
Hutchinson, the neocon governor of Arkansas, vetoed a bill that would
have banned the mutilation of children, whose hysterical mothers
believed were another sex. Even if you think men should be allowed to
mutilate themselves with sex change operations, subjecting children to
things like chemical castration is monstrous. Yet, Hutchinson vetoed the
bill and then [went on Tucker](https://youtu.be/01Hry1rJn7w) to
humiliate himself in service to the “trans” agenda.

It is not unreasonable to ask what in the hell is going on here?
Normally this is the sort of issue that politicians love. They get to
pretend to heroically oppose something without risking any political
capital. After all, only deviants and sadists support the mutilation of
children, so opposing it is risk-free. It is not as if there is a lot of
votes in the transvestite community or some philosophical point here,
like with drug legalization. Transvestites are few and most are poor due
to their mental illness.

In the case of Noem, she was responding to demands from the NCAA, who
threatened to pull their events from the state. One of Noem’s donors
owns facilities that would profit from these events. That just leads to
a further question. Why does the NCAA, which promotes the hell out of
women’s sports, want to support the destruction of women’s sports by
transvestites? What is their interest here? In a way, they are being put
in the same humiliating position as the politicians.

The answer seems to be corporate America. In the interview with Asa
Hutchinson, Tucker asked him repeatedly if the mega-corps in his state
like Walmart had pressured him to support the mutilation of children.
Hutchinson got very uncomfortable, as if he suspected Tucker knew the
answer before he asked. The governor denied he talked to any of those
companies, but the viewer was left with the impression that he was being
forced to do what he was doing by those companies.

The trouble with blaming corporate America is they have less of a reason
to support these monstrous policies than the politicians. The political
class is largely insulated from the voters these days. Over 95% of
incumbents win reelection. The number of contested seats in the House,
for example, is 25-50, depending upon the election and who is in the
White House. In other words, the pols can afford to embrace boutique
ideas, like allowing men in drag to play girl’s field hockey.

Corporations, in theory at least, are not insulated from the public. A
boycott of Walmart is not going to bankrupt them, but it can impact the
business. Even if they are not worried about that, what is the point of
embracing this madness? It is not going to increase business. Surely,
they have to know it. The fact is though, it appears that the engine of
revolutionary social change, like the ritual mutilation of children, is
being driven by global corporations.

The motivations at work here are important, but the issue at the moment
is that this naked display of power is breaking the old myth of
democracy. Suddenly, those “special interests” are not a force to be
checked by popular will. They are not operating in the shadows, fearing
exposure. They are right out in front. Using these cases to tell the
people their opinions do not matter. It does not matter what they think.
The people in charge are the mega-corps and they will do as they please.
