Feeling a little worldly this week. I have been finishing up travel
plans for the spring hater’s season, so I have been thinking about the
world quite a bit. People noticed that the candidates did not field any
questions about foreign affairs in the Democrat debate this week. That
was supposed to mean something, but the truth is Americans have lost
interest in the world under Trump. That’s not a terrible thing, as we
have plenty of problems to deal with in our own backyard.

Still, it is important to keep up with what is going on in the world,
especially in the provinces, where there are some good lessons for
dissidents. The Europeans have been doing right-wing populism and
nationalism for a long time, so they are better at it than we are in the
States. That’s because they have been dealing with left-wing terrorism
for a lot longer too. They had to contend with groups like Antifa long
before they became an issue for Americans.

Of course, as the center of the Empire, the problems of the world will
always end up at our doorstep, so there is no hiding from it. The
plagues in Africa will be a problem for the West, just as the Wu-tang
fever will be a problem. Both are warnings about what’s coming our way
if we remain on the present course. When you build a house of cards,
even a gentle breeze is a dire threat. That’s the result of globalism.
The small problems on the fringe of civilization become huge problems.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
below.
