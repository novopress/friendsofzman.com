The show is a bit slapdash this week since I have been burning the
candle at both ends for the last two weeks. Work projects have had me
pinned to the workstation from dawn to dusk and beyond. The last week I
have been up at six and working well past midnight, so I am running on
fumes. There are worse things than being busy, like having no work to
do, but there are limits. I need a vacation.

At the start of the Covid panic I noticed an uptick in work requests. It
made some sense as the lockdowns threw everything up in the air. We are
long past that point in this area and in most areas. Even though lots of
people are still working from home, which should be the new normal at
this point. Despite a return to normalcy, my workload continues to rise
suggesting other forces are at play.

One answer is the accelerating baby boomer retirement. Those old whites
are being replaced by people who are differently abled. If you have seen
the ads for the Google Career Certificate, you can see the problem. The
moaning about the baby boomers always misses an essential point. There
are lots of them doing essential work and when they are gone, there is
not one to replace them.

Something else I notice is that the people who could be competent either
have little interest or they are unprepared. Business has always
struggled to find enough good people, but now it is acute. There are
people who can do the work, but they do not want to do the work. It is
one of the side effects of a transactional society. We cultivated a
couple of generations to treat work like a Tinder date.

Whatever the reason, I find myself busier than at any time in my life,
so something has to give and this week it is production quality. I
literally turned the mic on, started talking, played it back and hit
send. Usually, I have a few hours of prep, a couple of hours to record
and couple hours to edit. Sadly, I noticed no difference in the audio
quality which means I have been wasting time the last few years.

The topic this week is one I will return to when time permits. We really
do need a dissident framework through which to interpret the news. The
Trump raid is a good example of the need for new tools. We are being hit
with a firehose full of government lies, media lies, Trump opportunism
and grifter hot takes. The goal for dissident politics is to reach a
point where none of this is effective.

never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is a tea,
