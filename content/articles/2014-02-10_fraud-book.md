There is no way to check the details of this, but the fact the video has
not been struck down the creator has not been sued, suggests it is not a
slander of Facebook. Indian is known for hosting click farms and similar
scams. One of the weird products of global village is the village idiots
are easy to spot. Hindus will patiently sit in click farms, creating
fake traffic for web sites. Russians, on the other hand, will never do
it. Instead, they are better at gypsy scams like selling fake shoes and
penis pills. The Philippines is another great place to setup click
farms. The new thing is to setup outbound call center there because most
speak English. That’s another job Russians would never do.

Anyway, it is a good idea to be suspicious of Facebook. It is one of
those services that is great as long as it is free. If they start
charging for it, the whole thing collapses. That leaves advertising, but
that’s a limited game as well. Plaster the site with ads and people get
turned off. Plus, ads are often the source of malware and most users
have ad blockers. Then you have the mobile problem. Microscopic ads on a
phone are worthless. The quality of advertising is another issue. Like a
most internet advertising, the stuff on Facebook is aimed at the
impulsive and stupid.

Now it seems the scam is different. They are getting companies to setup
pages and then pay to get traffic to their page. Since no one in their
right mind goes to a corporate FB page, they are using robots to fool
the companies. It is a clever scam, but an old one. Pyramid schemes
often work this way. Psychics have always used plants to trap suckers.
They were also caught putting stuff on people’s home pages that was
supposedly liked by a friend. It was pretty ham handed and they said it
was an error, but no one should believe Mark Zuckerberg. Everything
about that guy screams grifter.
