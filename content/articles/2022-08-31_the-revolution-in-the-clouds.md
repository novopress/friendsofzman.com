An enduring question on this side of the great divide is over the
motivation of the Cloud People as they go about their war on the Dirt
People. Is there some grand plan behind the war or is it some weird
instinctual thing? Are they motivated by base instincts like money and
power or is it something spiritual? There is the “deep state versus
emergent behavior” angle but also the simple question about whether
these people have the self-awareness to grasp what they are doing at
all.

For example, the war on Russia was launched six months ago and at the
time it was clear to most people that the cost to the West would be
high. The question was about the cost to the Russians. Given the dismal
history of economic sanctions and the public utterances of Russian
leaders, sober minded people saw the sanctions regime as a high risk and
extremely low reward gamble. That quickly became an all risk and no
reward strategy that was doomed to fail.

Despite the obviousness of it all, the West kept doubling down on the
program as if they were on the right side of history. Now people are
getting gas bills in Europe that are five and ten times normal.
Europeans are <a
href="https://www.zerohedge.com/energy/how-name-god-shocked-europeans-post-astronomical-energy-bills-terrifying-winter-approaches"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">posting</a> their utility bills on-line
as a desperate effort to get attention to the issue. For reasons no one
has bothered to explain, Western media is not treating this as an
important story. They are not grilling Western leaders on the situation
or even asking them questions.

Are these people just so cut off from reality that they simply do not
know what is happening in their countries? Is someone like Liz Truss so
insulated from reality that she is unaware of things called electric
bills? Since no one has bothered to ask her about the issue, it is
possible she does not know. It seems crazy but staggering ignorance
would explain why this is happening. The Cloud People do live vastly
different lives from the Dirt People.

That does not explain the media silence. Scan the British media and you
would come away with the impression that there is no economic crisis. It
is all stories about the royals, local celebrities and childish
political drama. The German media has bland stories about the latest ten
point plan from the party. Those are stuffed in between press releases
from the Gaia cult like this <a
href="https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/klimaforscher-rockstroem-ueber-energiekrise-die-regierung-koennte-eine-soziale-eskalation-noch-verhindern-a-58be8894-665d-4144-aabc-449dd042bd08"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">one</a>. They worry that people freezing
to death in their homes this winter could anger Gaia.

What in the world is going on here? The worst economic catastrophe to
befall Europe in generations is being ignored. Is this a strategy by the
Cloud People or are they just so cut off from reality they do not see
this as a big deal? This <a
href="https://summit.news/2022/08/29/german-green-party-minister-calls-for-tax-on-meat/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">lunatic</a> from the German Church of
Gaia wants to tax meat at a time of soaring food costs. Is this nut so
ideologically blinkered that he does not see how this looks? Normal
people will be forgiven for thinking he is a deranged sadist.

This is where another motivation creeps into the picture. Maybe what
lies behind all of this is a seething hatred of the Dirt People. The
reason they are not focusing on the crisis is they are showing
restraint. In private they are laughing at the prospect of Dirt People
heating their homes with candles this winter. Those shop owners going
out of business gives them a sexual thrill. This crisis is the revenge
of the Cloud People on the Dirt People for not dying off during Covid.

That last bit is further proof that vengeance may be the real motivation
behind these abusive polices we see in the West. It was clear from the
start that the Covid polices were something of a tantrum by the Cloud
People. They made people humiliate themselves with masks and social
distancing out of spite. The vaccine mandates now look like an attempted
genocide. <a
href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/longevity/588738-huge-huge-numbers-death-rates-up-40-percent-over-pre/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Deaths</a> among the young and healthy
are at frighteningly high levels across the West.

There have been times in history when the people concluded that their
rulers were corrupt, stupid or tyrannical. In the furor leading up to
the revolt the rabble-rousers would caricature the rulers as ruthless
and vindictive. In reality, the rulers were either incompetent or simply
unlucky. In order to properly revolt, the people needed to be convinced
that their rulers were more than just stupid. They were bad people who
deserved what was coming to them.

We may be experiencing the first example where a ruling class is evil,
but the rabble rousers among the ruled cannot bring themselves to accept
it. It is the mirror image of the revolutionary model where all
restraint is lost among the ruling class while the people desperately
try to maintain the status quo. The people at the top have all the money
and power, which for some reason has led them to revolt against the
system that makes their status as elites possible.

The other side of this revolution in the clouds is the placidity of the
Dirt People in the face of this war of extinction. Perhaps this is what
has driven the ruling class into a murderous rage. No matter how hard
they try, they cannot rouse the people to defend themselves or their
culture. The rage is not exactly at the people, but at the ruddy sunset
of the West. Modernity has made the people so feeble; they can no longer
defend themselves from predators.

Regardless of the reasons, the revolution in the clouds will continue
until the Dirt People can be roused from their stupor or they simply
succumb. One way or the other, the revolution can only end with the
death of the Cloud People. Surely, they must see this, which means that
is the ultimate aim. Self-abnegation is the highest virtue of the new
religion and one way or another, they will achieve it. The only question
that really matters is if they will take Western civilization with them.
