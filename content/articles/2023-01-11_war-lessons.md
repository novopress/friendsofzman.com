Most likely, the first war in human history was one group of guys
rushing at another group of guys, swinging fists and anything they could
use as a club. It did not take long before a man decided that it was a
good idea to use his hunting weapons to ward off these attacks or
compliment these attacks. After all, if a gang of men with spears could
take down a large animal, the same tactics would work on humans. From
there the arms race was on among the human species.

The club was probably the first weapon of war. The spear would be the
first tool converted for use in war. The shield was the first tool of
war created specifically for use in combat against other men. Unlike the
club, the shield was not just lying around waiting for a man to use it
in a fight. Unlike the spear, the shield was not something used for
hunting. The shield was a practical response to men using their spears
to poke at you in a fight. It was the dawn of the arms industry.

We have no way of knowing if any of that is true. The first men were not
big on writing stuff down so we are left to speculate. Maybe the crazies
are right and people are naturally peaceful until a weapon is
introduced. Some guy brought his spear to the clan meeting and this
caused the clans to break out into warfare. Perhaps humans were
vegetarians, eating what they could find until one guy picked up a stick
and then immediately decided to start beating people with it.

Putting that aside, the history of war has been one side finding new
ways to get around opposing defenses, while the other side finds new
ways to block or reduce the weapons the other side is using. We are
seeing this in Ukraine as the Russians work through the puzzle that is
the Ukrainian defense network. For close to a decade the United States
worked with Ukraine on their tactics, defenses and training. The
Ukrainians were as ready as they could be for this war.

One of the first problems the Russians faced was the well designed
Ukrainian air defense system. This was a carry over from the Soviet
days. During the Cold War, the Russians planned to defend themselves
against superior American airplanes, so they designed advanced air
defense systems. These things are always hotly debated, but the
consensus is that the Russians are the best in the world at building
surface-to-air missile systems for defending against planes and
missiles.

Of course, this was the same problem presented to NATO. The Russians
have even better air defense systems than the Ukrainians. They can take
out the best aircraft from great distances. This is why the Pentagon was
adamantly against imposing a no fly zone over Ukraine. Losing billion
dollar aircraft on a daily basis is a good way to lose popular support
for a proxy war. It is also why there was never any thought about
training Ukrainian pilots on the F-35.

That is the first lesson of this war. Outside of asymmetric wars, like
America attacking a weak country, manned combat aircraft is becoming
obsolete. Surface-to-air missile systems are reaching the stage where
they can defeat the best manned aircraft at pennies on the dollar. If
you can take out a billion dollar plane with a million dollar missile,
it is not going to take long before the other side stops using their
billion dollar planes to attack you.

That is another lesson of the war. Wars between peers are about
economics, not flashy displays of technological prowess. Each side must
try to reduce the per unit cost of destroying the opponents assets and
defending its own assets. Assuming equal number of assets at the start,
the game becomes a contest of efficiency. The side that can run the war
most cost effectively wins. We are seeing that in Ukraine as the frugal
Russians grind down the extravagantly financed Ukrainians.

That brings up another lesson of this war. The vaunted American military
industrial complex is being revealed to be a bigger fraud than
suspected. Last summer, Alex Vershinin <a
href="https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/return-industrial-warfare"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">pointed</a> out the problems in the
Western military industrial capacity versus that of the Russians. He
concluded that the West simply lacked the industrial capacity to wage
this war. In December Brian Berletic did a similar
<a href="https://journal-neo.org/2022/12/23/the-ukraine-arms-drain/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> on this topic, which had been
covered in the <a href="https://archive.vn/efZl0" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Washington Post</a> and
<a href="https://archive.vn/p8ia2" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Financial Times</a>.

The United States has spent roughly a trillion dollars per year on
weapons but there is not enough stock to last a year in a real war. Even
if there is a shift toward ramping up production, it will take years to
match the Russians and Chinese. In some cases, the ability to make the
stuff has been lost. Once the contract with the military was fulfilled,
the men and facilities to make the stuff was repurposed. For those cases
it means starting production from scratch.

It actually is worse than anyone is letting on. The Pentagon refuses to
consider supplying Ukraine with Abrams tanks. One reason is it takes a
year to train a crew to competently operate the thing. The main reason,
however, is these tanks are extremely fragile outside of optimum
environments. Their size and complexity require a massive supply chain
to keep the things running. That is great for the contractors, but it is
an enormous liability for an army at war.

Probably the biggest lesson thus far is that drones are changing the
battlefield in ways no one anticipated. Faced with massive defense
works, the Russians were reduced to using their artillery advantage to
pound the Ukrainians. Cheap drone technology has allowed them to
efficiently target enemy positions and selectively hunt for opposing
machines using inexpensive weapons. The cheap drone is not only a new
weapon on the battlefield it is a force multiplier.

Of course, the biggest lesson is that fighting in your backyard is much
easier than fighting across the sea. The Russians have short tight
supply lines because Ukraine is right on her border. The Ukrainians,
reliant on American money and material, have supply lines stretched
thin. Those donated tanks and artillery pieces have to be shipped to
Poland to be repaired. Another lesson of this war is that supply chain
is as important as the weapons and ammunition it supplies.

Whether anyone in the West is learning anything from this is hard to
know, but most likely the corruption is so thick that none of this is
making sense to them. Making billion dollar jet fighters is much more
fun and profitable than producing cheap drone technology or building
better field artillery. If these lessons will be learned at all it will
be in a colossal failure in the Pacific. That seems to be where the
military industrial complex is <a
