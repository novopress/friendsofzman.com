Something I noticed putting together last week’s show is I have fallen
into a pattern as far as material and format. That’s a good thing as
without order, there is chaos, but the orderliness of the show has left
out some things I like doing. I had not done a Xirl science in a while,
for example. When I started this, I was just grabbing random stuff that
I found entertaining, without thinking about how it fit together. That’s
how I stumbled into the whole Xirl science gag and the black science gag
and the libertarian bashing.

Anyway, I decided that once in a while, for variety, I should put
together a podcast the way I used to do it. That way I can mock
libertarians, which I will henceforth call NAP-bashing, and do some Xirl
science. This also helps when I am short on time or stumped for ideas,
as it is easy to surf the Reason site or the twitter feed for New Peer
Review for material that I can use for the show. To do a one hour
podcast each week probably consumes about ten hours of time each week,
spread out over the entire week.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I’m now on
Spotify, so the millennials can tune in when not sobbing over white
privilege and toxic masculinity.
