Back in Obama’s first months on the throne, Rick Santelli, a TV
personality, was “reporting” from the floor of the stock exchange. He
responded to a question about Obama’s housing plan with a rant
about socialism, finishing it off with a call for a new Tea Party.
Whether it was spontaneous or choreographed is hard to know, but at the
time people took it to be entirely spontaneous. Santelli is a carny
barker prone to getting carried away on the air and his rant had the
feel of an old fashioned stem winder.

Regardless of the intent or the execution, the rant went viral and the
Tea Party Movement was born. Middle America was ready to be pissed off
due to the terribleness of the Bush years, so Obama’s poor start put the
normies in a fighting mood. Before long people were showing up at town
hall meetings, dressed as Samuel Adams, giving their congressman the
business about reckless government behavior that had made a hash of
things. Since the Democrats were the majority, they got the brunt of the
abuse.

It did not take long for the moonbats to declare the whole thing a
racist conspiracy cooked up by the twelfth invisible Hitler in league
with the eternal cyclops of the KKK. This was when the fake hate crime
stuff got its start as a daily phenomenon. It was also when it became
apparent to a lot of people that the news is mostly fake. The
increasingly deranged Nancy Pelosi, slurring about “Astroturf” was so
weird, it begged a challenge, but the news people carried on like it was
manifestly true.

The claim that middle aged suburbanites, dressed in tricorne hats, were
paid agents of a nefarious conspiracy was so nutty that the response
from the press should have been laughter and then derision. After all,
it has been known for decades that the Left uses rent-a-mobs. They pay
people to show up and hold signs. Unions have been doing this since the
days of Jimmy Hoffa. For the Democrats to clutch their pearls and call
the Tea Party inauthentic should have been too much of a farce for even
the very liberal press corp.

I’ve often wondered if that was when a lot of people started to think
the corruption in Washington was worse than they imagined. The
corruption of the Tea Party by Conservative Inc surely turned a lot of
people to the dark side, but the priming agent may well have been the
AstroTurf stuff. It was so obvious that the media was coordinating their
coverage with the Left, it was hard not to notice it. The game was
rigged and nothing in the media was on the level. It was not just bias,
it was collusion.

The question is, how fake is it? <a

Since so much of the mass media is now intertwined with social media,
the authenticity of social media is a useful proxy for the authenticity
of the mass media. It’s right to assume that
<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-38724082"

This would explain the strange disparity in followers you see in
Twitter. I’ve had people with tens of thousands of followers post a link
to this site and the traffic was a few click throughs. On the other
hand, a Ricky Vaughn tweet would net thousands of hits in minutes and it
would last hours. That told me real humans were reading his timeline. It
also suggests that those follower counts for allegedly famous people may
be fake. <a

target="_blank">We know people have bought followers for social
media</a>, but the scale has never been examined.

That may be changing. <a
href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-09/fake-newsflow-are-ny-times-guardian-and-wapo-buying-clicks-china-jumps-trickle-half-"
target="_blank">ZeroHedge used on-line traffic tools to figure out that
major news sites have most likely hired Chinese click farms</a> to help
them game their traffic numbers, even though these sites are blocked in
China. These sorts of solicitations come through the contact page of
this site on a daily basis so it is nothing new. If the big major sites
have succumbed to temptation in order to fraudulently boost their
traffic counts, it is safe to assume all of them are doing it.

None of this surprises those who turned to the dark side when Darth
Vader was still in knickers.
<a href="http://nypost.com/2010/07/25/the-fix-was-in/"
target="_blank">The JournoList scandal</a> was thrown down the memory

you have been following these things. But now, the general public is
noticing that not only is the news fake, the people behind it <a

target="_blank">look a lot like people our betters have been warning us
about for years</a>.

What may push everyone over the edge is the mother of all fake news
stories, the entirely fictional Russian Hacking™ scandal. There is
nothing about this that passes the laugh test. No one can even explain
what it is the Russians supposedly did. No one can explain how Trump
people talking to Russians is different from everyone else who regularly
talks with Russians. It’s as if the media has been infected with a rage
virus. Of course, it’s obvious that the hysteria is part of an
orchestrated campaign to undermine Trump.

In other words, it’s all fake.

And it will end poorly.
