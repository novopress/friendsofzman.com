today.

*The deadlift may be the simplest and easiest exercise to learn in all
of barbell training. You pick up a loaded barbell and set it back down,
keeping the bar in contact with your legs the whole way. There are a few
subtle complications — the bar should move up and down the legs in a
vertical line over the middle of the foot, the bar should start from a
position directly over the mid-foot, and you should keep your back flat
when you pull. But that’s really about all there is to it. The deadlift
is one of the basic movements of which strength training is composed.*

*Pulling things off the ground is a part of your human heritage, and
bending down to pick them up is what your knees and hips are for. With
the bar in your hands and your feet against the floor, your whole body
is completely involved in the exercise, which means the deadlift makes
the whole body strong. It would be very difficult to invent a more
natural exercise for the body than picking up a progressively heavier
barbell.*

In America, a lot of time and energy is spent lecturing people about
their weight, their diet and their lack of exercise. Health clubs, it
seems to me, largely exist on people who feel guilty about not
exercising. Around the holidays they resolve to get in better shape and
join a gym. By March they have stopped going.

The thing that has always puzzled me is why weight training is not
offered up as the low-cost and sensible way for people to stay in shape.
It’s cheap. A decent setup for at home is a few hundred bucks if you’re
sensible. For the typical person, an hour, three nights per week, is
enough to stay fit, as long as you’re sensible about the diet.

Instead, it is one exotic exercise regime and fad after another. Weight
training, in the minds of most people, is for steroidal meathheads with
the IQ of a goldfish. At least that’s how it is presented. The truth is
most of those meatheads are pretty smart. They’ve spent years learning
biochemistry and physiology. The public perception, however, is that
weight training is for morons.
