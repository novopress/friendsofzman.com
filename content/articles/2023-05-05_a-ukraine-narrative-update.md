The war in Ukraine had dropped off the front page starting late last
year with the Russians slowly grinding down the Ukrainians. Now that
summer is not far away, it looks like things will start heating up. The
recent drone attacks on the Kremlin have brought the war back to the
front pages. The long promised Ukrainian offensive is due any week now
and the Russians seem to be preparing something as well.

The drone attack on the Kremlin is another one of those times where you
get a glimpse into the psyche of the people running the war for the
regime. They greenlight a caper and then claim that the victim of the
caper did it to himself. We saw this with the Nord Stream pipeline
attack. At first, they cheered, then they made up a story about how the
Russians blew up their own pipelines to make Washington look bad.

In this case, the story is the Russians attacked their own buildings so
they can have an excuse to kill Zelensky. Poor Zelensky is traveling
around Europe right now thinking he is about to get a polonium cocktail
from room service. In his last public appearance, he looked like he was
about to cry. There is now talk that he may not return to Ukraine at all
and just do his job by zoom.

The thing is this caper is a good example of how easily things can get
out of hand when you let private actors conduct foreign policy. The
attack was no doubt cooked up by the neocons running foreign policy.
They have friends at private military and security firms that help the
Ukrainians with planning and materials. Maybe British intelligence helps
out, off the books naturally.

Unlike the Nord Stream bombing, which was signed off on by Joe Biden, it
appears this stunt was done without the admin being told. This is why
they sounded even more ridiculous than usual when asked about it. They
did not have their cover stories prepared, so they were forced to wing
it. That only made things worse, as their instinct is always to lie,
which made them look even guiltier.

What this all points to is that the Kagan cult thinks they have one last
shot to start a nuclear war with Russia, so they will be pulling out all
the stops. That means Ukraine is about to get interesting this summer.
Not only will we get the long promised Ukrainian offensive, but we will
get lots of random terrorist attacks, along with some efforts to make
the big dramatic splash like we saw this week.
