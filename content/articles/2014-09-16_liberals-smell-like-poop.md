So says <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this story from The Week</a>;

*A new study from the American Journal of Political Science indicates
that different political affiliations may actually correspond with
different body odors.*

*The researchers, led by Brown University political scientist Rose
McDermott, found that conservatives and liberals smell dissimilar. While
the difference is small, it is apparently significant enough that we
subconsciously prefer the scent of those who vote like we do. “It
appears nature stacks the deck to make politically similar partners more
attractive to each other in unconscious ways,” the researchers wrote.
“Conservatives smell like flowers and sunshine, while Liberals smell
faintly of raw sewage and rotten eggs.”*

OK, I made that last part up. My point is if it did say that, people
would buy it. Social science is not science and nonsense like this is
the reason.

*Previous research has found a number of other political view
correlations with unknown degrees of biological and cultural influences.
From eating preferences (the left likes strawberry jelly, while the
right favors grape) to alcohol choices (Republicans like brown liquors;
Democrats drink the clear stuff), conservatives and liberals live as
distinctly as they vote.*

*Other differences are more psychological: Conservatives will look at an
unpleasant image 15 percent longer than liberals, and they’re also more
likely to keep an organized dorm room in college. In fact, one study
showed that conservatives are more generally conscientious and liberals
are more open to new experiences. Libertarians display some
psychological aspects of both groups, albeit with a far lighter helping
of respect for authority.*

I’m fond of pointing out that the hive minded obsess over boundaries.
You see it in these crackpot studies. The Right, or what pass for the
Right these days, cares not a wit about this stuff. In fact, the Right
has taken to heart the baloney sold by the Cult regarding human
biodiversity. They really think we’re all the same. The Left is under no
such illusion. They know damn well there is a difference between those
inside the walls and those outside the walls. Hence this obsession for
these types of studies.
