rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Another Jewish guy is being
run out of the NBA</a> for noticing stuff. Atlanta Hawks owner Bruce
Levenson is selling his team after his private thought s about the black
people he owns were made public.

*Atlanta Hawks owner Bruce Levenson is selling his controlling interest
in the team, NBA commissioner Adam Silver announced Sunday.*

*In July, Levenson self-reported an email he wrote to the team’s
co-owners and general manager Danny Ferry in August 2012 that he called
“inappropriate and offensive.” The league commenced an independent
investigation after being made aware of the comments.*

*Levenson writes in a statement that the racially offensive comments
came as he pondered ways to bridge Atlanta’s racial sports divide and
increase fan attendance at Hawks’ games.*

*“In trying to address those issues, I wrote an e-mail two years ago
that was inappropriate and offensive,” he said. “I trivialized our fans
by making clichéd assumptions about their interests (i.e. hip hop vs.
country, white vs. black cheerleaders, etc.) and by stereotyping their
perceptions of one another (i.e. that white fans might be afraid of our
black fans). By focusing on race, I also sent the unintentional and
hurtful message that our white fans are more valuable than our black
fans.”*

*“If you’re angry about what I wrote, you should be,” Levenson continued
in the statement. “I’m angry at myself, too. It was inflammatory
nonsense. We all may have subtle biases and preconceptions when it comes
to race, but my role as a leader is to challenge them, not to validate
or accommodate those who might hold them.”*

*Levenson notified Silver on Saturday night of his intentions to sell.*

*“I commend Mr. Levenson for self-reporting to the league office, for
being fully cooperative with the league and its independent
investigator, and for putting the best interests of the Hawks, the
Atlanta community, and the NBA first,” Silver said in a statement.*

*Levenson had presided over the Hawks’ ownership group since 2004. Over
the past decade, the team has never ranked higher than 18th in
attendance and is largely overlooked in a market that also has the NFL,
Major League Baseball and a passion for college football.*

*Atlanta CEO Steve Koonin will now oversee all team operations.*

*The Hawks become the second NBA team to hit the market this year. The
Los Angeles Clippers were sold for an unprecedented $2 billion earlier
this summer to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer after former owner
Donald Sterling was banned for life by the league after his racist rant
to a woman became public.*

It should be noted that one NBA owner is a Russian mobster and one of
his partners got rich convincing young black males to slaughter one
another. But at least they don’t notice stuff, which is about the worst
thing a person can do these days.
