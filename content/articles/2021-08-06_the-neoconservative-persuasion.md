The title of the show this week is taken from the title of a book by the
guy most consider to be the founder of neoconservatism, Irving Kristol.
He was one of the first far-left intellectuals to break with the Left
and migrate to the new Right. He embraced the term neocon, in an “own
the insult” way, which is probably why the term has remained with us,
despite it originally being an insult. The Left used it as a way to
criticize their former colleagues for their break with them over various
issues.

Today, of course, our side uses the term as an insult. Even within what
is left of mainstream conservatism, the term and the people associated
with it is falling out of favor, especially as the neocons get nastier
in their critiques of populism. David French now sounds like a less
masculine version of Robin DiAngelo. That is not an exaggeration, as he
sounds like Mickey Mouse, and she sounds like she has had one too many
Pall Mall’s with her boiler makers.

Just as it is useful to understand the language of the Left, it is
useful to know the intellectual history of the legacy Right. When the
Left uses the slur “racist” they do not mean it in the way normal people
understand it. This is why it is stupid to debate them on those terms.
When you deny being a racist, you are legitimizing the term and their
definition of it. If you try to own the insult, you do the same. 
Instead, when you know their definition, you can attack them from the
moral high ground.

The same thing applies to the history of the neocons. Understanding why
they say America is an idea, rather than a nation, is key to dealing
with the claim. Someone like Ben Shapiro does not really know why he
believes America is just an idea. He was simply taught that by his
Straussian professors. The same is true of his chanting about
Judeo-Christianity. You can strip away the intellectual authority of the
claims when you know the source of it. Knowledge is power.

The other thing that we can learn from studying the neocons is how the
conservative movement was so easily coopted by them. The reason is that
the New Right, as it was called early on, had no moral philosophy of its
own. The Buckley movement started from a disposition and then became a
reaction to current events. They were not starting from a body of moral
philosophy that contradicted the Left. The neocons supplied a morality
framed by the founding documents.

It is why any genuine opposition to what is going on in the West must
first start with a moral philosophy that stands outside of the
prevailing orthodoxy. Only by being able to say, “this is who we are,
this is what we believe, this is why we believe it, and this is why it
is superior to the alternative” can a genuine alternative blossom.
Simply starting with a laundry list of outcomes, desired or opposed,
like the Buckley crew, means falling prey to the same sort of corruption
that killed conservatism.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
