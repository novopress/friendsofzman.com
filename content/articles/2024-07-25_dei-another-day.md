The ongoing saga over who is actually running the White House and who
will be the opponent of Donald Trump in the fall is a good example of
how the political class lacks second order thinking. When they bumped
off Biden, they did not think about what comes next, so they are now
stuck with Harris. It also reveals that these people have no
institutional memory, so they repeat past errors. In the case of Harris,
they seem to have learned nothing from the Obama experience.

Back during the great interregnum, when issues like race, affirmative
action, and demographics could be discussed, it was obvious that the
main failure of affirmative action programs was not that they did not
result in more blacks in the targeted area, but that the blacks
themselves often resented it. Everyone just assumed that these people
got where they were through affirmative action, rather than merit, so
those who thought they earned it hated the stigma that came with
affirmative action.

It is an important and overlooked part of race politics. The white
saviors who create and implement these race programs are not counting
heads looking for the correct number of brown people. They are looking
for salvation. That comes, they assume, when the black recipients of
their programs are grateful to the people behind them. The “failure” of
affirmative action was that it created black resentment, the exact
opposite of what the white saviors were expecting.

That aside, there were second and third order effects that no one
thought to consider, and they also contained an internal contradiction
that could not be covered up with moral language. You cannot have a
meritocratic, egalitarian society and at the same time have special
rights for certain people based on dubious claims about the suffering of
their ancestors. Good intentions and righteous indignation could not
obscure this reality nor stop people from acting on it.

Not only do our betters not think past their first move, but they also
never learn from their past errors, so affirmative action was rebranded.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, no matter how they frame it, is just
another set of lectures about how whites must overlook merit in order to
fill the ranks with nonwhites. The libraries full of books soaked in
emotive language on this topic delight and confuse the promoters of DIE
projects, but the fundamental facts remain. It is affirmative action.

This is why people like Christopher Rufo have found it so easy to
anathematize the term DEI and use it as a club to beat the managerial
class. The fact that this new branding easily converts to DIE made it
even easier. When a company CEO proudly states that his company will
replace whites with nonwhites in order to meet the goals of Diversity,
Equity, and Inclusion, in the minds of white people, the “great
replacement” move from abstraction to a direct threat.

In other words, the whole DEI program that evolved in response to the
moral failure of affirmative action pleased the people behind it, but
they never thought about how it would play outside the hothouse of the
academy. They never pondered the contradiction between mandatory
association and the internal logic of a society that strives to be an
egalitarian meritocracy. All they could see was the wonderfulness of
their first trick and the assumed ends that must come after it.

This is all coming together with the Kamala Harris campaign. Apparently,
not one remembers her 2020 primary run. No one remembers why they
carefully groomed and insulated Barak Obama. Instead, they just bumped
off Biden and assumed all their dreams would fall into place. Instead,
they have the face of DEI as the default option for the Democratic
nomination. Kamala Harris is the embodiment of everything the critics of
DEI have been saying for a decade.

This is why her polling is terrible, worse than Biden’s, and why she may
have to be replaced before the convention. White people see in Kamala
Harris the face behind those dreadful diversity seminars at the office.
Black people see the patronizing white women behind those same programs.
For both races, Harris is what middle-aged cat ladies imagine is the
ideal black woman. It is not that she is inauthentic, which is certainly
true, but that she is genuinely offensive.

Of course, the people who created this mess are now tasked with finding
a remedy to it, which means more obtuse shortsightedness. Reportedly the
Obama faction is unhappy with Harris, a member of the Clinton faction,
so they are floating the idea of Senator Mark Kelly as her running mate.
The problem there is it underscores the fact that Harris is a DEI
candidate. Fitting her with a competent white man not only highlights
her ineptitude, but confirms what critics say about DEI.

This is why there is a good chance that this scheme falls apart entirely
and the Democrats are left with a chaotic scramble at their convention.
The thing they hoped to avoid would be made possible by their thumbless
attempts to engineer a result that prevents an open convention. They
keep stepping on these rakes, because they never think past the first
move, and they learn nothing from past errors. The Democrats are now a
collection of high time preference amnesiacs.

All of this brings up a larger issue, one that will not go away when
this present fiasco has gone down the memory hole. Popular government
can only work in an orderly society, and you get an orderly society when
the people who make up that society agree that following the rules is of
paramount importance. This is not possible in a diverse society, which
must devolve into tribal factionalism. This is why the Framers warned
about the threat of factionalism to the republic.

The ongoing demographic collapse of America, and the West in general,
means the underlying requirement of Western style government is
collapsing. The chaotic, big man government we see evolving with the
Democrats is simply a product of the people who make up that party’s
coalition. In time, this will be the reality of American society, if the
demographic trends continue. The real choice behind these election
dramas is between order and diversity. You cannot have both.
