I got an chain e-mail today that read as follows:

> He is Edward “Ed” Mezvinsky, born January 17, 1937. Then you’ll
> probably say, “Who is Ed Mezvinsky?”
>
> Well, he is a former Democrat congressman who represented Iowa’s 1st
> congressional district in the United States House of Representatives
> for two terms, from 1973 to 1977.
>
> He sat on the House Judiciary Committee that decided the fate of
> Richard Nixon. He was outspoken saying that Nixon was a crook and a
> disgrace to politics and the nation and should be impeached.
>
> He and the Clintons were friends and very politically intertwined for
> many years.
>
> Ed Mezvinsky had an affair with NBC News reporter Marjorie Sue
> Margolies and later married her after his wife divorced him.
>
> In 1993, Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, then a freshman Democrat in
> Congress, cast the deciding vote that got President Bill Clinton’s
> controversial tax package through the House of Representatives.
>
> In March 2001, Mezvinsky was indicted and later pleaded guilty to 31
> of 69 counts of bank fraud, mail fraud, and wire fraud. Ed Mezvinsky
> embezzled more than $10 million dollars from people via both a Ponzi
> scheme and the notorious Nigerian e-mail scams. He was found guilty
> and sentenced to 80 months in federal prison. After serving less than
> five years in federal prison, he was released in April 2008 and
> remains on federal probation. To this day, he still owes $9.4 million
> in restitution to his victims.
>
> About now you are saying, “So what!”
>
> Well, this is Marc and Chelsea Mezvinsky.

My first thought was it was one of those made up conspiracy theory
things that gets recycled every administration. But, I remembered
Mezvinsky from the Nixon days so I looked it up anyway.
<a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/clintons/mezvinsky.asp"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here’s what Snopes has</a> on it. Turns
out it is true.

Steve Sailer likes to write about the deep state and I must admit I find
it enjoyable. I’m skeptical about conspiracy theories, but that does not
mean there are no conspiracies. What’s more common is the near
incestuous dealings in the political class. If you get elected to
Congress, the door is open for you and your tribe to join the ruling
class and stay there regardless of your actions. You need to win
re-election and prove you will not make any trouble for the people in
charge. Once you do that, you are granted tenure and even a lengthy trip
to the Federal can does not get you thrown out of the club.

That means your relatives can gain insider access to business deals
unavailable to the hoi polloi. Your kids go to tony private schools and
marry the kids of others in the political class. It’s a milder form of
the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_man_%28political_science%29"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">big man politics</a> so popular in
sub-Saharan Africa. In South America it results in a system where the
ruling elite will do anything to keep the peasants down in the valley.
In Africa and the Middle East it means the dominant tribe murders any
tribe that seems threatening, while the big man enjoys the benefits of
being the big man. In the Occident, its more subtle and more diffused,
because the smart fraction is much larger. Still, it is not hard to see
how it can ossify into something more insidious than just grubby theft
and graft.
