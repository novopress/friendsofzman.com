Upon my arrival, I was told by a friend that one of the women at the
Superbowl Party now had a lesbian daughter. The only reason to tell me
this was to give me a heads up so I could avoid having to talk about it
with the mother or daughter. This is one of those habits in modern times
that I don’t think existed in a prior age. Some friend of family member
gets caught up in a ridiculous fad and everyone has to pretend not to
notice or pretend to support it. The easy path is to pretend not to
notice. Otherwise you have to tiptoe through a minefield of nonsense.

In this case, the lesbian daughter was not actually a lesbian. The
fashion these days is for girls to declare themselves lesbian or
transgendered and then dress up to play the role for attention. The
mother went bonkers in college and joined the cult of feminism so it
makes perfect sense for the daughter to go in for the latest female fad.
The result is a teenager with blue hair, weird makeup and wearing boys
jeans.

I’m indifferent to these things simply because there’s nothing to be
said about it. Teens often look for ways to drive their parents crazy.
There’s not a lot left for kids to do so it is not surprising they are
picking up on the sexual confusion stuff. Even that is not terribly
original. In the 1970’s, hipster men would put on makeup and wear
sexually ambiguous clothes to the disco. <a

lesbian for much of the 70’s.

I was telling this to someone today while waiting for an elevator. A
nice African fellow overheard and chimed in with his opinion. Africans –
the real ones not the ones from Detroit – have a very low opinion of
homosexuality. This fellow was polite, but it was clear he was not down
with the new trend. He mentioned that it was very popular with girls in
the local high schools. He found it troubling. His question, a fair one
for sure, is where will the babies come from if the girls are lesbians?

That’s a reasonable question. Vermont, which appears to have based its
future on middle-aged homosexual men with a thing for antiquing, has
seen its school enrollments decline, along with its general population.
The grammar school population has seen the biggest drop, which means
things will get worse, not better. I don’t think their problems are due
to everyone turning gay in Vermont. I’m just making the point that you
have to have babies in order to keep things going and there’s only one
way to do that. Homosexuality, therefore, is irrational, biologically
speaking.
