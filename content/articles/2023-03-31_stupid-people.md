In the modern age, which in this context means the period following the
Second World War to the present, people have been conditioned to ignore
the stupid. If you notice them at all, it is to show your compassion.
You care about the stupid because you are a good person, not because you
want to do something about them. In this regard, we are taught to
confuse the stupid with the helpless.

This was not always so. For much of human history, the main task for the
people in charge was to limit the number of transactions by the stupid.
Every time a stupid person makes a decision, there is a chance for
mayhem. Therefore, the way to create a stable society is to reduce the
number of transactions made by the stupid. Controlling the stupid
population was a priority of government.

In times when the intelligent people were in short supply, bandits would
often be used by the intelligent to keep the stupid under control. In
wartime, when the intelligent are busy with war fighting, the bandits
could be used to make sure the stupid are limited to things that
minimize the damage they cause. The bandits profit, but that is a price
worth paying to keep the stupid under control.

It is why after a war, the intelligent people are often faced with a
bandit problem, as this class has grown rich as war profiteers. The
bandits have to be suppressed in order to then take control of the
stupid and restore peaceful order. The former task is always easier than
the latter, as bandits operate by the bandits logic. Stupid people, on
the other hand, follow no know pattern.

This is fine in a temporary crisis, but when the shortage of intelligent
people is long term, then the society is overrun first by bandits then
by the stupid. The present administration is a microcosm of this. The
geezers are mostly of the bandit class with strong stupid tendencies.
The younger members are just stupid. Our political class was first
overrun by bandits and now by the stupid.

The internet itself is a great example of this. In the early days, it
was the domain of intelligent people as you needed to be smart to get
on-line. Then the bandits with intelligent tendencies came along and
made it easier for the stupid to get on-line, which also made it easy
for the bandits that tend toward stupid. That is how we got social media
companies. Before long the internet was overrun by stupid people.

This is turning up all over now. The intelligent have declined in
numbers, but many have been pushed aside by bandits with intelligent
tendencies. These clever grifters have taken up positions in power all
over society. They bring with them the bandits that tend toward the
stupid and they do nothing to control the stupid. The result is an
explosion is stupid people doing stupid things that cause enormous harm.

The thing is, stupid people are a constant, in terms of their
percentages, so the controlling factor is always the smart fraction.
This is not just a matter of general intelligence, as there are high IQ
stupid people. The intelligent have to be aware of their responsibility
and have the means to control the stupid. If either is missing, the
smart fraction, no matter how large, is overwhelmed by the stupid.
