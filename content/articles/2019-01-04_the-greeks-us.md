I am back! I was never really gone, but the podcast took a week off over
the holidays, so the podcast is back. It is good to take a break, just
to recharge the batteries. This thing takes about six hours a week,
spread over the week, so there is more work to it than the blog. The
part that takes the most time is gathering ideas and assembling notes.
The recording is only about two hours. Still, it is not a full-time job,
but it takes time, so a little bit of a break from time to time is a
good idea.

One of my more popular podcasts was the one I did on the Romans.
Everyone likes to talk about Rome. There is something satisfying to the
comparisons between America and Rome. That is probably because the
Romans had a lot of interesting characters. The Romans were also around
a long time, so it feels like their history is the set of all possible
outcomes for people. With a little historical license, you can find an
example from their history to meet just about every need.

The Greeks are a bit different. I think it is because the West has so
much more respect for the Greeks than the Romans. Maybe it is the fact
the Greeks never conquered the world, like the Romans. Alexander
certainly did, but his empire did not outlive him, and the people
involved were not so dramatic. That said, there are a lot of interesting
lessons to be drawn from the history of ancient Greece. That is the
theme for the show this week. It will be a sampling of ancient Greek
history.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I have been
de-platformed by Spotify, because they feared I was poisoning the minds
of their Millennial customers.
