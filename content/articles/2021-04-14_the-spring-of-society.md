Montesquieu observed that different political systems have different
internal motivations, an engine that drives the people in it. He used
the term *principle* as the thing that gave the system energy. In
aristocratic systems it was the desire for honor that drove people to
act. In a republic it was virtue. Instead of serving a man who was the
manifestation of the state, the republican man served the institutions.
He respected the office, not necessarily the office holder.

The principle of liberal democracy appears to be morality. The language
of this age is drenched in moral claims. The mantra of the age is
diversity, inclusion and equity, which is shot through with sentiment.
How much diversity is a good thing? There is no limit, of course, as
diversity is a good in itself. Equity is a purely subjective term as it
means distributing resources based on the needs of the recipients. The
people who make that decision are those who are at the top of the moral
hierarchy.

In addition to echoing and updating sentiments from the beginning of
western racialism (liberté, égalité, fraternité), the point of these
sorts of slogans is to communicate civic piety between the speaker and
listener. Alone they are just echolalic babbling, but when spoken or
written for an audience, the speaker feels virtuous, as she assumes the
listener, upon hearing these code words, will see that the speaker is
pious. These terms are about signaling and confirming piety.

The problem with this is morality needs authority. In a theocracy, like
in Iran, this problem is solved with Islam. The mullahs are the
defenders and chief promotors of their form of Islam, so they sit atop
the moral hierarchy. They provide the limits on democracy and a scale
against which to measure piety. Similarly, Puritanism provided the moral
authority for the early settlers in what is now New England. They had
democratic societies, bound by Scripture.

Liberal democracy does not have or tolerate a belief outside the
fingertips of man, so it cannot rely on established religion for moral
authority. Instead, it relies upon the marketplace to provide that
authority. The will of the people is formalized in elections and the
marketplace. This is why the most powerful people work to make sure
their opinions seem to reflect popular will. Rigging an election or
faking a public opinion poll makes perfect sense when placed in the
framework of liberal democracy.

The god of the marketplace has always had one very serious flaw. If
Herodotus is to be trusted, the Persians were the first to notice this.
They saw the Greek marketplace as nothing more than brothers lying to
brothers. The seller misrepresented his products in the hope of fooling
the customer. The customer misrepresented his interest in the hope of
bargaining down the price. The spirit of the agora was deception, which
makes the god of the market a fickle liar.

We are seeing this playout with the Covid vaccine. A mass vaccination
campaign requires public trust. After all, letting someone put something
in your body that you do not understand is a leap of faith. In a high
trust society where the people believe the rulers have their best
interest in mind, this is not difficult. In a low trust society, the
rulers must search for external sources of authority. In the case of
Covid, they have paraded out hundreds of experts from medicine and
science.

The problem is those experts are products of the marketplace. They work
for pharmaceutical companies, the political system, research outfits
supported by the Chinese communist party and so on. These experts are
fully democratic men in that they are products of the marketplace. They
represent the interests of whoever is paying their salary at the moment,
not the interest of the people. We can no more trust them that we can
trust the salesman at a used car lot.

Because we are now fully democratized people, we are conditioned to
assume that everyone is a product of the marketplace. Their interest in
the truth is meaningless as the truth is what the market says at the
moment. They are either making the market or following the trends of the
market. In the case of Covid, everyone looks at the experts and wonders
whose interests they are representing. The moral authority of liberal
democracy turns out to be a cynicism without limit.

Something Montesquieu never mentioned, but that is relevant to this age,
is the relationship between the principle of the system and its
durability. John Adams famously said in a letter to John Taylor,
“Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes exhausts and murders
itself”. A republic, it seems, does not do much better. The one Adams
helped found was quickly dashed to pieces by his descendants. Monarchy
seems to be the most durable, having been with us since the start.

The reason for this is democracy has no room for religion, while
republicanism tries to contain religion within the civic institutions.
Aristocratic systems, even without religion, reflect the reality of the
human condition. They begin with the assumption that there is always
someone one charge. The question is how that is decided and blood turns
out to be the most predictable. There is no debating lineage. It is far
from perfect, but it seems to be the most stable of mankind’s political
systems.

Of course, just about any political system can work in a high trust,
competent society, which means a homogeneous society. Both of those
qualities are inversely proportional to diversity. Liberal democracy, as
we see, places diversity as its highest goal, which is why it eventually
murders itself. It burns the social capital built up by the preceding
system until that fuel is exhausted. It turns out that liberal democracy
is the sign that a people are finished and are ready to shuffle off into
the history books.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
