One of the reasons conservatives preach against identity politics is
they believe it contradicts republican virtue. In a republic, people are
supposed to be supremely loyal to the institutions of the republic. The
men that hold office are not what matters, but rather, the office
itself. You are supposed to respect the office, even if the man in the
office is not respectable. This is why preventing low character people
from holding office is important, as it diminishes the respect for the
office.

Identity politics, in the conservative formulation, is tribalism and
that means the tribe comes before everything else. A person who puts his
tribe ahead of all else will sacrifice the office he holds or the
political system itself, if it is good for his tribe. This is why
conservatives moan about identity politics. They think it is
un-American. They are not entirely wrong on this point. This is clear
with <a
href="https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/pollard-jews-will-always-have-dual-loyalty-and-should-consider-spying-for-israel-663285"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Jonathan Pollard case</a>. His
primary loyalty is to his people, so he spied for Israel.

For obvious reasons, conservatives will never use a case like this when
moaning about the dangers of identity politics. Instead, they direct
their anger at the white people who have been supporting them for
decades but getting ruined as a result. Alternatively, they will gently
chastise the Left for firing-up the blacks with fantastical claims about
supernatural racism. They are not directing their wrath at the blacks,
of course, but at the white people they say are responsible for it.

The Pollard case, however, is an excellent example of identity politics,
both the positive and negative manifestations. Pollard claims that “If
you’re outside Israel, then you live in a society in which you are
basically considered unreliable.” This is a version of, “if they are
going to call you a Nazi, you may as well be a Nazi.” In other words,
Pollard believes Jews have no choice but to be unreliable and subversive
in their hosts countries, because that is the role carved out for them.

This is a great example of negative identity. Pollard thinks all
diaspora Jews are defined in their opposition to their host population.
This means a big part of who they are is controlled by exogenous forces.
If they are in Asia, then their anti-Asian attitudes will come to define
them, but if they are in America, it is un-Americanisms. Pollard is
defining diaspora Judaism in the same way Woody Allen defined it in the
movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelig" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Zelig</a>, in which the main character was nothing more
than a chameleon.

On the other hand, Pollard points out that to be a Jew is to first and
foremost have a loyalty to the tribe and to Israel. In fact, it is this
loyalty to Israel that defines the Jew wherever he may find himself.
This is a positive identity. Loyalty to Israel and maintaining the
cultural habits of the Jewish people, no matter the environment, is what
defines the Jewish person. If all the non-Jews died tomorrow and there
were only Jews left on the planet, this would still control Jewish
identity.

This duality to identity points out something important. If all non-Jews
did die off, then that positive Jewish identity would quickly weaken.
After all, loyalty to Israel would not mean much when there is no longer
a threat to Israel or the Jewish people. Without some comparison and
competition, this identity would grow weak. As those familiar with the
Hebrew Bible know, the great threat to Israel was always internal. Those
secondary identities are what come to dominate in such a condition.

On the other side of the coin, a strong identity turns negative when the
group is surrounded by an alien identity. For example, Pollard’s casual
assumption that Jews must be seen as unreliable by host populations.
Therefore, being a good Jew means working to undermine the host
population. What he is suggesting, at least in the case of Jews, is that
being a minority population is unhealthy. A minority group with a strong
group identity will inevitably become self-destructive.

This duality of group identity is why Europe, despite massive efforts to
the contrary, maintains national identity. Net out the tens of millions
of alien immigrants and the majority of native people are strong
nationalist. The reason for this is Europeans are close enough to one
another to notice the differences. There is plenty of competition
between European people to maintain the group identity. It is why
immigration is important to the European project. It dilutes
nationalism.

In North America, identity in the form of nationalism never gained a
strong purpose until the 20th century and that was largely artificial.
What it means to be American was never a topic of conversation until the
20th century, because it never needed to be. Your local identity was
much more important. Even racial identity was never strong, because
blacks were small in number and never a real threat. This is why white
identity never developed in North America. Non-whites were never
competition.

All of this is quickly changing. The invasion from the south will
intensify nationalist identity in Europe to the point where whites
preaching against it will be laughed off the stage by white Europeans.
The weakening of the European consensus is clear when you look at what
is happening in ruling class politics. Here and there the view of
immigrants and their role in Europe is changing. Denmark and France are
two recent examples of where the consensus is starting to shift toward
nationalism.

In America, the white population is so beaten down by decades of
anti-white agitation that the recovery is much slower. Whites have been
conditioned to never take any side, especially their own, but that is
changing. The latent sense of identity is flowing into proxy issues like
populism and gun ownership. These issues lack an explicit white
identity, but they have a strong implicit one. They are white identity
with training wheels and in time these will become more explicitly white
issues.

The truth is like a body. No matter how well you try to hide it, it
eventually turns up, usually at an unexpected time. Ethnic and racial
identity are truths of the human condition, so they can never be
forgotten, no matter how well buried. That is the truth of the Pollard
case now floating to the surface. Identity is about trust. A people can
only trust their own people. As racial and ethnic distance grows, the
trust declines, which is why peaceful separation is the natural order of
mankind.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
