I mentioned the other day that Trump was exceedingly good at identifying
opportunities to shift the focus from himself onto others. Dreary
dullards in the GOP and their sycophants find this vexing, but it is
good politics. Progressives have sold bad ideas and bad candidates this
way for generations. Obama got the White House without anyone knowing
anything about him.

The interwebs brings word that <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">Trump has banned the Des Moines
Register</a> from his Iowa event.

*Donald Trump courted further controversy on Friday by banning the Des
Moines Register from attending his Iowa campaign event Saturday,
according to the <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">Register</a>.*

*The real-estate mogul and Republican 2016 candidate was unhappy with an
<a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">editorial</a> published by the newspaper
that called on Trump to pull out of the race.*

*“We’re not issuing credentials to anyone from The Des Moines Register
based on the editorial that they wrote earlier in the week,” Trump’s
campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told the newspaper.*

*He said he expected the campaign would reconsider for future events.*

Lewandowski is a hardline libertarian-conservative, who reminds a bit of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Atwater" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Lee Atwater</a>. The world is a different place these
days, but like Atwater, Lewandowski is good at getting under the skin of
establishment types. This has the benefit of shifting the focus from the
candidate onto his critics.

GOP voters loath the media so Trump scores points by zapping the media
this way. More important, it raises a discussion of the media’s bias and
honestly. There’s not a lot of time to mock Trump when the lead story is
how the Des Moines Register is not playing fair.

*The editorial section of the Register — Iowa’s largest newspaper —
operates independently from the newspaper’s political team.*

*“As we previously said, the editorial has no bearing on our news
coverage. We work hard to provide Iowans with coverage of all the
candidates when they spend time in Iowa, and this is obviously impeding
our ability to do so. We hope Mr. Trump’s campaign will revisit its
decision instead of making punitive decisions because we wrote something
critical of him,” the Register’s editor Amalie Nash said in a
statement.*

I’ve often wondered if the people working at these organizations believe
this stuff. Maybe they do, but no one outside the press believes it.
Even liberals admit that the main press is on their side. They just
claim it is because the void where God used to be wills it. The vast
majority of people think Amalie Nash of the register is full of it.
Worse yet, they think she knows she is full of it.
