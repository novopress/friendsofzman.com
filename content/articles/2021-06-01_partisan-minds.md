A fetish of the modern Right in America has been complaining about and
denouncing partisanship in Washington. In fairness, the Left will
indulge in this on the rare occasions when the Republicans do something
for their voters. Mostly it is a conservative fetish, as it is the Left
that drives the debate. The Right needs to maintain the fantasy that
republican virtue still matters, so they regularly complain about the
Left acting in their narrow interests, rather than in the interests of
the country.

In theory, the conservatives are correct. Partisanship is the great bane
of a republic, as it subverts the very basis of a republic. What is
necessary to maintain a republic is what Montesquieu called republican
virtue, the willingness to put the interests of the system ahead of
personal or factional interests. For example, you must respect the
office, even if you have no respect for the man holding the office. This
shows up in our military culture where you do not salute the person, you
salute the rank.

The trouble with the conservative approach is we have not lived in a
republic for a very long time, so they are playing make believe. We live
in a liberal democracy that is decreasing liberal with each turn of the
wheel. In democratic systems, the ends justify the means, so
partisanship dominates. It replaces republican virtue in favor of
subjective moral certainty. This is one of the reasons that conservatism
is worthless in a democracy of any sort. It prohibits victory as defined
by the rules.

A good example of how partisanship works is in
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwgHGRLPZQ4&amp;t=1200s"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">this conversation</a> on the Daily Wire
program, which is part of a series they run call *Backstage*. It is one
of those round table deals where the stars chat about issues of the day.
The highlighted clip is the discussion of Israel and their attacks on
the Arabs last week. The people behind the Daily Wire are
hyper-Zionists, so the conversation follows predictable contours. Israel
is heroically fighting attacks from those evil Arabs.

Matt Walsh tries to point out a true fact, which is that Americans do
not have a patriotic duty to support Israel or any other country.
Immediately, the rules of the show are suspended as Boreing, Shapiro and
Klavan leap to attack Walsh. It is an amusing bit of mask dropping,
given the title of the show. The rules of decorum stop mattering to the
partisan, as soon as his interests are in play. They cut off Walsh a few
times and make sure he cannot get his point across to the audience.

An example of how rules are meaningless to partisans is when Shapiro
claims that patriotism means love of ideas, while nationalism means love
of country. This is laughable nonsense, and he surely knows it, so it is
also a lie. The word patriotism comes from the Greek for “of one’s
fathers” or fatherland. Of course, nationalism means a devotion to one’s
own people. Both concepts have been attacked for obvious reasons, but
their etymology is never in dispute.

In other words, Shapiro does not feel bound by truth when it comes to
these topics, because what matters is his partisan interests. He wants
conservatives to think they are duty-bound to back Israel, so he feels
justified in making crazy claims like Americans have a patriotic duty to
blindly defend Israel. This is an instinct that exists in the lizard
brain, so he does not think of what he is doing as dishonest or immoral.
It is just what he does, like pulling his hand away from a hot item.

Another aspect of partisanship is on display with Andrew Klavan. In that
clip he makes the case for exterminating the Arabs. He does not put it
like that, but that is the implication of his argument. In his view, the
Arabs will never behave, and the Israelis are justified in using lethal
force. The logical leap from those two statements is that the final
solution to the problem is the liquidation of the Arabs. His excitement
at the thought of exterminating the Arabs is an insight into the
partisan mind.

Partisanship, like ethnocentrism, places group loyalty at the top. The
first thing the partisan does when encountering people or issues is
place them on one side of the partisan lines. “Is this person on our
side?” is always the first question. In the case of issues or events,
the question is, “how can this be turned to our advantage?” Since the
partisans swaps his own individual identity for that of the group, these
questions always feel deeply personal. They are life and death.

In a sense they are life and death. Since who Ben Shapiro is, from the
perspective of Ben Shapiro, is his membership in the Zionist subculture,
any questioning of it is a questioning of his very existence. It is why
Klavan starts to salivate at the thought of killing Arabs. He cannot see
them as human, as they are opposed to his group, so they are his mortal
enemies. One is always justified in using any means necessary when
defending your life from a threat.

You hear this in the left-wing justifications for violence over the last
year. When they say “silence is violence” they are not being cheeky. To
the partisan mind, you are either on their side or against their side.
Words and violence are the same to the partisan mind, as anything that
opposes the group is seen as a lethal threat. That is why silence is
viewed as violence, as not declaring your support means opposition and
the partisan is free to use any means necessary to end a threat.

There is not only no reasoning with a partisan, but there is no
appealing to their better nature or their sense of virtue. Their chief
virtue, the thing that matters the most to them, is their loyalty to the
cause. Everything is warped to fit that moral framework, even the very
definition of words, as you see with Ben Shapiro. Everything is viewed
as a tool that can either be used against opponents or can be used by
opponents. Facts and reason have no more resonance than clubs and guns.

This is why moral appeals against partisanship fail. It is like making
the claim that pork is healthy to a devout Muslim. He does not share
your morality, so your morals appeal sounds weird and offensive. Your
good intensions are proof of your bad intensions, which defeats the
point of making the moral appeal. The only counter to partisanship is
more extreme partisanship. Once that genie has been let out of the
bottle, the only way to put it back in the bottle is through any means
necessary.
