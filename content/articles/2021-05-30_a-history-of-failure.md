One of the enduring mysteries, one that is rarely explored, is why all
right-wing movements in America have failed to make a dent in
Progressivism. The first iteration of conservatism in America was washed
away by Progressive reformers in the first part of the 20th century.
When political crisis struck, conservatives had no political solutions,
just theoretical analysis. Progressives, meanwhile, had a program.

In response to the success of New Deal politics, the American Right
reorganized in the middle of the last century around more practical
items. Buckley-style conservatism was about winning elections and
implementing policy. Like its predecessor, it failed to do much to stem
the tide of Progressive innovation. In the end it was corrupted by the
system it sought to reform, becoming just another node on the managerial
state.

The reason for this long track record of futility is that American
conservatism has always been dominated by bourgeois objectivism. Unlike
Randian objectivism, bourgeois objectivism is the assumption that the
world runs by a set of immutable laws and that the point of politics is
to adapt to those laws. Discovering the right answer is the point of all
political activity as once the answer is clear, everything falls into
place.

In the realm of politics, it means that all political actors,
individually and in groups, are acting from rational and discoverable
motives. This naturally leads to a reductionist interpretation of
Progressive politics. Whatever the Left proposes is feverishly analyzed
by conservatives to discern “real motives”. Further, it is always
assumed that the Left is driven by the same desires as the Right would
be driven, if the roles were reversed.
