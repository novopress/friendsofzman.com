decided to dive back in the ancient Rome comparisons, which is always a
good time. Of course, there is content behind

A big part of the ongoing crisis in America is that both sides of the
political debate agree on one main point. The people are responsible for
the mess. Joseph de Maistre gave us the phrase, “Every country has the
government it deserves.” The American ruling elite has turned it into
their raison d’etre. Because they have nothing but contempt for the
people over whom they rule, they feel they have an obligation, a sacred
duty, to be every bit as contemptable as the they imagine their
subjects.

The general shabbiness of the current ruling class relative to those of
the past can be seen when looking at the oligarchs of the prior age.
Great technological advance brings great changes in economics. There are
winners and losers and some portion of the winners become something like
royalty. The industrial age gave America a class of super-rich who were
every bit as powerful as old world aristocracy. They controlled the
economy and finance, and thus the country.

These were the robber barons. The term itself actually comes from the
feudal age, when a class of knights would shake down travelers for
money. They would charge tolls for goods crossing through their lands,
even though they had no authority to do so, and the roads were intended
for public use. A robber baron was someone with status who maintained it
though unscrupulous practices. Surprisingly, it was the New York Times
that first used the term to describe modern industrialists.

The robber barons were accused of exploiting unethical monopolies over
natural resources like coal and oil. They maintained these monopolies by
bribing politicians and threatening those who challenged them. They
squashed their competition, which let them suppress wages. If that was
not enough, they operated financial scams on unsuspecting investors,
often by manipulating the markets through fraud. The robber barons were
high status crooks.

If that sounds familiar, it should. The oligarchs of the modern age make
the robber barons look like pikers in terms of wealth and immorality.
They are not hiring private armies like the Pinkertons to murder their
workers. Instead, they are unleashing waves of foreign peasants who
create mayhem in your community. They finance terrorist groups like
Antifa and BLM to attack white people. Of course, they have their
tentacles wrapped around the economy like a <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">kraken</a>.

When you look back at the men who were the oligarchs of the prior age,
they are not very different from the current crop of oligarchs. Look at
their biographies and they are familiar to a modern eye. Getting a
monopoly on oil, like Rockefeller, is no different from having a
monopoly on operating systems, like Bill Gates. James Fisk got rich
through stock fraud, which is no different from what we see from the
gangsters in the financial class today. We just have more of them.

There is one big area of departure in this comparison. The robber barons
of old had some sense of shame, which led them to take some of their
ill-gotten gains and put them back into society. Maybe it was just a way
to buy public approval or maybe it was a genuine sense of duty, but they
did underwrite things public works projects, colleges, and museums. In
fact, most of the remaining culture we have that is worth the name was
paid for by the robber barons of the industrial age.

The current robber barons appear to have no shame. Instead of using
their money to build cultural monuments they are trying to blot out the
sun. That is right, Bill Gate is using his wealth on a plan [to block
the sun](https://www.entrepreneur.com/amphtml/367869). Feudal man got
great cathedrals from his rulers, while industrial man got great
museums. Technological man is getting crackpot schemes to plunge the
world into permanent winter. By comparison, our oligarchs are super
villains compared to those of past ages.

This is not just a one-off example. Gates is fairly typical of the
modern robber baron, in that he seems to have a fetish for schemes that
cause more harm than good. He poured money into African relief programs
that were doomed from the start. He has bankrolled education schemes
that make a mockery of what we know about how to train up the young
generation. He has been making an ass of himself on the Covid issue,
spouting one kooky idea after another.

Part of this, of course, is the modern moral framework. The robber
barons of the prior age were working within the Christian moral
framework. They may not have been believers, but the public was still
Christian. If they wanted to be seen as pious men, they had to commit
public acts of piety. Modern man is far more primitive in his beliefs,
so pleasing the earth goddess or fighting evil spirits is the way to
salvation. Even the hacks in the political system [get in on the
act](https://www.mass.gov/news/governor-baker-signs-climate-legislation-to-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions-protect-environmental-justice-communities).

Perhaps de Maistre was right. The people in the prior age would have had
the good sense to hang someone promising to blot out the sun. If a
governor stood in front of a pothole filled road blaming in on the gods,
he would have been tared and feathered as a lunatic, if not a
blasphemer. Today, out best and brightest indulge in the onanistic
religion of climate change with the same fervor as the loons promising
us they can control the sun. We have the rich people we deserve.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
