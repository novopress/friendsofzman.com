An indication that Christianity has declined over the last decades is
the fact that Easter has slowly faded from the public space. It used to
be that stores would have sales for the things that go along with
holiday. The grocery stores would have an aisle dedicated to candy and
treats popular with Easter. You would see ads for children’s clothes, as
Easter was typically a time to get the little ones new gear.

The main reason for the decline in Easter, of course, is the decline in
the number of people attending Christian churches. In some parts of the
country, like New England, church attendance has collapsed. In those
states, about half the people never attend services, while only about a
quarter attend regularly. Only a few states have a majority of people
attending church regularly.

Of course, the churches have succumbed to the rot. The Episcopal church
is mostly about sodomy now. Drive around the east coast and it seems
like every rainbow ends at an Episcopal church. The Catholic church is
in steep decline due to the homosexual priest scandals. Even the
Baptists have decided that it is better to please the lunatics than tend
to the faithful. The result is a lot of empty pews.

There is also the fact that Christianity is strongly associated with the
Western tradition and that means it is viewed as white by the
antiwhites. Since all things white are now on the proscribed list, the
people making beer ads featuring crossdressers are not going to be
making ads for Christian holidays. Just as white men have been scrubbed
from your television, positive views of Christianity have been scrubbed.

On the other hand, there is a revival in what can best be called
Christianism or maybe ad hoc Christianity. These are the people saying,
“Christ is king!” in the political context and the people rallying to
what they call Christian Nationalism. Calling this Christianity feels
like a stretch as it has little in the way of theological underpinnings,
but it suggests a strong desire to adopt or create such an underpinning.

Like so much in the West, Christianity is due for both a revolution and
revival in the face of the assault on Western culture. The churches are
probably too far gone to participate in such a revival, but new churches
have grown up in the past. Protestantism exists for this exact reason.
In fact, America exists largely due to the renewal process within
Western Christianity that kicked off in the Reformation.

That is the show this week. This is fertile ground for dissidents as
there are a lot of dissident Christians going through the same awakening
as secular dissidents, so there is a lot of overlap. That and being a
dissident is as much about reclaiming the past from the cultural vandals
and that means reclaiming Christianity. There simply cannot be a West
without the Christian churches and Christianity.
