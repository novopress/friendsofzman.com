I said after the last election that there are a dwindling number of ways
for disaffected whites to participate in conventional politics. All of
them are disruptive. For example, whites can boycott elections,
especially targeting Republicans. Elections are about legitimacy and
boycotts attack the legitimacy of the election. In a world of outlandish
election fraud, the boycott is a useful tool. Even the most craven
despots want to believe they have the support of the people.

We may be seeing something like this evolve with Biden. His big speech,
which was hyped by both sides of the uniparty, drew 11 million viewers.
The YouTube livestream was mostly people taking the time to down vote
the feed. YouTube started deleting the down votes, but the ratio was
still awful. This was supposed to be The Pretender’s big moment and
people either tuned out or mocked it. In the technological age, that is
the equivalent of a boycott. It was a virtual boycott.

Of course, apathy is also an explanation. Joe Biden has always been a
stupid gasbag, the kind of guy who people avoid at parties. Now he is a
doddering old fool with scrambled eggs for brains. Most people are
embarrassed to see this ridiculous man performing even more ridiculous
spectacles. White people tend not to enjoy seeing someone humiliate
themselves. *Fremdschamen* is a real thing. It is possible the lack of
interest is driven by a sense of shame.

Even so, the total lack of interest in Biden must be worrisome. There
are two clear pillars of the current regime. One is they are defending
democracy from insurrectionist white supremacists. This myth is so
important to them they even made Biden compare January 6 to the Civil
War. The other is that Biden is the great unifier of the people, a
modern day Lincoln. Not all of the people. Like Lincoln, Biden would
like to murder half the white people, but he is still wildly popular.

This summer the regime will try to stage some fake patriotic protests in
Washington to keep the insurrectionist pillar standing. Those Trump
rallies this summer will be cast as Nazi party rallies or perhaps the
new Klan rally. That will be enough to keep the regime thinking they are
in a great struggle with evil. It is remarkable how guys like Trump,
despite the rhetoric, end up being tools of the system. The regime needs
Trump and right on cue he is going to be there for them.

They cannot fake the lack of interest in Mumbly Joe. They clearly asked
YouTube to rig their system to make Biden look popular. The media will
keep telling us that Biden is the most admired man on earth. It is
really hard to fake popularity and efforts to do usually backfire on the
regime. There is always the risk of a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqF4pUumWpw" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Ceaușescu moment</a>. Given the problems in the economy
and the ongoing unrest, it is hard to see how they maintain this pillar
of the regime. People just do not like Biden very much.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
