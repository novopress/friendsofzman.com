**07:00:** The commenting software was updated last night. Of course,
they willy-nilly changed things in a way I donâ€™t like. I know about the
color schemes, which are stupid, but I have to dig around to find where
to fix them. if anyone has other issues, post them here.

**10:30:** Setup reCaptcha. That should be working now. The appearance
will take some time, as I think I need to edit the CSS itself. I think
it should be high contrast, so a white background with heavy black text.

**11:00:** Okay, I removed the reCaptcha for now. The stock version is
terrible. The spam filter should be enough for now.
