Way back when the government kicked off the Covid panic, smart people
pointing out that shutting down the world to bend the curve was not a
cost free way of addressing the problem. In fact, it was a very
expensive and risky solution to a problem that was best addressed
through traditional means. The world has a pandemic every 15 years and a
severe one at least once a generation. Humans have figured out to tough
out these naturally occurring events.

Shutting down the world and making people stay home from work is a novel
invention, so there was no way to know what would happen. Human
societies are tough, so it took a while for the problems to manifest.
Initially, those who could work from home worked from home and those
unemployed were supported with subsidies. This could never be a
permanent condition, so we have been trying to transition back to
normalcy for the last six months, but things are nowhere near normal.

The Brits have gasoline shortages, and they are facing a winter with
spiraling natural gas prices, because the energy supply chain is a mess.
Keeping people at home meant keeping people out of their cars, which
collapsed fuel consumption. The trucks and truck drivers were put to
other uses and now that demand is returning, they suddenly have a
shortage of trucks and truck drivers. This will soon hit other parts of
the supply chain as demand suddenly increases for goods and services.

In the US, ports are a mess as they face similar supply chain problems.
The ports in America are weird systems. The labor is unionized, but the
unions are pretty much run by the government under an array of consent
decrees. Demand for labor is driven by the ships in port needing to be
loaded and unloaded. The stevedoring firms hire when they need to unload
a ship, but they keep few fulltime people. They simply draw from the
pool of longshoremen that operate at the port.

During the shutdowns, fewer ships came into port, so fewer people were
needed to unload ships and fewer trucks were needed to cart the goods
out of the port. That is why ships are stacked up at the ports now. The
system for unloading those ships had atrophied during the pandemic, so
it is now over-capacity. This leads to shortages and price disruptions
throughout the economy. For example, America has been suffering an
aluminum shortage for close to a year.

A good example of how throwing wrenches into the system has
unpredictable long term effects is the automobile industry. When the
government shut down the country, the travel industry was flattened. The
car rental firms did the prudent thing. They liquidated their car
fleets. After all, if you make your money renting cars and no one is
renting cars, those cars are direct hits to the bottom line. In order to
weather the storm, they sold off their fleets and furloughed their
staff.

The trouble is a big source of used cars is the car rental industry.
They get cars on programs from the manufacturers. They can be three, six
or nine month programs where the company takes the new cars for a
monthly fee and then returns them to the manufacturers after the term of
the program. Those cars end up in the new car dealer lots as discounted
used cars. Look around the car lots in America and what you see is lots
of empty spaces where cars used to sit.

Once things opened up, the car rental companies went looking for cars,
so they went to the used car auctions. Other shortages have made it
impossible for the manufacturers to get cars to their own dealers, much
less supply program cars to the rental fleets, so that left the used car
market. Used car prices are now spiking to record levels because the
supply chain is a mess. It will take years for this to normalize, and
the cost will be in the tens of billions.

Of course, everyone who buys food has noticed that food is suddenly much
more expensive and there are weird shortages. Like everything else, the
broken supply chain is the main culprit. Those trucking companies
suddenly put out of business by government fiat did not sit around
waiting to open up again. They fired their staff, sold off their trucks
and found other ways to survive. Rebuilding the many small links of the
supply chain will take years and show up in higher food prices.

In a modern liberal democracy, every event requires a response, and
every response requires a response and so on. The smallest pebble tossed
into the water can potentially result in a flood. In this context it
means government jumping in to mitigate the consequences of their fix
for something else they broke. Inflation will get calls for more
spending, which will get more inflation. The central banks will then try
to redirect that inflation from goods to assets.

In other words, the shutdowns have created a dynamic of chaos that will
take years to settle out, assuming no further shocks. The Biden
administration is promising another meteor strike with their Build Back
Better nonsense. You see, they broke everything and now see it as a
chance to remake the world in their image. When crazy stupid people want
to try to make the world, the only thing that can follow is chaos. We
may be at the cusp of an age of unimaginable economic madness.

This is a good example of something said by Will Durant. “Out of every
hundred new ideas ninety-nine or more will probably be inferior to the
traditional responses which they propose to replace. No one man, however
brilliant or well-informed, can come in one lifetime to such fullness of
understanding as to safely judge and dismiss the customs or institutions
of his society, for those are the wisdom of generations after centuries
of experiment in the laboratory of history.”

In the fullness of time, after the West is a ruin of its own making,
this age will be remembered as a gross and sustained violation of that
sentiment. If over the last thirty years the people in charge had done
nothing but entertain themselves with their toys, none of this would be
happening. Instead, they kept trying to prove nature wrong and overturn
the wisdom of ages. Reality does not take kindly to this amount of
abuse, so there will be consequences.
