The descendents of Puritan Yankees are bound together over one thing and
that’s a deep hatred of the South. They used to hate the South because
it represented the Royalist side of English life. Once the North was
able to destroy the South and Royalist culture, things calmed down for a
while. But, the fevered lunacy of the North was revived with the
importation of new crackpot ideas from the Continent and the Cult of
Modern Liberalism was born. Soon thereafter they went to war with the
South again.

rel="noopener" target="_blank">This just in from old friend Lois
Lerner</a>:

*Lois Lerner, the central figure in the IRS targeting controversy,
called Abraham Lincoln the country’s worst president in an email
disclosed in a bipartisan Senate report, according to [USA
Today](http://onpolitics.usatoday.com/2015/08/05/senate-report-lois-lerner-also-targeted-bristol-palin/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&dlvrit=206567).*

*“Look my view is that Lincoln was our worst president not our best,”
Lerner wrote in an email dated March 6, 2014.Lerner, the former IRS
director of Exempted Organizations, joked in one email that the 16th
president should have just let the South secede, rather than fighting
the Civil War.*

*“He should \[have\] let the south go,” Lerner wrote in response to a
friend who disparaged Texas as a “pathetic” state. “We really do seem to
have \[two\] different mind sets.”*

*The report also highlighted emails written by Lerner calling
conservatives “crazies” and “a–holes.”*

As I keep saying, the cultural heirs of those Yankee Puritans are not
acting from facts and reason. They look at the rest of the country,
particularly the South, as sub-human. In the 18th century they saw the
South as an affront to God. In the 19th century they saw the South as a
threat to God’s creation. They’ve dropped the references to God in the
20th, so the South became an obstacle to the Progressive paradise.

It should come as no surprise that Lerner is from Massachusetts, the
epicenter of liberal lunacy. Her husband appears to be from Eastern
Ohio, which was settled by Puritan lunatics after the Revolution.
Another one of my themes is that belief is heritable and therefore
fanaticism is as well. A whole lot of commies were the children of
religious Jews for a reason. The believing gene is strong in the Tribe.
