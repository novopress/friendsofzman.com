One of the underappreciated qualities of liberal democracy is its
ability to grow and develop its own opposition. In the Cold War this was
not obvious as communism in the form of the Soviet Empire filled the
role. Domestically, the inner party had the outer party as a fixed
partner. Democrats controlled domestic policy, with some mild opposition
from the Republicans. On the other hand, the Republicans controlled
foreign policy with some mild dissent from the Democrats.

This partnership collapsed when the Soviet Union collapsed. A year after
the voters overwhelmingly approved the appointment of former C.I.A. man
George H. W. Bush as the successor to Ronald Reagan, the logic of having
spooks run the country no longer made much sense. The system quickly
pivoted to Saddam Hussein as a temporary fill in for the evil empire,
but he was a poor replacement. In the next election the Cold War
generation was replaced with the Woodstock generation.

The Clinton years were really just an interregnum. The system needed to
learn how to create new enemies. We got the beginnings of the great
Islamic enemy and an effort to recreate the holocaust in the Balkans. It
was not until the son of the former C.I.A. man that we got the threat of
international Islam as the new enemy. Fear of men on flying carpets
carried the system into the Obama years. Toward the end of his second
term, the search for a new enemy had started.

In this respect, the Trump election can be seen as a natural
development. The system needed a bogey man and Trump was prepared to
play the role. His appeal to the masses of Dirt People properly
frightened the Cloud People and his reckless use of language made him
easy to isolate and demonize. The new enemy of the regime would be white
supremacist insurrectionists. That is the reason the regime compares
January 6th to September 11th. It is their new origin story.

That is one way to look at what has been happening over the last 30
years. It is the quest for authenticity. This vast sprawling managerial
state needs a reason to exist, so these manufactured crises provide it.
Through the Cold War, the Berlin Wall was both a physical and temporal
starting point for the regime. It is why presidents would go to the
Brandenburg Gate and give speeches. The great twilight struggle against
communism was the reason the regime existed and why it persisted.

The crusade against the Mohammedans was the first full attempt to
recreate that old magic and provide the regime with legitimacy and
authority. It is why 9/11 became a solemn holiday celebrated by both
sides of the regime. Even though the left-liberals opposed the
right-liberals in the prosecution of the crusade, they completely
accepted the origin of it and the centrality of it. Note that the last
anniversary of 9/11 came and went without much ceremony. It no longer
matters.

On the other hand, we will now have two new holidays for this new
crusade being used to authenticate the regime. Juneteenth will now be
the new [Independence
Day](https://americanmind.org/salvo/independence-day-replaced/) and
January 6th will be the Passover. The former is in commemoration of when
the good news reached the last of the magic people. The latter is when
the tides of history protected the faithful from the raging mobs of
systemic racism. Perhaps this will be published as the Gospel of Saint
Jaffa, a new holy book.

This new enemy the system has created for itself is more natural and
compelling for the regime, so it will be more durable that the crusade
against Islam. That drama raised questions about certain subjects that
no one is allowed to discuss. It also had religious overtones, which
invited in Christians. The only thing that makes the regime more
uncomfortable than Christians openly talking about their religion is a
collection of white guys noticing they are the only ones without an
identity group.

The other compelling aspect of the new war on white people is that it
has a historical and anthropological appeal to the regime. One side has
been defined by its opposition to bad whites since Charles I. The other
side has been similarly defined since Emperor Titus sacked Jerusalem.
The new enemy of the regime both inspires and unites the regime in a new
end times struggle to make manifest the words of the Declaration of
Independence and the Gettysburg Address.

What this suggests, of course, is that this jihad against white people
we see raging everywhere is not going to go away quickly. All events
will be warped to fit into the new world view of the struggle. Foreign
adversaries will be cast as agents of white supremacy or enablers of
white insurrectionists. Regime members who need to be purged will be
painted as collaborators at their show trials. January 6th will be their
Yom Kippur and every June 16th their Purim.

Whether or not this can work is a question no one dares ask. History has
not been kind to regimes that are defined by their war with their own
people. A multiracial regime at war with half the people on racial
grounds is inherently unstable, as it creates both the means and the
motivation to destroy the regime. If one half of the country is defined
by its opposition to the regime and the other half is too dysfunctional
and inept to defend the regime, the outcome is not hard to imagine.

History gives us a story arch for various forms of social organization.
The old palace systems of the Bronze Age do not scale up. Empires all
succumbed to internal contradictions and imbalance. Aristocratic systems
eventually run out of able elites to maintain the system. Communism
finally runs out of seed corn. It could be that the final phase of
liberal democracy is a final war against itself. Born in sin and
animated by a search for salvation, it sacrifices itself as its final
act.
