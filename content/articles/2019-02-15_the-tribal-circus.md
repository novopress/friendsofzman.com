Like a lot of people, I am struggling to remain positive this week,
after Trump once again blundered into making things worse on the
immigration front. I think it is fair to wonder if he was not a
Manchurian candidate all along. Hired by the usual suspects to pose as a
populist, he was supposed to discredit anti-immigration arguments in the
primary by presenting them poorly. Instead, voters were willing to look
past his ham-fisted presentation, in order to make one last effort to
avoid tipping into the abyss.

Now in office, the usual suspects have flipped some other switches in
his programming so that he engineers these colossal legislative defeats.
That is a joke, I think, but you have to wonder what Trump would do
different if he was actually trying to sabotage his own presidency. He
is now everything we expected from Jeb Bush, except for two judges that
may be OK. I guess you can call the new NAFTA a win, but that is not the
great departure from the prior regime that Trump has claimed. It is more
tinkering than repeal.

Still, it is easy to gobble black pills, but that is not very useful.
Trump was never the solution to the problems facing us. At best he was
just going to be a wrecker, who discredited the prevailing political
orthodoxy, so we should always set our expectations accordingly. It is
also important to remember that the orthodoxy is not just the civic
nationalist face we tend to see. The creature behind that Republican
mask is the Progressive side of the orthodoxy, which is the Grendel in
our saga.

That is the focus on this week’s show. In order to keep it light, I am
taking a long look at the Democrat primary that is shaping up. We forget
that the party actually wielding power, regardless of who is in office,
is the Democrat party. They set the agenda, and they control the
Republican Party. The health of the Democrats is a good indication of
just how effective the current vaccines are to the poz they are trying
to spread. This podcast is a rundown of the Democrat tribes and the
characters vying to be the new chief.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I have been
de-platformed by Spotify, because they feared I was poisoning the minds
of their Millennial customers.
