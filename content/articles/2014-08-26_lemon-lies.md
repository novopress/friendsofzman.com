If you’re a gun nut, you probably know about the <a
href="http://bearingarms.com/cnns-don-lemon-thinks-anyone-can-buy-machine-gun-video/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Don Lemon flap over his
preposterous claims about buying machine guns in Colorado</a>. The
striking thing about gun grabbers is how little they know about guns,
gun laws and gun statistics. It’s just another example of how America is
a foreign country to the typical media member. It’s why these stories
get so much traction with gun owners. The lies are intended to dismiss
gun owners as cranks, but reveal the media to be ignoramuses.

Charles Cooke <a
href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/386243/why-don-lemons-mistake-matters-charles-c-w-cooke"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has been all over it</a>. Like
a lot of Europeans who move here, Cooke has become a gun nut. It’s not
that other countries restrict firearms so much as they don’t have a gun
culture. Americans like shooting guns. You just don’t run into that in
other parts of the world. American take dates to the gun range. Mr.
Cooke has embraced that part of his new country with gusto.

The question is if there’s any proof Lemon ever bought a gun. It is a
huge pain to buy a gun in another state. Most states have laws against
transferring firearms to non-residents. The FFL dealer will work with
another dealer in your home state, but the home state controls the
purchase. That way, they can make sure you’re not dodging local laws.
You can buy from a private seller, but that’s not the claim here.

You can go to the NRA-ILA site to see the
<a href="http://www.nraila.org/gun-laws/state-laws/colorado.aspx"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">local laws in Colorado</a>. It
seems that Colorado is like any other state. They would have forced
Lemon to go through a local FFL in his home state to complete the
transfer. Theh there is his confusion over full auto versus semi-auto.
How do you not know that after having bought an AR-15?

Don Lemon is probably lying about all of it. He would not be the first
nitwit from the media to get caught like this. These people know so
little about firearms and firearms laws, they don’t know how ridiculous
their lies sound to people who do know the facts about guns. It is like
the guys who lie about their military service. The whopper works only if
you know nothing about the military.
