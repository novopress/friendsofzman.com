One of the looming problems facing the country is the number of
psychotic loons on the bench. These are fanatics who spent their lives
trying to get on the bench so they could spend the remainder of their
lives inflicting damage on the culture.

John Sununu talks about this in his recent book with regards to Judge
Souter, who became a raging nutter once he got on the Supreme Court.
We’re seeing it with John Roberts who should probably be removed for
psychological reasons. His increasingly deranged opinions strongly
suggest he is suffering from mental illness.

An example down stream is <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">Richard Berman who is tormenting Dinesh
D’Souza</a> right now.

*At a hearing Monday in Manhattan in which he [ruled filmmaker Dinesh
D’Souza must continue community service for four more
years](http://www.wnd.com/2015/07/judge-rules-again-on-dinesh-dsouzas-future/),
U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman said he considers D’Souza’s
violation of federal campaign-finance laws to be evidence of a
psychological problem and ordered further counseling.*

*D’Souza’s defense counsel Benjamin Brafman provided evidence to the
court that the psychiatrist D’Souza was ordered to see found no
indication of depression or reason for medication. In addition, the
psychologist D’Souza subsequently consulted provided a written statement
concluding there was no need to continue the consultation, because
D’Souza was psychologically normal and well adjusted.*

*But Judge Berman, who was appointed by Bill Clinton, disagreed,
effectively overruling the judgment of the two licensed psychological
counselors the U.S. probation department had approved as part of
D’Souza’s criminal sentence.*

*“I only insisted on psychological counseling as part of Mr. D’Souza’s
sentence because I wanted to be helpful,” the judge explained. “I am
requiring Mr. D’Souza to see a new psychological counselor and to
continue the weekly psychological consultation not as part of his
punishment or to be retributive.*

It’s tempting to recall that the Soviets liked sending dissenters off to
an asylum so that way they could not only claim the person was nuts, but
that saying what he said was nuts. Maybe that’s all there is here and
Judge Berman is just an fascist hot head. It’s also possible that he has
slipped a gear and this erratic behavior is a sign of a mental health
problem.

His words about trying to help someone who clearly is in no need of help
are just plain weird. Normal, well balanced people don’t talk like that
in a professional setting. It’s possible he is trying to couch is malign
intent to make a political enemy suffer in therapeutic terms, but
that’s  worse. Having sadists on the court is not something a free
people can tolerate either.
