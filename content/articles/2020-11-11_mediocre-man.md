**Notes:** I have <a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/posts/217628"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a new post</a> up behind the
green door. This time it is deep thoughts upon viewing the movie
Timecop. Well, not exactly deep thoughts. Just some thoughts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When trying to understand what has gone so terribly wrong with the
Occident, observers often point to intelligence as the main driver. The
populations of the West are getting dumber, so they are less capable
than in the past. This is not to say there are no geniuses today or that
there are fewer of them. It’s that their proportion of society is
smaller than in the past. It is the
<a href="http://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/sft.htm"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">smart fraction</a> that is
getting smaller. As a result, the progress of the West has slowed and
may be in reverse.

The typical way this is explained is this way. Imagine a man dragging a
sack of rocks down a road. If he is a large man and the sack has only a
few rocks, he can drag the sack as fast as he could walk without it. If
on the other hand, he is a small man and the sack has many rocks, he
will move much smaller than his capacity. This will show up most
prominently when his path is not clear. He may even come to a halt when
he comes to a hill or a long incline.

Now, one reason for this decline in intelligence, is the mass invasion
from outside the Occident over the last fifty years. Minneapolis is now
a dysfunctional city because of the importation of sub-Saharan Africans.
The sorts of people who think Ilhan Omar is a great leader will struggle
with modernity. The reason these people are trapped in the Neolithic age
is they lack the cognitive ability to go much further. California looks
like Mexico because it is now full of Mexicans.

Another reason, and most likely the reason for the mass invasion from
over the horizon, is white people are getting dumber. A quick look at
what average students did in school a century ago makes that clear. Most
college freshman would flunk
<a href="https://bullittcountyhistory.org/bchistory/schoolexam1912.html"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this eighth grade exam</a> or
be so offended by it they would need counseling. Ed Dutton has written
<a
href="https://www.amazon.com/At-Our-Wits-End-Intelligent/dp/184540985X"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a book</a> on this issue and
continues to do
<a href="https://youtu.be/kokKSIq5Z0g" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">videos</a> explaining the topic. The short version is
that white people have been in decline for a long time.

There is another aspect to this that does not get mentioned. That is,
the smart fraction in the West may not have changed that much, but the
middle fraction has grown rapidly over the last century. Better
nutrition and education have swelled the ranks of the mediocre, changing
the nature of our societies. Men who used to be supervisors on job sites
now run offices. Women who volunteered in the community and kept a good
house now run the nation’s human resource departments.

In other words, that man dragging the sack has not changed much. He is
not as big and fit as before, but he is pretty close. His sack is larger
and heavier, but he also has modern tools to mitigate much of it. He’s
not moving anywhere near as fast as he could, but it is not the burden
in the sack. It is the regulatory burden he must navigate to even pick
up the sack. Around the superior man is an army of mediocrities with a
myriad of rules and regulations governing the dragging of sacks.

Everywhere you go in the West, you are confronted with rules and
regulations that make little sense at face value. Every business has to
have people who spend their days keeping up with the rules, which change
constantly. The “compliance officer” has taken the role of the
ideological enforcer. Instead of making sure everyone is properly
enthusiastic for the latest truth from the party, the compliance officer
makes sure everyone is enthusiastic about following the rules.

These rules, of course, are the domain of the mediocre. Now, don’t
confuse mediocre with average. Average people know they are average and
accept their limitations, while the mediocrity imagines himself as an
elite. Every “policy expert” in Washington is sure he knows more about
his subject than the people who actually do the work. Every lawyer
thinks he is Blackstone. Every politician thinks he is a great
historical figure. The mediocrity does not know what he does not know.

This is the reason mediocrities love complex rules. The Mediocre Man
loves rules for the same reason small children love large bulky toys.
Just as the child lacks the fine dexterity and spatial awareness to
manipulate small objects, Mediocre Man lacks the cognitive ability to
act independently. He is a man who grasps the rail when going down a few
steps, because that’s what you do. His mastery of the rules is proof
that he is the smartest man in the room.

This is why the West is so burdened with elaborate and complicated rules
that have no obvious point. It’s why Massachusetts now has a curfew to
fight Covid. It’s not just that they think Covid is a night stalker, but
that an army of mediocre men came up with a plausible sounding, but
ultimately absurd, reason for the curfew. The mediocre men in politics,
being mediocrities themselves, embraced it for the same reason a toddler
picks up the big toy. It’s what makes sense to them.

Mediocre Man and his love of rulemaking is why we have a war on reason
and observation in the West. Mediocre Man sees the rules against reading
<a
href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-43"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Table 43</a> of the Unified
Crime Report and assumes anyone mentioning its contents broke the rules,
which the worst possible crime. There are rules about what you can say
about Covid, peace be upon him, so
<a href="https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1317781548901363712"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">anyone not in full
compliance</a>, even if he is right, must be hounded out of polite
society. The rules demand it.

None of this is to say that the mass invasion of stupid people and the
decline of native intelligence are not factors. In fact, the domination
of Mediocre Man may be another result of the Occidental decline. For the
same reason we have allowed millions of barbarians to enter our lands,
we have allowed Mediocre Man to take the controls of society and drive
us into a jungle of rules. It is why Mediocre Man has locked himself in
place by a form of regulatory capture.

Just as regulatory agencies are dominated by the industries or interests
they are allegedly regulating, Western societies have been captured by
those rule loving mediocrities they should be controlling. The smart
fraction, like those in the
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51233/51233-h/51233-h.htm"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">classic science fiction
story</a>, find themselves the slaves of stupid people who think they
are the masters of the universe. The problem in the West is that it has
been taken over by Raskolnikov, who thinks he is Petrovich.
