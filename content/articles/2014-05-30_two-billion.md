rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This report</a> from the Los
Angeles Times is being waved around by the usual suspects like they just
learned they hit the lottery. It is a bit puzzling, given that Sterling
just pocketed billions from the deal. It may simply be that they hate
him so much that he is no longer a real person, but a symbol for them.
Getting $2 Billion for an asset you bought for $12.5 Million does not
sound like harm to most people. If he had plopped that money into the
stock market, he’d have about $100 million right now.

This is not about money. This is about black identity politics. The NBA
is the black America pastime. Whites watch basketball, but nothing like
blacks. All the players are black, most of the coaches are black, the
reporters are black and the front offices and agents are mostly Jewish,
but that is changing. Hip-hop stars are getting into the agent business
for that reason. The AAU runners and street agents are all black.
Basketball in America is pretty much all black with a small number of
Jews.

The banishment of Sterling is about black pride more than anything else.
The fact that blacks can force a billionaire “white” guy out of the
league puts an exclamation point on what they have been saying for
years. It’s their league and they set the rules. The gloating over the
amount is that it confirms the league is a highly valuable property,
like the white sports. The Dodgers just sold for $2 Billion and now we
have a second tier NBA franchise fetching the same money.

Of course, idiocy is always a good starting point. Basketball teams are
not as valuable as football and baseball teams. There are a number of
reasons for it, but the big reason is the league is so poorly run. Maybe
that’s fixable. On the other hand, a sport narrowly focused on 13% of
the population has a clear ceiling. On the other other hand, business
continue to chase the homosexual trade, despite that being 2% of the
market. Anyone who says people are rational is not paying attention.
