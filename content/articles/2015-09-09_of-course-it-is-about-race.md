In one of my more popular posts, I made the rather obvious point that
black people are the most bigoted people in America. I did not mention
it at the time, but I don’t think you can really blame them. It’s only
prudent for a distinct racial minority to be paranoid about the
majority. That’s inevitably going to sound like bigotry, but racial
solidarity is never going to sound sunny and open.

The upside of this is black people in America tend to say what everyone
thinks but is too afraid to admit. <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">This story about the never ending Tom
Brady drama</a> is a good example.

*Brandon Marshall isn’t afraid to speak his mind, and that was on full
display on Tuesday night.*

*Discussing the nullification of Tom Brady’s four-game suspension
on Showtime’s “Inside the NFL,” the Jets’ wide receiver theorized
about how race might have played a role in Judge Richard M. Berman’s
decision.*

*“White players, specifically at the quarterback position, are treated
differently,” the five-time Pro Bowler said.*

*Marshall told host Adam Schein that many black players feel that they
are held to different standards than their white counterparts.*

*“Absolutely,” Marshall said. “At times, at times, at times, yes.”*

*The 31-year-old stressed that he’s not alone in this thinking. Rather,
it’s a widespread belief around the league.*

*“I think that the important role that I play on this show is to give
the viewers (an) inside look of the locker room,” Marshall said. “I am a
player right now. This is not just from our locker room; this is from
the locker rooms across the States. This is how guys are feeling. This
is not just my opinion. These are conversations I’m having with guys.*

*“It’s just not African-American players. I’ve had this conversation
with Caucasian players as well. The most important part of this whole
discussion is the process for the players. They just want the process to
be fair and right. They just want to get it right.”*

Brandon Marshall is not terribly bright so we should not expect deep
insights from him. But, he is not so dim to not notice that race has
played a role in this ridiculous story. Black players are arrested all
the time and that means the league is handing down punishments to black
guys all the time. Look at <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">the league’s police blotter</a> and you
see nothing but brothers.

When a white guy gets jammed up, the league has to consider the race
issue and throw the book at the honky. It’s simply prudent. Otherwise,
you end up with Soros funded mob outside your door, threatening to burn
your league down. It’s the cost of handing deviant weirdos and bitter
freaks a veto over public morality. In 21st century America, black
people are sacred so you tread lightly around anything remotely
connected to race.
