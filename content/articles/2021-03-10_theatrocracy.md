Religion in a liberal democracy is a funny thing, in that most everyone
is sure they understand what it is, but few people recognize it all
around them. The people who think of themselves as religious in the
conventional sense think they live in a fallen world where most have
abandoned their faith. On the other hand, those who are sure they have
advanced beyond the primitive need for religion are sure society is full
of religious fanatics, except in their social circles of course.

The reality is religion in liberal democracy is nothing like this. The
people in charge of society are closer to fanatics on the belief scale,
while the people embracing traditional religion are somewhere in the
middle of the scale. Christianity no longer draws the fanatic like it
used to. Instead, the fanatics are drawn to the secular faiths like the
various forms of environmentalism or biological denialism. As a result,
the managerial class functions more like a theocracy than a bureaucracy.

You see this in the Megan Markle – Prince Harry drama that has been
foisted on us by the media -entertainment complex this week. There is no
reason for Americans to care much about this story. Markle is an
American, so the tabloids have a reason to cover her, as the Cinderella
story still sells to women, especially feminist women. On the other
hand, she is boring, and her prince is the booby prize of the family.
There was never a lot to sell here on the fairytale front with Megan
Merkle.

That was until she played the religion card. Megan Markle is an
octoroon, apparently, so she gets to carry on as an oppressed woman of
color, despite coming from a rich family and marrying into the British
royal family. In the new American religion, all blacks, no matter how
fortunate, are noble oppressed people. The big interview that set this
drama in motion was conducted by Oprah Winfrey, a woman worth over a
billion dollars, who regularly claims to be the victim of racism.

The absurdity of the premise should be enough to get the story laughed
off the stage, but in our modern theatrocracy, facts are not important.
What matter is how much the story stimulates the moral outrage of the
true believers in the audience. Because the heroine ticks the right
boxes and her nemesis ticks all of the right boxes, this story is *To
Kill A Mockingbird* for our true believers. The audience is divided into
those who support Markle, the good people, and those who doubt her.

This is not just an American thing. The great export of the American
empire is the effluvia of Progressive cultural norms. This has settled
on the Western world like a noxious fog, causing them to ape the moral
preening of Americans. As a result, the Brits are having the same drama
over this ridiculous woman and her claims to special status as a member
of the oppressed. The odious carbuncle, Piers Morgan, has <a
href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/global/meghan-markle-ofcom-investigation-1234925557/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">gotten himself in trouble</a> for taking
the wrong side on this.

Morgan is a vulgar carny with the IQ of a hamster, but he is well above
average at getting attention. This is why he has had a long television
career in two countries, despite being famously stupid. Success in
theatrocracy is about getting the audience to focus on you as the center
of the moral conflict, but only outraging the worst elements of the
audience, so you get some sympathy from the rest. You see that here with
the reaction to Morgan casting doubt on Markle tale of woe.

That Variety piece underscores the religious fanaticism at work.
According to the story, 41,000 people complained to the official censor
about Morgan. His crime was to doubt the story of the sacred black
woman. For these people, and most people in Britain probably, not
completely trusting a black person is no different than questioning the
divinity of Christ in the medieval times. On its face it is a sin
against the people and their faith, and the sinner must be sent to the
tower, no questions asked.

Morgan is professional carny trash, so he no doubt plotted this whole
thing as a way to get attention, but the fact that it works is what
matters. The English speaking world has now descended to the point where
the managerial class is animated by the worship of nonwhites, in the
same way primitives would deify a shaman. The mere presence of
well-behaved blacks is enough to cause orgiastic paroxysms among the
beautiful people and those who emulate them in the lower classes.

American blacks, of course, are an ideal god for these people. No matter
how wonderful the life of a black person, they are always complaining.
American blacks are the most bitter and ungrateful people to ever walk
the planet. Megan Markle is the full expression of that ungratefulness.
She has lived the very definition of the charmed life, but she is a
vinegar drinking shrew, living to make those around her miserable. She
is the ideal black goddess for a people riddled with self-loathing.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
