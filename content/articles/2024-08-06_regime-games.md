Today is supposed to be the big day when the world learns who the regime
has selected to be the running mate of kamala Harris. Last week, the
Mayor of Philadelphia tweeted out that it was to be Josh Shapiro, the
governor of Pennsylvania, but regime media ignored it. In fact, they
continue to ignore the story. As of now they are “reporting” that the <a
href="https://apnews.com/article/harris-running-mate-philadelphia-rally-multistate-tour-02c7ebce765deef0161708b29fe0069e"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">choice</a> is down to Pennsylvania Gov.
Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

Harris is scheduled to be cackling in Philadelphia today, so would make
sense if it were Shapiro, but regime media says the plan is to do the
reveal game show style like they did when Biden “picked” Harris. They
will stage a video of Harris calling the condemned man over Zoom,
because you know strong diverse female loves to use the latest
technology like a big girl. She will cackle, he will make the soy face
and accept his role as the loyal aid to girl boss.

One clue is this item
[posted](https://x.com/DanGreenMN/status/1820585720341278740) on
Twitter, now stupidly called X, showing a fleet of black SUV’s at the
home of the Minnesota governor. A similar thing happened at the home of
J.D. Vance once he was notified. Once the pick is made, the Secret
Service is dispatched to explain how things will work as far as
security. It is possible that this is some sort of ruse, but that would
be dumb even by Harris standards. On the other hand, she is a remarkably
stupid woman.

Regardless, you can get a sense of how the regime really thinks about
the race by the final three contestants. The fact that two are white men
and one is a Jewish man is what everyone will notice. More important is
that all three look old and therefore can be passed off as a steadying
force. They did this with Obama when they picked Biden to be his running
mate. The claim was that Biden was a longtime Washington insider and he
would help steady the Obama ship.

Of course, Biden was both an olive branch and an insurance policy. Team
Obama ruffled a lot of feathers in official Washington during the
primary and they made enemies of the Clinton crime family. Adding Biden
was a signal to permanent Washington that Obama was a team player. For
similar reasons he made Clinton Secretary of State and turned a blind
eye to her selling access. Biden was also an insurance policy, as no one
could imagine him being president.

Harris is completely controlled by the regime, as they selected her for
Biden and now have selected her to replace Biden. Her only base of
support is the regime, so there is no need to pick a running mate for
her that is regime friendly. Instead, they need someone that can make
her more plausible as a candidate. That is why they obviously cast
around for an old white guy. It is an admission that Harris comes off as
a bumbling simpleton that could frighten many white voters.

The fact that they have settled on three unknowns is also telling.
Shapiro is the only name with any recognition and that is only regional.
Walz and Kelly are complete unknowns outside their respective states.
Presumably all three can help win their respective states, which is
interesting given that Walz is the governor of Minnesota, a state
everyone thinks is safe. Trump lost there by 200,000 votes in 2020, but
only by 50,000 in 2016, so maybe it is not that safe.

Another thing about these three options is that none of them have been
mentioned as serious 2028 candidates. The big names like Gavin Newsom
and Karen Whitmer were not interested, as they probably think they can
win the nomination in 2028, even if the regime finagles Harris to a
general election win. Despite the regime media campaign the last two
weeks, the general consensus is that Harris is so terrible that once the
action starts her balloon deflates quickly.

Of the three, Shapiro is the best option, as he brings the massive vote
rigging machine to deliver the state to Harris. There are basically five
states that decide the presidency at the moment. Arizona, Nevada,
Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. There is some possibility that
Minnesota adds itself to the list. If we take Pennsylvania off the board
that leaves the four states and a
[251-to-245](https://www.270towin.com/maps/QP7bN) electoral college
score in favor of Trump, so Harris is within striking distance.

The problem with Shapiro is his biography makes clear that his primary
loyalty is to his people and his people are not Americans. He
volunteered to serve in the IDF, rather than the American military.
Imagine him explaining this while on stage with Vance, who served his
people in the Marines. A Harris – Shapiro ticket is so alien and weird
that even the dullest normie will notice it. A ticket that looks like
every television ad, rather than America is not a good look right now.

Kelly is probably the second-best option, mostly because he has a good
biography, but otherwise he adds nothing to the ticket. He is not the
most likable guy, which is not a great thing for a ticket already short
on charisma. Walz is the safest choice as he has carefully cultivated
the “aw shucks” hick-lib act and he is a true believer. Walz is Bernie
Sanders without the grating New York personality. He is Trotsky
reimagined as a character from the television series Fargo.

What all of this tells us is the regime continues to struggle keeping
all of the plates spinning, so they keep dashing about creating new
narratives. Week one was the “weird” nonsense and now they are going
with the claim that Trump is in a <a
href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/05/republicans-cringe-trump-harris-attacks-00172724"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">panic</a> over Harris having such a good
honeymoon. Like everything else we are seeing with the regime, there is
no thinking past the first move. As a result, they rush from one fire to
the next, claiming victory after avoiding disaster.
