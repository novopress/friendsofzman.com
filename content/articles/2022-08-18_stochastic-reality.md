One of the stranger things to come from the collection of sub-cults that
make up the modern Left is the concept of stochastic terrorism. In the
hands of the believers, it is not so much a concept as an incantation.
They chant it online in response to anything that contradicts their
beliefs. On Twitter, for example, they believe that if enough believers
chant it in response to a tweet they do not like, the gods of on-line
moderation will strike down the offending tweet and maybe the tweeter.

Taken literally, it is a meaningless expression. The first dictionary
definition of stochastic is random and the second is “involving chance
or probability.” The word comes from the Greek word “to guess” and has
been used in various fields to describe a range of probabilities within
a process. Terrorism, of course, is the use of violence and fear to
achieve an ideological aim. Taken together, stochastic terrorism would
literally mean random violence to achieve a political aim.

As is often the case, it has two meanings in the cult of the modern
Left. One is the purely emotional definition, which is always the
primary one. Stochastic terrorism is anything that upsets the user by
disconfirming her beliefs. Someone posting crime statistics, for
example, is accused of stochastic terrorism because crime statistics
contradict left-wing beliefs about society. The phrase is simply a way
to mark someone as a heretic or blasphemer.

Just as Eskimos allegedly have many words for snow, the modern Left has
many ways to identify a blasphemer. The logic behind the claim about
Eskimos and snow is they spend a lot of time around snow, so they have
to master the topic. Similarly, the modern Left imagines itself
surrounded by demonic enemies trying to hold back the tides of history,
so they invest their time in studying those enemies. The result is a
long list of words to describe the eyes in the darkness.

In this case, there is a larger meaning behind the incantation. What is
meant by the phrase is that people posting unapproved things on-line are
setting a range of possibilities by injecting the heresy into the
system. Some unknown percentage of people exposed to the heresy will act
on it. Some unknowable percentage of those people will commit an act of
violence. Posting crime stats will eventually result in a white man
killing a black body.

In other words, if a causal link can be imagined between speech and
action, then the link is as real as if the speaker commanded the actor.
We have quickly moved from the entirely implausible to the probable and
then to highly probable. In the mind of the believer, what follows is
the inevitable. You posting a graph about crime stats on Twitter will
inevitably lead to violence against black bodies, which means you are
the cause of crime against black bodies and therefore a terrorist.

This strikes normal people as insane and it is insane. It is another bit
of evidence to suggest what we think of as the modern Left is a form of
mental illness. The believers are in an imaginary war against imaginary
enemies. Instead of walking down a public road, ranting and waving their
arms at an invisible entity, they are on the internet harassing normal
people just trying to have a conversation, in the belief that the
conversation is part of a plot.

This is certainly true of the people on Twitter, which is something of a
bug light for the mentally unstable. Mass on-line culture draws in the
unstable looking for structure and they find it in the many subcultures.
The institutional Left has weaponized these people as a defense against
public scrutiny. Wherever normal people gather to talk about what is
happening in the world, these weaponized crazies try to prevent it. They
have been tuned to think normal people are the cause of their misery.

Further upstream, there is a logic to this idea of stochastic terrorism.
The managerial elite struggles to justify their position, so they
conjure these ideas as a way to legitimize their defensive actions. If
unapproved thoughts can lead to unapproved actions, then their
censorship actions are justified. They are not censoring speech. They
are protecting the vulnerable from potential violence. No matter how
improbable, they must prevent your words from causing the next 9/11.

This fits a general pattern with the American Left. The structure of
their thought is to act on the hypothetical, rather than the actual.
Look around at the range of issues popular on the Left and all of them
are based on a firm belief in the hypothetical. It is possible that
climate change is caused by humans. We do not know, but we have to
pretend we know and act accordingly. We do not know if racism is a real
thing, but we have to assume it is and make war on it.

This gets to something else about the American Left. They firmly believe
they can immanentize whatever they can imagine. They create a mental
construct, like what is behind the stochastic terrorism incantation. The
construct is that speech leads to a range of actions. Then they leap
from this model of reality to believing it is reality, more real that
observable reality. Rather than interact with the real world, they
operate within the constructed world as if it is reality.

This is how entirely novel ideas become bedrock truth in a an instant.
Ten years ago, a man in a dress was a crossdresser. Then someone
produced an alterative reality in which humans are assigned a gender at
birth. Note the replacement of the word *sex* with the word *gender*.
The former is used on living things while the latter is used for
inanimate objects like pipe fittings and electrical connectors. The
misappropriation of language is integral to their world building.

Once you cross from the biological reality of sex to the conjured
reality of gender, the imaginer is free to reinvent humanity. The man in
a dress is another gender and people can choose their genders. Reality
becomes a video game where the player can create any character they
like. It is a form of escapism, but this alterative reality quickly
supplants actual reality for the player. Overnight, normal people find
themselves around people who are sure biological reality terrorism.

The question is why now? What has gone wrong in the West leading to this
epidemic of delusional madness? Is it a novel parasite that leads some
people to slip from the bounds of reality into these imaginary worlds?
Is it new at all or just an old part of the human condition we used to
control? There is the possibility that mass communication has allowed
these deranged people that have always been with us to form up in ways
that were previously impossible.

It is hard to know, but what is clear is that these people are much
better at conjuring alternative realities than the world is at defending
reality. This increased ability to conjure alterative realities and then
act on them means the odds of them conjuring a cataclysmic reality has
gone up. Put another way, the longer they are allowed to freely create
alternative realities, the more likely they are to conjure one that ends
in the destruction of the West.

That gets to the universal of the Left. They project onto the world the
things they hate about themselves or fear they may be doing. The
emergence of stochastic terrorism as an incantation suggests that at
some level, they sense their repeated rolling of the dice on reality
must come up snake eye eventually. In other words, their very existence
will result in some random act of destruction. If the death cult that is
the Left rolls the dice enough times, they will get their wish.
