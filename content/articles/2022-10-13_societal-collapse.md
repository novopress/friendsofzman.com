------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most people think of societal collapse as something like a zombie
apocalypse where everything suddenly stops working. Instead of people
turning into brain eating zombies, they stop going to work. The “system”
collapses, so everyone just stops doing what they normally do all of a
sudden. The next day, people divide up into gangs and begin to guard
their turf using what is left of modern weapons. Life quickly returns to
a hunter-gatherer existence with modern clothes.

This image of collapse is a powerful one. Google the phrase “United
States collapse” or some version of it and you get results going back
many years. Most of them start with economics but some start with
culture. Right now, the people we call the Left for some reason think
America is on the verge of collapse because they cannot force people to
nod along with their weird morality. Many normal people think collapse
is coming because they see the food bill every week.

Of course, there is a market for taking the contrary view. This is a
popular gag for internet characters on what we continue to call the
Right. They counter the claims from their fellow anti-leftists with
arguments for why the “founding principals” will prevail and avoid
societal collapse. Maybe they will point out that the magic of the free
market has conquered communism, so it will conquer whatever is happening
now. It is a form of strategic gainsaying to get attention.

The thing is societal collapse is a real thing that does happen just as
civil wars, revolutions, wars and social upheavals are real things.
Thirty years ago, the Soviet Union collapsed and we got to watch lots of
it on television. When people suddenly realized that the guards were not
going to shoot them if they tried to escape to the West, it did not take
long before order broke down. Once the process started, there was no way
to stop it and the system collapsed.

The thing is it did not happen overnight. The collapse actually started
much earlier but people did not notice it. Little things stopped
working. For example, people in Hungary began to notice that the border
to Austria was not always guarded. Maybe the guards were there and
ignored their duty or they just abandoned their post. Over time the
border was not much of a border. Similar breakdowns of small systems
became common over the course of the 1980’s.

Of course, the collapse of the Soviet Union did not send these societies
back to the stone age either. Politics became increasingly chaotic. Law
and order broke down to the point where criminal gangs were imposing
their will on whole cities, because the police no longer had the ability
or desire to stop them. The people got poorer in many small ways, but
mostly in the breakdown of trust. They could not rely on the system, so
they slowly abandoned it for alternatives.

We do not think of social trust as a part of the poverty equation, but
in realty it is the key component of social happiness. High trust
societies may not have unlimited consumer goods, but the people trust
the system, because they trust one another. This allows for long term
planning. Africa will never be rich, despite having massive natural
resources, because social trust is near zero. Finland will never be poor
because the Finns can count on their fellow Finns to always be Finnish.

Social collapse, like war and revolution, will reflect the material
relations of the age because those reflect the resources of society.
Revolution in the 18th century was peasants with pitchforks, because
that is how you can revolt in an agrarian society operating under feudal
rules. In the 19th century revolution was workers hurling homemade bombs
and shooting at the authorities, because that is how you can stage a
revolt in an industrial urban society.

This is the information age, so revolution will reflect the weapons we
choose to use in this age, which will be money and knowledge. Money in
all of its forms is a type of information that says things about the
general state of affairs. In completely financialized societies like the
West, money is the big weapon. It is also other information, like the
government [hiring
clowns](https://newspunch.com/bidens-hhs-and-cdc-paid-screen-writers-and-comedians-to-mock-the-unvaccinated/)
and carnies to nudge people in the “right direction” during the Covid
panic.

The great tumult in the West over the last decade has been centered on
the things that are important in the information age. The rise of a new
group of oligarchs was made possible by the technological revolution.
Just as agrarian people measured wealth in land and industrial people
measured wealth in capital, technological people measure wealth in
control of information flows. The reason Mark Zuckerberg is richer than
Bill Gates is he controls something more valuable than PC’s.

Societal collapse in the information age will, at least at the
beginning, reflect the socioeconomic relations of the age. Trust in what
we are told by the media has collapsed, because it is easier to see the
lying than in prior ages. In 1985 you could think the New York Times was
biased, but predictably so. Today, you cannot trust anything they say
because it is false in unpredictable ways. Trust in the media has
collapsed because their information is chaotically false.

The slow collapse of trust in our information is spreading. We used to
think that the courts were predictable, if not always fair. Poor people
might not get the same justice as rich people, but the reason was
understood. If you could afford a competent lawyer, he would get the
most from the system for you. Today, no one knows what the hell will
happen in a courtroom. Alex Jones just got fined a billion dollars
because the regime supporters are still salty about the 2016 election.

Of course, trust in government is collapsing not because they do not fix
the streets or make the buses run on time. Trust is falling because they
lie. It is not about politicians lying, which is expected and
predictable. It is the government itself. For example, they appear to be
faking key [economic
data](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Dodgy-Demand-Data-The-Oil-Price-Collapse-Conspiracy.html).
Their inflation numbers are laughable as anyone who buys food will tell
you. They also like to change the meaning of words, which puts an
Orwellian spin on the lying.

Getting back to the topic of collapse, what happens in the information
age when no one trusts the information? In a world where your bank may
close down your account because they claim you hold the wrong opinions;
how can you trust them to be straight about anything else? If the
government is faking economic data, how can we trust anything else they
are doing? When the people responsible for 100% of disinformation claim
to be fighting disinformation, who can we trust?

When the Soviet system began to collapse, it was the symbols of its
power that first came under pressure. When people stopped fearing the
border guard, they slowly stopped fearing the system behind it. The same
will be true in this age. When people stop trusting the information that
runs this world, they will slowly begin to stop trusting the system
behind it. It is at that point the system begins to slowly unravel as
alternative trust networks form up to fill the void.

The bottom line is those waiting for collapse are mistaken. It is not a
thing that is looming over the horizon. It is a thing that is happening
now. Every day there is a new reminder that the system cannot be
trusted. Maybe it is ten dollar gas in Germany or skyrocketing food
prices in England or demonstrably false claims from the drug makers with
regards to the Covid jab. These things chip away at trust in the system
and like the game of Jenga, the result is inevitable.
