The show this week was pre-recorded as I am probably swinging from a
truck as you are reading this. Moving day(s) has arrived. Through it
all, I have had to deal with a lot of people I would not otherwise
interact with and I kept noticing that the quality of people has dropped
sharply. I will post about my experience renting a moving truck, which
will cause even a sunny optimist yo have dark thoughts.

Anyway, that is the show this week. It is about how the decline in
intelligence will impact our live and society. The people who think AI
will solve it or that robots will pick up the slack have not thought
about the problem hard enough. All of those things will make the decline
worse for the people with anything on the ball. Imagine Idiocracy by
terminators are in charge instead of morons.
