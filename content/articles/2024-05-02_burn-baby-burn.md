For the last few weeks, protests have raged at some elite colleges
between anti-Zionists in support of Gaza and Zionist in support of
Israel. At Columbia University in New York City, the protests
essentially closed the college. The cops were finally sent in yesterday
to clear the pro-Gaza camp, but at this point there is probably no point
in trying to resume the spring semester. At other colleges, police
continue to battle with protestors in an effort to restore order.

The protests provide some insight into what is happening among the Cloud
People and also some insight into how the Dirt People see the Cloud
People. It has been a long time since factions of the anti-white
coalition that makes up what we call the left have squared off against
each other. As a result, the Cloud People are struggling to grapple with
what is happening. Usually, it is easy for them to pick sides, as the
protestors are always targeting Dirt People.

The first thing worth noting is that the pro-Gaza protestors are not
white. It is anti-Zionist Jews and nonwhites, with a smattering of
upper-middle-class white girls from the grievance studies programs. The
pro-Israel side is primarily Jewish students organized by the network of
anti-BDS organizations that exist on every campus. As a result, the
pro-Gaza side uses the antiwhite language they have been trained to use
against the mostly Jewish protestors on the other side.

One result of this is the bellowing about antisemitism has had no effect
on the protestors or their supporters among the faculty and media. This
is has been the most powerful magic in American politics for so long
that no one remembers a time when it was not otherwise, but the magic
seems to be fading. Amusingly, this has the conservative commentariat
chanting “antisemitism” even louder, sort of like how English speakers
shout at foreign fast-food workers.

One reason for this is the youth are not as white as they used to be due
to the deliberate demographic changes over the last half century. This
is especially true on the college campus where antiwhite activism is now
admissions policy. Those nonwhites and post-whites trained up to hate
whitey now look at the people carrying Israeli flags and repeat the
classic Jared Taylor line, “They look huwhite to me.” It would take a
heart of stone to not laugh at this development.

There is a serious element here. Young people are nowhere near as
supportive of Israel as in the past, due mostly to demographics. Support
for Israel remains strong with old white people, but support declines
rapidly after the boomers. There is also an antisemitism fatigue setting
in with whites. Decades of crying wolf has had the natural impact on the
culture. People are tired of the complaining from people who have done
better in America than any other group.

There is another angle here. The shuffling husk that is the conservative
movement has been trying to do what it exists to do, which is get white
people to focus on the *how* and *why*, rather than the *who* and
*what*. They shout about the pro-Gaza side being communists and
antisemites, so their aging followers will focus on that rather than the
fact these people do not belong here. They do not want you to notice the
two alien tribes from the Levant fighting it out on the college campus.

That is why they jumped on the
<a href="https://twitter.com/greg_price11/status/1785682387910738097"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">image</a> of the “frat boys” supposedly
“defending” the American flag at UNC. It was a staged photo by the usual
suspects because this sort of boomer bait always works to distract
middle-class white people. The “frat boys” were part of some anti-BDS
operation. They were also waving around an Israel flag, but that was
trimmed from the scene. This sort of thing is a reminder that
conservatism exists to distract white people from what is happening.

The fact is none of the people involved in these protests should be in
the country and that is what people should notice. Thirty percent of the
undergrad student body in Columbia is foreign. Less than half of the
student body is classified as white and half of those identify as
Jewish. If you are the typical white person, Columbia University may as
well be located in another solar system. It is not just a foreign place.
It is an alien place that rests on hostility toward you.

These protests not only suggest fractures in the antiwhite coalition,
but they suggest the Potemkin opposition in American politics is losing
its grip. The Republican response to these riots was to pass a bill
banning parts of the Christian Bible and stripping you of your right to
criticize foreign governments. The Antisemitism Awareness Act is
probably the most vulgar and depraved piece of legislation to ever pass
the House, and it passed with overwhelming support from Republicans.

The Republicans passed this, in part, because they are trapped in 1985.
They still think their voter base cares more about Israel than anything
else. The
<a href="https://twitter.com/RepMikeLawler/status/1785786891490501111"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">idiot</a> who dreamed up this monstrosity
is right out of central casting. He is the typical clueless zombie that
gets recruited into Republican politics, because he is biologically
incapable of noticing what is happening all around him. The GOP is the
party of feckless, clueless goofballs who can no longer play the role
for which they exist.

In the end, these protests matter to Dirt People only in so far as they
indicate problems among the Cloud People. None of these people are on
our side and all of them would lock shields with the other side if asked
to put on their Antifa and BLM outfits in order to terrorize white
people this summer. The hope is that both sides of these protests are
committed to the theory of escalatory dominance. After all, revolutions
often grow out of the cracks in the ruling coalition.
