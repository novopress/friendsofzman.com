The ouster of Kevin McCarthy is one of those things that quickly gets
internalized, despite its novelty, because the media machine operates
like a hype man for a professional wrestling operation. It turns
everything into trashy daytime drama, so even an important thing becomes
just another poo-flinging contest between professional media partisans.
As a result, it loses all meaning.

In the fullness of time, we may look back at it as one of those cracks
that appeared in a system that was about to collapse. Think back to the
downfall of Speaker Jim Wright in the late 1980’s and what followed.
Like McCarthy, Wright was not very popular, but he was a system man who
would not rock the boat. The trouble was the old system was no longer
sustainable as the world outside was changing.

In the case of Wright, there was a new generation coming along and there
was the final leg of the political realignment that started in the
1970’s. In the case of McCarthy there is a generational change and the
radicalization of politics. The days of playing the old Republican Party
tricks are coming to an end. McCarthy’s “say one thing and do another”
approach is no longer going to work for the GOP.

The thing not getting enough attention is the fact that the Democrats
were willing to let him swing rather than cut a deal. Maybe it was pure
partisan spite or just incompetence, but they left money on the table in
order to avoid being seen by their donors and voters making a deal with
the other side. Even the dumbest Republican had to notice the unanimity
of their “friends across the aisle.”

This McCarthy business suggests Washington may be reaching one of those
inflection points like 1994 or 1974. The baby boomer generation is about
to leave the stage just as the world is changing rapidly. When Speaker
Wright was toppled, the boomers were ready to take over as the Cold War
was coming to an end. As the millennials are taking over, the Global
American Empire is coming to an end.
