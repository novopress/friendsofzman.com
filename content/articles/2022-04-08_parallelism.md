From time to time a debate breaks out in outsider politics between those
who prefer meta politics and those who prefer activism. The former takes
the view that it is ideas that drive history so getting the ideas right
is the priority. The latter notes that we live in the real world not the
world of ideas. Keeping the groomers out of the schools, for example, is
what matters now. You are not going to talk them out of it so you have
to get involved in order to solve the immediate problem

This is a debate that has haunted conservative politics and it was
something that haunted radical politics until the 20th century.
Conservatives never solved the problem and it eventually ruined them.
The reason is they committed to participating in a political system that
leaves no room for conservative ideas. Once you sign onto the long list
of left-wing taboos and mob rule, there is nothing worth defending.
Conservatives became the tax collectors of liberal democracy.

For dissidents this is a bigger challenge. There is no solution to the
problems of liberal democracy at the ballot box. Most Americans have no
representation in politics as both parties are committed to destroying
normal life. This fall the Republicans will win the election and
everything will get worse. Whatever promises they have made will be
broken on day one. They will set about giving the oligarchs whatever
they want while pretending they are doing their voters a favor.

Even knowing this, people want to do something. This is even more true
for dissidents who are more political than normal people. The reason you
end up on this side of the great divide is you have engaged with
politics and learned from it. Walking away entirely seems like quitting
to most people. On the other hand, participating just empowers the
people who want you dead. This is the dilemma that ruined the
conservative movement and haunts the dissident right.

This leaves only one option and that is building a counter culture.
Channeling activism into building a parallel society bridges the gap
between ideas and activism. In a way, this is what we see globally with
the alliance of non-Western powers. China, Russia and India want to
create a parallel system that can challenging America. The same thing
has to happen domestically. It is a bigger challenge for obvious
reasons, but parallelism is the only way forward short of revolution.
