One of the puzzles of the war in the Ukraine, debated by those watching
through sources outside of Western media, is why are the Ukrainians
doing what they are doing in this war. Their tactics make little sense
and suggest the over all strategy is something other than what has been
stated. In fact, official statements from the Zelensky government have
become absurdly strident. They bring back memories of Baghdad Bob during
the American invasion of Iraq.

The initial phase of the war had the Russians dashing in, probably
hoping for a negotiated settlement based on the Minsk accords. Some
think they underestimated the Ukrainian capabilities and willingness to
fight. There are lots of people who claim to be psychics, knowing what
was in the minds of the Russian planners, but no one knows what the
Russians expected. All we know is they got a bloody nose in the opening
weeks and had to reconfigure their war plans.

This is the nature of war. The old line about no war plan lasting first
contact with the enemy is a cliché because it is true. The Russians had
to change gears and they did that in the early spring. They settled into
a strategy of shelling the Ukrainian positions with their superior
artillery and missile systems. They also gained air superiority so they
can hunt down Ukrainian targets all over the country. This is a low-cost
way to slowly and methodically grind down the Ukrainian military.

Here is the puzzle. Why have the Ukrainians not responded to this change
in tactics so as not to be slowly ground down by the Russians? Logic
says they should have withdrawn from the Donbas to more defensible
positions. This would have preserved their best troops and much of their
equipment. They could have appealed to the West for better air defense
systems to protect their army as they prepared for a counter offensive
at some point in the future.

No one really seems to know how much Western military gear has flowed
into Ukraine, but the best guess is more than enough to supply a million
man army. The Europeans dumped a fair bit of old equipment onto Ukraine,
but they have also supplied a fair bit of modern equipment as well. The
Russians have modern equipment, but the militias, who are doing the bulk
of the fighting, are relying on Soviet era tanks and armored personnel
carriers so this old stuff is not worthless.

Of course, one of the lessons of this war is that old planes, trucks and
tanks can be repurposed as unmanned vehicles. The Russians are actively
converting their old aircraft into crude drones. They are not as good as
the high end stuff, but it is better than scrapping them. Ukraine could
have been doing this as well if they had pulled back from the Donbas and
been preparing for a counter offensive. Instead, the old equipment has
been hurled into the meatgrinder of the Donbas.

The elephant in the room whenever discussing the war in the Ukraine is
the massive amount of corruption. We know from the Trump years that many
American politicians were on the payroll of corrupt Ukrainian firms. We
know the State Department is full of Ukrainian operatives. We know that
what ties these people to the Ukrainian government is highly corrupt
Ukrainian oligarchs. Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma, an
oligarch controlled energy monopoly in Ukraine.

That is the key to unriddling the Ukraine war strategy. The key players
in American foreign policy only care about harming Russia. The neocon
obsession with Russia goes back generations now. They have made clear on
multiple occasions that their only goal in the Ukraine is to inflict as
much damage on the Russians as possible. This has come from senior
people in the Biden regime, as well as various characters operating in
the unofficial foreign policy establishment.

Take the Russia obsessed foreign policy establishment and join it to the
hyper-corrupt Ukrainian regime and you have the makings of a grand
grift. The other piece of it is the Military Industrial Complex, which
will sell NATO countries trillions in new arms over the next decade, to
replace what is going to Ukraine. The Ukraine has become a massive money
laundering scheme. Billions flow into the place with little or no
accounting and much of it ends up in anonymous bank accounts.

This is where the Ukrainian ware strategy fits into the scam. The
neocons need a narrative to sell the politicians and the public. The
“heroic Ukrainian defenders willing to fight to the last man” is the
story they initially sold. Over the last few months, the new story has
been “If the heroic Ukrainian defenders just had better weapons, they
could take the fight to the Ruskies!” The myth of the wonder weapon, of
course, works nicely in the Raytheon brochure.

Meanwhile, the actual Ukrainian fighters are hunkered down into massive,
fortified locations while the Russians shell them day and night. Reports
from the front suggest few of the weapons are making it to the men. CBS
did a report suggesting that only 30% of weapons have gone into battle.
They were forced to recant, but their reporting comports with what
others have said. The fact is, no one knows where this stuff is going or
if it is even useful to the soldiers.

The whole thing relies on defending a one thousand mile front in the
Donbas against an endless artillery barrage. Imagine a front that
stretched from New York to Miami and along the way cities have been
turned into massive, fortified bunker complexes and you have a good idea
of what is happening. The Russians shell these fortifications at will
and the Ukrainians have no chance to take the fight to the Russians.
They just have to sit there and take the pounding for public relations
reasons.

Even by current standards, this sounds amazingly cynical, but stop and
think about what happened during the Covid panic. The people who made
tens of billions on a dangerous, experimental vaccine are not going to
blink at sacrificing tens of thousands, maybe millions, of Ukrainians to
make billions in profits. The people who turned America into a pirate’s
cove are taking the strategy global. Everything is a grift and no grift
is too bloody or monstrous.

At some point, a marketing plan with the phrase “to the last Ukrainian”
in it will run out of Ukrainians to sell it. There are ongoing shakeups
in the Ukrainian leadership so that part of the grift may be starting to
crack. There are growing rumors of defections in the military as they
wake up to what is happening to them. Of course, the truly terrifying
winter that lies ahead for all of Europe cannot be ignored. The reality
of Ukraine will become apparent and then what happens?

History says not much. Covid is a good guide. There is no doubt that
trust in the institutions has declined as a result of the Covid scam.
The ongoing effects of the vaccine could blow up into a major scandal.
None of which has moved people into the streets, but there has been a
cumulative effect on the public psyche. A collapse in Ukraine would be
another blow to the regime. Still, it is hard to see this being the
straw that breaks the camel’s back, but crazier things have happened.
