One of the more bizarre but illuminating aspects of Elon Musk’s takeover
of Twitter has been the panic over his changes to the blue check. <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/20/tech/twitter-verification-blue-check-purge/index.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is CNN reporting on it as if it
is a natural disaster. <a
href="https://www.axios.com/2023/04/23/verified-checkmark-twitter-badge"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is a Sara and Rebecca over at
Axios hissing and snarling at the new policy as if it is a crucifix.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeIvh4xnJ0c" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Here</a> are two airheads at MSNBC cheering the SpaceX
explosion as they issue a fatwah against Musk over his new polices. This
jock-sniffing weirdo at Slate has <a
href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/04/elon-musk-twitter-blue-checkmarks-verification-lebron-james.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">declared</a> Musk a business failure.

The reason for the panic is Musk has gone ahead with his plan to make
the blue check into a badge of access, rather than a symbol of moral
goodness. If you want extra features on the Twitter platform, like
longer posts and the ability to edit a tweet, you pay Musk for Twitter
Blue, his premium service. Premium members get a blue check next to
their fake name on their profile. This means all of the blue checks will
be losing their blue check unless they pony up for the premium service.

To a normal person, this seems reasonable. Twitter is a business, and a
business needs to earn money. Gab has been issuing badges to their
premium users and their donors for a long time. Many sites have switched
to a pay wall for commenting. If you want to comment on a post, you have
to pay for the privilege. Many people hate this, as they have been
conditioned to think everything online is free. Everyone becomes a
communist when it comes to paying for content.

This is not the reason for the blue check panic. People forget that the
whole point of the blue check was to prevent people from using your
online identity to either ruin your brand or exploit people in your
name. You provided identification to Twitter so they could verify that
you were the real you and then they put that tick mark next to your name
so everyone could know the moron behind those idiotic tweets was you and
not some other moron pretending to be you.

It did not take long for the activists to turn this mundane feature into
something like the star from Dr. Suess story, the Star-Bellied
Sneetches. You see, the good people were willing to post online under
their real name, so they were happy to submit their ID to the Twitter
police for inspection. The bad people with their heretical ideas and
penchant for blasphemy, posted under fake names. They hid in the
shadows, ashamed of their actions, because they are the unclean!

Of course, like the Dr. Suess story, it could not end there as plenty of
bad people were willing to show face and get the blue check. Soon the
blue check was revoked from the bad people as a way to show the world
they were bad. The blue check was now a badge of moral purity. The blue
checks were inside the hive walls, while the no checks were the
undifferentiated other outside the walls. The blue checks were now the
priestly class of the Twitter platform.

It did not stop there. Twitter rigged their system so that the blue
checks would get more attention and more followers. Musk has not
confirmed it, but he has hinted at the possibility that the large bot
army controlled by Twitter was used to artificially elevate blue checks
over no checks. RamZPaul saw his engagement and follower count spike
after Musk took over and deleted the old rules. Many no checks saw their
follower counts double in weeks after Musk took control.

In effect, Twitter created a massive online safe space for the blue
checks where they not only could avoid “violent language” but also have
the robots reassured them through artificially boosting their
engagement. In other words, they created an online version of the world
they imagine is possible in real life. In fact, much of the tech
censorship regime assumes that they can create a narrative so powerful
that it changes physical reality itself.

That is why they are in a panic over the new policy. This barbarian has
entered the temple and stripped them of their status. Worse yet, he is
auctioning off their privilege to the great unwashed. Many of the former
blue checks are carrying on like they have been physically assaulted by
Musk. Since they are sure their narratives can be made real if you
silence the opposition, they no doubt think what Musk is doing to
Twitter foreshadows a new holocaust in the real world.

This strikes normal people as completely nuts, which is why normal
people struggle to accept that these people really do believe this
stuff. When the scolds claim that your speech is violence, but their
violence is speech, they are not lying. They concocted the term
“stochastic violence” to describe it. The former blue checks howling in
agony are experiencing real pain. For them, the holocaust of the blue
checks on Twitter is more real to them than physical reality.

What is happening at Twitter is a microcosm for what must happen in
American society if we are to avoid disaster. The managerial class is
the blue check army made flesh, and they must be stripped of their
status by the real owners of society. Maybe they get lucky, and the rich
guys follow the lead of Musk and begin taking back control of society by
purging their organizations of these false priests. If you are hoping
for a soft landing, the Twitter example is the place to start.

The Twitter example also shows how difficult it is to root out these
people once they sink their roots into an organization. It is like
casting out a demon. Musk may eventually have to take Twitter through
bankruptcy in order to save it. Scaling this up to society as a whole
will require far more than a billionaire shit-poster. Even so, it does
provide a path to avoiding the great disaster that comes from allowing
these spiteful mutants to run wild through the culture.
