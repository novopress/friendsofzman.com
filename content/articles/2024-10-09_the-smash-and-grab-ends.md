This weekend, the heads of the NATO families were supposed to meet to
discuss the “victory plan” for Ukraine created by Volodymyr Zelensky,
but the meeting has been <a
href="https://www.rferl.org/a/ramstein-meeting-on-ukraine-cancelled-nato-sources-tell-rfe-rl/33152025.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">cancelled</a>, allegedly due to the
weather. Joe Biden was supposed to attend but dropped out on Tuesday due
to hurricane Milton. The peace summit Zelensky was planning was also
cancelled. When Zelensky was in Washington last month he was given
millions to hold a second peace conference.

One thing that was supposed to be discussed at this meeting was a plan
that has been in the works for eighteen months according to the
Financial Times. This [story](https://archive.is/sWAci) covers the
basics of the new plan for victory. Russia would be handed a deal
whereby they get to hold the lands they have, Ukraine joins NATO, but
promises to not start a war to reclaim those lands and at some point in
the future, Russia will give back those lands to Ukraine for reasons no
one can explain.

The scheme is ridiculous, which is probably why the intel service
planted the story in the Financial Times this week. This has become a
habit of the Anglo intelligence services over the last year. When they
want something injected into the political discussion regarding Ukraine
or they want to elicit a Russian reaction to something discussed behind
closed doors, they plant a story in the Financial Times. Presumably,
this story was placed there ahead of the meeting for some reason.

Officially, the main focus of the meeting was supposed to be the
Zelensky plan for peace, which has two main parts. One is Ukraine joins
NATO right now and Russia agrees to return all lands claimed by Ukraine.
That is pretty much it. The path to victory is the United States
threatens Moscow with nuclear war unless the Russians withdraw all of
their forces from Ukraine, including Crimea. The reason to cancel the
meeting is there is nothing really to discuss. The plan is nonsense.

That may be the reason why Zelensky created the plan and spent the last
month shopping it around the West. The one thing Zelensky cannot survive
right now is a peace process involving the Russians. The reason for that
is the ultranationalists in Kiev and on the front are strong enough to
oppose it. They can use the process as an excuse to take out Zelensky.
On the other hand, Zelensky cannot simply flee with his billion dollars,
as the West will not protect him.

He is in a political vice. One jaw is the nationalist forces that have
been committed to war with Russian since the Maiden coup in 2014.
Despite the losses on the battlefield, they remain committed to the war.
They have no choice from their perspective, as a Russian condition for
peace talks is dissolution of the nationalists. Given the Russian habits
and recent history, the leaders of these nationalists forces are right
to assume dissolution means they end up dead.

The other jaw is the West, which has committed itself to the war against
Russia, but is unwilling to go all in fearing the consequences. The
truth is escalatory dominance only works if the other side believes you
can continue to escalate. The Russians know the West is not willing to
go all in for Ukraine. The West is now in a trap they created for
themselves in 2022 and 2023 with all the hot rhetoric. They need a way
out, but they cannot simply quit, so they need Zelensky to make a deal.

For his part, Zelensky has been a rapacious schemer who has survived far
longer than anyone expected. He does not get credit for managing to stay
alive while existing in this impossible position. He must wage a war
enthusiastically that he knows cannot be won, but also keep the various
factions from pointing the finger at him for the failure to find a
miracle solution to the battlefield reality. So far, he has
outmaneuvered all of his opponents in Kiev, which is miraculous.

It looks like the Zelensky victory plan is actually a survival plan. The
game is to buy time so that the nationalist units on the front get worn
down or destroyed, thus weakening their political support in Kiev. As
the saying goes, political power comes from the barrel of a gun. If
there is going to be a move against Zelensky, it will include
nationalist military units. If those units are buried under rubble in
the Donbas, then they will not be around to depose Zelensky.

For their part, the nationalist units seem to get this, as they have
repeatedly refused orders to engage with the Russians in difficult
battles. Despite having the best equipment and the best men, they have
been held in reserve for most of the war, most likely for political
reasons. That cannot go on much longer, given the condition of the
front, so time is probably on Zelensky’s side. At some point, the
nationalists either die on the front or quit on the war.

Of course, all of this assumes the Russians will be willing to deal with
Zelensky when the time comes. It also assumes the West will not kill him
as an excuse to wash their hands of the project. Then you have the
nationalists who may simply kill Zelensky because they can, and they
have never liked him. The Zelensky survival plan assumes many things
that may turn out to be unrealistic, but for now it is the only plan he
has, so he is working it as hard as he can.

That may be the other reason for the cancellation of the Ramstein
meeting. It may be dawning on the Western political class that there is
no plan for victory because victory is impossible and Zelensky has known
it for a long time. His little green man act was just part of the long
con he has been running to both remain in power and get hundreds of
billions in financing, some of which has underwritten his retirement.
The West now needs a plan for how to not look like dupes.

In this regard, the Ukraine war is a metaphor for the West. Everything
about this project has been in the short term. Everyone involved is
thinking like a smash and grab gang working the shopping mall. At the
macro level, it is as if the West is controlled by an alien class that
is here to harvest what they can before moving on to the next
opportunity to run the next grift. As with Ukraine, no one thinks about
investing in the people or the long-term consequences of their actions.
