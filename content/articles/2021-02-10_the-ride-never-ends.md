The reboot of last year’s big political flop, otherwise known as *Trump
Impeachment*, hit the big stage in DC this week. The Senate kicked off
the show with a debate about the constitutionality of the whole thing.
The old rule of vaudeville was that you start every show with some jokes
to warm up the audience. It is good to see Washington bringing back the
old traditions for their political dramas. To the shock of no one, the
Senate voted in favor of the claim that this nonsense is constitutional.

The one thing missing from this reboot is the boggle-eyed lunatic who
was the master of ceremonies for the first one. Adam Schiff is sitting
this out. There is some debate about whether having a paranoid
schizophrenic be the star of the show was the reason the first try at
this was an embarrassing flop. They also had the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ik531Q0AwE" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">fat guy who poos himself</a> in public as the co-star.
The whole thing turned into a poorly made version of Dumb and Dumber,
which is a problem when you are putting on a drama.

The early reviews say this reboot is looking like the high school
version of an old Broadway musical. The writing is good, but the people
playing the roles are far too small for the costumes they are wearing.
Even without Trump looming over it as a reminder that our politics have
long ago descended into farce, the idea of impeaching a man who is out
of office is too much to overcome. The public is mostly ignoring it,
despite the month long hype about the imaginary insurrection.

Like so much the shadowy cabal that runs this place has done over the
last several years, this stunt just serves to undermine the system they
operate. In a world where massive election irregularities are ignored
and dismissed by the politicians, it is tough to take those same
politicians seriously when they bang on about their democracy or
imaginary threats to it. If they were really worried about their
democracy, maybe they would do something about the voting system.

What this looks like is theater for the people inside the wire so they
can be reminded there is a wire, and it must be maintained. The green
zone they have erected for themselves is not simply an overreaction. It
is a symbol of the spiritual and cultural divide between the people
running this place and the rest of us. The hive minded have now created
a physical manifestation of their world view. From now on, people inside
will be made to show they are loyal to inside, not outside.

Putting that aside, the thumbless people behind this farce are creating
a new set of problems for themselves with this. American politics has
always been a game of bad cop worse cop. One side tells 20% of white
people they will push through some nation wrecking scheme, while the
other side tells 40% of white people that they will not roll back the
last nation wrecking scheme, but they will stop this one. This has kept
white people engaged in a process that has slowly dispossessed them.

The rigged election and the response to it broke this system. Despite
the Republicans pulling all the usual tricks in an effort to scare their
voters in Georgia during the special election, many of those voters
stayed home. The old gags did not work, because the election put the lie
to those old gags. Impeachment promises to hammer home this point to
tens of millions of white people. One party hates them, and the other
party really hates them. They do not have a voice in this system.

We have already seen some Republican Senators shed their skin suits,
revealing their scaly natural exterior. Six of them slithered over to
the other side, coiling around the legs of their master, to vote in
favor of this farce. You can be sure they will be voting to convict when
the time comes. Conventional wisdom says the Senate will not get the
votes to convict, but given the state of things, that is not a good bet.
The GOP would love to be rid of Trump forever and this is how they do
it.

If you assume that a third of the GOP senators hate Trump and his
voters, that is roughly 15 votes right there. Then you have the deluded
members who think they can inherit that vote if Trump is forced off the
stage. They think their kinder gentler populism will win the day. Then
there are those who are taking bribes. The level of corruption in
Washington is such that we have to assume all of them are on the pad.
Maybe the ChiComs tell them to support a conviction.

Either way, the whole thing will most likely further undermine the
Republicans as the security fence for the Democrats. This is very bad
for the political class, as it further reinforces the notion that there
are now two sides. Those inside the razor wire green zone and those
outside it. Given the general cluelessness of the people running both
parties, this is a very dangerous environment for them. They need to
people trusting in the system, even if they do not trust the people
running the system.

There is one interesting side story to this. Trump put up a solid
defense of himself in the first impeachment circus. He hired competent
lawyers and treated the whole thing with far more respect than it
deserved. This time he has hired a B-team that is more concerned with
melodrama than the process. It may be that Trump would welcome a
conviction and disqualification. This lets him go back to being a gassy
blowhard on-line, without having to deliver any of the things he
promises.

Another bit of subplot here is that the larger show that was the “great
fortifying of our democracy”, which looked a lot like coup, is coming to
a close. This is the last bit of the drama the new regime can use to
distract from reality. That reality is they own the mess they created in
their effort to overthrow the system. The crumbling economy, the Covid
fiasco, the bloated financial system, all of it. They will not have
Trump to kick around anymore, so they will own what comes next. Good
luck with that.
