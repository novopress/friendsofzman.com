Conservatives have been programmed to reject anything that smacks of
pessimism regarding America’s future. They continue to hold out hope
that some combination of miracles will put the right people in charge of
the state and they will set about reforming the nation. Then there are
those who blithely say something along the lines of “we always muddle
along somehow. We can make it through this.” It’s a weird combination of
fatalism and optimism. They accept they will fail, but things will work
out anyway.

The fact is, things can and will get much worse, perhaps
catastrophically worse, if the current ruling elite is not reformed or
replaced. <a

is a good example of just how rotten the ruling elite is now. Notice the
use of the word stalemate when describing the current situation. While
technically true, the fact is most Americans would be fin with ending
all immigration. The only reason this is a topic is the Left wants to
flood the nation with non-white immigrants. The stalemate is really an
assault.

It is considered an inevitability that 30 million Mexican peasants will
be granted citizenship, despite not going through the regular process.
It is just a matter of getting passed this pesky “stalemate” business.
It is also assumed that the number of legal immigrants will be increased
to some number just below whatever the Left wants. In other words, to
the people in charge, a stalemate is really just an interregnum or a
pause in the steady march toward whatever the Left wants. They know they
will eventually win. They are right.
