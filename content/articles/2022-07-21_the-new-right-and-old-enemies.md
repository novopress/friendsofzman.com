From a dissident perspective, the squabbles between the professional
conservatives and their critics in what they are calling the New Right
is like see something of a proof of dissident critiques of conservatism.
Many of the charges levelled at the professional conservatives are
borrowed, without attribution, from dissidents. The main charge, that
conservatives have conserved nothing, was a mainstay of dissident
discussion before Trump arrived to discredit the conservative
establishment.

The term “New Right” itself is borrowed from the old alt-right. Back in
2016 when the alt-right was morphing into old school white nationalism,
those not interested in going in that direction were labeled the
alt-light. Guys like Mike Cernovich and Jack Posobic started calling
their thing the New Right as a way to add legitimacy to their activity
on social media. Sohrab Ahmari appropriated the term and uses it to
describe those criticizing institutional conservatism.

Putting that aside, the back and forth between various groups is useful
in understanding what happened with American conservatism. If there is
going to be some new force that rises up to challenge the status quo, it
will need to avoid the errors made by conservatives in the last century.
The debate also provides an avenue for understanding the much larger
trends that have led to this point. Ideas matter and it is the ebb and
flow of ideas that animates history.

This <a href="https://americanmind.org/salvo/reductio-ad-hitlerlum/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> in the Claremont publication
American Mind by Michael Anton is a good example of how ideas shape
actions. Anton is responding to this <a
href="https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2022/06/13/carl-schmitts-disappointing-american-disciples/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> by someone calling himself
<a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/author/mike-watson/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Michael Watson</a>. Those old enough to
recall the purging of the paleocons by the National Review crowd will
recognize the pattern. Instead of addressing the criticism coming from
their right, the conservatives accuse the critics of being anti-Semitic
and thus disqualified from the debate.

For his part, Anton responds in the predictable way. He endorses the
central claim that any criticism of certain people is off limits, thus
his job is to prove that his ideas do not fall into that bucket. The
paleos went down this road back in the 1980’s when they insisted that
criticizing Israel and Israeli influence in American foreign policy was
not an attack on Jews. The neocons were undeterred and paid off enough
conservatives, primarily Bill Buckley, to make the charge stick.

For those interested, Bill Buckley produced a special edition of
National Review to condemn the paleos. He then turned it into a <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Search-Anti-Semitism-William-F-Buckley/dp/0826405835"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">book</a>. No doubt that American
Enterprise, Heritage and other conservative money machines bought skids
of the book as a reward for his efforts. Here is a <a
href="https://www.wrmea.org/1992-february/what-they-said-israel-and-its-amen-corner.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">transcript</a> of Buchanan being
interviewed on PBS about the charges levelled against him. Thirty years
on and we see the same tricks being used by institutional conservatism
to guard their right.

Interestingly, Anton makes no mention of the fact that Watson is a
member of the neoconservatism cult. He is the associate director of the
Center for the Future of Liberal Society at the Hudson Institute. For
those interested in the deep state theory of everything, their
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Institute" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">wiki page</a> is a cornucopia of material. For those
interested in anti-Semitism, it reads like something from Kevin
MacDonald. It is a good example of how relentless pursuit of group
interest can easily look like conspiracy.

Anton has his reasons for avoiding the elephant in the room, but the
elephant is at the heart of the debate. Neoconservatism has never made
any sense as a subset of Anglo-Conservatism, as its primary focus is
international. Conservatism is the elevation of the near over the far,
the local over the distant. The singular focus of neoconservatism is the
ancient enemies of the Jewish people, both near and far. Given the lack
of anti-Semites locally, it is obsessed with distant enemies from the
past.

The temptation is to hang all of this on the Jews, but the fact is
neoconservatism has become a weird subculture that revolves around the
concept of Israel. Many of the biggest neocons are not Jewish. Watson is
obviously not Jewish. Bill Buckley was obviously not Jewish. Large
swaths of the Evangelical subculture are obsessed with supporting Israel
at the expense of everything. Since the Cold War, this subculture has
driven conservative politics, right into oblivion.

For this reason, it is easy to see why many on the so-called New Right
are loath to take on the neocons. They have a lot of money and they lack
a soul. They will say the nastiest things about anyone who crosses them.
Taking on a well-heeled collection of sociopaths with institutional
power is dangerous. The trouble is, there is no air for a “new right”
until the Right is purged of this pestilence. Neoconservatism has to be
read out of politics in general, not just right-wing politics.

There are plenty of easy targets in the neocon space. Thirty years ago,
neoconservatism was run by smart and clever men. Today it is populated
with cranks and crazies who are easy to mock. More important, their
schemes have resulted in an evolving economic and political disaster.
Pinning the economic war against Russia on the neocons is easy money.
The New Right would be wise to borrow a trick from Saul Alinsky and make
the neocons own the Ukraine disaster.

Of course, this comes to the other elephant in the room. Conservatism is
a business and the neocons have a near lock on the flow of money. They
control the billion-dollar think tank racket. They control access to big
donors. The reason that *First Things* continues to publish a nut job
like [George
Weigel](https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2022/07/the-lessons-of-russian-warmaking)
is money. His war mongering lunacy and bigotry is out of step with the
site, but institutional conservatism likes him so he is tolerated in
order to avoid offending the money men.

The golden rule says that the man with the gold makes the rules and that
is the problem that any alternative to institutional conservatism faces.
Either it accepts poverty as the price for political commitment or it
builds a parallel funding mechanism. Whether or not the New Right
understands this is unclear. The only way to achieve the latter is to
take Alinsky’s advice and focus on the problem, personalize it and then
polarize it, forcing people to pick sides, thus neutralizing it.
