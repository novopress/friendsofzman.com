One of the features of every societal crisis is that the elites of the
society stop enforcing the rules of society, especially on themselves.
Prior to the collapse of the Roman Republic, the elites started making
exceptions to the rules. In the short term they seemed practical, but in
the long term these exceptions undermined the moral logic of the rules
entirely. Before long, a man in Gaul could decide that the rules no
longer applied and he was free to do as he pleased.

This is at the core of the current crisis in the American empire. The
rules have become arbitrary with regards to the elite. In turn the
elites no longer enforce basic principles that are the foundation of the
country. One of the principles is property. It used to be understood
that you own the produce of your labor. That was the default and
infringement on your ownership had to clear a high bar. Today, the
powerful can steal your property without consequence.

This collapse of property rights is at the core of this <a
href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/florida-senator-extorted-nude-photos-looks-sex-crime"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">story</a> out of Florida about a law
banning theft of private images. A local politician says nude photos of
her were stolen and distributed on-line without her consent. She is
leading the charge to change the law regarding ownership of your image.
She is also doing the rounds to draw attention to herself, but also
raise awareness of the issue. She thinks there should be federal law to
protect ownership of your image.

In truth, it used to be understood that you own you and therefore you
own whatever you produce, including your image. Forty years ago, a
television show maker would have to get a signed release to use footage
of you walking down a city street. They did not have to pay you, but you
did not have to grant them permission. Today, your image can be freely
distributed on-line and you have no recourse. Similarly, your activity
on-line can be used by others and you can do nothing about it.

Reasserting property rights to include things like your image, your
internet activity, your resume and other non-tangible products of your
labor would go a long way to restoring order to society. One reason for
that is it would torpedo the business model of the tech monopolies, who
rely on your free labor to make a profit. What Facebook calls ad revenue
is actually the sale of user activity and content. They sell this data
in bulk to marketers, government and corporate interests.

If Facebook had to get a signed release from you every time they sell
your data their business model would collapse in a month. Their margins
would collapse even if their user were okay with being exploited this
way, because the cost of this model would be shifted back onto their
balance sheet. The same is true of the other big socials. All of them
would have to rethink their business model. This would most likely take
place in bankruptcy court as there is no easy answer for them.

Of course, for this to work it would require the return of the old model
for enforcing contracts, especially contracts of adhesion or one-way
contracts. That is what the terms of service is called in the law. It is
a take it leave it offer. These sorts of contracts used to come under
careful scrutiny by the courts. The reason is they saw a powerful
interest issuing terms to weak interests, so the way to level the
playing field was the court would act on behalf of the weak interest.

The reason that the back of car rental contracts all look the same is
they went through the legal process over many years. That standard
language has been approved by the courts and will therefore be enforced
by the courts. That means the car rental firm does not willy-nilly
change the language during your rental. The same process has been
applied to residential leases and utility contracts. The same legal
standards should be applied to terms of service agreements.

A world where the big social media players have to get permission to
alter their terms of service and those terms have to be legally clear
and concise, is a world where they cannot abuse their authority. They go
back to being passive service providers, rather than arbiters of truth.
In a world where they have to respect your property rights, they revert
back to a traditional business that offers a service in exchange for a
fee, rather than a monopoly with socialized costs.

Of course, to return to a rule-based world requires Congress and the
courts to rediscover the rule of law and the advantages of an orderly
society. That would require them to suddenly get the courage and
morality to turn down the massive bribes that flow into Washington from
the tech firms. The great lesson Silicon Valley learned during the
Microsoft antitrust case is that everyone in Washington comes with a
price tag and there is always a sale going on in Washington.

An old adage about money is that if you need hard money to control your
corrupt elites, your corrupt elites will find a way around hard money.
This axiom of history applies to the law as well. if you need to codify
the basics of a civilized society in order to control your elites, those
elites will get around the laws of civilized society. That is the
fundamental problem in America. Unless and until the elites are replaced
with and by a moral people, the chaos will continue until collapse.
