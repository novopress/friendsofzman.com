The foundation of western style liberalism is that the law applies to
everyone equally and the law operates by a certain logic. A citizen does
not have to memorize the laws in order to avoid violating them. The
represents the habit of mind of the people. That’s the ideal and there
are exceptions, but the general concept is what matters. The further
away from the ideals, the more corrupt the society. <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">You see that here</a>.

*The United States Patent and Trademark Office canceled six federal
trademark registrations for the NFL’s Washington Redskins on Wednesday,
saying the nickname is “disparaging to Native Americans” and cannot be
trademarked under federal law that prohibits trademark protection on
offensive or disparaging language.*

*The team has been under fire for the past year, with many groups,
including the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation, wanting the nickname changed.*

*Last month, the team hired a lobbying firm to help with the
public backlash after senators sent a letter to the National Football
League saying they also wanted the name changed.*

* “We decide, based on the evidence properly before us, that these
registrations must be cancelled because they were disparaging to Native
Americans at the respective times they were registered,” the Trademark
Trial and Appeals board wrote in its opinion.*

*Redskins owner Dan Snyder has repeatedly said that he will not change
the nickname despite the opposition.*

*The Trademark Trial and Appeals Board said the “Redskins” name is the
subject for cancellation for “entertainment services -namely, football
exhibitions rendered in stadia and through the media of radio and
television broadcasts.”*

*The team’s cheerleading squad, the “Redskinettes,” are also subject to
the cancellation, for “entertainment services, namely, cheerleaders who
perform dance routines at professional football games and exhibitions
and other personal appearances,” according to the board.*

This jihad against the Redskins is led by one of the most corrupt humans
on earth, Harry Reid (D, Organized Crime). This is a man who entered
politics penniless and is now super-rich. He made his money shaking
down contributors and making land deals with organized crime figures.
Dan Snyder may be an odious speck of a man, but he made his money
honestly. He has a right to live in a land of laws and he has right to
expect those laws will be respected by his government.

This is a national disgrace. Whatever your views on the name or the
people involved in the dispute, willy-nilly stealing the owner’s
property for political reasons is how banana republics function. What’s
next? Will Reid send in thugs to break up Snyder’s house and threaten
his family? We have allowed our country to be taken over by criminals,
deviants and lunatics. We should be ashamed of what we have done.
