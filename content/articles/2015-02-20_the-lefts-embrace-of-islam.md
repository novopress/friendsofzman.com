Belief is a funny thing. I can go to bed thinking my team won the game,
despite having gone to be before it ended, and wake up to learn they
blew it and lost. In other words, I can *think* one thing and suddenly
*think* the opposite once new information is presented. I used to think
BMW’s were great cars until I drove one. I still think they are great
cars, but just not for me.  In other words, even in areas of taste, the
rational part of our brain works from facts and experience. New
information results in new patterns of thought.

That’s not how it works with beliefs. I know very smart people who are
also devout Christians. They believe God created the heavens and earth.
They believe God created man in his image. Evolution, as far as they are
concerned is a nice hobby, but not science and mostly nonsense. They
simply don’t believe any of it and no amount of data or experience can
shake that belief. It’s why I seldom engage in debate with ID’ers. You
can’t argue about belief as belief is immune to facts and reason.
Therefore, there can be no debate.

The thing about faith and belief is you can fake belief to a point, but
you can’t fake *disbelief*. You see that on-line when liberal sock
puppets post on conservative sites. They try really hard to pretend to
be down with the issue, but they just can’t stop themselves from
inserting exceptions. The best example I recall is the fake Jon Huntsman
supporters from the fever swamp showing up in the comment sections. They
would swear they were “right-wing conservatives” and then launch into
what was essentially a liberal fantasy about Jon Huntsman. They simply
could not maintain the facade. Their belief was too strong.

Faith is a biological thing. It is thought that belief as a human trait
co-evolved with language. That makes it one of our oldest traits.
Religion is a part of every human society that has existed. There are no
records of any society devoid of some form of religious faith. It’s why
when people say America or the West is becoming less religious, they are
mistaken. Less Christian for sure, but the believing trait is still
there in the same degree. It is just expressed differently. The
political and social ideologies of the West now serve as the vessel for
the religious impulse. As Rousseau called it in the Social Contract, the
West now has the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_religion" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Civil Religion</a>.

If you have been reading my stuff, you know I’m fond of calling American
Liberalism a cult. It operates like a cult, even having a
<span class="st" hveid="40">*Führerprinzip*</span>. It’s temporary and
tied to the democratic processes, but the dynamic is the same. Obama is
the cult leader now, but will soon be replaced by whoever runs for
president on the 2016 ticket. Obama worship will continue, but his
leadership role of the one true faith will be handed to another. It’s
not an accident that their heroes are all referred to by three letters,
FDR, JFK, MLK, RFK, BHO. Bill Clinton is about to be demoted simply
because no one calls him by his initials anymore.

So, where am I going with this?

<a
href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/414116/nothing-see-here-nothing-all-jonah-goldberg"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">This post by Jonah Goldberg</a> got me
thinking about what’s happening with the Left and Islam. Since Rousseau,
radicals have had a loathing for Christianity. It has always been the
big scary monster in their myths and legends. Today, they fret more
about Bible-toting grannies in the South than <a
href="http://www.salon.com/2013/04/22/are_the_tsarnaev_brothers_white/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">bomb wielding Muslims</a> in their own
backyard. If you put “Christian backlash” in a Google machine, it
returns over 8 million results. The phase “Muslim backlash” nets 1.7
million results, most about anti-Muslim backlash by Christians.

As an aside, you’ll note how they changed Reverend Martin Luther King
into Doctor Martin Luther King. There’s never any mention of his faith.
The same is true about the early Progressives of the the late 19th and
early 20th century. There’s no mention of the fact that early
Progressives claimed Christ as their source of legitimacy. The
Temperance Movement, for example, is now cast a bunch of crazy church
ladies, rather than progressive reformers. For the modern Left,
Christianity is now beyond the pale, as unacceptable as racism or
antisemitism.

This derangement is evident in the Obama administrations biological
aversion to mentioning Islam in the context of the barbarism we are
seeing in the Near East. Their refusal to accept a link between attacks
on Jews in Europe and the fact the attackers are all Muslim has become a
sick comedy. Obama was on television the other day complaining about the
Crusdades, as if we have a problem with terrorism from the Knights
Templar. As laughable as it is, they can’t seem to stop themselves. As I
said, belief is a visceral thing. It’s biological. The modern Left has
somehow come to *believe* that Islam is their soul mate in some way.

This bit from the Goldberg column is a good example:

Kerry is repeating a line common on the Left. It is the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">No True Scotsman</a> fallacy. In this case, Kerry is
saying no *true* religion advocates murder. That’s nonsense, of course,
which is why it is a fallacy. Now, if you are a fan of esoteric writing,
you can argue he is telling the flock that Islam is not behind these
acts and it is just propaganda blaming innocent Muslims. After all, not
true Muslim advocates terrorism so it must be something else at work,
like easy access to guns or racism.

That’s how Muslims hear it and I suspect that’s the true intention here.
Kerry is clodhopper so I doubt he wrote the essay. It sounded nice so he
signed off on it. The people who wrote it and the many speeches of Obama
on the topic are true believers like Obama. They see in Islam a natural
ally and therefore cannot bring themselves to acknowledge the obvious.
There was a time when it was polite to avoid pointing out the link, in
the hope that more sensible Muslims in the Middle East would deal with
these lunatics. We’re well beyond that so it makes no sense to pretend
Islam is not at the heart of ISIS, for example.

Still, the Left is embracing Islam and that’s no small thing. I’ve often
wrote that modern progressive thought looks a lot like Islam. The
anti-rationalism, the mysticism and the occasionalism are there in both
groups. It’s a one way love affair, of course, but the Left’s deep
hatred for Christians appears to have pushed them into an emotional
partnership with the barbarians beyond the edge of civilization. For
this generation of Western radicals, ISIS is the Black Panther Party of
their parents generation.
