During World War II, there was a great debate among the Allies about the
use of bombing raids against German cities. Collateral damage was the
concern. The Germans built their munitions plants near population
centers. There were those in the high command who said that if the
Allies used aerial bombardment against these facilities, then they would
be no better than the Germans. It would be much better to maintain their
principles and lose than win and be judged as morally equal or even
similar as the Germans.

Of course, that never happened. There was some debate about the morality
of certain tactics, but only in so far as they would result in
retaliation. That was the lesson of the Great War. The use of poison
gas, for example, just resulted in the use of gas by the other side. As
Greg Cochran pointed out,
<a href="https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2012/02/02/war-in-the-east/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Soviets may have resorted to germ
warfare against the Germans</a>, but fear of retaliation certainly
shaped their thinking. If they used biological agents, it was out of
desperation and covered up after the fact.

The point here is that in war, the first priority, the overriding
priority, is winning. You do that first and worry about morality later.
Principles are the things the winners create after they have secured
victory. Principles are the way in which the winners consolidate their
gains after victory in a war. Imagine if the Civil War had gone the
other way and the South had won. Would anyone today tremble at the
accusation of racism? Obviously not, because the victors would have had
no reason to make racism a mortal sin.

The obsession with principle has always been the central defect of what
the kids now call “Boomer Conservatism.” The BoomerCons accept, without
argument, the principles and moral framework of the Left and then they
try to out-righteous the other side in a pointless game of virtue
signalling. It is the basis of the DR3 meme. Even if you are able to
“prove” that the “Democrats are the real racists,” all you have done is
prove they are right and that racism is the worst thing ever. Even if
you win, you end up losing.

And yes, I know, not all Boomers think like this and
<a href="https://twitter.com/ColumbiaBugle/status/879038127444250625"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">many younger people fall into the same
trap</a>. Lots of young people like the Rolling Stones and The Who, but
it is still Boomer music. The cultural upheavals going on today are due
to the cultural upheavals that went on yesterday, when the Boomers
tossed over the culture they inherited and created the prevailing
orthodoxy of today. All of us now live in Boomer Land, which means we
live in the moral structure created by the Boomer generation.

Now, the folks with the tricorn hats and “heritage not hate” signs can
be forgiven for not seeing the folly of their tactics. They came of age
when the general consensus said that the goal is a color blind society.
If the bad honkies would just open up their hearts to the black man, all
the race stuff would melt away. It was all nonsense, but a whole
generation was raised on it and now they struggle to let it go. For most
Boomers, egalitarianism is their heritage, so it is understandable that
they cling to it.

Of course, the libertarian boomers have turned their love of principle
into a ready excuse for not getting into a serious fight with the Left.
You see it in <a

Well, that’s how culture wars work. Each side tries to impose their
cultural preferences on the other. If you are in opposition to the
prevailing culture then what you seek, by definition, is an unraveling
of the culture. That’s how you win. Otherwise, you confine yourself to
tactics that will never work. For guys like
<a href="http://www.toddseavey.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Todd
Seavey</a>, principle is a coffin they think will give them comfort as
the Left lowers them into the grave.

Again, the Boomer generation can be forgiven for clinging to their
principles even if it means defeat. They came into an America that was
the colossus, standing astride the world as the defender of freedom and
the exponent of economic prosperity. The principles they inherited were
cooked up by people who conquered the world. America in the 50’s and
60’s was a society that was sure it had things figured out. If you were
ten years old in the early 60’s, truth, justice and the American way
made perfect sense.

The last fifty years, however, have proven to be a cultural disaster for
America, one that will have to be addressed by the coming generations.
In order for that to happen, a counter culture must form that is willing
to be called unprincipled as they rush the stage or shout down the
people with the megaphones. What ponytails and recreational drugs were
for the Boomers, fashy haircuts and race realism will be for the next
generations. The young who are rebelling are rebelling against those
vaunted principles the Boomers cherish.

The only way a counter culture gets any traction is if it is
indifferent, or even hostile, to the prevailing morality. There are two
types of principles a people live by. There are those that precede their
demise and those they create after they triumph. The people desperately
clinging to their principles, lecturing those willing to do what it
takes to win, will be buried with those principles. The winners,
meanwhile, will be busy crafting a new morality. That’s the lesson of
history. The people with a future get to write the past.
