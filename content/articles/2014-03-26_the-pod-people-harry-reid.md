I’m fond of calling our ruling class Pod People. They look like us and
make sounds that seem human, but they are nothing like us. It’s a take
off of the gag used in the movie The Live. The aliens use some sort of
technology to disguise their presence. To humans, the aliens look like
humans, just very successful. That’s the way our world feels these days.

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Here’s a good example from
Hairy Reed</a>.

*Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) said the fault of
struggling to sign up on the Obamacare exchanges didn’t lie with the
faulty website, but with the people who weren’t “educated on how to use
the Internet.”Explaining the reasoning behind the latest Obamacare
delay, Reid said too many people just didn’t know to use their computer
properly and needed more time. Apparently, it had nothing to do with the
well-documented failings of the website that have embarrassed the White
House for months.*

*“We have hundreds of thousands of people who tried to sign up who
didn’t get through,” he said. “There are some people who are not like my
grandchildren who can handle everything so easily on the Internet, and
these people need a little extra time. It’s not — the example they gave
us is a 63-year-old woman came into the store and said, ‘I almost got
it. Every time I just about got there, it would cut me off.’ We have a
lot of people just like this through no fault of the Internet, but
because people are not educated on how to use the Internet.”*

*It’s just the latest strange moment for the embattled Reid, who’s
facing an increasingly uphill battle to keep a majority of Democrats in
the Senate. Reid also recently implied all Americans telling their
stories of Obamacare’s harmful effects were liars, and he has
incessantly bashed the Koch Brothers as “un-American” and “against
everything that’s good for America.”*

*Unfortunately for Reid, he has a far higher negative rating with the
public than the Kochs.*

Back in the 1990’s I used to get a kick out of reading legacy media talk
about the Internet. Watching them fumble on TV with the basics was great
theater. The strange thing about our elites is they are always late to
the game, but then pretend to be experts long after most people take the
“new thing” for granted. The Internet is a good example, as the people
in charge were the last adopters., but now they demand the right to
regulate it as the experts on the subject.
