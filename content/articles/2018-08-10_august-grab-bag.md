I’ve been very busy with the day job this week, so putting together a
thematic show was not in the cards. Those take a little more time and
 thought. The last part is the important part, as I actually have to
think about what I’m going to say, rather than just wing it. There’s
also the the miscellaneous stuff I want to gas on about, that does not
fit a general theme. I think once a month I’ll do a show that is just a
grab bag of miscellaneous items that strike my fancy. That provides a
little head room, as far as my schedule.

I’ve also been in a foul mood this week. The endless gaslighting by the
media has its effects, even when you know it is happening. It’s harder
for me to think when I’m full of rage, so a week to blow off a little
steam is useful. Given that traffic is way up here of late, I suspect
I’m not alone in feeling the rage. Something is happening. A post here
got 300 comments the other day. That never happens. J’Onquarious tells
me his traffic is way up too. Maybe it’s those Russian trolls I keep
hearing so much about.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I’m now on
Spotify, so the millennials can tune in when not sobbing over white
privilege and toxic masculinity.
