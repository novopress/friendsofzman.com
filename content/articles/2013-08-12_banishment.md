rel="noopener" target="_blank">This story is a cornucopia of crazy</a>.
For starters, the guy who was arrested is obviously a complete loon. It
is one thing to wave around a rebel flag. It is another to do so in the
middle of a Camden street, yelling at black people. The Confederate flag
stuff is just anti-white agit-prop. That said, the South did lose the
war. Why would anyone adopt the symbols the losing side?  In all other
times and places, people hold up their losers as objects of derision or
simply ignore them. People celebrate winners, not losers.

For some reason racist rednecks went the other way. In fairness, lots of
Southerners simply see the Rebel flag as part of their heritage and
culture. The racist goofballs simply hijacked the symbol. Putting that
aside, the fact that this racist redneck is from Pennsylvania, a
northern state, makes it even funnier to me. Maybe he is from Alabama
originally, but I doubt it. The story strongly suggests that this guy is
just an idiot.

The truly scary part of the story the crime. Camden apparently has a law
against thinking bad things about black people. Or, maybe it is a law
against saying bad things about black people. Interestingly, Camden is
17.59% (13,602) white, 48.07% (37,180) black and 47.04% (36,379)
Hispanic, according to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden,_New_Jersey" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Wiki</a>. That’s mathematically impossible so I’m going
to assume a lot of “white Hispanics” in those numbers. Either way, it is
more Latin than I would have expected. I wonder if the Latins know about
this magic black guy law

Of course, the Hispanic presence may be the root of the law. Blacks hate
whites, but they fear Hispanics. Once the brown guys start moving ion,
the black guys start moving out and not always by choice. The crime rate
is sky high and Camden is considered one of the ten most dangerous
places in America.  I’m thinking these hate crime laws are a tribal
thing. The in group makes laws to protect them from the new arrivals.

The best bit is what the city is planning for this knucklehead. They
intend to banish him from the city. That’s a pretty good punishment. I
wish we did more of this. It is not easy in a nation of 300 million to
house all of our criminals. Banishment would solve the problem of prison
over-crowding. Instead of just barring this dope from Camden, how about
shipping him off to a penal colony? It would be cheaper and pretty good
deterrent.
