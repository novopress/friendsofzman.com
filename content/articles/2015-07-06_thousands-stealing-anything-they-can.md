The TSA was started by the execrable George Bush in response to the 9/11
terrorist attack. The theory behind hiring low-IQ dimwits to stand
around the nation’s airports was that, by sheer numbers, they would root
out and expose terror attacks. It is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Infinite Monkey Theorem</a> applied to
national security.  So we now have a million monkeys in blue shirts
hassling everyone at the airport.

The result has been what you expect when you take people choosing
between a life of low-level crime and life on the dole and give them
access to private property.

baseball icon Don Zimmer</a>.

*The widow of a baseball icon was heartbroken Friday night over a
missing jersey that she believes was stolen.*

*Last month, the Yankees gave Soot Zimmer a jersey in honor of her late
husband, Don Zimmer, who served as bench coach for the team for several
years.*

*But the jersey never made it back to Florida with Soot Zimmer, and she
thinks a Transportation Security Administration agent stole it from her
luggage .*

*“When it was missing out of the luggage when we got home , it wasn’t
the monetary value, it was the sentimental,” she said. “You know, they
gave me that to represent Don, and now I didn’t have it.”*

*Luckily for Soot, her husband’s original jersey is framed in her home.*

Every year the TSA settles tens of thousands of cases where employees
have stolen property from bags or damaged property trying to steal it.
Millions of dollars in claims are settled each year. If the TSA were run
by Italians, the Feds would hit them with a RICO charge.

But, this is government and as Reagan said, the closest thing to
immortality is a government program. The TSA is a great example of the
ratchet effect at work. It will never go away. It will only grow every
year. The theft of private good will eventually be viewed as a cost of
travel. After the next terror attack, a new department will be created
on top of the TSA and it will grow like a fungus too.

At some point, the whole thing grinds to a halt.
