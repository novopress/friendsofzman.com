An interesting subtext to the election of Donald Trump is one that has
been largely ignored by the usual sources. It was not cultural issues,
foreign policy or the ineptitude of Kamala Harris that drove the
election. It was the economy. Widespread anxiety over the economy is
what drove down support for Harris, despite the billion-dollar campaign
and the billions spent in media gaslighting. No amount of jawboning
could convince the public that the economy is doing as good as claimed.

There is a good reason for this. As some have predicted, inflation has
been creeping back up after having moved down for a period. The American
economy is experiencing what happened in the 1970’s. Contrary to popular
belief, inflation did not rage for the entire decade but ran in spurts.
There were periods where inflation rose, plateaued and then fell to a
tolerable level. The latest data on the <a
href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/11/cpi-inflation-november-2024-annual-inflation-rate-accelerates-to-2point7percent-in-november-as-expected.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">CPI</a> and the
<a href="https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1867202075102204303"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">PPI</a> indicate the current economy is
stuck in a similar pattern.

Regime media dismisses this as a minor blip in an otherwise glorious
economy, managed by the wise and noble Biden administration, but that
has not convinced anyone who buys things. The government does not
measure inflation the same way it used to measure it in the 1970’s, so
no talk of stagflation. If they used the old
<a href="https://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">methods</a>, inflation would be a daily
feature. Of course, you also have the fact that the government now <a
href="https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/biden-lied-about-everything-philly-fed-finds-all-jobs-created-q2-were-fake"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">lies</a> about all of the economic data.

This is why the gaslighting failed so miserably in the election. One of
the secrets to trick people is to overcome the expectations gap. This is
the difference between what people expect to be the basis of the
argument and the actual basis of the argument. If you confirm what
people think is true and make your argument from that basis, you can
convince people of most anything. If you start from an alternative
reality as your basis, then you have little chance, no matter how clever
the argument.

That does not alter the fact that the economy may be in worse shape than
the government and media are willing to admit. There are systemic
problems that go back a long way that may finally being coming to the
fore. Twenty years ago, everyone talked about what would happen to the
labor force when the baby boomers started to retire, but no one talks
about it now that they are retiring. Of course, no one dares talk about
is replacing those baby boomers in the workplace.

For his part, Trump talks about the need to reform the economic model
away from everyone doing each other’s laundry back to building things
again. Part of his approach to China is to bring back important parts of
the industrial base. Trump is committed to a form of Abenomics which
means massive new spending to attract private capital, along with
policies to coerce those investments. He will come to office just as
government spending is setting new <a
href="https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/government-spending-shock-us-budget-deficit-worst-start-year-record"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">records</a>.

This sort of worked in Japan because they have a strong industrial base
that supports their export economy. They also have a homogenous culture
with a commitment to self-sufficiency and a savings rate to prove it.
For America, this can only work with low interest rates and that can
only happen if the dollar returns to its dominant position in global
trade and investment. It is why Trump is threatening to nuke any country
thinking about going off the dollar.

The trouble is, people will trade in a currency if it is backed by
something accepted everywhere like gold or the issuing country produces
things that the rest of the world covets, like food, manufactured goods
and energy. Alternatively, as has been the case for decades, countries
will transact in a currency if it is viewed as a stable store of value
by the rest of the world. The dollar has been the reserve currency
because of the petrodollar and because it came with a stable set of
rules.

Constant rule breaking by Washington has depressed the trust in the
dollar because the rules behind it have collapsed. The only reason that
the BRICS countries are working on an alternative payment system is they
fear dependence on the dollar makes their governments unstable. Added to
this is the fact that the Saudis have not renewed the petrodollar
agreement signed in the 1970’s. This has not resulted in a change in
policy, but China just
<a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202411/1323517.shtml"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">sold</a> dollar-denominated bonds in
Riyadh.

This is one reason the foreign policy establishment is committed to
creating chaos in the Middle East. The United States is not just the
world’s banker. It is also the world’s protection racket and the
countries that need protection the most are those near places with lots
of instability. You can be sure that the collapse of Syria is keeping
the sheiks in Riyadh tossing and turning at night. Here you see the
connection between foreign policy and economic policy. In the end, it is
always about money.

This is what Trump will inherit next month. On the one hand, the
economic model of the American empire relies on the world being a
dangerous place. This is what makes the world willing to put up with
Washington in exchange for protection. At the same time, that model is
slowly hollowing out the American middle-class. The imperial model works
just fine if American citizens accept being mere subjects alongside the
rest of the world’s population. Clearly they do not like this.

To some degree you can understand why permanent Washington has reacted
to Trump and the populist movement that has made him possible with such
fear. They understand the risks that come with putting the American
people first. It is not just the cultural stuff or the paranoid fear of
the past. It is the understanding that the imperial economic system
cannot prioritize Americans over the others getting protection.
Protection rackets must protect everyone inside the racket.

Whether or not Trump understands this is a mystery, but he is committed
to an American form of Abenomics. It was not an accident that he <a
href="https://www.barrons.com/news/trump-hosts-shinzo-abe-s-widow-at-mar-a-lago-d686b1d5"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">hosted</a> Abe’s widow last week at
Mar-a-Lago. Scott Bessent, Trump’s pick to run Treasury, is known as
“The Man Who Broke the Bank of Japan” because his hedge fund made
billions from Abenomics by understanding it in great detail. Whether it
can work in America is unknown, but we will know soon enough.

That is the irony of the Trump election. He was elected in large part to
fix the economy, by which people mean lower inflation and increase
wages. Republicans have done this with tax cuts and corporate giveaways
and Democrats have done it with spending programs and corporate
giveaways. The Trump plan is to restructure the economy, which will
require massive spending and a considerable amount of pain. It is a
radical departure from what people have come to expect.
