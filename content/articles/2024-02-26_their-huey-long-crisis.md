Former President Trump won the South Carolina primary on Saturday,
clobbering Nikki Haley by twenty points. Haley, of course, was the
governor of the state and pitched herself as the local favorite. Despite
all evidence to the contrary, the anti-Trump elements in the Republican
ecosystem thought Haley had a chance to upset Trump in her home state
and thus bring about the collapse of Trump. Instead, Saturday should be
the end of the Haley campaign.

Whether or not Haley drops out of the race is an open question. The Koch
network announced they would stop funding this ridiculous project in
order to focus on other ridiculous projects. Typically, this sort of
announcement is a signal to the rest of the donors and the media that
the project is finished. The usual suspects, however, never abandon a
project. They still think we should have troops in Iraq in order to
spread democracy, so they will stick with Haley.

Nevertheless, the attention will now shift from Haley to the prospect of
Trump securing the nomination and what can be done to stop it. That last
part is the important part, as the usual suspects never accept defeat.
Paul Ramsey has a short
<a href="https://youtu.be/W1nz7jFj0G8?si=UFKSHPH0ZmP3W6jV"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">video</a> up explaining the various
lawfare shenanigans they have ready to stop Trump. What lies ahead now
is not the normal progress toward the candidate securing the nomination,
but a series a political witch trials intended to jail an opposition
candidate.

Because the courts are thoroughly politicized now and controlled by the
regime, there is no question about the results. Trump will be convicted
in all of them, probably before the end of the year. Some convictions
will come before the November elections, as the regime thinks this will
sink Trump in the polls. Alternatively, it will force the Republican
party to remove Trump from the ballot. Nothing says democracy like
removing the opposition candidate from the ballot.

As an aside, you have to admire the cynicism of the people who think
these cases will erode Trump’s support. Their starting point is the
assumption that Trump voters respect the system and have high enough
moral standards that they would not support a man convicted by the
system. Therefore, if the usual suspects can rig a few court cases
against Trump, these decent people will be tricked into dropping their
support for the enemy of the tricksters and go along with the trickster
option.

Putting that aside, as Paul Ramsey notes in his video, we are heading
toward a crisis that is without parallel in our history. Trump will be
facing prison time, but either have the nomination or have the delegates
to secure the nomination. That and he will be the favorite to win the
general election, assuming the general election is not as corrupt as it
was the last time. What we have seen thus far is Trump will not quit and
his support will not drop due to the lawfare shenanigans.

A systemic crisis is when the options available within the system to the
people in charge of the system are all viewed as unacceptable. In this
case, the Republican Party can be forced to break its rules and remove
Trump. This is not just the death of the party, but the death of the
Potemkin opposition the regime requires. They can put Trump in jail and
hope he loses, but that makes him a martyr. They can call off the dogs,
but that means admitting it was all a lie from the start.

The thing that political insiders see that regime media is not allowed
to admit is that Trump is probably gaining in popularity. South Carolina
is an open system, so Democrats were free to vote in the Republican
primary. The regime spent millions to get the black vote out to vote for
Haley. In other words, like New Hampshire this was closer to a general
election voting pool. Trump still crushed Haley, which suggests the TDS
card is no longer working as it did in 2020.

The closest we have in our past to what we see happening with Trump is
Eugene V. Debs, who was a socialist agitator a century ago. The Wilson
administration put him in jail for heresy, which they called “sedition”
at the time. Today they call it insurrection, but it is the same idea.
The obvious difference here is that Debs was not a popular national
figure like Donald Trump. Debs was a fringe character without much
sympathy from the public, even before his antiwar activities.

The irony here is the people rubbing their hands together and salivating
at the prospect of Trump behind bars just spent the last week carrying
on over the death of Alexi Navalny, as if he was the Gandhi of Russia.
In other words, they dream of doing to Trump what they accuse the
Russians of doing to Navalny. In fact, they accuse lots of enemy
governments of acting this way. It is a good reminder that these people
have no souls and therefore no conscience, so no sense of shame.

An important thing to keep in mind with all of this is that the people
leading the revolution at the top have drawn one lesson from the past.
That lesson is they can never relent until they reach their goal. They
see the failures of their past subversions as the result of a failure to
go all in on the project. It is why they never accept defeat and
continue to push forward against all evidence. We are seeing this with
Ukraine, where their response to failure is to double down.

What this tells us is the brewing crisis over the Trump nomination will
not frighten the people responsible for it into finding a way out of it.
Instead, they will no doubt see it as an opportunity for even more
lawless shenanigans. The New Hampshire results had them double down on
South Carolina. The South Carolina failure will have them go all in on
the lawfare schemes. If those fail then one can only imagine what comes
next, but they no doubt have
