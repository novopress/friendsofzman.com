Just when you thought it was safe, after the Mueller testimony was a
colossal flop, President Trump finds a way to get everyone outraged all
over again. <a
href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/454995-trump-slams-cummings-as-a-brutal-bully-claims-baltimore-district-far"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">His tweets</a> about
Congressman Elijah Cummings and his congressional district, have all the
usual suspects pointing and sputtering. Given the amount of pointing and
sputtering they have had to do the last three years, it is a miracle
that they can even sputter. It should not be possible to be outraged for
three years, but here we are.

Of course, the usual suspects are howling about the racism, as Cummings
is black and his district is a black carve out. It includes some of the
worst parts of Baltimore city, which means the mostly black parts. The
district is about <a
href="https://www.biggestuscities.com/demographics/md/7th-congressional-district"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">30% white</a>, which is why
Cummings wins his elections with ease. <a
href="https://ballotpedia.org/Maryland%27s_7th_Congressional_District_election,_2018"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In 2018</a> he won with 76% of
the vote. If you are white and trapped in one of these districts, voting
is pointless. In fact, voting for anyone is pointless as the results are
known in advance.

As is custom with these types of districts, Cumming is as crooked as a
ram’s horn. His wife runs <a
href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/top-democrat-elijah-cummings-wife-may-have-gained-illegal-private-benefit-from-his-committee-activities"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a shady charity</a> that gets
millions from people with business in front the Congressman’s committee.
He also seems to have some connection with the recent scandal that
brought down the last mayor of Baltimore. In one of his tweets, Trump
mentioned the corruption. It should be pretty easy to run a sting on
Cummings, but he is off limits for the reason everyone knows, but does
not say.

Of course, no one will bother disputing the facts of Trump’s tweets.
That’s a dangerous subject that must never be mentioned. Any examination
of Baltimore would not only reveal Trump is right, but also reveal those
things we all know are true, but are told we must never mention.
Baltimore is a black city and the highest crime areas are the blackest
areas. For example, 92.9% of those arrested for murder are black and 91%
of their victims are black. Crime in Baltimore is a black thing.

Of course, this is something everyone knows to be true. In fact, no one
alive in modern America has ever lived in a time when people were
puzzled about the nature of crime, with regards to race. The reason the
urban hipsters exist is their hipster neighborhoods were ethnically
cleansed of non-whites, mostly blacks. Giuliani cleaned up Manhattan by
having the police put out the unwelcome mat for blacks. The stop and
frisk policy was a success, because it relied on those assumptions about
race and crime.

This link between race and crime is so well understood, efforts to
conceal it have become a meme on social media. For example, when the
news says they are looking for teens involved in a wilding incident,
everyone knows what it means. <a
href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/police-searching-teens-viciously-beat-men-washington-dc/story?id=64570303"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Here’s one</a> from
Washington. The same thing is true for the party shootings, which always
have a certain color to them. <a
href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/28/shooting-at-brooklyn-block-party-leaves-six-injured-one-dead/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Here’s one</a> from the
current news. Shootings at block parties are like shootings at hip-hop
concerts. Everyone knows what it means.

Of course, black crime is a young black male problem. When the Obama
Administration tried to make the case that the cops are racists, they
learned that the cops are probably not racist enough. In
<a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">their report on crime</a>,
they found that young black males are 3% of the population and near 30%
of homicides. Blacks were disproportionately represented as both
homicide victims and offenders. The offending rate for blacks (34.4 per
100,000) was almost 8 times higher than the rate for whites (4.5 per
100,000).

The fact is, crime in Baltimore, like everywhere in America, is a black
thing. The internent meme “1350” works because it is something everyone
knows, even if they don’t know the exact details. Even when the issue is
contained in certain sections of cities, people are made painfully aware
of this reality, because
<a href="http://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/hood.htm"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crime in the hood</a> does not
stay in the hood. Every white person in America has a story in their
family tree that involves leaving the old neighborhood because it went
bad.

That brings us back to Trump. In sane world, his noticing the obvious
should not be front page news, but we don’t live in a sane age. As
<a href="http://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">the legendary quantitative blogger</a> said long ago,
“There are very few moments in a man’s existence when he experiences so
much hostility, or meets with so little benevolence, as when he
challenges fashionable perceptions of race.” Trump is about to face a
fury of hostility from the usual suspects that no man has withstood in
the past.

In fact, <a
href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/455010-david-axelrod-slams-trump-attacks-on-cummings-baltimore-if-he-loses-in-2020"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of the usual suspects</a>
responsible for inflicting Barak Obama on the country is predicting that
this is the Gettysburg of his presidency. From the perspective of the
usual suspects, of course, Trump is Lee in this analogy. Like
Charlottesville, this event will be the rallying cry for the Left until
the election. Whatever other issues come up in the next year and a half,
the 2020 election will be about race, specifically the old Progressive
view of race versus one based in observable reality.

That is fundamentally the choice before us. Do we want to accept the
Progressive view on the human condition, slowly sinking into the
desperate, grinding poverty of a place like Baltimore? Or, we will not
accept that and do what is required to prevent America from becoming a
multicultural ghetto ruled by and parasitic elite? That’s what Baltimore
is right now. It is a vision of tomorrow that no one should welcome. It
does not have to be that way, but the only way to prevent it is to face
it.
