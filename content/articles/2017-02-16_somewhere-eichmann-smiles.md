When I was a teenager, abortion was one of the big issues in politics
and social policy. Bill Buckley used to say it was one of three issues
that told you everything about a man’s politics. It turns out he was
wrong about that, as so many of his tribe were pro-life for effect, as a
part of the Frank Meyer “fusionism” strategy. Putting that aside, for
normal people, abortion was the issue that defined you politically.
Liberals were pro-abortion and non-liberals were pro-life. The latter
emphasized the sanctity and uniqueness of each life while the former
rejected that entirely.

Here we are 30 years later and abortion is not much of an issue for our
politicians. There are some who make it a centerpiece of their politics,
but they are rare exceptions. The so-called conservatives that we see in
the commentariat wince when the topic is raised. You get the sense they
look at it like public professions of faith, something the Dirt People
still do, but unbecoming of a Cloud Person. They go through the motions,
as we will see with the court nominee, but the result will be that a
“conservative” judge will swear to never ever think about altering
abortion law.

The thing that the pro-life people never could accept is that the
pro-abortion people were never really pro-abortion, at least not as they
advertised it. Sure, the barren spinsters protesting in the streets for
a “woman’s right to choose” are pro-abortion, but they are the dull
witted shock troops of the Cult of Modern Liberalism, organized around
simple ideas in order to get them out in the streets making noise. The
women who were running around dressed as vaginas last month had no idea
why they were doing it. They just liked the drama and the attention.

The real core of the abortion movement is blank slate ideology, which
has become a foundation item for the Left. Since all humans are the same
at birth, the only thing society should care about is the number of live
births and the social structures for shaping and forming these amorphous
blobs as they come into the world. Babies born to mothers not “properly
trained” to be good citizens will not get the proper training so the
emphasis of the abortion movement has always been about making sure the
woman is “ready to be a mother” as if it is just another job within the
state.

Anyway, another example of how far and how fast we have moved away from
the idea that human life is unique and precious is <a

“Once unthinkable” basically means last week. In the Bush years, we had
big fights about the use of embryonic stem cells for use in experiments.
Now, we’re about to start experimenting on actual humans, without really
knowing the result. This is, of course, eugenics. The Cloud People will
not use the word, because they believe they killed that word and the bad
juju that comes with it, but that’s just the nature of magical thinking.
Once you step onto the path of designing humans, you are in the world of
eugenics.

The counter argument will be that this is not really human
experimentation. That embryo they are editing is not a person. It’s not
like they will be pulling kids out of school and zapping they with the
CRISPR gun to “fix” their defects. That sort of argument is a dodge and
a common one used by our betters. Left unmentioned is the reason to edit
the embryo, which is so that the resulting human comports with what the
editors set out to create as a finished product. It’s designer babies
and that’s eugenics.

There’s another aspect to it. Mistakes will be made. In fact, dig around
in the literature and that is the assumption. The process will involve
multiple embryos and the correct one will be used and the rest
discarded. This assumes human error. But then, maybe the human error is
not detected until six months into pregnancy or six years into life.
Like any other manufacturing process, recalling defects will have to be
a part of the discussion at some point. <a

get what you paid for, which means sending back the lemon, if it comes
to it.
