I am torn on whether this age should be called the Carny Age, the Crazy
Age, or the Age of Hysteria. I like all three and there are probably
others that work, but the last one really gets to the heart of the
matter. America is like an aging woman, suddenly realizing that her
biological clock is running out of ticks. All of that phony confidence
she learned from modern feminism is quickly turning into anger and
bitterness. Much of the lunacy is driven by early and middle middle-aged
women.

Here is a perfect example. [This
story](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2021/03/oral-roberts-ncaa-anti-lgbtq-code-of-conduct)
is written by a middle-aged Indian woman attacking one of the schools in
the big basketball tournament. The whole point of the story is so the
aging mediocrity can get some attention. Look at [her
resume](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hemal-jhaveri-87535466/) and you see
that her “I am woman here me roar” life choices did not work out as the
lesbians in the woman’s studies department promised. Mx. Jhaveri has
never reached higher than an entry level position at small media
outfits.

Time after time, what has been termed cancel culture, turns out to be
projectile hysteria by early middle aged women. The Huffington Post is
nothing but a coven of homely women in terror over hitting the wall. It
is why they foment so much of the doxing and cancel culture nonsense.
Popular culture is one long night of premium ice cream, Lifetime channel
marathons and late night texting. Our women have gone insane and taken
the rest of the country with them.

That is why Age of Hysteria seems to work the best. It also implies that
the solution is something like [this](https://youtu.be/fT4s5ZdmIY8). On
the other hand, the underlying cause of this is the carny morality that
has taken over the ruling classes. None of our betters has anything
resembling dignity now, not even the British royals. That current batch
looks like extras from one of those game shows where contestants agree
to do humiliating things in order to win some cash prizes. The prize
today is an Oprah interview.

Everywhere you look in the ruling classes, the people who should be
secure in their position are desperately shouting, “Look at me! look at
me!” Despite their wealth and power, they carry on like they need
affirmation. That is the carny culture. The engine that drives that sort
of society is the willingness to do anything for some applause, some
attention, or some laughs. Whatever it takes to get the crowd to perk up
and take notice of you is acceptable. There is no bad publicity.

As I said in the show, people living in a period rarely know how it will
be viewed from the distance of time. Given the current trajectory, the
Zoomers could look back on this time in a generation and call it the
Golden Age. How this time is viewed will depend a lot upon how the
current crisis concludes. People in the 1970’s thought they were doomed,
but then things turned around for a couple of decades. Maybe that is
what awaits us in the coming years. A period of relative calm and good
fortune.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

**Promotions:** The good folks at

readers of this site. You just click on the

target="_blank">this link</a> and they take care of the rest. About a
year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
