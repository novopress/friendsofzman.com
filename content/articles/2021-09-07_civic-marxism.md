Back in the heyday of conservatism, Bill Buckley would often say you can
know everything about a person’s politics from their options on abortion
and Israel. It was true to the extent that it put them one side or the
other of the consensus. By the late 20th century, the ruling consensus
in Washington was pro-abortion and pro-Israel, but not publicly
enthusiastic for either. These two issues were useful proxies for
foreign policy and social policy at the time.

Something similar can be said of race and culture. Those who deny the
reality of race are on one side of the great divide, while those who
accept biological reality are on the other side of the divide. There is
no middle ground. Those who think culture is a manufactured good are on
the side of biology deniers, while those who think culture is the
product of biology and time are on the side of the realists. Again,
these are mutually exclusive positions that cannot be reconciled.

That is what makes
<a href="https://americanmind.org/salvo/freedom-from-blackness/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">this post</a> over at the American Mind
interesting. According to their website, “The American Mind is an online
publication of the Claremont Institute dedicated to the ideas that drive
our political life.” Claremont was founded in 1979 by four students of
political theorist Harry V. Jaffa, the man responsible for the second
founding thesis. He is also why so-called conservatives preach the
glories of Lincoln to their mostly Southern supporters.

The title of the post is the first clue that the writer is not only on
the denialist side of the great divide, but in their left-wing camp. The
first sentence sounds like something from a grievance studies paper. It
is pure cultural Marxism. “The fabricated black race should never have
been born. It was confected out of false biological taxonomies by
Europeans to justify a system of human physical bondage that,
paradoxically, brought black people into the historical process.”

Whenever you see the phrase “historical process” you are almost always
dealing with a man of the Left. This is right out of the Young Hegelian
view of history that was allegedly rejected by Strauss. If there was any
doubt as to the views of the author, the next sentence clears it up. “It
was a cruel, artificial construct, and blacks have suffered enough under
it.” When someone speaks of race as a social construct, they do so not
to clarify, but to obscure the reality of biology in human affairs.

A further example of that desire to obscure reality in the fog of
rhetoric is this sentence further down in the post. “A taxonomy that
makes human distinctions based not on cultural differences—which can
objectively be defined as the set of dominant beliefs, customs, and
traditions of a homogenized or non-homogenized group—but based on race,
which none of the conceptual markers that allow us to predict or pick
out any moral characteristic of a human being, is valorized by most
blacks.”

This is another habit of the far-left. They conflate issues so that the
easy to defend can be blended with the impossible to defend. In this
case, he claims cultural differences can be quantified. This is true to
a point. Then says racial differences tell us nothing about moral
characteristics of people. This is also true, but it is incorrect to
compare culture with morality in this way. It is a false comparison.
Further, race helps us explain cultural differences and is quite useful
at predicting them.

Then we get this sentence. “Holding a racial identity turns one into a
practicing racist. White supremacists of all stripes, either of the
North American variety or the Nazi counterpart, have given us ample
evidence of the nefarious nature of strong racial identities, especially
when they are wedded to a political ideology that demonizes
racial/ethnic minorities such as blacks or Jews.” That is jargon right
out of the grievance studies department of a state university.

It is tempting to dismiss this as irrational ranting or maybe a display
item used by the Claremont people to show they are not racist. The
conventional Right has always loved putting the intellectual version of
a lawn jockey on the pages of their publications to own the Left by
being to the left of them on race. Donald Trump spent a good deal of his
presidency celebrating his gifts to people who hated him just to prove
that he was not the evil racist his enemies claimed.

Beyond that, it suggests that the path of civic nationalism, the sort
preached by people like Ben Shapiro, must end up in cultural Marxism.
Once you deny that biology is real and has a real impact on social
organization, you are left with a problem. How does culture come into
existence, if it is not a function of blood and soil? The answer they
are left with is that it is a product imposed on people by other people.
Culture is just ideas, and they can be anything you like.

There is nothing more Marxist than this interpretation of culture. The
cultural Marxist seek domination of the institutions for this reason.
They believe culture is the product of societal institutions. If you
control them, you can control the culture. The civic nationalist, like
Strauss, believe there is an ideal culture. If you get that right, then
the institutions fall into place. In both cases, the underlying
assumption is that the nature of man plays no role in the final outcome.

To deny that biology is the prime mover of both history and culture
inevitably leads to man declaring himself the prime mover. This is what
we see here. The writer assumes humans can be talked out of their racial
identity. There is a short hop from there to thinking that humans must
be compelled to abandon their natural identity. This is the same path
that all such thinking takes. If man is free of nature’s god, then he
can recreate himself and his fellow man by his own lights. He becomes
man’s god.

The end of most journeys is determined by the starting point. It is why
intellectuals of all types talk about first principles. It is that
starting framework that lays out the path forward and ultimately sets
the destination. When the first principle is a denial of observable and
measurable reality, the road suddenly opens up to wherever the
imagination can conjure. So far, all of those imaginary destinations
have not been the utopia, but rather a hellish bloodbath of murder and
mayhem.
