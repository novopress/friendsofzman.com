There are two strains of thought on this side of the great divide with
regards to the behavior of the people in charge. One camp, the dominant
camp, thinks there is an organized campaign run by a small group of
people. The so-called deep state pulls the levers resulting in the
things we see happening in the world. The other camp, the much smaller
camp, subscribes to the emergent behavior doctrine. What we see is the
result of the hive mind that dominates the managerial class.

By any reasonable standard, the deep state side has the easier claim.
Spend a week following the main regime media organs and a pattern
emerges. On a Monday, the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street
Journal and other legacy operations will be running with the same theme.
The next day, all of the next tier media operations are running with the
Monday theme. By the end of the week, the media narrative has become
conventional wisdom, maybe even holy writ.

For example, the midterms are coming up and the uniparty is a little
worried that the rubes may be catching on, so they have the media doing
their fear, uncertainty and doubt act to wrap up the summer. <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/24/new-york-special-election-midterms/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is the Post claiming the red
wave nonsense is fading fast. Totally by coincidence, the Times has a
similar <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/24/upshot/midterms-elections-republicans-analysis.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">story</a>. They say it is abortion that
is killing Republican chances.
<a href="https://www.joshbarro.com/p/republicans-other-dobbs-problem"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> and <a
href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/2022-primaries/red-wave-looks-more-ripple?redirect=630621a8409fa"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a> are supporting sources for the
same claims made by the big media sites.

The effect of what certainly looks like an orchestrated campaign is
supposed to be a collapse of opposition to the regime. Alongside these
posts about the dimming Republican hopes in the election are stories
about how Glorious Leader has magically made student debt go away. NBC
<a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/almost-half-latino-student-loan-debt-expected-forgiven-biden-rcna44652"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">claims</a> that almost half of Latino
debt will be wiped away by Glorious Leader. A debt jubilee that targets
an important uniparty demographic just when Republican hopes are fading.
What a coincidence!

Whether any of this is true is hard to know. It really does not matter
if it is true because by next week it will be gospel. Just look at the
Russian collusion hoax. Regime media still <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/08/24/barr-mueller-memo-trump/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">carries on</a> as if it is obvious that
Trump was in league with Putin, who used his super powers to rig the
election. He did not rig the 2020 election, which was the cleanest in
human history. Only election deniers think otherwise. He rigged the 2016
election, which only QAnon thinks is real.

The point is, spend any time consuming the main media organs of the
regime and it certainly looks like it is all coordinated. Add to it the
known fact that the activist we call journalist have been caught
coordinating their work. Ezra Klein operated a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JournoList" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">secret group</a> of four hundred far-left activists
working in the media. The point was to coordinate their activism across
many platforms. This is the sort of thing that supports the deep state
idea, but also the claims about its nature.

The thing is though, there is little evidence that spooks from the
wilderness of mirrors are behind these operations. When people hear the
phrase “deep state” they think of men in stuffed chairs discussing how
best to hide the alien space craft that just landed in the desert. The
deep state rigged the food pyramid so normal men are filled with soy and
therefore easy to manipulate. The deep state is not paranoid weirdos
working in the media, sharing the hive mind.

That is the argument against the deep state and for the hive mind. That
really is the nut of the emergent behavior argument. Fill a room with
people who line their clothes with aluminum foil and very weird things
will emerge. The people who work in the media believe completely in the
deep state argument. They just think it is run by guys name Prescott and
Pemberton. They are raising a secret invisible Hitler army to implement
the final final solution.

The further you go up the system, the cultural and ideological diversity
thins to the point where it becomes a hive mind. In the media, you
cannot survive unless you support the latest things. The selection
pressure is for compliance. A process operates across the high ground of
the empire. Walk into the C-suites of a large company and it is power
skirts, soy faces and a unified commitment to the latest thing. Woke
capital emerged from within capital. It was not imposed on it.

The appearance of coordination is the result of a shared set of beliefs
by the people who run the important bits of the empire. If tomorrow they
suddenly converted to Islam, their women would be wearing head coverings
and the men sporting beards. They would carry on as if they had been
Islamic since forever. Anyone asking about the sudden conversion to
Islam would be called a blasphemer. The New York Times style guide would
be relabeled the sharia style guide.

We got a real world test of this claim in February. Russian tanks
crossed into the Donbas and instantly every talk head on television was
sporting a Ukraine lapel pin and chanting “Keev” like they had a novel
form of Tourette’s. It was as if someone updated their firmware
overnight. In a way, this is what happened. Everyone was suddenly
imitating the others in the hive. It was not a conscious act. There was
no discussion or dissent from the program. It was the latest thing.

Just consider what is happening with the Covid vaccine. When Trump
announced the program, the hive condemned it as orange poison. Trump
exits and suddenly the hive claims the vaccine the universal elixir.
They literally spent two years forcing people to take the shot. Now that
it is clear it was a fraud from the start and is causing serious health
problems, they are pivoted back to <a
href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/24/trump-white-house-exerted-pressure-on-fda-for-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-house-report-finds-00053428"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">blaming Trump</a>. The hive now believes
the vaccine debacle was caused by the Trump conspiracy.

When you see these people swinging wildly from one invented reality to
the next, it is hard to see the hand of Pemberton and Prescott. Instead,
it looks like a murmuring of starlings, rushing in and out of the trees.
What controls them is the undefinable, but omnipresent hive mind. They
believe the same things, so they react the same way to events, even
events they create. The Covid mania makes much more sense when you think
of it as a manifestation of a shared reality.

Of course, both sides of this debate can be right. Our ruling class is
largely controlled by a shared reality, a new secular religion, but
elements inside the hive scheme to manipulate events to their advantage.
Here we have Google blithely <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/google-roll-out-anti-disinformation-campaign-some-eu-countries-2022-08-24/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">admitting</a> to running a psychological
warfare campaign on the people of Europe. Clearly, the people inside
Google excogitating this scheme know what they are doing. On the other
hand, they think this is perfectly normal. It is their nature.

This is why it is probably not good to go all in on the deep state or
the emergent behavior explanation for what we are seeing. Both are
correct to a point but fail to explain the whole. Instead, it is best to
think of the people in charge as members of a religious cult and part of
that cult is a hatred of normal people. The religion of the Cloud People
naturally leads to coordinated efforts to harm the Dirt People. They do
this because they have to. It is their nature.
