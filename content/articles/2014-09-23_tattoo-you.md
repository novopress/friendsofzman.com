rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Steve Sailer has a funny post
up about tattoos</a>. I’m old enough to remember when tattoos had
meaning. It used to be that a man got ink if he was a criminal, a
soldier, a sailor or a carny. Criminals used ink to signal their
membership in gangs and to advertise their violence capital. Even the
baddest of bad men prefer to avoid violent conflict if possible.
Displaying the fact you will kill if provoked lets other bad guys know
to avoid you. This is still true today.

Warriors have been inking up for as long as anyone knows. It used to be
that soldiers got their unit insignia and maybe some ink to remember
battles or places they experienced. Barbarians in antiquity used tattoos
as a form of ornamentation. Vikings died their teeth. Sailors have long
used ink to document their travels. A turtle standing on its back legs
(shellback) for crossing the equator and being initiated into King
Neptune’s Court. Again, this is a ritualized form of tattooing that has
nothing to do with self-expression. It’s about membership.

The modern tattoo fad comes down from carny-folk who used tattoos as
form of self-segregation. People who wished to live outside proper
society would get all sorts of weird ink. Modern people are unaware of
this connection. They have been told it is a form of self-expression,
when it is really self-abnegation. Piercings are another tradition
passed down from carny-folk to the modern hipster.

The modern tattoo trend is in reaction to the homogenizing effects of
globalization and mass media. Regional and local weirdness has been
thrown into the blender of mass global culture. The resulting gray
slurry leaves few ways for an individual to set himself or herself
apart. Young people, who are wired to “peacock” for mates use tattoos
and piercing to draw attention. In a world where everyone lives the
same, thinks the same and believes the same, superficial decoration is
all that’s left. Strangely, you never see people talking to one another
about their tattoos.

Another possibility is the modern tattoo is a form of self-mutilation.
Greeks and Romans associated tattoos with barbarians. Greeks would
tattoo their slaves, for example, as a way to distinguish them from
Greeks. The Latin word  for tattoos is “stigma” and had the same meaning
it does today. The Romans would tattoo criminals as a form of
punishment. Soldiers who failed in their duties, but not so much to
warrant death, would be tattooed and sent off to the frontier.
