Doug Ross is out with his annual awards for blogs and sites that cater
to the Right and guess who is in the top tier? That’s right, yours truly
is on the list of Most Influential sites this year. I’m right in there
with the heavy hitters of the New Right. I’m not sure I deserve it, but
I’ll take it.

The top spot goes to The Conservative Treehouse and that seems like a
good choice. I was never a reader until this year, but I check in
frequently these days. That’s mostly because I hear it mentioned on the
great Howie Carr show and John Derbyshire mentions it on occasion in his
podcast. That means it has reached a very wide audience in a short
period of time. It is a fine site that is worth checking out regularly

The section titled “The Biggest Losers” is spot on. I know more people
who quit reading these sites than people who continue to read them. It’s
not so much their hostility to Trump and Trump voters that got them in
trouble. No, it is their unwillingness to stray too far from the
Progressive porch. When BLM was running around killing cops, these sites
spent more time telling us how much they loved Lincoln than analyzing
what was happening. Kept men are interesting to no one.

Doug gives his own site an award and he should. You can do a lot worse
than
<a href="http://directorblue.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Bad Blue</a>
as a home page. He spends a lot of time each day linking to other blogs
and news sites that would interest the sort of monsters who notice
things and pay attention. Aggregation is one of those things that makes
the Internet much more usable, which is why Drudge remains a top-10 site
after all these years. When curious about what to think about I scan
through what Doug has linked.

Back to me for a second. The site is averaging about 75K readers now and
according to the traffic stats, link backs and so forth, the growth is
steady. Facebook and Twitter drive a lot of traffic, but I turn up on
google searches too so that means other sites are linking to the blog.
If you enter “opposite rule of liberalism” into your nearest google
machine, look at the results. I’ve tried this for other pithy phrases
I’m fond of using and the results are similar.

I am, of course, very thankful for the recognition. It is always nice to
have someone praise your labors. I’m also thankful for the readers and
commenters who make the site infinitely more interesting. I have no
plans to quit this year so my hope is the readership breaks the 100K
mark in 2017. More important, support the media that supports you. Guys
like Steve Sailer and John Derbyshire could use a few bucks so donate
during their beg-a-thons. The sites Doug highlights could always use
more readers so recommend them when warranted.

Thank You!
