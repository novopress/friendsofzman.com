**Note:** The audio quality is a little wonky this week. The opening is
a click faster than normal and some bits in the middle are a bit slower
than normal. I record these in pieces and when they were spliced
together something went wrong. I did not have time to di into it and it
is not that big of a deal, but it has been noted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The response to the show last week was not what I expected, as I did not
think the content of the show was all that good. I got a lot of feedback
from people who had been involved in organizing and activism. It looks
like this is a topic on the minds of people who have experience with
trying to organize at the grassroots level. A few people suggested
writing about the basics of organizing, which is a good idea. Our side
has nothing in that regard. The Left has tons of material.

The closest our side has to handbooks on organizing is stuff people
ripped off from the far-left that has been repackaged with a new title.
The Alinsky tract *Rules for Radicals* becomes *Rules for Conservative
Radicals*. Imitating winners is never a terrible idea, but the people in
charge organize under different rules than those seeking to oppose or
subvert those in charge. The goals are obviously different, but the
range of motion is different due to the imbalance of power and
resources.

That is why there is a limit as to how much can be borrowed from the
Left when it comes to organizing and activism. This starts with the
right-wing radical breaking free of the belief that he speaks for a
majority. There is no doubt that the majority would nod along to what he
says but they will not lift a finger until they get permission from the
people in charge, who are the Left. Throwing energy at trying to
mobilize those who quietly agree takes away from effective organizing.

This is something I did not include in the show, but it has been a bane
of right-wing causes since forever. The Left is always looking to
convert people to their cause, while the Right always seeks to mobilize
the converted to the moment. This is why the Left is implacable, never
taking no for an answer. It is also why the Right so readily accepts
defeat and then internalizes it. Left-wing politics is about overcoming
popular objections while right-wing politics is about counting noses.

It is a big subject and deserves a much longer treatment. The show this
week is mostly thinking out loud about some aspects of organizing. It
really would make for a good book, but I need to finish the book I have
three quarters finished. Maybe if I ever get that done, I will take a
stab at this topic in more detail. It would also make for a good video
series, since young people prefer pictures to words. Young people do
most of the activism, so they are the proper audience.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link

few bucks a month to keep the lights on and the people fed. It turns out
that you can’t live on clicks and compliments.

readers of this site. You just click on the

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
