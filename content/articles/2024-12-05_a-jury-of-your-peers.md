Most people assume that you have a constitutional right to a “jury of
your peers”, but no such right exists in the law or reality. The phrase
does not appear anywhere in the text of the Constitution or the Bill of
Rights. In the debates over the new Constitution, there was no use of
this phrase. Like the phrase, “separation of church and state”, it is
one of those ideas that snuck in long after the Constitution was adopted
and people have come to accept it is a real thing that exists in the
law,

The Constitution is rather vague on the matter of juries. Article II
states that “the trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment,
shall be by jury” but that is a far cry from requiring a “jury of your
peers.” The closest it gets is the 6th Amendment which begins with, “In
all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy
and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein
the crime shall have been committed.”

What the Constitution tells us about juries and jury trials is that they
need to be speedy, local and impartial. Otherwise, it is up to the
states and localities to sort out the mechanics of the trial and the
nature of juries. The Framers could have been more specific but they
either assumed it was not necessary, given the customs of the age, which
had been handed down over many generations, or they thought it best for
states and localities to work out the details.

In the 18th century, no one could have imagined a jury drawn from
vagrants, imbeciles and lunatics, so there would have been no need to
provide against it. Juries were composed of respectable people, almost
always men. Since crimes were all state crimes, it made sense to defer
to the states on the process. By the time the Constitution was adopted,
every state had a court system, and they were generally modeled on the
English system for obvious reasons.

This is one of the many flaws in the Constitution. It was created by men
who lacked the imagination to provide for the rise of a universal and
timeless moral code that included men pretending to be women and drug
addicts having an unquestioned right to roam the streets, harassing the
citizens. They failed to appreciate the need to have two-digit IQ
people, barely able to dress themselves, sit on juries in cases
involving complex technical issues in narrow technical fields.

Daniel Penny is on trial for his life in New York City and his fate will
be decided by people who may not be able to read at a high school level.
New York City is now famous for madhouse juries, lunatic judges and
ideological prosecutors who use the former two conditions to persecute
their ideological enemies. Everyone outside the ideological fever swamps
understands that Daniel Penny is on trial because he is a white and the
crackhead was black.

If Daniel Penny was getting a jury of his peers, the bare minimum
requirement would be that the jurors be American citizens. We know that
at least one juror is a recent migrant from South America. Of course,
his peers would include those who have jobs and can read and write at a
college level. Given the endless racial agitation, a jury of his peers
would have to white or at least majority white. The jury sitting in
judgement of Daniel Penny meets none of the qualifications.

This is not a New York City problem. Kyle Rittenhouse is celebrating the
three-year anniversary of his acquittal. Everyone assumed he would be
found guilty in a rigged trial by a crooked judge, because this has
become the norm. He got lucky and was charged in a jurisdiction
dominated by sensible white people, including the judge. He was also
blessed with unusually stupid prosecutors. As a result, he got a fair
trial, and the jury promptly acquitted him of the charges.

The Rittenhouse case is an exception to the general rule of the American
legal system which is that you will never get a fair trial or a jury of
your peers. Instead, you will face an ideologue for a judge and a jury
of randomly selected simpletons. This is true on civil cases as well as
criminal cases. Elon Musk is fighting the courts over his Tesla
compensation because the Delaware judges hate him. Even the richest man
is subjected to trial by ideological madmen.

This is not a new phenomenon. The corruption of the legal system that
gave us the civil right revolution has also eaten away at the judicial
system. The maxim that anything that hints of discrimination is immoral
has resulted in jury selection becoming little more than drawing names
from a hat. The names in the hat are composed of people too stupid or
lazy to avoid jury duty. The peremptory challenge of prospective jurors
has slowly disappeared from the system.

Like the phrase, “separation of church and state”, the right to a “jury
of your peers” has become a sad joke. The state has become a weird
secular theocracy rooted in the progressive lunacy that gave us the
civil right revolution. The state now makes war on actual churches in
the name of a religion it pretends is a set of timeless, universal moral
principles rooted in reason. As a result, a “jury of your peers” is a
threat issued by the clerisy running the system.

Destruction of the law is always the last phase of egalitarian
ideologies. Because men are not naturally equal, they must be made
unnaturally equal. For everyone to be a peer of everyone else, the tall
must be made short and the strong must be made week, because the
opposite is not possible. The law becomes a weapon in the war against
the people who make society possible. The civil rights revolution was an
act of revenge against the capable and it is reaching its logical end.
