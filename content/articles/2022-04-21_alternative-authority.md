Starting in the 1990’s the neocons started to talk about conservatism as
a process, a means justifies the ends approach to politics. This was not
a change in how conservatism defined itself but it was a change in how
it sold itself. You were supposed to support conservatives in order to
achieve certain ends, like rolling back abortion laws and curtailing the
welfare state. By the Bush years, this means justifies the end claim was
front and center in the pitch from neoconservatives.

The reason for this, of course, is millions of conservatives had voted
for Bush and the Republicans thinking they would do what they promised.
The GOP had both house of Congress and the White House. They expected
conservative governance. Instead, they got Lyndon Johnson. They had to
accept this result, you see, because conservatism is a process, not a
set of end results. As long as conservatives were defending the process,
people needed to shut up and be happy.

The main reason for this rhetorical sleight of hand was to trick rank
and file conservatives into supporting a president that was the opposite
of what conservatives expected from a conservative president. The
neocons wanted to continue their bloody war against Islam and they
needed a second term from Bush. In the 2000’s, they had started to
infest the other side of the political class but the take over of the
foreign policy establishment was not complete.

This was possible because of a flaw within conservatism. From the
beginning, the Buckley people focused on defending the constitutional
order. They were the guys talking about interpreting the Constitution as
written. They were defending the system against both distortions and
changes from the Left. They magnanimously accepted adverse results as
long as the constitutional order was followed. This fetish for defending
process is what the neocons exploited.

This points to a much larger problem with conservatism. They were never
willing to appeal to authority to justify their claims. The closest they
got was originalism in the law, which claimed the written constitution
as authority. This has two problems. One was that the Left rejected this
claim in favor of a living constitution. The other is the Left kept
tinkering with document through judicial rulings which became
precedents. The result of originalism was a defense of left-wing gains
in court.

This is why conservatism is in collapse. In fact, it is fair to say that
conservatism is dead as hardly anyone bothers with the term. The only
people using the term are those still working the hustle on their aging
donor class. Otherwise, the only people considered to be on the Right
use the term is when criticizing the old conservative movement for not
having conserved anything. It turns out that winning the process war
meant nothing to those conservative constituencies.

The elephant in the room is authority. Fundamental to any human
organization is a clear understanding as to who decides. Iran is an
Islamic state with laws based in the sect of the ruling class. It is the
religious elite that is the ultimate decider. The Russian people are the
leaders of the Russian Federation and Vladimir Putin is the leader of
the Russian people, so he is the final authority in the Russian
Federation. This is clear to everyone who lives within the Russian
Federation.

In the case of Iran, authority for this arrangement, the thing that
legitimizes it in the minds of the people, is the Koran and their
religious traditions. The text of their holy book, the traditions of
their people and the moral hierarchy is the authority for their
political arrangements. In the Russian Federation, it is the long
history of these people and their relationship to one another that forms
the basis of authority. Its perseverance through communism is proof of
this natural order.

This is where we see “common good conservatism” trying to fill the void
left by the collapse of Buckley conservatism and the departure of
neoconservatism. They want to move away from individual rights as the
center piece of conservatism toward a vague sense of collective
interests. Instead of focusing on what provides the individual with the
least amount of government coercion, they want to focus on what provides
the most amount of common good.

In simple terms, disputes over rights will be decided in favor of the
interests of society as a whole, rather than abstract principles about
individual liberty. If someone complains about prayer in school, the
courts should ignore their complaint because prayer in school provides
more social benefit than that one person’s desire to be free of the
religious sentiments of the community. Homosexual marriage would be
banned, because it harms marriage, which harms society.

This may sound good and feel like a step in the dissident direction, but
it suffers from the same defect as Buckley conservatism. That is, there
is little mention of who decides and upon what authority they make these
decisions. Some talk about the Church providing authority and others
mention the administrative state. Mostly this is just a way to avoid
speaking directly to the issue of authority. It is just assumed that
once people think in terms of the common good, everything falls into
place.

This is the same error conservatives have always made. Their chanting of
the phrase “ideas have consequences” was mostly about the belief that
all they had to do was win the argument and the rest would take care of
itself. History makes clear that force and determination can conquer the
soundest logic. The Bolshevik program was nonsensical and dangerous, but
they wanted it more so they carried the day and controlled Russia for
three quarters of a century.

Human society is based around a series of questions. Who we are? What
are the rules that define us? Who decides? What is the process for
enforcing the rules? It is only the last question that conservatives
bothered to answer, which left the other questions to whoever wanted to
answer them. This is why conservatism failed and any alternative will
fail if it refuses to address the questions that come before debating
the process by which rules are enforced.

The great trick of liberal democracy is in convincing people it exists.
The narrow elite that controls Western societies decides because they
control the managerial class, which in turn controls the administrative
state. Their authority rests on their will to power and the delusions of
the people, who steadfastly insist they decide public policy through the
ballot box. It is a devilish trick by a devilish people, but until an
alternative questions this arrangement directly, it will persist.
