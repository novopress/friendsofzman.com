This week I thought I would try something different and do an entire
podcast on just one issue, rather than pulling segments together from
stuff that caught my eye during the week. The reason is mostly variety,
but I have also been seeing the phrase “Dissident Right” turn up around
the internet. Before some millennial tries to define the term into some
bespoke sissy philosophy, I wanted to put some markers down about what
the term means.

I am not sure if this will be a regular thing. If I get a good response,
then maybe I will do other podcasts on single topics like this. If
people hate it, then I will forget the whole thing and pretend it never
happened. The goal here was to put together something that people could
think about, but also send to their confused normie friends and family
to help them make the journey to our side of the great divide. I will be
doing some posts on the topic as well.

I have one special announcement this week. Tomorrow I will be on the
[Happy Homelands podcast](http://www.jlokka.fi/) hosted by RamZPaul and
Tiina Wiik. It is a censor friendly live show about the news items of
the day. Someone named Junes Lokka will also be on the show. He is a
Finnish activist. You can post questions in the YouTube chat window and
maybe someone will answer them. This is my first live show, so we shall
see how it goes.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
