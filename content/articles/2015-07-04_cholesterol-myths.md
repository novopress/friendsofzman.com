*Fats were singled out as the major enemy.*

*Research results published in the mid-1900s indicated that fats in our
diets posed a health hazard.*

*Fats were not just full of calories that made us overweight. There were
indications that fats were the main reason why a wave of cardiovascular
diseases washed over the industrialised countries of the West starting
in the early 20th century.*

*Research efforts and nutritional advice focused on how dangerous fats
were and toward the end of the century a healthy diet consisted low-fat
foods – a message heard at the doctor’s office and hyped by all the
magazines.*

*Simultaneously, carbohydrates, including sugar, snuck below the radar,
according to Birger Svihus, a professor at the Norwegian University of
Life Sciences (NMBU).*

*Why were carbs viewed so long as positive for health?*

*Svihus thinks he has found the answer in research:*

*Scientists in the 1970s concluded that the human body could not convert
carbohydrates into fat.*

*That meant you couldn’t become overweight or clog your bloodstream with
fats by eating carbohydrates, whether they came from sweets or whole
grain bread.*

I’m often amazed by how much of the past has been forgotten. It is not
just the ancient times or even the medieval times. We cannot remember
what happened last week. There’s no great mystery as why the governments
got the diet recommendations all wrong and it was not an honest error.

The first thing to know is the
<a href="https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Framingham Study</a>. From Wikipedia:

*The **Framingham Heart Study** is a long-term, ongoing cardiovascular
study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The study
began in 1948 with 5,209 adult subjects from Framingham, and is now on
its third generation of participants.<sup>\[1\]</sup> Prior to it almost
nothing was known about the “epidemiology of hypertensive or
arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease”.<sup>\[2\]</sup> Much of the
now-common knowledge concerning heart disease, such as the effects of
diet, exercise, and common medications such as aspirin, is based on this
longitudinal study. It is a project of the National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute, in collaboration with (since 1971) Boston
University.<sup>\[1\]</sup> Various health professionals from the
hospitals and universities of Greater Boston staff the project.*

Initial finding from that study suggested a link between dietary
cholesterol and cardiovascular disease. Thus was born the low-fat craze
that has been with us for decades. Industry quickly figured out how to
capitalize on this and make enormous amounts of money.

The first way was to use a waste product from food production to make a
substitute for butter. That’s right. Margarine is made from waste. Food
companies quickly figured out that the stuff they were throwing away
could be re-purposed into “low-fat” foods. The stunning success of
margarine led to a flood of low-fat stuff that is still with us.

Of course you don’t sell product without advertising and advertising is
mostly about convincing people that your product is better than the
alternative. If you’re in the business of selling low-fat foods, what
better way than to point to government science as the reason your stuff
is better?

Of course, you need to make sure the science does not change so
lavishing the government and its scientists with money to keep proving
the same point is a good investment. It’s not an accident that Big Food
is an enthusiastic supporter of Big Government.

That may strike you as excessively cynical, but here is a long article
from <a
href="http://www.coconutresearchcenter.org/The%20Cholesterol%20Myth.PDF"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Atlantic Monthly</a> that is my
source. You’ll not the date is 1989. That’s right, I recalled from
memory an article from a quarter century ago and found it on-line.
