------------------------------------------------------------------------

In America, what is called the political Left operates within a few
modes of thought tied to seminal events on the Left. One if the civil
right era, another is the Watergate era and the other is interwar
Europe. All events are framed by this period. If they do not fit these
models then they are usually ignored. Of course, their framing of these
periods is cartoonish and absurd. It is all easy to understand heroes
and villains, who are stripped of moral ambiguity and nuance.

What passes for the Right has always been an echo of the Left, so they
have evolved similar framings. It took a while but the 1980’s is one of
their primary frameworks for talking about current events. They are
always looking for the next Reagan, Thatcher or Bill Buckley among the
current mediocrities. Their answer to almost every issue is a slogan
from the high water point of conservatism. Modern conservatism is a
cargo cult where current members ape the members of the past.

Like their friends on the Left, the Right also has an obsession for the
interwar period in Europe, but with a different emphasis. While the Left
checks under their bed every night to make sure Hitler is not waiting
for them, the Right is always sure Neville Chamberlain is lurking
somewhere, ready to give away the Sudetenland. Like the Left, their
understanding of that time is cartoonish and absurd. All the players are
exaggerated heroes or villains with crude moral choices.

This can be traced to the Reagan years. His innovation in the Cold War
was to call the Russians the “evil empire.” This may be the first
example of a politician convincing adults by using a reference to a
children’s show. Everyone dealing with an affluent white female liberal
(AWFL), who quotes Harry Potter all the time, can thank Ronald Reagan
for that bit of cultural innovation. Ever since, the right has sorted
the world into extreme villains and themselves as the heroes.

Of course, the most extreme villain is Hitler. Reagan stopped short of
calling Gorbachev the new Hitler, but that generation knew their
history. Those that followed have thrown around the Hitler language as
recklessly as the Left. Saddam Hussein was Hitler and his party was
“islamo-fascist.” In fact, every Muslim with a complaint about bombs
dropping on his head was called an “islamo-fascist” by conservatives.
Even the Taliban got this label from conservatives.

In this framing, every Hitler needs a Chamberlain and Churchill. In
conservative framing, Chamberlain is not a man who wished to avoid
another horrible European war, but a foolish sissy unwilling to face
reality. Churchill is not a reckless warmonger known for his alcoholism
and lack of judgment, but a heroic visionary who could spot Old Scratch
coming before anyone. Of course, every conservative sees a bit of
Churchill in himself, so he is always ready for another war.

We see this with the undeclared war on Russia. Putin is Hitler, despite
the Russian role in defeating the real Hitler. The Russians are the
Nazis invading Poland, even though the guys on the other side are
extreme Hitler enthusiasts. Biden has to be Chamberlain, even though he
barely knows where he is most of the time and it is his administration
that launched the war against Russia. His failure to take it to the
nuclear level is proof that he is too soft on the new Hitler.

You see this deranged mental state in this American Conservative <a
href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/nationally-reviewing-realism/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> about a warmonger convention
held in DC. Those who point out the massive failure of thirty years of
pointless wars of choice is now called a neo-isolationist. Note how not
supporting aggressive imperial wars of domination is isolationism. Note
also that the people who say this love quoting the Founders, except the
part where Washington warned about entangling alliances.

Part of this framing is the lack of scruples by modern conservatives.
The warmonger events are sponsored by the war machine and they pay well.
Sites like National Review are now wholly dependent on money from Big
Tech and the Military Industrial Complex, so they are happy to sell
endless war, foreign and domestic. Conservatism is now just the public
relations arm of the security state. It is why they never expose
themselves to pushback on these issues.

That aside, it still leaves the obsession with Hitler. In the middle of
the last century, the men who actually fought real Nazis rarely
mentioned Hitler. The occasional joke about the old enemies was as much
as they did. Their children and now their grandchildren, who grew up
insulated from all of life’s troubles, are obsessed with events that
happened almost a century ago in another country. The war on Russia
reveals that this derangement is getting worse.

The answer may simply be that the so-called conservatives are just boys
and girls playing a role, wearing costumes too large for them. Like
children in their parent’s clothes, modern political actors are midgets
compared to the men who created the roles they are now asked to play. To
make up for the fact that they are fleas on the society they inherited,
they exaggerate their role in it. A similar phenomenon drives the Left,
which also operates like a cargo cult.

Another factor is cultural inertia. The Global American Empire was born
in the Second World War and its evolution was in the context of its
shadow. The Cold War was driven by the energy of the war against
fascism. The energy from the initial creation of the empire was
channeled into the Cold War. The residual energy that now gets channeled
into endless wars of choice is just cultural inertia. It is the old
rationale for existence looking for a place to go in post-Cold War age.

Regardless, the only way forward for America and the West is to finally
close the books on the 20th century. That will require a lot of funerals
and retirement parties, but Father Time is undefeated in this regard.
Once the people defined by the endless fights over old ideas like
nationalism, fascism and communism are gone, then the new fights over
civilizationalism can begin. The question is whether the actuarial
tables can do their magic before it is too late.
