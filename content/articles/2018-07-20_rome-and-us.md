I decided to try something a bit different this week. I like the single
topic format, because it appeals to my natural sense of form and it
makes organizing the material a little easier. On the blog, I like using
history as a jumping off point for commentary about the current age, so
I though it could work for the podcast. This is the first effort and I’m
not entirely pleased with the result, but I figured it might be a
struggle initially. I probably should have narrowed the focus and used
just one period of Roman history, but you learn through struggle.

That’s the challenge with this idea. Even small events have lots of
angles to them and lots of interesting people. The time constraints of a
podcast mean skipping stuff in order to make a point. That’s what I
don’t like about this week’s episode. I found I had to be way to breezy
with the material. That’s a warning to the Roman scholars. Don’t bust my
balls on my very superficial use of Roman history. While I’m at it, the
Latin scholars should know my Latin was never good, despite the best
efforts of my Jesuit teachers.

Part of the inspiration for this week is the old BBC series
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connections_(TV_series)"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Connections</a> presented by James Burke.
Instead of a multidimensional analysis of history, I’m thinking
something similar for an analysis of the present. Historical analogies
are never perfect or even very precise, but they can be fun and useful.
It is one of those idea that sounds good in your head, but it may be
much harder to make work than I realize, so I started with something
easy like Rome. The history of Rome covers just about every possible
human condition.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I’m now on
Spotify, so the millennials can tune in when not sobbing over white
privilege and toxic masculinity.
