Today at 3:00 PM I will be debating cryptocurrencies with Kart Thorburn.
He is the house cryptocurrency enthusiast for Counter Currents. The
topic is whether crypto can threaten the hegemony of the dollar and fiat
currency in general. My position is that cryptocurrency can be useful to
dissidents on the margins, but it will never be a threat to legal
tender, regardless of who holds power
