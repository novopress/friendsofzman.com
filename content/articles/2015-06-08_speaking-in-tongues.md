You can’t help but notice that the New Religion is developing its own
language. It sounds like English and much of it is understandable to
English speakers. Much of it is a weird jumble of sounds that have
magical properties for the faithful, but sound like nonsense to normal
people. <a

the NYTimes</a>.

*To the Editor:*

*We are militant about justice, but the justice we seek and enact looks
like healing, reparation and care. We do have demands, but not that you
submit to our “etiquette,” rather that you join a culture of compassion
and acknowledge vulnerability.*

*College students are volatile, and if our “safe spaces” seem more for
hiding from ideas than for shelter from oppression, it is because we
occasionally confound structural injustice (which hurts, badly) with
being-in-the-world (also hurts). We are obliged as social individuals to
fight the first and weather the second, and also to help others do the
same.*

*We do have a settled philosophy. It combines an understanding of power
structures with the golden rule. Do unto others as you would if you
wanted to heal the pain of injustice. We ask no more than David Brooks
does: to defer to the complexity of reality, and to find in our
deference the kindness to care for one another’s vulnerabilities and to
be honest about our own. HANNAH McSHEA*

*Durham, N.C.*

*The writer is a student at Harvard.*

I understand that I’m just an unfrozen caveman lawyer, but this confuses
and frightens me. I do like the implied threat in this bit:

*“We do have demands, but not that you submit to our “etiquette,” rather
that you join a culture of compassion and acknowledge vulnerability.”*

How can that be read as anything but “join us or die”??

That’s the thing with new religions. When they can’t convert the
heathens, they settle for killing them. Fortunately the little princess
who wrote that letter and her coevals lack the stones to do it, but that
will not always be so.
