When I was in Dublin, I had a lot of fun watching the BBC and SkyNews,
mostly because they were still in shock over Brexit. It was as if they
learned that the Loch Ness Monster was real. They just could not come to
terms with the new reality. Every segment circled back to the vote and
how it was the worst thing to happen since Dunkirk. They talked about
Brexit in the same way people talk about life altering tragedies. At one
point, someone even said, “I’ll never forget where I was the day I heard
the news of Brexit.”

The interesting thing was that they were so sure that Brexit would be a
disaster that they were starting to pretend that the disaster was
happening, even though nothing had changed since the vote. At the time,
the markets were up and the economic indicators were all pointing in the
right direction. There was also the fact that the vote changed nothing.
It will take years to implement Brexit, assuming it ever happens, which
is unlikely. Still, the people on the Beeb were sure doom was at hand.

That’s the power of belief and a reminder that all the flapdoodole we
associate with the Left is not based in facts and reason. It is
something closer to a UFO cult, where the members, from time to time,
become convinced of some great event that is about to occur. When that
event does not happen, they go through a period of confusion and
sadness, like how normal people mourn an untimely death. The difference
is the Progs rally together to recast the event into a new great cause
with its own doomsday cult attributes.

You can see that in <a

target="_blank">this hysterical tirade by Mathew Julio Yglesias</a>. He
both Voxsplains the current crisis and provides a standard around which
his fellow moonbats can rally.

You could be forgiven for thinking he was writing about Barak Obama, but
that would require a level of self-awareness unacceptable in a religious
cult.

This is from a guy who supported Hillary Clinton. It once again points
out a feature of the Left and something you always see with the hive
minded. They cast onto their enemies all of the things they fear about
themselves. Membership in a mass movement is about self-abnegation. The
adherent wants to obliterate his sense of self and replace it with the
identity of the cause. The result is all the things they despise about
themselves become the first things they assume about their enemies.
Their bogeyman is always a reflection of themselves.

What we are seeing with the Trumpening is the same thing the Brits saw
with Brexit. These people were absolutely convinced that they were
riding the warm thermals of history, like gentle little butterflies
drifting from one flower to the next, until they reached the valley of
the chosen. It’s not that they cannot accept losing. They did not think
losing was a possibility. These events are dis-confirmation of their
most important beliefs. It turns out that history has no right side,
after all, and that’s the cornerstone of the Progressive faith.

The tantrums and warnings of doom are just a way for the faithful to
rally together to support one another as they figure out how to
reconfigure the prophesies to fit the new reality. It is no different
from what has been observed with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Prophecy_Fails"
target="_blank">UFO and doomsday cults</a>. The believers become
convinced X is about to happen and X will confirm all of their beliefs.
When X does not happen, they are faced with the prospect of their
beliefs being proved false. That was election night for the American
Left.

What we are seeing now is the leaders of the cult trying to rally their
members to provide mutual support. Focusing their attention on the
alleged evils of the other side takes the focus away from the
dis-confirmation. If they can muster their numbers, they can will their
way through the crisis and reorganize their beliefs to incorporate the
dis-confirmation into the narrative. In time Brexit and Trump will
become part of the struggle myth that motivates the faithful to keep
fighting. After all, they are on the right side of history.
