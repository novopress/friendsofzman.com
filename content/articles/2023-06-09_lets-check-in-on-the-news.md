The world can go a long time without anything important happening, but
then all of a sudden, we get a lot of history in a short period of time.
Of course, it just feels this way to us humans with our short lifespans.
In those slow periods, lots of things are happening, but they go
unnoticed. They build up over time and then all of a sudden, everyone
notices them all at once, along with other things.

We may be in one of those processes. The regime is about to arrest
another political opponent for the crime of being a political opponent.
Trump is not the first to be jailed by the current regime. Dungeons
around Washington continue to hold political prisoners waiting for their
rigged trial for January 6. Jailing Trump is merely another red line
that this regime has been willing to cross.

Most everyone reading this remembers when Americans mocked countries
that engaged in these sorts of shenanigans. America was not perfect and
there were many cases of people getting abused for their politics, but
nothing like this. Victims of the system could expect the public to be
outraged. They could also expect people in the system to give them a
fair hearing and maybe redress their grievances.

All of a sudden none of that is true. America is one of those countries
we used to mock for their lawless disregard for orderly governance. This
is just one of the “all of a sudden” events we are about to experience.
The war in Ukraine is about to pack a whole lot of history into a short
period of time. Months of official lies are about to bob to the surface
in all sorts of unpleasant ways.

Of course, our world has been changing in other ways that have largely
gone unnoticed but will be noticed all of a sudden. Pat Robertson going
to the great fundraiser in the sky is a reminder that we are on the cusp
of a great demographic turnover. All those old guys who made their bones
in the great interregnum, maybe made it possible, are about to exit the
stage. The past is receding quickly.

Years ago, I wrote something about this age being like a point where
multiple rivers meet in a great confluence. Instead of rivers, it is
long and short social cycles that are ending at the same time. The long
cycle is Western liberalism. Another longish cycle is the American
empire. A short cycle is the baby boom generation. There are others, all
reaching their denouement in this age. It will be a wild ride.
