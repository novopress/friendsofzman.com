**Note:** I will be on the RamZPaul election roundtable tonight. This is
for his <a href="https://ramzpaul.gumroad.com/l/wfezh" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">subscribers</a>, so if you want to be a part of it, pay
the man five bucks. If you do not like it you can cancel and you spent
less than a Starbucks coffee. It is interactive, so you are not on
listen-only mode. You can have a speaking role.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The great day is upon us. It used to be that the media would roll out
some long serving geezers to give a lecture about the beauty of
democracy. They would wax poetic about the wonderfulness of ordinary
citizens doing their civic duty. Even though we may not like the
results, we had to respect the process. That was when the results never
questioned the elite consensus. These days the media rolls out
conspiracy theorists telling us half the voters are actually Russian
bots.

That will be the story tonight. The bad guys are expected to take it on
the chin as normal people manage to outnumber the dead at the ballot
box. The official line now is that the only way to preserve democracy is
to have a one-party state. The Los Angeles Times makes this point in
their
[fatwah](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/journalists-are-failing-americans-by-insisting-on-nonpartisanship-los-angeles-times-op-ed-writes/ar-AA13IuPi?ocid=msedgntp&cvid=be49e515faaf4f1bb00eab34004c2539)
against the Republicans. The Atlantic [tells
us](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/11/gop-congress-2022-midterm-elections-rights/671996/)
that the Republicans will immediately implement a police state after the
election, followed by the return of everyone’s favorite uncle.

From a dissident perspective, this is all encouraging. The more that the
people who exclusively benefit from the system disparage the system, the
sooner everyone will believe them and the whole things becomes unstable.
We may be at that point already, depending upon the degree of
shenanigans tonight. If we see a repeat of 2020, even the civic
nationalists will have to notice. As Tucker pointed out, you will know
the election is rigged if brain damaged hobo wins tonight.

Rigging a midterm is much more difficult than rigging a presidential
election, so the odds of mass shenanigans tonight are low. In a
presidential election, you just have to stuff one ballot box per state.
In the midterms, where there are 435 congressional races and up to
thirty Senate races, it is a mammoth task. It is why the Republicans
gained seats in the 2020 election, despite the claim that Joe Biden was
the most popular man since the dawn of time.

Given the mood of the country and the staggering incompetence of the
regime the last few years, it is going to be a tough night for the
regime. The benchmark for bad nights is 2010 when the regime lost 63
House seats. That is probably not what we can expect tonight, as the GOP
gained seats in 2020. In other words, many of the seats the regime would
have lost were lost in the prior election. On the other hand, people are
unusually angry this time so it could be a wild night.

Of course, from the dissident perspective this is just theater to
provide some much needed amusement in these dark times. The Republicans
will do nothing useful with their victory once they take control of
Congress. They will have some hearings that will produce nothing but
more fog to cover up the crimes of the regime. They will sign off on
more money for the war machine. There will be ceremonial votes on stupid
things that have no chance of success.

The way to think of the Republican party is as punishment. When normal
white people get fed up with the regime, they vote against the regime.
By default, this puts the Republicans in the majority, which they hate.
They return the favor by finding ways to punish the people who voted for
them. It is as if the regime says, “You do not like what we are doing?
Well then, let the punishment begin. The beatings will stop when you
people start voting the right way.”

The fact is, the worst thing to happen to white people in America has
been the Republican party, with the conservative movement a close
second. It was the GOP that flung open the borders in the 1980’s. It was
the conservatives who convinced white people to worship corporates
America. It was the Republicans who gave us the police state in the Bush
years and a maniacal war machine. Of course, it is the GOP that
unleashed the virus known as neoconservatism.

Keep that in mind as you enjoy the salty tears from the maladapted
mutants rending their garments and gnashing their teeth tonight. It will
be a fun time watching them carry on like idiots, but their sorrow will
quickly turn to a venomous rage. By the time the cock crows they will be
telling the Republican leadership to have their plans for retribution
ready for inspection. Even so, you have to take pleasure where you can
in the world, so enjoy the sight of the wicked writhing in agony
tonight.

All that said, the voting process is not entirely worthless. The game
may be rigged in Washington, but it is still fairly useful locally. The
lesson of Covid is that local government matters more than national
government. States run by civic minded white people had a much easier
time of it than the states run by crazies. Ron DeSantis won his election
by a handful of votes over Andrew Gillum, who was later found using meth
with a group of gay men in Miami.

The thing with the local races is the margin of error is higher. You can
live with a governor who is a good government civic nationalist. In
Washington, these guys are turned into weapons against common decency.
Locally these guys get the potholes fixed and make sure the schools are
free of perverts. They may not get the tragedy that is unfolding in
America, but they take care of the small quality of life things that
make the road to perdition much smoother.

The other benefit of participating in local elections is it allows our
people to exercise the long atrophied muscles of self-determination. The
nationalization of politics, along with the financialization of the
economy and the homogenization of the culture, have turned most white
people into passive actors. Choices are presented on the screen. The
user selects one option and hopes what pops out is what they like. The
system rewards normie, so normie proliferates.

When you get involved locally, you actually have to get involved in
organizing and socializing with other humans. Those old muscles used for
organizing in self-defense get some use, as well as the ability to
express genuine concerns to your neighbors about the issues that matter
to them. For dissidents, involvement in local elections is good practice
for learning how to organize. It is those who are best organized who
will prosper when the system becomes unstable.
