I’m back from over the horizon and I’m just starting to get back to my
normal schedule and feel myself. Any time I go away, even for a few
days, I need a week to get back into my normal routine. I don’t know why
this is exactly. I think one reason may be that I always maintain a full
dance card, so when I break my routine, I fall behind on things. When I
return, I then have to spend a week playing catch-up. On the other hand,
it could simply be that I am now a creature of habit and any break in
the routine throws off my game.

Regardless, this week’s show was thrown together in about two hours.
Normally, I start making notes the weekend prior and then collect up the
material I want to use during the week, so I can have time to record and
edit. I’ll go through it a couple of times to clean up the “um’s and
ah’s” that seem to be a feature of my spoken word. This week I did not
have the time for any of that, so you’ll have to forgive the quality.
Not only do I suffer for my art, but I make you suffer along with me.
Just hope I never decide to cut off an ear.

This week I spend some time on the new mystery cult we see forming. That
is the initiates into the secret ways of the sexually assaulted. Once
you declare yourself in this club, you not only get magical powers,
mortals are no longer allowed to question anything you say, not matter
how insane. In fact, you’re not even allowed to ask for a definition of
sexual assault, a term that appears to mean everything and nothing.
Another perk of being in this club is you and the rest of the hens get
to pick the Supreme Court judges.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I’m now on
Spotify, so the millennials can tune in when not sobbing over white
privilege and toxic masculinity.
