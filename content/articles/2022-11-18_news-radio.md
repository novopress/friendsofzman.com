Been pressed for time this week so I took the easy way out and cranked
out a show about the news. Thankfully, Trump made his big announcement
so the news was full of loony stories about Trump. I have never been a
big Trump fan, but I have appreciated the knock on effect of his career.
He has flushed out many people who had previously been thought of as
stable minded.

I recorded the show before I knew Nancy Pelosi fell off her broom. She
has called it a career as leader of the Democrats. The race to succeed
her will be interesting, as the bench is not very good. The scuttlebutt
is that Hakeem Jeffries from New York is lined up to be the next
Democrat leader. He could very well be more ridiculous than Pelosi,
which is something few thoughts was possible.

This will be the first test of the transition from the geezers running
the parties to the feckless airheads vying to succeed them. There will
be other tests as Schumer and McConnell have one foot in the grave.
Biden, of course, may already be dead but animated by secret forces.
Washington is about to enter the clown shoe phase as they move from the
dinosaurs to the circus freaks.
