Last week, the current president of Ukraine thanked Facebook’s Mark
Zuckerberg for his role in helping him win the propaganda war. Facebook
lifted its ban on praising the various neo-Nazi militias in Ukraine.
Then it announced it would allow calls for violence against individual
Russians. In the world of infinitely malleable ethics, this is what
Silicon Valley now calls a principled stand. Ukraine supporters are
proud of their work on social media wining the meme war with Russia.

In the real world, the Russian army is slowly turning Ukraine into the
world’s largest mound of rubble. In the Donbass, they have the Ukrainian
army and the tens of thousands of militia members surrounded. It is not
easy to get reliable information about what is happening on the ground,
but reliable estimates say fifty thousand pro-Ukrainian fighters are now
trapped in the Donbass “cauldron.” Barring a peace deal, they will be
vaporized over the next couple of weeks.

In the south, the Russian army has created a corridor to the Crimea.
This was a primary objective of the invasion. Mariupol, a city in
southeastern Ukraine, lies along the estuary of the Kalmius and Kalchik
rivers near the Sea of Azov. This city has been surrounded and cutoff by
the Russian army. The Ukrainian army based there has been given the
chance to surrender, but the irregulars will be given no quarter. It is
a preview of what will happen in the Donbass over the next month.

The point here is that despite losing the social media war, the Russians
are winning the actual war in Ukraine. It has been slow going as the
Russians do not wage television friendly wars, so no cool video. Ukraine
was slowly being turned into a fortified outpost by Washington, so the
Ukrainian army is well trained and supplied. Digging them out of those
fortification will not be easy, but it is inevitable. The Russians will
turn Ukraine into rubble if that is what it takes to achieve their
objective.

What this war has revealed is a clash of realties. On the Washington
side, reality is played out on TV chat shows, office politics and the
internet. They really think winning the public relations campaign
matters. In the reality in which Western leaders live, words count for
everything. Facts are just tools to be used to decorate a clever
argument or a novel public relations campaign. From the perspective of
the West, the war has been a disaster for Russia.

On the other side, the Russians operate in a different reality. They are
focused on securing their border, which means neutralizing Ukraine. They
have prepared for the economic consequences. They have prepared their
people, who seem to be overwhelming supportive of the effort. Westerners
have described Putin as having a medieval mindset, which may be true,
but he is dealing with a people and a reality that still thinks the old
way about the world.

Ukraine is now caught between two realities. The one reality is what
Samuel Huntington labeled the Orthodox civilization. This is Eurasia. On
the other side is what he called the Western civilization. According to
Huntington, the future will be shaped by the clash of the civilizations
he outlined in his book, *The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of
World Order*. What we are seeing in Ukraine is a collision between these
great tectonic plates that define conflicting realities.

Of course, the quarter century crusade against Islam by the Global
American Empire was a similar clash of civilizations. Huntington called
that area the Islamic civilization for obvious reasons. It is what is
commonly referred to as MENA, which stands for Middle East and North
Africa. America tried to impose its reality on the Islamic world and the
result was chaos. Every country in the region, except Israel and Iran,
is in worse shape now than when the crusade was launched.

In many respects, what we are witnessing is the test of two competing
post-Cold War theories of the future. One is the Huntington theory and
the other is the Francis Fukuyama theory, laid out in his book *The End
of History and the Last Man*. In it he argued that mankind had reached
the end-point of mankind’s ideological evolution and the triumph of
Western liberal democracy. There was nothing left to discuss, as liberal
democracy was the winner of the ideological contest.

By any measure, Fukuyama’s theory is proving to be all wrong, while
Huntington’s theory is looking prophetic. We are now in the midst of a
second great civilizational conflict where the reality of the West is
crashing onto the reality of another civilization, in this case Eurasia.
The reality of the West, social media campaigns and glib responses at
press conferences, is proving no match for artillery and armor, at least
not in the part of the world controlled by the Orthodox civilization.

On the horizon is the certain collision between what Huntington called
the Sinic civilization (China) and the West. East Asia is a bit more
complicated as there are a many old rivalries in that region. Huntington
diced the region into various subgroups like Buddhists, Hindus and the
Japanese. Even so, China will make a play to recover what she considers
to be her lost province, Taiwan. As we see in Ukraine, this will be a
clash between the reality of the West and the reality of China.

Lost in all of this is whether the reality of the Global American Empire
can survive these clashes with alternative realities. Prudence said that
the empire should respect the perspective of Russian with regards to
these areas along her border. Prudence said that the Muslim world should
be left to sort itself. Western liberal democracy was incompatible with
Islamic culture. Despite all of this, Washington continues to operate in
its own reality where words can conquer culture.

What we may be seeing is not only the clash of civilizations, but the
great test of the underlying sense of reality that animates Western
elites. Can they survive in a world in which they need to impose their
reality on the rest of the world, but the rest of the world will not
accept it? Either the West comes to terms with the fact that the rest of
the world will continue to operate by its own logic or it will destroy
itself in civilizational wars to impose its reality on the reality of
alien civilizations.
