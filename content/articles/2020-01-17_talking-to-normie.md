Continuing my experimental phase, the show this week is about ways to
talk to our normie friends and family, in a way that leads them our way.
I’ve been around civic nationalists recently and I was reminded of
conversations I’ve had with others about how tough it is sometimes for
dissidents to address the civic nationalist arguments in a way that
brings them our way. This week I thought a show on how to talk to normie
in a positive way would be interesting.

I was not sure how I wanted to structure it, so I took some of the
things that have come up recently in my normie interactions and made
those segment topics. Then I just turned the mic on and started talking
about each one, as if I was giving a short lecture to a classroom full
of civic nationalist. I was thinking of it like a class on dissident
politics for freshmen level students. I wanted it to be accessible to
the sorts of people who don’t spend any time on this side of the great
divide.

The key thing with talking to our normie friends, family and
acquaintances is to not become adversarial. The huge blunder our side
makes on social media is to mock these people as if they are enemies. A
little bit of that is fine, but fifty people blasting a civic
nationalist on Twitter is not winning him over. It’s only hardening his
position and making it easier for the gatekeepers to keep him inside.
These people are future allies and compatriots, not forever enemies of
the cause.

Effective organizing is building lots of on-ramps to this side of the
great divide, to make it easier for all sorts of people to come this
way. Language that will work on the 2A civic nationalist will not
necessarily work on the spergy libertarian. The Sean Hannity watching
patriot is going to respond to different rhetoric than the Tucker
watching Donald Trump supporter. Dissident politics needs to be like a
department store, with something for all the types of white people out
there.

This inability to build on ramps is why prior race realists have always
failed to gain any traction. They struck people as lunatics. They had
one on ramp. You had to pay the lunatic a toll in order to cross over.
The now defunct alt-right suffered from the same defect, as it became
loaded down with insider jargon and factionalism. All the ways into it
were narrow and went passed people that most people would find odd. It’s
why they could never break out of their subculture.

It is the heart of the optics debate. If dissident ideas are to gain
traction with typical white people, it has to creep up on them like the
fog. One day, they just find themselves on this side of the divide,
without realizing they made the journey. That happens by having lots of
ways here and lots of pleasant sounding people they can trust, subtly
pointing them in this direction. That can only work if there are lots of
doors through which they can pass into this type of politics.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
