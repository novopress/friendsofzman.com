------------------------------------------------------------------------

A year ago, when the Russians began to assemble forces along the Russia
– Ukraine border, Western planners were sure that whatever the Russians
were planning could only last a few months. They simply lacked the
resources to put an army in the field, especially against a heavily
defended opponent, for a long time. The Western response to the Russian
advance into Ukraine was predicated on this. By now, the war should have
been over due to a Russian withdrawal.

This short time frame thinking is clear in the economic sanctions that
were levied against Russia when the war started. It did not require an
advanced degree in economics to see that these sanctions would hurt the
West. Cutting off a critical vendor has to have a negative impact.
Western countries basically went to war with their most important
supplier of energy. They were willing to do this because the war would
be short and Russia would surrender to the West.

On its face this always looked like a crazy decision, but it was based
on two assumptions that have turned out to be even nuttier. The first
assumption was that Russia was nothing but a giant gas station run by
drunken peasants. Western economic sanctions would send the country into
economic turmoil and those drunken peasants would quickly revolt against
their stupid rulers. Back in the spring, predictions like
[this](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3483799-prepare-for-the-disappearance-of-russia/)
were placed all over Western media.

The second assumption was that China and India would eagerly jump aboard
the sanctions train. This has turned out to be the biggest error. China
and India have not only refused to join the sanctions regime, but they
have also moved closer to Russia and are now integral partners in the
anti-Western bloc. More critically, OPEC+ has also moved closer to both
Russia and China. Saudi Arabia recently
[signed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2022-12-09/china-saudi-arabia-sign-partnership-deal-video)
critical deals with China, despite Western pressure to the contrary.

These horrible blunders by Western planners have resulted in a long
brutal war on the doorstep of Europe. The Russians have slowly
reconfigured their systems for a long war, both economic and military.
On the battlefield, they are relentlessly pounding Ukrainian positions
while minimizing their casualties. The battle for Bakhmut, for example,
is being called a meat grinder. The Ukrainians are losing a thousand men
a day defending this one place in the Donbas.

No one in the West cares at all about the lives of Ukrainians, but they
have to care about the growing economic cost to the West. In parts of
Europe, energy costs are five times higher now than before the war. An
economic system based on cheap energy is not going to hold for long when
the energy costs start to rise. Europe is just at the beginning of this
energy crisis, with 2023
[promising](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/11/24/the-costs-and-consequences-of-europes-energy-crisis-are-growing)
even bigger price hikes. How much longer before this spills into the
political arena?

People who have seen the battle space in this war have described it as
something like the trench warfare of the Great War. The Ukrainian army
is dug into massive fortifications, surrounded by trench systems. In
places like Bakhmut, two thousand artillery shells a day will fall on
the defenders. The defenders fire back, but their artillery lacks the
range of Russian systems. Even so, much of the fighting is the sort of
artillery duels that were common in the Great War.

There is another parallel between the two wars. There is no path forward
for a negotiated end to the fighting. In the Great War, both sides were
locked into a mode of thought that prevented the necessary compromises.
For both sides, the war became an end in itself. Something similar seems
to have gripped the West, which has categorically ruled out a negotiated
settlement. Repeatedly, Western leaders have declared there can only be
one result – total victory.

As if to make sure the Russians also forgo all hope of a negotiated
settlement, the West sent former German chancellor Angela Merkel out to
tell the world that her prior dealings with Russia were a
[trick](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-russia-may-have-make-ukraine-deal-one-day-partners-cheated-past-2022-12-09/)
to buy the Ukrainians time. Until that interview, Merkel was one of a
few Western leaders Russia thought she could trust. Now they must assume
that they can trust nothing from the West. Therefore, Russia can never
expect to get a deal from the West at the bargaining table.

All of this leads to another important comparison between this global
conflict and the Great War a century ago. A century ago, the British
Empire was effectively destroyed by the totally unnecessary war in
Europe. Something similar may be waiting for the Global American Empire
in this war. Instead of surrounding Russia with enemies, the war will
end with the West being surrounded by a league of regional powers
committed to defending themselves from color revolutions.

The question that must follow is can the economic and political model of
the Global American Empire survive when it is confined to a minority of
the world? The West is a little more than a tenth of the global
population. How will the GAE function if the EU is in economic ruins?
Can the petrodollar survive if the largest energy producers are
comfortable dealing in alternative currencies? These are questions that
get to the core logic of the American empire.

Perhaps what we are seeing is the same thing that happened to the
British Empire at the start of the last century. The Global American
Empire is not dying because it has run its course, but because it is run
by stupid people who keep making critical errors in vitally important
areas of imperial business. Adams famously said of democracy that it
“wastes, exhausts, and murders itself.” Perhaps this is true of
democratic empires and America is now in the murder itself phase.
