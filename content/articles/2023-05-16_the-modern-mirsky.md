In 1904, Prince Pyotr Mirsky was appointed Minister of the Interior by
Tsar Nicholas II, after the previous Minister of the Interior,
Vyacheslav von Plehve, had been assassinated by Jewish revolutionaries.
This was a volatile time in Tsarist Russia, as trust in the system was
at a low. Liberal reformers wanted what they thought the West had in
terms of political freedom. Revolutionaries were conducting terror
campaigns in order to undermine the tsarist system.

For his part, Mirsky was both a reformer and loyal to the Tsarist
system. In his role as Governor-General of Vilna, which is modern day
Lithuania and Belarus, Mirsky implemented liberal reforms like granting
political rights, ending the pogroms against the Jews, and allowing a
degree of autonomy to ethnic minorities. In his role as Minister of the
Interior, he granted freedom of the press, freedom of religion and
increased the power and authority of local self-government.

Mirsky was not a reformer because he had dreams of creating a liberal
paradise to replace tsarist Russia. He was a reformer because he worried
that the lack of reform would result in more radicalism, like the sort
that had claimed the life of his predecessor and the life of the Tsar’s
grandfather. For Mirsky and his supporters within the system, liberal
reform was a way to address some of the issues of the people, while also
maintaining the legitimacy of the tsarist system.

Uncertain times always product men like Mirsky. He was not the only
reformer around Tsar Nicholas before the revolution. There were others
but all of them failed to arrest the process that eventually led to
revolution. Reformers were around the King Louis XVI and among the
aristocracy prior to the French Revolution. They failed for the same
reason Mirsky failed. There were men who feared reform would go too far
and there were those who feared reform would not go far enough.

This is what should come to mind while watching Elon Musk try to
navigate his way through the current crisis. Musk is a reformer at
heart. He bought Twitter because he thought it was drifting away from
its essential purpose which is to allow for free and open debate about
the issues of the day. His inhospitable takeover of the company was
driven by a genuine concern for what is happening in the West. Like all
reformers, Musk fears what could happen if current trends continue.

It may seem a bit odd to compare Musk to Mirsky or any of the other
reformers who existed in revolutionary times. After all, Musk is the
world’s richest man. In the managerial age, however, that only buys a
seat at the table. The nine other men in the top-10 richest list are
worth five times Musk combined. Apple has a hedge fund that is ten times
the wealth of Musk. Blackrock controls trillions in assets and has
unlimited access to the highest reaches of government.

While Musk may be the world’s richest man and the most famous of the
plutocracy, he is just one voice among many. The managerial elite is
thousands, and the managerial class is millions of people. This new
class is analogous to the aristocratic classes that existed in 18th
century France and 19th century Russia. The best Musk or any liberal
reformer can do is influence the people in the system. This is what Musk
is attempting with his mild reforms of Twitter.

In this illiberal age, Elon Musk has appointed himself to be the
minister of speech on-line and is attempting to roll back the
reactionary controls that were put in place by the ruling class over the
last decade. While Twitter is not the internet of old, Musk has rolled
back much of the censorship. He still bans certain accounts, mostly as a
way to tell the reactionaries that his reforms will not go too far.
Otherwise, he has had a light hand on the censorship of his platform.

This is where that old revolutionary vice shows its jaws. The side that
fears the reforms will go too far has successfully organized an
advertising boycott. State sanctioned pressure groups like Media Matters
have organized other pressure groups to harass companies that were
advertising on Twitter. Those companies dropped their ads, resulting in
a fifty percent decline in ad revenue. Musk has been forced to hire a
girl boss approved by the reactionaries to be his new CEO.

Meanwhile, the other jaw of the vice sees what is happening and assumes
Musk will eventually be brought to heel. Open sites like Gab continue to
flourish, building on the alternative platform model. Amusingly and a
bit ironically, the hard-core censors are abandoning Twitter for the
opposite reason. Mass media companies, no longer assured of artificial
reach on Twitter, are also jumping ship. Musk is facing the same dilemma
all reformers face when taking the middle position.

On January 22, 1905, soldiers of the Imperial Guard fired on
demonstrators in Saint Petersburg as they marched towards the Winter
Palace. Hundreds were killed and thousands were arrested in what came to
be known as Bloody Sunday. Mirsky denied having any role in it, but he
was blamed by his conservative opponents, as well as the radical
opponents of his half-measures. Mirsky did the honorable thing and
resigned from his office and retired from politics.

In the end, Mirsky was like all prior reformers in that he was both
right and wrong about what was happening. He was correct that radicalism
was spreading due to the inability of the system to address the issues
of the times. He was wrong in thinking that the solutions to the
problems of the system could be found in the system. Just as there was
no saving King Louis XVI and the old order, there was no saving Tsar
Nicholas II and the system that made him possible.

This is where liberal reformers like Musk find themselves. On the one
hand, they are correct in fearing a rising tide of radicalism. He
rightly sees that it is driven in part by the abuses of the ruling
class, of which he is a part. The trouble is the system cannot withstand
open debate. It cannot risk questioning the shibboleths that sustain the
moral framework at the heart of the managerial system. In the end,
reformers will be crushed by that old vice that has destroyed prior
reformers.
