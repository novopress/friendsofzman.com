In his book, *The Collapse of Complex Societies*, Joseph Tainter argues
that societies collapse when their investment is sustaining their
societies reaches the point of diminishing returns. The complex systems
they evolved to solve the problems they have faced come with a cost.
Complexity itself brings a cost, as maintaining any complex system has
special requirements. These costs are not fixed. They increase over time
and at some point, they exceed the benefits.

In modern life, this is obvious in software systems. They are initially
created to solve a specific set of problems like accounting or tracking
parts in a warehouse. Over time they become increasing complicated as
they are expanded to solve other problems like tracking costs or
forecasting cash flows. They are patched, upgraded and modified
continuously until they reach a point where the cost of maintaining them
is greater than the cost of replacing them with something new.

This idea of diminishing returns is useful in thinking about how the
custodial state is evolving and how it will end. There is a cost to
making sure you are not using the wrong pronouns or teaching your kids
the wrong values. There is a cost to bullying people into taking certain
medicines or avoiding certain foods. Of course, there is a cost to
dreaming up these new taboos. The American university system, which is
the primary source of production for this stuff, is not cheap.

In prior societies, the care, custody and control of the population was
not much of a concern to the ruling class. The duty of the king, for
example, was to make sure his lands were safe from threats. Otherwise,
his people were on their own as far as raising crops and managing their
affairs. They had duties to their lord, but those were in terms of labor
and produce. The church made sure everyone followed the cultural rules,
but the cost of that was paid for through rents as well.

Even in liberal societies of the 19th and early 20th century, the people
in charge did not invest much into making sure people had the right
thoughts. Public education was focused on improving the workforce.
Public safety was about securing the property and safety of rich people.
Public administration was still largely focused on collecting taxes for
the state. In 19th century America, social reform was a private affair,
financed by the wealthy as a form of public piety.

It is in the 20th century things began to change. Public education
became universal in the West and shifted from the basics to moral and
social conditioning. When politicians say that parents should have no
role in the training of their children, this is not the radical idea
that many claim. Inside the ruling class, this is just assumed and has
been for a very long time. A century ago, Progressive reformers assumed
education was necessary to train people to be good social democrats.

The little light on the dashboard of your car telling you that you are
too close to another car and the warnings about drinking the contents of
the shampoo bottle are all part of the custodial state and they come
with a cost. The federal government spent over six trillion dollars in
fiscal year 2021. That is 30% of the GDP. State and local government
spent another three trillion. Roughly half of the U.S. GDP is consumed
with the cost of governance. This is true throughout the West.

This is not the end of it. Regulatory costs do not show up in the
government budget, but they show up in private budgets. When companies
impose vaccine mandates, they are incurring a real cost. Some percentage
of their workforce will quit. The cost of hiring and training employees
is substantial. Then there is the cost of making sure everyone has the
Nth booster shot. This is just one example, but there are thousands of
these sorts of costs incurred by every business.

One way the managerial system has made this work is through socializing
the costs around the world via the currency. The U.S. exports the cost
through dollar production and trade. They create money which is spent on
foreign goods. This exports the inflation to the foreign producer, but
some of it comes back as foreign investment in government bonds and
equities. American asset values go up while the quality of life goes up
without causing domestic inflation.

This is one reason European consumer culture lagged behind America. The
individual countries with their own currencies could not do this trick.
Once the Euro was in place, consumerism in Europe took off. The consumer
culture of the West, a feature of the custodial state, was made possible
by shifting costs to low cost countries in the newly “free” east, South
America and Asia. The spike in inflation suggests this has run its
course and the West can no longer export the cost of custodialism.

The problem we see with Covid, is the custodial state comes with an
ideology that justifies it and drives its development. Covid was a real
problem, but the system wildly overreacted because it exists to manage
these problems to an ever increasing level of detail that has now taken
on a life of its own. The extreme example of this is New Zealand, where
the ditzy Prime Minister has said that her Covid tyranny is now a
permanent feature of life. She is the Kiwi den mother.

Another problem in addition to the direct cost is the cost of what
managerialism does to the population of a society. Public services are
declining rapidly as the people in those jobs no longer feel any duty to
them. Like children shirking their chores, people in the custodial state
stop caring about their work. The great Covid sick out we are
experiencing is a glimpse of things to come. If your needs are the
responsibility of the custodial state, why should you work hard and be
conscientious?

One of the realities of Soviet communism was that it was more expensive
to maintain than it was worth. It was a system that had a 70-year run
and if you net out the years through the war, it was a two generation
system, give or take. There have been kings that have served longer. The
reason it was short-lived is it turned social capital into the fuel to
maintain the system. Worse yet, it consumed the means of producing
social capital, which accelerated the collapse of the system.

The Western system took longer to form up than communism. Its
development was retarded by the necessity of the Cold War. In the thirty
years since the end of communisms the custodial system has evolved
quickly. Along with it the social costs have gone up and the stock of
social capital has declined. In the 1980’s, no one saw the collapse of
the Soviet empire coming, but the signs were there. Similarly, Western
custodialism is headed to collapse for the same reason.
