Taking some of my own advice from last week’s show, this week’s show is
a bit of deep dive into the subcultures of the Left. This is one of
those shows where I had to leave a ton of stuff on the cutting room
floor. It is not so much that they have a rich intellectual history or
have interesting things to say, but that it is hard to summarize the
jumble of ideas that make up these subcultures. This is especially true
of the postmodern or woke Left, which is a dog’s breakfast of ideas and
concepts.

Putting it together, I was reminded of when I read Frédéric Bastiat, the
19th century French economic journalist. It occurred to me that once you
disconnect from the hard reality of human relations, the train of
thought must inevitably lead to ideas that are sharply at odds with
reality. As with Bastiat, the intellectual traditions that underpin the
modern Left work only if you forget the nature of man. Otherwise, they
lack maturity and seriousness and read more like fantasy novels.

The other thing I was reminded of when studying up on this stuff is that
most of it takes great care to avoid addressing the moral assertion at
the core. That assumption is that it is inherently immoral for European
societies to organize themselves in the best interest of the people who
make up the society. This is the assumption of Marx. The French workers
cannot organize in the best interest of French workers. They must
organize, like all workers, in the best interests of workers everywhere.

It is not hard to locate the source of this in Marx. The interesting
thing is how the tides of history made it the default assumption in the
West. The two great industrial wars of the last century delegitimized
nationalism. This left the two internationalist ideologies as the
default ideologies. This is the source of the current crisis. The
universal open society has never been tested intellectually or
practically. Like the experiment with Bolshevism, it is proving to be an
unworkable set of assumptions.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
