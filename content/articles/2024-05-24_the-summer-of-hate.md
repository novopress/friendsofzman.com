**Note:** Because it is the Friday of the first long weekend of the
summer, I am putting aside the Crayola and recycling some material from
behind the green door so I can get outside and take care of a project
before the rains come. There will be fresh content throughout the
weekend behind the green door. Otherwise, have a wonderful weekend and I
will be back on Monday.

The attempted assassination this week of the Slovakian Prime Minister,
Robert Fico, did not get much attention in American media. Slovakia is a
tiny country tucked away in the eastern most part of what people
consider Europe. Most Americans have no reason to care, but a century
ago few Americans had a reason to care about Sarajevo either. A lot of
history can happen in a small country sometimes.

The reason this could be the case is Slovakia is one of the countries
that exists in the gray zone between East and West. It is part of the
Visegrád Group, a political and cultural alliance of former Soviet
client states. Like Orbán of Hungary, Fico is a nationalist who won
office in the teeth of American efforts. There has been whispers that he
could get regime changed due to his stance on Project Ukraine.

Like Orbán, Fico is an old school anti-communist, which means he is an
anti-ideologue and that means he sees American liberalism with
suspicion. In the Visegrád countries, it has been noted that most of the
leading pro-American liberals used to be communists, with many having
been part of the communist regime. They quickly changed out of their
worker costumes and put on expensive suits.

The guy who tried to kill Fico is described as a leftist, but in the
context of this part of the world that means he is pro-Western. Since
winning election, Fico has been subjected to relentless media campaigns
from American NGO’s criticizing him for his stance on Project Ukraine.
There has been a lot of talk about getting rid of Fico by any means
necessary, a dog whistle for the liberal fanatics.

The reason this may be a foreshadowing of what lies ahead is the
reaction in Western media to the news of the assassination attempt.
Instead of condemning the use of political violence, which would make
sense from the perspective of people wielding power, the popinjays of
the chattering skull circuit smugly suggested that Fico deserved to get
shot and that maybe it was not a terrible thing.

Keep in mind that the people who turn up on regime platforms are
repeating the opinions they hear on the cocktail circuit. This is even
more so with Europe as these are all client states, so much of what
makes up their politics is the solon culture where pretentious people
compete to see who can stake out the cleverest pro-American position
while making it sound European.

The reason this matters is the rhetoric aimed at guys like Orbán and
Fico is the same we hear directed at Trump or any other skeptic of the
liberal project. The first bullet out of the gun, so to speak, is to
label them pro-Putin. Both Orbán and Fico have been given the “Russian
collusion” treatment by the chattering classes. Both are called threats
to “our democracy” for having won elections.

Now think about the situation with Trump. The regime has thrown
everything at the guy over the last two years, but he keeps chugging
along. Not only that, but his popularity is also probably higher now,
and more intense, than when he ran in 2016 or 2020. At the same time,
the liberal hatred for the man is now soul defining. If any means
necessary was justified in 2020, it is even more true in 2024.

This is the dynamic of political violence. We tend to think of political
violence as organized bands of politically motivated actors. Maybe they
are sponsored by the ruling class or opposed to the ruling class, but
they are organized. In reality, most political violence is the result of
disorganized partisans who are set off by inflammatory rhetoric, as we
saw with Black Lives Matter.

The other ingredient to political violence is that the people in charge
become comfortable with it, justifying it when it serves their interests
and overreacting to it when they need an excuse to use power outside the
moral limits. The reaction to the Fico shooting is an example of the
former and the ongoing suppression of J6 protestors is an example of the
latter.

Probably the most important piece of the puzzle is disconfirmation.
Political violence comes from the side that thinks the forces of good
are at risk of losing, so something must be done to turn the tide. Trump
was never supposed to win, so they created the conspiracy theory about
Russian collusion to explain it and when that did not solve the problem,
they resorted to violence.

In the fullness of time, we will look back at the shooting of Republican
politicians at a pickup baseball game in 2017 as the start of the
political violence cycle. James Hodgkinson was an anti-Trump kook, but
the anti-Trump kooks were not shamed by his actions into toning down
their rhetoric. Instead, they shrugged it off and ratcheted up their
attacks on Trump and Trump supporters.

This is why the Fico shooting could be important. We are about to enter
the summer of hate when the regime pulls out all the stops to defeat
Trump. There are hundreds of potential James Hodgkinson types thinking
they could be a hero to their cause by taking their shot. The FBI is
always working up plans to create a green flag event in case the regime
needs to use violence. This could be the kick-off to a wild summer.
