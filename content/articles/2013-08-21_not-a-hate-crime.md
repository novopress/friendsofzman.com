target="_blank">There’s talk of charging the three animals</a> who
hunted down and shot a white kid in Oklahoma with a hate crime.
Obviously it is coming from whites tired of hearing blacks whine about
fake hate crimes like Trayvon Martin. It is the good for the goose/good
for the gander tactic. I’m sympathetic. I’m tired of hearing rich black
people like Obumbles and Oprah piss and moan about racism. Frankly, I’m
tired of race as a subject entirely. The magical thinking is just too
much. As long as we keep pretending it is still 1955 in the South, we
will never have a meaningful conversation about race. In this case, the
animals did not kill the kid because he was white. <a

constitutes 1% of the population and <a
