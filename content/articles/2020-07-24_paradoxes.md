It is impossible to assess your age, at least in the context of prior
ages, as you have perspective on those prior ages that you lack for your
own age. There’s also the fact that you can’t really remember how
something felt. You can remember that some event caused you pain or made
you happy, but you cannot recall the feeling. It is why we have the
expression, “Time heals all wounds.” Still, one cannot help but sense
that this age is peculiar and paradoxical compared to prior ages.

We seem to be at the great confluence of several historical cycles. One
cycle coming to an end is the story of the American empire, which itself
is the final chapters of the the Anglosphere and the Industrial
Revolution. Another is the closing of the post-Cold War interregnum.
We’re also in the final stages of the Enlightenment. Of course, we are
at the dawn of the demographic age. There are probably other historical
cycles ending and beginning, but those are the obvious ones.

As a result, we live in a time of glaring contradictions. Just as
physics seems to have hit a dead end, our own story seems to have
reached a point where it seems impossible to resolve the contradictions
while maintaining the old beliefs. The only thing everyone can agree
upon is the present order is not working. That in itself is a paradox,
because for most of our history, great material excess was the goal.
Just as we have reached that point, everyone is unhappy with the result.

Of course, it is possible that people in prior ages had the same sense,
which is what drove them to alter their trajectory. The great social and
political movements that came into being in the 19th century did not
spring from nothing. Industrialization and urbanization failed to live
up to their promise. The bloody resolutions to those social conflicts in
the 20th century got us to this point, so maybe this is just the natural
cycle of human history. We resolve one conflict in order to confront
another.

Still, it does feel like we are living in an age in which all of the old
truths we have always accepted are being disproved. A third of the
country is out of work, which we were told was an untenable condition,
but no one seems to notice. Revolutions from the top were supposed to be
a clever turn of phrase, not a real thing. Yet, here we are living
through a revolt of the ruling class against the majority population.
The weirdness of this age is something that cannot be dismissed.

That is the value of thinking about paradoxes. They cause you to
reassess your thinking and reconsider old assumptions. The great test of
any theory is reality. This is why libertarianism is nonsense. It exists
only in theory and only in isolation. The defenders of the status quo
have to deal with the fact that in many cases, the reality of liberal
democracy has fallen short of what was promised. In some cases, the
important ones, we seem to be getting the opposite of what was promised.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stitcher</a> for the weirdos.
YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
below.

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
