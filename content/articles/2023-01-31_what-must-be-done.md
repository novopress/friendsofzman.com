A year ago, life was great for Marcus Stokes. He was a young high school
quarterback with offers to play college football. Some of the biggest
names in the sport were calling and texting him. He committed to play
for the Florida Gators, which is one of college football’s major powers.
For a young man in this age, it does not get much better than being a
coveted high school athlete. These days it even comes with the promise
of money, not just coeds and attention from fans.

That all came to a <a
href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/marcus-stokes-former-florida-qb-commit-whose-scholarship-was-pulled-due-to-racial-slur-gets-hbcu-offer/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">halt</a> when video of Marcus Stokes
turned up online singing a popular hip-hop song, which violated the Jim
Snow laws. Even though these songs are broadcast to everyone, even small
children, white people are not allowed to repeat most of the lyrics, not
even acknowledge hearing them. You see, in Jim Snow America, a black guy
can advocate for murder, rape and mayhem, as long as it has a beat, but
a white guy cannot repeat what is said.

The hip-hop song in question contained the magic word and Marcus Stokes
said the word in the video. Immediately agents from the Ministry of
Leukophobia were dispatched to investigate. Once it was determined that
he was white and he had said the magic word, they issued a fatwah
against him, his family and anyone even remotely connected with him. The
University of Florida was instructed to rescind the scholarship offer
and issue mean words about him.

In two syllables, the promising life of Marcus Stokes was ruined. You
see, he violated the most important of Jim Snow laws. It is not the word
he said, it is the context in which he said the magic word. One set of
language laws for black people and another set of language laws for
white people is patently immoral. Not even the most brutal communist
dictatorships went down this road. Theocracies like Iran, Israel and
Saudi Arabia do not have segregated language laws.

The only way the Ministry of Leukophobia can conceal this obvious
problem is by terrorizing white people into thinking there are words
that possess special properties that when uttered out loud, destroy the
white person uttering them. That way, the white people will not notice
who is enforcing these language laws. Instead of asking *who* decided we
have segregated language, or even *why* we have such rules, white people
will just assume it is a force of nature.

In order to make this work, the Ministry of Leukophobia does not limit
itself to confirmed utterances of magic words. In the case of Mitchell
Miller, a professional hockey player <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/07/1134761991/mitchell-miller-boston-bruins-canceled-contract-bullying"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">banned</a> from the sport, the accusation
is that he may have been influenced by a magic word uttered by some
white person at some point somewhere. You see, Miller is accused of have
bullied a sacred person in high school. Clearly, he must have been
motivated by thoughts of the magic word.

Conservatives try to excuse this stuff by blaming the victims or
claiming it is just a temporary moral panic. Maybe they blame social
media for encouraging the mob to pile on these poor saps, who
conservatives are quick to point out deserve everything they have coming
for violating the blasphemy laws. The case of the hockey player makes
clear that there is nothing temporary or spontaneous about this stuff.
It is part of a long term campaign by the Ministry of Leukophobia.

You see this with Marcus Stokes. It has been six months and things
should have blown over by now. He issued as many groveling apologies as
humanly possible. He has no doubt spent the required time at a
reeducation facility. He even found a black person to bless his
transformation and provide a redemption arc. The coach of Albany State,
a historically black college, offered Stokes a scholarship. No doubt the
coach was thinking he could get a good player and lots of applause.

Like Mitchell Miller, there will be no forgivingness for Marcus Stokes.
The Albany State coach was told by the Ministry of Leukophobia that he
could not offer this blasphemer a scholarship or even a place on the
roster. Not only that, they demanded the coach issue an <a
href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/hbcu-coach-apologizes-for-offering-marcus-stokes-ex-florida-qb-commit-who-lost-scholarship-over-racial-slur/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">apology</a>. To whom he is apologizing is
not all that clear, since no one to date has claimed to have been
offended, outside the tyrant class. Of course, that last bit is the key
to all of this stuff.

The question that hangs in the air, the center of recent disputes here
and elsewhere, is how can American society return to civility? Of
course, most of the people attempting to answer it wish the debate to
exist in the abstract, as that allows them to defend arguments that make
no sense in the natural world. Before any of that can be addressed,
however, is the question of whether it is even possible to have a civil,
decent society under the current conditions.

Can <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/writers/austin-nivison/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Austin Nivison</a>, the person stalking
Marcus Stokes, exist in a society that respects the dignity of the
citizens? Can you have a civil society that includes the people who
employ spiteful bigots like that guy? After all, they appear to operate
as a volunteer auxiliary of the Ministry of Leukophobia. How is it
possible for decent people to cohabited with people so filled with
hatred for them? Can anyone reading this imagine being fellow citizens
with people who hate them so much?

Stories like those mentioned here, and there are thousands of less
notorious examples, suggest that we have reached the point of
irreconcilable differences. We have a ruling class that has concluded
that the white population is irredeemably evil. That is, after all, what
is being said about Marcus Stokes. How can anyone with a soul want to
find common ground with someone who seeks to destroy the life of a child
for having repeated a forbidden word in a song?

The answer to the subject of this post starts with acceptance. There is
no magic set of words that will heal the black hearts of the people who
think it is right to torment white kids like we see with these two
examples. We have a population of spiteful mutants, to borrow Ed
Dutton’s phrase. That population has been weaponized. The answer starts
with accepting this reality and then wondering aloud who is doing the
weaponing and for what purpose. The answer starts with questions.
