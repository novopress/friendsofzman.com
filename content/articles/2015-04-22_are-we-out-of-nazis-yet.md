rel="noopener" target="_blank">I saw this linked on Drudge:</a>

*A former SS sergeant described how so many Jews were brought to the
Auschwitz death camp at once that he was put on a 24-hour shift guarding
the ramp where they disembarked from the trains.*

*He told in chilling detail how cattle cars full of Jews were brought to
the Auschwitz death camp, the people stripped of their belongings and
then most led directly into gas chambers.*

*Oskar Groening is being tried on 300,000 counts of accessory to murder,
related to a period between May and July 1944 when around 425,000 Jews
from Hungary were brought to the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex in
Nazi-occupied Poland and most immediately gassed to death.*

*During that period, so many trains were arriving that often two would
have to wait with closed doors as the first was ‘processed,’ Groening
testified at the Lueneburg state court.*

*‘The capacity of the gas chambers and the capacity of the crematoria
were quite limited. Someone said that 5,000 people were processed in 24
hours but I didn’t verify this. I didn’t know,’ he said. ‘For the sake
of order we waited until train 1 was entirely processed and finished.’*

*Auschwitz survivors describe their arrival as chaotic, with Nazi guards
yelling orders, dogs barking and families being ripped apart.*

***But Groening, 93, maintained the opposite**, saying ‘it was very
orderly and not as strenuous’ on the ramp at Birkenau.*

*‘The process was the same as Auschwitz I. The only difference was that
there were no trucks,’ he said during the second day of his trial. ‘They
all walked – some in one direction some, in another direction… to where
the crematoria and gas chambers were.’*

I think there was a strong case for hanging the Nazi leadership after
the war. That’s an easy one. Similarly, hanging the really nasty
officers who committed atrocities was a good idea. After that I just
don’t see the sense in these trials in the aftermath of the war. Hanging
people who took orders strikes me as contrary to western tradition. You
hang the man giving the orders, not the man following them.

Seventy years on, none of this makes any sense to me. This old guy is
93. What do they expect to come of this? He’s going to croak any day
now. These trials are nothing more than guilt porn. They have nothing to
with justice, they never do, and they sure don’t have anything to do
with vengeance. The guy is 93.

I guess we will have to wait for the final Nazi to die in the next few
years. There are only a few thousand left, if that many. The Nazis, in
my view, cast way too long of a shadow. Marx is arguably history’s
greatest monster. At least 100 million were murdered in that prick’s
name. Hitler was a piker compared to the Reds, but Western Progressives
see too much of themselves in the Nazis. Maybe when the last Nazi dies,
the usual suspects will be free.
