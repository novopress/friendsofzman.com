The Middle East has been quiet of late, mostly due to the fighting in
the Ukraine and the economic war being waged against Russia by the West.
The endless squabbles in the Levant have had to take a backseat to
events in Europe. That may be about to change as the looming war between
Iran and Israel inches closer to reality. Some see Biden’s trip to
Israel and Saudi Arabia as a prelude the coming conflict as both
countries have been allies with the United States against Iran.

The main reason to suspect war is closer now than ever is a <a
href="https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/israel-middle-east/articles/who-leaked-israeli-iran-plan"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">leaked document</a> about Israel’s plan
to attack Iran. There is a great deal of mystery around who leaked it
and why, but the assumption is that it is real. The main reason for this
is the Israelis have been actively practicing for an attack on Iran.
They have demonstrated that they have the technical ability to operate
long distance missions deep into Iran to conduct attacks on targets
related to the nuclear program.

Another clue is that the Saudis have started to allow Israeli commercial
aircraft to operate over their airspace. If you look at a map, the best
way for Israel to attack Iran is through Saudi airspace. The other route
is through Syria and Iraq. One reason the IDF keeps attacking Syria is
to test their air defense systems. Syria uses the same Russian SAM
systems as Iran. Ideally, the Israelis would bypass those systems and
only have to deal with the Iranian air defense system.

Of course, the Israelis have been trying to get the United States to
attack Iran since the launch of the crusades against Islam in the Bush
era. Long forgotten, but the scheme advanced by the neoconservatives was
to use Iraq as a staging area to launch a full-scale invasion of Iran.
This made a lot of sense as the United States had a huge army right
there looking for work. The trouble is that army was losing the war with
Iraqi insurgents so the scheme collapsed.

Even since the Israelis have mostly been working to prevent the United
States from cutting a deal with Iran over their nuclear program. They
strongly opposed the deal made by the Obama administration. Most of the
foreign policy establishment opposed it as well, which is why they had
Trump cancel the deal. Biden tried to revive it but his efforts have
been stalled by incompetence. With negotiations off the table, the other
options to stop the Iran nuclear programs are back in play.

This is where events in the Ukraine may play to the advantage of Israel.
It is clear that the Russians will eliminate the Ukrainian army in the
east. It is also clear that the economic war with Russia is a disaster.
The Biden administration could use a change of scenery with regards to
foreign policy. They are looking for some way to put pressure on the
Russians and an attack on her client states in the Middle East could do
that and shift attention away from the Ukrainian debacle.

From the Israeli perspective, an attack on Iran is not cost free, but
the benefits clearly outweigh the liabilities, assuming it works. If
they can destroy Iranian nuclear facilities, the response from Iran will
be worth it. The Iranians could launch missiles into Israel and unleash
their militias in Lebanon and Syria, but they have no way to inflict
corresponding damage to Israel. They would eventually run out of
missiles and the net effect would be a big win for the Israelis.

Washington would most likely use this as a way to pry the Saudis away
from any deal to join BRICS. Iran would know that the Saudis let Israel
“violate their airspace” to conduct the attack so any rapprochement
would come to an end. Washington has used the threat of Iran to keep the
Saudis onboard. An Israeli attack would force the kingdom to renew
cordial relations with America, which would require them to get onboard
the sanctions regime against the Russians.

This may sound like 4-D chess but recall how every TV news anchor was
chanting “Keev” and wearing a Ukrainian flag on their costume in
February. The neocons think long term and they never give up on a
project. They probably have a disinformation campaign ready with claims
about how Iran plans to close the Persian Gulf and attack Saudi oil
supplies. Even if it does not lead to war with Iran, it would shift the
focus from Ukraine and justify the economic war against Russia.

To a normal mind, this is crazy but the people running American foreign
policy thought staring a war with Russia was a good idea. The people who
were sure Russia would run out of missiles after a week are sure an
attack on Iran can work. They are the same people who thought occupying
a place called “the graveyard of empires” for a quarter of a century was
a great idea. In American foreign policy, the more ridiculous the idea
the more likely it is to be embraced.

The other piece of the puzzle is the fact that the United States has
emptied out the warehouses for the Ukrainians. A war involving Israel
would spur Congress to throw billions at the military to restock the
shelves. War is big business and the business of the Global American
Empire is war. It is not hard to imagine a consensus forming around
letting Israel attack Iran when all the people in the room think they
can get rich from the fallout of such an attack.
