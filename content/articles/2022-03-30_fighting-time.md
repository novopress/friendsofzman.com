One of the puzzles from the Great War is how the leaders on both sides
allowed themselves to get drawn into the war. There are plenty of
reasons why each country would want war, including the infamous one that
caused a certain Austrian fellow to coin the term “the big lie.” The
problem with all of the reasons is they made little sense in light of
the obvious costs of war. As a result, the Great War is a great example
of how events can tale on a life of their own.

The remarkable thing about that war is that once it settled into trench
warfare no one realized the hopelessness of it. One can understand how
the initial events would spiral into a global conflict. That is not a
new phenomenon. Similarly, you can see how the initial moves in the war
made a lot of sense to the leaders on both sides. This was the first
industrial war, so they had a lot to learn. New weapons needed new
tactics but few people realized that at the start of the war.

The great puzzle of the war is that the sides did not see the
hopelessness of the situation once in settled into a stalemate. Both
sides were losing tens of thousands of men with each attack, only to
gain a few yards of ground. The Battle of the Marne and the subsequent
race to the sea made sense. The losses were high, but both sides had
hope for quick victory. Two years later the French and Germans lost over
a million men at Verdun and the winner got nothing for their trouble.

A century on and we are getting some fresh insight into why the Western
leaders in the Great War were incapable of seeing things clearly. The
war in Ukraine is proving to be nothing like Western planners imagined.
They assumed the Ukrainians would stall the Russians into a stalemate of
urban warfare. The world would rally to the sanctions regime and it
would quickly be a question of how long the Russians could suffer the
economic consequences of the sanctions.

After just one month it is clear this is not happening. The Russians did
not fight like the NATO planners imagined. Instead of rushing to Kiev,
they pinned the Ukrainian army in the north, using classic maneuver
tactics. Meanwhile their main army is systematically destroying the
Ukrainian army in the south and east. It also appears the Russians were
well prepared for the Ukrainian tactic of digging into urban areas. It
is now just a matter of time before the Ukrainian army in the east is
lost.

That is just one miscalculation by the West, but it should be
concerning. The Russians are not doing anything novel in Ukraine. They
are using classic tactics that have been used in Europe since Napoleon.
Further, they are following a doctrine they evolved in the Second
Chechen war. That was a doctrine Vladimir Putin created as the guy
running that war for Russia. It seems that no one in the west bothered
to study the man they claim is the new Hitler.

That is only one small part of the miscalculation. The decision to
cutoff the Russian central bank appears to have been a massive blunder.
The Russians, faced with the threat of their dollar and Euro assets
being seized by Western banks have told the West they must pay for goods
in rubles. Otherwise, they are forced to send product to the West but
not be paid for it. Alternatively, they would have to make concessions
in order to get their assets unfrozen by the West.

Why anyone in the West thought this was a good idea is a mystery. It
turns out that the Biden administration did not consult with the Federal
Reserve. Europe appears to have just followed along without questioning
the policy. Now that Russia has countered their move, Europe is in a
terrible position. They either support the ruble with massive purchases
or they face an imminent shortage of natural gas. That means
[rationing](https://www.zerohedge.com/energy/germany-scrambles-ration-gas-after-refusing-make-payments-rubles)
of energy products could happen as soon as next month.

Of course, the words “shortage” and “rationing” will trigger the natural
response, which is hording and price gouging. That will also mean a
political response. The German political elite appear to be embracing
their inner Marie Antoinette by
[telling](https://summit.news/2022/03/29/government-minister-tells-germans-to-cope-with-soaring-energy-costs-by-wearing-warmer-sweaters/)
the Germans to wear a sweater as they shiver in the dark. Presumably,
they will tell the people to eat bugs when the food shortages hit this
summer. Maybe German TV will start celebrating the [Turnip
Winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnip_Winter) as a way to
motivate the public.

In fairness, we have to no idea how the Russians and Chinese are viewing
this thing as Western media refuses to cover that aspect. We should
assume the lack of food riots and social unrest in Russia means they are
not teetering on collapse. This was the prediction at the start of this
war. The best and brightest in the American managerial elite <a
href="https://www.americanpurpose.com/blog/fukuyama/preparing-for-defeat/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">predicted</a> the Russians would have
collapsed by now. They also assumed China would be wavering in their
support at this stage.

The point is, we are seeing in real time how supposedly clever political
leaders can stagger from one blunder to the next. Unlike the Great War,
this war has one side that seems to have updated its thinking since the
last century. The Russians are planning for tomorrow, while the West is
planning for 1985. The Biden people actually thought his speech in
Poland would be his [Brandenburg Gate
moment](https://twitchy.com/brettt-3136/2022/03/26/jennifer-rubin-compares-president-bidens-speech-in-poland-to-kennedy-at-the-brandenburg-gate/).
That is the most terrifying event of this crisis so far.

There we see the best parallel to the Great War. The men moving pieces
on the board were men of a prior age. They were trying to fight the old
wars. Similarly, the political leaders were operating in a 19th century
mindset. The trouble was they were armed with 20th century weaponry.
Today, the West is led by 20th century men desperate to maintain 20th
century arrangements. Their opponent is not Russian, China or the new
world order, but the passage of time.
