The word “colonialism” is like many useful words in the English
language, in that it has been tortured by the Left to the point where it
is unrecognizable. A generation ago the Left redefined colonialism to
mean European success. The backwardness of the third world was the
legacy of colonialism. Today colonialism is a synonym for the imaginary
white privilege they see everywhere. Their project now is to decolonize
everything, by which they mean drive off the white people.

Still, colonialism is a useful concept. Since the dawn of human
civilization, those civilizations have been occupying land with settlers
and taking control of settled lands in order to exploit them
economically. The Egyptians, Phoenicians and Greeks spread throughout
the ancient world by setting up colonies. Their people established
settlements outside their home turf and used those settlements to
establish trade routes and spread their cultural influence in the
region.

In the modern day we see a different form of colonialism that reflects
the fact that land is no longer the primary source of wealth. Instead of
setting up camp in the non-white world to exploit their natural
resources, the West now imports the useful portion of these populations
for diversity purposes. Instead of importing ivory and exotic woods from
Africa, Europe now imports the talented tenth from Africa, who
contribute an exotic flair to the professional and university ranks of
Europe.

The fastest growing population of the United States is South Asians,
primarily people from the Indian subcontinent. The population tripled to
six million over the last twenty years and the flow is increasing.
Congress takes every opportunity to make it easier for the professional
ranks of India to come to America. Much of it is under the guise of
temporary worker programs, but like so many words in the English
language, “temporary” means something different now.

Initially, the appetite for South Asian labor was driven by Silicon
Valley. They wanted cheap labor to undermine domestic labor costs. When
they were not <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Tech_Employee_Antitrust_Litigation"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">colluding with one another</a> to
artificially suppress wages, they were colluding to import cheap labor
from India, with the support of the Republican Party. Silicon Valley
liked Indian labor because they spoke English and India was very
accommodating. Chinese programmers are better, but the Chinese
government is not easily exploited.

One result of this brain drain to the West is India has fallen behind
China both politically and economically. The per capita GDP of China is
five times higher than India, despite the fact India is far more open to
Western investment. India has been happy to see their best and brightest
head to the West, while the Chinese keep their smart people at home and
force the West to come to China. Roughly
<a href="https://twitter.com/KhurafatiChopra/status/1343043645306355712"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">half of India’s top talent</a> now lives
in Western countries. That is an enormous loss.

Another consequence of this is playing out in American politics. Indians
have come to dominate the management layer in Silicon Valley. The people
at the top may be from a different tribe, but the next layer down is
<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/9/4590" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">getting very brown</a>. One result is South Asians have
the highest household income in America. Another is they have increasing
influence in the political system. So much so that they essentially
bought Kamala Harris a spot on the Democratic ticket. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Tech_Employee_Antitrust_Litigation"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">She is grateful</a>.

These Indian colonies in the West have created a magnet for Indians back
on the subcontinent, who want to escape their conditions. This opens the
door for the Indians in the West to increase their status and power, by
getting more and more of their people into their new colonies in the
West. It is why both American political parties support unlimited visas
for Indians. The flow of Indian money is now significant, so both
parties are willing to sellout to this rising interest group.

The current population of India is 1.4 billion. If we assume the
talented tenth is able to live and work in the West, that is 140 million
people. If half of those think following their countrymen to Europe and
America is the right thing to do, that is 70 million people ready to hop
a steamer for the West. Of course, we are not just getting the talented
tenth from India, so that is a very conservative number. Then you need
to add in Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

South Asia has a lot of people living in small spaces. Overall, the
countries of South Asia have a population density of 303 people per
square kilometer. The United States has a population density of 36 per
square kilometer. If you are a people jammed into tight quarters,
looking for some elbow room, North America looks like heaven. If that
wide open space is begging you to come and your best people are already
there establishing thriving colonies, the result is obvious.

One irony of this is that for a generation now immigration patriots have
been warning us that the American ruling class is importing a new
people. They did not like ruling over the middle-class white people that
made the country, so they were bringing in new brown people to break the
back of the middle and working class. It also appears that they are
importing a new ruling class too. The affluent Indian colonists are
ready to take their place at the top of the empire now. Kamala Harris
says hello.

This is the ideal moment for this new tribe to flex its muscle as no
group on earth is better at playing identity politics than South Asians.
South Asia has been nothing but identity politics since the
<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6457/eaat7487"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Indo-Aryan invasion</a> of the
subcontinent. India has been one of the most diverse places on earth,
meaning that Indian ruling class has literally been bred to play
identity politics. They now find themselves in an empire convulsed by
identity politics and headed to majority-minority status.

If one wants to look ahead to how the American empire finally starts to
crack, it may very well be at the top, rather than between the top and
the rest. One camp will be the ascendant South Asians, while another
camp will be the remnant of the Judeo-Puritan ruling elite from the last
century. The former will be rooted in their local economic strength,
while the latter will be supported by the Chinese Communist Party. Maybe
some oil money from the Middle East thrown in for flavor.
