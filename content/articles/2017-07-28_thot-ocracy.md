Young males have coined a term for particularly obnoxious type of female
increasingly common today. The term is “thot” which, according to
<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Thot"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Urban Dictionary</a>, is an acronym for
“that ho over there.” That’s probably true, as most kids communicate via
text message these days. Of course, it also sounds a lot like “twat” so
that could be why it caught on with young males. Additionally, the term
means a girl who is a slut, but carries on as if she is special. It’s
the sort of thing that is said to bring someone down a few notches.

Anyway, the word *thot* does not exactly roll off the tongue, but it is
useful shorthand for the type of young woman that has become too common
in our mass media. This is the girl, who would have been standing next
to a Ford at the auto show in another era, but is now put on television
as a serious commentator or journalist. They get the job because of
their looks, but somehow they think they are public intellectuals. This

Mx. Timpf is probably a nice person. I only had a vague recollection of
her so I looked up some clips of her on YouTube.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozbh7FiddLI" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Here’s a longish one</a>. From the photos on line and
her video clips, it appears she figured out that she could work the
naughty librarian look into a paying gig in conservative media. Her bio
says she is a libertarian, but exactly no one gives a damn about her
political views. She’s on TV because she is easy on the eyes and willing
to play the sex kitten on these chat shows. That’s how it works.

There’s nothing new about this, but in the past, the women doing the TV
bimbo roles knew why they were on TV. In fact, many had made it to
television via modeling or beauty pageants. Phyllis George was the
winner of the 1971 Miss America pageant and that got her a gig on CBS as
a sportscaster in 1974. She provided the legs, while gnarly old dudes
like Jimmy the Greek and Brent Musberger talked football. George never
carried on like she was an expert on football. She was eye candy and the
moderator of the show.

Today, young women like Katherine Timpf are walking around thinking they
are where they are because they are important thinkers. The exchange she
had with Colin Flaherty was sadly comical. She picked up some
libertarian talking points and she repeats them, making “criminal
justice reform” her issue. In the old days, the beauty pageant girls
would cast about for a talent that they could use in shows. Today, TV
bimbos cast about for a social cause they can champion on TV, while
showing some leg.

As an aside, notice that what passes for “conservative” these days in
the mass media is basically just Reason Magazine style libertarianism.
It’s about as edgy as these people can muster, for fear of upsetting
Lefty. That’s mostly because all of these outlets are located in New
York or DC. If Timpf wants to keep getting invited to parties and
events, she knows she has to avoid anything that upsets the Progs. The
fact that generic libertarianism gets the good housekeeping seal of
approval is instructive.

Anyway, this meandering post is not supposed to be Timpf-bashing. I’m
sure she is a nice girl who is kind to old people and puppies. The
reason she is in this position to be an example of Dunning-Kruger, is
that the media indulges people like her, allowing her to think she is an
intellectual. In fact, the culture as a whole has been re-engineered
over the last few decades to encourage young girls to wildly over
estimate their abilities. It’s no surprise that we have a couple of
generations of *thots* on our hands.

The rape hoax culture on the college campus is largely due to coeds
thinking they can do all the things boys can do, like get knee-walking
drunk down at the bar. A man wakes up next to a strange women, he just
assumes he was on his game. A women wakes up with her panties on her
head and she is looking for someone to blame. After all, she has been
told her whole life that the world is here to cater to her whims. Chad
Thundercock down at the bar should have known she was going to change
her mind after she got sober.

The conflict between how women are trained and biological reality could
be one cause of the social justice warrior phenomenon. The outbreaks
seem to be in male domains like tech and gaming. The girls show up
expecting the world to bend to their will and when it doesn’t, they
start blaming reality, rather than question their training. The innate
desire for attention, curdles into self-abuse and misdirected anger at
males. That’s a half-baked theory, but it is just as plausible
as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasmosis" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">toxoplasmosis</a>.

It is hard to see how this cycle of madness ends. <a
href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/449819/katherine-timpf-fox-news-man-dumped-water-targeted-attack"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">The reaction of Timpf</a> to being
assaulted the other day suggests that no amount of reality will beat any
sense into these women. Being self-absorbed and stupid pays too well.
Even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Pao" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">the ugly ones</a> get to work the system to live well
above what their talents should warrant. Whether we like it or not, the
future, at least for a little while, will be a thot-ocracy. American
society will be dominated by airhead bimbos who think a pair of
librarian glasses makes them an intellectual.
