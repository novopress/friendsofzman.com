Way back when the Democratic Party stepped into to halt their voters
from picking the wrong option, the immediate response from most
observers was that Biden would be a caretaker president if he won. Most
people, of course, assumed a man with serious cognitive decline was
never going to win election, but 2020 was a good reminder that
authoritarian regimes have no respect for the general will. Biden was
installed as the short-term answer to their Trump problem.

How long he lasted was assumed to be a function of his ability to stand
up and read the lines provided by the script writers. The “long Biden”
camp said he would serve out his term, but not run for re-election.
Harris or maybe someone else would be the nominee for 2024 with his
blessing. The “short-Biden” camp said he would be lucky to make it to
the midterm. His cognitive decline would become so obvious that he would
be forced out one way or another and Harris would take over.

There was always another element to the politics that was pushed to the
background in the excitement to depose Trump. The left-liberals have not
been unified in a long time and the Biden-Harris ticket was a compromise
between the two main factions. The one faction is the Obama side. If you
look at the people around Biden in his campaign and his White House,
they are mostly Obama loyalists. On the other hand, Harris was
surrounded by Clinton people and remains so as VP.

The Biden-Harris ticket was not only a compromise, but a way to secure
the support of the semi-permanent arm of the party, by freezing out the
socialists. The apparatchiks would side with Trump before siding with
Sanders. They could control Trump on the things that mattered to them.
There was no telling what Sanders would do. What Biden-Harris promised
to the apparatchiks was a return to the old order, so they would move
heaven and earth to get them past public opposition.

Just as the exit from Afghanistan has not followed the script, the
Biden-Harris compromise has not worked as hoped. Team Biden is proving
to be far more radical than Washington expected. Their Carter-esque
domestic agenda is reminding a lot of people of the 1970’s. Serious
retail inflation is not transient after all. Instead, it is becoming a
part of the public’s calculus. Retail spending has dropped this summer
as people adjust to a world of rising prices for essentials.

Then you have the Covid panic which the script said was supposed to end
in the summer, in time for Independence Day. They could call it the
Trump plague and pretend that Biden had magically cured the nation of
this affliction. It is easy to forget that Biden promised it would all
be over by July. Instead, the crazies have turned it into a positional
good to signal their allegiance to the new religion. This promises to
set off more economic and social chaos this fall with new mandates.

The Harris side of the team has been slowly trying to pivot away from
what the Biden side has been doing on a wide range of things. Note how
hard they worked to keep her away from the border crisis. They see that
as a disaster created by the Biden people, so they are hoping to leave
that tar baby where it belongs. On the other hand, the Biden side is
making sure to keep Harris from getting any positive press. They have
been spreading rumors about her in the media to dirty her up.

This friction within the left-liberal wing of the political side of the
party would not matter very much if not for the Afghan disaster. While
normal people are happy to be free of that mess, the party is roiling
over the fall out. The regime media is now full of attacks on the Biden
wing. Here is a
[piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/17/us/politics/afghanistan-intelligence-biden-administration.html)
in the NY Times putting the blame for the collapse on the Biden people.
There are stories like
[this](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trying-and-failing-to-save-the-family-of-the-afghan-who-saved-me)
all over regime media, painting a sad picture of how Team Biden let down
the Afghans.

To sum up, the Afghan debacle has not only increased the tensions within
the Biden-Harris coalition, but it has driven a wedge between that
coalition and the apparatchiks who do most of the governing. There were
leaked stories about how the Harris people were talking openly about the
25th Amendment. Even if true, they will need the support of the
apparatchiks as well as congressional Democrats. They can’t just bust
into the Oval Office and seize control of the state.

What this summer has shown is the “short Biden” people were probably
right about how long Biden remains in office. His condition is so bad he
is rarely seen. That is not going to get better. You can be sure the
Clintonistas surrounding Harris are scheming with their old friends in
the semi-permanent side of the party to engineer a coup to remove Biden
sooner rather than later. Recall that the State Department is filled
with Clinton loyalists, and they opposed the Afghan withdraw.

The question is when and how is Biden sidelined? If you wanted to give
Harris the best chance at reelection, sooner is better than later. This
would provide her time to consolidate her hold over the party. On the
other hand, if Biden were to drop dead in office, everyone could pretend
it was an outpouring of love for him that swept the left-liberals to
victory in the midterms. That assumes the full support of the
apparatchiks to make sure the vote goes as expected.

The Biden people are not without their options. The one important card
they have is that Harris is a weird blend of stupidity and
offensiveness. She had all the resources one could want in the primary
and managed to drive her own popularity down to zero by simply being
herself. Having a dementia patient in the White House is manageable but
a bitter ingrate with a chip on her shoulder is a problem. Putting angry
DMV lady in the Oval Office could turn out to be bigger disaster than
Afghanistan.

Of course, the other option is to find a way to remove Harris first and
replace her with someone the party can trust. Then they can pillow Biden
before the midterm and run the sympathy script they have ready. This is
one of those three cushion shots that makes sense until you think about
the options to replace Harris. It reveals the bigger problem with the
party. They have run out of people with the minimum of competence, which
is how they ended up with Mumbly Joe in the White House.
