The drawbridge effect is a phenomenon often noted by bad
thinkers. That’s where a group of over-class types gentrify a formerly
beaten down area. Once it gets going, they begin to raise the drawbridge
to keep out the hoi polloi. That usually means jacking up property
taxes, layering on building regulations and limiting development. The
city of Cambridge Massachusetts is a good example. Try building a house
or building an apartment building in that city and you will be met with
waves of regulators and community activists.

That’s why the population of <a

1950</a>.

We may be seeing something similar in the world of college sports. <a

this case, the big five conferences have hoovered up all of the good
properties. They have left the undesirable properties in what they call
the mid-major conferences. All of the conference commissioners have
indicated two things. One is they are no longer interested in adding
teams. The other thing is they now want special rules for themselves.
They are, after all, the elite and being elite means not abiding by the
rules

In America these days, there is one set of laws for the prols and
another set for the people in charge. As we see in college sports, the
people at the top lock in place a set of rules that give them the bulk
of social benefits. Those same rules will spread the costs onto everyone
else and make it impossible for the prols to compete. The drawbridge is
the set of rules and regulations promulgated by the people in charge.
Throughout America, the sound you hear is the raising of the drawbridge.
What matters is which side you’re on.
