There is a word in German, *fremdschämen*, which roughly means to be
embarrassed by seeing stranger say or do something embarrassing, like be
drunk in public or behave foolishly on television. The notoriously shy
Finns have the word *myötähäpeä* that means roughly the same thing. The
“second-hand shame” concept is probably something that is exclusive to
northern Europeans, but I don’t know. I do know that whenever I watch
good whites crash into the reality of race, I feel *myötähäpeä*.

That came to mind reading <a

Notice the line “if white players got a big edge in support — this would
clearly be bad news.” Then a little later the line “I think it’s great
that members of minority groups who face discrimination in many aspects
of their lives show strong support for other members of the group.” The
writer suddenly finds himself bobbing around like a cork on a sea of
uncertainty as everything he knew about whites and blacks is now
suddenly invalidated by reality. Watching the poor slob stagger to the
finish filled me with *fremdschämen*.

The commenters on Cowen’s blog mostly sought to dodge the central issue
of the story, which is that blacks shamelessly practice racial
solidarity, while whites do not. That bit of reality contradicts the
narrative of modern American life, which is that the great struggle is
against white racism toward blacks. Obviously data that shows that
whites not only harbor little animus towards blacks, but favor blacks
over their own, turns the world on its head. Throw in the fact that
blacks are wildly racist and suddenly life is not worth living.

Thirty years ago I worked with a black guy in Boston who was a Laker
fan. He was a Laker fan for the same reason all black basketball fans
were Laker fans, regardless of their home city. The Lakers were the
black team opposing the white Celtics. Plenty of whites cheered for
Magic Johnson and plenty of whites rooted against both teams, but blacks
everywhere cheered for Magic Johnson and the Showtime Lakers because
they epitomized black basketball *and* opposed the very white Celtics.

Before my time, blacks rallied to Mohamed Ali versus Joe Frazier mostly
because Ali was flamboyantly black, but also because he was anti-white.
Frazier being favored by whites only added to it. The truth is, blacks
don’t really like white people very much. It’s not a Malcolm X hatred,
but the consequence of ethnic solidarity. Black people prefer blacks
over whites. They see whites as the rival gang, the other team, so they
always root for the black guy over the white guy.This is perfectly
normal.

Humans are tribal so we side with those in our tribe over those outside
our tribe. It’s a basic survival strategy that worked pretty well until
recent. American whites no longer seem to possess this quality. A couple
of generations of propaganda against racism has made most white people
so allergic to anything that resembles ethnic or racial solidarity, most
whites instinctively prefer those outside their group. It’s why a black
sports star will get so much support from white fans, even if <a
href="http://www.mtv.com/news/2020342/lebron-james-i-cant-breathe-kyrie-irving-brooklyn/"
target="_blank">he is openly hostile to while people</a>.

Progressives are baffled by this mostly because the central narrative of
their cult holds that the great struggle is against white racism
directed at the noble black man. Poor Seth Stephens-Davidowitz started
his project sure he would find proof of the “systemic racism” he learned
about in school during story time. Instead he stumbled onto a horrible
secret that may haunt his dreams forever. Or maybe not. Being in a cult
means having the ability to process disconfirmation and still maintain
belief in the one true faith.
