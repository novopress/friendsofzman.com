There is an old expression that has fallen out of favor in the
post-scarcity age, but it may be the key to understanding the current
crisis. That expression is, “Idle hands do the Devil’s work.” When
people do not have anything productive and useful to do with their time,
they are more likely to get involved in trouble and criminality. A
variant of this is “The Devil makes work for idle hands.” The idea there
is if you want to avoid Old Scratch, then make sure you keep yourself
useful to God.

The source of these proverbs is unknown, but variations of them go back
to the early middle ages, so it is probable they evolved with
Christianity. It is not unreasonable to think the idea is universal to
civilization. After all, every human society has had to deal with the
idle, lazy, and troublesome. Making sure these people are kept too busy
to cause trouble is one of those primary challenges of civilization.
Every ruler has known that too many idle young men is bad for his rule.

Even in the smaller context, this is something we instinctively know. In
the workplace, people with too much free time get into trouble. If the
IT staff has too much free time, they start tinkering around with the
stuff that is working and before long that stuff stops working and the
system goes down. A big part of what goes on inside the schools is to
keep the kids and the teachers busy. Home schoolers have known for years
that the learning content is just a few hours a day. The rest is busy
work.

The point here is that people of all ages need a purpose, something that
occupies their mind and their time. If something useful and productive
is not filling that need, then something useless or unproductive will
fill the void. For most people this may be a hobby or leisure activity.
For others, it often means a useless activity is turned into something
important. Elevating the mundane to the level of the critical and then
creating drama around the performance of the mundane activity.

This is what we see in our political class. The ruling class of every
society has a ceremonial role, a procedural role, and a practical role.
Outside of a crisis like a war or natural disaster, the political class
is performing its duties in the same way a line worker in a factory
preforms his role. In popular government this means the pol shows up at
public events. He performs the tasks his office requires like signing
papers and casting votes. He helps grease the wheels when they need
grease.

Into the 20th century, most of our political offices were part-time
jobs. State legislatures met for a short period during the year.
Otherwise, the legislators were back home doing their jobs. Executive
positions like governor and president were fulltime jobs, as they were
in charge of the civil service and in the case of president,
commander-in-chief of the military. Within living memory, Washington DC
would empty out in the spring and remain empty until the fall when
Congress returned.

What we see today is politics at all levels has become a full-time job,
but one with less to do when it was considered a part-time job.
Congress, for example, is something close to a 24-hour drama now. The
politicians and their retinues are now doing politics as a full-time
obsession. Yet almost all of what they do is unnecessary. In fact, much
of what they do is harmful. Very few things passed by Congress enjoy the
support of the majority of the people or even a large plurality.

It is not just that these part-time jobs have been made into full-time
obsessions. It is that much of what we used to need from government is
now filled by individuals, ad hoc networks, and the private sector. Much
of what government does is actually done by private contractors on
government contracts. One of the ironies of the post-Cold War world is
that the federal workforce has declined relative to the population,
while the number of people employed in politics has gone up.

Then there is the fact that much of what government does could be
automated or simply eliminated entirely. The services that are required
like renewing licenses and paying fees can all be automated. In many
cases they have been, but that did not result in fewer people, as we see
in the dreaded private sector. Instead, it resulted in more idle hands
looking for a purpose. On the political side, much of what Congress does
could also be eliminated or automated.

What has happened in the last 30 years is we have grown the idle class
at the top of our society and while decreasing their necessity. Much of
what goes on in our politics is make work designed to get public
attention. Think about it. If the cable news channels were shuttered and
the social media platforms run by the oligarchs were closed, what would
change in America? Nothing of practical importance. Our world would get
quieter and there would be a boom in forgotten hobbies.

American political culture evolved during the Cold War to fight
communism and prevent a nuclear war. Those were important tasks that
occupied the minds and hands of the political class. Once those things
went away, those idle hands searched about for a new crisis. Health
care, Gaia worship, Islam and now invisible Nazis have been used to keep
the idle hands of the political class busy. In the process, the
political class has been driven mad and is threatening the rest of
society.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
