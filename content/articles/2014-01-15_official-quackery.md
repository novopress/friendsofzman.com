The abuse of science is so common, hardly anyone notices. It’s not the
abuse of science itself, but more the appropriation of the language of
science. This is always done as an effort to fool people into believing
things that are not based in fact. People tend to trust science, so if
you couch an idea in the language of science, they will tend to accept
it, even if it is a little nutty. As a result,
j<span style="line-height: 1.625;">unk science turns up all over the
place. </span><a

*The awards would vary based on an ex-player’s age and diagnosis. **A
younger retiree with Lou Gehrig’s disease** would get $5 million, those
with serious dementia cases would get $3 million, and an 80-year-old
with early dementia would get $25,000. Retirees without symptoms would
get baseline screening and follow-up care if needed.*

The science supporting concussion is not strong. It has been known for a
century, at least, that repeated blows to the head can be damaging to
the brain. Boxers have been called “punchy” for at least a century. The
degree of causality has never been established, as most boxers start out
rather slow witted. There’s really no way to know if taking blows to the
head cases dementia, using statistics, because you cannot have a control
group that mirrors the experimental group. You need more than
correlations.

The CTE hysteria of today is based entirely on the worst sort of
observational science, along with endless media hype. That is, the
people trying to ban football claim they see a higher incidence of brain
related disease among football players than the general public. Well,
there’s also a higher incidence of college diplomas and advanced
degrees. That’s right, football players are awarded advanced degrees at
higher rates than non-football players. No one is claiming football
*causes* pursuit of college credentials.

That’s the difference between correlation and causation. Correlation can
be a clue to causalities that are unknown. They can also be meaningless.
While it seems reasonable that there are long term costs to playing a
sporty that is as physically damaging as football, controlling for all
of the environmental and genetic factors is impossible, at least with
regards to this issue. Maybe people prone to dementia are also risk
takers, and thus engage in high risk hobbies like playing football or
boxing.

To now claim that ALS is caused by football is bordering on insanity.
ALS is most certainly a genetic disorder. There’s some evidence of
inheritance, but that’s only clear in about 10% of the cases. The nature
of the disease, however, strongly suggests a genetic defect. There’s no
evidence that environmental factors are the cause. It’s not just that it
clouds the research into head trauma, but i pollutes the research into
ALS. It’s a fraud on the public that can have real costs to real people
in medical danger.
