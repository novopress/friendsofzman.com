If you are one of the tens of millions who voted for Trump in two
elections, you are probably a bit puzzled by what is happening in
“right-wing” media. If you have made the journey to this side of the
great divide over the last decade, the distance between where you are
now and those old voices on the Right seems much greater. It is one of
those undiscussed aspects of the war in Europe. The great divide between
the Cloud People and Dirt People has grown wider.

Right-wing talk radio which largely serves the over-sixty crowd now
sounds a lot like it did in the 1990’s during the Balkan conflict. Back
then they were demanding troops on the ground rather than the limited
use of air power by Clinton. He was Neville Chamberlain and Slobodan
Milošević was the new Hitler. Today the Sean Hannity types are demanding
an invasion of Russia because this time Joe Biden is Chamberlain and
Vladimir Putin is Hitler.

It is not just mainstream conservatism that has pulled out the old
outfits from yesterday in order to indulge in nostalgia. Populist Inc.,
which formed up during the Trump presidency, suddenly sounds like every
neocon nutter, demanding no-fly zones and full-scale economic war. In
many cases, they are racing to out-crazy the neocon crazies on this
issue. It turns out that the America first rhetoric was just a public
relations campaign for the same old conservative grift.

What this reveals is that the people inside the political bubble never
learned anything from the last decade. It brings to mind the famous quip
misattributed to Talleyrand but written by a French naval officer.
“Nobody has been corrected; no one has known to forget, nor yet to learn
anything.” A little more than a year after the great danger was purged
from their ranks, the Cloud People are carrying on as if the world is
right back to where they left it in the fall of 2016.

One of the things forgotten is that people care about practical things
like the condition of their roads, their living standards and the safety
of their communities. They will respond to abstract concepts like
patriotism, for sure, but only if the call to act is in defense of where
they live and how they live. The reason a TV pitchman won the 2016
election was that he spoke about the things that mattered, while his
opponents blathered on about “who we are.”

It seems that the disconnect between the Cloud People and the Dirt
People has managed to grow during the last decade of troubles. This
[post](https://nypost.com/2022/02/28/strange-left-right-alliance-making-excuses-for-putin/)
by one of the zombies of Conservative Inc. is illustrative. Even though
he uses a profile picture from thirty years ago, Kyle Smith is a
middle-aged man. He should be aware that all around him is raging a
weird 1980’s nostalgia. He should also be aware that there has always
been a strong isolationist strain in American politics.

In fact, the default American position until the 20th century was to not
go abroad in search of monsters to destroy. America was the well-wisher
of those seeking their freedom, however they defined it, but otherwise,
the American creed said that the goal of foreign policy was to avoid
getting involved in the affairs of other nations. To go around trying to
set the world right would mean the “fundamental maxims” of our policy
would “insensibly change from *liberty *to *force.”*

Put another way, Kyle Smith does not seem to know much about the country
or the American Right, of which he claims to be a part. He is not alone.
The flagship site of Buckley-style conservatism is equally ridiculous.
Jim Geraghty is their main guy now and he seems to get all of his
information from far-left news sites. This
[post](https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/what-breaks-first-in-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/)
reads like some sort of weird Ukrainian fan fiction. For him and his
fellow travelers, the whole “fake news” thing is long forgotten.

It is not just the right-side of the political class that has learned
nothing from the last decade of populist tumult. Progressive Inc. is now
willing to
[tolerate](https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/house-hold-imminent-vote-ditching-trade-relations-russia-belarus-including-oil-imports)
ten dollar gasoline and bread lines just so they can show their
solidarity with Ukraine. They have suddenly got over their fear of
fascism in order to support actual fascist like the Azov Battalion
fighting in Ukraine. Maybe they will start offering amnesty to J6
prisoners if they agree to wear a Ukrainian lapel pin on TV.

Again, you see people who have learned nothing from the past. In 2016
the people voted for the ultimate protest candidate. Donald Trump was
the anti-candidate who crudely mocked Cloud People values. That was when
gas was under three dollars, the grocery shelves were stuffed with cheap
food and no one had the sniffles. Will the people be more willing to go
along with this lunacy when they now have to worry about paying their
bills every month?

Again, from this side of the great divide, the madness now gripping the
beautiful people with regards to the war seems so alien and strange.
Many can remember getting emotionally drawn into the war fever of the
Bush years only to learn that it was all a big lie perpetrated by people
who were never on your side. To see the same people selling the same
lies from media platforms is confirmation that there is no bridging the
gap that lies between the two sides of the great divide.

The war in Europe and the reaction to it is revealing a truth about the
great divide that is the final step for the dissident. There is no
bridging the gap because there is no reforming the Cloud People. All
that can be done is prepare for the point when reality finally comes
calling for the ruling class. That moment may be upon as prices soar due
to the gears of the New World Order grinding to a halt. Soon, rule by
expert is not going to sound very appealing.
