In the old fantasy game Dungeons & Dragons, there was an alignment
system to plot types of players and characters in terms of their moral
code. For instance, a player that was lawfully good, strictly followed a
moral code, even when that code worked against their self-interest. A
chaotically good character was willing to junk the rules to do what they
believe was the right thing. The former would deport all illegal aliens
because the law required it, but the latter would let them stay as long
as they promised to behave.

That always comes to mind when I read about when a serial killer is
finally caught or <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a libertarian is pulling some

Curious about the moral nullity behind this dog leasing idea, I looked
up Dusty Wunderlich and found that he is not a boiler room operator
living on the edge of society. He is a proud member of the new economy.
<a href="http://www.dustywunderlich.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">He even has his own blog</a>.The values section is the
most entertaining because it is a dog’s breakfast of stuff he picked up
as an undergrad, that he could use to manipulate and take advantage of
people. It is a moral code, even if it leads to immoral ends, which is
why the term “lawful evil” is appropriate.

That’s always the problem with libertarians. They assume that if
something is allowed to be done, it should be done. Since the law allows
this guy to prey on the emotionally vulnerable, in order to get them to
sign off on leasing a casket for their dead granny, then there’s nothing
wrong with it. Since libertarians believe the law should only enforce
contracts, protect private property and provide physical protection,
grifters fleecing the unwitting becomes a feature of society, rather
than a defect.

That’s fine, as far as it goes, which is not very far as few people wish
to live in the transactional hell-scape that is the libertarian
paradise. Humans understand that what holds a society together is the
collection of unwritten rules that we think of as our common morality.
The law rests on the foundation of the common morality. An amoral
grifter like Dusty Wunderlich may be operating within the letter of the
law, but he is living outside the spirit of the law. No society will
tolerate that for long and eventually the law is changed.

The Old Right has always understood this. Societies can evolve unwritten
ways to deal with guys like Dusty Wunderlich. Ostracism or
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Shot_Liberty_Valance"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tom Doniphon</a> are two
examples. Or, they will create written ways to deal with him. The public
will demand it. If the leaders fail to provide the solution, then new
leaders will be found. The Right prefers organic social institutions,
the unwritten rules, while the Left prefers an authoritarian custodial
state, the written rules. Those are the choices and there is no third
choice.

To be fair to libertarians, the old guys like Lew Rockwell and Ron Paul
understood and embraced this reality. They accepted the fact that an
atrophied state would leave a void to be filled by organic social
institutions. The end may not be the libertarian paradise of maximum
liberty. It could lead to a theocracy, like Utah or Massachusetts, but
it would at least result in a set of rules in line with the dispositions
and desires of the citizens. Modern libertarians reject all that and
embrace a form of utopianism.

It is why the Dissident Right should treat modern libertarians like
plague carrying rage zombies. Economics is down stream from culture, far
down stream. The willingness of libertarians to stab the Right in the
back over culture issues just so they can score some rhetorical points
over economics makes them more dangerous than the Left. Every war is a
culture war, even the shooting kind. It is one group aiming to prove
that their gods, their ways, their culture is superior, by imposing it
on others, by any means necessary.

It’s why Buckley Conservatives are a failed movement now. They embraced
the transactionalism of the libertarians, over the traditionalism of the
Old Right. They have spent countless hours fussing over how best to move
commas around the tax code, while the Left is marching from victory to
victory in the culture war. The corruption is so thorough that they can
no longer muster a reason to oppose guys like Dusty Wunderlich, ravaging
the economy like locusts.
