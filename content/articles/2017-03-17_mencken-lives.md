Years ago, reading Jonah Goldberg’s Liberal Fascism, I was struck by a
line early in the book, where he criticized the American Left for not
remembering their own intellectual history. What struck me about it was
that Goldberg seemed to be astonished by this revelation. It is tempting
to think, upon learning something new, that you are the first person to
have the insight. Young people tend to suffer from this, coming home
from college convinced they know the secrets of the universe. In the
case of the Left, Goldberg may have been the last person to notice the
Left’s hatred of the past.

The other thing that was striking is that modern conservatives suffer
from the same defect. Read any of the so-called conservative writers
of the Official Right™ and you get the impression that the world began
in 1938. Every bad guy in the world is Hitler and any hesitation about
rushing into war is appeasement. More important, they think the great
intellectual tradition of the Right starts with the day Bill Buckley
penned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_and_Man_at_Yale"
target="_blank">God and Man at Yale</a>. Everything before that is fairy
tales and mythology from a foreign people.

Of course, this is not an accident. Buckley conservatism was a break
with the old traditional Right, if it was ever actually of the Right,
which is debatable. George Will famously called Buckley’s Yale book “a
lovers’ quarrel with his alma mater.” It was also a good way to describe
the conservatism of Bill Buckley and his followers. It was and still is
a lover’s quarrel with the Left. Put another way, it was the child
admonishing the parent for not living up to the ideals the parent
preached to their children.

To be fair, the Buckleyites borrowed some political objectives from
traditional conservatives, along with some of the language of the Right,
but it was essentially a Progressive heresy over the issue of communism.
It’s why the Buckleyites had exactly zero wins in the culture war. They
never bothered to fight it. Their singular reason to exist was
opposition to communism, foreign and domestic. It’s why after the Cold
War, they declared themselves Big Government Conservatives.

Anyway, Goldberg’s ahistorical view of conservatism came to mind when
reading <a
href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/mencken-for-conservatives/"
target="_blank">this post</a> over at the ironically named The American
Conservative.

The unhinged madhattery on display here is breath taking. The starting
point of Anglo-Saxon conservatism is skepticism, particularly a
skepticism of universalism and Utopian lunacies like Puritanism.
Similarly, the Right has always accepted that humans are a hierarchical
species by nature. Therefore, the structure of society, including the
political system, will always reflect this reality, as it has at all
times and all places. Egalitarianism is a fetish of the Left, not the
Right. Yet, the modern Right now claims it for their own.

Those two paragraphs describe what Buckley Conservatism is today. It is
vinegar drinking prudery, a cartoonish version of Christian piety and
unquestioning reverence for the jingoistic version of American history,
that has little resemblance to reality. Put another way, it is kept men
tut-tutting about manners, droning on about the old church and demanding
you send your sons off to fight pointless wars of choice, claiming it
is your patriotic duty. No wonder its constituency does not extend
beyond the Imperial Capital.

Mencken was a man of his age so much of what he wrote about no longer
has relevance or it strikes the delicate ear of the modern reader as
hate speech. He also wrote a lot and that leads to a degree of
inconsistency and incoherence. When you are writing to be read, your
first goal is to be entertaining, so a degree of logical inconsistency
is inevitable. Even so, Mencken is an important figure to study, because
it is the conservatism of his era that is roaring back in the form of
the populist upheavals we are seeing in our politics.
