When VDare went down for good, I offered to host Radio Derb here and set
it up on the various platforms where people listen to podcasts. Going
forward you will find the legendary John Derbyshire’s weekly podcast
posted here on Saturday, as well as on Rumble, Odysee and the various
podcast networks. It will take a few days for them to approve the new
host, so I will post links when it happens.

For now, if you want to get the show in your favorite podcast app, you
can use the RSS feed I have set up off the Spreaker site. Link below.
Just paste it into the app following their instructions and you are good
to go. Probably by the end of the week it will be on all of the apps,
and you can then find it through their search tool. It should also be on
Amazon and Spotify by the end of the week.
