Yesterday’s post regarding the future of Christianity inadvertently set
off a debate about whether the Bible is fake. Is the collection of books
we call the Bible, anything like the texts the original Christians used
either in written form or as part of the oral tradition while they were
forming up in the first century? Most Christians accept the argument
that the Bible is the product of a long process that started after the
life of Christ and his disciples, while others insist the Gospels are
firsthand accounts.

The flash point in yesterday’s post was the line about the Gospels being
written roughly a century after the events they describe. This should
not be a controversial assertion as the majority of biblical scholars
think the Gospels were likely written between AD 66 and 110 with the
usual uncertainty. That is not a century after the life of Christ, so
that is a bit of an exaggeration, but that has no impact on the general
point. Early Christians were not waving around Bibles, because the Bible
did not exist.

That does not mean the Bible is fake, but it does mean the Bible as we
know it would be a strange thing to early Christians. They would
recognize the stories, as the written texts were no doubt relying on
oral sources. Most scholars think the stories about Christ and his
disciples were part of the proselytizing of early Christians, used to
convince their audience that Jesus was a miraculous figure. The stories
also served as examples for early Christians facing their own
persecution.

The way to view the Gospels is as part of a marketing campaign for the
new religion that also formed the basis of the new religion. After all,
Christianity, like any human organization, had to answer the question,
“Who are we?” and what followed is what must always follow and that is a
collection of rules that define who is inside the group and who is
excluded. Fundamental to being a Christian is accepting that Christ is
the son of God and the symbol of God’s covenant with mankind.

The Gospels as a sales pitch offend some people, but it should not, as
close to half the New Testament is exactly that and no one complains.
The Letters of Paul are clearly intended to support and grow the
Christian audience. While much of the content was written to address
specific theological issues in the early Christian communities, all of
them contain encouragement to believers in the face of persecution,
urging them to live in a godly manner and to spread the faith.

The point being is that much of what we think of as the Bible was
written by men to address the issues faced by early Christians. Like
Christianity itself, those early stories evolved in their telling and
then further evolved as they were written and rewritten as circumstances
warranted. Even the first effort at formalizing these written texts did
not stop this process. The mere act of writing them in Latin meant the
first Bible was different from the first written Gospels.

Of course, the Bible was written by men and then rewritten and edited by
men, which means errors and omissions. Figuring this out is impossible.
Why was the Gospel of Saint Thomas left out of the Bible? Probably
because it was not anywhere near as popular as the Synoptic Gospels.
Maybe early Christian scholars thought there was a whiff of gnostic
heresy in those alleged sayings of Jesus. Whatever the reason, it was
most likely not a question of authenticity.

Not only were whole texts excluded, but parts of the included texts have
been excluded and rewritten since the first efforts to write them down.
This <a
href="https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/new-chapter-bible-was-found-hidden-inside-1750-year-old-text"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">story</a> about a hidden chapter of the
Bible was floating around recently. The media claims are overdone, but
it does reveal that the editing process started soon after the writing
process began and went on for centuries. Much of what we think of as the
Bible is the result of practical decisions within the limits of the age.

This is the primary argument against literalism and sola scriptura. You
cannot accept the Bible as the literal word of God when it was clearly
written and heavily edited by men, with all the errors that come with
man’s actions. Similarly, it cannot be the sole infallible source of
authority for Christian faith and practice when it was compiled by men
who were not infallible. Instead, the Bible is to be viewed as a living
thing within a living Church that adapts to present reality.

The counter to this argument is that as soon as people start talking
about a document as a living thing, they will soon be trying to kill it.
This has been the history of the American republic and the Constitution.
Everyone who speaks about the “living constitution” is plotting to stab
a knife through some part of it. Once people start talking about the
Bible as mere inspiration, it is not long before the leaders are
embracing sodomy while the congregation is talking about converting to
Islam.

Putting aside that debate, the history of the Bible tells us that like
the Church itself, the Bible is part of an evolutionary process.
Christianity did not spread around the globe and survive to this day,
because it was unable to adapt. The Bible itself, with its errors and
omissions, survives because of those errors and omissions. The reason
people can debate this is because of those imperfections. After all,
evolution is driven by defect which turns out to be superior to the
standard.

Perhaps that is what lies ahead for the Church. Maybe a third testament,
perhaps a collection of yet unwritten texts, adapting the core message
of Christ to the modern problems of a technological society, is in the
future. No doubt, there will be people who hate it and long debates
about what should be in included and excluded, but in the end a timeless
message must adapt to the times. It is how we got Mormons. Perhaps for
Christians, there is a Joseph Smith waiting to be born.
