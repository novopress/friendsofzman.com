One of the interesting things about what is happening in Syria is that
it is not just the fall of the government but a collapse of Syrian
society. When Assad fled, everyone in his government went into hiding.
The people running various parts of the system abandoned their posts,
leaving no government at all. The money is worthless, so the economy has
ceased to function.

Then you have the gangs of lunatics running around, supported by your
tax dollars, making sure nothing is working. Now we are getting word
that remnants of the military are forming up into war bands. Soon the
various ethnic and religious groups will do the same and the result will
be a war zone where lightly armed war bands fight with one another for
control of increasingly worthless land.

In other words, Syria collapsed and went from a poorly functioning
country to something like a fallen Bronze Age society. This is not just
the fall of a government but the collapse of everything, which is not
something we often see. The last example is Libya, which was not much a
society before we killed Gaddafi. The most recent example is the
collapse of the Soviet Union three decades ago.

That is the show this week. Societal collapse is a rare thing, but Syria
is a good reminder that it can still happen. The conditions are pretty
similar in all the big examples of collapse. Of course, once you start
thinking about those conditions, the West begins to look a bit fragile.
Syria is also a reminder that collapse always catches people by
surprise, even those causing it.
