Long before the Covid panic, it was obvious to many on the dissident
right that the main problem in the West was a core of true believers.
These are fanatics who are immune to facts and reason, driven by a
desire to pull the roof down on society. On every issue, they seem to
come down on the side of the society wrecking option. The Covid panic
has brought this into stark relief The Covidians are more deadly than
even the exaggerated version of the virus.

The Covidian is a useful case study in how the believer engages with the
world. Since this started back in the spring of 2020, the true believers
have shifted positions, often contradicting yesterday’s deeply held
position, without explanation. The cult leaders seem to have moved along
an authoritarian scale, which at least provides some rationale for their
actions. The rank and file believers, however, have flitted from one
position to another like a <span enable-toggle-animation="true"

ved="2ahUKEwj5s6SE64DzAhUbKVkFHf1fCDwQmpgGegQIHRAD"
data-width="250">murmuration</span> of starlings.

The most recent example is their view on vaccines. In 2020 when Trump
was promising to accelerate the development of a vaccine for Covid, the
true believer was sure vaccine meant “deadly Hitler poison”. Their cult
leaders were on their media platforms swearing to Gaia that they would
never take the Trump serum. After all, there was no way a safe vaccine
could be developed in such a short period. It was just another effort by
Trump to destroy our democracy.

Within hours of Biden being installed, they shifted to swearing that
these vaccines were a perfect defense, an impenetrable defense, against
Covid. If the bulk of the people were vaccinated by spring, the pandemic
would be over as we would quickly hit herd immunity or pretty close to
it. Everyone could go back to normal. The skeptics with whom they agreed
just minutes ago were now QAnon conspiracy nuts. All good people would
be vaccinated and only the crazies would refuse.

There you see the mind of the true believer at work. Theirs is not a
world of facts, reason, and a vast area of uncertainty, as it is with
normal people. Instead, their world is those inside the walls and those
outside the walls. The walls are an abstraction created by the good
people who lead the faithful. Those who are inside the walls are the
good guys, the faithful, while those outside the walls are the bad guys,
the undifferentiated other that is always at war with the faithful.

This hive mentality is not easy to maintain in the face of reality, so
the faithful need a constant stream of reinforcement. In a prior age,
this came from physical gatherings where the believers could affirm
their convictions and have those convictions confirmed by fellow members
of the collective. Churches have always been social groupings as much as
spiritual ones. For those committed to an ideological faith, the need
for spiritual and social reinforcement is no different.

In this age, mass media provides the steady stream of affirmation. It is
not an accident that the hardest thumping crazies on the Left are also
intensively on-line, obsessed with things like Twitter. Social media is
their tether to the collective. The more they remain connected, the more
intense their need to feel connected. The swarming effect of crazies on
social media platforms is not an accident. Like a fish in a school, the
believer gives herself over to the collective whole.

Here is an <a
href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-vaccines-illness-death-risk-1.6171958"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">example</a> of how the mass media feeds
the true believer. Note the exaggerated language like
“hyper-contagious”. The true believer operates in extremes, so this
necessitates the over-the-top description of things. In this case,
describing the variants as increasing dangerous is a way to maintain the
fervor. You see, you must remain vigilant. The evil one is always out
there. If you let down your guard, he will get you with one of his
hyper-contagious variants!

Note also how the definition of vaccine has changed. Since the advent of
vaccines, the concept has been a binary one. If the vaccine worked, your
immune system would be ready to handle the specific virus and prevent
infection. If not, then you would get infected by the virus. Now a
vaccine is something like an amulet. If you are exposed, it protects the
faithful from the workings of Old Scratch. You still get infected and
are contagious, but your soul is pure so you will be safe.

This line is instructive. “Even the sky-high efficacy rates of mRNA
vaccines during clinical trials left a little window of imperfection —
and those trials happened long before this virus evolved to replicate
quicker, spread faster and infect even more unsuspecting human hosts.”
You see, no matter how vigilant you are, there are others who may let
their guard down and give the evil one a chance to strike the innocent.
This is not about you but about the community as a whole.

This is why Joe Biden said the other day that his administration would
protect the vaccinated from the unvaccinated. The tether to biological
reality has been cut and we are now in the world of the true believer.
The words vaccinated and unvaccinated no longer have a medical
definition. To the true believer, those words now mean the anointed and
the benighted. The elect are those who have laminated their vaccine
cards and wear eight masks in the car while driving alone.

This is why pointing out the fascism of Covid passports has not effect.
The true believer needs that display item. They desperately want the
affirmation that comes from holding up their iPhone to be scanned and
the god in the machine confirming that they are one of the chosen. This
is why they celebrate the death of those the mass media claim were
ant-vaxers. Their blood extirpates the evil from the land in the same
way a public sacrifice washes away the sins of the guilt in the blood of
the innocent.

Counterintuitively, Covid may have been a salvation. The fever-rage of
opposition to Trump was channeled into a ridiculous but so far mostly
harmless identity cult built around the coronavirus. We saw the
destructive power of lunatics in a full rage allowed to seek their own
satisfaction. Covid probably saved the country from endless riots and
urban warfare. The real blessing of Covid is that it has given our
crazies a way to get their fix without blowing up the world in the
process.
