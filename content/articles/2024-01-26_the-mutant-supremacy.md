Bit of a weird show this week. Getting close to the big move. As a
result, things are a bit up in the air in my life, so not much time for
planning shows. That means I am winging it until I can get settled into
the new place. That and the day job has some new twists, which always
adds some stress. I am heroically keeping it all together to produce
fine quality dissident content for your listening pleasure.

Kidding aside, the inspiration for the show this week came while
listening to the coverage of the New Hampshire primary. The media really
wanted Haley to have a good night, so they were pumping air into her
tires by having her voters explain why they were voting for the
miserable old witch. None of these people struck me as the sort anyone
would call normal or even stable.

The weirdest of these weirdos were the ones who changed their
registration so they could vote in the Republican primary against Trump.
It means last fall they changed from Democrat to either Republican or
undeclared. They had to have done that by October, so it they were
plotting this months in advance. Think about the sort of nutjob who
would do something like that?

That is the show this week. I ramble on about the various segments of
the voter base and tease out what percentage of the vote is the mutant
portion. The truth is, it is these mutants who make up about ten percent
of the population, but are responsible for ninety percent of the
problems. Unlike the thirteen who do fifty, these people have real power
and cannot be avoided.
