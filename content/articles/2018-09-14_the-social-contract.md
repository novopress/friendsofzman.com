This week I am coming to you live from Copenhagen Denmark. Well, not
live exactly. The show is recorded, as usual. I am posting this from
Denmark and as far as I know, I am very much alive. I have never been to
Copenhagen, so I am looking forward to some exploring, but I suspect I
know the reason this is not a tourist hot spot. So far, the city seems
rather plain, a lot like a Midwestern American city. There is nothing
wrong with plain, but tourists want a hopping city center, real or
manufactured, painted with the local culture.

The one thing I have noticed is that this is hipster hell. I feel like I
am in Portland. Every male has a skinny jeans, bespoke facial hair, and
noticeable ink. Now, this may be true everywhere young white males
congregate. I live in Lagos, so I do not see many hipsters or white
people. Of course, I have yet to see a black person walking around here.
I did see some Muslims and at the airport I swore they had Hispanics
working the maintenance jobs. Maybe they import Spanish or Italians.
Maybe Mexicans are great swimmers.

Since I am here doing some big brain stuff, the show this week will be a
big-brained show, getting into political philosophy. For those with the
small or medium brains, you may want to break out the brain oil before
listening. One thing missing on our side of the great divide is anything
resembling original thinking about politics. It is either criticism of
the mainstream options or romanticism for long gone models. That is not
going to cut it, so I am going to be doing more stuff on alternative
politics and alternative political philosophy.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I am now on
Spotify, so the millennials can tune in when not sobbing over white
privilege and toxic masculinity.
