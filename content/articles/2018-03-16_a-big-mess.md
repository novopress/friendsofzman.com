Some weeks, putting together this podcast is a pleasure. The topics are
easy and the process is smooth. Other weeks, it is a grind. This week it
was a grind. This is not my full-time job, so events can conspire
against me. That’s to be expected. Some weeks, the material is the
problem. That was an issue this week. The news was either depressing or
dull and I just could not come up with alternative material that I found
interesting.

Put the two together and it was pushing a rock up a hill. Every segment
took longer than it should and the result was something less than
inspiring. That’s why we have five short segments and three long ones
this week. I was tempted to just throw in the towel and skip this week,
but there’s something to be learned from struggle. You learn some things
about yourself or the process that you would not learn otherwise. That
and life is struggle.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. Of course, the Hitler Phones are so slow now, you may never
finish. YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a
download link below.
