The show this week was going to be about the religious underpinnings of
what I call the New Religion of the ruling class, but as I was doing it
other things came to mind, so it is more of a survey of the antecedents.
In retrospect I probably should rework the show around that idea, but
that will have to be another show. As a result, this show is more of a
thinking aloud about the roots of social justice.

The odd thing to me is the resistance I see to using the word “religion”
to label this mode of thought that dominates the ruling class. The
behavior of the managerial class ticks the boxes for a theocratic
mindset. The only thing missing is a well-defined god, but all the other
behavior mimics religious fervor. If you replace God with “arc of
history” the puzzle is complete, as far as a religion.

There seems to be two camps that oppose the religion idea. One camp are
Christians who think a religion must have all the things in their form
of Christianity, which means most of Christianity is a false religion.
The other camp is those who cannot move past the idea that people are
motivated by something other than money. In both cases the opposition is
about their own needs and desires.

Regardless, there is a case to be made that what we are seeing is
religious instinct flowing through an ideology. At the end of the show,
I get into this a little bit with the post-Marx culturalism stuff. I
think the best cause and effect argument, however, is the Social Gospel
Movement through Progressivism to the current woke stuff. That strikes
me as a solid evolutionary arc. Maybe that can be a future show.
