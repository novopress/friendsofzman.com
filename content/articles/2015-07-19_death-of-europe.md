target="_blank">The other day I made the point</a> that the the Greek
drama was about erasing countries from the map of Europe. Everyone is
going to pretend for a while that Greece is a real country, but
eventually even the dumbest Greek will figure out that their national
government is meaningless. The real power lies much further north and
they are not all that interested in what the Greek voters have to say
about anything. You don’t have citizens without countries.

The question is how exactly society is going to hold together without
the glue of national sovereignty. You can be loyal to your family, your
tribe and your countrymen because you share a history, biology and
destiny. Loyalty to a committee of technocrats in a glass and steel
office complex in another country seems implausible.

The dreariness of that last paragraph made me think about something
else. That is the fertility rates in Europe. Men have children because
they want someone to remember them and carry on their name and their
ways. I can’t imagine anyone thinking that about the global technocracy.
Looking at the Total Fertility Rates of the Euro nations, I see I’m not
alone.

To put those numbers into perspective, the populations to the south in
Africa and to the east in the Muslim world have TFR’s double the typical
European country. In some case it is four times higher. Demographers put
the replacement rate at 2.1 so France is the only country planning to
stick around for a few more generations. But, those numbers are inflated
by immigrants so the TFR’s are probably lower across the board.

The odds of those numbers turning around are low because of this:

Again, Africa and the Middle East have median ages half that of Europe.
The demographic collapse that is looming over Europe is not going to be
arrested by men wielding spreadsheets. It can only be arrested by men
wielding something else, but the men of Europe are too old to wield much
of anything these days. That and they don’t seem all that interested in
it anyway.

This old Greek proverb comes to mind. “A society grows great when old
men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.” Europe
is at peace and is as prosperous as ever. It’s growing weak because
their old men look around and wonder if it would have been better if
they had never been born. Given <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">the massive wave of migrants hitting
Europe</a>, it’s fair to wonder if the Europeans are just giving up.
