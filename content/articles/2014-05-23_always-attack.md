<a
href="http://dailysurge.com/2014/05/video-al-sharpton-defends-history-hate-one-jew/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This is a good example</a> of
a few things. The video itself is not all that interesting, other than
the fact Sharpton appears to have amnesia. What is interesting is the
value of being on offense in the culture war. Sharpton is a a ridiculous
person, who should be back preaching in a ghetto church, but he is
always on offense. That’s what prevents him from being ejected from the
media. Even so-called conservatives like Sean Hannity, treat the guy
with respect.

As soon as you concede ground to these guys, you lose. That’s why you
always have to be on the offensive.Of course, it helps that Shaprton is
protected by the people in charge, because he is useful in the war on
white people. That’s another important point about Sharpton. Pointing
out his hypocrisy of the hypocrisy of the media for embracing him does
nothing. It’s just another form of groveling. Worse still , it confirms
the morality of Left by claiming Sharpton is violating it.
