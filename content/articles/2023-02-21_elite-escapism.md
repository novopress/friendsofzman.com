In every society there is a gap between the truth the ruling class
asserts and the truth the people experience. This used to be a feature
of Western criticism of the Soviet economic system during the Cold War.
Communist rulers would make claims about their system and critics would
compare that to reality. Today, the obvious gap is in the West where the
ruling class exists in another world. Over the last year this has been
on display when they speak about the war in Ukraine.

Yesterday, the regime sent Joe Biden to visit Kiev, thinking this was
going to be a public relations coup on the anniversary of the war. This
is the New York Times lead
<a href="https://archive.is/tToTz" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">story</a> in which they make him sound like Lenin
crossing into Russia. The Washington Post has a very similar
<a href="https://archive.ph/JHWCn" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">story</a>. They even use the same photo. Obviously, much
of the content was supplied by narrative men in the regime. The point of
these stories is to maintain the sense that victory is at hand!

In reality, Washington coordinated the trip with Moscow so that nothing
bad could happen during Biden’s trip. Serious people in the Pentagon,
who still have contacts in Russia, made sure the Russians knew Biden was
making the trip long before Biden got on the plane to Poland. Those
serious people know Russia does not want a direct war with the West. Two
days before Biden made the trip, social media was buzzing about it, as
word was leaked by both sides.

This public relations stunt was conducted against the backdrop of a
policy that has failed at every turn and now promises to end in
disaster. No one in the ruling class bubble wants to think about that,
so they tell each other stories like this <a
href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/biden-ukraine/673135/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">one</a> from one of the Kagan cult
members. Another cult member chimed in with this <a
href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/biden-trip-ukraine-kyiv/673134/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> in the same publication, now
operated by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Goldberg" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">cult</a>. This <a
href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/bidens-trip-to-kyiv-is-the-ultimate-humiliation-for-putinand-trump"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> in a conspiracy site gave the
kooks out in the fever swamps something to discuss.

There is a theme coming from the cult members, which is aimed at
maintaining the fiction that animates Ukraine policy. That theme is
inevitability. The subtext to these stories is like the quote from the
Terminator movie. The neocons are out there. They cannot be reasoned
with. They do not feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And they absolutely
will not stop, ever, until Russia has been destroyed. You hear that
Europe? Washington will never stop until victory is achieved!

Of course, the reason for this is reality is starting to creep in at the
edges, especially among the Europeans. The stockpiles of old Soviet
weapons are all gone, blown up on the battlefields of Ukraine. The extra
Western weapons have also been used up to the point where many NATO
countries no longer have a functioning army. The German army is back to
using slingers and berserkers. America is no longer able to <a
href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/eu-mulls-ways-ramp-ammunition-production-ukraine-97329217"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">provide</a> Ukraine with enough
ammunition for the war.

What is going on here is that the people inside the bubble created a
glorious story for themselves regarding Russia. The story said that if
they could bait the Russians into war, they just had to sit back and
wait for Russia to collapse. This version of reality created by the cult
was a reboot of the Bolshevik Revolution. This time, war would crack the
Russian regime and the heroes would ride into Moscow to finally exact
their revenge on their ancient enemy.

That has not happened. In fact, it is the American Empire that is now
cracking under the strain of this war of attrition. Western economies
are struggling. There is growing unrest in the public about the
political class. Meanwhile, the Russians have organized themselves for
the long haul. The story Western elites told each other about this war
are falling a part, but rather than face reality they fill their minds
with more versions of the big lie from the biggest of big liars.

This form of elite escapism is not unique to Ukraine policy. This is the
defining feature of our ruling class. When asked about how all of these
magical electric cars will be charged, people like Pete Buttigieg just
reply with some hand waving or maybe say they will supply more sockets.
He has no idea and he has no reason to care, because his world is the
world of fantasy.  The people running energy policy are just as divorced
from reality as the people running foreign policy.

It is not confined to the elites. This is how the managerial class
maintains its sense of identity and cohesion. The answer to the primary
question of life, who are we?, is supplied by the many narratives that
define the managerial class. Whether it is pronouns, support for deviant
sexual practices, saying “keev” all of a sudden or any number of
affectations, the point is to signal membership in the club. For these
people, the answer to the big question is one of the approved
narratives.

This is why the neocons have managed to dominate foreign policy. They
are expert at creating complex narrative structures that provide simple
moral choices for the audience, moral choices that favor their preferred
outcomes. In a society that lives by words, rather than deeds, being
good with words counts for a lot. Robert Kagan tells one side stories
about monsters and heroes, while his wife tells the other side similar
stories, always with the same monsters and heroes.

In the fullness of time, Francis Fukuyama’s seminal <a
href="https://pages.ucsd.edu/~bslantchev/courses/pdf/Fukuyama%20-%20End%20of%20History.pdf"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">essay</a>, *The End of History*, will be
seen as the point at which Western elites became untethered from
reality. For them, history was always a nightmare from which they could
not awake. All of a sudden, the nightmare was over because history was
over. What was ahead was whatever their imaginations could conjure. They
could hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the
evening, criticize after dinner, just as they had a mind.

Much of what constitutes democratic politics in the West is the people
debating with one another about the precise time their rulers wake from
their dream. Surely they will see the folly of making war with Russia.
Maybe this event will do it. Surely they will see the lunacy of banning
fossil fuels. Maybe now they will see it. So far, nothing has worked,
suggesting nothing will work. Elite escapism is now too much a part of
what defines the elite, so their can be no awakening from their dream.
