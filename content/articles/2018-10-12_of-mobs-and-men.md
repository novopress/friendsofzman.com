I have been on the road for most of the last week, but I decided to do a
show anyway, as it seems like a good idea to stick with a regular
schedule. I just got back in town, and I did not have time to prepare
for the podcast, so I am just winging it this week. It sort of worked
out as the media is full of hyperventilating about angry mobs. It is one
of those times where the show wrote itself. The first three stories I
found in the Post were all about the angry left-wing mobs that either
did not exist or were the potent of great happenings.

Even after all these years of following politics I am still impressed
with the hive mentality of the Left. They really are like a school of
fish. When one responds to a threat, all of them respond, as if by
direction from central authority. It is like a highly choreographed
dance of lunacy. There is some degree of direction and coordination, to
be sure, but most of what we see is the loons all responding to what
they see the other loons doing, as they peer out over the hive walls at
the rest of us. it really is incredible and a bit scary.

I go back and forth on what we see happening. This Kavanaugh thing seems
to have poleaxed the establishment GOP. Poor old Lindsey Graham is still
in shock over what the Democrats tried to do. He may never be the same.
On the other hand, the Left is equally stunned that their gambit failed.
This feels like an inflection point, but what comes next is still a
mystery. Maybe after the election the ruling class comes together behind
closed doors to renew their shared hatred of the rest of us. Time will
tell.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I am now on
Spotify, so the millennials can tune in when not sobbing over white
privilege and toxic masculinity.
