The World Cup started off in grand fashion. <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The very first match was
rigged</a> so the host team could notch a victory.

*Croatia coach Niko Kovac said his players “better give it up now and go
home” after Brazil were awarded what looked to be a soft, and crucial,
penalty in their <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">3-1 win</a> in the World Cup
opening game.*

*With the match tied at 1-1 in the second half, Japanese official Yuichi
Nishimura awarded Brazil a contentious spot-kick when striker Fred went
down after a light touch from Croatia centre-back Dejan Lovren.*

*Kovac called the penalty “ridiculous” and said Nishimura was not at the
level to be a referee on the sport’s biggest stage.*

*“If that was a penalty, we should be playing basketball,” Kovac said.
“Those kinds of fouls are penalised there.*

The liberal weenies in the American sporting press who keep telling us
soccer is important never bother to mention that soccer is the most
corrupt sport on earth.
<a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/sports-jan-june13-soccer_02-05/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Here’s a piece</a> on the
rampant cheating and game fixing from PBS.

*Soccer has been tainted in the past by evidence of match fixing. But
European law enforcement officials outlined a complex scandal yesterday
that was enormous in scope and could be deeply damaging to the game’s
reputation.*

*The European Union’s police agency, Europol, said an 18-month
investigation turned up 680 matches suspected of being fixed across the
globe. The games were played between 2008 and 2011. The scandal may have
even involved qualifying matches for the sport’s biggest tournaments,
the World Cup and the European Championships.*

*The probe cited links to criminal networks, including a Singapore-based
crime syndicate. Europol wouldn’t name any of the suspected matches or
individuals, but said it involved more than 400 people in 15 countries.*

That’s in Europe where respect for the law is still kind of important.
Imagine what South America is like. But, that’s the nature of sports.
Sports with a high level of difficulty attract a different sort of
player and a different sort of fan. Soccer is just a bunch of little
guys chasing a ball around. The only way to keep it interesting is
gambling and heavy drinking. Maybe a little hooliganism too.
