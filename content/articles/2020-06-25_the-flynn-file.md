The General Flynn case, after years of judicial stalling, may be finally
coming to an end, as a Federal appeals court <a
href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/24/us-appeals-court-orders-judge-to-dismiss-case-against-michael-flynn.html"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ordered</a> the presiding
judge to dismiss the case. The presiding judge could appeal the ruling
to the full court or even take it to the Supreme Court, but his chance
for success is negligible. Most likely his appeal would be refused, but
it would buy some time. He could also refuse to comply with the writ of
mandamus or stall for time so his prosecutor can file his claims.

The case has been a microcosm of what is going on with our ruling class.
The sheer pettiness of the process reflects a cultural attitude that
exists in the ruling managerial elite that is not seen among the
commoners. This meanness is all over the current revolutionary spasm.
<a href="https://knewz.com/mel-gibson-winona-ryder/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mel Gibson</a> was just
cancelled again for something he may have said 25 years ago. No people
hold a grudge like the chosen people and that sensibility is now an
identifying feature of the managerial class.

In the Flynn case, whatever insults he committed against the Obama
administration appear to be so minor that no one is sure they exist.
Even the neocons are struggling to manufacturer an <a
href="https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/russiagate-obama-iran"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explanation</a> for this
years-long jihad against Flynn. Note that the torments they have
inflicted on him were designed to keep the torment going for as long as
they could do it. Instead of putting him in jail for a year, they were
seeking to keep his case alive forever. Our ruling class is full of
sadists.

Of course, there could be other reasons for trying to keep Flynn in
limbo. This case has revealed the breathtaking corruption of the ruling
class. We now know, for example, that Joe Biden and his son were
extorting the Ukrainian government. Biden admitted as much several
times. He threatened the Ukrainian government with loss of support if
they did not allow his son to work a grift with their energy monopoly.
Another feature of the managerial elite is shameless personal
corruption.

There are other hints here that the delaying action in the Flynn case is
an effort to cover up other things. The recently <a
href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2020/06/24/agent-strzok-cya-memo-strzok-notes-indicate-obama-white-house-involvement-in-targeting-michael-flynn/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released notes</a> from one of
the conspirators in the seditious plot to overturn the 2016 election
point the finger at Obama. Maybe keeping Flynn in legal jeopardy is part
of a scheme to keep him quiet. That’s the other thing about this rotten
ruling class. Nothing is ever on the level with these people and no
grift is too small. They see us as
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHgv4McMJUk"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suckers and chumps</a>.

Another feature of current year America is on display here. That is the
complete and total corruption of the law. General Flynn was framed. That
is abundantly clear, but it will happen in any legal system. The issue
here is that the judge has deliberately and maliciously dragged this
case out as a form of torture. Judge Sullivan is more like an
inquisitor, trying to extract a confession. The system bankrupted Flynn
and ruined his life, mostly because he has come to be viewed as a
heretic.

All over the court system we are seeing judges not only abandon their
role as neutral arbiters of the rules, but aggressively promote their
ideology. The judge in the Roger Stone case, for example, is an
ethnocentric sadist. Compounding it, the managerial class is celebrating
this new judicial temperament. The Wall Street Journal, an allegedly
conservative operation, is
<a href="https://archive.is/wLjqi" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">celebrating</a> the rise of racial paranoia and
vengeance among the black members of the judiciary.

The Flynn case is not all bad news. It costs money to fight the system
the way Flynn has done, which means someone is paying his bills. They
are not just paying his lawyers, but also supporting him while he is in
limbo. Since he has been de-platformed like every other enemy of the
state, it means a rich guy is underwriting this long battle with the
system. Not every plutocrat is happy with what is happening. A
balkanization of the ruling class is slowly underway.

There’s also the fact that the people running this particular scheme and
many of the others associated with the scandal are not very smart. The
prior generation of rulers would have found a more efficient way of
dealing with a problem like Flynn. They probably would have bribed him
with a position in the system. No man is so virtuous as to refuse the
highest bidder. The
<a href="https://youtu.be/a8jphxpi1ro" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Keystone Cops</a> now running the FBI and CIA are simply
too stupid to be effectively crooked.

Of course, as is often the case, this issue reveals the yawning divide
between the commoner and the ruling class. The commoner looks at this
and sees it for what it is and is happy the appeals court upheld their
rules. The ruling class, in contrast,
<a href="https://archive.is/HZklR" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">thinks</a> the application of the law is a violation of
the rule of law. In the madhouse world of the managerial class, the
consistent application of the rules is somehow a violation of the rules,
undermining the principle of the law.

It is a good and necessary reminder that the ruling class is well beyond
reform, because they have been afflicted with a strange new religion.
They are angry at the Flynn result on moral grounds, not legal ones. For
them, those laws written on paper are *your* laws and subordinate to
*their* laws, their *moral* laws. In this case, they just see a heretic
and blasphemer escaping punishment. That must be wrong. The managerial
class is becoming the domain of howling lunatics.

Finally, what the Flynn case reveals is the fragility of the elites.
Their constant lashing out at the public is driven by a deep fear that
they sit atop a house of cards. Their lunacy is really just a
manifestation of this constant terror. The managerial elite is a
bourgeois elite; thus, it suffers from bourgeois angst. That angst has
now metastasized into a neurosis masquerading as a moral code. The Great
Panic we are witnessing is another indication that the managerial elite
is in crisis.

That’s why the book <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/White-Fragility-People-About-Racism/dp/0807047414"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">White Fragility</a> is an
instant success with the ruling class. On the surface, the message to
white people is “stop being so insecure and face up to your own racism.”
Below the surface, there lies the fear, “My good, if they ever find out
the truth, we’re all dead.” The endless white-lashing is a defense
mechanism by people who see themselves standing on the trapdoor of the
scaffold. One day, perhaps soon, their fears will be realized and the
trap door will swing open.
