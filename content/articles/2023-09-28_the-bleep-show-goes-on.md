The regime held another audition last night for the role of token
opposition candidate in the presidential election tentatively scheduled
for next year. This time they held the audition at the Reagan library,
which was appropriate given that all of the actors sounded like exhibits
from the 1980’s museum. They even used some clips of Reagan as prompts
so the performers could spit out their favorite lines. It gave the whole
thing the desired retro feel.

Fox News produced the event, as they did the prior event, but this time
they used the B-team to put on the show. In the first event they treated
it like one of the phony talent shows that are a staple of broadcast
television. They had a drone flying around the auditorium and they
introduced the performers like a wrestling show. It was vulgar and
crude, but appropriate given the reality of things. The whole thing is
just another chapter in an ongoing big lie.

Perhaps having been too obvious the first time, they were more subdued
this time, running a standard debate style show. They also used their
B-team actors to play at moderating the thing. They had a chirpy little
blond woman who was disorganized and flustered the entire night. They
had some old guy who must have missed his flight to Heathrow at LAX, so
they made him a moderator. The third wheel was a Spanish woman with a
spray on tan that was starting to peel.

Most of the night was the performers saying the prepared and rehearsed
zingers while everyone else talked over them. It was clear that everyone
was instructed to talk over Ramaswamy so that is what they did, often
just mouthing what appeared to be gibberish, or vamping as they say in
the business. The result was a cacophony of voices while the chirpy
little blond hopped up and down in her seat trying to get the performers
to stop talking over one another.

Why anyone thinks people will sit through this is a mystery. They could
easily solve this problem with the use of shock collars. If a performer
talks over another performer, he gets enough voltage to disable him for
a few minutes. Maybe employ trap doors under their feet as a sort of
timeout. If the performer keeps breaking the rules, the door opens, and
he falls into a garbage pit. He then has to climb the stairs back to the
stage, covered in garbage, and retake his spot.

Of course, the fact that this would be an improvement over what they are
doing is an indictment of the system. If the ruling class treated
elections seriously and they cared about public’s opinion, these vulgar
displays would never happen. The performers, who would be actual
candidates with real agency, would refuse to participate. That is not
our reality, so we get these vulgar displays. If you were trying to
humiliate the voters, you would not do anything different as far as
these shows.

There is some value in watching these things. You get a sense of the
narrative from which the regime is operating. It is clear they still
think Trump gets put in jail, exiled, or bankrupted so he cannot run.
They just had a judge steal his company the other day, so that part of
the script is still operative. That means the midget wrestling shows
they are putting on are for picking the lucky loser of next year’s
election show. One of these losers will get the golden ticket at the
convention.

Last night it was clear they have soured on Noble Black Guy. Tim Scott
got little action and was pushed off to one side. They could be
sidelining him to keep him fresh or they could be moving onto another
actor. Neocon Nikki got the star treatment most of the night and the
regime produced a bunch of
<a href="https://poll.fm/12809644/results" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">fake polls</a> for her. They have been planting <a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/second-republican-debate-nikki-haley-2024-rcna117114"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">stories</a> in regime media claiming that
she is the “insurgent” candidate. Imagine calling the consummate insider
an insurgent.

You have to respect the neocons. They may be evil, but they never
abandon their project, and they always plan ahead. Despite the results
in Ukraine, they still dream the dream of thermonuclear war, so they
keep reaching their tentacles into the process to promote those who
share their dream of extinguishing humanity. Even though they have
publicly abandoned the Republican Party, they see an opening to get one
of their sock puppets the nomination and they are seizing it.

The trouble for them and the regime is that the people are coming to
understand that there are people with the impudence to distort the truth
so infamously as to put forth a shriveled hag like Nikki Haley. She and
her scaly backers are not the solution to the political and cultural
crisis. They are symbols of it. Only in a morally bankrupt system can
degenerates like this flourish. If a meteor struck the Reagan Library
last night during the show, the world would be a better place.

Sadly, it will not come to that just yet. Instead, it was merely another
reminder to Republican voters that their party hates them. All of the
actors were handed lines to say mean things about Trump, who is now the
face of the party’s voters. The only thing they did not do is take turns
spitting on a picture of Trump. The star of this portion was a fat slob
they trucked in to repeat Borsht Belt zingers about Trump. The
<a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/chris-christies-night/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">usual suspects</a> still think this stuff
is hilarious, which is a topic all its own.

In the end politics is always about the desires of the ruling class. No
matter what the people think, the people in charge want what they want.
They will never be talked out of being the ruling class. On the other
hand, if what they want makes it impossible for society to operate, then
we get a new ruling class. At this point, all of the trust is gone so
they have to keep Netflix running, sportball playing and the grillers
grilling, so no one notices the cracks spreading all around us.
