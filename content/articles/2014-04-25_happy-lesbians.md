Today I stopped for a sandwich at the local bagel shop. It is a treat I
have maybe once or twice a month. Usually there’s a pretty little blond
at the counter, but she was hustling tables this morning. A new girl was
handling takeout. I’m assuming she is a lesbian due to the lip ring,
boys jeans, plain hair and sports bra. For whatever reason, lesbians
like to try and hide their boobs. I’m sure there is more nuance to
lesbian dress codes, but as a non-lesbian, I only notice the basics. The
other thing that seems standard with lesbians is the sour look. They
always look sad.

Are there happy lesbians? I’m reminded of
<a href="http://www.isteve.com/golf_lesbians_nabisco.htm"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this classic</a> from Steve
Sailer. Re-reading it, I get the sense unhappiness is woven throughout
the lesbian lifestyle. It is, after all, a narrow subculture that has
never enjoyed the popularity with elite culture  that we see with male
homosexuality. The typical lesbian is ignored by popular culture. I
would imagine that makes the sub-culture of lesbianism more difficult.
<a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The overall exclusivity</a> of
the group probably explains some of the surliness as well as the strict
dress code.

When roughly 1-in-100 are a potential sex-partner, life can be quite
lonely.

I also wonder if the biology is more the issue than social pressure.
Homosexuals have much higher drug and alcohol abuse. They have very high
suicide rates. Violence between homosexuals is also much higher than
between heteros. Lesbians, according to crime figures, are twice as
likely to be a victim of domestic violence as hetero women. That’s a
staggering number. When you look at <a
href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/01/gay-marriage-same-but-different/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">divorce rates</a>, it’s rather
clear that homosexuals should not bother with marriage. Their rates of
divorce are astronomical. Lesbians are the least likely to remain
“married.” All of this points to a population of uncommonly miserable
people.
