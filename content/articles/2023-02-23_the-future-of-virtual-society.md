At the dawn of the internet revolution, it was common for big-brained
public intellectuals to talk about what it meant for the nature of
society. As is always the case, they confused what they wanted to happen
with what would happen. That usually meant some form of “as information
is democratized, more people will have access to information and
therefore come to agree with me on everything.” The internet would bring
about the glorious egalitarian future.

Most of the predictions about the impact of the internet turned out to
be wrong, but the internet has changed society. In fact, it has changed
people by changing the selection pressures within society. For example,
the phenomenon of the
<a href="https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=19531" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">digital grifter</a> is something that could not exist in
the past. These people certainly existed in some form, but the digital
age rewards their behavior, while the analog age did not, so they now
flourish, while in the past they were suppressed.

That is how to think about it. Virtual reality is not reality. Life
on-line exaggerates certain features by removing constraints or offering
incentives. The solitary nature of on-line life removes the social
signals that people rely upon to figure out what they can say and what
they should not say. When you are on-line, you are by yourself in the
physical realm, even though you are interacting with others in the
virtual realm. Those people, however, are mere avatars of people.

Of course, things that get the user attention are rewarded with likes,
clicks and views, so this encourages more of that behavior. It does not
take long before the weak minded are consumed with attention seeking.
Twitter is full of hollow people who amplify the current thing as a way
to get attention. In the hours after every cable news actor was sporting
a Ukraine pin and chanting “keev”, the internet personality was pulling
down her Covid stuff and putting up Ukraine stuff.

Years ago, Dave Chappell did a skit where the internet was a real place.
What made the skit amusing, in addition to Chappelle’s delivery, was the
fact that the internet is such an absurd place compared to reality.
Imagine walking through a store and everyone in the store is doing
whatever they can to get your attention. Imagine the day after the war
started, everything at the store is in Ukraine colors and all of the
employees are chanting “keev” at the top of their lungs.

Another novelty that the digital age has brought is the clout chaser.
This is a person who spends his days scanning the internet looking for
the next thing so he can seem like the first person to get on it. These
people front-run trends in order to present themselves as trendsetters.
They will often glom onto a person, positively or negatively,  who has a
big following on-line. This lets them free-ride off that person to gain
attention and followers for themselves.

This is not something that could exist in the analog age. Famous people
had flunkies, but the flunky was never going to use their association
with the famous person to make himself famous independent of the famous
person. Mike Cernovich could never have become a thing in the analog age
by stalking famous people. On Twitter he was able to build a huge
following mostly by front running trends he had no role in creating and
glomming onto big Twitter accounts.

Another version of this is the manufactured influencer. If you watch
YouTube, you will have noticed that Lex Fridman was always in your
suggestions. You could only watch woodworking videos, but YouTube would
suggest to you a Fridman video. The reason is the people backing him
paid YouTube to do it. A similar thing is now happening with Jordan
Peterson, who signed up with the Ben Shapiro operation. They are now
paying to have Peterson promoted on YouTube.

They did the same thing with Ben Shapiro. The people behind the Daily
Wire made a Mortimer and Randolph Duke type of bet to see if they could
make this obscure hobbit man into a star. How they did it was social
media. They paid to have Ben Shapiro pushed heavy to middle-class whites
on Facebook. He was what they hoped young people were really thinking.
It worked. This helium voiced nobody is now a household name and a major
influencer of old white conservatives.

Tim Pool is another version of this phenomenon. Spend some time watching
his YouTube channel and ask yourself why he has a huge audience. There
are hundreds of people doing some version of the same act. The answer is
he has the backing of an influencer production company. Richard Hanania
is the most recent example of the manufactured influencer. The guy
suddenly appears on-line and before long all the other influencers are
mentioning him.

This deranging of the public culture to now has mostly been about
rewarding qualities and people that existed but were suppressed in the
analog age. What we see with the Zoomers is a whole generation of people
raised in this culture. This
<a href="https://archive.is/uz4ID" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">post</a> in the New York Times, of all places, is a good
read on the subject. Those born around the turn of the century are the
first generation raised on the internet. This is their normal as they
never knew a world without the internet.

One result of this cohort being raised on-line is they lack the normal
social skills that have defined human life for ten thousand years.
People have noted that in real life, this cohort is shy, awkward and
quite weird. On the other hand, they are the exact opposite as their
on-line persona. Meet Nick Fuentes and you are not all that impressed as
his social skills are non-existent. Turn on a mic or pull out a camera
and he goes from shrinking violet to boisterous and confident.

This is why this generation was not upset by the lockdowns. They did not
complain about Zoom school because that was better than having to be
around those talking meat sacks on campus. They prefer life on-line to
life outside. They have grown up with the chat room as their playground.
Instead of playing games with their friends in the physical realm, they
played games on-line. Their peer group was the collection of avatars and
personalities in the chat.

Everyone has their opinion on this stuff, but the important question
that no one seems to be considering is if society is possible under
these conditions. China’s heavy-handed censorship is viewed as a defense
of the regime, but it could simply be a way to tamp down the negative
selection pressures of the internet. American censorship is driven
mostly by ethnic paranoia, which is another negative quality that is
being amplified by the forces of the digital age.

It could very well be that the newly diverse Western societies cannot
hold up under the selection pressure of the internet. The digital age
amplifies the differences, which amplifies the natural reaction to those
differences. This has the effect of bringing diverse civilizational
outlooks into virtue contact. The result is hostility. The West may be
forced to choose between the glories of diversity or the virtual public
square. The answer may be a segregated internet in order to keep the
peace.
