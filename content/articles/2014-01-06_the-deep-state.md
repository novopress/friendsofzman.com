I’m not a big believer in the alleged “deep state” that runs the
country. I do think the rich and powerful exercise a great deal of
influence over government. In fact, it is reasonable to say that the
rich run the country and the political class is mostly their
servants. That seems obvious. Rich guys parade in and out of the White
House every day. The fact that these folks have a commonality of
interests also seems obvious. Look at the push by rich people to flood
the nation with peasants. Open borders favors the rich.

There’s a long way from that reality to the idea of a deep state, but
when you see <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stories like this</a> you have
to wonder. Then only reason any of this is out in the public is the
Snowden affair. Big bureaucracies like the NSA start making comical
blunders like this when they reach a certain size. Still, it suggests
the permanent ruling class is not the life-serving Congressmen and
Senators, but the life-serving hacks in the bureaucracy.

The life-servers in the intelligence blob are the kings of the hill
because they hold everyone’s secrets. It is not a big leap from that to
thinking the rich guys telling Congress what to do also are pulling the
strings at the NSA. On the other hand, maybe the security services have
enough dirt on the rich to control them as well. Maybe it is just a
weird balance of interests that keeps the whole thing running. The one
thing that unifies all parties is making sure the public never gets what
they want from government.
