The sporting press and liberal America is in mourning today. <a

was cut by the Rams</a>.

*Michael Sam, who is seeking to become the NFL’s first openly gay
player, was passed over by 31 teams Sunday just one day after being cut
by St. Louis, USA Today reported.*

*The rookie defensive end cleared waivers and is now free to try and
sign with the Rams’ practice squad.*

*Sam was cut by St. Louis on Saturday as the Rams tried to get their
roster down to 53 players for the first game of the season.*

*Sam thanked the Rams on Saturday for the opportunity and said he would
continue to try and land a position on an NFL team.*

It was a bad move by his agent to turn Michael Sam into a gay action
hero. The NFL is a heartless racket where tiny differences in talent can
make the difference between success and failure. Coaches are paranoid
control freaks because of it. Anything that distracts from their focus
and the team’s focus on the tasks at hand is rooted out of the
organization. They have no choice. Otherwise they get fired. Jeff
Fischer knows the pressure was on to make a spot for Sam, but he has to
win and Sam is an extra he does not need. End of story.

On the other hand, no team will roll the dice on a marginal rookie
because the crazies in the press will not stop yapping about the gay
stuff. High draft picks get a longer leash than late picks, but there’s
not a lot of patience with any of the rookies. Once a guy proves he can
help you win, then it swings the other way. The NFL will tolerate a
child molester who can help a team win. Right now, Sam is not a guy that
can help a team win so the media circus following him around is a major
liability.
