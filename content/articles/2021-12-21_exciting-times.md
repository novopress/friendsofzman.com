**Note:** This coming Thursday I will be on with the great Ed Dutton to
explain to him that intelligence is a social construct used to defend
white supremacy. The livestream is on the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DrEdwardDuttonTheJollyHeretic"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube</a> at 2PM eastern. He posts
replay on
<a href="https://www.bitchute.com/channel/1MUVaTZWgbLj/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Bitchute</a> so when that link is available, it will be
posted here.

One of the signs that you are living in an unpredictable age is that
each year the world seems less predictable and reliable. When people
say, “It is an exciting time” they generally mean it is an unpredictable
time. Of course, when an enemy says, “May you live in exciting times”
they are wishing you end up in an unpredictable age. The reason
unpredictable is seen as a curse is it means uncertainty. When you
cannot count on anything, you live in a world populated with risk.

Three years ago, no one in their right mind would have predicted that
Joe Biden would be president or even alive. He was a frail old man. Two
years ago, that was being confirmed as he staggered from one loss to the
next in the primary. Then all of a sudden, the rest of the field retired
and he was made the nominee. A year ago, his unlikely and unprecedented
victory put a frail old man in the White House. Few people thought Biden
would be alive, much less still president today.

That is what makes the coming year interesting. The ruling regime,
mostly by their own hand, now live in interesting times. They have the
midterms looming, which is always a rough time for the regime as fraud
is at its lowest. They can get their believers agitated enough to “do
what it takes” in presidential elections because they can personalize it
for them, as we saw in 2020 and 2000. People forget that the 2000
election was the most fraud-ridden election up to that point.

On top of the normal problems they face; they have a president who is so
out of his mind that mocking him seems cruel. A big part of his low
approval numbers is an anger at the regime for installing a vegetable in
the White House. That is compounded by the fact that his second is about
as popular as rectal cancer. Fans cannot call for the backup president
because she is worse than a vegetable. The whole thing is a train wreck
with no obvious solution.

It is a good reminder that the people running the empire are no
geniuses. They are clever, but not smart. Clever people know how to
wiggle out of tight jams, but smart people know how to avoid the jams.
Bill Clinton was clever because he could always slip the noose, but
never smart enough to avoid the trap entirely. The people running the
empire were able to outflank the hapless Donald Trump, but they just
created another mess for themselves in the process.

Now, they have a president that will have to be replaced before the 2024
election simply due to his declining health. No one wants strong diverse
female in the top job as it turns out she is dumber than her critics had
claimed. If they are going to engineer a coup against her, it has to be
done in 2022. Otherwise, they could face the prospect of getting a VP
through a Republican House and Senate. Granted, the GOP will roll over
and play dead, but it would still be ugly.

Of course, removing Harris from office and finding a suitable
replacement would end up being like one of those airport brawls. The
Harris staff would leave only after a World Star quality melee posted on
Twitter. Even if that could be averted, who would they find to replace
her as VP? The Left does not have the “take one for the team” mentality
when it comes to this stuff. The only plausible option is Hillary
Clinton, who would take the job on the condition that Biden dies in
2023.

That is just one enormous headache for the regime. Their loons are
gearing up for what may be the most ridiculous show trial in history.
The crackpots on the January 6th commission plan to entertain us
starting in January. Imagine the increasingly deranged Liz Cheney and
the bug-eyed Adam Schiff, stripped naked and sent running through a
field full of garden rakes. That image is somber compared to what lies
ahead for this ridiculous show trial they have planned.

It has been forgotten that this same crew managed to turn the second
impeachment show into a laugh riot. In that farce, the witnesses were
Jewish people with names that sounded like the roster of a Russian
hockey team, but the they were mostly boring and incomprehensible. In
this farce, the witnesses will be people expert at getting attention on
social media. It is going to look like Reddit exploded and the bits
landed at the witness table of this hearing. It is going to be bizarre.

We are just scratching the surface when it comes to the many dangers for
the regime that lie just over the horizon. The economy is doing things
all the smart people claimed was impossible and it is getting worse. The
Covid panic has turned into something of a UFO cult that is beyond the
ability of the rulers to control. This is just the stuff we know about
right now. The future is never bright for a gerontocracy, but 2023 is
looking to be exciting times for our geezer overlords.

The American empire is now firmly in its
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Crisis of the Third Century</a> phase.
This is when powerful actors see advantage in chaos. The regime itself
sees chaos as a way to prevent the mobs from forming at the gates. The
thought of normalcy is what keeps them up at night, so they embrace the
chaos. Chaos cannot go on forever, so the exciting times will reach an
end at some point. That point is always just beyond where people think
it should lie, so 2023 promises to be an exciting time.
