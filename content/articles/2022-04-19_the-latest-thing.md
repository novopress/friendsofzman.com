Yesterday a federal judge struck down the CDC mandate requiring
passengers to wear ceremonial face coverings on public transport. For
the last two years airplane passengers have been required to wear masks
at the airport and on the plane, unless they were eating or drinking. Of
course, this has allowed the petty dictators to harass people while
traveling. The mask-marms have been looking for reasons to fly just so
they could harass people. Now that is over.

The CDC appears to have conceded the point and will not appeal. They
tried to front run the news by announcing the mandate has ended. The
media has made sure to put the name and picture of the judge on all of
their attack channels probably hoping that one of their lunatics goes
bonkers over it. The public reaction has been celebratory, based on what
has been posted on-line. Normal people are sick of the ridiculous
charade over Covid and just want to be done with it.

To the dismay of the Covidians, the public is ready to close the books
on the whole thing and just forget about it. Most normal people are a
bit angry at having gone along with this lunacy. There is certainly some
shame involved. This is to be expected as everyone feels shame after
having been taken for a fool and not having said anything against this
stuff. That is why this will be memory-holed by the summer, so people
can just move on.

It is a little hint as to why the sociopaths in the media keep getting
away with these mass hoaxes that have become a feature of life. People
wake up and see that everyone is now into the latest thing. Maybe that
thing is outrage over a police shooting or maybe it is some new abstract
concern. All of the right people are on their soapboxes and all of the
best people are following along with them. It is only normal for people
to want to do the right thing and support the latest thing.

Of course, the latest thing always turns out to be the latest fraud.
Some go longer than others, depending upon the agenda. The crusade
against Islam launched by Republicans and cheered by conservatives ran
for a long time. It is not easy building out a police state so they
needed that fraud to run for years. Covid was part of the color
revolution launched against Trump and quickly became a convenient tool
of control by the petty tyrants that terrorize daily life.

The facts are becoming clear at this point. The lockdowns had no impact
on the course of the virus or its impact on the public. There was never
any data to support the policies and now we know it caused more harm
than good. Similarly, idiotic things like social distancing and mask
wearing were useless. In the fullness of time, we will learn that the
vaccine was a massive boondoggle. It was just a money transfer to Big
Pharma and the health care rackets.

There is another angle here. The courts have struck down almost all of
the Covid polices by now. The ceremonial mask wearing on planes was the
last big item to be cancelled by the courts. All of these could have
been knocked down by the courts when they were enacted, but it took two
years for judges to remember that we have this thing called the law. It
is a reminder that the courts are just another ruling class institution
run by the maniacs of the new religion.

Notice that even dissidents struggle to remember the Bush years. That
was a fraud on the public of epic proportions. Millions of people voted
for it and supported it, but now they have stashed it in the shadows of
their mind. The reason is none of us want to be reminded of our
blunders. Failure, no matter how instructive, brings a sense of shame so
we put our failures out of minds. Just as the Bush years have faded from
our minds the Covid fiasco will soon fade too.

This is how these frauds keep working. It is the Gell-Man amnesia effect
scaled up to the whole of society. This is the phenomenon where you read
something in the media and see it is total nonsense. You know the
subject of the article and you quickly see that the article is full of
falsehoods and mistakes. You then go to the next article about which you
know little and accept what is presented. You completely forget that the
previous article was all nonsense.

This is what is happening in America. People see the latest thing
trending on Twitter and start learning about it through the media. When
they see the latest thing is a fraud, they get mad about it. Then they
see the next thing trending and forget all about the fraud of the
previous thing. The Covid fraud is now the previous thing while Ukraine
is now the latest thing. People are accepting the latest thing from the
same people they know sold them the previous thing.

This pattern works as long as the vast bulk of people are supplied with
plenty of food, safety and entertainments. You may not be able to lift
your arm due to a reaction to the vaccine your employer mandated, but
you do not want to be that guy who goes against the grain. After all,
you look around and see that everyone is enjoying the current thing. As
long as everyone is excited for the next thing, why be that guy who
mentioned what happened with the previous thing?

The lesson of Covid is that reason is of no use on the public. Abductive
reasoning will always triumph over deductive and inductive reasoning.
The only thing that can break this cycle of madness is when the latest
thing is a bad thing that cannot be jawboned away by the media. At that
point, their efforts to sell a new distraction turns around on them and
becomes a liability. When the current thing is real suffering, people
will remember all the previous things were lies.
