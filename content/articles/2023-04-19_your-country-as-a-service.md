In the money game, it is said that if you need hard money to control
your ruling class, your ruling class will find a way around the limits
of hard money. This is observationally true as every government in the
history of man has found some way to corrupt their currency for short
term advantage. For most of human history this has meant debasing the
currency with cheap metal. In modern times, it means installing
humanity’s worst schemers with the task of manipulating the currency.

That expression about money is a pithy way of pointing out that words on
a piece of paper are never a restraint on the corrupt. The reason is the
written law is just the formal expression of the unwritten law. Those
words on the paper represent the spirit that organizes and limits the
ruling class. If the people in the ruling class no longer abide by the
spirit of the law, they will find a way around the letter of the law.
This is something we can see plainly with the basics in America.

If you were to ask Americans to name the most fundamental freedom in the
Constitution, they would surely say free speech. Some would point to
other things, for sure, but the consensus would be speech. It is the
thing America is most known for around the world. Europeans will often
point to our first amendment right to speak our mind in public as the
most important American right. It is the thing the world most identifies
with being an American.

Despite that, the right to speak your mind is going away quickly. The
most outrageous example is the recent trial of Douglas Mackey. He was
arrested immediately after Biden was installed for the crime of mocking
Clinton voters in 2016. Mackey operated the Ricky Vaughn account on
Twitter, which was notorious for mocking the Left, especially the
zombies who lined up to support Hillary Clinton. While obviously a
satire account, it was comedy gold in the meme wars.

The government claimed that his jokes about the stupidity of Clinton
voters denied these stupid Clinton voters the right to be stupid Clinton
voters. That is not an exaggeration or a misrepresentation. The
government offered no one who was denied their right to vote but managed
to convince a judge and jury that these jokes tricked stupid Clinton
voters out of their right to vote. The verdict is on appeal, but Mackey
now faces ten years in prison.

Everyone involved in this case, except for Mackey, of course, made clear
that they have no respect for the basic right of speech. The government
found creative ways around the words on the page to charge Mackey. The
judge found creative ways to rig the case in favor of the state. He then
threatened the jury with lifetime sequestration when they were
deadlocked. The jury then found a way to convict a fellow citizen of
speaking mean words to rich people.

The thing about the Mackey case is not that it is rare, but that it is
just a causal and blatant example of a pattern.
<a href="https://archive.is/ZYbN5" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Here</a> is a new case where the Feds are charging
people with holding the wrong opinions about Russia. They claim that
these people were involved with Russian agents and spreading bad words
to blacks. Most people would assume you have a right to spread bad
words, even if they are about blacks and they come from a Russian
citizen. It says so on the paper.

The recent Fox News settlement is another example of how thoroughly
corrupt the courts are now. Fox was accused of doing fake news, a thing
so common that the words no longer have meaning. The judge was
determined to make sure they were punished, so Fox had no choice but to
write a big check. Meanwhile, the New York Times manufactures fake news
and deliberately defames people but enjoys blanket immunity from the
court system.

Of course, the place where most speech occurs in the modern age is on
the internet and the rulers are moving to close off that avenue. The
Restrict Act is described as “a systematic framework for addressing
technology-based threats to the security and safety of Americans.” The
stated purpose is to let the government shut off services like TikTok,
but in reality, it will let the party shutter any site they wish. It is
the modern version of The Sedition Act of 1918.

There are two main differences between the assault on speech today
versus the assault on speech a century ago. The most obvious is that The
Sedition Act of 1918 was specifically aimed at anti-war speech. Today,
the reason for stripping the rights of the citizens is personal and
petty. The people in charge do not like being mocked by the peasants on
the internet. The assault on your basic rights is part of a war waged
from the top against the white middle-class.

The other main difference is that there was a clear limit on how long
these limits on speech would last. This was a wartime act, and everyone
agreed it was an exception to the general rule of open debate. In other
words, the people who crafted the bill did so knowing the general rule
was the default, but that in the extraordinary circumstances of the war,
they were making an exception. Today, it is the reverse. The new default
is you need permission to speak in public.

Looking back, this change in the spirit of the law, at least with
respect to the ruling class, should have been obvious. The concept of
the terms of service has proliferated with the spread of technology,
despite running counter to Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence. The contract of
adhesion has always been a carefully regulated exception to contract
law, but now it is the default. Everything you do is becoming subject to
a terms of service agreement imposed on you by the powerful.

It is why appeals to the letter of the law mean nothing now. The people
who view the letter of the law through the lens of the terms of service,
naturally look at the Constitution the same way. As the issuing party,
they get to interpret the words on the paper however they wish. Every
judge is now operating like a content moderator at a social media
platform. You are free to choose another country provider, but as long
as you are in this one, they control your content.

The only difference is that YouTube sends you an e-mail whenever they
willy-nilly change their terms of service. In a Country As A Service,
you learn about the new rules as they are booking you for violating the
new rules. Those weird e-mails have been replaced by the sound of the
jail door slamming on some poor victim of the new rules against hate
speech or mean content. You can guess what “your account has been
suspended” will soon mean.
