**Note:** My Taki
<a href="https://www.takimag.com/article/revolution-time/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> is on the same topic as today’s
post. Sunday Thoughts is on a short break for the holiday, but I did
post <a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/posts/643560" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">this</a> about our spoiled rulers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the longest time, Americans were told that class did not exist
because in America anyone could grow up to be president. While
theoretically true, everyone understood that this was never to be taken
literally. It simply meant that if you worked hard and made the right
choices, you could maximize your potential. A person born poor could
become rich is they had the talent for it.

This has been true, at least as far as economics. Many of our rich
people started out as modest men. Through good fortune and tenacity,
they made billions. Even today you can go far if you know how to work
the system. Ibram X. Kendi has made himself very rich working the race
hustle. Robin DiAngelo got rich in the same hustle. Even these sorts of
mediocrities found riches by working the right angles.

This economic egalitarianism has fooled people into thinking the same
rules apply to the management of society. America is a democracy where
the people pick their leaders and guide public policy. The fact this is
not true and never had been true is something with which Americans have
always struggled, but good times made it is easy to conceal, because the
system seemed to be working.

Things have not been working for a couple of years now. In fact, the
sense that things are going wrong has probably been with us since the
Bush years. While the economic numbers given to us by the government
painted a rosy picture, people were starting to question things when the
Iraq War went bad. The sense that things were heading in the wrong
direction grew during the Obama years.

The election of Donald Trump was confirmation that a significant share
of the voting public was worried about the direction of things. He was a
blow against the Deep State that was secretly rigging things in favor of
certain elites. The response from Washington seemed to confirm that
shadowy actors are putting their thumbs on the scale, eighty million of
them perhaps, to alter outcomes in their favor.

The concept of the Deep State is another form of escapism. Instead of
questioning the system itself, blame goes to invisible players who
corrupt the system. Even the most unhappy people want to believe the
system can work. Those shadowy players use this to pit one group of
Americans against another. “It is the Left!” for some, “It is white
supremacy” for others.

A <a
href="https://uchicagopolitics.opalstacked.com/uploads/homepage/Polarization-Poll.pdf"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent poll</a> claimed that most people
think the government is completely corrupt and barely half trust
election results. On the other hand, the overwhelming majority of
Americans say they are <a
href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/394202/record-low-extremely-proud-american.aspx"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">proud</a> to be an American. In fact,
well over half say they are very or extremely proud. The fact that the
poll headline suggests the opposite of the results could explain the
apparent conflict in these polls.

People are starting to figure out that they are ruled by aliens and they
have no peaceful way to alter this reality. The two parties are just two
sock puppets operated by the people who are in charge. In the fall, one
sock puppet will “win” the election, but they will just do all the same
things the other party was doing. It will be done in the name of
bipartisanship, which is when you are supposed to clap.

This is where that gap between the two polls creates trouble. The
various campaigns waged by the ruling class over the last few years were
intended to destroy pride in being an American, especially among a
certain group. Instead, it has evolved a sense that the people in charge
are alien and hostile. They have corrupted the people’s system for their
benefit at the expense of the people.

In other words, the managerial elite wanted people to become more docile
and dependent on the people running things. In order for that to happen
the people needed to lose trust in themselves as “Americans”, whatever
that means, and increase their trust in the experts running the system.
What those two polls suggest is the exact opposite of what the
managerial elite needs to happen.

Things will get interesting in the coming months as inflation, recession
and supply chain problems eat into the economic wellbeing of the public.
Again, people can and will tolerate just about anything if they have a
good economy. Juvenal mocked this about the Romans and many do the same
about Americans, but this practicality is the thing that makes civilized
life possible.

People get political when forced into it. Bad times force people to look
around and update their judgement about society. Those drag queen story
hours piss off politically inclined people in good times. In bad times,
they infuriate everyone else. In good times, a president who struggles
to remember his own name and soils himself in public makes for some good
jokes. In bad times it stops being funny.

None of this is to suggest that there is a revolution brewing. Right
now, inflation is tolerable and gas prices are worrisome for most
people. Revolution is a process that starts with a tiny minority
realizing that the system is beyond reform. If they are right, this
awareness slowly grows among the politically inclined, changing their
rhetoric and how they engage with the public at large.

This is what happened when the colonies revolted 250 years ago. A sense
of separation between the rulers and the people crept in like the fog.
Some people never lost their connection to the king. Others lost it at
the first sign of trouble. Most were in the middle somewhere, eventually
coming around to the fact that they no longer had a natural bond to the
people who claimed to rule over them.

The first rebellion in the colonies was close to a century before the
big rebellion that led to independence. In 1676, Nathaniel Bacon led an
army of 1,000 Virginia colonists against the governor William Berkeley.
They suspected the governor was in league with the Indian tribes, which
made him reluctant to go after the tribes that were massacring settlers
on the frontier. That should sound familiar.

The fact is, there were many revolts, rebellions and insurrections prior
to the war for independence, all of which stemmed from the same problem.
The people in charge were not safeguarding the interests of the people.
Often, they ignored their duty for personal gain. In time, the general
population was in revolt spiritually, if not physically taking up arms.
The result was inevitable.

This is where we are in America. Every day, more people have that
revolution in the mind where they realize that it is the system that
created these loathsome creatures who inhabit positions of authority.
The system was not captured by them. The solution is to throw the whole
thing into the ocean and start fresh. Perhaps in time January 6th will
be Culpepper’s Rebellion or the War of the Regulation.

The American revolution was not a singular event. It was the culmination
of a process that began generations earlier. The same is true of all
revolutions. The events that made this day possible happened over a long
period of time. Present day America is somewhere on the timeline, maybe
closer to the end than most realize, but still not quite at the
revolting stage. Time will tell.
