I read a study once that claimed that people who enjoyed the suffering
of their enemies were healthier and happier. Things like schadenfreude
and revenge fantasies are not only normal, but part of a healthy
lifestyle. Seeing bad people suffer, even slightly, reinforces our sense
of justice, which in turns gives us confidence that the world does
operate by a fixed set of rules. The suffering of the wicked confirms
those <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ordinary modes of thought</a>
John Derbyshire described.

Fishing around for material this week, I stumbled upon some stories that
brought a smile, because they featured the unhappiness of bad people.
Naturally, I thought a whole show on the suffering of the wicked was a
good idea. It is easy to succumb to self-pity and despair, so it is
important to look at the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJUhlRoBL8M"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bright side of life</a> on
occasion in order to avoid those temptations. Given what faces us this
fall, there will be plenty of time for weeping and gnashing of teeth.

It’s also important to keep in mind that the people in charge are
terribly unhappy with the state of things, which is why they are
revolting. These punitive measures they are inflicting upon us are not
coming from a supreme sense of self confidence, but from a deep fear
that revolution is brewing in the shadows. The reason they are running
around looking for bad-thinkers is they lie awake at night imagining one
us creeping from the darkness with a My Pillow as they sleep.

There’s also the fact that these people are not gods. They slithered in
through the gaps in the doors then flung open the gates to allow their
co-conspirators in to take over the institutions, but they are not
worthy of their positions. They are riding high only because we let
them. Looking at their failings and weaknesses is a good way to remind
ourselves that this lunacy stops when we make it stop. Numbers still
matter. The night of the million pillows is probably closer than we
think.

That’s something to keep in mind as the fall election kicks off in the
coming weeks and the usual suspects are trying to peddle a bitter bindy
and a dementia patient as the solution to what ails them. This really is
the best they got. What comes next for them is the <a

Tucker pointed out the other day, we really do need to enjoy the show.
This is lunacy at a scale and intensity not seen since Caligula was the
ruler of the civilized world.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stitcher</a> for the weirdos.
YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
below.

year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.

that you can’t live on clicks and compliments.
