week I was feeling a bit salty. I think it is due to feeling the need to
watch the news about the Vegas shooting. My Lord, our mass media is
terrible. When I am ruler of these lands, once per month we will
celebrate my reign by hurling a randomly selected media person into the
void. Perhaps for variety, I’ll have some fed to wild beasts.

Anyway, this week I have the usual variety of items, but I’m not my
easy-going self so be prepared for a little bit of edge at points. This
week I have a bonus track on Gab. I’m going to use that platform for my
edgy stuff, I think. It seems like a good place for it. If you are not
on Gab, you should be, despite their flaws. They are the good guys
fighting to keep the lamps from going out in the West.

For this week, Spreaker has the full show. YouTube has the four longer
segments from the show It appears they are not censoring me yet. Last
week was some sort of mysterious technical issue.  I am now on iTunes,
which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler phones.
