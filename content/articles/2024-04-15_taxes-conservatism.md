Today is Tax Day in America, a day when millions of Americans drop
tear-soaked checks into the mail, along with their many tax forms. Of
course, for most Americans it is now just another day. Their taxes are
simple, and their tax is paid by their employer throughout the year. The
resulting decline of Tax Day and the tax issue is a good entry point for
examining how our politics have changed over the last decade and a good
place to start when thinking about the death of conservatism.

Half a century ago, the run-up to Tax Day was a big party for the people
we call conservatives, as it gave them an excuse to go out into the
streets, banging their pots and pans about the unfairness of the tax
code. Taxes were not only too high, but they were also far too
complicated. Rarely said, but often implied, was the claim that a
complex tax code allowed special interests to game the system and avoid
taxes or bribe their favorite politicians to get special tax breaks.

You never hear this sort of talk now. Taxes were the bread-and-butter
issue of so-called conservatives since Barry Goldwater, but no more. One
reason for that is tax simplification was passed under Trump. For most
Americans taxes are a few clicks on the computer and that is it.
Business owners, rich people and the self-employed still have to go
through the game of guessing what the IRS says they owe, but the typical
suburban peasant is now free of this burden.

Interestingly, a central theme of so-called conservatives in the 1970’s
and 1980’s regarding taxes was that if people knew how much they really
paid in taxes they would revolt against the welfare state. There were
schemes back then to make taxes a quarterly affair, so everyone was
always be aware of their tax burden. Instead, they went the other way
and made taxes simpler, so that their voters no longer cared about the
main issue for the so-called conservatives.

Of course, the main reason so-called conservatives have forgotten about
the tax issue is they have done with it what they have done with so many
other issues and that is embraced the position of the people they
oppose. The fiscal conservative is like a guy wearing a denim leisure
suit in Washington. It is so rare to hear anyone talk about the nation’s
finances that when it happens it brings back memories of those halcyon
days when the Gipper was shaking his fist at the Soviets.

This raises another truth about so-called conservatism. They were sure
that if you starved the system of taxes, it would have to cut spending.
Despite history saying otherwise, they were certain of it. Instead, they
habituated their minds to ever growing deficits and an incomprehensible
national debt. Per capita debt is about five times higher than under
Reagan and about four times higher as a percentage of the GDP, so it is
safe to say they were all wrong about this one.

There is a demographic aspect to this as well. When the baby boomers
were in their prime working years, it was good politics to promise them
lower taxes and greater returns from their investments. Now that they
are retiring in droves, the tax ploy no longer works, so no one
discusses it. Instead, it is good politics to create more money from
thin air to pay for the entitlement programs. Like everything else about
conservatism, taxes were nothing but a good marketing ploy.

This raises another tax-related issue. Tax collections are at record
highs, but the deficit is also at all-time highs. The federal deficit in
2023 was $1.7 trillion. The rosiest of rosy scenarios says that federal
budget deficits be $20 trillion over the next decade and federal debt
held by the public will reach 116 percent of GDP. Given that these
projections always turn out wrong, it is not hard to see why no one in
Washington is talking about taxes or the state of the budget.

This is why so-called conservatism is headed to the dustbin of history.
It was never really a conservative political movement, but more of a
money laundering scheme masquerading as a political movement. The
response to progressives promising to rob your neighbor and let you have
a piece was so-called conservatives promising to rob the progressive and
let you have a piece. Taken together we got a half century of systemic
looting of their American economy.

For the last half century, the white middle-class has been the kid
getting bullied at school for his lunch money. Progressives,
representing the financial elites, threatened to shove the suburban
peasant into a locker. So-called conservatives kept upping the lunch
money they had to pay to avoid the wedgie. Now those suburban peasants
are too old for school, so those financial elites are looking to prey on
their children and grandchildren to keep the plates spinning.

Another legacy of the so-called conservatives with regards to tax policy
is the sacralization of rich people. Part of their sales pitch for tax
changes was the claim that our noble rich people were paying more than
their fair share in taxes. This was always nonsense, but it convinced
most white people that it is immoral to question the motives and
behavior of the rich. One result is a perfidious and destructive ruling
class that seems hellbent on pulling the roof down on all of us.

In the end, the disappearance of the tax issue from public debate is a
good reminder that we are at the end of a long cycle. That means we are
about to start on a new political cycle, so the past framing of things
is of no use to us. The old ideas and arguments from the last century,
things like tax fairness, need to be sent to the dustbin of history
along with the people who championed them. In some future Tax Day, no
one will have a reason to think of so-called conservatism.
