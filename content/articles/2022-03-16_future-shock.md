Way back in the last century, futurism was a thing that serious people
followed because America was still an optimistic country. The 1970’s
promised to end that but the revival in the 1980’s brought it back in
vogue. The microprocessor revolution was mostly responsible, but the
subsequent end to the Cold War also helped. One of the chief gurus of
futurism in the last three decades of the 20th century was a man named
Alvin Toffler, who wrote a number of bestselling books.

Alvin Toffler has mostly been forgotten now, but he was a big deal from
the 1970’s into the new century. His two big books were Future Shock and
Third Wave, in which he described how the world was changing due to a
number of forces, one of which was the technological revolution that was
in its infancy at the time. Toffler wound up consulting with global
leaders like Chinese premiere Zhao Ziyang, Michael Gorbachev, Newt
Gingrich and various corporate leaders.

Toffler was credited with an idea that the next phase of civilization
would be characterized by the pace of change. That is, the people would
not only have to adapt to a changing society, but also adapt to a
society that was under constant change at a rate that may exceed our
ability to keep pace. Technology would advance so quickly that we would
not have time to create new habits for the new rules. Instead, we would
become corks on a raging river of change.

One of the keys to futurism is to never get too specific about the
future, especially the future you expect to see. That way, no one can
compare your prediction with what actually happened. Toffler was careful
to not get too specific as to what life would be like in a world where
the rules changed too quickly for people to adapt. Instead, he imagined
a world where some people would be better at coping with constant change
and others would struggle, thus creating a new status system.

To some degree this has proven to be true. You see this in the work
place where the people rising to the top give off the aura of being
infinitely flexible and adaptive, while the people lagging behind end up
in accounting. Whether the “highly adaptive” are really adapting to
change or striking the needed pose is debatable, but it is something
that has become a thing in the corporate world. The highly adaptive are
always wise to never ask why something is changing. They just accept it.

In society as a whole, the jury is out. The last decade has been a good
test of this new reality and the results are mixed. Obama unleashed a
race war in the last two years of his administration that no one saw
coming. Then we had the drama of both party primaries in the 2016
elections. No one saw that coming. Trump winning the nomination and then
the presidency was a total shock. Then it was four years of chaos and
the insane response to the Covid pandemic.

Trump seems like a lifetime ago, yet it has only been a little over a
year since he was deposed and replaced with Joe Biden. Five years ago,
no sane person thought Joe Biden would ever be president. No one saw the
economic chaos that is now starting to define our lives either. We are
just scratching the surface on the economic front, as there are a lot of
chickens coming home to roost. We are seeing things that not so long ago
were declared impossible by the smart set.

There are two conclusions that you can draw from the last decade. One is
the public has been remarkably resilient. The middle-class has taken one
body blow after another, but has staggered on, not doing much to update
its view of society or the people who run the country. This fall, they
will dutifully vote for the B-team, who promise to do more of the same,
just with better looking performers. The Middle American Radicals remain
safely in their pods, munching on their bugs.

The other conclusion is we cannot predict what is coming next. Most
people wisely assumed that tomorrow will look like today, with more of
the stuff that is popular and less of the stuff that is not so popular.
Now, the wise people have to assume that whatever comes next is not
being discussed today. If you want to know the future, find a fringe
weirdo making crazy claims. Every notable thing that has happened over
the last decade was considered aluminum foil hat stuff.

This may be why the Middle American Radicals have been so docile. People
need to time to get angry at their rulers and they need something onto
which to focus their attention as the main issue. By the time the rulers
were willing to tackle inflation in the 1970’s, the people had suffered
with it for years. They had time to digest it, understand it and make
specific demands about the economy. Reagan won in 1980 largely due to
his ability to repeat those demands.

In this age, no one has time to focus on anything very long. We just
spent two years having our rights trampled with Covid and it is now on
its way to being a conspiracy theory because the new issue is Ukraine.
The rage heads on the Left are still struggling to figure out why no one
cares about the study of extremism, but that issue was replaced with
Covid, which is now being replaced with Putin. Things change so quickly
that even the rage heads have no time to get angry.

Of course, the people behind the constant change are living the life of
momentary advantage, where they profit from every turn of the wheel. The
great transfer of wealth from the middle-class to the over-class is one
result. The consolidation of power into the hands of a narrowing elite
is another. The new world of constant change is one where the elite can
front-run what comes next because they are driving it. Everyone else is
left to guess, which means a life of perpetual chaos.

The question no one asks is whether this is sustainable. The
consolidation of power may not be by design, but a necessity. At least
it is an evolutionary reaction to the accelerating pace of change and
uncertainty. Logically, what comes next is some sort of administrative
coup where Biden is replaced by the managerial elite. Will that cause a
revolt or will it be welcomed? Probably the latter, given what is
happening, but maybe that is the point at which the dam breaks.

That is the thing about the world of constant change. No one has time to
plan as the rules keep changing. This is especially true of that
narrowing ruling elite. They need to keep flipping the pages faster in
order to maintain their status, so they can do no long-term planning.
Rule by expediency has a history and it is not a promising one, which
means it does not have a promising future. The disaster in Ukraine is
one example of living in the moment can end in disaster.

What the futurist always get right is that the present modes are running
their course and new modes are on the horizon. What they get wrong is
that those new modes also come with an expiry date. We may be seeing
that with the world Toffler imagined back in the last century. The
accelerating pace of change is reaching an end, because mankind can only
tolerate so much change. The question is whether it ends in fire or ice,
which the poet said would both suffice.
