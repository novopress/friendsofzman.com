I’ve been doing a lot of serious stuff lately, so this week I wanted to
take a break and do some lighter material. The daily outrages you get
from the news can often conceal the absurdity of the world imposed on
us. The people in charge are every bit as clownish and ridiculous as we
think, maybe more so. It’s not they are wrong or are mistaken. They are
ridiculous people with a diminishing grasp on reality. Their
ridiculousness is often amusing, so we should take some time on occasion
to enjoy the freak show for what it is.

Normally, I start with the Huffington Post when looking for goofy
stories. They never disappoint, but there is a whole other world out
there of left-wing craziness too, so I get into some of that this week.
Whenever you think the Left cannot get more ridiculous, always remember
they can find another gear. Crazy has no limits. It’s also good to
remember that current absurdities used to be confined to obscure
websites. In other  words, today’s freak show will most likely be
tomorrow’s normal.

Looking for content this week, the one thing that kept jumping out is
most of it is driven by women and homosexual males. This is not a new
observation, but it probably does not get enough attention, outside of
some precincts in the man-o-sphere. These freaks we see are just
desperate for attention and they will do anything for it. As our
political class gets more feminine and gay, our politics gets more
freakish and absurd. It explains why dissident politics is very male and
very trad female.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I have been
de-platformed by Spotify, because they feared I was poisoning the minds
of their Millennial customers.
