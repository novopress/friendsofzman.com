There will be no show this week as events have conspired against me to
the point where I simply do not have the time to do it properly. Even
though the show is freely available, I take pride in my work. Putting
out a crappy show just to put up something is worse than not doing a
show in my view. While the perfect is the enemy of the good enough, you
still have to have standards.

In order to do the show each week, it takes about four hours of time.
Putting aside any prep work, it takes about ninety minutes to record the
show. It is very hard to talk for an hour, so you have to take some
breaks. There are always weird noises and interruptions to slow things
down. The kittens now have the habit of crashing onto the desk whenever
I sit down to do anything, so that slows up the process.

Once the show is recorded, it has to be edited. When your studio is your
home office, there are always weird noises that get picked up by the
mic. The mic is also much more sensitive than my ears, so editing brings
surprises. Last week, one of the kittens was sitting on the desk while I
was recording. The mic picked up his purring so it sounded like I was
doing the show from a lion’s den.

Editing takes about ninety minutes on good days. Since I am not a sound
engineer, there are times when it takes me half an hour to edit out some
weird background noise or my own weird noises. If you want to know how
poorly you speak, spend a couple hours every week editing your own
voice. I can now recognize my verbal tics just by the shape of the sound
graph.

On top of the four hours to put the show together is prep time and
compiling it for the various locations. Uploading to sites like Rumble
only requires a few minutes, but it is not always trouble free. Most
weeks it takes an hour to get everything compiled and uploaded to the
various platforms. Add it all up and the one-hour show is up to five
hours of work each week, spread out over a few days.

This week I was thrown a curveball by the day job. A client had been
working on a project for months, but forgot to tell me about it. They
needed me to do something that would normally take a couple of weeks,
but I had a week to get it done. This week I have been strapped to a
screen twelve hours a day. As the deadline grew closer, the work
required to finish the project kept growing.

By the time Wednesday rolled around I had done nothing on the show and I
had no time to do even a slapdash job of it. Around midnight Wednesday I
decided to call it a day and do the show on Thursday. I had got ahead of
the project, so I figured I could take the morning to knock out the
show. Thursday morning more bad news from the salt mine hit my desk and
that meant no free time at all.

The next plan was to do it Friday afternoon or evening, but there is a
limit to how much you can use your brain. Around five yesterday I
realized that my brain was no longer working very well, so that was it
for me. I popped open a Guinness becasue nothing heals the brain like
alcohol. As the great philosopher once said, beer is the cause of and
cure for all of life’s problems.

A funny thing happens to you when you get consumed by a project. It is
as if you have been in exile on a remote island. All of the daily tasks
you do out of habit fall by the wayside as you focus only on the work. I
have 160 unread e-mails in my work account, which is something that I
never let happen. I answer work e-mails right away and then move them to
a folder. I am done for the day when the inbox is empty.

Of course, you realize that some of those daily tasks are not important.
A man’s schedule is like an empty drawer. It will be filled with many
useless things that for some reason you think are important. A week like
this revealed a lot of pointless tasks on the schedule that can be
removed. On the other hand, feeding the cat and taking out the trash are
not things that should be ignored.

The other thing a week like this brings to the front of the brain is
that the number of capable people is shrinking. For this project I was
dealing with a group of people I only met this week. Only one from this
new group was competent. He was not always easy to reach becasue he is
competent so the demand for his time is infinite. Luckily, he knows this
and is also conscientious.

This is something happening all over. The reason Elon Musk could fire
eighty percent of the Twitter staff is they did nothing useful. It was
not just that they were there for social justice causes, but that most
of them were useless. This is always a problem, but it seems to be
getting worse. Every company is loaded down with useless people and must
rely on a tiny minority to keep the machine running.

It is always a good idea to remember that the cemeteries are full of
indispensable men, but I do wonder what happens when the capable retire.
For now, there are enough capable people to keep the plates spinning,
but at some point, they simply stop either because they are dead or they
are tired of carrying the burden. The Western world is headed for a
great reset, but not the one the rulers imagine.
