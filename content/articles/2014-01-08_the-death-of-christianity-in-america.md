Something I could not help but notice over the holidays is the near
complete purging of Christ from Christmas. This has been a topic of
debate for years now, but the steady retreat of Christianity from the
public space is remarkable. Not too long ago, America had a president
who was overtly Christian. He talked about Christ in public and
regularly attended services. Within living memory, public figures would
take time during Christmas to proclaim their faith and wish their fellow
Christians Merry Christmas.

Today, we have <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mainstream news sites debating
whether we should move Christmas</a> to a weekend, rather than its
traditional date. I had exactly zero cards this year with the word
Christmas on them. Instead it was happy holidays, as if there were a
variety of holidays from which to choose. When I said “Merry Christmas”
to people, they looked at me like I was a heretic. Not everyone, some
people brightened up and return the favor, but the fact is, the bad guys
have won on the issue of Christmas.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_attendance"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to Wikipedia</a>,
43% of Americans attend church regularly. Without digging into the
statistics, I would expect some large portion of the 57% to be “C&E”
Christians. That is, people who attend at Christmas and Easter. That’s
significant compared to other first world countries. France is at 12%
and Canada are at 20%. These are two nations with historically high
religiosity. Parts of central Europe have attendance rates in the single
digits. In the West, Christianity is just about dead, but America
remains a hold out.

The signs, however, point to that changing. One of those signs is the
near perfect elimination of Christianity from Christmas now.  Within
living memory a mainstream publication would have avoided publishing an
article about moving Christmas. Today it gets a shrug. A lot of that has
to do with the elites abandoning Christianity for multiculturalism and
various Progressive fad. They have also decided that Christianity is for
the bad people, so it has become a mark of goodness to not be a
Christian.

The regional breakout on church attendance is interesting:

The lower rate of church attendance seems to correlate with the embrace
of Progressive politics, but it also tracks with regionalism. At the
bottom is the ancestral home of the American round heads, while the top
is where we find the cavaliers. The one exception is Utah, which was
founded by heretics from the old New England Protestantism. Even so,
there are not a lot of Republican states in the bottom half of that
chart.

There are exceptions, but those exceptions seem to be so-called
battleground states like Florida. I cynical eye would say these states
are slowly sinking into the same morass as the low-marriage, low church
attendance states. In a decade they will go from states that trend
against the Left to states that are reliably Left like Pennsylvania and
Michigan. Every four years the non-liberals would get their hopes up and
think they have a shot to win there, only to find out the Left rallied
enough of their supporters  to carry the day.
