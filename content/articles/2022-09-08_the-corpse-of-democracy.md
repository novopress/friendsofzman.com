The results are in and despite what you have observed in your own life
and on-line, Biden’s Gates of Hell speech was a huge success. According
to a <a
href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/most-americans-see-trumps-maga-as-threat-to-democracy-reuters-ipsos-poll/ar-AA11A5u9"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">new poll</a> close to 60% of Americans
now think Donald Trump and his nefarious “MAGA movement” are a threat to
our democracy. Not only that, 60% of Republicans do not think the MAGA
movement represents the majority of the party. It looks like it is all
over for Trump and the tens of millions who support him.

Now, most MAGA people will dismiss the poll as just another example of
the craven efforts by the regime to prop up their chief stooge. This is,
of course, the result of Putin’s propaganda and disinformation campaign.
These conspiracy theorists questioning the veracity of polling,
especially this poll, are just doing the bidding of Vladimir Putin and
are probably semi-fascists. They are semi-fascists because they do not
know they are being turned into fascists by the Trump movement.

Granted, the details of the poll are not available so there is no way to
examine the crosstabs to see if it supports the press release. The only
clue in the press releases is that the poll was weighted toward
self-identified Democrats. It also subtly suggests that only 25% of the
self-identified Republicans in the poll agree with the claim that Trump
is a danger to the planet. There is growing evidence that the
dispossessed are no longer identifying as Republican, so there is that.

In all seriousness, this is the sort of story that underscores the
problem with mass democracy in the mass communication age. This poll
could be a complete fraud, but there is no way to know. More important,
your favorite news site is never going to check or question it. They
just pick it up as a part of the automated service they use to plug into
news feeds like Reuters. The left-wing news highlighter Matt Drudge is
running this poll in red at the top of his site.

As de Maistre said, “False opinions are like false money, struck first
of all by guilty men and thereafter circulated by honest people who
perpetuate the crime without knowing what they are doing.” Drudge is a
left-wing partisan, but his site is like most news sites these days in
that it relies on feeds to populate itself. Even with site-created
content, there is little editorial control. It is easy to inject a false
opinion into the system and see it get repeated a million times in
minutes.

Of course, there is the other problem. Who cares if a majority of people
are falling for the latest conspiracy theory? That is, after all, what
all this hysteria about Trump and the MAGA movement is, when you examine
it. It relies on the assumption that there are sinister, unseen forces
at work behind the scenes. The old people wearing red Trump caps at the
diner are not just people who hold contrary opinions. They are part of
an invisible army of fascists and evil doers.

Imagine a poll that reported a majority of people thought there are
little green men visiting earth on a regular basis. You do not have to
imagine it. There was a big global <a
href="https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2017/12/global-survey-finds-the-majority-of-humanity-believes-in-aliens/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">survey</a> half a dozen years ago that
claimed a majority of people on earth think there are little green men
out there. A <a
href="https://blogs.chapman.edu/wilkinson/2017/10/11/paranormal-america-2017/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">majority</a> of Americans believe in
ghosts. More people think psychics are real than think Ron Paul is real.
Big Foot is ten times more popular than the vice president of the United
States.

The point is, most people are stupid, at least when it comes to
understanding things that have no direct impact on their lives. They may
know accounting or chemistry, but they can also think disagreeing with
the government is bad for democracy. This has always been the argument
against democracy. Most people lack the desire or capacity to master the
material necessary to make good political choices. Giving them a ballot
is like giving a toddler a hand grenade.

Of course, opinions change. Fifty years ago, when Joe Biden entered
politics, few people thought he should be elected to anything. When he
ran for president in 1988, he was laughed off the stage. In 2008, he was
seen as a joke candidate to give the media some entertainment. In 2020,
his own party preferred an item from the museum of communism, but then
everyone changed their mind all of a sudden. The same change of heart
happened on election night. Opinions change.

Clearly, a polling outfit would know that their polling is a snapshot in
time and may not mean anything in a week. That Reuters poll also reports
that close to 60% of the respondents think the speech will make things
worse. Half never bothered to watch it and two thirds think Biden is a
bum. In other words, the poll is invalid on its face, but it makes for a
handy false opinion, so it gets minted and passed onto gullible dupes
like the rent boys running the Drudge Report.

This is the problem with mass democracy in a mass media age. Our
culture, including the political process, is a giant lie machine.
Imagine if people went about their day with people from the state
following them around with a bullhorn, constantly shouting random
slogans at them. This is what we have today. We are awash in nonsense
from the mass media but are expected to have sensible opinions. It is no
wonder that the political system is <a
href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">unresponsive</a> to the public will.

It is the irony of mass democracy. The stated point of democracy is to
make government more responsive to the public will. Instead, it reveals
that the people who are in charge have no interest in the public will.
They serve other interests. That means those who oppose the prevailing
order should ignore the public will as well. Instead, the focus must
always be on who decides. The solution to the ills of democracy is to
let democracy murder itself and be ready to bury the corpse.
