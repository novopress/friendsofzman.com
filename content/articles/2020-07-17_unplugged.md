Every once in a while, I get complaints about reading too much from news
articles in the show, rather than talking about the subjects. The
logical response is to then do a show in which I have no prepared
material. I just turn on the mic and start talking for an hour on
whatever happens to come to mind. After all, the pendulum is supposed to
swing from one extreme to the other. That is what I have done this week.
I just let it rip on a few topics that were on my mind when I started.

The thing is, I could probably go on a ten hour, Chris Farley rant
without too much trouble, other than the possible stroke. I don’t know
about anyone else, but I am done with the ongoing revolution. It seems
that everywhere we turn, there is some new madness or new tax on our
patience. It is close to impossible to live a normal day, much less a
normal life now. Even the most basic task brings a reminder that we live
in a continent sized lunatic asylum.

All of us are highly adaptable, but there is a limit. Adapting to some
new style or process is not so hard. There is no logic to clothing
styles, for example, so you don’t have to give up your sanity to embrace
the new thing. The same is true of some new way of doing something. If
it saves time or reduces error, adapting to it makes sense, so you
reprogram your mind to it. What we see going on around us is insane and
you can never really adapt to madness. You just tolerate it.

Toleration has its limits. The other day I got an e-mail from a client.
I’m not sure why I was included, as it was an internal e-mail to
employees. The point of the e-mail was to suggest all employees list
their preferred pronouns in their signature. It’s not enough that these
people feel the need to deny reality. They insist that the rest of us
participate in their madness. Everywhere you turn, someone is trying to
make you carry the burden of their madness. It is tax that is never paid
in full.

All of us are amazed, to one degree or another, at how the crazies keep
finding new ways to be crazy in public. I keep waiting for the people in
charge of this simulation to halt the game and laughingly admit they
were just having some fun. The truly remarkable thing, however, is that
some otherwise normal person has not had
<a href="https://youtu.be/x1-axqBZdNk" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">a falling down moment</a>. If any age cried out for a
vigilante it is this one. It is as if the people in charge are trying to
push us to the breaking point.

Maybe our side is reading it all wrong and the vast majority of people
think what is happening is the best thing ever. The people in charge
keep making that point, but that seems unlikely. Instead, it seems that
most people are quietly seething. They distract themselves as best they
can in order to avoid being miserable, but whenever the revolution
intrudes into their lives, their jaw tightens and their fist clinch.
There are a lot of pissed off people walking around these days.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on
<a href="https://www.deezer.com/show/623032" rel="noopener noreferrer"

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stitcher</a> for the weirdos.
YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
below.

discount to readers of this site. You just click on the
<a href="https://alaskachaga.us/discount/ZMAN" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">this link</a> and they take care of the rest. About a
year ago they sent me some of their stuff. Up until that point, I had
never heard of chaga, but I gave a try and it is very good. It is like a
tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.

For sites like this to exist, it requires people like you chipping in a
few bucks a month to keep the lights on and the people fed. It turns out
that you can’t live on clicks and compliments.

bucks, rather than have that latte at Starbucks. Thank you for your
support!
