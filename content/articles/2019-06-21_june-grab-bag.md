Being new to the monetization game, I’m learning things about the world
that I never put thought into until now. I went to the P.O. Box for the
first time last week and discovered it was full of letters and
donations. I must admit, I was taken aback by it. Like most people, I
don’t get much of anything in the mail these days. I get the occasional
notice from a government agency or something from our corporate
overlords, but otherwise the mail is junk. Most days, all of it ends up
in the trash.

Opening old fashioned envelopes with handwritten notes inside was
something I have not done in so long it was like learning a new skill.
There really is something different about reading a handwritten letter,
even a printed one, that is different from reading an e-mail or comment.
It is similar to the difference between reading a book or newspaper
versus reading on-line. Maybe it is just nostalgia, but there is a
difference. It’s not just the tactile sensation of it. The brain seems
to work different too

Initially I though the right thing to do was to send thank you notes,
but most of the correspondence did not have a return address. The point,
for most, is to maintain anonymity, so that makes sense. I abandoned the
thank you card idea and thought a roster of first names and states, but
maybe that’s not a good idea. While I noodle over that, thank you to all
of those sending donations and words of encouragement through to the
post office box. You know who you are.

Now, for Subscribestar members, I am putting a little content up there
on the weekends, just as an experiment in paywall content. I’m not sure
where I want to go with the donor content just yet, so I’m in my
experimental phase right now. I think at some point I will just create a
premium space here for all donors and subscribers, but I’ll play around
with the Subscribestar site for a while as I experiment with different
ideas. I’m a big believer is measuring twice, in order to cut once. I’m
also open to suggestions.

If you care about your community and want to support those working hard
on your behalf, consider supporting my work by donating the price of a
beer or a cup of coffee at
Starbucks. <a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/the-z-blog"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Five bucks a month</a> is not a lot to ask.
Unlike those mega-corporations, I will not use your money to destroy
your family and community. Or, you can send money to me at: Z Media LLC
P.O. Box 432 Cockeysville, MD 21030-0432. I now have a <a
href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=UDAS2Q8JYA6CN&amp;source=url"
rel="noopener noreferrer">PayPal</a> setup for those who prefer that
method to donate. Thank you for your support!

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
