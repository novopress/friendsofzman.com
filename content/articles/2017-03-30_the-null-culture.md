Tyler Cowen is one of those guys worth reading in the same way Thomas
Friedman used to be worth reading. There’s nothing about his arguments
or analysis that is new or interesting. In fact, when he ventures into
these areas he reveals a mediocre mind. The value is that he provides an
insight into the thinking of the Cloud People with regards to the issues
of the day. He’s a weathercock for the Cloud People.

Maybe this is intentional or maybe it is accidental. That can be debated
and many of his most loyal fans start from the assumption that it is
intentional. They believe his cryptic writing style is to encourage a
hermeneutic reading of his posts and columns. Cowen indirectly
encourages this by constantly referring to Strauss as if he is a deity.
Many of his posts have a “read between the lines young grasshopper? vibe
to them.

Another way to look at this style is that it is intended to mask the
fact that he has no new insights or ideas to offer, so he puts the focus
on the alleged game of expository cat and mouse. In the same way female
pop stars dress like whores to hide their lack of talent, writers like
Kevin Williamson, for example, rely on bloated prose to mask their lack
of talent. Maybe that’s Cowen’s game.

Regardless, <a

target="_blank">his latest column on Bloomberg</a> is an example of his
usefulness as a window into the hive mind of the Cloud People.

One of the remarkable things about the Cloud People is they have a
non-linear timeline that has more holes than the fossil record. For most
of them. the world started in the 1960’s. That’s because the Cloud is
dominated by Boomers, but it is also when the Cloud started to form up
as a social force. The result is they have two versions of the past.
Their past, the 60’s and 70’s, and the long ago past, when Lincoln
defeated Hitler.

This ahistorical world view is why they reflexively compare every
foreign leader to Hitler and every problem in world affairs to Munich.
It’s even more present tense for domestic matters. They have never
stopped fighting the Civil Rights Movement. T.N. Coates makes $50K a
speech because <a
href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/tanehisi-coates-between-the-world-and-me/397619/"
target="_blank">his kid brushed up against an old white women on an
escalator</a> once and that was just like the cops attacking the blacks
at Selma.

Anyway, Cowen is obsessed with food and the so-called foodie culture. He
correctly points out that this is a common obsession in the Cloud. He
does not phrase it that way as that would require a degree of
self-awareness he does not posses. Many of his posts and columns are
about his trips to find something new to eat. Whenever he is preparing
for a tax-payer funded junket overseas, he posts a bleg for restaurant
tips.

So-called foodie culture is interesting in that it is not really a
culture. It is the result of lack of culture. The people endlessly
searching for a new dish or new cuisine do so because they have nothing
of their own or at least nothing they wish to hold up as their own. The
endless search for some new exotic cuisine is a distraction from facing
the fact that their own culture is dead and its artifacts are now just
museum pieces.

Culture is the spirit of the people. Their customs, foods and social
structures are the result. The moveable feast that is foodie culture is
not a celebration of something holy or sacred. It is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva_(Judaism)"
target="_blank">shiva</a> for people who no longer have any attachment
to the rest of us or our share past. They see themselves as rootless
visitors, sampling life in the hope that it will provide their lives
with meaning, or at least make them mildly interesting to others.

Foodie culture is a null culture, the abnegation of culture. The Cloud
Person going on about the food stalls they visited in Thailand is
someone trying hard to not be from here, to not be *of* here, to not be
a part of you. It’s why fusionism is so popular in the foodie world. It
lets every person have their own thing, so they can avoid sharing their
thing with others and therefore avoid the burdens and responsibilities
of shared culture.

It also is why the managerial state and the Cloud People society
dependent on it is brittle and fracturing. It has nothing to offer. If
culture is old men planting trees in whose shade they will never sit,
the managerial state is the burning of those trees in an outdoor fire
pit so the imported cook from Thailand can prepare traditional dishes
from his homeland. The former outlives the man, while the later cannot
outlive the fire.
