One of the many strange things about this age is that the most urgent
issue facing the developed world gets the least amount of attention.
That urgent thing is the collapse of fertility in every country with
indoor toilets. Even India, a country famous for outdoor toilets, is
having a baby bust. Indian fertility is now below replacement and,
according to recent reports, is following the rest of Asia off the
cliff.

In the EU, there are currently 1.46 live births per woman. France has
the highest TFR at 1.84 live births per woman, but that is mostly the
foreign population. The rest of Europe has birthrates well below
replacement. Spain and Italy are at 1.3, which is what demographers call
a population collapse. The only place in Europe with a healthy TFR is
the Faroe Islands, which lies east of Iceland.

The Occident is doing well compared to the developed parts of Asia. Hong
Kong no longer has children, as there is less than one live birth per
woman. South Korea is right there with a TFR of 0.6. China is at 1.2,
which should be what gets the ruling class to take notice, given China’s
rocket high fertility in the recent past. It seems that wherever there
are good times, people have stopped making babies.

This flies in the face of what we think we knew about biology. It has
been assumed, because history seems to confirm it, that in good times
people tend to have more children, while in bad times they limit their
children. It is why Western nations cooked up schemes to limit
reproduction during the Industrial Revolution. It was assumed that
improving living standards would result in overpopulation.

The great global baby bust is telling us something. One is that what we
thought we understood about demographics and population is wrong. When
what was predicted did not happen, instead you got the opposite, it is
time to rethink everything. The other is that there is a combination of
forces that have been unleashed leading to what is looking like a great
pruning of the human population.

That is the show this week. Everyone has their favorite reason for the
population collapse, but those answers are probably wrong for the simple
reason they assume a one-to-one relationship. In reality, complex things
like human reproduction have highly complex causal relationships. That
means the population collapse is most certainly do to a combination of
things working in concert.
