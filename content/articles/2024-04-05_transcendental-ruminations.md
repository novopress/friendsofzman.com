An aspect of our increasingly ideological age is the things that used to
be a part of the culture that have been removed by force or by neglect.
The parts pried loose and discarded are easy to see, as they come with
an angry mob of deranged lunatics there to do the damage. The bits that
are just forgotten and fall out of the shared reality that is our
culture are the things missed only by those who remember them.

The opening of the show today is one of those bits that has fallen out
of shared reality mostly due to neglect. When I was a young person, you
had to read Thoreau and Emerson, so you could learn about
transcendentalism. Speaking with younger people recently it seems that
stopped happening at some point. The old hippie teachers gave way to
activists who have no interest in those old white men.

Transcendentalism is a peculiarity of America that not only influenced
what became progressivism but also its traveling partner conservatism.
You could probably draw a line from Thoreau and Emerson to the weird
secular Gnosticism that emerged in the aftermath of the Cold War. Modern
progressive rejects individualism, but they embrace the idea of society
corrupting the natural goodness of man.

Another line you could draw is from the second wave transcendentalists,
who were mostly bourgeois aesthetes, to the middle-class managerial
elite of today. Rather than rejecting empiricism, like the first wave
transcendentalist, the second wave embraced it but in the context of
individual expression. In other words, they loved science as long as it
supported their emotional claims.

As nutty as they were, the transcendentalists represented an aspect of
American culture that remains with us today. There are hints of it in
the parallel society movement and the trad-life stuff that is popular
with some young right-wing people. The desire to break free of the
corrupting aspects of modern society in order to have an authentic life
is something that the transcendentalist would have understood.
