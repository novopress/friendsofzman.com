Something that has gone largely unnoticed is that the people who used to
litter the streets screaming “racism” have disappeared. They have not
gone away, but they have suddenly been marginalized. They spend their
days on sites like Bluesky wondering why no one seems to care what they
have to say anymore. The sites that used to pay for them to be pests are
no longer interested in their material.

One possible reason for this is that racism may have run its course.
This novel moral concept that emerged a century ago may have finally
burned itself out in the last great moral panic. White people are no
longer concerned that their observations of the world may be at odds
with the morality of these strange people who demanded we worship a
violent drug addict like George Floyd.

It is hard to imagine, given that racism as a sin has been with us since
anyone can remember, but it is a novel concept. A century ago, few
people would have understood the word at all, much less incorporated the
concept. Even fifty years ago it was possible to dismiss the idea. In
the long history of human civilization, this weird idea is nothing more
than a strange middle-class fad.

The fad may have come to an end. Trump whacking away at things like
affirmative action and disparate impact, with little howling from any
one could signal something bigger than the death of the racism concept.
It may signal the end to the long experiment to overcome the natural
diversity of man. The search for racial equality, like the search for
bigfoot, may be a fool’s errand coming to an end.
