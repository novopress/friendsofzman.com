A popular concept in right wing politics is the *gatekeeper* or
sometimes called the *controlled opposition*. This is the person or
group that appears to be in opposition to the Left, but is an insulation
layer between the Left and genuine critics. The function of the
gatekeeper is to prevent people from abandoning the political morality
of the Left, while at the same time making sure to lose every fight with
the Left. They channel opposition into positions that can never succeed.

Ben Shapiro is the most obvious example. His primary role is to funnel
all opposition into a dead end. His answer to the tech monopolies, for
example, is to tell people to build their own new internet. After all,
only a communist would demand the government prevent private actors from
trampling your rights. Of course, he always tone policing the language
of the people he claims to represent. The point is also to cleanse the
language of rhetoric that could be effective against the Left.

What gets little discussion is just how this happens. There is an
assumption that the people playing the role of gatekeeper know what they
are doing. This is that bourgeois objectivism that is the bane of
right-wing politics. It is the assumption that all political actors are
motivated by self-interest. They are keenly aware of those interests and
their actions reflect it. Therefore, people on the Right assume the
gatekeepers are acting with purpose and are probably in league with the
Left.

A good example of this is the CRT business. Parents around the country
suddenly learned that the schools are teaching their kids that white
people are born evil and their only way to salvation is to hate their
ancestors. The gatekeepers immediately <a
href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/chris-rufo-accuses-washington-post-of-telling-outright-lies-about-his-anti-crt-push/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">leapt into action</a> to lecture them
that saying CRT is antiwhite is wrong. Suddenly, the purpose of
conservatism is to prevent anyone from noticing that the cultural
revolution is explicitly and overtly antiwhite. It almost seems
<a href="https://twitter.com/ScottMGreer/status/1407205852415762435"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">coordinated</a>.

There is a familiar pattern to how the system has responded to
opposition to the antiwhite pogroms launched by the party. The defunct
social media platform Parler was not about creating an alternative to
Twitter, so much as creating a regime-acceptable alternative to the
genuinely open platform Gab. When that failed, the usual suspects were
ready with another version called
<a href="https://retalk.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Retalk</a>.
Many of the <a
href="https://media.gab.com/system/media_attachments/files/069/629/068/original/7b9df2cc81d489fc.png"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">people</a> promoting this effort were
anti-Trump cranks now trying to lure his audience.

An underappreciated aspect of the gatekeeper production system is just
how quickly it spits out hollow clones of legitimate opposition. Once
Nick Fuentes started getting national attention, the clone machine
started making copies. Here is a fake <a
href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/547996-trump-alumni-launch-america-first-policy-institute"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">America First clone</a> produced soon
after the election. Fuentes has been promoting the term “America First”
for a while. He sells branded products and his supporters wave big flags
at rallies with that slogan, so the system just cloned it.

The system also appears to be trying to clone Fuentes himself and his
imitators among the young generation. Here is a group called
<a href="https://www.americanmoment.org/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">American Moment</a>, formed by four young gay men to be
an acceptable version of the groypers. The system men were out flogging
it as if it were coordinated. Here is National Review <a
href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/if-i-could-take-a-moment/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">promoting</a> it. Here is <a
href="https://americanmind.org/salvo/dear-conservative-inc-follow-or-get-out-of-the-way/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">American Mind</a>, promoting itself by
promoting the fake groypers. As if by magic a group of nobodies was
suddenly a topic of conversation.

In the effort to co-opt Fuentes and his youth movement, we see a pattern
emerge in how gatekeepers are created. First, we get the fake version of
the genuine alternative mentioned in conservative media. Then what
quickly follows is a halfhearted negation of the fake version of the
alternative. This pseudo-dialectic is supposed to draw in those unhappy
with the system. They have to pick a side in this fake debate. The point
is to exclude the genuine opposition from the process.

The sandwich technique is a staple of liberal democratic politics. Since
few arguments in favor of the status quo can withstand scrutiny, they
create a set of false choices to contain all discussion. In economics
the choice is “free enterprise” versus “communism” with regards to
corporate corruption of society. In other issues, like the race debate,
one choice is an absurdly immoral position and defeatism. You either
buckle under or you are a Nazi, and you deserve the assault from the
Left.

Of course, the main project of so-called conservatives is to figure out
a way to create a fake Trump in order to sideline the populist and
nationalist opposition to the corporatist uniparty monopoly. Trump did
not get anything done in office, but the system still fears him, because
of the bad thoughts he arouses in the people. Trump running in 2024
would both reveal the ridiculousness of conservatism (again) and
generate the sorts of conversations that the regime considers dangerous.

The first version of fake Trump is <a
href="https://unherd.com/thepost/can-j-d-vance-offer-trumpism-without-trump/?=frpo"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">J.D. Vance</a>. He is a more successful
version of the character Keven Williams has played at National Review.
That is, a guy from flyover country who abandoned the people and culture
that produced him in order to confirm the biases of the managerial
elite. He provides them with authenticity, by displaying a sympathy for
and a knowledge of the Dirt People, the great dispossessed, but he
confirms the Cloud People patronizing view of them.

You will notice that the system defends itself with rhetoric. Democracy
is all about winning arguments, not establishing, or accepting truth. It
is why democracy produces so many sophists. It is also why Twitter is so
popular with regime lackeys. People with the natural instinct to defend
their masters and a gift for doing so in a few sentences can become
heroes on the platform. A system built on clever rhetoric and logical
fallacies is naturally good at defending itself with the same tools.

This natural defense does have its limits. A decade ago, the Tea Party
movement was easily coopted by
<a href="https://www.rstreet.org/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">corporate flunkies</a>. This time it is struggling to do
the same thing with the populism Trump rode to office and the growing
dissident movement. The fake groypers, for example, cannot draw flies.
Their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4qmB5DeiFxt53ZPZiW4Tcg"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube</a> shows should have crickets as
the background noise. This is despite the hype and protection. Fuentes
and his merry band draw tens of thousands to obscure platforms.

It could very well be that this natural defense mechanism only works if
the system itself is viewed as fundamentally legitimate. Once people
begin to think the system is rigged or inherently corrupt, the defense
mechanisms not only fail, but they also become proof of the corruption.

their management to Bangalore recently because the site no longer has an
audience. In other words, the failure of gatekeeping is a sign of
systemic failure.
