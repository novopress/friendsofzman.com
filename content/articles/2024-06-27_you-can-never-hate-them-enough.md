To great fanfare Julian Assange struck a deal with the American
government whereby he would be allowed to leave a British jail and
return home to Australia. Reportedly, the deal he accepted was to plead
guilty to some charges in exchange for a sentence of time served in the
British jail. The full details of the deal have not been released, but
most likely he gave the government information they wanted or
sufficiently demonstrated that he was not in possession of it.

This was always the primary issue. Secret documents and information leak
out of the government all the time, but the government knows who leaked
it. Most of the time the leaks are official leaks. Someone with
authorized access to something hands it over to someone in regime media
to publish. Once in a while the people at the top of the regime get mad
about this habit and demand to know the source, and the regime reporter
puts on a show of resisting but gives in at the end.

Generally speaking, what the regime cares most about in the case of
these leaks is the source of the leak and the method they used. If
regime information is getting into the public through unknown channels
or by unknown figures, it can not only lead to things in the public the
regime does not want made public, but it threatens the legitimacy of the
regime for the people inside the regime. Blackmail, for example, only
works when the victim is sure the blackmailer has control of the
information.

A big part of what makes the managerial system of the Global American
Empire work is the trust the people in the system have in the system.
The yawning gap we see between the confidence of regime figures and
their ability is due in large part to their trust in the system. For
them, the system works, so they naturally assume their elevation inside
the system is due to merit. A loss of control of the system could lead
to a loss of trust and the whole thing spins apart.

Putting that aside, the only good thing about Assange getting released
is that the worst people can no longer wave around that bloody shirt.
For close to two decades, fringy irritants have been using the Assange
case to demonstrate their moral purity and to defend the crackpot idea
that journalism is a priesthood. Their defense of Assange always rested
on the dubious claim that journalists have special rights and therefore
must not be subject to the laws governing the rest of us.

You see, once you call yourself a journalist, you get to ignore the
rules of decency, the laws governing private property and declare
yourself a moral authority. You get to betray confidences and deceive
people about your intentions. You also get to steal the property of
others and use it for personal gain. All the while, you get to wrinkle
up your nose as if you caught wind of a bad odor and lecture the rest of
us about your moral goodness and our moral failings.

The game here was to hold Assange up as a paragon of virtue because he
was upholding the highest standards of journalism. He was doing the same
thing major media does all the time, namely revealing secrets about the
regime. In reality, Assange was just trying to avoid an American prison.
Like every other person calling himself a journalist, Assange was a
dirtbag and a thief. He trafficked in stolen goods for personal benefit
and when he got caught, he tried to avoid punishment.

If you are clear headed about this, the correct response to the Assange
case is the opposite than that of the moralizers. Information is
property and people who traffic in stolen information should be treated
like any other thief. In fact, they should be treated more harshly.
Stolen property can be replaced, but stolen information is often
irreplaceable and the damage that ensues from its theft can last a
lifetime. Information thieves should be killed on the spot.

In other words, the right response to the Assange case was not to treat
him as a hero but to demand that all journalists get the same treatment.
Imagine a world where doxers have to flee the country and hide out in
embassies to avoid being sent to prison and you will immediately see the
logic. Imagine if the people who stole Trump’s tax returns and gave them
to the New York Times were sent to the gallows along with the people who
agreed to publish them. Nice thought, isn’t it?

The defense of journalism has always been a moral perversion. The worst
people a society can produce end up in journalism. The fact that they
from time to time do harm to terrible people is not just used as a
reason to elevate these garbage people, but a reason to sacralize their
gutter morality. Journalists are good people, so the reasoning goes,
because they are more degenerate than politicians. Assange was
celebrated because he represented the ideal of this gutter morality.

Those calling themselves journalists, but lack a place in regime media,
have noted that regime journalists have been silent on Assange. The main
reason is regime journalists are moral nullities. They envy the
attention Assange is getting, so they use the only power they have to
smite him. The main power of regime media is the power to ignore, so
they were happy to ignore Assange. There is no honor among thieves, so
the thieving weasels of the media can never honor one of their own.

Despite his position at the bottom of the moral hierarchy, Assange was
useful as a regime irritant, thus proving no life is entirely
meaningless. Hopefully, his final contribution is to sink quietly into
obscurity. The moralizers who have used his name to elevate the worst
profession and the worst people will have to find a new bloody shirt to
wave around in defense of the despicable trade. The rest of us can
return to hating the worst people, because you can never hate them
enough.
