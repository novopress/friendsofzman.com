The absurdity of America’s racial politics is no more obvious than in
sports, where a collection of low-IQ jocks and circus performers wrestle
with the irreconcilable contradictions of race and racial morality.
Everyone involved is smart enough to understand the message they are
required to push, but they lack the brainpower to make it work. Guys
like [Stephen A. Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2MDWrfToX0) or
[Michael Wilbon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux03jkdeeT0) come off
as white nationalist parodies.

The NFL is probably the best place to see the ridiculousness, as that
league has been trying hard to racially atone for the last twenty years.
The NBA has been a black sport for generations now. Even the coaches are
black. Hockey and baseball are impossible to make into black sports,
because running and jumping are not critical qualities in either game.
Outside of a few positions, running and jumping are important qualities
in American football.

The main area of focus in the NFL has been quarterback, which is a
position dominated by white players. The assumption has always been that
the position requires smarts, and, well, you know. The league has been
working to make it easier for the passing game by limiting what
defenders can do. By making it easier to pass the ball, the threshold
for being a quarterback has dropped. Add in changes to enhance the value
of running quarterbacks and you get more black quarterbacks.

This is not all due to racial morality. The target audience for the NFL
is declining in IQ so they are dumbing down their sport to chase the
audience. Stupid people like to see simple plays where the star does all
the work. Complex offenses that require field generalships are no fun to
the typical fan. It will not be long before CGI is added to make the
games more interesting for television. Maybe a new play will be the Fast
& Furious style car chase.

A feature of football broadcasts is the talking heads assuring us that
the quarterback who makes his living running the ball, a guy like Lamar
Jackson, for example, is actually winning through intelligence.
Jackson’s <a
href="https://wonderlictestpractice.com/lamar-jackson-wonderlic-test-score/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">test scores</a> say he is a full standard
deviation below the typical quarterback, but we are told he is a
football genius. In reality, he is just faster than everyone else at the
moment. He is the Michael Vick of this generation, less the dog fighting
business.

This demand to respect the intelligence of the new vibrant quarterback
is turning up in the controversy over Tua Tagovailoa. He was
[slammed](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/tua-tagovailoa-injury-nflpa-executive-director-says-it-plans-to-pursue-every-legal-option/)
to the turn in a game and suffered a serious concussion. He was carted
off on a back board and sent to the hospital for evaluation. The sports
commentariat has been ordered to put on their outrage faces over this.
How dare the league put this young genius at risk by letting him take a
blow to the head!

The video looks like one of those things that happens in sports.
Whenever one human being tries to throw another human being onto the
ground, there is a chance someone is going to get hurt. Given that
hitting the ground means sudden deceleration, concussions are to be
expected. Anyone who has played football or boxed or wrestled has had
their bell rung more than once. It is just a thing that happens, no
matter how hard you try to prevent it.

Of course, concussions are a controversial issue. A whole new racket has
grown up around the dubious claims from the CTE people. The term is
short for Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. Concussions probably have
some negative impact on brain function, but the science is unclear. The
CTE business is mostly a scam, which has a racial element to it. The guy
who sold the idea is named [Bennett
Omalu](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/sports/cte-bennet-omalu/).
Will Smith played him in a movie.

The racial angle in the concussion story gets even more nutty when you
look at the efforts to remediate the issue. The NFL has set up a fund to
compensate players claiming to suffer from CTE. The NFL is [race
norming](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/08/02/race-norming-nfl-concussion-settlement/)
the concussion settlements to reduce payouts, which brings out the
[usual
suspects](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/race-norming-nfl-concussions/).
You see, Jamal is stupid because of the concussion, not because of
genetics. It is a classic example of biological reality slamming into
racial and political morality.

The truth is no one knows if concussions have a direct or even an
indirect connection on cognitive issues later in life. We have always
known that taking blows to the head is bad for you. We have the term
“punchy” for a reason. Boxers who took too many blows over their career
were often quite stupid later in life. It has always been assumed that
it is the blows to the head, but no one really knows for sure. Maybe
they started out stupid, which is why they took so many shots to the
head.

There is a good chance that IQ plays a role. Intelligence strongly
correlates with health outcomes, so it is possible that it plays a role
in concussions. Higher IQ players may suffer fewer concussions or suffer
less from them than low-IQ players. Boxers have never been known as
smart guys, so maybe the reason they seem punchy in their later years is
the combination of blows and their low-IQ. Maybe smarter people are
better at avoiding concussion and recovering from them.

None of this is allowed to be said, so it does not matter much. The NFL
is going to have to pay for these black former players. In a way, it is
like the ongoing demands by blacks for compensation because of slavery.
The math is not the issue. It is the moral blackmail that comes once you
accept the current morality of race. The NFL, like white society, can
never pay for the sins of the past, but it must keep paying.
Discrimination is a nightmare from which will never awake.

In the larger context, the dumbing down of the sport and the
presentation of it, corresponds with the dumbing down of race relations.
Half a century ago, race relations were better because they were more
thoughtful. Both sides sought an accommodation based on what was
possible. Today it is two tribes flinging their poo not at one another,
but at the rest of us. Like car chases in movies, race relations are now
part of the menticide inflicted on our society.
