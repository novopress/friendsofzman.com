This week is one of those shows where I just turn on the mic and talk
for an hour off the top of my head without knowing where I am going with
it. Some people think these are the best shows, but I am skeptical. The
inspiration for the show is a post I did earlier in the week behind the
green door. The topic of that post was the difficulty enjoying old
movies and television as a dissident.

Once you are aware of why Jake from State Farm is a black guy now, you
see the tentacles of the people behind it in all sorts of things. Those
old movies you enjoyed a million years ago suddenly look different to
you. You notice the little bits of subversion in them that has led to
where we are now. You cannot enjoy them as you once did because you see
what you did not see the first time.

Thinking about it, this extends to other things. Once your eyes are
opened to certain things, you turn into Roddy Randy Piper from *They
Live*. You keep putting on the dissident classes, seeing things that
maybe you wished you had not seen, but you cannot stop doing it. In the
show I used the example of Ronald Reagan, who many here no doubt grew up
thinking of as a great president.

This may not sound too bad, but it does bring the risk of turning the
dissident into someone incapable of feeling joy. You cannot watch a
movie or television show without getting angry about the subversion. A
mindless thing like a sporting event turns into another arena of the
great struggle. If you are not careful, you cut yourself off from your
fellow citizens with regards to the popular culture.

More important, you can find yourself at war with the past. For
left-wing radicals, this is a good thing as they want to be free of the
past. Normie, of course, wants to return to some mythical place in the
past. Dissidents do not want to be free of the past, but have an honest
relationship with it, in order to figure out what comes next. This is a
unique challenge to the modern dissident.
