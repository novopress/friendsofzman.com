Another week is in the books and we are a little closer to what is
shaping up to a summer of madness. If you have been paying attention to
the Chauvin trial, you will see that we are headed to a very bad place.
The state’s case so far boils down to “He may have not paid careful
attention in a safety class years ago, so he is guilty.” They have not
even tried to address the key questions of the case. In a first world
country, this trial would not exist. The court would not allow it.

If you read the summaries of the trial, you cannot help but wonder if
both sides are trying to throw the case. The state called one witnesses
that was so bad for their case, the defense added her to their witness
list. Another witness had to admit that the cops probably should have
been rougher with Saint George. Unless you are there every day, it is
hard to get a read on these things, but it looks as if the state is not
even trying to give the jury a reason to convict this guy of anything.

The defense has not been stellar either. At this stage they are limited
to cross examination, so we will see when it is their turn to put on a
show. So far, they seem to be happy to let the state’s witnesses do
their best to undermine the state’s case. Given the levels of corruption
in modern America, you have to wonder if the defense has not been told
to throw the case. In a banana republic like America, in the halls of
justice, the only justice is in the halls. The fix is always in.

Again, it is hard to judge these things from a distance. The O. J.
Simpson trial is the obvious parallel. A blind man could see that
Simpson was guilty, but the defense was allowed to turn the trial into a
racial circus. For the jury, it stopped being about facts and law and
became a weird sort of beauty pageant. They picked a winner based on how
it made them feel at the moment. This jury could have made up its mind
in advance and they not paying any attention to any of this.

The thing that may save Chauvin is the jury does not have many whites on
it and has quite a few black women. For starters, this is Minnesota, so
the white people there are thoroughly and completed cucked. If this were
an all-white jury, they would be arriving to court with shirts reading
“we’re so sorry.” The black women know all about guys like Saint George
Floyd. If the state cannot make him look like their son, instead of
their son’s ne’er-do-well father, the state has a problem.

Like people, societies make their own luck. This is a terrible case to
use for a remake of *To Kill A Mockingbird*. Floyd is not a sympathetic
character. The world is better place without him. On the other hand,
Chauvin is not a good guy either. The cops everywhere are out of control
and people are increasingly sick of it. The prosecutors are incompetent,
and the defense thus far is not much better. The way to bet here is the
jury will turn out to be just as bad as everything else with this case.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
