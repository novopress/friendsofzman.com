In the fullness of time, whoever is writing the story of the American
experiment will marvel over the fact that the United States never
understood itself and as a result, was eventually destroyed in a
struggle with itself. A land with vast resources and a capable people
could never move past a central problem that stepped off the Mayflower
to start the American story. That problem is how can you build a society
that derives equality from inequality?

At every step in the American story, we see this conflict. One the one
hand, what drives the efforts of the American people is the desire to
equalize not only American society, but the society of man. On the other
hand, there is the grudging acknowledgment that what lies between here
and the egalitarian paradise if the impenetrable barrier called the
natural inequality of man. Despite the unconquerable truth of the human
condition, what drives America is the desire to overcome it.

This conflict is right there in the founding myths. The colonists
rebelled against the symbol of hierarchy and innate inequality, the King
of England. They did so on the grounds that all men have the same
rights. It is right there in the powerful opening of the Declaration of
Independence, perhaps the greatest celebration of egalitarianism ever
written, but written by a man who was the gold standard of both the
natural inequality of man and the necessity of hierarchy.

This contradiction is right there in the life of Thomas Jefferson. He
was a man of aristocratic stock, born into a wealthy family. He was
living proof that Mother Nature does not distribute her gifts equally.
He supported the redistribution of land to the poor, despite the fact he
was a wealthy planter and slave owner. Despite the reality of his life,
he was also capable of expressing the egalitarian spirit in such
powerful and direct language that it continues to haunt the nation he
helped create.

Modern America, the Global American Empire, is the product of the innate
American egalitarianism, but also the willingness to use violence in the
unequal relationship between America and the rest of the world. The
regular speeches we hear from politicians about America’s role in the
world would be familiar to Thucydides. On the one hand those speeches
are a form of the funeral

rel="noopener" target="_blank">oration</a> of Pericles and on the other
hand the frank <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">dialogue</a> with the people of Melos.

The present crisis of America is the product of this great
contradiction. In his
<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">majority opinion</a> in Student for Fair
Admissions v. Harvard College, Chief Justice John Roberts struggles with
this very question. Much of the opinion, in fact, is a recitation of how
the country has struggled with this question. Often, Roberts laments
that the court has failed to live up to those ideals of equality, but
then he acknowledges that impenetrable barrier called the natural
inequality of man.

In his discussion of Plessy, the case that established the doctrine of
separate but equal, Roberts argues that despite the intent and the
remedies to address defects in the doctrine, the result was
institutional inequality in education. Roberts writes, “the  
inherent folly of that approach—of trying to derive equality from
inequality—soon became apparent.” The remedy was to scrap it entirely in
the famous Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka decision.

Note that in a 237-page decision lamenting the history of discrimination
and challenges in addressing it, the central problem lies in just one
sentence. You cannot derive equality from inequality. If Mother Nature
does not distribute her gifts equally, a truth not only visible to the
casual eye, but supported by mountains of data, then the equality of man
is impossible and any effort to achieve it is folly. Despite this
immutable truth, the court continues its quest to reach the egalitarian
paradise.

Right there is the beating heart of the current crisis. For going on
three generations now, the moral arbiter of America society, the Supreme
Court, has demanded that we press ahead with a project it knows is
impossible. The moral regime that makes the open society as the highest
good and discrimination as the worst evil, which grew from the Brown
decision, is all about finding, at long last, some way over or around
that impenetrable barrier called the natural inequality of man.

The moralizing is clear in the text of the decision. Roberts often blurs
the lines between legal discrimination and general discrimination,
because to make such a distinction suggests the latter is acceptable
under the right conditions. Instead, the starting place is the assertion
that discrimination is always immoral, but for now certain exceptions
must be made until we work out a few things. Affirmative action, for
example, is a temporary fix until equality is achieved.

Think about how many social problems could easily be solved by simply
acknowledging that impenetrable barrier called the natural inequality of
man. If the court said that Harvard is a private college and so it can
admit who it likes for any reason it likes, this case never sees a
courtroom. Public universities, on the other hand, must admit everyone
that meets the objective criteria for admissions. Debates over college
admissions would vanish instantly.

Simply acknowledging objective reality about human beings would solve
many of the problems in present day America, but it is impossible. The
belief in the equality of man is too powerful with the managerial class.
John Roberts and his staff wrote 237-pages of text to cover over “it is
folly trying to derive equality from inequality.” Since the middle of
the last century, all efforts have been mustered to defeat that simple
truth, but it remains that impenetrable barrier called the natural
inequality of man.
