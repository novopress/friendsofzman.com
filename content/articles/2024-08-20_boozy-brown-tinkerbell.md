Anyone who has been part of a failed enterprise or has done a
post-mortem on one is familiar with the weird psychology that comes to
dominate the leadership of the enterprise as it reaches its final stage.
At some point, the people in charge begin to assume their plans to
arrest the decline are working as their default position, rather than
taking a wait and see approach. A combination of hope and the desire to
remain optimistic clouds their view of reality.

This is why the people inside of a failed company are often shocked when
the collapse arrives and they are suddenly out of a position. Some
people may have noticed that in their small piece of the puzzle things
did not look exactly right, but the big bosses maintained a positive
outlook, even as they were made aware of the problems. A form of social
proof manifests where everyone inside overlooks the problems because
management remains optimistic.

The funny thing about this dynamic is that the people at the top are
often as shocked as the rank and file when the final collapse arrives.
The history books are full of failed banks, for example, scrambling at
the last minute to secure additional capital when it should have been
clear for months that the bank was toast. The people running Enron had
convinced themselves that their shell game could go on much longer if
they could just get some additional capital.

Another great example of this is the mortgage crisis. Long before the
handful of smart people inside the system realized what was happening,
normal people began to wonder how poor people were affording
middle-class houses. All of a sudden, the guy riding a leaf blower at
your office park is living in your neighborhood. Normal people wondered
how the banks could possibly accept the crazy loans at the time. Right
up to the last-minute, however. insiders were sure the system was fine.

The mortgage crisis is probably the one to think about as the regime
kicks off the biggest gaslighting party in human history. The Democratic
convention is something like the lavish parties the mortgage industry
threw for itself in Las Vegas in the months leading up to the crash. On
the one hand, there are signs of trouble, but on the other hand the
party is too much fun to think about those things. The red flags popping
up here and there are a reason to party even harder.

One way to look at this gaslighting operation is as the final chapter in
a story that started way back in the Trump term. The people chanting “by
any means necessary” created a narrative in which Trump was not only
defeated, but he, what he represents and who he represents are removed
from the narrative. Trump would be in jail, the right-wing extremist
MAGA would be on the run and the brown tide would sweep over the lands
that produced this threat to our democracy.

The trouble is the narrative collapsed. It is hard for normal people to
grasp how terrifying it is to the progressive cult that Trump remains
free. They were sure he would be in jail long ago. The fallback to this
was that the party would have excluded him due to the lawfare stuff.
They were all sure this was inevitable. Like the people running a
failing company, they could not bring themselves to see that their
schemes were not working, so they just kept pretending they were
working.

This explains the unprecedented gaslighting campaign for Harris. Given
the choice of accepting reality and creating a fantasy, they have picked
the latter. In this fantasy, the boozy Harris goes from a cackling
simpleton to a dusky version of Daenerys Targaryen from the Game of
Thrones, <a
href="https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55343d516f26d9cb486a9761/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/game-of-thrones-dany-controversial-image.jpg"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">carried</a> by the masses to her place on
the throne. In this version, not only has the wicked orange man finally
defeated, but he is also written out of the story altogether.

The excessively online are downing handfuls of black pills this week, as
they are the most susceptible to media gaslighting, but reality is not
as pliable. The polling in all of the important states has not changed
much over the last month. The
<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">top issues</a> for the voters are all bad
for the regime. It does not help that Harris is sounding like a
tanked-up version of Jimmy Carter, proposing wage and price controls, to
deal with the inflation problem the regime claims have been fixed.

The regime is now setting up a scenario in which Harris and Walz never
take an unscripted question or debate the Trump – Vance ticket. Harris
has dropped out of the first debate schedule for the first week of
September. There is a good chance that they will pull the plug on all
debates and anything that could possibly lead to these two speaking off
the cuff. Like the people running the failing bank, the regime has
landed on a plan they are so sure will work, so they will pretend it is
working.

There is a name for this sort of collective delusion. The Tinker Bell
effect describes the idea that something exists because people believe
in it. In the fairytale, Tinker Bell is brought back to life by the
audience’s belief. This week, the assembled foot soldiers of the
progressive cult and the regime toadies are holding hands, telling each
other that they believe, as one character after another is brought forth
to pretend that the Neverland of the convention is real.

Time will tell if they manage to gaslight this boozy simpleton and her
Elmer Fudd sidekick into the White House. Like a failing bank, Americans
may prefer the happy talk of their rulers to the reality of their lives.
Civilizations in decline often have a series of bizarre rulers at the
end. On the other hand, people may decide that a boozy brown Tinkerbell
is beyond their ability to suspend disbelief. Regardless, reality
remains undefeated, no matter how hard you believe otherwise.
