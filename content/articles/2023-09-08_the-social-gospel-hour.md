I mentioned in a previous episode that I might do a show on the Social
Gospel Movement so I thought it would be a good topic to start the fall
season. When I sat down to put the show together it occurred to me that
there was another way to talk about the topic other than describing the
people and ideas. After all, the only reason to care about this is for
how it still casts a shadow over the present day.

Instead of doing a history type show I went in another direction. One of
things that is striking when you read about the Social Gospel Movement
is just how much of their language is with us today. In the show I point
out that if you remove the references to God and Scripture, these people
would sound like our current scolds. They would be demanding Musk ban me
from Twitter.

That is one point of the show for those who will not listen. The present
lunacy we are experiencing is not due to some bug in the system or the
work of alien outsiders exploiting our kindness. The modern Social
Justice Warrior is a uniquely American thing, the full flowering of part
of the American character. That blue haired crazy at the office is more
American than anyone in the dissident right.

That is not an easy thing for people to accept because it means the
problem is far different from what is comfortable. It means there is no
simple answer. We do not just have to win an election and then ban CRT
in the schools. We do not just have to get back to our constitutional
principles. Those simple answers are not answers, but ways to avoid
looking at the real problem, which is in the mirror.
