There is a Hollywood plot where a troubled ventriloquist either begins
to think his dummy is real or the dummy has actually come to life. The
dummy then begins to direct the ventriloquist to do terrible things like
kill people. Another take on this is where actors in some sort of
fantasy performance get sucked into what appears to be a real life
version of the fantasy world. The underlying premise is that playing
make believe for too long causes one to lose his grasp of reality.

There is some truth to this concern for unreality. Extremely rich or
famous people often cut themselves off from the world. In the case of
the rich guy, it simply becomes a haven from the hassles of the real
world. For the famous person it is the one place they are free of the
fans. Over time they become increasing detached from reality or
overindulge in drugs and alcohol. Howard Hughes is the famous rich guy
example, while Elvis and Michael Jackson are famous people examples.

The French Revolution provides a more general example. The king was
certainly divorced from reality, while clearly not insane. His actions
were rational, based on the rules of the world in which he lived. The
same can be said for the aristocracy that was competing with him for
power. The trouble is that world was separate from the reality of France
at the time. The Ancien Régime was operating in an unreality, based in
rules that were quickly being washed away by events.

Of course, the comparison between this age and that age is common on
this side of the great divide because of the general weirdness of the
managerial class. Normal people, regardless of their income, are
concerned with things like rising prices and the dramatic spike in
violent crime. Meanwhile, the people running for office are telling you
that their penis is imaginary and climate change is our greatest
challenge. “Let them eat cake” sounds reasonable in comparison.

What is not well known or at least not discussed in the history books,
is if the Ancien Régime invested a lot of time in story telling. That
is, did they spend their days spinning tales that confirmed their
version of reality? Were there people responsible for telling the
important people that the peasants were running out of steam and soon
they would fall back in line? Did the official information guy at court
tell everyone that the unrest in the countryside was transitory?

It sounds ridiculous but look around the mass media. So much of what
passes for the news is just a form of wish-casting. The stories,
opinions and analysis are all designed to buck up the ruling class in
the face of disconfirmation. When inflation began to rage, they were
falling all over themselves to preach the gospel of transitory. It was
obviously ridiculous but they wanted to believe it, so everyone in the
managerial class put on the transitory face and explained how it was all
transitory.

The last two years has been an elaborate game of Covid charades. It
seems like a million years ago, but at the start they were claiming the
hospitals were overrun and people were dropping dead in the street. None
of that was true. In fact, the opposite of that was true with regards to
hospitals. We wrecked our medical system because the managerial class
believed the scary stories they were telling one another. In retrospect,
the whole thing was a deadly and expensive farce.

We are seeing a replay of this with the Ukraine. For close to a year the
media has been brewing up one whopper after another about the war. A
batch of fake stories are released about Ukrainian babushkas destroying
Russian tanks with household products and Western capitals erupt in
celebration. According to the storytellers, Russia has been running out
of missiles since February. The whole thing looks like a deranged game
of make believe to console the managerial class.

This is not a new phenomenon. Way back in the Obama years, the Democrats
passed a big spending bill to fund “shovel ready projects.” That was in
the winter and by spring they had all the stuff ready for a big party
called the summer of recovery. They expected to have Obama roam the
countryside, standing in front of construction sites for new bridges
while he talked about his great polices. Their narrative said he would
be the new FDR, along with the new Lincoln and new Jesus.

They were so sure their stories were true they spent tens of millions on
materials for the expected rallies. Things like signs and t-shirts with
the “Summer of Recovery” printed on them in Team Obama colors. They were
using the slogan into the early summer, despite the reality on the
ground. It was as if they thought they could will their preferred
version of reality into existence if they just pretended it was
happening. The script said it would happen, so it was going to happen.

This has been the pattern for a long time now. Someone in the managerial
class creates a pleasing narrative. It catches on and before long
everyone is repeating the pleasing narrative in public. Experts are
brought in to explain why this pleasing narrative is realty and then
other experts are brought in to present proof. It is as if they think
that once everyone agrees that the pleasing narrative is reality, then
reality has no choice but to submit to the new moral consensus.

Again, Ukraine provides examples. A month ago, the Ukrainians launched a
series of counter offensives. The mass media was instantly full of
stories about how the Russian army was collapsing and the Ukrainians
would soon be in Moscow. Retired generals were brought in to confirm the
story. Analysts with funny names wrote columns about how the war has
turned decisively against Russia. Everyone was sure it had to be true
because they believed it was true.

Getting back to that old Hollywood plot, the managerial class seems to
be in a pattern where they create a fantasy and then the fantasy
convinces them it is real. Like the ventriloquist who believes his dummy
has come to life, the narrative makers seem to be sure their alternative
reality is more real than reality. They have come to believe that a good
narrative is something like an incantation. If it is repeated enough,
the narrative bends reality to fit the plot line of the narrative.

The assumption is that the endless telling of whoppers is to shape
public opinion, but that is just a story normal people want to believe.
No one in charge gives a tinker’s damn what the people think about
anything. There is no evidence that public opinion has any impact on
public policy. After the next election, all of those new faces in office
will melt away revealing the same old faces behind them. Public opinion
will have changed nothing about Washington.

A better reason for the explosion of narrative realty in the managerial
class is that this is how the managerial elite controls the system. The
people with complicated titles and inscrutable qualifications control
the vast leviathan that is the modern managerial state using tales of
what lies just over the horizon. The millions in the system, like ants
in a colony, response and act accordingly. The leviathan moves in the
desired direction with the help of a million administrative hands.
