My guess is John Derbyshire and Ethnark from FTN are the only two people
to catch the meaning of the show title this week. It came to me while
reading some of the comments to my post earlier in the week on the
wealth tax. It reminded me that dissident politics is a much more
radical venture than previous opposition movements in that it requires
an entirely new moral framework. It is not just about getting some
things in the law changed or better behavior from the people in power.
It is a cultural revolution.

At least it aspires to be one. Failure is always an option, particularly
when it comes to social movements. The people in charge could start
sweeping up bad thinkers and sending us off to camps. For now, though,
it is about discrediting a lot of old ideas about how we relate to one
another, society, and our government. That is not an easy thing as all
of us have grown up marinated in the morality of the Left, along with
the moral scolding of the so-called Right. Civic nationalism and
Progressive morality are all we know.

What I decided to do is focus this week on various old ideas, customs,
habits and so forth that no longer fit the present age, it is not a
one-hour show detailing a new moral philosophy, but a show picking apart
the old habits of mind. I am most certainly going to be writing about
some of these topics in the future, as I think topics like tax policy
offer a great way to question (and disrupt!) the old modes of thought.
Sadly, I was not able to work in the phrase “invisibilize the
unmentionables” this week. Maybe next week.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I have been
de-platformed by Spotify, because they feared I was poisoning the minds
of their Millennial customers.
