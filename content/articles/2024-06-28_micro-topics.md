The show was assembled before the debate, which is a good thing because
I would never have been to record anything after watching that lunacy. I
think I may have blown a funny fuse laughing at it. The only thing Biden
did not do last night was drop his pants and then wander off the stage.
It did not top the John Fetterman performance, but it was still a
ridiculous and embarrassing spectacle.

Frankly, I felt shame watching it, so I turned it off after thirty
minutes. I do not care if Joe Biden is a monster who is run by monsters.
It goes against my code as a man to enjoy the suffering of others in
this way. He is an old man who should be waiting for the sweet relief of
death right now, not paraded around like this. The people humiliating
this man by parading him around should be shot.

That said, the game is afoot. There is simply no way they can let him
continue, so they have to find a replacement before the convention. That
first means either having the talk with him that many people have to
have with an old person in their life. If that fails, then it means
invoking the 25th Amendment and having him removed or maybe finding some
loophole in the party rules to remove him from the ticket.

The sad spectacle should disabuse everyone about who really runs things.
There is simply no way this shuffling husk of man is making any
decisions. In this regard, Biden has become the epitome of neocon
dominance. They found the ultimate puppet to execute their devious plot
to bring the world to the brink of disaster. Maybe it is time to address
that problem while addressing the Biden problem.
