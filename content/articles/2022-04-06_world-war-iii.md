The war that the Global American Empire has launched against Russia is
just the beginning of a global war it believes will bring about the end
times. That sounds extreme but the top foreign policy people of the
regime are quietly talking about regime change in both Moscow and
Beijing. The main focus right now is Moscow, but they also have Beijing
in their crosshairs and maybe even New Delhi. They believe the war is
the final phase of the end of history.

This sounds insane given that Russia has more than enough nuclear
weapons to reduce the empire to dust. Despite this reality, the people
in charge of the empire have the current figurehead demanding Putin be
arrested for war crimes. This is a new reality that needs to be
acknowledged. Joe Biden is not in charge of anything. That was made
clear when Barak Obama visited the White House recently. Biden was
completely ignored by everyone, including Obama.

Putting that aside, the Global American Empire seems to have determined
that the next war to end all wars and usher in the end times will be a
financial one. Their response to Russian defensive measures in the
Ukraine have revealed this thinking. The Ukrainians have been begging
for air cover, heavy weapons and even troops. What Washington has
organized for them is a series of Twitter campaigns intended to cancel
Putin and all Russians, along with an organized economic war against
Russia.

In a way, Ukraine is the proof of concept for the empire. They are fully
committed to an economic war with Russia that transcends Ukraine. What
happens a month from now when the war is over? The Russians will destroy
the Ukrainian army in the east and that will force a deal. Either
Zelensky is killed by his own people or he flees. The alternative is
Russia simply partitions Ukraine along ethnic lines and imposes the deal
on Ukraine that matches what has been proposed.

Will these sanctions last forever? Will the West simply acknowledge
reality and strike a deal with the Russians? It seems pretty clear that
Washington will not allow Zelensky to make a deal with Russia, so what
happens when the Ukrainians get tired of dying and kill Zelensky
instead? Will his replacement be recognized? These simple questions make
clear that this war Washington has launched against Moscow goes well
beyond the events in Ukraine. It is a war of conquest.

There is another
<a href="https://americanmind.org/salvo/the-gathering-typhoon/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">front</a> in this war. Beijing correctly
understands that they are also in Washington’s death pool. This is why
they have backed Moscow and why they will probably look to join the
fight sooner rather than later. The reason for that is they know the
empire cannot win a two front war. Slapping sanctions on Russia will
impoverish the imperial subjects in Europe, but not those in North
America. A trade war with China, on the other hand, will hit Americans
very hard.

China also has the long term objective of capturing Taiwan, which will
open the way for China to being the dominant power in the region. Look
at a map and it is clear that Taiwan is the Malta of the China Sea.
Whoever controls it controls access to the Pacific and control of the
sea lanes to Asia. As long as the Global American Empire controls
Taiwan, China is a landlocked power walled off from the sea by countries
financially and militarily tied to the American empire.

There are some questions that are unanswered at the moment. One of them
is whether China would prefer a shooting war with America or an economic
one. If it is the former then the only way to do that is to make a hard
play for Taiwan. That would start with blocking access to the Taiwan
Straits. This would force the United States to send the navy to open the
straights, which would expose those ships to attack. This would give
both sides reason to organize for war over Taiwan.

If it is an economic war, then the logical play is to openly and
aggressively defy the sanctions regime on Russia. This would lead to
sanctions from Washington, which would be answered with sanctions from
Beijing. The Chinese could pick a range of strategically important
products to withhold from the West. This would have a real impact on the
imperial subjects living in North America. Imagine a shortage of
clothing and vehicle tires or a shortage of car parts.

There are good arguments for both scenarios, but no one seems to know
how China sees this war unfolding. They have certainly studied it. Back
in 2013 the Pentagon learned that the Chinese have been <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">studying</a> the relative human capital
between China and the GAE. To their shock and horror, they learned that
the Chinese do not think diversity is our strength. The Chinese have
also been <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">studying</a> Pearl Harbor, which suggests
they are thinking about a shooting war as well.

China is not the only other front in this burgeoning global economic
war. India has been hostile to the empire since the war on Russia
started. Saudi Arabia has also been unpleasant about the sanctions
regime. Most likely the pending Iran deal has been scuttled to keep
Riyadh from changing teams. Then you have the global south, which will
suffer first in this war. How the West keeps them from moving north *en
masse* is a question no one seems to ask.

What Washington has done is organize the West for a global economic war
against the rest of the world. It is a conflict of visions. China and
Russia imagine a multipolar world while Washington demands a unipolar
world. This conflict began and will end around the global economic
arrangements. Of course, economic disputes often lead to military
disputes, so that is always on the table. No one knows if Washington has
thought this through, but we do know who will pay the price.
