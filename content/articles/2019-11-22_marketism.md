Last summer, I was asked to do a presentation to an industry group on
the topic of technology and small business in America. The question was
how can small and mid-sized business compete with and cooperate with the
tech giants. I suspect they expected a dozy talk on how best to use
LinkedIn and Facebook to attract new clients, but instead I gave a
speech on how these companies need to be destroyed. If we are to avoid
techno-feudalism, Silicon Valley must be wiped from the earth.

The funny thing I noticed is the older more right-wing people were
uncomfortable with this sort of talk, even if the facts made sense to
them. The older left-wing types were taken back by such talk. The Left
in America is fully incorporated now, an extension of the human resource
and training departments of global capital. The most receptive to what I
was saying were the younger people. They asked a lot of good questions,
suggesting they have been wrestling with this reality as well.

Last weekend, I was at an AIM meet-up. Jared Taylor, James Kirkpatrick
(<a href="https://arktos.com/product/conservatism-inc/"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">buy his book</a>) and Patrick
Casey were there as well. Jared gave a talk on the dangers of picking
the wrong enemies. One of the wrong enemies, according to Jared, was
capitalism. He gave a fiery defense of market capitalism. One of the
things I noticed is that the young guys were not really buying it.
Everyone loves and respects Jared, so they were polite and respectful,
but I could not help but notice the skepticism.

Now, Jared is a man of his time. He remembers the 1970’s and he
remembers living in Japan as the country turned the corner from post-war
depression to economic powerhouse in the 1980’s. Young people inherited
the product of market economics, so they take it for granted. At the
same time though, they inherited the consequences of marketism. The
broken homes, the busted communities, the sterile suburbs, young women
throwing their lives away on feminism. That’s their frame of reference.

I thought it would make a good topic to cover in the podcast this week,
especially as we head into the holy season of marketism. It is one of
those topics that I think is useful in reintroducing the types of topics
that must be the focus of any cultural movement. One consequence of
marketism is that those naturally inclined to right-wing politics are no
longer comfortable speaking about culture. Instead, everything is framed
in the sterile terms of market capitalism. We’ve lost the cultural
language.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
