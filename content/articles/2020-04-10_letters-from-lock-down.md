It used to be that Good Friday was my first non-office day of the year.
By that I mean it was the first non-work day of the year. It was the
first break since the holidays. I’d rent a skiff and go fishing, waiting
for a passing knight to heel me. Some years I’d go to the range or,
depending upon the weather, I’d go for a ride. When I still went to
mass, I’d go to the evening service, but I have not done that in years.

In the lock down, the normal routine no longer holds. Like everyone else
I have been sheltering in place the last several weeks. Fishing is
banned here now. The ranges are all closed. I can still go outside for a
ride, as they are not arresting people for being outside without a hall
pass. They are arresting people for
<a href="https://archive.is/rUhyQ" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">violating social distancing rules</a>, so that means
I’ll need to avoid people while out and about today.

For the first couple of weeks of the lock down I tried to maintain my
normal schedule, as much as possible, but that did not really work. It
was like a vacation in which I was not allowed to have any fun. That and
client work started to slow up as they shifted from going into lock down
to adjusting for the coming depression. This week my work was probably
the slowest in a decade, not counting real vacations.

As a result, I capitulated to reality and decided to use the time to
take care of some small projects, like catching up with the
correspondence. Like the comment section, the in-box has been hopping
during the great panic. It really bugs me when I fall behind in replying
to readers and listeners, but there are only so many hours in a day. It
is just one of those things I have had to accept as a part of doing this
thing.

I also decided to upgrade the computer I use for recording each week.
The hard drive was getting full, so that meant installing a new drive
and reloading all the program I use for various things. I was still on
Windows 8, so it was long overdue for an upgrade, but it is a huge
hassle that I really hate. Strangely, the microphone I use is much more
sensitive in the new system, so the sound this week may be a little off.

All-in-all, I’m growing weary of the lock down. I’m thinking about
breaking contain and going back to the office next week. I have several
“letters of transit” now from clients that declare I am an essential
person. Even though the building is technically closed, I have keys and
the utilities are still on, I think. Perhaps I can be an example to
others and this madness will come to an end sooner rather than later.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
