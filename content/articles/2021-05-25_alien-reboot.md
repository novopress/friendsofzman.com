------------------------------------------------------------------------

For reasons no one has bothered to explain, the government went on a
strange public relations tour, informing us that it has for years been
documenting unidentified objects in the air and sea. These events have
been captured by cameras mounted on military ships and aircraft. They
released a bunch of these videos, some of which had audio of the people
recording them. Those voices in the videos tell the viewer that the
cameramen are baffled by the blurry images they are seeing.

Along with the videos, the Pentagon provided some background. They claim
they have data going back a long time suggesting these events are not
illusions. For example, they claim the appearance of unidentified flying
objects near a nuclear weapons battery caused the facility to shut down.
They did not state it directly, but the implication is the entity behind
the unexplained objects was also able to turn off the nuclear weapons
facility or at least disable it while they were flying around it.

Despite the comically bad video that was released, the claim is that
these objects, in the air and the sea, operate in ways thought
impossible. They move faster than any human built craft and they
maneuver well beyond our capability. In one case, an object was claimed
to have been in the air then it went into the sea, moving at speeds well
beyond any known seagoing vessel. The video for that one shows what
looks like a piece of fuzz moving around on a grainy black and white
video.

Supposedly the government is releasing this stuff because Congress
passed a law requiring them to come clean on the UFO question. Marco
Rubio, one of the Senate’s most brilliant thinkers, got something passed
last year that requires the Pentagon to issue a report to the public on
what they know. Presumably, these videos are part of prepping the public
for whatever the official word is on UFO’s. Who knows, maybe they will
roll out a little green man along with the report.

Of course, the right way to view this is with lots of skepticism. After
all, the people putting this into the public domain lie to us every day.
They were sure that invisible Russians using mind control somehow
altered the 2016 election. Amazingly, those invisible Russians were able
to do their dastardly deeds without ever having been caught on camera,
so maybe the space aliens flying around US navy ships could learn a few
things from the those invisible Russian <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentats</a>.

Then we have the evidence itself. Maybe the military really is using
1970’s technology on ships and aircraft, but those videos look
suspiciously primitive. The only thing missing was Mulder and Scully
from the old X-Files series. If Rod Sterling were narrating the video,
it would have made more sense. Again, given the government’s compulsive
lying, the voice overs were less than convincing. If this is all they
have, then we have to assume this is just more bravo sierra from the
state.

The biggest problem with all UFO claims is that we know
<a href="https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=9885" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">some things</a> that would have to be true about alien
visitors. One is they would have to be orders of magnitude smarter than
humans in order to master interstellar travel. We are not even sure we
can return to the moon, much less travel the stars. This super smart
species that has conquered what we currently think is impossible, that
is travel beyond light speed, would surely have figured out how to evade
our primitive cameras.

The claim about the nuclear missile facility is the most amusing example
of the paradoxes in the UFO story. We are told they were able to detect
these entities on radar, but the entities seem to have disabled the
nuclear weapons. That means these super intelligent space aliens can
shut down our most advanced weapons from their ships but could not
figure out how to shut off the radar and cameras. It is a good thing
they did not come here to rob bank vaults.

Despite the outlandishness of these whoppers, it fits a familiar pattern
for how the state disseminates bogus information. Andrew Anglin pointed
this out in his [Unz Review
piece](https://www.unz.com/article/the-pentagon-is-behind-the-fake-alien-agenda/)
on the UFO story. He wrote, “Journalists and people who claim to be
journalists regularly come up with things that seem plausible or likely,
then claim that they have an insider source”. Those sources are
imaginary, or they are the government contact that is dictating the fake
news item to the “journalist”.

The question, of course, is why are they putting this nonsense out into
the public domain after years denying any of it was real? There are
plenty of theories ranging from the mundane to the conspiratorial. One
possible answer is that these people are compulsive liars who just like
lying. Generations of selection pressure in favor of sociopaths have
resulted in a ruling class full of them. They think it is funny to mess
with the rubes in flyover country and this just another gag.

The good news is that the public seems to be more than a bit skeptical
about these new UFO claims. The story did not get much traction and the
commentary on it from independent sources has been mostly negative. The
American public may have reached the point where they view all official
stories as just new productions from the same theater group. The new
real-time X-Files is like the latest Star Wars offering, in that the
public has seen enough. The thrill is gone.
