One of the great unnoticed things about the current crisis is that the
rules that everyone said were inviolable no longer seem to apply. This
is most obvious in the economic realm where nothing makes any sense.
Things that were said to be impossible a generation ago are now the
default. Similarly, politics is now operating by a set of rules that no
one can explain. Things that were considered outside of the realm of the
possible are the new normal.

Way back in the before times, when Covid got going, the world literally
shut itself down in response to the virus. In America, over twenty-five
million people were laid off and tens of millions more were sent home to
work. The official unemployment rate peaked at thirteen percent and was
then restated to be just under seven percent. What the actual
unemployment rate was at the peak is unknown. Regardless, it was an
unprecedented attack on the economy that should have been devastating.

According to official statistics, the economy shrugged it off. The
official figures say the economy contracted by 3.4% in 2020 but all of
the decline was contained in the third quarter of the year. The fourth
quarter began a massive rebound. The official numbers say the economy
grew by 5.7% in 2021. That more than made up for the decline in the
prior year due to Covid. It turns out you can literally shut down an
economy and nothing serious will happen. No wonder people want to stay
home.

It is not just in America where the laws of economics have been
suspended. In Europe they are allegedly facing an energy shortage. Since
forever we have been told that steep increases in energy prices trigger
recession. Germany is literally facing the prospect of having no gas and
no one seems to notice. The massive disruptions to the flow of energy
into the EU has thus done little to upset the economy. According to the
old rules, this should not be possible.

It is possible that the media is simply lying to us. Maybe people are
seething at the suffering that has been inflicted upon them. The
official media, controlled as it is by state actors, is ignoring this in
favor of happy talk. It could also mean that all of those economic rules
were just made up. No on really knows why the economy does what it does
but like court magicians, economist pretend to know in order to provide
authority to the ruling class. The whole thing is a put-on.

It is also possible that we live in a simulation. What we think of as
reality is just a bit of software that the creators can tweak as they
please. Those old rules had to be abandoned because the system got a
computer virus. In order to keep the simulation from crashing entirely
they changed the code. It is a temporary patch to the system until the
next upgrade. Maybe that is why big events from the past, like the
lockdowns, suddenly feel like distant memories. We rebooted.

Politics has the same weirdness. Everyone reading this is absolutely
certain that we did not arrest people for speech. That was written down
somewhere and everyone agreed that you could say what you like with some
very narrow limits. Yet Douglas Mackey faces a decade in jail for making
fun of Hillary Clinton on Twitter. Maybe like the economic rules, there
was a patch done to the software, a hard reboot and we are suddenly
operating under a totally new set of rules.

This confusion is obvious with the political actors. Salman Rushdie was
stabbed on stage in New Jersey. All of a sudden, the people dedicating
their lives to suppressing speech were bemoaning this attack on free
speech. In Britain, Boris Johnson has people thrown in dungeons for
using the wrong pronouns, but he was out there decrying this attack on
our sacred liberty. Maybe the software engineers forgot the update these
guy’s code during the last service pack.

Even taking a step back and looking at things in the most general sense,
the rules no longer seem to apply. Politics used to be defined by the
three big human motivations, money, power and sex. How does drag queen
story hour fit in here? Who is benefitting from this lunacy? The point
of this assault on the children seems to be the promotion of general
mayhem, which used to be the opposite of what rulers sought. The old
rules said order was the goal of the people in charge.

Of course, we know that a tenet of the new religion states that only
through mass confusion can we transcend this world. They believe if they
get everyone into a state of agitation that we somehow break free from
our old thinking. This lets us adopt a new model of thinking which is
the passage to the glorious future. The endless “subverting
expectations” is a deliberate effort to make everyone crazy. It is hard
to accept, but this does explain why the rulers now prefer chaos.

That does not explain why the system trundles on, despite violating all
of the rules we have been told are inviolable. We have double-digit
inflation, periodic food shortages and record high gas prices. The
whiplash effect is now emerging, where price hikes are followed by
demand destruction, which collapses prices, only to see demand return
and drive prices back up again. In other words, we are seeing
stagflation in the economy but no one seems to notice or care all that
much.

Reality is that thing that does not go away when you stop believing it.
Maybe it takes us a while to recognize reality after a long absence.
Perhaps what lies ahead is a mass recognition of reality and a sudden
return of the old rules. Maybe the people running the simulation get
bored and shut us down. At this point, given the general weirdness we
are seeing, we cannot safely assume anything. For now, at least, we are
in a new world with new rules and a new sense of reality.
