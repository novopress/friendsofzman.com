On this side of the great divide there has been a lot of discussion
about the role of altruism in the current crisis. Altruism run-amok is
often blamed for things like open borders and the so-called woke
subculture. Something went haywire in Western people in the last
century, and we now care more about total strangers than we care about
our closest relatives. Altruism is killing the West.

The trouble with this is there is no answer as to why. Why did Western
people suddenly go bonkers in this way? Perhaps the answer lies in the
idea of moral preferences, the decision-making process we use to choose
the right thing, or the wrong thing, in the many small transactions of
life. Human societies are moral societies, so we are trained up into a
framework that guides our moral choices in life.

Perhaps somewhere in the last century that mechanism has been hijacked
in such a way that it is immoral to think we have preferences at all.
Note that everyone seems to be compelled to justify even the smallest
choices. If you say you do not like onions on your burger you are
expected to say something about onions being one of the least popular
condiments for burgers.

In other words, you cannot have preferences just because you are a human
being with free will and the right to choose. You must always justify
your preferences against some standard that exists outside your personal
preferences. In the case of immigration, you must justify any opposition
to it in economic or security terms. You cannot simply say “I do not
want this” and leave it at that.

That is the show this week. I use the topic of immigration to talk about
why we have to justify our preferences when there is no reason we
should. I also finish off with an explanation for why any immigration is
immoral by default. The narrow exceptions are so narrow that they are
not worth considering. The people who want immigration, therefore, must
confront the immorality of immigration.
