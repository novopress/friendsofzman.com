**Note:** I am taking the long weekend to get started on some projects,
so no show today and no posting either. Instead, here is something from
behind the green door that people suggested I post here at some point.
That point is now. Please consider signing up for a green door account.
Five bucks a month is a bargain.

Flipping around YouTube I saw some videos on what I assumed to be the
latest abomination in the *Star Trek* franchise. Having grown up
watching the re-runs of the original, I try not to think about what they
did to it. Lots of men like me ended up in the STEM world because of
science fiction. Not all of it was art. In fact, most of it was crap,
but it made being smart cool and adventurous.

That was the real hook for the kids of my day. The original *Star Trek*
was a pirate ship in space where the crew got to do cool stuff with
technology. The crew were not just swashbucklers, but problem solvers
who often had to use their wits to get out of a jam of their own making.
More than a few trips were made to the emergency room because boys
decided to replicate what Kirk did to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_(Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">defeat</a> the Gorn.

Then I saw that the Drinker had a review or preview about whatever they
were doing with *Star Trek*, so I gave it a listen. Turns out it is not
a new film or series, but
a <a href="https://roddenberry.x.io/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">short</a> that is something of a farewell for William
Shatner. In less than ten minutes it covers the life of the character he
created for the series. There is no dialogue, just computer enhanced
images and a soundtrack.

It is a poignant and beautiful farewell to the man who played the role,
but also the characters and the series that made the franchise possible.
It a short goodbye to a long career and the relationship with the fans.
It is exceedingly rare for Hollywood to do anything with dignity and
class these days, but this is as close as you get to an honorable death
in the entertainment business.

It is ironic, in a way, that Shatner would go out with such class, given
that he is an old school carny in many ways. He was known for a
willingness to take any role that paid, no matter how ridiculous. His
run as TJ Hooker in a television cop show was a long running joke
because it was so silly. Shatner was an anything for a buck sort of guy,
which often meant taking less than dignified jobs.

On the other hand, it is these sorts of carnies who tend to be the most
grateful for and humble about their success. They treat their job as a
profession. Michael Cain and Clint Eastwood are other examples. Their
job, as they saw it, was to make entertainment product for paying
customers. These are the types who avoid politics and just shut up and
sing, so to speak.

Maybe that is why Shatner could be part of this poignant goodbye. He is
93 and his health is not good. This is the final role of his career, so
he could put what he has left in the tank into it. How much he was able
to do is unknown, but the mere fact that he was willing to do it speaks
well of him. He respects the role he played, because he respects the
audience that made his life possible.

As far as the film itself, it brought back many memories of sitting on
the living room floor after school watching the crew of the Enterprise
explore the world. It also reminded me of the wonderful scene in *The
Wrath of Khan* where Spock dies and utters the famous line to his old
friend Kirk, ““I have been – and always shall be – your friend.” In the
theater when I saw it, you could hear a pin drop.

That was the beauty of the original series, something I came to
appreciate as I got older, and that is it was a show about a group of
men, adventuring through life, not as solo acts but as part of a
brotherhood. If you are lucky as a man, you go on your journey with a
group of mates, losing and adding some along the way. The ones you lose
will be waiting for you on the other side. The ones you add will carry
you there.

That is another lesson of the original series. In my life the people who
have given me the business for liking the series have always turned out
to be people wearing a red shirt, the people who could never get the
previous paragraph. Life is for living, which means taking risks. What
makes it sweet is doing so with your crew. A man lives and dies inside
his *\*kóryos* or he never lives at all.

Another thing that came to mind watching this short was that no one
under the age of fifty will get any of it. If you are a millennial, the
original series had been supplanted by the sterile nothingness of *The
Next Generation*, which replaced the pirate-ship-in-space concept with
the corporate division in space idea. Then came the HR department in
space and then the remote field office in space.

More important, the concepts of brotherhood and the noble male life had
pretty much disappeared from the culture. Even in my youth these ideas
were being mocked by buddy comedies and the action hero. Mel Gibson was
a lot of fun in *Lethal Weapon*, but by normal cultural standards, his
character was a loser. The same was true for all the action heroes, who
were solitary figures unable to be part of the Männerbund.

Therein lies some flickers of good news. At the AmRen conference I saw
groups of young guys, which is not so common. Going to a conference to
hear old men moan about the state of the world is not much of an
adventure, but it is a start. There are groups like the Old Glory Club
forming up for young guys to join. They may not have had these concepts
fed to them as children, but the seeds are still there.

That may be why a relatively unsuccessful television series has cast
such a long shadow, despite Hollywood trying to kill it. It is based on
eternal truths about the human condition and the male role in life. No
amount of cultural vandalism can plow under these truths to the point
where they cannot grow again. Those who recall the old truths may be in
their winter, but spring will come again.
