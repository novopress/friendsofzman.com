One of the eternal truths of human society is that the people with real
power are those with control of the economics of society. Whether the
society is ruled by a king or a committee of girl bosses, the people who
have the final say on all matters are those who control the wealth of
society. The golden rule of human organization is “the man with the gold
makes the rules.” Without much fanfare, we may have seen this rule work
its magic in the big neocon funding bill.

The first thing to note about the money for Project Ukraine is most of
the money will never turn up in Ukraine, at least not in the form of
weapons. If you read the <a
href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8035/text"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">text</a> of the bill most of the money is
for slush funds the White House can use to replenish weapons taken off
the shelf and sent to Ukraine over the last year. It appears the White
House has been shipping weapons to Ukraine that were not paid for by
Congress, so this created a debt to the Pentagon budget that is now
repaid.

The number of actual weapons going to Ukraine as a result of this bill
is a fraction of the sixty billion allocated. Ukraine needs advanced air
defense systems, artillery tubes and artillery shells, but none of this
is coming from Washington. The main reason for this is none of these
things exist, at least not in surplus quantities. You cannot send what
does not exist, even with billions to spend. Instead, Ukraine is getting
what is available which is wheeled vehicles and surplus arms.

It is not all that clear that supplying Ukraine with what they need
would make much of a difference, as Ukraine has another problem. The
Ukraine army is running out of men and there is no money solution to
this problem. It takes time to draft and train men to fight this sort of
war. According to Ukraine sources, they need two hundred thousand men
right now to be made whole. That deficit grows bigger by about a
thousand men a day and there is no way to solve this problem.

The reality on the battlefield raises an important question. If there is
no money solution to the problems facing Ukraine on the battlefield,
then why spend sixty billion on this project when it must inevitably
fail? That money could be used to other foreign policy adventures like
the planned war with China over Taiwan. Of course, they could spend the
money on Israel. There is always an appetite for that in Washington.
Instead, they chose to shovel sixty billion into the Ukraine furnace.

The first clue is all the money allocated to the Pentagon for various
undefined things supposedly related to Ukraine. It is clear the
administration sent far more to Project Ukraine than Congress
authorized. What most likely happened is something like the old
arms-for-hostages game played in the Reagan years. Military contractors
sent men and material to Ukraine on the promise they would be made whole
with interest at some point in the future. The future arrived in that
bill.

The other clue is the money being sent to Ukraine for economic support.
It is so tangled up in the language of government that it would take
years for an outsider to figure out what any of it means. This is how
Washington launders trillions of dollars through and for friends of
Washington. Billions will go into obscure programs administered by the
administrative state and then those funds will end up in grants to NGO’s
or contracts to vendors with obscure business models.

Of course, some will go to the Ukraine government, but with very
specific instructions on how it is to be spent. There are many friends
of Washington that have unpaid bills for services rendered to Ukraine.
The vendors must be paid in dollars, not the worthless currency of
Ukraine. Some of this money will be directed through Kiev to those
friends of Washington. It would be a total coincidence if those vendors
just happened to employ friends and family of important people in
Congress.

Most likely this was the main reason for the sense of urgency. Over the
last two years big players have been making deals with Ukraine for
economic development, on the assurance that Ukraine would win the war.
BlackRock, for example, made a number of deals with Kiev. BlackRock and
JP Morgan have created a <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/ukraine-reconstruction-bank-guided-by-blackrock-jpmorgan-ready-action-this-year-2024-01-16/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">bank</a> for rebuilding Ukraine, by which
they mean looting Ukraine. Large global operators have been cutting
deals with Ukraine since the start of the war.

What this means is heavy weight players have been given exclusive access
to Ukraine in exchange for economic assistance now. Much like how the
Pentagon “borrowed” from military contractors, the regime has been
promising the usual suspects first rights to loot Ukraine after the war,
in exchange for “investments” now. This is all done informally, but no
one is hiding it. War has always been good for business, especially the
banking business.

In other words, another purpose of this bill was to repay economic
elites who had been talked into going along with the project. Keep in
mind that players like BlackRock and JP Morgan have money in Russia as
well. Now that it is clear that Ukraine will lose the war, they need to
think about how the world looks after Project Ukraine. As you always see
with a failing enterprise, the insiders are getting their money out
before it becomes obvious to everyone that the enterprise is doomed.

This is all speculation based on the available data, but the facts on
the ground are making it clear to everyone that Ukraine is finished. The
text of this spending bill and the announced weapons transfers that are
part of it all point to a rush for the exits rather than a new
commitment to the project. The smart money just jumped out the window,
carrying your tax dollars with them. That means the next phase is
finding someone in Washington to blame for the failure of the
enterprise.
