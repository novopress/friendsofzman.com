Catching up with the correspondence this week, I have to say that the
questions made for a good show. I’m not the best judge of these things,
but it feels like a good mix of topics to me. I don’t use every question
that comes in, as many only require a quick reply, while others are
outside my area of interest. One of the first steps to wisdom is
confidently saying “I don’t know” when you don’t know something. As I’ve
grown older, I say “I don’t know” a lot more than in the past.

It occurred to me while going through the mail that something seems to
be changing in the audience for dissident content. The topics are
expanding, but also the perspectives on these topics are expanding. It
is easy to get blue about the state of things, but there is an undertow
pulling more and more people in this direction. Many seem to be showing
up without really knowing it. I see this on Gab as well. People are
slowly becoming aware of the changes in society and slowly responding.

That’s what shows up in the correspondence. I wish I had a nickel for
every time I hear some version of “I just started listening/reading you
and …” It could just be a coincidence and maybe I’m suffering from
confirmation bias, but I sense that the tides are flowing in our
direction. At the minimum, the instinct to signal against dissidents is
now waning, as the radicalism of our rulers is on full display.
Suddenly, dissidents are the reasonable voice in the room.

I’ve also noticed an increase in the number of e-mails from college
domains. Some are students, probably most, but some are staffers too. I
think the groyper rebellion on the college campus probably has a lot to
do with it. As young people are re-normalized they are thirsty for
content aimed at normal white people. They turn up on Gab or find their
way here via search results. Both Counter-Currents and AmRen are seeing
a steady increase in their traffic, in spite of the censorship.

Now, the black pillers can take solace in the fact that the people in
charge are increasingly deranged and still in charge. This apparent good
news should not lighten your mood and diminish your melancholy. We
remain a subject people, ruled by deranged fanatics, who want us dead.
For dissidents, it is vital to always think like an underdog, even when
things are going your way. The time to come out of the shadows is when
that which casts the shadows is destroyed.

Another thing I’ve noticed is the number of e-mails related to current
events has dropped considerably over the last year. I went through the
whole backlog this week and not a single mention of Trump, impeachment
or any of it. That is encouraging, as it means our side is disengaging
from that stuff. That suggests our side is truly on the other side of
the divide now. Fewer people are standing on the shore, looking over to
the other side, hoping for acknowledgement.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below.
