The mostly online wars over what has come to be called “woke culture”
obscures a reality that lies behind the fads and programs. That reality
is an ideology that evolved in the last century and now defines the
ruling class of America in a way that the people in the ruling class do
not understand. It is just an assumed part of the culture they were
selected into and conditioned to accept. They believe what they believe
because everyone they know believes it.

That ideology begins with egalitarianism that has its roots in
Protestantism and eventually gave birth to the progressive movement. The
claim that all men are equal in the eyes of God became simply all men
are equal once God was dropped from the thinking of the ruling elites.
Since all men are obviously not equal, the blank slate evolved as a
solution to this dilemma. The inequality we see is the result of
society, so the great and the good have a duty to fix it.

What many now call the civil rights revolution is the most recent and
damaging manifestation of this urge to level society. In his <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Got-Our-Antiracist-Constitution/dp/B0C9FXZZDG/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">pamphlet</a> on the landmark Supreme
Court decision, *Brown versus Board of Education*, professor Jesse
Merriam explained how this case revolutionized the law by transforming
the Constitution from a rights based political system to a civil rights
political system. What is now called antiracism is actually the point of
our political order.

This <a
href="https://tomklingenstein.com/the-rise-of-the-civil-rights-constitution/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">interview</a> with Merriam is interesting
for a number of reasons. One is the exchange he had with the interviewer
over the case of an Alabama eatery that had separate seating for whites
and blacks. The interviewer tries hard to get Merriam to say the
restaurant should be allowed to set its own policies, even if these
policies violate what is, in reality, the ruling dogma of this age. It
is a long game of verbal chess as Merriam deftly avoids the trap set for
him by the interviewer.

That exchange is a good example of the prevailing orthodoxy at work. The
interviewer, most likely without thinking about it, tries to get the
interviewee to say he would tolerate discrimination, which is the chief
sin of this age. The interviewee, knowing this, carefully avoids stating
this by refocusing the discussion on the legal dynamics behind the court
case that arose from this situation. Imagine this going on in elite
offices every day and you get a sense for how ideology rules our elites.

The [case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katzenbach_v._McClung) in
question, *Katzenbach *v*. McClung,* is another good example. The
restaurant did business only in Alabama so it should never have been
subjected to the interstate commerce clause and therefore immune from
the new civil rights provisions recently enshrined in federal law. The
court acknowledged this, but then imagined a scenario in which the
restaurant bought goods that at some point originated out of state, so
therefore it was now subject to federal regulation.

What the court did was reason that since the primary evil against which
the Constitution stands is discrimination, it is logically impossible
for any part of the Constitution to stand against overcoming
discrimination. Whatever “the words on the paper” say, as Barak Obama
once put it, they can never be read to oppose what is now assumed to be
the spirit and point of the document. Belief and righteous commitment to
that belief are now the litmus test of the ruling class across all
domains.

We are about to see the flipside of the civil right revolution in the
federal <a
href="https://nypost.com/2024/04/22/opinion/biden-and-the-great-sheetz-shakedown-another-crazy-example-of-social-justice-run-amok/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">case</a> launched against the Sheetz
store chain. The feds are quite open about the fact that they do not
think the store is using race to discriminate. In fact, they are not
even claiming the policy is leading to fewer black employees than what
would happen without the policy against hiring convicts. They simply say
it could happen, because of upstream discrimination in the criminal
justice system and the economy.

This strikes normal people as madness, and it is madness, the madness
that naturally arises from ideology. The ethical model of the world that
arises from the belief that all men are equal must inevitably target
reality as the ultimate obstacle to achieving the promised goal of the
ideology. It is why ideologues always end up in a life and death
struggle with the reality of the human condition. It is also why they
usually kill a lot of people before reality finally defeats them.

It will not be long before the zombies that dominate the late-night
comedy circuit begin to make jokes about Sheetz not hiring blacks. Jon
Stewart is now practicing his funny faces in the mirror to go along with
his new Sheetz material. This provides the social proof needed so that
everyone in the managerial class will adopt this assertion as a part of
their shared reality. No one will think of the lunacy at the heart of it
because there is no benefit to questioning the belief.

This ties back to that exchange between Klingenstein and Merriam over
the choice involving the Alabama restaurant. There was nothing but
danger for Merriam in defending the ancient right of free association.
For Klingenstein, there was nothing but accolades awaiting him for
defending antiracism. The cult of antiracism that arose from
egalitarianism selects for those who are loyal to the cause and weeds
out those who question the logic of the cause or its underlying
assumptions.

This is why we have a ruling class that seems to be at war with not just
the culture and traditions of America but at war with reality itself.
The American ruling elite has evolved to serve the needs of the civil
rights revolution and what Professor Merriam calls the antiracist
constitution. Happening as it has over generations, the people in it are
unable to see that they are operating within an ideological framework.
They believe what they believe because everyone they know believes it.
