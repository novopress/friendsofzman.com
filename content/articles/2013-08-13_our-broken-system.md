rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here is an interesting article</a> on the
tax reform debate that is part of a larger push to pass a big tax reform
bill after the next election. Congress is trying to be serious about
fixing the tax system, rather than just grandstand on it. They may even
be willing to tackle such touchy things as the mortgage interest
deduction, corporate welfare and so forth. The hint that they are
serious is that the Democrats are playing nice on the issue. The truth
of American politics is that nothing gets passed without the blessing of
the Democrats.

Old bulls like Max Baucus on the Democrat side are actively looking for
big ideas to fix the tax system. House Ways and Means Committee chairman
Dave Camp is having his staff draft bills for consideration this fall.
When you have big shots in both parties in both houses working on
something, it usually means there’s been some deal making done to get
past the regular nonsense. When the old bulls are waging their fingers
or carping at one another across party lines, you know it is all
theater, not a serious effort.

It sounds promising until I get to this:

Dullards like Kevin Williamson picked up on this claiming this is why
the public seems to be siding with Edward Snowden over the rulers. It is
a variation of the Old Testament warning from a prophet about how death
is coming because the people have turned away from God. The conservative
version of this is that the gods are angry because we have turned away
from our constitutional principles. It’s circular reasoning. We are
losing our republic because we have abandoned the basics of republic
government. No kidding.

It misses an important point. The people in charge resort to these sorts
of remedies not because they don’t rust the system They do this because
they no longer trust themselves as a ruling class. That’s why they are
employing the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_of_Silence" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Cone of Silence</a>. They know if this stuff gets out,
members will use it against one another. Put another way, they are
afraid to be candid with one another, because they fear their candor
will be turned into a weapon against them in the future. Everyone
assumes everyone else is a liar and a knave.

They also know the army of lobbyists will start pounding the war drums
in order to get their special deal in the final bill. With a man in the
White House willing to sell his daughters into slavery to score
ideological points, no one can trust that there will be an honest debate
or even a discussion if it is held in public. The result is that the
elected representatives of the people have to abandon the fundamentals
of self-government in order to get anything done in Washington. Is there
any wonder they have so little respect for the Constitution?

An essential point that people on our side have to understand is that
constitutions and political ideology are the result, not the cause.
Principles are the rules the winning side imposes after they win. The
constitution was written by the victors of the Revolutionary War and the
post-war squabbling among the elites in the former colonies. The
mercantile class of the North allied with the planter class in the
South, came together to impose a political system on the new country
that worked for them as a ruling elite.
