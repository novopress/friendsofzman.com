In every human organization there are things that are true but for one
reason or another, everyone agrees to ignore them. It may be that these
things are just annoying, like the personal ticks of the boss. In other
cases, they are things that would put the organization at risk if people
tried to address them. Human systems often must ignore things that
contradict the logic of the system.

The American political order as established by the Constitution has
holes that the Framers chose to ignore because they had no choice. The
final results were a compromise between thirteen states that often had
serious conflicts on things, conflicts that could not be reconciled, so
they were ignored. The most obvious one is the issue of slavery that was
resolved at a later date.

The managerial system that is under assault by Trump was made possible
by ignoring things that were essential to its existence. The creation of
executive agencies and who controls them is a good example. For fifty
years everyone in Washington pretended that these agencies were a fourth
branch of government. Trump has stopped pretending and is challenging a
core assumption of managerialism.

That is the show this week. It is yet another way of looking at how we
got to this place and why Trump can do what so-called conservatives had
promised for decades but were never able to do. At the heart of
managerialism was mokita, things everyone knew were true but agreed not
to discuss. Like a body, the truth can only be hidden for long until it
bobs to the surface.
