One of the great tricks of the neoconservatives was to reshape
opposition to radical causes into support for their own radical
projects. In the early days, this allowed normal people to strongly
oppose limits on corporate power, in the name of fighting the communist
threat from the Soviets. Alternatively, working class people could
support the military industrial complex as their patriotic duty. Their
own interests and genuine opposition to the Left was always secondary.

After the Cold War, this game rapidly evolved so that so-called
conservatives supported a massive expansion of government, as well as a
massive expansion of foreign policy entanglements, all in the name of
freedom. Most conservative people assumed the end of the Cold War meant
America could go back to being a normal country again, but those
feelings were quickly channeled into new causes. The old tricksters were
up to their old tricks, turning virtues into vices.

This is why conservatism never conserved anything. In the Reagan years,
the conservatives were too busy fighting the Soviets to roll back the
cultural revolution or clean up the welfare state. In the Bush years
they were too busy spreading freedom and smart bombs to address domestic
concerns. Despite promising to promote conservative causes,
conservatives instead found some war to fight. Meanwhile, the bad guys
got to run riot in the culture.

You can see the same game emerging with the war against Russia. The
deception here is another version of the big lie. This time the villain
is Putin, who for no reason at all, attacked Ukraine. All that
opposition to perverts in sundresses and bigots spewing antiwhite
propaganda in the classroom is being channeled into opposing Putin in
order to defend our democracy. Normal people are supposed to be mad at
Putin rather than the sorry state of their own country and its leaders.

You see how this works in this Victor Davis Hanson <a
href="https://amgreatness.com/2022/10/09/ukraine-and-the-malevolent-legacy-of-the-obama-biden-administration/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a>. The goal of the post is to
divert opposition to the regime’s foreign policy into a Republican brand
of the same policies toward Russia. You see, the reason that dude in a
dress is chasing your daughter around the classroom is Obama was soft on
Russia. Biden is following the same policies, which is why things are so
bad. He uses some form the word “appeasement” nine times, because, you
know.

Of course, the column is also an attempt to whitewash the
neoconservative involvement in the current crisis. You see, it is not
the people who started this war with Russia who are to blame for the
fallout. No, it is some guy off stage who is turned into the Emmanuel
Goldstein of this show. He is the one who set the wheels in motion and
all the people currently running foreign policy, all members of the same
Trotsky cult, coincidentally enough, are just victims like you.

The truth is this war has its roots much further back than Obama. If you
want to point to an incident as a starting place, it would be American
involvement in the Balkan war during the Clinton years. American support
for Kosovo against Serbia was the start of a new conflict with Russia.
At the time, it was viewed in Moscow as a deliberate offense to the
Russians. In the years that followed, this affair has become a warning
for the Russians about what Washington plans for them.

There are other capers that could be a starting point. Washington
supporting Georgia against South Ossetia in the Bush years is a good
example. The neocons wanted to add Georgia to NATO. The Russians made
clear that they saw this as a provocation, as well as another broken
promise. Washington had promised Moscow after the fall of the Soviet
Union that NATO would not expand to the Russian border. In other words,
the neocons have been at this for a long time.

Of course, one does not have to go back that far to see the grimy
fingerprints of the Trotskyites in the current crisis. Victoria Nuland,
who is running Russia policy for Biden, was the person running Ukraine
policy for Obama. She was right there on the ground when Washington
overthrew the Ukrainian government in 2014. She is pals with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ihor_Kolomoyskyi" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Ihor Kolomoyskyi</a>, the Ukrainian oligarch who backed
Zelensky. The point is this is another neocon war that runs against
American interests.

It also needs to be pointed out that Hanson supported all of the neocon
misadventures going back to the Clinton years. He wanted Clinton to take
an even tougher stance in the Balkan conflict. You will note that the
neocons used the same language against Clinton as they are using now
against Biden. He was not tough enough against this new Hitler from the
hinterlands. Hanson, of course, supported the Bush wars. He also <a
href="http://opiniojuris.org/2008/08/24/georgia-south-ossetia-and-abkhazia/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">supported</a> the Georgia – South Ossetia
caper.

The point of Hanson’s post is to make sure no one turns over any of
these rocks with regards to the neocons and Russia policy. Instead, the
game is to channel general opposition to the Biden administration into
an even more deranged hatred of Russia and Vladimir Putin. All your
troubles will go away conservatives, if you just hate the Russians more
and vote harder this November. It is a clever trick that works on a
gullible but trusting population.

This is why foreign policy must become a litmus test. There are no
American interests in the Ukraine, South Ossetia or Tajikistan. Not only
does meddling in these areas invite trouble, but it also diverts
attention from important matters. Building superhighways in Afghanistan
did not shorten a single commute in America. “Standing with Ukraine”
does not stop the flood of invaders over the southern border. What these
foreign adventures do is divert attention from America’s real problems.

Given that all of these foreign escapades over the last thirty years
trace back to the same Trotsky cult, the real litmus test is
neoconservatism. Back before most people were born, they hollowed out
conservatism and have used to as a Trojan horse to trick decent people
into supporting that which is against their interests. A genuine
conservative policy with regards to Russia would oppose Biden for
meddling in the affairs of Russia, not demand more meddling.
