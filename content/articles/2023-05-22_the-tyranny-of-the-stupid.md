In *The Past is a Future Country*, Ed Dutton and J.O.A. Rayner-Hilles,
argue that the West is about to be swamped by an unsustainable wave of
stupid people. This is not the result of immigration, but rather the
culmination of an evolutionary process that began in the Industrial
Revolution. Darwinian selection weakened along with the increase in
living standards. The result is a steady increase in narcissistic stupid
people who undermine the fundamentals of Western society.

In this <a
href="https://vdare.com/articles/the-rayner-effect-why-are-leftist-though-not-conservative-women-politicians-increasingly-so-stupid"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a>, Ed Dutton makes the point that
liberal female politicians are getting dumber, as a result of this
process he outlined in his book. He relies on two examples, Sanna Marin
of Finland and Angela Rayner of Britain, to make his point. Both women
are on what we insist on calling the Left and both women are morons. Not
only are they stupid, but they appear to have come from stupid parents.
They are *Nth* generation morons who have risen to the top of politics.

It is an amusing and satisfying read for people who think of themselves
on the Right, even if he is making sweeping claims from just two
examples. For as long as anyone can recall, the people we call the Left
have claimed that their opponents are unsophisticated morons who should
be dismissed. Having this turned on its head with the use of the human
sciences is good fun, but it may be missing the real cause for the great
dumbing down of Western politics.

The ideal politician in a liberal democracy has an extremely high verbal
dexterity along with an extremely low degree of self-awareness. In fact,
the best politicians of this age are glib narcissists who have never
done anything useful. Much of the panic over Donald Trump is due to the
fact he worked in the dreaded private sector. Having had anything other
than a ceremonial position in the real economy is so strange in politics
that the political class naturally views it as a defect.

The reason for this is despite the fact we insist on calling it
politics, there is little in the way of politics happening in a modern
liberal democracy. Everyone in the political system agrees on the moral
claims. As Marx noted, when you get the morality settled, there is no
need for politics. Put another way, once everyone agrees on the goal,
then you are left with a debate about how best to achieve it. The
barrier to entry in modern politics is the moral questions.

As a result, the selection pressure in politics is for people who will
never color outside the lines and always promote the latest thing. The
more natural someone is at conforming to the prevailing orthodoxy, the
less likely they are to question what is demanded of them. Of course, if
they are especially good at appearing enthusiastic about the latest
thing, then all the better. The people in charge are always on the hunt
for the glib toady who can really sell the latest thing.

As we see with actors, a lack of self-awareness is key. Someone who is
painfully aware of how they look to others, or worries about how they
look to others, is not going to be a particularly good performer.
Humiliating yourself for laughs or applause works best when you cannot
imagine the concept of humiliation. It is why the narcissistic moron is
a well-known type in the entertainment world. An idiot who thinks highly
of himself, but never questions the script is an ideal actor.

Just as an actor who easily “believes in the project” is always in
demand, the politician who is always ready to run with the latest thing
is always rewarded. His donors will make sure he is kept in the
lifestyle he thinks he deserves. His party will always rely on him to
take point on the latest thing. Joe Biden made a long career in politics
being a narcissistic simpleton, despite stealing everything in sight.
Joe Biden is the perfection of modern democratic politics.

It is not just electoral politics where we see this process, but the
politics of the managerial elite as well. David French is a goofy
looking buffoon but he has risen to the top of the political media
because he has no shame. He will say whatever he needs to say in order
to shine amongst the other simpletons. French is the combination of
oleaginous rumpswab and narcissistic simpleton that has come to define
the chattering classes in the United States.

All of this is the result of democracy. Not the mechanics of voting, but
the belief that the general will is the moral authority. Once a society
accepts this claim, turns the mob into a god, then moral conformity must
follow. After all, if there is no agreement, the general will is
unknown, then the people are left with no moral authority. Therefore,
the solution is to impose a moral consensus and religiously oppress
dissent. The only way democracy can work is if everyone agrees.

This is why Western societies are now policed by a volunteer army of
simpletons, prodded along by the autocrats. Democracy collapses if there
is not a perceived agreement on the moral questions. Even though the
people who rise to the top are stupid, they understand the need for
consensus. This is why they so enthusiastically impose the latest thing
on the public. Who they are depends upon the belief that everyone
supports the latest thing.

None of this is to say that Dutton is wrong about Darwinian selection
pressure declining with material prosperity. That is certainly true.
Smart people made society safer for stupid people, which allowed the
stupid to multiply like tribbles. The reason the stupid are dominating
politics, however, is that democracy selects for stupidity because
stupid people are much more likely to support the moral consensus.
Poverty would not arrest our descent into democratic imbecility.
