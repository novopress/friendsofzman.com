After a week of outrages, more than a week, I thought it would be good
to do something a little lighter this week. I have been getting requests
for Xirl Science, so this week we have that and some other weird stuff I
found. Sometimes, you need to take a break from the serious stuff.
Otherwise, you become one of those rage heads, who are constantly
lecturing people all the time about how the world is going to hell. This
week is a show featuring weirdos, goofballs and people I like to mock.

The thing that often gets lost on this side of the great divide is that
we have one thing working in our favor. We are right. More important,
the people on the other side are not just mistaken. Most of them are
crazy. That coalition of fringes, as Sailer likes to put it, is a freak
show where morality is inverted. They have power, but reality is
undefeated. Their battle against reality can only end one way. It is
okay for our side to take some pleasure in watching that freak show.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. YouTube also has
the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link below. I have been
de-platformed by Spotify, because they feared I was poisoning the minds
of their Millennial customers.
