In 1980, when Ronald Reagan was running for president, the people
planning to vote for him were sure the media was biased against him.
They focused only on the bad stuff and ignored the good stuff. The
people voting for Jimmy Carter, on the other hand, thought the bias
claim was absurd. They thought the media played it as fair as was
possible in a matter of opinion. The big media players went out of their
way to prove that they were just neutral observers reporting the facts.

It seems quaint today, but if you wrote your local newspaper complaining
about unequal treatment, you could expect a reply pointing out the
examples in the newspaper of both sides of the debate. If not a direct
reply, there would be a length reply in the letters column addressing
the issue. Newspaper columnists would often take the time to address the
“alleged bias in the media”. Back then, it was important to the media
that people thought they were neutral observers.

Fast forward twenty years and the people planning to vote for Bush still
thought the media was biased, but by that point, conservatives were so
sure of the bias they no longer felt a need to prove it. The center of
gravity with regards to the media had shifted after the Clinton years.
Even the people who were voting for Gore conceded that many parts of the
media were biased, but their new line was that “right-wing” media, like
Fox News and Drudge, was just as biased.

In twenty years, we moved from a world in which the consensus was that
the media was mostly honest but a little biased to a world in which the
consensus was the media was biased in favor of one side. Put another
way, a tin foil hat crazy in 1980 thought the New York Times was out to
get their guy, while in 2000 a tin foil hat crazy thought Fox News
controlled public opinion. By this point, the mass media was no longer
trying to prove they were neutral observers.

Twenty years on from the Bush election, everyone to the right of Hillary
Clinton looks at the media as the marketing department for the DNC.
Further, the only people who think the media is not deliberately lying
about everything are the nutters who watch conspiracy outlets like MSNBC
or CNN. The most popular “conservative” TV media performer is Tucker
Carlson who dedicates a fair chunk of his airtime to pointing out the
litany of lies that come from the mass media.

In isolation it is not a very interesting thing, but the media is a
canary in the coal mine for the state of the culture. Forty years ago,
most people thought they could trust the important institutions of
society. Wackos were the ones claiming the government was covering up
conspiracies and doing nefarious things in the shadows. The bulk of the
population trusted the system, even while acknowledging the flaws. After
all, humans are not perfect, so no system is perfect.

Today, the center point on the trust scale is over toward the lack of
trust end but it depends upon the institution in question. Few people
trust the media, so the center is way over on the skeptical end. Most
people think the government is a blend of incompetence and dishonesty,
but many still think the system can work with the right people in charge
of it. Big business is another institution whose trust has collapsed,
especially among right-wing people.

At this point on the timeline, the military, the economy, and technology
are the only three institutions that people generally trust. Despite
twenty years of failure, people still think the military can defeat any
enemy if allowed to do their best. White people still proudly send their
sons to fight. That is changing as it becomes clear that the people in
charge are rabidly antiwhite and jarringly incompetent. We may be in the
midst of a great sea change in white attitudes about the military.

That leaves the economy and technology as the things most people think
they can trust to be what they claim. The bad news gets all of the
attention, but most people still live pretty well in this country.
Inflation and shortages are concerning, but most people accept that it
is just temporary and will work itself out in time. Similarly, despite
the damage done by the Covidians, people still trust technology to come
up with reliable solutions to problems. The vaccination rate is proof of
that.

The fact is people can remain content as long as their bellies are full,
and they feel secure in their person. The lunacy of the Covid response
was annoying, but few people felt it threatened their way of life.
People were not being evicted from their homes or going without food.
The entertainments were maintained, so they had things to keep them
occupied while stuck at home. The Juvenal quote gets overused but that
is because it is true. The last two years have proved it.

The question, however, is can a society keep the bread and circuses
going when trust in the main institutions is collapsing? Trust in the
economic system is a function of its relative performance. If no one
trusts the political system or the mass media that promotes it, can we
survive a serious economic downturn? Can we survive learning that much
of what we were told about Covid [was a
lie](https://www.zerohedge.com/political/wuhan-scientists-planned-release-chimeric-covid-spike-proteins-bat-populations-using-skin)?
Can we still trust the economic system when we are ruled by corporate
oligarchs?

The point of this is that when you take a long view, relative to a human
lifespan, it is hard to see a bright future for the American empire. The
arc of trust now bends inexorably toward a world where only fools trust
their institutions. The future is a world where no one can trust
anything or anyone and the only way to maintain order is through force.
If the people at the top of the institutions see it this way, it would
explain why they are so enthusiastic for authoritarianism.
