In modern usage, the terms sophism and sophistry are used
interchangeably with “inaccurate” or “deliberately misleading.” A
sophist is someone who relies upon fallacious arguments or reasoning to
win a debate. Someone can be accused of sophistry because they are too
stupid to see the flaws in their reasoning. Other times they are accused
of deliberately misleading arguments. The motivation is malice rather
than stupidity or carelessness.

This negative view of sophistry was not always so. We get the word from
the Greeks who used the word to mean teacher. A sophist hired himself
out to rich families to instruct their sons in philosophy, math,
rhetoric and music. The ability to debate in public was an important
skill for an ambitious Athenian, so educating your children to be
convincing orators was a primary goal of rich parents. A good sophist
was one who was good at making convincing arguments.

Our negative view of this also comes from the Greeks. The reason we know
about Socrates is we have the writings of Plato, who tells us Socrates
was opposed to sophistry in his day. He thought arguments had to be
logically sound and factually accurate, rather than just convincing. Of
course, Socrates was forced to drink poison by the Athenians, because he
was condemned for undermining public virtue. It turns out that the truth
does not always set you free.

The reason any of this matters is that in democratic societies, there is
a tension between these same two claims. On the one hand, winning the
crowd is vital to democratic politics and the marketplace. This was true
in ancient Athens and it is true on social media today. On the other
hand, we are a society that believes deliberate deception is wrong, so
factual accuracy is important. Winning the crowd through deceptive means
is viewed as immoral.

This tension has been at the heart of mainstream conservative politics.
One camp, the Straussians, think that winning the argument, which in
politics means winning elections, is all that matters. The alternative
camp insists that being right is what matters, even if it is not always
popular. The former camp is correct that the goal of politics in a
democratic system is to win elections, but the other side is also right
that winning elections means nothing if the result is bad policy.

This conflict is at the heart of this <a
href="https://amgreatness.com/2022/12/17/natural-right-and-the-traditional-reproach/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">back</a> and <a
href="https://amgreatness.com/2022/12/22/contra-michael-anton-and-americas-natural-right-underpinnings/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">forth</a> between Michael Anton and Paul
Gottfried over natural rights and traditionalism. Anton is a Straussian
so he is therefore unencumbered by logic and factual accuracy. He simply
wants to convince people that a society rooted in natural rights is the
only choice, if America is going to hold together for much longer.
Gottfried and others point out that natural rights do no exist and
therefore they cannot be a foundation for anything.

What you see in the back and forth is that Gottfried in his short
responses is describing things with as much accuracy as possible. He
makes a descriptive claim, while Anton, in his lengthy responses, makes
prescriptive claims. One side describes things as they are, while the
other side argues for how they should be. Anton believes he is in the
right because his proposition would solve the problem of governing a
majority-minority society, while Gottfried is right because he is
factually correct.

This conflict between the descriptive and the prescriptive is turning up
in the dissident critique of the conservative movement. Conservatives
argue that they are upholding the constitution and the natural rights
tradition in America. Dissidents point out that no matter how elegant
the arguments are in favor of conservatism and its natural rights
foundation, the results, to this point, have been disastrous. In other
words, the facts contradict the claims, no matter their intent.

The shadow over all of this, of course, is the purging of the paleocons
from conservatism by the neocons and their Straussian enablers. Free
from facts and reason, the winners in that struggle were able to conjure
the history they needed to support their prescriptive claims, which
solved a problem for conservatives. Like a python, they swallowed the
Civil Rights Movement whole and digested it into their theories of the
founding and their natural rights arguments.

That bit of history is what hangs over the back and forth between
Gottfried and Anton and it is what hangs over the dissident critique of
conservatism. The neocons and their Straussian enablers won the
argument, but to what end? What was the point of winning the argument if
the result was the present catastrophe? Anton would like to reframe this
as the old neocon versus paleocon dispute, but no amount of words can
conceal the elephant in the room. His side won the battle and lost the
war.

In the end, this is the lesson of sophistry. It can only flourish in a
culture that sees winning the argument as an end in itself. This is the
curse of democracy, which brought down ancient Athens and is bringing
down the New Athens. The truth is like a corpse in that it can never be
truly concealed. The sophists think they can weigh the truth down with
words, but like the body bobbing to the surface after the spring thaw,
the truth eventually reemerges into the life of a society.

That truth in the current crisis is that the clever arguments and
complex logical constructs of the last half century contained no truth
value. The sophist of our age profited greatly from their arguments, but
the result is the ungovernable mess that is modern America. Like Havel’s
<a
href="https://hac.bard.edu/amor-mundi/the-power-of-the-powerless-vaclav-havel-2011-12-23"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">green grocer</a>, we must now live in the
truth which means shedding the sophistry that has led us to the present
catastrophe. The truth may not set us free, but it will keep us from
being erased from the book of life.
