When I was a lad in the 1980’s, the Reagan Revolution was just starting
and being a right-winger was the hip cool thing. Those dreary lefties
with their shaggy hair and linen colors were sad reminders of what went
wrong with America in the 70’s. Low taxes, reducing regulations, free
trade, getting government out of the way and making money were suddenly
cool. Twenty years of liberalism will do that do a nation. The
disastrous results on the 60’s and 70’s meant the first step was to roll
back those errors. The fact that the state was not rolled back was
hidden by the economic boom of the 80’s 90’s.

Ever since, the American Right has been locked in the 1980’s. No matter
the circumstance, they offer up the same solutions. It is always cut
taxes, cut government and boost business. Thirty years have passed since
Reagan, yet the Right has not changed their message. A good example
is <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">James Pethokoukis in this National Review
piece</a>. He blames liberalism for Detroit’s problems. He suggetsts tax
cuts as the solution., believing people will risk their lives to live
and work in Detroit if you give them a tax break.

The men and women who ruled over Detroit for five decades did not come
from another planet. They are the product of the Detroit culture. They
were elected by the people of Detroit. They promised to do what the
people of Detroit wanted from their government. Further, Detroit is no
more liberal than San Francisco or Portland or Boston or Cambridge.
Vermont is a whole state full of liberal gay guys. None of these places
suffer from anything like we see in Detroit. Heck, everyone knows why
Oakland is not San Francisco.

The problem is this. White people like and support civil society. They
will do what it takes to make it work, even while conducting experiments
against reality. Black people like chaos and mayhem. That may seem
harsh, but chaos and mayhem are the rule every black people rule, so you
have to assume they like it. This is the iron rule of life. Societies
are result of the people. Black people make black societies and whites
make white societies. This is true in all times and all places.
Economics is a result, not a cause.

Unless and until the Right figures this out, they will be chasing the
sunset.
