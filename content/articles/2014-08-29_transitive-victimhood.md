TED Talks are a fountain of post-modern weirdness. There’s a creepy
feelies quality to these things. It really is Mercerism, just without
the empathy boxes. <a
href="http://www.ted.com/talks/meera_vijayann_find_your_voice_against_gender_violence/transcript?language=en"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This one</a> has the bonus of
transitive victim-hood. That’s where a beautiful person gets to wear the
crown of victim-hood, without actually being a victim. They just *feel*
for the victims enough that they can *feel* as if they are a victim too.

Other than her tutor coping a feel and getting mugged as an adult, this
woman may as well have seen all of these things on YouTube. In a few
cases, she just read about the events in question. Getting beat up is no
fun, but hardly the end of the world. I was beaten with a bat once. I
could not see for a week. Can I give a TED Talk?

*<span class="talk-transcript__para__text"> <span id="t-101085"
class="talk-transcript__fragment" time="101085">So throughout my life,
I’ve seen women —</span> <span id="t-106305"

class="talk-transcript__fragment" time="108171">live through these
experiences,</span> <span id="t-110964"
class="talk-transcript__fragment" time="110964">and they seldom talk

time="114137">So in simple words, life in India is not easy.</span>
<span id="t-118777" class="talk-transcript__fragment" time="118777">But
today I’m not going to talk to you about this fear.</span>
<span id="t-122295" class="talk-transcript__fragment" time="122295">I’m
going to talk to you about an interesting path</span>
<span id="t-124049" class="talk-transcript__fragment" time="124049">of
learning that this fear took me on.</span> </span>*

My sense is these Ted Talk things are aimed at middle aged women. I have
this image of matrons with dangle earrings and lots of scarves sitting
enraptured as the speaker emotes about the topic. The word “experience”
is popular with old hens. They also like “empower”  and “learning.” I
see those words a lot, usually not meaning what normal people think they
mean. This sentence later in her pitch is a good example.

*<span class="talk-transcript__para__text"><span id="t-416330"
class="talk-transcript__fragment" time="416330">But I was soon to learn
that this was not all.</span> <span id="t-419440"
class="talk-transcript__fragment" time="419440">As empowered as I
felt</span> <span id="t-421429" class="talk-transcript__fragment"
time="421429">with the new liberty that this</span> <span id="t-422879"
class="talk-transcript__fragment" time="422879">citizen journalism
channel gave me,</span> <span id="t-425236"
class="talk-transcript__fragment" time="425236">I found myself in an
unfamiliar situation.</span></span>*

Towards the end, she delivers this sentence.

*<span class="talk-transcript__para__text"><span id="t-751885"
class="talk-transcript__fragment" time="751885">Don’t get me
wrong,</span> <span id="t-753578" class="talk-transcript__fragment"
time="753578">the challenges that women will face</span>
<span id="t-756285" class="talk-transcript__fragment" time="756285">in
telling their stories is real,</span> <span id="t-759077"
class="talk-transcript__fragment" time="759077">but we need to start
pursuing</span> <span id="t-761782" class="talk-transcript__fragment"
time="761782">and trying to identify mediums</span> <span id="t-764269"
class="talk-transcript__fragment" time="764269">to participate in our
system</span> <span id="t-765760" class="talk-transcript__fragment"
time="765760">and not just pursue the media blindly.</span></span>*

I now get the image of heads exploding in the audience. What in the hell
does that mean? She may as well be speaking in tongues.

That’s the thing with the post-modern lingo in these speeches. The words
are just there to titillate the listener. One of my favorite examples is
the word passion. Women I know always have a passion for stuff. “I’m
passionate for breast cancer.” “I’m a passionate advocate for woman’s
rights.” The word “advocate” is another magic word. I once made the
mistake of telling a female friend that Hitler was a passionate advocate
too. I love that gag, but she’s still pissed at me for it.

The weird thing with this talk is that the woman giving it is getting
all the credit for being a sympathetic victim, without actually being a
victim. She’s blending gravity altering self-absorption with
exploitation of the true victims to make herself rich and famous. When
you strip away the gooey emotionalism, there’s a grubbiness to it. It’s
a modern take on the old fashioned faith healer. The only thing missing
here is the passing of the hat.
