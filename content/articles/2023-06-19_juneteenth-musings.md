Integral to the
<a href="https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=29475" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">managerial polyarchy</a> is the narrative. This is the
semi-official story for how the managerial elite believes events ought
to unfold. The narrative promotes some cause or issue popular with the
elite or it can simply work to promote solidarity in the managerial
class by underscoring the difference between the members of the
managerial class and the masses. The narrative not only frames reality,
but often it is expected to shape reality by altering behavior.

The Ukraine war has provided good examples. When the war started, regime
media figures were decorated with Ukraine flag lapel pins and instructed
to say “keev” rather than Kiev, which everyone used up to that point.
The official narrative was that Ukraine was the good guys and Russia the
bad guys. For no reason at all, the evil Vladimir Putin decided to
launch an attack on Ukraine. Soon, the volunteer army of regime toadies
online was chanting the official lines.

The concept of “no reason at all” is a standard feature of regime
narratives that are primarily about establishing a moral dichotomy. The
bad guys are always described as acting irrationally and without a
describable reason. The good guys being good are always acting from the
best and most easily understood motives. Vladimir Putin is “crazy Ivan”
capable of anything, while Zelensky is the heroic defender of democracy
who only wants to defend his country.

It is an interesting inversion of cult behavior. To members of a cult,
the rules of the cult are perfectly rational. The appeal of the cult is
it provides clarity to the members who struggle with a disorganized
mind. The member find herself surrounded by people who see things
through the same lens. On the other hand, to those outside the cult,
what happens inside the cult is strange and counter to objective
reality. It is why cults have a negative connotation. They appear
irrational.

The managerial class looks at the masses as a cult. The people who vote
for the wrong candidate in elections are not acting from rational
self-interest. They are not even acting from subjective preference. They
are irrationally lashing out out of fear and anger for no reason at all!
The role of the managerial class in the great narrative of life is to
impose their rules on these people. Those wreckers and deviationists are
cast into a role that supports the narrative.

We see this with the holiday of Juneteenth. If you lived in some parts
of the South, you may have known about this event prior to now. Most
black people did not celebrate the holiday, contrary to the current
narrative. In fact, most black people heard about it when most white
people heard about it a few years ago. As part of the ongoing pogroms
against white people, the managerial elite decided to take this obscure
regional event and turn it into a national holiday.

Of course, this holiday is part of a narrative that has been central to
the managerial class since the middle of the last century. The great
struggle is one of the main plot lines in the story that justifies the
existence of the managerial elite. The struggle is against those
backward, recalcitrant bad white people who tirelessly work to turn back
the clock and overturn progress. As Joe Biden likes to say, those bad
whites want to put black people back in chains.

Essential to the success of any narrative, according to managerial
culture, is control of the means of cultural production. They have a
materialist’s view of culture as a product that comes from the
television or the internet, rather than the result of human interactions
over a long span of time. They think they can use the media to flood the
public space with their narratives. That will change the behavior of the
masses as people will assume the narratives are true.

This has the side effect of reinforcing to the managerial class that
their current narratives are not only factually correct, more morally
correct. Afterall, everything they read in the media tells them that
they are on the side of angels. Right now, they are sure that black
people around the country are gathering to celebrate their Independence
Day with public readings of the Emancipation Proclamation. Maybe they
cap off the day by singing “Lift Every Voice and Sing”.

Reality is probably closer to <a
href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12207611/Multiple-people-shot-Illinois-shopping-mall.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">this</a>, but that does not make this
weekend any different from most weekends in the summer. In heavily black
cities crime remains an immutable fact of life, no matter how many black
holidays are created. Maybe if the energy put into these antiwhite
pogroms was directed toward cleaning up the inner-city ghettos, more
black people would live to see the absurdity of Juneteenth, but no one
in charge cares about black people, so the point is moot.

It does, however, point to the limits of narrative control. They can
bang on about Juneteenth as much as they like but it will remain an
artificial holiday that most people ignore unless they work at a bank or
the Post Office. Then they get a three-day weekend to enjoy while their
neighbors are at work. Martin Luther King Day has fallen into the same
pattern. No amount of narrative framing will change the fact that for
most people it is a meaningless day on the calendar.

There is a parallel here to Kwanzaa. This was invented as black
Christmas in the 1960’s and promoted by the beautiful people as an
authentic black event. It was mostly a joke, even among black people.
The lesson of that experience was to make Martin Luther King Day a
federal holiday. That did not quite work, but you cannot roll back a
federal holiday, so it was good enough. That is why they skipped the
marketing campaign and went straight to the federal holiday for
Juneteenth.

The limits of the narrative tool may explain the panic and paranoia that
have become a defining feature of the managerial class. Enormous effort
was put into making Martin Luther King Day into black Christmas and it
largely fizzled. This effort to make Juneteenth into black Independence
Day is following the same arc. If you cannot convince people to
celebrate a free day off according to the narrative, then it does not
bode well for other projects.
