Fifty years ago, the late political humorist P.J. O’Rourke did a piece
for National Lampoon called *Foreigners Around the World*. It featured
exaggerated stereotypes of various races and ethnic groups, along with
over-the-top descriptions meant to satirize what was called racism at
the time. The <a
href="https://imgur.com/gallery/foreigners-around-world-by-p-j-orourke-H1X8R"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">piece</a> is preserved online, even
though the magazine is long gone. The humor does not hold up, if it was
ever humorous, but it is a good starting place for thinking about the
immigration debate.

Even when satirizing the idea of racial and ethnic descriptions, the
piece cannot help but reflect the hierarchy with regards to how
Americans view the world. Fifty years ago, people could be honest about
such things, but if you could do a poll today where the respondents are
given truth serum, they would most likely rank foreigners similar to how
O’Rourke inadvertently ranked them. Of course, the race and ethnicity of
the American would play a big role in the ranking.

Black people, for example, would rank Africans at the top and East
Asians at the bottom of their list. East Asians would rank Africans at
the bottom. White people would rank East Asians at the top, because they
see them as the model minority. The tiger mom business a decade ago was
driven by upper-middle-class white women who thought the tiger mom
explained why the math club was dominated by Chinese kids. Every race
and ethnicity have their own ranking.

The one group everyone would put at the bottom, without needing truth
serum is South Asians, specifically Indians. Over the last thirty years
America has been flooded with migrants from almost every nook and cranny
of the globe. Most noticeable are those from South America because of
their numbers. In the summer, every business park and suburban
neighborhood is littered with Hispanics cutting the grass. The next most
noticed group is the South Asians.

Despite their small numbers, relative to Hispanics, South Asians stand
out because of their jarring alienness and their reason for being here.
Employers import Indians to depress middle class wages and displace
American tech workers. As a result, middle-class white people notice
them and unlike Hispanics, who white people tend to admire for their
work ethic, the Indians have a very negative reputation. Not even the
most deluded immigration romantic likes South Asians.

This has come as a great shock to Elon Musk and his tech bros. For some
reason he decided to use Christmas Day to announce that he wants Trump
to fill your neighborhood with Indians so he can win something. This set
off a multi-day firestorm over the topic of Indian immigration. The tech
bros were poleaxed by the reaction, as they had no idea how much the
average American dislikes Indians. So much so that even yelling “racism”
has no impact.

There are a lot of reason for this. Every American has called their bank
or the help line for some bit of electronics, only to get someone who is
obviously an Indian, despite using an American name. What follows is
endless frustration. Of course, we have the stories of Americans being
fired and then replaced by Indian guest workers. Now we have the Indian
phone scammers targeting old people. During Covid, Indian scammers were
on the cutting edge of Covid scams.

Daily, the average American, regardless of his race or ethnicity, is
reminded of these alien weirdos who make his life difficult. Much like
how gypsies are the one group Europeans are allowed to hate, without
being called racist, Indians are becoming that group for Americans. It
is perhaps not a coincidence that the origin of the people called
gypsies is most likely the Indian subcontinent. Regardless, when it
comes to South Asians, Americans of all types have a negative opinion.

There are justifiable reasons for this growing anti-Indian sentiment.
The main reason is we do not need Indians. No one has ever said, “This
place would be perfect if we fill it up with Indians.” All the arguments
in favor of importing Indians do not hold up to scrutiny, so people
assume those are deliberate lies. When the official explanation is not
trusted, then people are free to conjure their one explanation. Vivek
Ramaswamy discovered that when he came out in favor of infinite Indians.

The immediate assumption was that he was in favor of importing his
countryman to take your job and take over your neighborhood because they
are his countryman. That puts a massive hole in his image as the example
of the “New American.” In fact, in
<a href="https://x.com/VivekGRamaswamy/status/1872312139945234507"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">one tweet</a> he may have created a
majority in favor of not just ending immigration from India, but
starting the remigration process. Of course, it also makes it impossible
for him to cry racism when he is clearly motivated by race.

Given that Musk and his tech bros were deluged with negative comments,
we may have just witnessed a preference cascade with regards to Indians,
but perhaps also with immigration in general. Five years ago, Musk would
have been able to get away with this, because people would have assumed
it was immoral to oppose immigration, much less Indian immigration. Now
they are seeing that most everyone around them holds the same negative
view of immigration, especially from India.

Immigration patriots are also helped by the fact that the so called tech
bros are mostly flim-flam men. Silicon Valley stopped innovating long
ago and now relies of financial legerdemain for skim billions for the
economy. Vivek Ramaswamy is a pretty good example of this reality. Look
at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Ramaswamy" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">how he got rich</a> and you wonder how he is not sitting
in a federal prison, which is itself a reminder that the people
promoting Indian immigration are not the most honest people in America.

It is not all good news. In response to getting blasted on his own
platform, Musk has rolled out a new censorship scheme so he and his tech
bros will not get the sads reading their feed. Regardless of what the
people think, the oligarchs are going to plow ahead with their nation
wrecking schemes. Even so, as Asad just learned, you cannot rule over a
hostile public forever. This Twitter event was not Ceausescu’s famous
last
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcRWiz1PhKU" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">speech</a>, but perhaps a foreshadowing of what is to
come.
