For a few years now, I have been getting requests from readers wondering
how they can donate to my efforts. I’ve always told them to donate to
VDare, Steve Sailer or a good YouTuber like RamZPaul, as I don’t have a
mechanism for accepting money. It’s not that I don’t like money or I am
selfless. It’s just that the costs were minimum and there are others out
there who could use the money. There’s also a cost to setting up a
finding apparatus, especially in an age of woke capitalism and
systematic de-platforming.

I’ve also been asked by other content creators to join the merchant
right, because it helps reinforce the notion that a culture war is not
won on love. It takes money to run these sites and many of the people
doing it have no other way to make a living. If you are a guy who has
been anathematized due to your politics, you need to get support from
people in this thing so you can live. Part of building that support
structure is building a culture of giving where we support our guys with
more than just snarky comments and clever banter.

While I like money and the culture argument is persuasive, I’ve been
slow to come around to the idea. The recent issue with upgrading my
server has caused me to rethink things, as there is now a real cost to
running this side. The new server now comes with a hefty fee every
month, compared to what I was doing. Now is probably a good time to test
the waters and see if being a media whore is for me. I’ve created a
<a href="https://www.subscribestar.com/the-z-blog"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SubscribeStar</a> account for
people to contribute to my work. If you feel generous, please sign up.

Now, I’m not entirely sure I am cut out to be a media whore, so I’m
starting with a modest goal and one funding mechanism. I think I should
begin creating some premium content as a reward to those who contribute.
That seems to be the model popular with independent media, but I’m still
noodling that one. RamZPaul does videos just for his subscribers. The
TRS guys have a paywall that does the same thing. I’m still
investigating how others handle that part of it, so feel free to offer
suggestions and examples.

The other thing I’m looking at doing is crowdsourcing a book effort. I
have been working on a book. I hope to have the first draft done this
fall. Since I’m a terrible editor, I will need to hire a professional to
edit the copy. I’m thinking the way to do that is with a crowd-sourcing
effort, but I’m still looking at how that works. I might just setup
something myself, but that would require a merchant account and some
changes to the site. Alternatively, I could raise money for the project
and then just give the book away on the site. We’ll see.

The bottom line is I am sticking my toes into the merchant waters. If
anyone has suggestions on this front, feel free to offer them up. There
are a lot of people making a living as a solo content producers, so I’m
not breaking new ground, but maybe doing what everyone else is doing is
not the right course for me. Like it or not, I’m a bit of an outlier in
the dissident media, so I may have to be an outlier in the merchant game
too. Therefore, I’m open to suggestions. Sometimes old puzzles need new
solutions.
