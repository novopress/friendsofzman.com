I had an exchange last week with someone about the future of the
country. Specifically the future of the country after the Republicans
push through another amnesty. His point, one with which I largely agree,
is that amnesty pretty much ends the Right as a force in American
politics. The Right has very little influence now, but it is an obstacle
that causes problems for the Left and their enablers.

Classical Liberalism, the only post-Christian alternative to the the
radicalism we typically associate with the Left, will die out in a
America with another 30-50 million third world citizens. If these
newcomers really wanted western style civil order, they would institute
it in their own lands. They don’t, which is why their home countries are
something other than orderly. Bringing tens of millions of people who
prefer the dynamics of a banana republic means America will become a
banana republic.

The argument that these people will l change once they land on the magic
soil of America is crazy, given what we know about democracy. Both
parties will change in order to appeal to the sensibilities of the new
imported peasant class. The political parties will resemble what we see
in Europe, one form of socialism versus other forms of socialism, along
with some multicultural stuff. Anything resembling the chamber of
commerce style conservatism of the GOP will be on the fringe.

No nation is perfect and a “propositional” nation like America is always
going to be at odds with itself over the defects. As long as the country
is overwhelmingly white, it beats the homogenizing and
stifling conformity forced on the citizens of most civilized nations. It
certainly beats the barbarism of the uncivilized lands. The key though
is for American to remain overwhelmingly white and that’s not going to
happen now.

If you are going to love your country, loving one that loves you back is
a good choice. That has been the relation for most white people in
America, but that will soon be a thing of the past. My “countrymen” will
have no more in common with me than a guy living in China. My rulers
will see me as just another subject, no different than any of the other
entries on the spreadsheet. That’s the reason fertility rates in Europe
have collapsed. Why would anyone bring someone into a world of
strangers?
