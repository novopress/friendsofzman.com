There is a theory called
<a href="http://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/sft.htm"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Smart Fraction Theory</a>.
The very short version of it is that every human society has a
distribution of IQ’s ranging from retarded to genius. Some populations
have a high number of people, relative to human populations as a whole,
with above average and better IQ’s. At the other end, some societies
have a relatively low number of above average and better IQ’s. The
former groups have rocketed ahead while
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khoikhoi"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the latter groups</a> have
lagged behind.

There’s a lot more to it, a lot more, but that’s a useful shorthand. The
point being is the smart fraction exerts upward pressure on society. The
larger and more capable that fraction, the better able they are to drag
the whole of society upward. If the fraction is too small, you get
Zimbabwe or Detroit. The smart fraction, unable to lift the whole of
society, sets themselves up as a ruling elite, plundering what they can
from society. It is why all the money in the world will not change the
character of these societies.

There’s another fraction, one that is at the heart of what ails the
West. That’s the nuisance segment. For example, I was at my favorite
lunch place the other day. It is a fancy SWPL grocery store with a cafe
of sorts. The cafe is mostly a big buffet, but buffets are working class
so they splash the word “cafe” all over the place and stock the bar with
weird stuff from foreign lands. The most popular food is the typical
American stuff, but the sushi and Indian food makes everyone feel
better.

Anyway, there’s not a ton of room for people to navigate the serving
areas. Inevitably, there will be a few mothers with baby carriages
mucking up the works. A few vibrant people will be there with grocery
carriages jamming up the walkways. As a result the store has had to
rearrange the place a few times to try and get ahead of the nuisance
segment. They have been mostly successful, but the cost of these idiots
is inevitably spread to the rest of us.

On every product in your house, you will find a warning label. On the
shampoo bottle I have in my hand, there are two paragraphs explaining
what not to do with it. No one expects the stupid to read these labels,
of course. Someone dumb enough to drink shampoo or shove the bottle up
their arse is not going to read the warning label. It is just to
inoculate the company from the inevitable. The direct cost of litigation
is 2% in America. The cost in warning labels is equal that or more. The
stupid cost us at least 5% of GDP a year in direct costs.

That’s not the end of it. The regulatory bureaucracy which is the direct
result of the nuisance fraction is enormous. So far Obama has added
12,000 pages of regulations to the quarter million or so already on the
books. The exact number and nature of Federal crimes has now reached the
point where <a
href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304319804576389601079728920"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it cannot be counted</a>.  We
are perilously close to the point where it is just assumed that
everything is a violation of the law. In such a land, there are no laws.
The people inevitably respond accordingly.

Reading first millennium history, one thing that jumps out is the high
cost of being foolish. This was especially true of the elites.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peada" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">King Peada</a> was murdered by his wife because he
foolishly thought his connection with Oswiu, through his marriage to his
daughter Alchflaed, would protect him. History of this period is full of
examples where small mistakes in judgment resulted in death, often
gruesome death. The nitwits pushing a cart through the buffet line never
would have made it to adulthood in that era.
