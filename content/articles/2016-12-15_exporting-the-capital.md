Sitting in traffic on the Capital Beltway, I started wondering at what
point the city just seizes up due to the overload. I was at one of the
well known choke points that is just about impossible to avoid, but
there are few spots around the beltway that are ever moving at maximum
speed. The snarl I was in was at 7:30 PM, which is not all that unusual
for DC. The fact is, the major highways around the District are well
beyond capacity and there is not much that can be done about it.

It’s not just the beltway or inside it. Northern Virginia has traffic
that reminds me of Los Angeles. In fact, the area is a lot like LA now.
They say Washington is Hollywood for ugly people and the residential
areas now have a similar vibe. It’s that feeling that the people who
laid out the roads and neighborhoods were always in crisis mode, putting
down streets and houses in an effort to keep pace with the flood of new
people. The result is large scale suburban chaos.

Hassling through traffic, I started thinking about the new idea liberals
have to reconnect with the little people in flyover country. <a

hinterlands</a>.

Now, the idiocy of this lies in the general snottiness of the
article. Matthew Yglesias is known for being one of those smug stupid
people the managerial class is so good at producing. Even so, it would
be a good way for solving what is becoming a critical problem in the
Imperial Capital. There’s simply no more room. We’re full. In fact,
we’re beyond full. Shipping out some of the agencies to places without a
lot of people would fix two problems.

Obviously, it ships the people out of the capital, alleviating some of
the congestion. Sending Housing and Urban Development to Detroit would
be good for Detroit and good for the capital. Detroit has a need for
urban development so putting the urban developers right there in the
Motor City would be a marriage made in heaven. Even better, Detroit has
lots of slums that were in no small way created by the idiocy of the
Department of Housing and urban Development.

Now, a lot of government is already spread all over the country. Social
Security has a huge facility outside Baltimore. West Virginia is dotted
with Federal buildings thanks to former Klansman and US Senator,
Robert Byrd. Alaska also has a lot of government due to the vast
amount of natural resources that need managing. Still, some states, like
Maine, have almost no big Federal installations. Putting the Department
of Interior in Caribou Maine would be great for the state economy.

The major benefit of distributing these departments would not be
economic. The real benefit is they would lose their value as nesting
places for the army of tax eaters and their private sector analogs. If a
middle management job with the government meant a posting in Caribou
Maine, current temperature -18° C, I’m thinking many of those jobs would
go unfilled. Even better, if that department secretary had to phone it
in for cabinet meetings, I’m thinking Congress loses interest in them.

Let’s hope the Progs get their wish and we ship the plague of Washington
out to the rest of you!
