Tyler Cowen likes to pretend the world started doing interesting stuff
when he started noticing it, but human relations have not changed much
forever. I saw <a
href="http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/new-dating-app-caters-rich-weeding-out-poor-n219571"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">this on his site</a>. I think he called
in average is over in dating or something equally stupid.

*A new dating app called Luxy matches wealthy singles…to wealthy
singles. It describes itself as “Tinder, minus the poor people.” The
app’s iTunes page claims members are CEOs, investors, millionaires, and
fitness models. So far, there are 3,000 users, and the average male
user’s income is $200,000, company spokesman Darren Shuster told Vice.
Shuster also told CNN that Luxy’s rich clientele is self-regulating and
the app does not (yet) enforce salary verification. “If you show up in a
20-year-old VW Bug, and request to meet at McDonald’s, you won’t last
very long on LUXY,” Shuster said. “It doesn’t take long to weed out
those who belong on a different kind of dating site.” The app is so
controversial that the CEO’s identity is kept anonymous. “With the rise
of high-speed digital dating, it’s about time somebody introduced a
filter to weed out low-income prospects by neighborhood,” wrote the
app’s nameless CEO in a release.*

Elites have been dating within their group since we have had elites,
which is to forever. The commoner marrying the prince is a fairy tale
for a reason. Marrying outside your class has always been a good way to
get ostracized. A lot of it is controlled by women. Females born into
the elite seek out the high status males in their class. They can be
quite ruthless about it, but they also have the toolset to out compete
commoners.

That said, I can see this app turning into a call girl service quickly.
If you’re a rich guy and can’t find a woman, you have other issues.
There’s a reason for $5,000 a night hookers exist. Outside of the US,
super high end “escorts” and brothels exist for wealthy clients. I
recall Ben Affleck getting caught in a Vancouver brothel when he first
hit it big. It was a $1,000 a throw, if I recall correctly. Maybe it was
some other douche bag actor, but I’m pretty sure it was him. This app
will probably turn into a a way for lonely rich guys to score a hooker
without leaving their condos.
