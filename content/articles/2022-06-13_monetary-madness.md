------------------------------------------------------------------------

A half century ago, President Richard Nixon closed the gold window.
American citizens had been prohibited from owning gold since the early
1930s, but foreign governments could exchange their extra dollars for
gold. France tried to make a run on the US gold supply so the American
government was forced to break the final link between the dollar and
gold, thus ending the gold standard. This set off a chain of events that
eventually led to what has been known as the petro-dollar.

Nixon was forced to break the gold peg because it was a fiction. In
theory, the amount of dollars in circulation reflected the amount of
gold held by the United States, but in reality, the American government
had been printing as much money as they thought they needed. The reason
the French were racing to redeem their dollars for gold was that they
knew the peg was a lie. Once that lie was fully understood, a run on the
dollar and global monetary collapse was possible.

It is a good lesson about the reality of the gold standard. It was an
example of the old adage that if you need a gold standard to control a
corrupt government, that government is corrupt enough to find a way
around it. Much of the good living of the post-war years was due to
expansionary monetary policy. The cost of that was paid in the 1970’s
with spasm of inflation and finally a recession in the early 1980’s that
supposedly put monetary policy back in order.

The thing is the money printing after the war was not a problem because
those extra dollars could find a home in the expanding American economy
and most especially in the rebuilding of Europe. The dollar was the
world reserve currency so everyone in the world was willing to take
dollars for payment. Europe was in rubble and needed rebuilding, so the
demand for dollars seemed endless. As a result, the United States
supplied as many dollars as was needed.

The monetary crisis on the 1970’s was due in large part to the fact that
Europe had recovered and no longer needed a flood of dollars. The
trouble was the American economy was dependent on the expansion of the
money supply. The subsequent negotiations that ended with the
petro-dollar and the Louvre Accords was supposed to solve this problem.
Instead, it merely shifted the target for extra dollars to low labor
cost areas like Asia and South America.

That has been the story of the last thirty years. American
manufacturing, technology and services have been shifted to low cost
areas. The extra dollars followed them in the form of investment, thus
keeping inflation in the United States low. The dollars not soaked up in
these countries came back in the form of investments in treasuries,
equities and real estate. The system let the government expand and asset
values to mushroom, without creating retail inflation.

Like the 1970’s, the place for the extra dollars is drying up. That
means they are flowing back in the form of inflation. China is no longer
the cheap labor economy desperate for investments, so they are not
soaking up extra dollars. In fact, China is a maturing economy
determined to shift from exports to domestic consumption. It is also not
willing to accept inflation from the United States and Europe. The
result is too much money in the West creating an inflation spiral.

It is not the only reason for inflation. Stimulus policies aimed at
sustaining the standard of living against economic reality are a big
driver. The supply chain crisis that is the result of decades of
outsourcing is another driver. Then you have the berserk response to the
crisis in Ukraine, which is creating havoc in fuel and energy markets.
In a complex system like the global economy, there are always many
contributing factors to the things we see in the marketplace.

One way to look at the current economic crisis is as a consequence of
the Second World War and the subsequent Cold War. The half century long
state of war in the United States and the West resulted in an economic
system designed to wage global war without operating a war economy. When
the war ended, there was no great demobilization and normalization. The
cost was seen as too high, so American leaders found what looked like a
cheap way to avoid it.

Unlike the 1970’s, the short term solution for the present inflation is
not a contraction of the money supply. The Federal Reserve is carrying
trillions of assets on its balance sheet which it has to unload. It will
now be selling those into a rapidly declining market, as asset prices
have been artificially sustained with the combination of free credit and
the flows of extra dollars into assets. The Fed could easily set off a
collapse in asset values and a global credit crisis if it is not
cautious.

The biggest problem facing the country is the lack of competence in the
decision making areas of the ruling class. The economic side is
dominated by monetarists, who think an economy is just the sum of it
money. The political class is full of carny weirdos selected for their
entertainment value. Of course, the senior generation has been
conditioned to seek good times, rather than make sacrifices. America
lacks the human capital to tackle the problems we face.

The situation facing America is not unlike that which faced the Russians
after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The cost of terrible governance
over seventy years came home all at once and they lacked the political
leaders to manage it. The Russians not only faced an economic
catastrophe, but a political one as well. They went through a decade of
chaos followed by a decade of slow recovery. That is what most likely
awaits the United States and its European dependents.
