One of the many failings of conservatism was the insistence that with
just the right argument using just the right data points, the people
they called the left would throw down their weapons and embrace them as
brothers. At the core of what later became known as civic nationalism
was the assertion that all political actors are looking for objective
truth and therefore would respond to it. The reason for political
disputes was the failure to flesh out the facts.

Politic is about morality, not facts. It is also about power,
specifically the power to impose your moral vision on the rest. Facts
have little to do with politics and are often seen by ideologues as a
threat. The diversity cult looks at the FBI crime stats as a direct
threat to their project, so they worked to suppress them. The flat earth
people insist that intelligence testing is a conspiracy of some sort.
They label it “race-science” because adding the words “race” to anything
anathematizes it.

Another thing that the conservative view of politics got wrong is that
it left people with only two choices when evaluating left-wing rhetoric.
Either the people chanting about white power structures were lying or
they were deeply confused. In both cases, it was assumed that they had
to know the truth and that the truth would either set them straight or
force them to stop lying. Untold man hours were wasted trying to explain
the truth to crazy relatives because of this.

Even now, with all that is happening, it is hard for people to accept
that the crazies are in fact crazy enough to believe the nutty things
they are saying. This <a href="https://archive.is/HnId2" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">post</a> in the New York Times feels like parody, but it
is written to soothe the nerves of the believers while they huddle
together plotting how to respond. The writer genuinely believes
Washington is being taken over by a Stalin-like figure and he and his
coreligionists are the beginnings of a great resistance to it.

This is the precursor to the forming of a narrative. The cult we call
the left operates like all cults in that it has a story to explain
itself and its destination. Within the story are stories to address the
bumps along the way as well as the victories. Soon, others will take
this framework in which the good guys are being oppressed by the bad
guys and create a narrative that fills in the details, especially the
part where they finally vanquish the monster and everyone cheers.

It is hard for normal people to accept that the writer is as crazy as it
seems. After all, he had to have sat in meetings at the New York Times
where people boasted of ruining critics of the Biden regime. He must be
aware of the doxing campaigns and the hooded terrorist gangs sent to
harass dissidents. It is inconceivable to a normal person that this guy
does not see the irony in what he is writing. The truth is he is that
crazy and the audience is right there with him.

Part of how cults respond to disconfirmation and setbacks is they create
new pleasing narratives for why things have not gone as predicted. A
month into the Trump presidency and the crazies have settled on an
economic collapse as the most probable end to the Trump tyranny.
According to the Times, the economy is already
<a href="https://archive.is/iznzK" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">reeling</a> from policies that have yet to be
implemented. The Telegraph <a
href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/02/25/economists-starting-worry-serious-trump-recession/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">reports</a> that the really smart people
foresee disaster for the Trump economy.

This gets to another thing that people struggle to accept. These people
lie. They will make up whatever whoppers they think they need for their
narrative. Extreme partisanship rewards sociopathy, so over time the
movement will be overrun by people who see no moral distinction between
the truth and a lie. All that matters is whether it serves the cause, by
which they mean does it strengthen their side or does it cause harm to
their opponents?

Despite all that has been revealed so far, as well as the massive media
gaslighting campaign last year, people still think there is truth in the
media. There is little doubt that the Harris campaign turned many people
from civic nationalist into something else, but for many, the whole
thing was forgotten after the election. It is called the Gell-Mann
amnesia effect, which is when you see something in the media that is an
obvious lie but then forget that story and trust the next story in the
same media site.

What all this tells us is that even though normal defeated crazy in
November and the Trump admin has a plan to defeat the Blob in order to
restore sobriety back to politics, the road back to normal will be long
and full of trouble. Scan the fever swamps and it is clear that events
have had no impact on the crazies. If anything, they have become crazier
now that they have shuffled off mainstream platforms into places like
Bluesky and Reddit where they are free to fly their freak flags.

Similarly, the media has learned nothing from the last decade. They put
everything they had into dragging Harris over the finish line but failed
because not enough people trust them anymore. Despite the massive
rejection that was the November election, they are now leaning into the
same tactics that brought them to this point. The employees of Jeff
Bezos at the Washington Post still
<a href="https://x.com/JStein_WaPo/status/1894760153813275124"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">think</a> they get to tell the owner of
the company to buzz off and leave the running of it to them.

While it does appear that we have reached the end of a cycle of madness,
perhaps several historical cycles that culminated in the last decade, it
is going to be a long road back to normal. The crazies will not simply
go away. They must be defeated, caged, and only released when the
conditions that created them are eradicated. The normals will have to be
trained in the new way of engaging in politics. Much like Russia after
communism, America is on the road to recovery, but it is a long road.
