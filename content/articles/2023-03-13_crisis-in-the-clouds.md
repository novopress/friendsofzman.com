restored and I have created a Rumble channel. I doubt I will do much
with the Twitter account, but I am kicking around the idea of doing some
live shows on Rumble.

One of the underappreciated properties of managerialism is how the
managerial elite begin to look like the elite of a bureaucracy. The
people at the top of the various pillars of power begin to think like
the people in charge of the Post Office in that they care primarily for
the power and privilege’s of their power center. We are getting a
glimpse of this with the evolving financial crisis that was set in
motion by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last week.

The bank started to run into trouble when the Federal Reserve started
raising rates in order to combat inflation. Rates have been near zero
for so long that it became the new normal, leading to  activity that
otherwise would never get financed. When money is cheap, the appetite
for risk-taking is high. When money has been cheap for a generation,
risk-taking is no longer seen as risk-taking. It is simply how things
are done, until money stops being cheap, which is what is happening now.

Despite the bizarre devotion to the cult of diversity by the people
running SVB, the bank itself does not appear to have been poorly
managed. To date no violations of the law have been suggested. Instead,
the bank was the victim of changing conditions that suddenly made their
model unworkable. In the world of banking, when your model becomes
unworkable it means you are running out of money. A bank without money
is an abandoned building.

SVB’s clients were mostly startups, tech companies and their
corresponding venture capital firms. The bank helped facilitate funding
for new companies and existing companies that are growing. Private
investors kept their money at the bank and the firms they were
bankrolling also kept their money at the bank. Because borrowing rates
were near zero, the bank could lend to the customers of their preferred
customers, the private investors, at attractive rates.

When the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates to combat
inflation, everything based on cheap money was thrown into crisis. Those
private investors suddenly had more attractive options than startups.
Those startups suddenly found it hard to borrow money at tolerable
rates. The startups then started to draw down on their cash reserves and
the private investors began to move their money to more profitable
places, thus creating a cash crisis for the bank.

That is the second problem, the very serious problem, that has broad
implications for the entire system. To raise cash, Silicon Valley Bank
first elected to sell assets like treasuries and mortgage backed
securities. In the near zero interest rate world, these were as good as
cash. In the time of rising rates, these very low yield instruments are
not in demand, so they had to be heavily discounted. SVB had to take a
two billion dollar write down when they sold these assets.

Since every bank in America, possibly the Western world, holds
treasuries and long dated mortgage backed securities, it means every
bank has the same problem as this bank in that they have assets with a
book value above market value. Some estimates suggest there is a
trillion dollar gap in the system due to this problem. In 2008 when the
system came close to collapse, the problem was about a trillion and
half, so you can see why the bankers are in a panic.

This is where we see the bureaucratic nature of the system. Pournelle’s
Iron Law of Bureaucracy states that in any bureaucratic organization
there will be two kinds of people: First, there will be those who are
devoted to the goals of the organization. Secondly, there will be those
dedicated to the organization itself. The Iron Law states that in every
case the second group will gain and keep control of the organization. It
will write the rules, and control promotions within the organization.

That is what we see with the bankers. The people running the system care
only about the system, not the alleged goals of the system. No one ever
asked if near zero interest rates was good for the economy. They do not
care. What mattered is what is good for the financial system and the
people running it. When inflation promised to become dangerous to their
position in the system they raised rates, but now that raising rates is
threatening the system, they will stop raising rates.

We are about to have another banking crisis because no one in the system
bothers questioning what happens in the system, outside of those things
that threaten the position of those atop the system. Cheap money
underwriting <a href="https://archive.is/nWvIN" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">you-go-girl capitalism</a> makes them feel good, so they
do it. If the polices warp the overall economy and puts the middle-class
at risk, they do not care. All that matters is the internal dynamics of
the system and how it impacts the people in it.

Replicate this silo mentality across the empire and you can easily see
why the ruling class appears to be out of touch with reality. The reason
is their reality is not our reality, but the artificial reality of the
system. Right now, banking regulators are telling each other they are
heroes for working the weekend to stem a bank run, while the rest of us
see another trillion getting printed up and handed to the greed-heads
who have been looting the economy for generations.

Of course, none of these silos of power are independent. The political
silo will get in on the act when Joe Biden mumbles something about it
this morning. Expect to hear lots of statements beginning with “we did…”
from various political operatives, claiming that they are the real
heroes of this crisis. The media will adopt their usual bunker
mentality, defending the people who control their scripts. <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is an early example of what we
will see this week from the content creators.

What all this means for the rest of us is the grocery bill will rocket
up this year as the bankers are bathed in free money to save the system.
We will get new narratives from the Cloud People about how the food bill
is a conspiracy theory or maybe it is the work of the Chinese, who are
the new bogeyman. The people at the top will sleep well knowing they
have once against defended the system from the barbarians of reality who
threatened to crash through the gates.
