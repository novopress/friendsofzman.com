Imagine you are the head of a grocery chain and one of your executives
comes to you with a plan to boost sales of over-the-counter remedies.
These are the things you buy for a sore throat or an upset stomach. His
plan involves subtly infecting the customers with a mild virus. They
will get sick and then come back to buy something to remedy the symptoms
of the virus. The virus will be mild, but enough to cause most people
some symptoms in the week after having been infected.

Unless you are a sociopath, you will think the guy is nuts. Odds are you
will think it is some sort of elaborate gag. If he is serious, then you
will call security to have the guy removed from the building. The reason
is not just the ghoulish plan to poison people, but the fact that he
could think of such a thing. You would quickly start to wonder what else
this guy is capable of doing. If he is willing to poison thousands of
people to boost sales, he is capable of anything.

The truth is though, companies are full of people who think like the
ghoulish executive in that short example. For example, there was someone
at the multinational that owns the Häagen-Dazs brand who decided to
start shrinking the pint. It used to be that a pint is a pound the world
around, but no more. A pint of ice cream in the United States has shrunk
down to 14-ounces. The container has been subtly changed so the
shrinkage is not as obvious to the consumer.

Shrinkflation has been a thing for a couple of decades now. Bottles of
beer have started to shrink as well. Many are 11-ounces now. They
changed the shape of the bottle to trick the consumer. This was a trick
they started at ballgames. They made cups taller, but narrower, so they
could call the regular sized beverage a large, when it was the same
amount of fluid as the smaller size. Packaging science is now mostly
about tricking the consumer into thinking less is more.

The marketplace has always been about deception. The seller is motivated
to lie about his product and the consumer is motivated to lie about his
interest. Since the dawn of the marketplace, authorities have
promulgated rules in an effort to keep the lying to a minimum and
therefore maintain a peaceful market. Those rules have fallen away in
the modern age, where deception has now become a virtue. In this age,
only suckers are honest in their dealings.

Mass media is the prime example. The big media operations publish
stories that they know are false when they post them. They are not
simply wrong about a few facts, but deliberately designed by a staff of
people to tell a false story. We saw that with the Russian collusion
hoax in the Trump years. The Post and Times had teams whose job was to
make up fake stories, with the help of friends in government. Everyone
involved volunteered for the job of deceiving the public.

We see this with the war coverage. This
[story](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-march-16)
is being pushed by the Drudge alternative called Revolver News. It looks
very official, but a quick search of the three authors reveals they are
Ukrainian activists sponsored by the usual suspects. All three are
children, fresh from school, with no experience in this area. The people
behind that institute had them do the copy editing and let them put
their name on it in order to add to their resume. It is a common fraud
in Washington.

That is the thing though. It is a swindle and a well-known one.
Operations like “Institute for the Study of War” are just lie machines.
Their task is to pump out regime friendly information that will get
circulated by the media. The media, of course, knows this better than
anyone, but they choose to pass it along anyway. Given what we saw in
the Trump years, it is possible that the Washington Post put out an RFP
for a fake study to fit the latest narrative on the war.

Joseph de Maistre famously said, “False opinions are like false money,
struck first of all by guilty men and thereafter circulated by honest
people who perpetuate the crime without knowing what they are doing.”
This is true, in that the authorities in this age pump out false opinion
in immeasurable volume. Normal people inevitably believe some of it and
pass it onto friends. That gives it authority and before long [a third
of the
public](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/03/15/public-expresses-mixed-views-of-u-s-response-to-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/)
wants nuclear war over Ukraine.

Of course, that survey could be entirely fake. That is something else
that has changed over the last several decades. It used to be that
polling firms guarded their reputations by avoiding sensationalism. Now
they only care about getting noticed, so we have polling firms
publishing complete nonsense. Many are happy to give the customer what
they want and those customers are sociopaths in the media. Polling is
just a corrupt as everything else now.

If we return to our grocery store CEO and his psychopathic executive,
the issue is not the scheme, but the person behind it. The sort of
person who thinks it is normal to poison people is not going to think
twice about poisoning his boss. Similarly, the sorts of people who think
it is normal to fabricate studies, stories and so on in order to fool
the general public is no different from the psychopathic executive.
These are people who lack the ability to tell right from wrong.

It is tempting to think this is just the way the world is and we just
see it more clearly now thanks to the mass media age. Some of that is
true, but we also know that this sort of behavior was a primary concern
in the past. Medieval governments passed rules to limit deception in the
law and the marketplace. The ancients had draconian punishments for
those who deceived the public. The ancient Persians treated deception
more harshly than murder. People used to worry about this problem.

In this age, we have turned this on its head. Deception is a valued
skill. The media selects for sociopathy. Our political parties admire
those with a natural skill to deceive and quickly raise them to national
status. That grocery store CEO would not exist as described, because he
would have hand-picked that executive and probably gave him the idea for
the mass poisoning campaign. The lie is the coin of the realm and the
liars are the new aristocracy.

America is often called a great experiment and that is true. This is the
first society to exist with nothing holding it together but impersonal
economic relations. We are reaching the point where there are no rules,
just who can get over on whom. It is the anarcho-capitalist society in
which no one can trust anyone or anything. Instead, a war of all against
all, it is an endless series of confidence games. Everyone has an angle
and is trying to get over on someone else.
