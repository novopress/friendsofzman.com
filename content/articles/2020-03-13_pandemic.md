I penetrated the infection zone at 0900. For several miles I expected
guards or maybe a traffic jam, but instead the road was clear with no
signs of activity. In fact, I was not even sure I was in the infected
zone until I started to see the abandoned cars. Some of the cars had
been set on fire for some reason. It was more abandoned cars and then I
started to see the bodies. At first it was a body slumped over in a car.
Then it was a corpse in the road and then too many to count.

The road became impassable near what used to be an old roadside stop. A
set of stores on one side and a gas station on the other. I stopped and
got out of the car to look around. I spotted a big fellow, with blond
hair sitting against a wall. He was shirtless and looked like he had
been in a fight. He was holding a dove or pigeon. I’m not good with
birds, but it was white and the size of a pigeon. Looking around, he
appeared to be the only living thing, so I approached him and asked him
what had happened.

He looked at me and asked if I liked fries with mayonnaise. It was a
bizarre question, but I am familiar with the Dutch, so I understood his
meaning straight away. In his final moments, he was thinking of futures
past.  After some back and forth, he said to me, “I’ve seen things you
people wouldn’t believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion.
I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All
those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.”

Ah, what might have been. My trip to Old Blighty was scuttled by the
Chinese plague, so instead of doing travelogues this weekend, it is an
impromptu podcast. I did not have a lot of time to put it together, so
it is a little ragged. I figured since I was not going to be on the
road, I had no excuse for skipping this week. It’s weird, but it bugs me
when I skip a week for some reason. I feel like I’m shirking my
responsibilities. A man should stick to his commitments, no matter how
trivial.

Along the same lines, I feel bad for having to cancel the trip. I was
looking forward to seeing Mark and his folks. He is one of the better
speakers and organizers on this side of the great divide. It’s always a
pleasure to see him work. But, I think I made the right call by staying
home. This virus is serious and we need to do what we can to limit our
social interactions for the time being. Even if the alarmist are half
right, we have a very serious public health crisis on our hands.

There’s also the fact that in stressful times, reasonable people need to
be reasonable and level headed. I have people counting on me to do the
right thing, so setting a good example is important. If everywhere we
look the sober minded are taking precautions against infection, the less
sober minded will be inclined to follow. If you always assume you are an
example to at least one other person in this world, you are always
reminded to set a good example.

There’s also the practical issues. It’s pretty clear that the UK
government is less prepared for this than the US government. By Sunday
Boris Johnson could be locking down the country. We are not only into
uncharted territory in terms of the virus, but we have no idea what our
ruling class idiots are going to do. All we know at this point is they
don’t know what to do. I’m much more concerned about that than the
plague, for the simple reason I trust the plague more than our rulers.

That really is the main issue at the moment. In good times, you can have
idiots and girts in positions of authority. The last time we had a
serious crisis, there were serious men in government, who knew what to
do. Whatever you may think about the massive bailout of the banks during
the mortgage crisis, it prevented a collapse. This time, I fear we don’t
have serious men in the room. We may be about to learn why it is a bad
idea to stock government with entertaining nitwits.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

YouTube also has the full podcast. Of course, there is a download link
