rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This</a> was on American
Digest. This is when you see that the people running this country are
not *of* this country. Homosexuals make up about 2% of the population.
If BK monopolizes the gay demographic, it is a rounding error on their
financials. It’s a rounding error on the store level financial.
Pretending that homosexuals are a super-valuable market segment was
never meant to be taken seriously. It was always agit-prop intended to
justify normalization.

Now, throw in the lunatic population, which makes up a consistent <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">20% of the population</a>.
Lunatics like waving the rainbow flag because they think it offends
Christians. Note that
<a href="http://religions.pewforum.org/affiliations"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Evangelical Christians are
26%</a> of the population. Lunatics are not all enthusiastic for gays.
Male lunatics, for the most part, keep their head down and avoid saying
anything. The reason is men, even lunatic men, find homosexuality mildly
repulsive. Even extreme fanaticism cannot overcome biology.

The point being is that a  few minutes considering the numbers shows
that Burger King  is not gaining anything from this. They will most
likely piss off a portion of the customer base with this nonsense. Throw
in the fact that homosexuals don’t eat fast food and Burger King is
known as the McDonalds for black America and you have a recipe for
marketing disaster. Blacks and downscale whites loath this rainbow
stuff.

The people running Burger King, on the other hand, live in their ruling
class echo chamber. In that weird world of pod people, everyone loves
homosexuals and thinks their cause is on par with the Civil Rights
Movement. You can be sure that the marketing geniuses that came up with
this “don’t know anyone who opposes gay marriage.” The reason for that
is they are an alien class of people wholly unfamiliar with the people
over whom they rule.

As I’m fond of saying, American has been colonized by aliens.
