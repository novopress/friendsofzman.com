**Note:** The comments have been getting bombed by Ukrainian bots, which
is why moderation has been so immoderate. This was part of the public
relations campaign around the recent offensive. It is slowly abating,
but for now moderation will remain tight to prevent a flood of nutty
comments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the old television series MythBusters, there was a scene where the
crew was doing something disgusting. The setup of the show was to
explain the “myth” they were testing then follow them along as they set
up their tests. A big part of the show was sight gags, so this meant
putting the hosts of the show in foolish situations. In one of these
setups, the camera is following one of the hosts and he looks at the
camera and says, “there is no dignity in show business.”

It was a memorable moment because we live in an age where performers are
treated like conquering heroes. For most of human history, performers
were at the very bottom of the status ladder. They were treated worse
than slaves in many societies, as it was assumed that people willing to
humiliate themselves for the entertainment of others were people of low
moral standards. If someone has no respect for himself, then he is
unlikely to respect the standards of society.

Today the opposite is true. We worship celebrity. The Republican Party
is running three celebrities in big elections this year. Hershel Walker,
the former football star, is running for Senate in Georgia. Doctor Oz is
running for Senate in Pennsylvania. In both cases, their reason to be in
the race is they are famous. In Arizona, Kari Lake was a local TV anchor
before running for governor. Her party switching suggests she is willing
to do anything for applause and your vote.

Of course, politics in a liberal democracy is just entertainment. It is
like the talent shows where the viewers are asked to vote for the
performer they liked best, but only after hearing the opinion of
celebrity experts. Naturally, most people follow the lead of the
celebrity experts, which is why they are there. Politics works exactly
the same way, except the celebrity experts are called pundits. Their job
is to shape public opinion around the two party system.

That line about there being no dignity in show business still applies.
It is why our politicians look more like carny trash than serious
adults. The coin of the realm is attention and eventually, you have to
degrade yourself to get it. People who have no qualms about making
themselves the object of mockery just to entertain the masses will be
naturals in the political game. Politics in a democratic system
naturally selects for people willing to trade their dignity for
applause.

This is most obvious in the pundit class. These are people who dream of
one day being an extra on a good television show. In other words, unlike
the people who run for office, these people think even less of
themselves. It is why their opinions can easily change from one election
to the next. If this season the smash hit is angry black guy, then they
will sign on for a role in angry black guy. If next season the show is
strong female, then they will audition for that show.

You see this with so-called conservatives. Fifty pounds ago, S. E. Cupp
played the role of naughty female libertarian on Fox. She would show a
little skin, put on the glasses and repeat libertarian lines about
socialism. That show closed so she is now playing the role of matronly
MAGA hater on CNN. Many of the people in this

declaration of war against Trump voters switched to being Trump
supporters. There is no dignity in show business, so they had no trouble
with it.

There is a funny thing about a world of no standards. In addition to
drawing in people willing to play any role just to get on stage, it
seems to draw in people who seem to enjoy degrading themselves in
public. Self-declared super genius Tom Nichols is probably the best
example. He seems to get a weird thrill out of making an ass of himself
in public. It does not appear to be just about getting attention. He
really likes to
<a href="https://nitter.net/RadioFreeTom/status/1522776831560232961#m"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">humiliate</a> himself on-line.

Just look at the first line of that Twitter post. “In forty years of
studying Russia the thing I always struggled to get my arms around is
that this remarkable and immense nation, a source of cultural and
scientific genius, is also so riven by ignorance and insecurity that it
is incapable of living in peace with the world.” This is a man who lives
in a country that has been at war with the world for most of its
existence. His cult is responsible for more dead people than Genghis
Khan.

That whole series of posts is like someone had decided to lampoon the
Trotsky cult we call neoconservatism by conjuring an absurd character
that embodies an exaggerated version of its qualities. That ridiculous
person then does ridiculous things to highlight the absurdity of his
group. Tom Nichols is the Mr. Bean of neoconservatism and he is thrilled
to play the part. One gets the sense that if Bill Kristol says the role
could use some clown nose, Nichols is dressing as a clown.

It is possible that Nichols is so devoid of self-awareness that he does
not see the absurdity in his act. In fact, this is a possible clue to
why many celebrities seem to think highly of themselves, despite what
they do for a living. Ocasio-Cortez, for example, thinks she is a world
historical figure. It could be that a total lack of self-respect rests
on a total lack of self-awareness. If you cannot tell when they are
laughing at you rather than with you, then it does not matter.

The Founders never imagined that the country they were creating would
one day lead to rule by circus freak, but they understood the risk of
democracy. They knew that a system that relied on the shifting opinion
of the masses would attract those who are good at appealing to the
masses, but not good at governing. We see this today as our political
system looks like a bad TV show. It is full of people who are good at
getting public attention, but they are not good at anything else.

What no one anticipated is that rule by circus freak has degraded all of
society, along with the people on the stage. To sit in the crowd,
applauding as a man humiliates himself for your amusement, debases you
as much as the performer. You cannot seek to raise yourself up from your
base condition when you are simultaneously cheering for others to reduce
themselves to their base condition. In a democracy, we all sink into the
ooze together because there is no dignity in democracy.
