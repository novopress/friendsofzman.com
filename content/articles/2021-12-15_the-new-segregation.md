Walk around in public and it is increasingly obvious that Americans now
live in at least two parallel worlds. For the bare-faced, the masked are
a strange and alien people who are starting to fade into the scenery.
The weirdness of these people strapping amulets to their faces has faded
and it is now just something to be ignored, along with the person
wearing the amulet. In fact, the weird collection of beliefs that lie
behind the bizarre face-gear are also fading into obscurity.

The mask is no longer about following directions, complying with
authority, concerns over public health and so on. It is about membership
in a parallel universe that occupies the same physical space as this
universe. If you want to know what segregation in the South was really
like, go to a grocery store. Jim Crow was mostly two groups of people
operating under mostly the same rules but living psychologically apart
from one another in the same public spaces.

The masked versus unmasked is just the physical manifestation of the new
segregation in current year America. Behind the mask lies paranoia and
fear about those not wearing the magic amulet. The bare-faced are Trump
supporters, possibly even insurrectionists or white supremacists. They
most certainly are not vaccinated and therefore carry the latest letter
of the Greek alphabet. These are the people against whom the elect are
chosen to wage the holy war.

It sounds insane, but it is a generous description of the people living
in the parallel universe that is the Left in America. Theirs is a world
of magic and miracles where dark forces are resisted by the forces of
light. They cannot explain how this works, but they have plenty of
examples. The massive tornadoes that hit the bad people in Trump country
were the wrath of Gaia. She is angry over climate change so she sent
another <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/13/politics/joe-biden-tornadoes-climate-politics/index.html"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">warning</a> to the sinners.

Exactly no one in the Gaia cult can explain how any of this works, but
that is not how religions work anyway. The rituals and incantations are
simple ways for the believer to show she is a believer, without knowing
the logic of the belief. The overlap between Gaia worshippers and
Covidians is not an accident. Both of these are viewed as supernatural
occurrences by the Left. It is why your vaccination status matters so
much to them. They have been told it matters, so they believe it.

Behind those masks is not just fear of Gaia, but a general fear of
mysterious forces operating in the universe. It is why the Russian
collusion hoax still <a href="https://archive.ph/ZJSAp" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">circulates</a> among these same people. They were never
able to explain how it works, but they just knew it because that is how
they imagine the world works. That is where you see the parallel
universes at play. In one universe, hoaxes get debunked and people move
on while in the other they become part of the
<a href="https://twitter.com/espn/status/1470868014723747843"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">canon</a>.

In the world of normal people, the great struggle of life is the great
struggle over the small things like money, family and work. Behind the
mask, the great struggle is the defense of democracy. There is a
<a href="https://archive.ph/o2g00" rel="noopener" target="_blank">war on
democracy</a> waged by those who
<a href="https://archive.md/nAT6W" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">oppose</a> democracy for some reason. The faithful need
<a href="https://archive.md/KExYp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Joe
Biden</a> to take on the real enemies of democracy in order to save it.
Of course, those who <a href="https://archive.ph/P9Wua" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">criticize</a> Joe Biden, in his noble quest, are
threatening democracy by weakening his resolve.

One interesting thing about this new religion is it is mostly a grab bag
of old ideas put to less interesting ends. For example, the crazies now
have their version of the Inquisition where they will torment suspected
heretics. Mark Meadows has been <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/14/1064068696/the-house-votes-to-hold-mark-meadows-in-contempt-sending-a-criminal-referral-to-"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">named</a> by the Inquisition and will be
brought to justice. He is <a
href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/12/i-compared-the-new-january-6-texts-to-mark-meadows-book-its-damning/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">charged</a> with using the Devil’s own
language to direct the armies of Satan. The point of this Inquisition is
to finally <a
href="https://www.justsecurity.org/78718/the-easiest-case-for-the-prosecution-trumps-aiding-and-abetting-unlawful-occupation-of-the-capitol/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">defeat</a> Old Scratch himself, former
president Donald Trump.

To normal people, this obsession with the January 6th protests is
completely insane, but lots of people believe otherwise. Behind those
masks you will find that many, maybe most, buy into the insurrection
myth entirely. Just as their magic amulet is about being on the right
side of history, the basket of boutique beliefs swirling around the
managerial class are about picking sides in the great struggle. The
“insurrection” has become a rallying cry for those covering their faces
in public.

Stand around in a public place where you can see a lot of believers and
think about something that lies at the heart of it all. Can our
societies continue to function when a significant minority of people
believe these insane things? What Covid has really done is move this
question to the forefront by bringing these people out of the shadows
and giving them constant reinforcement. Those magic amulets are not just
warding off the evil spirits, but reinforcing their faith in the new
religion.

For the last two years the normal portion of the population has been
buoyed by the hope that this will all peter out eventually. The madness
of the Trump obsession would go away once Biden was in office. The
Covidians would move onto something else once the cost of their madness
was too much for them. Wait long enough and things will return to
normal. It is looking like they can remain irrational for as long as it
takes to pull the roof down on all of us.

One of the forgotten bits of truth about the segregated South is that
without outside intervention, the system would have carried on
indefinitely. The talented ten percent of blacks grumbled about not
getting access to the elites and white merchants grumbled about the
restrictions on commerce, but most people found it workable. Contrary to
the cartoon version of the period popular with the crazies, the system
kept the peace and most people saw it as an acceptable compromise.

The lesson is that two different people can live together in peace even
if the separation is just psychological or cultural. Perhaps this is
where things are heading. There will be no return to normal. One group
will walk around with their magic amulets on their faces while normal
people simply ignore it and much of what they say. The masked will
traffic in their conspiracy theories about insurrectionists and white
supremacists, while everyone else gets on with the struggle of life.
