An axiom from the drug game that applies equally well to the political
game is “Never get high from your own supply.” Drug dealers who start
using their product usually end up dead, in jail or just another client
for a smarter drug dealer. In the case of politics, the product they
move is propaganda and rhetoric. In office, they peddle propaganda to
convince or confuse the people into going along with policy. Out of
office, politicians use rhetoric to trick people into supporting them in
their efforts.

The product of politics is the lie. Maybe the lie is just an
exaggeration, like the old line about two cars in every garage and
chicken in every pot. Sometimes the lie is a fabrication to distract
from something else. The Russian collusion hoax is an example of a lie
to distract from the FBI corruption. Then, of course, you have the Big
Lie, the lie so colossal that no one thinks it possible to tell such a
lie. The usual suspects used this against Trump, declaring him a white
nationalist.

The thing is, lies are told in the moment, but they have downstream
consequences because people believe the lies and act on them. The Big
Lie, as you know who described it, had big consequences later on. The
historian Jeffrey Herf notes that blaming nationalists for Germany’s
loss in the Great War eventually led to the blossoming of antisemitism
and the persecution of Jews. That is all debatable for all the obvious
reasons, but it is a good example, nonetheless.

We may be seeing something similar happening in America. The Big Lie
this time is that America’s problems, its very character, is the result
of white nationalism. The usual suspects could not accept the results of
the 2016 election, so they concocted a conspiracy theory involving
outsiders, Russians, and an invisible enemy within, the white
nationalists. This Big Lie quickly evolved from something popular with
cranks and the mentally unstable to a full blown collective fantasy.

According to a <a
href="https://twitter.com/KSoltisAnderson/status/1364615199685300224/photo/1"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent survey</a>, the number one worry
for self-identified Democrats are the supporters of Donald Trump. 82% of
Democrats are “extremely concerned” about the 73 million people who
voted for Trump. Right behind that, 79% are extremely concerned with
white nationalism. Just behind that, 77% are extremely concerned with
systemic racism. You will note there is a theme to all of the top
issues. These people are sure they are at war with a violent, but
invisible army of bigots.

Now, if the people buying into this were an isolated subculture that was
easily ignored, then no one would care. The one thing modern people have
mastered about modernity is the ability to ignore the crazies. These are
not isolated crazies. These are the people in control of the
institutions. They are acting on their insane beliefs, waging a full-on
war against white people in general and normal white people in
particular. Real people are suffering real harm because these people
believe the Big Lie.

One consequence of this war on white people is the growing awareness and
acceptance of Jim Snow America. White people are coming to accept that
there is a double standard against whites. They may not like it, but
they accept it as a part of their daily reality. You can see this on the
social media platforms. Gab has added tens of millions of users, despite
the claims about it, and those new users are fine with talking about the
new reality of race. There are lots of race realists now.

This is one of those downstream consequences of the Big Lie. Instead of
white people cowering in shame, they are seeking out places where they
can speak freely and talk about what is happening. The war on white
people is creating a sense of white identity that never would have
existed otherwise. This in turn is bringing demographic reality to the
attention of white people. The tens of millions who thought they were
part of the silent majority are realizing they are no longer a majority.

Another unintended consequence of the war on imaginary white
nationalists is that the morality is changing. The Left is not fighting
against “bad whites” but are now being seen as antiwhite. The Left used
to get away with the claim that they were trying to help or protect
nonwhites from the bad whites. It was always a lie and now it is an
unsustainable lie. White people can now start thinking of themselves as
an oppressed identity group. They can be the hero of their story.

There is another downstream consequence of the Big Lie. There is no way
to reel it back in when it gets out of hand. We are seeing this with the
Covid fantasy. Tens of millions have turned Covid into a religion. The
usual suspects will have to come up with an even bigger lie to counter
the Covid lie. That is what the survey of Democrats shows regarding the
Big Lie. Their coalition of managerial class whites and nonwhites are
now organized around the fight against white people. It is who they are.

The growing race consciousness of whites could be reversed if the rulers
could drop the whole white nationalist thing and find a new drama to
entertain their people, but that would mean admitting the white
nationalist stuff was always a lie. Then there is the fact that many of
the rulers believe the Big Lie. Dingbats like Ocasio-Cortez think there
is an army of Nazis outside the green zone, ready to ravish her in her
office. The Big Lie now has taken on a life of its own. It has escaped
its handlers.

This gets back to that old axiom from the drug game. The people running
the institutions are getting high off their own supply now. They are
sitting in front of a big pile of white nationalism, snorting it up as
they promise retribution. They have become the victims of their own
trade, unable to make sound decisions. Even if it were possible to back
off the antiwhite pogroms, they no longer possess the agency to do it.
They are just as much a captive of their product as their former
customers.

In the search for villains in the aftermath of the Great War, no one
thought another industrial war was possible. They could not see what
would come of the lies, especially the Big Lie, in the next decades.
Similarly, we cannot know what will come from the growing racial
awareness of whites. As the rulers assemble Jim Snow America, white
racial awareness will evolve along with it. The one thing we know is no
one learned anything from the last use of the Big Lie.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
