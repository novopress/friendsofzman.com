The main difference in form between a liberal democracy and a republic
is that the latter is defined by a fixed set of rules. The former, in
contrast, is formless as it is defined by the will of fifty percent plus
one. The republic has clearly defined roles for itself, including limits
on its power. In a liberal democracy, there are no limits, because truth
itself is just a simple majority, so the roles and limits of the liberal
democracy are whatever the people want at the moment.

When the truth is defined by the majority of the mob, this must
inevitably lead to chaos, as we can no longer live in a world of fixed
rules. Present experience suggests that rules themselves are seen as the
enemy in a liberal democracy. We see this in the language used by the
most pious of liberal democrats. They want to disrupt the status quo,
break barriers and open everything up to the world. The end of this
project is never mentioned, as it does not matter. They just like
smashing things.

We see this most clearly in the transformation of the mass media. A
generation ago the core of the media was a tool of the ruling class, but
it had lots of tentacles that functioned as a check on the ruling class.
There was a relationship between the media and the ruling class. The
media could be very useful in promoting the interests of the ruling
class, but it could also turn on its masters. The media needed to
maintain some distance as the fourth estate in the republic.

That old set of arrangements are gone now. Today, the media operates
like the Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution in Iran. Their job
is to hunt for heretics and witches, which they currently call white
nationalists. Whether real or imaginary, they exist to root out these
evil doers and expose them to the world. They have lots of names for
these evil doers, but white nationalist is the official name, the one
they chant when they seek to summon forth the arch demon of their faith.

In present day America, being a white nationalist is just about the
worst thing you can be, as it includes all of the worst heresies of the
age. It means primarily that you hate all of the things a good person is
supposed to love. If you are accused of being a white nationalist,
whether you are one or not, you are subject to the worst punishments we
currently have now. You can be *proscribed*. This is a form of internal
banishment in which you are treated as a pariah by society.

White nationalists don’t like this for two reasons. One is that they
don’t think there is anything immoral about being a white nationalist.
They point out that black nationalists do not suffer from this moral
prohibition. Jewish nationalists are celebrated. The other reason white
nationalist object to the current use of the label is they correctly
point out that the definition used by our betters is a lie. White
nationalism is just nationalism for white people, not a bundle of
hatreds against others.

None of this matters, as the accusation is enough to cause real harm to
the life of the person accused of being a white nationalist. This is why
VDare [sued the New York
Times](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/09/brimelow-new-york-times-lawsuit-097095)
last year. If the label sticks, it basically places the accused outside
legal protection, which at this time is limited to financial and
cyber-attacks, but in the near future it may include physical attacks as
well. How long before “he was a white nationalist” is a justification
for intentional homicide?

Now, the VDare case was
[dismissed](https://lawandcrime.com/first-amendment/anti-immigration-activist-loses-defamation-lawsuit-against-the-new-york-times/)
and in that dismissal we get a glimpse of why the truth has no place in
a liberal democracy. The Times, you see, never accused Brimelow and
VDare of being heretics. They repeated the claims made by others. This
is how the game is played. A pipsqueak outfit like the Daily Beast
circulates the accusation and then it is repeated by a major
publication. The Times just has to pretend they are reporting the charge
and they get away with libel.

This sleight of hand turns up all over the media. Mark Steyn, in his
often amusing
[deposition](https://www.steynonline.com/documents/11106.pdf) in the
Michael Mann case, pointed out that National Review is now claiming they
are not a publisher. You see, because they allow highly filtered and
censored comments, they now qualify as a public platform. They are
protected by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. This means
they are free to libel anyone they like as long as there are some
comments allowed on the post.

Of course, the big social media players have been exploiting this new
truth for a long time now. They do all of the things that a publisher
would do, like promote content, edit content and block content, but that
is now proof that they are not a publisher. For example, they accuse
rivals of having malware on their sites by posting warnings to their
links. If you click the BitChute link in [this
tweet](https://twitter.com/JackRussellsMom/status/1345948106760855554),
for example, you are given a warning about BitChute’s shady technology
practices.

What’s happened to the media in America is the result of living in a
world where the truth is fifty percent plus one. In a world where the
truth is defined by a majority, all the incentives shift from truth
telling to persuasion. Facts become sparingly used props in the argument
to persuade the public. Facts are sprinkled in to give the argument
authenticity in order to trick the audience. The truth is therefore
defined by who wins the argument and winning by any means necessary is
now a virtue.

We now live in an age in which we are awash in mass media, but the only
truth is that nothing in the media is true. Even provable fact is
positioned as to be in service to some lie aimed at deceiving the
public. Of course, a world without truth is a world without rules, which
is a world without limits. Anyone can do anything to anybody if they can
convince a simple majority of it. The law, which is about limits, ceases
to exist because in a world where everything is possible, there can be
no limits.

Perversely, every new law, every new effort to limit the assault on
truth becomes a weapon against the truth. We see that with Section 230.
A law to place limits on these platforms and their potential opponents,
is now a license for the platforms and their former adversaries to wage
war on the truth. The mass media is a defamation machine in service to
the most gifted liars in society. Liberal democracy has become a
theocracy in which the lie is the god and truth is Satan.

A new year brings new changes. The same is true for this site as we
adjust to the reality of managerial authoritarianism. That means
*embracing crypto* for when the inevitable happens and the traditional
outlets are closed. Now more than ever it is important to support the
voices that support you.
