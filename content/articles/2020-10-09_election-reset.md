We are a little over three weeks from the most consequential election in
the history of the republic, according to the media. In reality, this
election will probably not be all that interesting or consequential. Few
elections make much of a difference, when viewed in the grand scheme of
things. The great fear of democracy was that it would lead to wild
swings in public policy. In reality, democracy results in a shadow elite
maintaining their preferred course, regardless of the election results.

There are some exceptions. In 1960, the Illinois Democrat Party rigged
their election in favor of Kennedy. If Nixon had won, there is a good
chance Vietnam would not have happened as it did, which would have
changed the arc of the 60’s. The anti-war movement was the energy of the
cultural revolution. It also means Johnson’s Great Society would not
have happened. Probably something else would have been passed, but it
would not have been that program.

Another consequential election was 1976. Ford could have beat Carter, as
it was a very close election. [The
map](https://www.270towin.com/1976_Election/) of that election is very
interesting in comparison to what we are looking at in this coming
election. If Ford had won, he would have run in 1980, instead of Reagan,
and he may have run again in 1984. If not, Reagan would have been viewed
as too old at that point and too much of a yesterday man. The
conservative movement would never have gotten off the ground.

One possible significance of this election is that a Trump loss puts the
near-dead Biden in the White House until they kill him and install
Harris. Let’s be honest with ourselves about this. The people who killed
Epstein and Seth Rich are not going to flinch at snuffing out Joe Biden.
Harris is so obnoxious that she will be voted out in the following
election, regardless of who the GOP nominates. Biden/Harris will end up
being the Jimmy Carter in this replay of history.

In that regard, the Left should probably hope Trump wins. They got rid
of Nixon with the Watergate frame-up and the ’76 election, but that was
their high point. What followed was a long decline of post-war
liberalism. From the perspective of the Left, the mid-70’s through the
mid-2000’s was a long winter. Thanks to the neoconservatives in the Bush
years, the conservative consensus shattered and the Left emerged from
its long hibernation, but that was never a given.

As far as this election, when you strip away the massive psychological
warfare campaign being waged on us, it is rather conventional. Everyone
forgets that it was conventional wisdom four years ago that Trump would
lose in a blowout. It’s like remembering how you felt about something
long after the event. You can remember that you felt a certain way, but
you cannot remember the actual feeling. The same is true for elections,
it seems. We can recall the facts, but not the sense of it.

When you examine the facts of this election, it is looking a lot like
the last election, but maybe more so, with regards to the polling. Look
at the final polls from four years ago and the miss in key states was
quite shocking. No one but Rasmussen has bothered to think much about
why that happened. Odds are, the “shy Trump voter” is more of an issue
this time. Four years of Trump voters being assaulted on the streets
will make people much less willing to reveal themselves.

This week I have the usual variety of items in the now standard format.
Spreaker has the full show. I am up on Google Play now, so the Android
commies can take me along when out disrespecting the country. I am on
iTunes, which means the Apple Nazis can listen to me on their Hitler
phones. The anarchists can catch me on iHeart Radio. I am now on

tea, but it has a milder flavor. It’s hot here in Lagos, so I’ve been
drinking it cold. It is a great summer beverage.
