*Looking back, we had, in the person of Teddy Roosevelt, the finest
President in the history of this country. He had the spirit and
determination that matched the times and the land. Then the women got
the vote, and everything went to hell. While our boys was overseas
fighting the Kaiser, the women got Prohibition put in. Drinking and
gambling and whoring were declared unlawful. All those things which come
natural to men became crimes.*

*–The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean*

One of the more obvious aspects of the modern lynch mob is it is almost
always composed of women. Sure, there will be men tagging along, maybe
throwing in some shots of their own, but the organizers are always
women. Maybe a homosexual male will start it with a point and shriek,
but 99 times out of 100, the person organizing the lynch mob is going to
be a woman. She will sound the alarm and the rest of the coven will
arrive, ready to set fire to the wicker man.

The social justice warrior phenomenon is mostly a product of Facebook
and Twitter, as these services made it easier for stupid people to get
on-line and blast their idiocy worldwide. As a result, unhinged young
women now have easy access to a megaphone. Whenever one of them gets the
boo-hoos or feels slighted by a man, she can give a couple of blasts on
the horn and before long we have \#gamergate or some other nonsense
controversy.

That’s the most striking feature of the social justice warrior
phenomenon. It is young, unattached females. Put \#gamegate into a
google machine and the third hit is <a

rel="noopener" target="_blank">a blog run by a lonely, unstable
female</a>. In fact, feminism today is just that, lonely unattached
females looking for a purpose to their lives. Instead of snagging  a
husband and having kids, they kit themselves out like extras from the
freak show and scream at men for not loving them. Instead of tending to
children, they talk endlessly about their unused female parts.

Much of what is going wrong in the West is some version of what we are
seeing with the endless hashtag campaigns run by women. The female of
our species has a biological purpose. That’s to find a suitable mate,
bear children and raise them to sexual maturity. That’s nature’s
assignment to women. Anything else is either in support of that purpose,
frivolous or in opposition to biological necessity.

The result of a century of feminism is a society that works against the
interests of women. Young men are no longer obligated to get married and
be family men. In fact, being a traditional male is routinely mocked by
popular culture. All the pressure on men is to not get married. Instead,
males have easy sexual access to females, to whom they have no
obligation, other than cab fare to the abortion clinic.

It’s not just young females who are suffering from a century of
feminism. Middle-aged women have always faced a difficult time. The kids
leave and the mother’s purpose expires. Every man over the age of 40
understands that women often go bonkers at this stage of life. They get
into weird causes or begin to obsess over trying to look young. Because
we live in an age where so many women made it to this age without
bearing children, we now have a surplus of women like <a

At the risk of sounding like a neanderthal, Mx. Click should be
somewhere doting on grandchildren right now, not out making a nuisance
of herself. Instead, the self-defeating religion of feminism guides her
into self-destructive behavior that has led to a life of frustration.
That frustration comes from pursuing an endless list of causes and
movements that can never satisfy the biological
urge. <span style="font-weight: 300;">Her life is an endless itch that
can never be scratched.</span>

We are learning the hard way that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assemblywomen" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">Aristophanes was right all along</a>. A society run by
women can never work. And the West is run by women, make no mistake.
<a href="http://imgur.com/9E6VzbT" rel="noopener" target="_blank">This
pic</a> of the defense ministers of Europe is a regular on twitter. The
most powerful country in the EU is run by an old maid. The US could very
well install an old lesbian as president this fall. Liberal men spend
their days watching cuckold porn and trying on sundresses, while writing
angry posts about bathroom laws.

This is not a stable arrangement, which is why the West is struggling to
perform the basics of a human society. The women of Europe are demanding
open borders, which drives up their mating opportunities. That’s
biology. The trouble is the young men arriving see the women as utterly
useless as women, beyond momentary sexual release. That’s the rapefugee
crisis in a nutshell. The Muslims are right. The West is run by whores
and homosexuals.

This will not end well.
