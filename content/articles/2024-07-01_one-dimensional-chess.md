interested in watching me fumble through learning the ins and outs of
video creation. There is a post about the Sean Connery classic science
fantasy film *Zardoz*, a post about the economy and the Sunday podcast.

Since the Thursday night debate at which Joe Biden looked like a hospice
patient, there have been competing theories about whether it was a setup
in order to push Biden out of the way or whether it was just another
screwup. Basically, we have two competing theories of the crime. One
says it is the work of those mysterious people in the hollowed-out
volcano who control the world and the other theory says it is the work
of people who are too stupid to run the machine they inherited.

The hollowed-out volcano theory side had the momentum on Thursday night
as regime media started bellowing for Biden to step aside. It had the
feel of that first weekend of the Ukraine war when every talking hairdo
on television had a Ukraine flag lapel pin and was spasmodically saying
“keev” at one another. The same people who were telling one another that
Joe Biden was as sharp as a tack were suddenly competing with one
another to condemn his family for rolling him out on stage.

The weekend was full of fake influencers and insiders assuring the
internet that there were secret meetings happening at various places
where the volcano people or their envoys would tell Biden to step aside.
Bill O’Reilly, who most thought was dead, won the internet with a
Seymour Hersh style
<a href="https://x.com/BillOReilly/status/1807457358794109407"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">scoop</a> claiming that the decision to
put a pillow over Joe Biden’s face had been made. Why anyone would think
Bill O’Reilly has such privileged access is a topic for another day.

As the weekend wound down and the Great Pumpkin failed to rise from the
pumpkin patch, the new narrative was that Jill Biden was preventing
anyone from gaining access to Joe Biden in order to convince him to
retire. Anyone who knows anything about the life of presidents knows
this is impossible in the modern age. Since Reagan, the modern president
is never alone. They have no control of their schedule. There are guards
inside the toilet with them.

Anyway, this brings us back to those two main theories. It is becoming
clear that the scheme to have the early debate was not part of a
four-dimensional chess ploy plotted by the volcano people after all. It
is entirely possible that some elements inside the regime pushed for the
early debate in case Biden fumbled, but they did not have anything
planned if such a thing happened. It is also possible they pushed for an
early debate to get it out of the way, so people forget about it.

The truth is the political class no longer possesses second order
thinking. This is the ability to think about the range of possible
reactions to an action and then planning possible responses to those
reactions. People with the ability to think this way weigh those
possible reactions and then select their action in order to get the most
favorable response, so they can then make their next move. Great chess
players possess the ability to think many moves in advance.

The people running Washington lack this ability. It is why they are so
enamored with narratives that often take the place of reality. They can
only think about what they want as a final result, so they imagine a
scenario that leads to that result and then work backward to some
initial first step. It is at this point they launch their caper with
their first move, just assuming everything they imagined will follow.
Often, they celebrate as they are making that first move in anticipation
of the prize.

This is why you see the phenomenon of accrued joy. This is when the
managerial class creates a narrative that leads to their desired end and
then pulls forward the happiness they will feel for that event to the
present.
<a href="https://x.com/the_transit_guy/status/1807224501790273843"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is an example where the person
is feeling joy over an imaginary choo-choo train project. This will
never be built and will probably never get started. He can imagine it
happening though, so he pretends it will happen and celebrates as if it
has happened.

Putting that aside, this inability to think more than one step ahead is
augmented by the fact that these people are unable to think about
anything other than their own desires and how to achieve them. They
never think about what comes next. We have seen this for over two years
in the Ukraine war. Every move by the regime is just assumed to be a
game changer and there is never any thought given to how the Russians
will react or what will happen after this game changer.

That is most likely what we are seeing with Biden. The people who run
things knew he was a vegetable back in 2020. They picked him because
they hated Trump and just needed a compliant body for the election. No
thought was given to how they would manage a man with dementia, much
less run him for reelection. Now they want to be free of him and his
crooked family, so they let him stagger out on stage and make a fool of
himself in that debate Thursday night.

Again, no thought about what comes next, just the first move. It is as
if they assume that the world will magically fall into place for them
and produce a young vital candidate who can appeal to the public enough
to rig the next election. Instead, they will be left to choose from
zombies like Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer. Neither of whom have
support in the party or the general public. Of course, Biden has yet to
step aside and very well may choose to stick it out, despite it all.

This lack of second order thinking has another strange result. The
system now seems to select for people who prefer chaos over order. If
you cannot plan more than one move ahead, then a world where planning
ahead has no reward, a world of random chaos, reduces the benefit of
that ability. In other words, the mediocrities are creating an
environment in which having a mediocre mind is an asset. Their impulsive
behavior creates conditions that reward first order thinking.

What all of this points to is a random walk to the Democratic
convention. Over the coming weeks the various tribes of the regime will
make their game changing move, float their preferred narrative to the
media and create more chaos. Given his condition, Biden could drop dead
before the convention or, if Allah wills it, drop dead a week after the
convention thus leaving Harpo Harris as the nominee. Chance has a sense
of humor, but it always favors those with a prepared mind.
