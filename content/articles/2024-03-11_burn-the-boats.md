------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the things the paleos missed when they began to flesh out
managerialism in the last century is how it assumes the qualities of
democracy. This is something Robert Dahl picked up in his analysis of
American government against the standard of democracy he developed.
While the institutions of America were not democratic and could never be
democratic, the people in these institutions were motivated by a
democratic sense in that they wanted to act according to public will.

This explains, in part, how our institutions have grown increasingly
authoritarian over the last three decades, while the people running them
have become obsessed with defending what they call “our democracy.” They
do not view democracy as a process, but rather as a goal. The truly
democratic society is open, and the people freely exchange the right
ideas. Defending democracy in this sense means dragging the people to
this place, by force if necessary.

This democratic sensibility within democracy is important in
understanding the reckless behavior of the people running the
institutions. If one were to pick a single word to describe the cause of
the current crisis it would be “reckless”. Whether it is reckless
foreign policy adventures or poorly conceived domestic fads, the ruling
class seems to take pleasure in reckless projects. They operate like
gamblers with unlimited credit that they assume will be repaid by
others.

The Ukraine war is the latest example. When the Russians threatened war,
it was over the Minsk agreements not having been followed. They had a
specific set of claims against Ukraine, and they wanted help from the
West to enforce those claims, but instead they got bellicose threats
from Washington. In retrospect, we now know that the West wanted war
with Russia. Deliberately picking a fight with the world’s biggest
nuclear power is about as reckless as it gets.

For two years the West has steadfastly refused to have any dealings with
the Russians, instead demanding total surrender. Every few months the
West seeks some new “red line” to cross, hoping to provoke the Russians.
Now the French are recruiting the micronations of NATO to send troops
into Ukraine. The whole point of this is to bait the Russians into
responding in a way that will then let NATO pretend they are being
attacked by Russia so they can invoke Article 5.

Project Ukraine is a pointless and risky adventure, but even as the
Russians gain the upper hand, the Western managerial elite remains
addicted to it. Like drug addicts, they crave only the next hit of
foolish risk in this thing. So much so that they look for new ways to
make it so they cannot change course. There is a burn the boats
mentality to this project, where they seek out policies that further
commit the West to the project in such a way that no one can apply the
brakes.

This burn the boats mentality is everywhere. The immigration crisis is
not simply about border management, something that could be fixed. It is
aimed at making it a permanent crisis, a permanent project for the
managerial class. Tens of millions of illegals now roam the countryside,
raping and killing Americans. Even if a new president wants to fix the
problem, he will still be left with the tens of millions of criminal
aliens unleashed on the cities and towns of America.

One of the defenses of aristocratic rule is that it is naturally
cautious. The king has an investment in his country and people in that
he directly benefits from them. Who he is as a king depends upon the
health and welfare of the people and the land on which they live, so he
is not going to be quick to risk either of those for novelty. In fact,
he is going to be cautious of change, especially in domestic affairs,
because he has everything to lose and little to gain.

This is not true in democratic systems where the rulers have no
investment at all, as they can be replaced at the next election. Hans
Hermann-Hoppe noted that in democratic systems, the people holding
office often despise the office they hold, as they gained it only as a
steppingstone toward some other goal. The people have nothing but their
vote, so they are willing to take great risks. The result is a system
that is willing to take enormous risk for theoretical and ephemeral
gains.

America is not a democracy, but a sense of democracy is there in the
institutions controlled by the managerial class. What we have is a
<a href="https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=29475" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">managerial polyarchy</a>, where the elites use the
institutions to chase the mirage of the democratic society. Because the
goal is not real, it is maximally alluring. This is why the elites are
willing to trample the democratic process to defend “our democracy.”
What they are defending is not a real thing but the imagined end point
of history.

It is that democratic spirit that makes them so risk happy. This burn
the boats approach to public policy comes from the sense that this
condition of society is temporary and therefore the positions held by
the elite are temporary. In a real sense, those positions are temporary,
as all managers keep their resume up to date for a reason. Throw in the
fact that failure never comes with consequences and the result is a
ruling elite that operates like a desperate gambler looking for a score.

The great lesson in democratic risk taking is Athens in the
Peloponnesian War where the Athenians were determined to spark war with
Sparta. It was the Athenian decision to roll the dice on an invasion of
Syracuse that led not only to the end of the war but the destruction of
Athens. Given the similarity between America and Athens, it is fair to
assume the same fate awaits the American empire. Democratic empire will
turn out to be a suicide pact crafted by people addicted to risk taking.
